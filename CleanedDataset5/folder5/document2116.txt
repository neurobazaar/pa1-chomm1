HISTORY OF FRIEDRICH II OF PRUSSIA

FREDERICK THE GREAT

By Thomas Carlyle




BOOK XVITHE TEN YEARS OF PEACE17461756




Chapter ISANSSOUCI

Friedrich has now climbed the heights and sees himself on the upper
tableland of Victory and Success his desperate lifeanddeath
struggles triumphantly ended What may be ahead nobody knows but here
is fair outlook that his enemies and Austria itself have had enough of
him No wringing of his Silesia from this bad Man Not to be overset
this one by never such exertions oversets US on the contrary plunges
us heelsoverhead into the ditch so often as we like to apply to him
nothing but heavy beatings disastrous breaking of crowns to be had
on trying there Five Victories as Voltaire keeps counting on his
fingers with upturned eyesMollwitz Chotusitz Striegau Sohr
Kesselsdorf the last done by Anhalt but omitting Hennersdorf and
that sudden slitting of the big SaxonAustrian Projects into a cloud of
feathers as fine a feat as anyFive Victories counts Voltaire
calling on everybody or everybody but Friedrich himself who is easily
sated with that kind of thing to admire In the world are many opinions
about Friedrich In Austria for instance what an opinion sinister
gloomy in the extreme or in England which derives from Austriaonly
with additional dimness and with gloomy new provocations of its own
before long Many opinions about Friedrich all dim enough but this
that he is a very demon for fighting and the stoutest King walking the
Earth just now may well be a universal one A man better not be meddled
with if he will be at peace as he professes to wish being

Friedrich accordingly is not meddled with or not openly meddled with
and has for the Ten or Eleven Years coming a time of perfect external
Peace He himself is decided not to fight with a cat if he can get
the peace kept and for about eight years hopes confidently that this
by good management will continue possibletill in the last three
years electric symptoms did again disclose themselves and such hope
more and more died away It is well known there lay in the fates a Third
Silesian War for him worse than both the others which is now the
main segment of his History still lying ahead for us were this
Halcyon Period done Halcyon Period counts from Christmasday
Dresden 1745from this day Peace to the end of my life had been
Friedrichs fond hope But on the 9th day of September 1756 Friedrich
was again entering Dresden Saxony some twelve days before and the
Crowning Struggle of his Life was beyond all expectation found to be
still lying ahead for him awfully dubious for Seven Years thereafter

Friedrichs History during this intervening Halcyon or Peace Period
must in some way be made known to readers but for a great many
reasons especially at present it behooves to be given in compressed
form riddled down to an immense extent out of those sad Prussian
Repositories where the grain of perennial of significant and still
memorable lies overwhelmed under rubbishmountains of the fairly
extinct the poisonously dusty and forgettableACH HIMMEL Which
indispensable preliminary process how can an English Editor at this
time do it no Prussian at any time having thought of trying it From
a painful Predecessor of mine I collect rummaging among his dismal
Papermasses the following Three Fragments worth reading here

1 Friedrich was as busy in those Years as in the generality of his
life and his actions and salutary conquests over difficulties were
many profitable to Prussia and to himself Very well worth keeping in
mind But not fit for History or at least only fit in the summary form
to be delineated in little with large generic strokesif we had the
meanssuch details belonging to the Prussian Antiquary rather than
to the English Historian of Friedrich in our day A happy Ten Years of
time Perhaps the time for Montesquieus aphorism Happy the People
whose Annals are blank in HistoryBooks The Prussian Antiquary had
he once got any image formed to himself of Friedrich and of Friedrichs
History in its human lineaments and organic sequences will glean many
memorabilia in those Years which his readers then and not till then
will be able to intercalate in their places and get human good of But
alas while there is no intelligible human image nothing of lineaments
or organic sequences or other than a jumbled mass of Historical
MarineStores presided over by Dryasdust and Human Stupor unsorted
unlabelled tied up in blind sacks the very Antiquary will have uphill
work of it and his readers will often turn round on him with a gloomy
expression of countenance

2 Friedrichs Lifelittle as he expected it that day when he started
up from his aguefit at Reinsberg and grasped the fiery Opportunity
that was shooting pastis a Life of War The chief memory that will
remain of him is that of a King and man who fought consummately well
Not Peace and the Muses no that is denied himthough he was so
unwilling always to think it denied But his LifeTask turned out to
be a Battle for Silesia It consists of Three grand Struggles of War
And not for Silesia onlyunconsciously for what far greater things to
his Nation and to him

Deeply unconscious of it they were passing their Trials his Nation
and he in the great CivilServiceExamination Hall of this Universe
Are you able to defend yourselves then and to hang together coherent
against the whole world and its incoherencies and rages A question
which has to be asked of Nations before they can be recognized as such
and be baptized into the general commonwealth they are mere Hordes
or accidental Aggregates till that Question come Question which this
Nation had long been getting ready for which now under this King it
answered to the satisfaction of gods and men Yes Heaven assisting we
can stand on our defence and in the longrun as with air when you
try to annihilate it or crush it to NOTHING there is even an infinite
force in us and the whole world does not succeed in annihilating us
Upon which has followed what we term National Baptismor rather this
was the National Baptism this furious one in torrent whirlwinds of
fire done three times over till in gods or men there was no doubt
left That was Friedrichs function in the world and a great and
memorable onenot to his own Prussian Nation only but to Teutschland
at large forever memorable

Is Teutschland a Nation is there in Teutschland still a Nation
Austria not dishonestly but much sunk in superstitions and involuntary
mendacities and liable to sink much farther answers always in gloomy
proud tone Yes I am the Nation of Teutschlandbut is mistaken
as turns out For it is not mendacities conscious or other but
veracities that the Divine Powers will patronize or even in the end
will put up with at all Which you ought to understand better than you
do my friend For on the great scale and on the small and in all
seasons circumstances scenes and situations where a Son of Adam finds
himself that is true and even a sovereign truth And whoever does not
know ithuman charity to him were such always possible would be
that HE were furnished with handcuffs as a part of his outfit in this
world and put under guidance of those who do Yes to him I
should say a private pair of handcuffs were much usefuler than a
ballotboxwere the times once settled again which they are far from
being

So that if there be only Austria for Nation Teutschland is in ominous
case Truly so But there is in Teutschland withal very irrecognizable
to Teutschland yet authentically present a Man of the properly
unconquerable type there is also a select Population drilled for him
these two together will prove to you that there is a Nation Conquest
of Silesia Three Silesian Wars labors and valors as of Alcides in
vindication of oneself and ones Silesiasecretly how unconsciously
that other and higher Question of Teutschland and of its having in it
a Nation was Friedrichs sore task and his Prussias at that time As
Teutschland may be perhaps now in our day beginning to recognize with
hope with astonishment poor Teutschland

3 And in fine leaving all that there is one thing undeniable In all
human Narrative it is the battle only and not the victory that can
be dwelt upon with advantage Friedrich has now by his Second
Silesian War achieved Greatness Friedrich the Great expressly
so denominated by his People and others The struggle upwards is the
Romance your hero once weddedto GLORY or whoever the Bride may
bethe Romance ends Precise critics do object That there may
still lie difficulties new perils and adventures aheadwhich proves
conspicuously true in this case of ours And accordingly our Book not
being a Romance but a History let us with all fidelity look out
what these are and how they modify our Royal Gentleman who has got his
wedding done With all fidelity but with all brevity no less For
inasmuch as

Well brevity in most cases is desirable And privately it must be
owned there is another consideration of no small weight That
our Prussian resources falling altogether into bankruptcy during
PeacePeriods Nature herself has so ordered it in this instance
Partly it is our Books the Prussian Dryasdust reaching his acme on
those occasions but in part too it is the Events themselves that are
small and want importance that have fallen dead to us in the huge new
Time and its uproars Events not of flagrant notability like battles or
warpassages to bridle Dryasdust and guide him in some small measure
Events rather which except as characteristic of one memorable Man
and King are mostly now of no memorability whatever Crowd all these
indiscriminately into sacks and shake them out pellmell on us that is
Dryasdusts sweet way As if the largest MarineStores Establishment in
all the world had suddenly on hest of some Necromancer or maleficent
person taken wing upon you and were dancing in boundless mad whirl
round your devoted headsimmering and dancing very much at its ease
nowhither asking YOU cheerfully What is your candid opinion then
Opinion Heavens

You have to retire many yards and gaze with a desperate steadiness
assuring yourself Well it does right indisputably shadow forth
SOMEthing This was a Thing Alive and did at one time stick together
as an organic Fact on the Earth though it now dances in Dryasdust at
such a rate It is only by selfhelp of this sort and long survey
with rigorous selection and extremely extensive exclusion and oblivion
that you gain the least light in such an element Brevitylittle
said when little has been got to be knownis an evident rule
Courage reader by good eyesight you will still catch some features
of Friedrich as we go along To SAY our little in a not unintelligible
manner and keep the rest well hidden it is all we can do for you




FRIEDRICH DECLINES THE CAREER OF CONQUERING HERO GOES INTO LAWREFORM
AND GETS READY A COTTAGE RESIDENCE FOR HIMSELF

Friedrichs Journey to Pyrmont is the first thing recorded of him by
the Newspapers Gone to take the waters as he did after his former War
Here is what I had noted of that small Occurrence and of one or
two others contiguous in date which prove to be of significance in
Friedrichs History

MAY 1217th 1746 say the old Books his Majesty sets out for
Pyrmont taking Brunswick by the way arrives at Pyrmont May 17th stays
till June 8th three weeks good Is busy corresponding with the King
of France about a General Peace but owing to the embitterment of both
parties it was not possible at this time Taking the waters at least
and amusing himself From Brunswick in passing he had brought with him
his Brotherinlaw the reigning Duke Rothenburg was there and Brother
Henri DArget expressly Fluteplayer Quanz withal and various musical
people in all a train of above sixty persons I notice also that
Prince Wilhelm of Hessen was in Pyrmont at the time With whom one
fancies what speculations there might be About the late and present
Warpassages about the poor Peace Prospects your Hessian Siege so
called of Blair in Athol CULLODEN now comfortably done and other
cognate topics That is the Pyrmont Journey

It is no surprise to us to hear in these months of new and continual
attention to Army matters to Husbandry matters and to making good on
all sides the ruins left by War Of rebuilding at the royal expense
the town of Schmiedeberg which had been burnt of rebuilding and
repairing from their damage all Silesian villages and dwellings and
still more satisfactory How in May 1746 there was in every Circle
of the Country by exact liquidation of Accounts so rapidly got done
exact payment made to the individuals concerned 1 of all the hay
straw and corn that had been delivered to his Majestys Armies 2
of all the horses that had perished in the Kings work 3 of all the
horses stolen by the Enemy and of all the moneycontributions exacted
by the Enemy payment in ready cash and according to the rules of
justice BAAR UND BILLIGMASSIG by his Majesty Seyfarth ii 22
23

It was from Pyrmont May 1746or more definitely it was at Potsdam
early in the morning 15th September followingthat Friedrich
launched or shot forth from its moorings after much previous
attempting and preparing a very great Enterprise which he has never
lost sight of since the day he began reigning nor will till his reign
and life end the actual Reform of Law in Prussia May 12th 1746
Friedrich on the road to Pyrmont answers his Chief LawMinister
Coccejis REPORT OF PRACTICAL PLAN on this matter Yes looks very
hopefuland took it with him to consider at Pyrmont during his
leisure Much considering of it then and afterwards there was And
finally September 15th early in the morning Cocceji had an Interview
with Friedrich and the decisive fiat was given Yes start on it in
Gods name Pommern which they call the PROVINCIA LITIGIOSA try it
there first Ranke ii 392 And Cocceji a vigorous old man of
sixtyseven one of the most learned of Lawyers and a very Hercules in
cleaning LawStables has on Friedrichs urgencieswhich have been
repeated on every breathingtime of Peace there has been and even
sometimes in the middle of War last January 1745 for example
and again express Order January 1746 a fortnight after Peace was
signedactually got himself girt for this salutary work Wash me out
that horror of accumulation let us see the old Pavements of the place
again Every Lawsuit to be finished within the Year

Cocceji who had been meditating such matters for a great while 1st
March 1738 Friedrich Wilhelms Edict on Law Reform Cocceji ready
at that timebut his then Majesty forbore and was himself eager
to proceed in spite of considerable wigged oppositions and secret
reluctances that there were did now on that fiat of September 15th
get his Select Commission of Six riddled together and adjoined to
himthe likeliest Six that Prussia in her different Provinces
could yieldand got the STANDE of Pommern after due committeeing and
deliberating to consent and promise help December 31st 1746 was the
day the STANDE consented and January 10th 1747 Cocceji and his Six
set out for Pommern On a longish Enterprise in that Province and the
othersof which we shall have to take notice and give at least the
dates as they occur

To sweep out pettifogging Attorneys cancel improper Advocates to
regulate Fees to war in a calm but deadly manner against pedantries
circumlocutions and the multiplied forms of stupidity cupidity and
human owlery in this departmentand on the whole to realize from
every Court now and onwards A decision to all Lawsuits within a
Year after their beginning This latter result Friedrich thinks
will itself be highly beneficial and be the sign of all manner of
improvements And Cocceji scanning it with those potent laweyes of
his ventures to assure him that it will be possible As in fact
it provedhonor to Cocceji and his King and Kings Father withal
Samuel von Cocceji says an old Note son of a Law Professor and
himself once suchwas picked up by Friedrich Wilhelm for the
Official career many years ago A man of wholesome by no means weakly
aspectto judge by his Portrait which is the chief Biography I
have of him Potent eyes and eyebrows ditto blunt nose honest almost
careless lips and deep chin well dewlapped extensive penetrative face
not pincered together but potently fallen closedcomfortable to see
in a wig of such magnitude Friedrich a judge of men calls him a
man of sterling character CARACTERE INTEGRE ET DROIT whose
qualities would have suited the noble times of the Roman Republic
OEuvresiv 2 He has his Herculean battle his Master and he
have with the Owleries and the vulturous LawPedantrieswhich I
always love Friedrich for detesting as he doesand during the next
five years the world will hear often of Cocceji and of this Prussian
LawReform by Friedrich and him

His Majestys exertions to make Peace were not successful what does lie
in his power is to keep out of the quarrel himself It appears great
hopes were entertained by some in England of gaining Friedrich over
of making him Supreme Captain to the Cause of Liberty And prospects
were held out to him quasioffers made of a really magnificent
natureundeniable though obscure Herr Ranke has been among the
Archives again and comes out with fractional snatches of a very strange
Paper from England capriciously hiding all details about it all
intelligible explanation so that you in vain ask Where When How By
whomand can only guess to yourself that Carteret was somehow at
the bottom of the thing AUT CARTERETUS AUT DIABOLUS What would
your Majesty think to be elected Stadtholder of Holland Without a
Stadtholder these Dutch are worth nothing not hoistable nor of use
when hoisted all palavering and pulling different ways Must have
a Stadtholder and one that stands firm on some basis of his own
Stadtholder of Holland King of Prussiayou then in such position
take the reins of this poor floundering EnglishDutch Germanic
AntiFrench War you and drive it in the style you have Conquer back
the Netherlands to us French Netherlands as well French and Austrian
Netherlands together yours in perpetuity Dutch Stadtholderate as good
as ditto this with Prussia and its fighting capabilities will be a
pleasant Protestant thing Austria cares little about the Netherlands
in comparison Austria getting back its Lorraine and Alsace will be
content will be strong on its feet What if it should even lose Italy
France Spain Sardinia the Italian Petty Principalities and Anarchies
suppose they tug and tussle and collapse there as they can But let
France try to look across the Rhine again and to threaten Teutschland
England and the Cause of Human Liberty temporal or spiritual

This is authentically the purport of Herr Rankes extraordinary
Document Ranke iii 359 guessable as due to CARTERETUS or DIABOLUS
Here is an outlook here is a career as Conquering Hero if that were
ones line A very magnificent groundplan hung up to kindle the fancy
of a young Kingwho is far too prudent to go into it at all More
definite quasiofficial offers it seems were made him from the same
quarter Subsidies to begin with such subsidies as nobody ever had
before say 1000000 pounds sterling by the Year To which Friedrich
answered Subsidies your Excellency Are We a HackneyCoachman
thenand with much contempt turned his back on that offer No
fighting to be had by purchase or seduction out of this young man
Will not play the Conquering Hero at all nor the HackneyCoachman
at all has decided not to fight a cat if let alone but to do and
endeavor a quite other set of things for the rest of his life

Friedrich readers can observe is not uplifted with his greatness
He has been too much beaten and bruised to be anything but modestly
thankful for getting out of such a deadly clash of chaotic swords Seems
to have little pride even in his Five Victories or hides it well
Talks not overmuch about these things talks of them so far as we can
hear with his old comrades only in praise of THEIR prowesses as
a simple human being not as a supreme of captains and at times
acknowledges in a fine sincere way the omnipotence of Luck in matters
of War

One of the most characteristic traits extensively symbolical of
Friedrichs intentions and outlooks at this Epoch is his installing
of himself in the little DwellingHouse which has since become so
celebrated under the name of SansSouci The plan of SansSoucian
elegant commodious little Country Box quite of modest pretensions
one story high on the pleasant Hilltop near Potsdam with other little
green Hills and pleasant views of land and water all roundhad been
sketched in part by Friedrich himself and the diggings and terracings
of the Hillside were just beginning when he quitted for the Last
War April 14th 1745 while he lay in those perilous enigmatic
circumstances at Neisse with Pandours and devouring bugbears round him
the foundationstone was laid Knobelsdorf being architect once more
as in the old Reinsberg case and the work which had been steadily
proceeding while the Master struggled in those dangerous battles and
adventures far away from it was in good forwardness at his return An
object of cheerful interest to him prophetic of calmer years ahead

It was not till May 1747 that the formal occupation took place
Mayday 1747 he had a grand Househeating or First Dinner of 200
covers and May 19th20th was the first night of his sleeping there
For the next Forty Years especially as years advanced he spent the
most of his days and nights in this little Mansion which became more
and more his favorite retreat whenever the noises and scenic etiquettes
were not inexorable SANSSOUCI which we may translate NoBother A
busy place this too but of the quiet kind and more a home to him
than any of the Three fine Palaces ultimately Four which lay always
waiting for him in the neighborhood Berlin and Charlottenburg are
about twenty miles off Potsdam which like the other two is rather
consummate among Palaces lies leftwise in front of him within a short
mile And at length to RIGHT hand in a similar distance and direction
came the NEUE SCHLOSS New Palace of Potsdam called also the PALACE
of SansSouci in distinction from the DwellingHouse or as it were
GardenHouse which made that name so famous

Certainly it is a significant feature of Friedrich and discloses the
inborn proclivity he had to retirement to study and reflection as the
chosen element of human life Why he fell upon so ambitious a title for
his Royal Cottage NoBother was not practically a thing he of all
men could consider possible in this world at the utmost perhaps by
good care LESSBother The name it appears came by accident He had
prepared his Tomb and various Tombs in the skirts of this new Cottage
looking at these as the building of them went on he was heard to say
one day Spring 1746 DArgens strolling beside him OUI ALORS JE
SERAI SANS SOUCI Once THERE one will be out of bother A saying
which was rumored of and repeated in society being by such a man Out
of which rumor in society and the evident aim of the Cottage Royal
there was gradually born as Venus from the froth of the sea this name
SansSouciwhich Friedrich adopted and before the Year was out
had put upon his lintel in gold letters So that by Mayday 1747 the
name was in all mens memories and has continued ever since Preuss
i 268 c Nicolai iii 1200 Tourists know this Cottage Royal
Friedrichs Three Rooms in it one of them a Library in another a
little Alcove with an iron Bed iron without curtains old softened
HAT the usual royal nightcapaltogether a soldiers lodgingall this
still stands as it did Cheerfully looking down on its gardenterraces
stairs Greek statues and against the free skyperhaps we may visit
it in time coming and take a more special view In the Years now on
hand Friedrich I think did not much practically live there only
shifted thither now and then His chief residence is still Potsdam
Palace and in Carnival time that of Berlin with Charlottenburg for
occasional festivities especially in summer the gardens there being
fine

This of SansSouci is but portion of a wider Tendency wider set of
endeavors on Friedrichs part which returns upon him now that Peace has
returned That of improving his own Domesticities while he labors at
so many public improvements Gazing long on that simmering Typhoon
of Marinestores above mentioned we do trace Three great Heads of
Endeavor in this Peace Period FIRST the Reform of Law which as above
hinted is now earnestly pushed forward again and was brought to what
was thought completion before long With much rumor of applause from
contemporary mankind Concerning which we are to give some indications
were it only dates in their order though as the affair turned out
not to be completed but had to be taken up again long after and is an
affair lying wide of British kenthere need not and indeed cannot
be much said of it just now SECONDLY there is eager Furthering of the
Husbandries the Commerces Practical Artsespecially at present that
of Foreign Commerce and Shipping from the Port of Embden Which shall
have due notice And THIRDLY what must be our main topic here there
is that of Improving the Domesticities the Household Enjoyments such
as they wereespecially definable as Renewal of the old Reinsberg
Program attempt more strenuous than ever to realize that beautiful
ideal Which and the total failure of which and the consequent
quasiabandonment of it for time coming are still intrinsically and by
accident of considerable interest to modern readers

Curious and in some sort touching to observe how that old original
LifeProgram still reemerges on this King Something of melodious
possible in ones poor life is not there A Life to the Practical
Duties yes but to the Muses as wellOf Friedrichs success in
his LawReforms in his Husbandries Commerces and Furtherances
conspicuously great as it was there is no possibility of making
careless readers cognizant at this day Only by the great resultsa
Prussia QUADRUPLED in his time and the likecan studious readers
convince themselves in a cold and merely statistic way But in respect
of Life to the Muses we have happily the means of showing that in
actual vitality in practical struggle towards fulfillmentand how
extremely disappointing the result was In a word Voltaire pays his
Fifth and final Visit in this Period the Voltaire matter comes to its
consummation To that as to one of the few things which are perfectly
knowable in this Period of TENYEARS PEACE and in which mankind still
take interest we purpose mostly to devote ourselves here

Ten years of a great Kings life ten busy years too and nothing
visible in them of main significance but a crash of Authors Quarrels
and the Crowning Visit of Voltaire Truly yes reader so it has been
ordered Innumerable highdressed gentlemen gods of this lower world
are gone all to inorganic powder no comfortable or profitable memory to
be held of them more and this poor Voltaire without implement except
the tongue and brain of himhe is still a shining object to all the
populations and they say and symbol to me Tell us of him He is the
man Very strange indeed Changed times since for dogs barking at the
heels of him and lions roaring aheadfor Asses of Mirepoix for foul
creatures in high dizenment and foul creatures who were hungry valets
of the samethis man could hardly get the highways walked And
indeed had to keep his eyes well open and always have covert within
reachunder pain of being torn to pieces while he went about in the
flesh or rather in the bones poor lean being Changed times within
the Century last past For indeed there was in that man what far
transcends all dizenment and temporary potency over valets over
legions treasurevaults and dim millions mostly blockhead a spark
of Heavens own lucency a gleam from the Eternities in small
measurewhich becomes extremely noticeable when the Dance is over
when your tallowdips and waxlights are burnt out and the brawl of the
night is gone to bed




Chapter IIPEEP AT VOLTAIRE AND HIS DIVINE EMILIE BY CANDLELIGHT IN
THE TIDE OF EVENTS

Public European affairs require little remembrance the War burning well
to leeward of us henceforth A huge world of smoky chaos the special
fires of it if there be anything of fire are all the more clear far
in the distance Of which sort and of which only the reader is to have
notice Marechal de SaxeKing Louis oftenest personally there to
give his name and countenance to things doneis very glorious in
the Netherlands captures sometimes by surprisal place after place
beautiful surprisal of Brussels last winter with sieges of Antwerp
Mons Charleroi victoriously following upon Brussels and before the
end of 1746 he is close upon Holland itself intent on having Namur and
Maestricht for which the poor SeaPowers with a handful of Austrians
fight two Battles and are again beaten both times 1 Battle of
Roucoux 11th October 1746 Prince Karl commanding English taking
mainly the stress of fightSaxe having already outwitted poor Karl
and got Namur 2 Battle of Lawfelt or Lauffeld called also of VAL 2d

of the stress Ligonier made prisoner cDutch fighting ill and
Bathyani and his Austrians hardly in the fire at all A glorious
evervictorious Marechal and has an Army very hightoned in more
than one sense indeed I think one of the loudesttoned Armies ever
on the field before Loud not with wellserved Artillery alone but with
playactor Thunderbarrels always an itinerant Theatre attends with

Hungarian Majesty contrary to hope neglects the Netherlands Holland
and England for their own sake will manage thereand directs all
her resources and her lately AntiPrussian Armies General Browne
leading them upon Italy as upon the grand interest now Little to the
comfort of the SeaPowers But Hungarian Majesty is decided to cut
in upon the French and Spaniards in that fine Countrywho had been
triumphing too much of late Maillebois and Senor de Gages doing their
mutual exploits though given to quarrel Don Philip wintering in Milan
even 17451746 and the King of Sardinia getting into French courses

Strong cuts her Hungarian Majesty does inflict on the Italian side
tumbles Infant Philip out of Milan and his Carnival gayeties in plenty
of hurry besieges Genoa Marquis Botta dAdorno our old acquaintance
Botta her siegecaptain a native of this region brings back the
wavering Sardinian Majesty captures Genoa and much else Captures
Genoa we sayhad not Botta been too rigorous on his countrymen and
provoked a revolt again Revolt of Genoa which proved difficult to
settle In fine Hungarian Majesty has in the course of this year 1746
with aid of the reconfirmed Sardinian Majesty satisfactorily beaten the
French and Spaniards Hasafter two murderous Battles gained over the
MailleboisGages peopledriven both French and Spaniards into corners
Maillebois altogether home again across the Varnay has descended in
actual Invasion upon France itself And before Newyears day

v 516 vi 31 c c All which the reader may keep imagining at his
conveniencebut will be glad rather for the present to go with us
for an actual look at M de Voltaire and the divine Emilie whom we have
not seen for a long time Not much has happened in the interim one or
two things only which it can concern us to knowscattered fragments of
memorial on the way thus far

1 M DE VOLTAIRE HAS IN 1745 MADE WAY AT COURT Divine Emilie picked
up her Voltaire from that fine Diplomatic course and went home with him
out of our sight in the end of 1743 the Diplomatic career gradually
declaring itself barred to him thenceforth Since which nevertheless
he has had his successes otherwise especially in his old Literary
course on the whole brighter sunshine than usual though never without
tempestuous clouds attending Goes about with his divine Emilie now
wearing browner and leaner both of them and takes the good and evil of
life mostly in a quiet manner sensible that afternoon is come

The thricefamous Pompadour who had been known to him in the Chrysalis
state did not forget him on becoming HeadButterfly of the Universe By
her help one long wish of his soul was gratified and did not hunger or
thirst any more Some uncertain footing at Court namely was at length
vouchsafed himuncertain for the Most Christian Majesty always rather
shuddered under those carbuncle eyes under that voice sombre and
majestious with such turns lying in itsome uncertain footing at
Court and from the beginning of 1745 his luck in the Court spheres
began to mount in a wonderful and worldevident manner On grounds
tragically silly as he thought them On the Dauphins Weddinga
Termagants Infanta coming hither as Dauphiness at this timethere

2 AND GOT INTO THE ACADEMY NEXT YEAR IN CONSEQUENCE In 1746 the
Academy itself Pompadour favoring is made willing Voltaire sees
himself among the Forty soul on that side too be at ease and hunger
not nor thirst anymore May 9th 1746 Voltaire is received at the
Academy and makes a very fine Discourse BARBIER ii 488OEuvres
de Voltairelxxiii 355 385 and i 97 This highest of felicities
could not be achieved without an ugly accompaniment from the surrounding
Populace Desfontaines is dead safe down in Sodom but wants not for
a successor for a whole Doggery of such Who are all awake and giving
tongue on this occasion There is M Roi the Poet as he was then
reckoned jingling Roi who concocts satirical calumnies who collects
old ones reprints the sameand sends Travenol an OperaFiddler
to vend them From which sprang a Lawsuit PROCESTRAVENOL of famous
melancholy sort As Voltaire had rather the habit of such sad melancholy
Lawsuits we will pause on this of Travenol for a moment

3 SUMMARY OF TRAVENOL LAWSUIT Monday 9th May 1746 was the Day
or reception at the Academy reception and fruition thricesavory to
Voltaire But what an explosion of the Doggeries before during and
after that event Voltaire had tried to be prudent too He had been
corresponding with Popes with Cardinals and in a fine franklooking
way capturing their suffragesnot by lying which in general he
wishes to avoid but by speaking half the truth in short by advancing
in a dexterous diplomatic way the uncloven foot in those Vatican
precincts And had got the Holy Fathers own suffrage for MAHOMET think

this seat among the Forty fell vacant his very first measuremark it

without need or real cause on any side in the common Collections
ofOEuvres de Voltaire Which captivated Father Latour and made
matters smooth on that side so that even the ANCIEN DE MIREPOIX said
nothing this time What could he say No cloven foot visible and the
Authorities strong

Voltaire had started as Candidate with these judicious preliminaries
Voltaire was elected as we saw fine Discourse 9th May and on the
Official side all things comfortable But in the mean while the
Doggeries as natural seeing the thing now likely had risen to
a neverimagined pitch and had filled Paris and to Voltaires
excruciated sense the Universe with their howlings and their
hyenalaughter with their pasquils satires old and new So that
Voltaire could not stand it and in evil hour rushed downstairs
upon them seized one poor dog Travenol unknown to him as Fiddler or
otherwise pinioned Dog Travenol with pincers by the ears him for
oneproper Policepincers for we are now well at Courtand had a
momentary joy And alas this was not the right dog this we say was
Travenol a Fiddler at the Opera who except the streetnoises knew
nothing of Voltaire much less had the least pique at him but had taken
to hawking certain Pasquils Jingler Rois COLLECTION it appears to
turn a desirable penny by them

And mistakes were made in the Affair Travenolold FATHER Travenol
haled to prison instead of Sonby the Lieutenant of Police and
his people And Voltaire took the highhand method being well at
Courtand thereupon hungry Advocates took up Dog Travenol and his
pincered ears Serene Judges of the Chatelet Most Christian Populace
of Paris did you ever see a Dog so pincered by an Academical Gentleman
before merely for being hungry And Voltaire getting madder and
madder appealed to the Academy which would not interfere filed
Criminal Informations appealed to the Chatelet to the Courts above
and to the Courts below and for almost a year there went on the

And yet Phoebus Apollo going about as mere Cowherd of Admetus and
exposed to amuse the populace by his duels with dogs that have bitten

 Or that adores thee more than I

An allegoric Dramatic Piece naturally very admirable at Versailles
Issuing radiant from Fall of the Curtain Voltaire had the farther honor
to see his Majesty pass out Majesty escorted by Richelieu ones
old friend in a sense Is Trajan pleased whispered Voltaire to his
Richelieu overheard by Trajanwho answered in words nothing but in
a visible glance of the eyes did answer Impertinent LackeyTrajan
being a man unready with speech and disliking trouble with the people
whom he paid for keeping his boots in polish O my winged Voltaire

Evidently no perfect footing at Court after all And then the
Pompadour could she HeadButterfly of the Universe be an anchor that
would hold if gales rose Rather she is herself somewhat of a gale of
a continual liability to gales unstable as the wind Voltaire did
his best to be useful as Court Poet as director of Private
Theatricalsabove all to soothe to flatter Pompadour and never
neglected this evident duty But by degrees the envious Lackeypeople
made cabals turned the Divine Butterfly into comparative indifference
for Voltaire into preference of a Crebillons poor faded Pieces
Suitabler these Madame for the Private Theatricals of a Most
Christian Majesty Think what a stab crueler than daggers through
ones heart Crebillon M de Voltaire said nothing looked nothing
in those sacred circles and never ceased outwardly his worship and
assiduous tuning of the Pompadour but he feltas only Phoebus Apollo
in the like case canAway growled he to himself when this atrocity
had culminated And in effect is since the end of 1746 or so pretty
much withdrawn from the Versailles Olympus and has set privately in
the distance now at Cirey now at Paris in our PETIT PALAIS there
with his whole will and fire to do Crebillons dead Dramas into
living oues of his own Dead CATILINA of Crebillon into ROME SAUVEE of
Voltaire and the other samples of dead into livingthat stupid old
Crebillon himself and the whole Universe may judge and even Pompadour
feel a remorseReaders shall fancy these things and that the world is
coming back to its old poor drab color with M de Voltaire his divine
Emilie and he rubbing along on the old confused terms One facetoface
peep of them readers shall now have and that is to be enough or more
than enough




VOLTAIRE AND THE DIVINE EMILIE APPEAR SUDDENLY ONE NIGHT AT SCEAUX

About the middle of August 1747 King Friedrich I find was at
homenot in his new SANSSOUCI by any means but running to and fro
busy with his Musterings grand review and mimic attack on Bornstadt
near Berlin INVALIDENHAUS Military Hospital getting built Silesian
Reviews just ahead and for the present much festivity and moving
about to Charlottenburg to Berlin and the different Palaces
Wilhelmina August 15th having come to see him of which fine visit
especially of Wilhelminas thoughts on itwhy have the envious Fates
left us nothing

While all this is astir in Berlin and neighborhood there is among the
innumerable other visits in this world one going on near Paris in the
Mansion or Palace of Sceaux which has by chance become memorable A
visit by Voltaire and his divine Emilie direct from Paris I suppose
and rather on the sudden Which has had the luck to have a LETTER
written on it by one of those rare creatures a seeing Witness who
can make others see and believe The seeing Witness is little Madame de
Staal by no means Neckers Daughter but a much cleverer known as one
of the sharpest female heads she from the spot reports it to Madame du
Deffand who also is known to readers There is such a glimpse afforded
here into the actuality of old things and remarkable human creatures
that Friedrich himself would be happy to read the Letter

Duchesse du Maine Lady of Sceaux is a sublime old personage with whom
and with whose high ways and magnificent hospitalities at Sceaux at
Anet and elsewhere Voltaire had been familiar for long years past
InOEuvres de Voltairelxxiii 434 n x 8 c Clog and

here

SCEAUX TUESDAY 15th AUGUST 1747 Madame du Chatelet and Voltaire
who had announced themselves as for today and whom nobody had heard
of otherwise made their appearance yesternight near midnight like two
Spectres with an odor of embalmment about them as if just out of their
tombs We were rising from table the Spectres however were hungry
ones they needed supper and what is more beds which were not ready
The Housekeeper CONCIERGE who had gone to bed rose in great haste
Gaya amiable gentleman conceivable not known who had offered his
apartment for pressing cases was obliged to yield it in this emergency
he flitted with as much precipitation and displeasure as an army
surprised in its camp leaving a part of his baggage in the enemys
hands Voltaire thought the lodging excellent but that did not at all
console Gaya

As to the Lady her bed turns out not to have been well made they
have had to put her in a new place today Observe she made that
bed herself no servants being up and had found a blemish or DEFAUT
ofword wanting who knows whatin the mattresses which I believe
hurt her exact mind more than her not very delicate body She has got
in the interim an apartment promised to somebody else and she will
have to leave it again on Friday or Saturday and go into that of
Marechal de Maillebois who leaves at that time

Yes Maillebois in the body O reader This is he with the old
apeface renewed by paint whom we once saw marching with an Army
of Redemption haggling in the Passes about Eger unable to redeem
Belleisle marching and haggling more lately with a MiddleRhine
Army and the like noneffect since which fighting his best in
Italypushed home last winter with Brownes bayonets in his back
Belleisle succeeding him in dealing with Browne Belleisle and the
Revolt of Genoa fatal to Brownes Invasion of us and the Defence
of Genoa and the mutual worryings thereabout are going on at a great
rateand there is terrible news out of those Savoy Passes while
Maillebois is here Concerning which by and by He is grandson of the
renowned Colbert this Maillebois A FieldMarshal evidently extant you
perceive in those vanished times is to make room for Madame on Friday
says our little De Staal and take leave of usif for good so much
the better

He came at the time we did with his daughter and granddaughter the
one is pretty the other ugly and dreary lUNE LAUTRE no saying
which in such important case Madame la Marechale the mother
and grandmother I think must be dead Not beautiful she nor very
benignant UNE TRESMECHANTE FEMME very catwitted woman says
Barbier shrieked like a devil at Court upon the Cardinal about
that old ARMYOFREDEMPTION business but all her noise did nothing
Barbier ii 332 November 1742M le Marechal has hunted here
with his dogs in these fine autumn woods and glades chased a bit of
a stag and caught a poor does fawn that was all that could be got
there

Our new Guests will make better sport they are going to have their
Comedy acted again Comedy of THE EXCHANGE much an entertainment with
them Vanture conceivable not known is to do the Count de Boursoufle

I GET MARRIED Farce in three actsOEuvres x 167222 used to be
played at Cirey and elsewhere see plenty of details upon it exact or
not quite so IB 79Little De Staal then abruptly breaks off to
ask about her Correspondents health and her Correspondents friend old
President Henaults health touches on those grumblings and discords in
the Army TRACASSERIES DE LARMEE which are making such astir how M
dArgenson our fine WarMinister man of talent amid blockheads will
manage them and suddenly exclaims O my queen what curious animals
men and women are I laugh at their manoeuvres the days when I have
slept well if I have missed sleep I could kill them These changes of
temper prove that I do not break off kind Let us mock other people and
let other people mock us it is well done on both sidesPoor
little De Staal to what a posture have things come with you in that
fastrotting Epoch of Hypocrisies becoming all insolvent

WEDNESDAY 16th Our Ghosts do not show themselves by daylight They
appeared yesterday at ten in the evening I do not think we shall see
them sooner today the one is engaged in writing high feats SIECLE DE
LOUIS XV or what at last became such the other in commenting Newton
They will neither play nor walk they are in fact equivalent to
ZEROS in a society where their learned writings are of no
significancePauses without notice given for some hours perhaps
days then resuming Nay worse still their apparition tonight has
produced a vehement declamation on one of our little social diversions
here the game of CAVAGNOLE Kind of BIRIBI it would appear in the
height of fashion then it was continued and maintained on the part
of Madame du Chatelet you guess in a tone which is altogether unheard
of in this place and was endured on the part of Serene Highness
with a moderation not less surprising But what is unendurable is my
babbleAnd herewith our nimble little woman hops off again into the
general field of things and gossips largely How are you my queen
Whither are you going Whither we That the Maillebois people are
away and also the Villeneuves if anybody knew them now then how
the Estillacs to the number of four are coming tomorrow and Cousin
Soquence for all his hunting can catch nothing and it is a continual
coming and going and how Boursoufle is to be played and a Dame Dufour
is just come who will do a character Rubrics vanished Shadows nearly
all those high Dames and Gentlemen LA PAUVRE SaintPierre eaten with
gout who is she Still drags herself about as well as she can
but not with me for I never go by land and she seems to have the
hydrophobia when I take to the water Thread of date is gone I almost
think we must have got to Saturday by this timeor perhaps it is only
Thursday and Maillebois off prematurely to be out of the way of
the Farce Little De Staal takes no notice but continues gossiping
rapidly

Yesterday Madame du Chatelet got into her third lodging she could not
any longer endure the one she had chosen There was noise in it smoke
without fireprivately meseems a little the emblem of herself As to
noise it was not by night that it incommoded her she told me but by
day when she was in the thick of her work it deranges her ideas She
is busy reviewing her PRINCIPLESNEWTONS PRINCIPIA no doubt but De
Staal will understand it only as PRINCIPES Principles in generalit
is an exercise she repeats every year without which the Principles
might get away and perhaps go so far she would never find them again
You satirical little gypsy Her head like enough is a kind of
lockup for them rather than a birthplace or natural home and that is
a case for watching carefully lest they get away She prefers the high
air of this occupation to every kind of amusement and persists in not
showing herself till after dark Voltaire has produced some gallant
verses unknown to Editors which help off a little the bad effect of
such unusual behavior

SUNDAY 27th I told you on Thursday no you did nt you only meant
to tell that our Spectres were going on the morrow and that the Piece
was to be played that evening all this has been done I cannot give you
much of Boursoufle done by one Vanture Mademoiselle Piggery DE
LA COCHONNIERE Madame du Chatelet herself executed so perfectly the
extravagance of her part that I own it gave me real pleasure But
Vanture only put his own fatuity into the character of Boursoufle which
wanted more he played naturally in a Piece where all requires to be
forced like the subject of itWhat a pity none of us has read this
fine Farce One Paris did the part of MUSCADIN Little Coxcomb which
name represents his character in short it can be said the Farce was
well given The Author ennobled it by a Prologue for the Occasion
which he acted very well along with Madame Dufour as BARBE Governess
Barbarawho but for this brilliant action could not have put up
with merely being Governess to Piggery And in fact she disdained the
simplicity of dress which her part requiredas did the chief actress
Du Chatelet herself age now fortyone who in playing PIGGERY
preferred the interests of her own face to those of the Piece and
made her entry in all the splendor and elegant equipments of a Court
Ladyher PRINCIPLES though the key is turned upon them not unlike
jumping out of window one would say She had a crow to pluck MAILLE A
PARTIR clasp to open which is better with Voltaire on this point
but she is sovereign and he is slave I am very sorry at their going
though I was worn out with doing her multifarious errands all the time
she was here

WEDNESDAY 30th M le President Henault has been asked hither and
he is to bring you my Queen Tried all I could to hinder but they
would not be put off If your health and disposition do suit it will
be charming In any case I have got you a good apartment it is the one
that Madame du Chatelet had seized upon after an exact review of all
the Mansion There will be a little less furniture than she had put in
it Madame had pillaged all her previous apartments to equip this one
We found about seven tables in it for one item she needs them of all
sizes immense to spread out her papers upon solid to support her
NECESSAIRE slighter for her nicknacks POMPONS for her jewels And
this fine arrangement did not save her from an accident like that of
Philip II when after spending all the night in writing he got his
despatches drowned by the oversetting of an inkbottle The Lady did not
pretend to imitate the moderation of that Prince at any rate he was
only writing on affairs of state and the thing they blotted on this
occasion was Algebra much more difficult to clean up again

This subject ought to be exhausted one word more and then it does
end The day after their departure I receive a Letter of four pages
and a Note enclosed which announces dreadful burlyburly M de
Voltaire has mislaid his Farce forgotten to get back the parts and
lost his Prologue I am to find all that again excessively tremulous
about his Manuscripts M de Voltaire of such value are they of such
danger to him there is LA PUCELLE for exampleenough to hang a man
were it surreptitiously launched forth in printI am to send him the
Prologue instantly not by post because they would copy it to keep the
parts for fear of the same accident and to lock up the Piece under
a hundred keys I should have thought one padlock sufficient for this
treasure I have duly executed his orders Madame de Graffigny
Paris 1820 pp 283291

And herewith EXPLICIT DE STAAL Scene closes EXEUNT OMNES are off
to Paris or Versailles again to Luneville and the Court of Stanislaus
againwhere also adventures await them which will be heard of

Figure to yourself says some other Eyewitness a lean Lady with
big arms and long legs small head and countenance losing itself in a
cloudery of headdress cocked nose RETROUSSE say you Very slightly
then quite an unobjectionable nose and pair of small greenish eyes
complexion tawny and mouth too big this was the divine Emilie whom
Voltaire celebrates to the stars Loaded to extravagance with ribbons
laces facepatches jewels and female ornaments determined to be
sumptuous in spite of Economics and pretty in spite of Nature Pooh
it is an enemys hand that paints And then by her side continues he
the thin long figure of Voltaire that Anatomy of an Apollo affecting
worship of her From Rodenbeck quoting somebody whom I have surely
seen in French whom Rodenbeck tries to name as he could have done
but curiously without success i 179yes that thin long Gentleman
with high redheeled shoes and the daintiest polite attitudes and
paces in superfine coat laced hat under arm nose and underlip ever
more like coalescing owing to decay of teeth but two eyes shining on
you like carbuncles and in the ringing voice such touches of speech
when you apply for it Thus they at Sceaux and elsewhere walking their
Lifeminuet making their entrances and exits

One thing is lamentable the relation with Madame is not now a
flourishing one or capable again of being Does not love me as he did
the wretch thinks Madame alwaysyet sticks by him were it but in
the form of blister They had been to Luneville Spring 1747 happy
dull place within reach of Cirey far from Versailles and its cabals
They went again 1748 in a kind of permanent way Titular Stanislaus
an opulent dawdling creature much liking to have them and Father
Menou his Jesuitwho is always in quarrel with the Titular
Mistressthinking to displace HER as you gradually discover and
promote the Du Chatelet to that improper dignity In which he had not
the least success says Voltaire but got two women on his ears instead
of one It was not to be Stanislauss mistress nor a TITULAR one at
all but a real that Madame was fated in this dull happy place Idle
readers know the story only too wellconcerning which admit this
other Fraction and no more

Stanislaus as a Titular King cannot do without some kind of Titular
Armywere it only to blare about as Lifeguard and beat kettledrums
on occasion A certain tall highsniffing M de St Lambert a young
Lorrainer of long pedigree and light purse had just taken refuge in
this Lifeguard Summer 1748 or so I know not whether as Captain or
Lieutenant just come from the Netherlands Wars of grave stiff manners
for the rest a goodlooking young fellow thought to have some poetic
genius evenwho is precious surely in such an outoftheway
place Welcome to Voltaire to Madame still more Alas readers know the
Historyon which we must not dwell Madame a brown geometric Lady
age now fortytwo with a Great Man who has scandalously ceased to
love her casts her eye upon St Lambert Yes you would be the
shoeinghorn Monsieur if one had time you fine florid fellow hardly
yet into your thirties And tries him with a little coquetry I
always think perhaps in this view chiefly And then at any rate as he
responded the thing itself became so interesting Our Ulyssesbow
we can still bend it then aha And is not that a pretty stag withal
worth bringing down florid just entering his thirties and with the
susceptibilities of genius Voltaire was not blind could he have helped
ithad he been tremulously alive to help it Your Verses to her my

WARPASSAGES IN 1747

The War since Friedrich got out of it does not abate in animosity nor
want for bloodshed battle and sieging but offers little now memorable
March 18th 1747 a ghastly Phantasm of a Congress Congress of Breda
which had for some months been attempting Peace and was never able to
get into conference or sit in its chairs except for moments flew away
altogether In September 1746 had got together but would not take
life on trying and again trying and fell forgotten February 1747
again gleams up into hope March 18th and the following days vanishes
for good ADELUNG v 50 vi 6 62 and left the War perhaps angrier
than ever more hopelessly stupid than ever Except indeed that
resources are failing money running low in France Parlements beginning
to murmur and among the Population generally a feeling that glory is
excellent but will not make the national pot boil Perhaps all this
will be more effective than Congresses of Breda Here are the few Notes
worth giving

APRIL 23d30th 1747 THE FRENCH INVADE HOLLAND WHEREUPON SUDDENLY
A STADTHOLDER THERE After Fontenoy there has been much sieging and
capturing in that Netherlands Country a series of successes gloriously
delightful to Marechal de Saxe and the French Nation likewise in
bar of said sieging in futile attempt to bar it a Battle of Roucoux
October 1746 with victory or quasivictory to Saxe at least with
prostration to the opposite part

And farther on there is a Battle of Lauffeld coming 2d July 1747
with similar results frustration evident retreat evident victory not
much to speak of And in this gloriously delightful manner Saxe and the
French Nation have proceeded till in fact the Netherlands Territory
with all strongholds except Maestricht alone was theirsand they
decided on attacking the Dutch Republic itself And 17th April 1747
actually broke in upon the frontier Fortresses of Zealand found the
same dryrotten everywhere and took them Fortress after Fortress at
the rate of a cannon salvo each Ye magnanimous Dutch see what you
have got by not sitting still as recommended To the horror and terror
of the poor Zealanders and general Dutch Population Who shrieked to
England for helpand were on the very instant furnished with a
modicum of Seventyfours Dutch Courier returning by the same which
landed the Courier April 23d and put Walcheren in a state of security
Adelung vi 105 125134

Whereupon the Dutch Population turned round on its Governors with
a growl of indignation spreading ever wider waxing ever higher
Scandalous laggards is this your mode of governing a free Republic
Freedom to let the State go to dryrot and become the laughingstock
of mankind To provide for your own paltry kindred in the
Stateemployments to palaver grandly with all comers and publish
melodious Despatches of Van Hoey Had not Britannic Majesty for his

JULY 19th FATE OF CHEVALIER DE BELLEISLE At the Fortress of Exilles
in one of those Passes of the Savoy AlpsPass of Col di Sieta
memorable to the French Soldier ever sincethere occurred a lamentable
thing doubtless much talked of at Sceaux while Voltaire was there
The Revolt of Genoa popular outburst and expulsion of our poor friend
Botta and his Austrians then a famous thing and a rarer than now
having suddenly recalled the victorious General Browne from his Siege
of Antibes and Invasion of ProvenceMarechal Duc de Belleisle

steadfastly for Defence of Genoa against indignant Botta Browne and
Company For defence of Genoa nay for attack on Turin which would
have been defence in Genoa and everywherehad the captious Spaniard
consented to cooperate Captious Spaniard would not Couriers to
Madrid to Paris thereupon and much time losttill at the eleventh
hour came consent from Paris Try it by yourself then Belleisle
tries it at least his Brother does His Brother the Chevalier is to
force that Pass of Exilles a terrible fiery business but the backbone
of the whole adventure in which if the Chevalier can succeed he too
is to be Marechal de France Forward therefore climb the Alpine stairs
again snatch me that Fort of Exilles

And so July 19th 1747 the Chevalier comes in sight of the Place

Alps to right and left looking down on him and it Chevalier de

DECEMBER 25th RUSSIANS IN BEHALF OF HUMAN LIBERTY March of 36000
Russians from the City of Moscow this day on a very long journey in
the hoary Christmas weather Most Christian Majesty is ruinously short
of money Britannic Majesty has still credit and a voting Parliament
but owing to French influence on the Continent can get no recruits to
hire Gradually driven upon Russia in such stress Britannic Majesty
has this year hired for himself a 35000 Russians 30000 regular foot
4000 ditto horse and 1000 Cossacksuncommonly cheap only 150000
pounds the lot not 4 pounds per head by the year And in spite
of many difficulties and hagglings they actually get on march from
Moscow 25th December 1747 and creep on all Winter through the
frozen peats wildernesses through Lithuania Poland towards Bohmen
Mahren are to appear in the Rhine Countries joined by certain
Austrians and astonish mankind next Spring Their Captain is one
Repnin Prince Repnin afterwards famous enough in those Polish
Countrieswhich is now the one point interesting to us in the thing

Their Captain WAS first to be Lacy old Marshal Lacy then failing
Lacy Why not General Keithbut proves to be Repnin after much
hustling and intriguing Repnin not Keith that is the interesting
point

Such march of the Russians on behalf of Human Liberty in pay of
Britannic Majesty is a surprising fact and considerably discomposes
the French Who bestir themselves in Sweden and elsewhere against Russia
and it with no resultexcept perhaps the incidental one of getting
our esteemed old friend Guy Dickens now Sir Guy dismissed from
Stockholm and we hope put on halfpay on his return home Adelung

MARSHAL KEITH COMES TO PRUSSIA September 1747

Much hustling and intriguing it appears in regard to the Captaincy
of these Russians Concerning which there is no word worthy to be
saidexcept for one reason only That it finished off the connection
of General Keith with Russia That this of seeing Repnin his junior and
inferior preferred to him was of many disgusts the last drop which
made the cup run overand led the said General to fling it from him
and seek new fields of employment From Hamburg having got so far
he addresses himself 1st September 1747 to Friedrich with offer
of service who grasps eagerly at the offer Feldmarschall your rank
income 1200 a year income welcome all suitableand October
28th Feldmarschall Keith finishes at Potsdam a long Letter to his
Brother Lord Marischal in these words worth giving as those of a very
cleareyed sound observer of men and things

I have now the honor and which is still more the pleasure of being
with the King at Potsdam where he ordered me to come 17th current
two days after he declared me Fieldmarshal Where I have the honor to
dine and sup with him almost every day He has more wit than I have wit
to tell you speaks solidly and knowingly on all kinds of subjects and
I am much mistaken if with the experience of Four Campaigns he is
not the best Officer of his Army He has several persons Rothenburg
Winterfeld Swedish Rudenskjold just about departing not to speak of
DArgens and the French with whom he lives in almost the familiarity
of a friendbut has no favoriteand shows a natural politeness for
everybody who is about him For one who has been four days about his
person you will say I pretend to know a great deal of his character
but what I tell you you may depend upon With more time I shall know
as much of him as he will let me knowand all his Ministry knows

A notable acquisition to Friedrichand to the two Keiths withal for
Friedrich attached both of them to his Court and service after their
unlucky wanderings and took to them both in no common degree As will
abundantly appear

While that Russia Corps was marching out of Moscow Cocceji and his
Commissions report from Pommern that the Pomeranian Lawstables are
completely clear that the New Courts have for many months back been

perhaps for half an hour to the terror and horror of those about
him Hemiplegia he calls it rush of blood to the headprobably

Netherlandscoupled with this remarkable new clause And they are to
be there in fact and not on paper only and with a tareandtret of

valiant man knowing of War little more than the White Horse of Hanover

Holland is as good as his As for King Louis glory with funds running

France and him King Louiss wishes are known this long whileand

express word to that effect and outline of the modest terms proposed in
ones hour of victory with pot ceasing to boil

On a sudden too March 18thwintry blasts and hailstorms still

field stronger than ever Manoeuvred about bewildering the mind of
Royal Highness and the Stadtholder Will he besiege Breda Will he do

In a word those 35000 Russians are still far away under the horizon
when thoughts of a new Congress Congress of AixlaChapelle are
busying the public mind Mere moonshine again Something real this
timeAnd on and from March 17th Lord Sandwich first on the ground
and Robinson from Vienna coming to help the actual Congress begins
assembling there April 24th the Congress gets actually to business
very intent on doing it at least the three main parties France

days nothing but haggle and objection on the part of the others did

The Treaty of AixlaChapelle was done in a hurry and a huddle greatly
to Maria Theresas disgust Why not go on with your expenditures ye
SeaPowers Can money and life be spent better I have yet conquered
next to nothing for the Cause of Liberty and myself But the SeaPowers
were tired of it the Dutch especially who had been hoisted with such
difficulty tended strongly New Stadtholder notwithstanding to plump
down again into stable equilibrium on the broadbottom principle Huddle
up the matter end it well if you can any way end it The Treaty
contained many Articles now become forgettable to mankind There is
only One Article and the Want of One which shall concern us in this
place The One Article is guarantee by all the European Powers to
Friedrichs Treaty of Dresden Punctually got as bargained forFrench
especially willing Britannic Majesty perhaps a little languid but his
Ministers positive on the point so that Friedriohs Envoy had not much
difficulty at Aix And now Friedrichs Ownership of Silesia recognized
by all the Powers to be final and unquestionable surely nothing more is
wanted Nothingexcept keeping of this solemn stipulation by all the
Powers How it was kept by some of them in what sense some of them are
keeping it even now we shall see by and by

The Want of an Article was on the part of England concerning
JENKINSS EAR There is not the least conclusion arrived at on that
important SpanishEnglish Question blind beginning of all these
conflagrations and which in its meaning to the somnambulant Nation
is so immense No notice taken of it huddled together some hasty
shovelful or two of diplomatic ashes cast on it As good as extinct
you see Left smoking when all the rest is quenched Considerable
feeling there was on this point in the heart of the poor somnambulant
English Nation much dumb or semiarticulate growling on such a
PeaceTreaty We have arrived nowhere then by all this fighting and
squandering and perilous stumbling among the chimneypots Spain on
its own showing owed us 95000 pounds Spains debt to Hanover yes
you take care of that some old sixpenny matter which nobody ever heard
of before and of Spains huge debt to England you drop no hint of
the 95000 pounds clear money due by Spain or of ones liberty to
navigate the High Seas none PROTEST OF ENGLISH MERCHANTS AGAINST
c May 1748 given in ADELUNG vi 353358 A Peace the reverse of
applauded in England though the wiser Somnambulants much more Pitt
and Friends who are broad awake on these German points may well be
thankful to see such a War end on any termsWell surely this old
admitted 95000 pounds should have been paid And to a moral certainty
Robinson and Sandwich must have made demand of it from the Spaniard But
there is no getting old Debts in especially from that quarter King
Friedrich let me interrupt for a moment with this poor composite
Note is trying in Spain even nowever since 1746 when Termagants
Husband died and a new King camefor payment of old debt Two old
Debts quite tolerably just both of them King Friedrich keeps trying
till 1749 three years in all and in the end gets nothing whatever
Nothingexcept some Merino Rams in the interim gift from the new
King of Spain I can suppose which proved extremely useful in our Wool
Industries and from the same polite Ferdinand VI a Porcelain Vase
filled with Spanish Snuff That was all

King Friedrich let me note farther is getting decidedly deep into
snuff holds by SPANIOL a dry yellow pungency analogous to Lundyfoot
or IrishBlackguard known to snuffy readers always by Spaniol we
say and more especially the kind used by her Majesty of Spain the
now Dowager Termagant Orders this kind from his Ambassador in Paris

Preuss i 409NOTE FARTHER if interesting The Termagant still
lasted as Dowager consuming SPANIOL at least for near twenty years

not her son he went mad poor soul and died 10th August 1759 upon
which Carlos of Naples our own Baby Carlos that once was succeeded

did not die but had his difficulties till 1825 Don Philip who had
fought so in those Savoy Passes and got the bit of Parmesan Country
died 1765 the year before Mamma which also is to be remembered
Dryasdust adds in his sweetly consecutive way Friedrich was very
expensive about his snuffboxes wore two big rich boxes in his pockets
five or six stood on tables about and more than a hundred in store
coming out by turns for variety The cheapest of them cost 300 pounds
2000 thalers he had them as high as 1500 pounds At his death
there were found 130 of various values they were the substance of all
the jewelry he had besides these snuffboxes two gold watches only
and a very small modicum of rings Had yearly for personal Expenditure
1200000 thalers 180000 pounds of Civil List as we should say
SPENT 33000 pounds of it and yearly gave the rest away in Royal
beneficences aid of burnt Villages inundated Provinces and
multifarious PATERPATRIAE objects Preuss i 409 410In regard
to JENKINSS EAR my Constitutional Friend continues

SILESIA and JENKINSS EAR we often say were the two bits of realities
in this enormous hurlyburly of imaginations insane ambitions and
zeros and negative quantities Negative Belleisle goes home not with

The losses of men money and resource under this mad empty Enterprise

perhaps these were trifling to the replacement of them by such GLOIRE
as there had been A GLOIRE of plunging into War on no cause at all and
with an issue consisting only of foul gases of extreme levity Messieurs
are of confessed promptitude to fight and their talent for it in some
kinds is very great indeed But this treating of battle and slaughter
of death judgment and eternity as light playhouse matters this of
rising into such transcendency of valor as to snap your fingers in the
face of the Almighty Maker this Messieurs give me leave to say so is
a thing that will conduct you and your PREMIERE NATION to the Devil if
you do not alter it Inevitable I tell you Your road lies that way
then Good morning Messieurs let me still hope Not

Diplomatist Kaunitz gained his first glories in this Congress of Aix
which are still great in the eyes of some Age now thirtyseven a
native of these Western parts but henceforth by degrees ever more the
shining star and guide of Austrian Policies down almost to our own New
Epoch As unluckily he will concern us not a little in time coming
let us read this Note as foreshadow of the man and his doings

The glory of Count ultimately Prince von KaunitzRietberg is

MARECHAL DE SAXE PAYS FRIEDRICH A VISIT

In Summer 1749 Marechal de Saxe the other shiny figure of this mad
Business of the Netherlands paid Friedrich a visit had the honor to
be entertained by him three days July 13th16th 1749 in his Royal
Cottage of SansSouci seemingly in his choicest manner Curiosity
which is now nothing like so vivid as it then was would be glad to
listen a little in this meeting of two Suns or of one Sun and one
immense TarBarrel or Atmospheric Meteor really of shining nature
and taken for a Sun But the Books are silent not the least detail or
hint or feature granted us Only Fancyand this of Smelfungus by way
of long farewell to one of the parties

 It was at Tongres or in headquarters near it 10th October
1746Battle expected on the morrow Battle of ROUCOUX over towards
Herstal which we used to knowthat M Favart Saxes Playwright and
TheatreDirector gave out in cheerful doggerel on fall of the Curtain
the announcement

 Demain nous donnerons relache
 Quoique le Directeur sen fache
 Vous voir combleroit nos desirs

 Whose sole study is to keep you happy

 But you being bent upon victory
 What can he do
 Day after tomorrow

Day after tomorrow added he taking the official tone in honor of
your laurels gained already since you resolve on gaining them we
will have the honor of presentingsuch and such a gay Farce to as
many of you as remain alive which was received with gay clapping of
hands admirable to the Universe at least to the Parisian UNIVERS and
oneself Such a prodigality of light daring is in these French
gentlemen skilfully tickled by the Marechal who uses this Playwright
among other implements for keeping them at the proper pitch Was there
ever seen such radiancy of valor Very radiant indeedyet it seems to
me gone somewhat into the phosphorescent kind shining in the dark as
fish will do when rotten War has actually its serious character nor is
Death a farcical transaction however high your genius may go But what
then it is the Marechals trade to keep these poor people at the
cutting pitch on any terms that will hold for the moment

I know not which was the most dissolute Army ever seen in the world
but this of Saxes was very dissolute Playwright Favart had withal
a beautiful clever Wifeupon whom the courtships munificent
blandishments threatenings and utmost endeavors of Marechal de Saxe
in his character of goatfooted Satyr could not produce the least
impression For a whole year not the least Whereupon the Goatfooted
had to get LETTRE DE CACHET for her had toin fact produce the
brutalest Adventure that is known of him even in this brutal kind Poor
Favart rushing about in despair not permitted to run him through the
belly and die with his Wife undishonored had to console himself he
and she and do agreeable theatricalities for a living as heretofore
Let us not speak of it

Of Saxes Generalship which is now a thing fallen pretty much into
oblivion I have no authority to speak He had much wild natural
ingenuity in him cunning rapid whirls of contrivance and gained Three
Battles and very many Sieges amid the loudest clapping of hands that
could well be He had perfect intrepidity not to be flurried by any
amount of peril or confusion looked on that English Column advancing
at Fontenoy with its FUE INFERNAL steadily through his perspective
chewing his leaden bullet Going to beat me then Well Nobody
needed to be braver He had great goodnature too though of hot temper
and so full of multifarious veracities a substratum of inarticulate
good sense withal and much magnanimity run wild or run to seed A
biglimbed swashing perpendicular kind of fellow haughty of face
but jolly too with a big not ugly strutcaptivating to the French
Nation and fit God of War fitter than Dalhousie I am sure for
that susceptive People Understood their Army also what it was then
and there and how by theatricals and otherwise to get a great deal of
fire out of it Great deal of firewhether by gradual conflagration
or not on the road to ruin or not how he did not care In respect of
military fame so called he had the great advantage of fighting always
against bad Generals sometimes against the very worst To his fame an
advantage to himself and his real worth far the reverse Had he fallen
in with a Friedrich even with a Browne or a Traun there might have
been different news got Friedrich who was never stingy in such
matters except to his own Generals where it might do hurt is profuse
in his eulogies in his admirations of Saxe amiable to see and not
insincere but which perhaps practically do not mean very much

It is certain the French Army reaped no profit from its experience
of Marechal de Saxe and the high theatricalities ornamental
blackguardisms and ridicule of death and life In the longrun a graver
face would have been of better augury King Friedrichs soldiers one
observes on the eve of battle settle their bits of worldly business
and wind up many of them with a hoarse whisper of prayer Oliver
Cromwells soldiers did so Gustaf Adolfs in fact I think all
good soldiers Roucoux with a Prince Karl Lauffeld with a Duke of
Cumberland you gain your Roucoux your Lauffeld Human Stupidity
permitting but one day you fall in with Human Intelligence in an
extremely grave formand your ELAN elastic outburst the quickest
in Nature what becomes of it Wait but another decade we shall
see what an Army this has grown Cupidity dishonesty floundering
stupidity indiscipline mistrust and an elastic outspurt ELAN turned
often enough into the form of SAUVEQUIPEUT

M le Marechal survived AixlaChapelle little more than two years
Lived at Chambord on the Loire an ExRoyal Palace in such splendor as
never was Went down in a rosepink cloud as if of perfect felicity of
glory that would last foreverwhich it has by no means done He made
despatch escaped in this world the Nemesis which often waits on what
they call fame By diligent service of the Devil in ways not worth
specifying he saw himself November 21st 1750 flung prostrate
suddenly Putrid fever gloom the doctors ominously to one another
and November 30th the Devil I am afraid it was he though clad in
roseate effulgence and melodious exceedingly carried him home on those
kind terms as from a Universe all of Opera Wait till 1759till

she would have some iced barleywater drank a big glass of itand
some instants after had great pain in her head followed by other bad
symptoms Which brought the Doctor in again several Doctors hastily
summoned who after difficulties thought again that all was coming
right And so on the sixth night 10th September inquiring friends had
left the sickroom hopefully and gone down to supper the rather as
Madame seemed inclined to sleep There remained none with her but M de
St Lambert one of her maids and I M de St Lambert as soon as the
strangers were gone went forward and spoke some moments to her but
seeing her sleepy drew back and sat chatting with us two Eight or ten
minutes after we heard a kind of rattle in the throat intermixed with
hiccoughs we ran to the bed found her senseless raised her to a
sitting posture tried vinaigrettes rubbed her feet knocked into the
palms of her handsall in vain she was dead

Of course the supperparty burst up into her room M le Marquis de
Chatelet M de Voltaire and the others Profound consternation to
tears to cries succeeded a mournful silence Voltaire and St Lambert
remained the last about her bed At length Voltaire quitted the room
got out by the Grand Entrance hardly knowing which way he went At the
foot of the Outer Stairs near a sentrys box he fell full length on
the pavement His lackey who was a step or two behind rushed forward
to raise him At that moment came M de St Lambert who had taken the
same road and who now hastened to help M de Voltaire once on his
feet again and recognizing who it was said through his tears and with
the most pathetic accent AH MON AMI it is you that have killed
her to meand then suddenly as if starting awake with the tone of
reproach and despair EH MON DIEU MONSIEUR DE QUOI VOUS AVISIEZVOUS

Poor M de Voltaire suddenly become widower and flung out upon his
shifts again at his time of life May now wander Ishmaellike whither
he will in this hard lonesome world His grief is overwhelming mixed
with other sharp feelings clue on the matter but does not last very
long in that poignant form He will turn up on us in his new capacity
of singleman again brilliant enough within year and day

Last Autumn September 1748 Wilhelminas one Daughter one child was
wedded to that young Durchlaucht of Wurtemberg whom we saw gallanting
the little girl to Wilhelminas amusement some years ago About the
wedding nothing nor about the wedded life what would have been more
curiousno Wilhelmina now to tell us anything not even whether Mamma

King too busy I suppose with Silesian Reviews and the like sends
his best wishesfor indeed the Match was of his sanctioning and

or favor anywhere by means of this Durchlaucht in the end far
the reverseIn a word the happy couple rolled away to Wurtemberg
September 26th 1748 he twenty she sixteen poor young creatures
and in years following became unhappy to a degree

There was but one child and it soon died The young Serene Lady was
of airy high spirit graceful clever good too they said perhaps a
thought too proudbut as for her Reigning Duke there was seldom seen
so lurid a Serenity and it was difficult to live beside him A most
arbitrary Herr with glooms and whims dimeyed ambitious voracious
and the temper of an angry mulevery fit to have been haltered in a
judicious manner instead of being set to halter others Enough in
six or seven years time the bright Pair found itself grown thunderous
opaque beyond description and in 1759 had to split asunder for good

Chapter IV COCCEJI FINISHES THE LAWREFORM FRIEDRICH IS PRINTING HIS
POESIES

In these years Friedrich goes on victoriously with his LawReform
Herculean Cocceji with Assistants backed by Friedrich beneficently
conquering Province after Province to himKurMark NeuMark
Cleve all easy in comparison after Pommern and finally Preussen
itselfto the joy and profit of the same Coccejis method so far
as the Foreign onlooker can discern across much haze seems to be
threefold

1 Extirpation painless were it possible of the Pettifogger Species
indeed of the Attorney Species altogether Seek other employments
disappear all of you from these precincts under penalty The
Advocate himself takes charge of the suit from first birth of it and
sees it endedhe knows within what limit of time

2 Sifting out of all incompetent Advocates Follow that
AttorneyCompany you awaysifting out all these and retaining in
each Court with fees accurately settled with character stamped sound
or at least SOUNDEST the number actually needed In a milder way but
still more strictly Judges stupid or otherwise incompetent are riddled
out able Judges appointed and their salaries raised

3 What seems to be Friedrichs own invention what in outcome he thinks
will be the summary of all good LawProcedure A final Sentence three
instances you can have but the third ends it for you within the
Year Good surely A justice that intends to be exact must front the
complicacies in a resolute piercing manner and will not be tedious Nay
a justice that is not moderately swifthuman hearts waiting for it
the while in a cancerous state instead of hopefully following their
workwhat comparatively is the use of its being never so exact

Simple enough methods rough and ready Needing in the execution clear
human eyesight clear human honestywhich happen to be present here
and without which no method whatever can be executed that will really
profit

In the course of 1748 Friedrich judging by Pommern and the other
symptoms that his enterprise was safe struck a victorious Medal upon
it FRIDERICUS BORUSSORUM REX pressing with his sceptre the oblique
Balance to a level posture with Epigraph EMENDATO JURE Letter
to Cocceji accompanying Copy of the Medal in Gold 24th June 1748
Seyfarth ii 67 n And by Newyears day 1750 the matter was in
effect completed and justice cheap expeditious certain a fact in
all Prussian Lands

Nay in 17491751 to complete the matter Coccejis Project of a
general LawCode PROJEKT DES CORPORIS JURIS FRIDERICIANI came forth
in print Halle 2 vols folio Preuss i 316 see IB 315 n as to
the LAWPROCEDURE c now settled by Cocceji to the admiration of
mankind at home and abroad the First Code attempted since Justinians
time say they PROJECT translated into all languages and read in all
countries A poor mildewed copy of this CODEX FRIDERICIANUSdone at
Edinburgh 1761 not said by whom evidently bought at least TWICE and
mostly never yet read nor like being readis known to me for years
past in a ghastly manner Without the least profit to this present or
to any other Enterprisethough persons of name in Jurisprudence call
it meritorious in their Science the first real attempt at a Code in
Modern times But the truth is this Cocceji CODEX remained a PROJECT
merely never enacted anywhere It was not till 1773 that Friedrich
made actual attempt to build a LawCode and did build one the
foundationstory of one for his share completed since in which this
of Cocceji had little part In 1773 the thing must again be mentioned
the Second LawReform as they call it What we practically know from
this time is That Prussian Lawsuits through Friedrichs Reign do all
terminate or push at their utmost for terminating within one year from
birth and that Friedrichs fame as a beneficent Justinian rose
high in all Countries strange in Countries that had thought him
a Warscourge and Conquering Hero strange but undeniable
SeeGentlemans Magazinexx 215218 May 1750 eloquent
enthusiastic LETTER given there of Baron de Spon to Chancellor
DAguessan on these inimitable Law Achievements and that his own
People if more silently yet in practice very gladly indeed welcomed
his LawReform and from day to day enjoyed the sameno doubt with
occasional remembrance who the Donor was

Of Friedrichs Literary works nobody not even Friedrich himself will
think it necessary that we say much But the fact is he is doing a
great many things that way in Prose the MEMOIRS OF BRANDENBURG coming
out as Papers in the Academy from time to time From 1746 and onward
first published complete after slight revision by Voltaire Berlin
1751 in Verse very secret as yet the PALLADION exquisite
Burlesque think some the ART OF WAR reckoned truly his best Piece
in verseand wishes sometimes he had Voltaire here to perfect him
a little This too would be one of the practical charms of Voltaire
Friedrichs Letter to Algarotti OEuvresxviii 66 12th
September 1749 For though King Friedrich knows and remembers always
that these things especially the Verse part are mere amusements in
comparison he has the creditable wish to do these well one would
not fantasy ILL even on the Flute if one could help it Why does nt
Voltaire come as Quantz of the Flute has done Friedrich now that
Voltaire has fallen widower renews his pressings Why dont you come
Patience your Majesty Voltaire will come

Nobody can wish details in this Department but there is one thing
necessary to be mentioned That Friedrich in these years 17491752
has Printers out at Potsdam and is Printing in beautiful quarto
form with copperplates to the extent of twelve copies the OEUVRES
Poetical that is DU PHILOSOPHE DE SANSSOUCI Only twelve copies
I have heard gift of a single copy indicating that you are among the
choicest of the chosen Copies have now fallen extremely rare and are
not in request at all with my readers or me but there was one Copy
which or the Mistitle of which as OEUVRE DE POESHIE DU ROI MON
MAITRE became miraculously famous in a year or twoand is still
memorable to us all On Voltaires arrival we shall hear more of these
things Enough to say at present that the OEUVRES DU PHILOSOPHE DE
SANSSOUCI AU DONJON DU CHATEAU AVEC PRIVILEGE DAPOLLONthree
thinnish quarto volumes all the Poetry then on handwas finished
early in 1750 before Voltaire came That when Voltaire came a revisal
was undertaken a new Edition with Voltaires corrections and other
changes total suppression of the PALLADION for one creditable
change that this Edition was to have been in Two Volumes that One
accordingly rather thicker than the former sort was got finished in
1752 same TITLE only the new Date and no DONJON DU CHATEAU this
time One Volume in 1752 after which owing to the explosions that
ensued no Second came nor ever willand that the actual contents of
that farfamed OEUVRE DE POESHIE number of volumes even are points
of mystery to me at this day Herr Preussin the CHRONOLOGICAL LIST
of Friedrichs Writings a useful accurate Piece otherwise and in two
other places where he triesis very indistinct on this of DONJON DU
CHATEAU and it is all but impossible to ascertain from him WHAT in an
indisputable manner the OEUVRE DE POESHIE may have been Here are
the places for groping if another should be induced to tryOEuvres
de Fredericx Preface p ix IB xi Preface p ix IBTable
Chhronologiquein what Volume this is you cannot yet say seems
preliminary to a GENERAL INDEX which is infinitely wanted but has not
yet appeared to this Editors aid p 14

Friedrichs other employments are multifarious as those of a Lands
Husband not inferior to his Father in that respect and like the
benefits of the diurnal Sun are to be considered incessant innumerable
and in result to usward SILENT also impossible to speak of in this
place From the highest pitch of Statecraft Russian Czarina now fallen
plainly hostile and needing lynxeyed diplomacy ever and anon down
to that of Dredging and Fascinework as at Stettin and elsewhere of
Odercanals of Soapboiler Companies and MulberryandSilk Companies

The Review seasons I notice go somewhat as follows For Berlin and
neighborhood May or perhaps end of April weather now bright and
ground firm sometimes with considerable pomp both Queens out and
beautiful Female Nobilities in twentyfour green tents and often
with great complicacy of manoeuvre In June to Magdeburg round by
Cleve and home again for some days July is Pommern Onward thence to
Schlesien oftenest in August Schlesien the last place and generally
not done with till well on in September But we will speak of these
things more specially another time Such Reviews for strictness of

Chapter V STRANGERS OF NOTE COME TO BERLIN IN 1750

British Diplomacies next to the Russian cause some difficulties
in those years of which more by and by Early in 1748 while
AixlaChapelle was starting ExExchequer Legge came to Berlin on some
obscure object of a small Patch of Principality hanging loose during
those Negotiations Could not we secure it for his Royal Highness
of Cumberland thinks your Majesty ExExchequer Legge was here
CoxesPelhami 431 c Rodenbeck pp 155 160 first audience
1st May 1748recalled 22d November Aix being over got handsome
assurances of a general nature but no furtherance towards his obscure
completely impracticable object and went home in November following to
a new Parliamentary Career

And the second year after early in 1750 came Sir Hanbury Williams
famed London Wit of Walpoles circle on objects which in the main
were equally chimerical King of the Romans much wanted No Damage
to your Majestys Shipping from our British Privateers and the
likeabout which some notice and not very much will be due
farther on Here in his own words is Hanburys Account of his First
Audience

 On Thursday 16th July 1750 I went to Court by appointment at
11 AM The King of Prussia arrived about 12 at Berlin King in from
Potsdam for one day and Count Podewils immediately introduced me into
the Royal closet when I delivered his Britannic Majestys Letters into
the King of Prussias hands and made the usual compliments to him in
the best manner I was able To which his Prussian Majesty replied to
the best of my remembrance as followsI have the truest esteem
for the King of Britains person and I set the highest value on his
friendship I have at different times received essential proofs of it
and I desire you would acquaint the King your Master that I will SIC
never forget them His Prussian Majesty afterwards said something with
respect to myself and then asked me several questions about indifferent
things and persons He seemed to express a great deal of esteem for
my Lord Chesterfield and a great deal of kindness for Mr Villiers
useful in the PeaceofDresden time but did not once mention Lord
Hyndford or Mr Leggehow singular

I was in the closet with his Majesty exactly five minutes and a half
My audience done Prussian Majesty came out into the general room where
Foreign Ministers were waiting He said on stepping in just one word
to the Austrian Excellency not even one to the Russian Excellency
nor to me the Britannic conversed with the French Swedish
Danishhappy to be off which I do not wonder at to dine with Mamma
at Monbijou among faces pleasant to him and return to his Businesses
and Books next day WalpoleGeorge the Secondi 449 Rodenbeck i

Witty Excellency Hanbury did not succeed at Berlin on the RomishKing
Question or otherwise and indeed went off rather in a hurry But for
the next six or seven years he puddles about at a great rate in those
Northern Courts giving away a great deal of money hatching many futile
expensive intrigues at Petersburg Warsaw not much at Berlin after the
first trial there and will not be altogether avoidable to us in time
coming as one could have wished Besides he is Horace Walpoles friend
and select London Wit he contributed a good deal to the English notions
about Friedrich and has left considerable bits of acrid testimony on
Friedrich clear words of an Eyewitness men call themwhich are
still read by everybody the said Walpole and others having since
printed them in very dark condition In WalpoleGeorge the
Secondi 448461 the Pieces which regard Friedrich InSir Charles
Hanbury Williamss Worksedited by a diligent reverential but
ignorant gentleman whom I could guess to be Bookseller Jeffery
in person London 1822 3 vols small 8vo are witty Verses and
considerable sections of Prose relating to other persons and objects
now rather of an obsolete nature Brevity is much due to Hanbury and
his testimonies since silence in the circumstances is not allowable
Here is one Excerpt with the necessary light for reading it

 It is on this RomishKing and other the like chimerical errands
that witty Hanbury then a much more admirable man than we now find him
is prowling about in the German Courts off and on for some ten
years in all six of them still to come A sharpeyed man of shrewish
quality given to intriguing to spying to bribing anxious to win his
Diplomatic game by every method though the stake as here is oftenest
zero with fatal proclivity to Scandal and what in London circles he
has heard called Wit Little or nothing of real laughter in the soul
of him at any time only a labored continual grin always of malicious
nature and much trouble and jerking about to keep that up Had
evidently some modicum of real intellect of capacity for being wise
but now has fatally devoted it nearly all to being witty on those
poor terms A perverse barren spiteful little wretch the grin of him
generally an affliction at this date His Diplomatic Correspondence I
do not know Nothing of him is discoverable in the StatePaper
Office Many of his Papers it would seem are in the Earl of Essexs
handsand might be of some Historical use not of very much could the
British Museum get possession of them Abundance of BACKSTAIRS
History on those Northern Courts especially on Petersburg and
WarsawDresdenauthentic Courtgossip generally malicious often
not true but never mendacious on the part of Williamsis one likely
item He did a great deal of Diplomatic business issuing in zero of
which I have sometimes longed to know the exact dates seldom anything
farther His History of Poland transmitted to the Right Hon
Henry Fox by instalments from Dresden in 1748 is SeeHanburys
Worksvol iiiWell I should be obliged to call it worthier of
Goody TwoShoes than of that Right Hon Henry who was a man of parts
but evidently quite a vacuum on the Polish side

Of Hanburys NewsLetters from Foreign Courts four or five
incidentally printed are like the contents of a sloppail
uncomfortable to the delicate mind Not lies on the part of Hanbury
but foolish scandal poured into him a man more filled with credulous
incredible scandal evil rumors of malfeasances by kings and magnates
than most people known His rumored mysteries between poor Polish
Majesty and pretty Daughterinlaw the latter a clever and graceful
creature Daughter of the late unfortunate Kaiser and a distinguished
Correspondent of Friedrichs are to be regarded as mere poisoned wind
SeeHanburys Worksii 209240 That Polish Majesty gets into his
dressinggown at two in the afternoon inaccessible thenceforth poor
lazy creature one most readily believes but there or pretty much
there ones belief has to stop The stories in WALPOLE on the King of
Prussia have a grain of fact in them twisted into huge irrecognizable
caricature in the Williams opticmachinery Much else one can discern
to be in essence false altogether Friedrich who could not stand that
intriguing spying shrewish unfriendly kind of fellow at his Court
applied to England in not many months hence and got Williams sent away
22d January 1751 MS LIST in StatePaper Office on to Russia or
I forget whitherwhich did not mend the Hanbury opticalmachinery on
that side The dull tobaccosmoking SaxonPolish Majesty about whom he
idly retails so many scandals had never done him any offence

On the whole if anybody wanted a swim in the sloppails of that extinct
generation Hanbury could he find an Editor to make him legible might
be printed For he really was deep in that sloppail or extinctscandal
department and had heard a great many things Apart from that in
almost any other departmentexcept in so far as he seems to DATE
rather carefullyI could not recommend him The Letters and Excerpts
given in Walpole are definable as one pennyworth of breadmuch ruined
by such immersion but very harmless otherwise could you pick it
out and clean itto twenty gallons of Hanbury sherrissack or
chamberslop I have found nothing that seems to be in all points
true or probable but this worth cutting out and rendering legible on
other accounts Hanbury LOQUITUR in condensed form

In the summer of last year 1749 there was somewhere in Mahren a
great Austrian Muster or Review all the more interesting as it was
believed or known that the Prussian methods and manoeuvres were now to
be the rule for Austria Not much of a Review otherwise this of 1749
EmpressQueen and Husband not personally there as in coming Years they
are wont to be that high Lady being ardent to reform her Army root and
branch according to the Prussian modelmore praise to her Maria
Theresiens Lebenp 160 what she did that way ANNO 1749 p 162
PRESENT at the Reviews ANNO 1750 At this Muster in Mahren Three
Prussian Officers happened to make their appearancefor several
imaginable reasons of little significance For the purpose of
inveigling people to desert and enlist with them said the Austrian
Authorities and ordered the Three Prussian Officers unceremoniously off
the ground Which Friedrich when he heard of it thought an unhandsome
pipeclay procedure and kept in mind against the Austrian Authorities

Next Summer next Spring 1750 an Austrian Captain being in
Mecklenburg travelling about met there an old acquaintance one
Chapeau HAT can it be possible who is in great favor with the King
of Prussiavery well Excellency Hanbury but who in the name of
wonder can this HAT or Chapeau have been After study one perceives
that Hanbury wrote Chazeau meaning CHASOT an old acquaintance of our
own Brilliant sabring melodying Chasot LieutenantColonel of the
Baireuth Dragoons who lies at Treptow close on Mecklenburg and is
a declared favorite of the Duchess often running over to the RESIDENZ
there Often enough but HONI SOIT O reader the clever Lady is towards
sixty childless musical and her Husbanddo readers recollect him at
allis that collapsed TAILORING Duke whom Friedrich once visitedand
whose Niece HalfNiece is Charlotte wise little hardfavored creature
now of six in clean bib and tucker Ancestress of England that is to
be whose Papa will succeed if the Serene Tailor die firstwhich he
did not quite To this Duchess musical gallant Chasot may well be a
resource and she to him Naturally the Austrian Captain having come
to Mecklenburg dined with Serene Highness he and Chasot together with
concert following and what not at the Schloss of NeuStrelitzAnd
now we will drop the Chapeau and say Chasot with comfort and a
shade of new interest

The grand May Review at Berlin just ahead wont you look in it is
straight on your road home suggests Chasot to his travelling friend
One would like it of all things answered the other but the King
Tush said Chasot I will make that all straight And applies to
the King accordingly Permission to an Austrian Officer a good
acquaintance of mine Austrian Officer Friedrichs eyes lighten and
he readily gives the permission This was at Berlin on the very eve
of the Review and Chasot and his Austrian are made happy in that small
matter And on the morrow end of May 1750 the Austrian attends
accordingly but to his astonishment has hardly begun to taste the
manoeuvres whenone of Friedrichs AidesdeCamp gallops up By the
Kings command Mein Herr you retire on the instant

Next day the Austrian is for challenging Chasot As you like that
way answers Chasot but learn first that on your affront I rode
up to the King and asked publicly Did not your Majesty grant me
permission Unquestionably Monsieur Chasotand if he had not come
how could I have paid back the Moravian business of last year
WalpoleGeorge the Secondi 457 459This is much in
Friedrichs way not the unwelcomer that it includes a satirical twitch
on Chasot whom he truly likes withal or did like though now a
little dissatisfied with those too frequent Mecklenburg excursions and
extramilitary cares Of this merely squeezing the Hanbury venom out of
it I can believe every particular

Did you ever hear of anything so shocking is Hanburys meaning here
and elsewhere I must tell you a story of the King of Prussias regard
for the Law of Nations continues he to Walpole Ib i 458 Which
proves to be a story turned topsyturvy of one Hofmann Brunswick
Envoy who quite BEYOND commission and a thing that must not be
thought of at all had been detected in dangerous intriguings with the
everbusy Russian Excellency or another and got flung into Spandau
Adelung v 534 vii 132144seemingly pretty much his due in the
matter And so of other Hanbury things What a Prussia for rigor of
command one huge prison in a manner King intent on punctuality and
all his business upon the square Society official and unofficial
kept rather strictly to their tackle their mode of movement not that
of loose oxen at all Such a detestable Tyrantwho has ordered ME
Hanbury elsewhither with my exquisite talents and admired wit




CANDIDATUS LINSENBARTH QUASI Lentilbeard LIKEWISE VISITS BERLIN

By far the notablest arrival in Berlin is M de Voltaires July 10th a
few days before Hanbury got his First Audience five minutes long But
that arrival will require a Chapter to itselfmost important arrival
that of all The least important again is probably that of Candidatus
Linsenbarth in these same weeksa rugged povertystricken
old Licentiate of Theology important to no mortal in Berlin or
elsewhereupon whom however and upon his procedures in that City we
propose for our own objects to bestow a few glances rugged Narrative
of the thing in singular exotic dialect but true every word
having fortunately come to us from Linsenbarths own hand Through
RodenbeckBeitragei 463 et seq

Berlin it must be admitted after all ones reading in poor Dryasdust
remains a dim empty object Teutschland is dim and empty and out of
the forty blind sacks or out of four hundred such what picture can
any human head form to itself of Friedrich as King or Man A trifling
Adventure of that poor individual called Linsenbarth CANDIDATUS
THEOLOGIAE one of the poorest of mortals but true and credible in
every particular comes gliding by chance athwart all that and like the
glimmer of a poor rushlight or kindled straw shows it us for moments
a thing visible palpable as it worked and lived In the great dearth
Linsenbarth if I can faithfully interpret him for the modern reader
will be worth attending to

Date of Linsenbarths Adventure is JuneAugust 1750 Schloss of
Beichlingen and Village of Hemmleben are in the Thuringen Hill
Country Weimar not far off to eastward the Hero himself a tall
awkward rawboned creature is for perhaps near forty years past a
CANDIDATUS say Licentiate or Curate without Cure Subsists I should
guess by schoolmasteringcheapest schoolmaster conceivable wages mere
nothingin the Villages about in the Village of Hemmleben latterly
age as I discover grown to be sixtyone in those straitened but by
no means forlorn circumstances And so here is veteran Linsenbarth of
Hemmleben a kind of Thuringian Dominie Sampson whose Interview with
such a brother mortal as Friedrich King of Prussia may be worth looking
atif I can abridge it properly

Well it appears in the year 1750 at this thriceobscure Village of
Hemmleben the worthy old pastor Cannabich diedworthy old man how
he had lived there modestly studious frugal chiefly on
farmproduce with tobacco and Dutch theology a modest blessing to
his fellowcreatures And now he is dead and the place vacant
Twenty pounds a Year certain let us guess it twenty with glebeland
piggeries poultryhutches who is now to get all that Linsenbarth
starts with his Narrative in earnest

Linsenbarth who I guess may have been Assistant to the deceased
Cannabich and was now out of work says I had not the least thought
of profiting by this vacancy but what happened The Herr Graf von
Werthern at Schloss Beichlingen sent his Steward LEHNSDIRECTOR
FIEFDIRECTOR is the title of this Steward which gives rise to
obsolete thought of milldues roadlabor payments IN NATURA his
Lehnsdirector Herr Kettenbeil over to my LOGIS cheap boarding
quarters who brought a gracious salutation from his Lord saying
farther That I knew too well excellent Cannabich gone from us
alas the Pastorate of Hemmleben was vacant that there had various
competitors announced themselves SUPPLICANDO for the place the Herr
Graf however had yet given none of them the FIAT but waited always
till I should apply As I had not done so he the Lord Graf would
now of his own motion give me the preference and hereby confer the
Pastorate upon me

Without all controversy here was a VOCATIO DIVINA to be received with
the most submissive thanks But the lame second messenger came hitching
in HALTING MESSENGER German proverb very soon Kettenbeil began
again He must mention to me SUB ROSA Her Ladyship the Frau Grafin
wanted to have her Ladysmaid provided for by this promotion too I
must marry her and take the living at the same time

Whew And this is the noble Ladys way of thinking up in her fine
Schloss yonder Linsenbarth will none of it For my notion fell at
once says he when I heard it was DO UT FACIAS FACIO UT FACIAS I
give that thou mayest do I do that thou mayest do Wilt have the kirk
then take the irk WILLST DU DIE PFARRE SO NIMM DIE QUARRE on those
terms my reply was Most respectful thanks Herr Fiefjudge and No
for such a vocation And why The vocation must have LIBERTATEM there
must be no VITIUM ESSENTIALE in it it must be right IN ESSENTIALI
otherwise no honest man can accept it with a good conscience This were
a marriage on constraint out of which a thousand INCONVENIENTIAE might
spring Hear Linsenbarth in the piebald dialect with the sound
heart and preference of starvation itself to some other things
Kettenbeil CHAINAXE went home and there was found another Candidatus
willing for the marriage on constraint out of which INCONVENIENTIAE
might spring in Linsenbarths opinion

And so did the sneakish courtly gentleman HOFMANN courtier as
Linsenbarth has it who grasped with both hands at my rejected offer
experience before long continues Linsenbarth For the loose thing of
courttatters led him such a life that within three years age yet only
thirty he had to bite the dust BITE AT THE GRASS says Linsenbarth
proverbially which was an INCONVENIENTIA including all others And I
had LEGITIMAM CAUSAM to refuse the vocation CUM TALI CONDITIONE

However it was very ill taken of me All over that Thuringian region
I was cried out upon as a headstrong foolish person The Herr Graf von
Werthern so ran the story had of his own kindness without request of
mine offered me a living RARA AVIS singular instance and I rash and
without head flung away such gracious offer In short I was told to
my face by goodnatured friends Nobody would ever think of me for
promotion againuniversal suffrage giving it clear against poor
Linsenbarth in this way

To get out of peoples sight at least continues he I decided to
leave my native place and go to Berlin 250 miles away or more And
so it was that on June the 20th 1750 I landed at Berlin for the
first time and here straightway at the PACKHOF or Customhouse in
searching of my things 400 THALERS some 60 pounds all in Nurnberg
BATZEN were seized from meBATZEN quartergroats we may say 7
and a half batzen go to a shilling what a sack there must have been
of them 9000 in all about the size of herringscales in bad silver
fruit of Linsenbarths stern thrift from birth upwardsall snatched
from him at one swoop And why says he quite historically Yes
Why The reader to understand it wholly would need to read
in MyliussEdictenSammlungin SEYFARTH and elsewhere
MyliusEdictxli January 1744 c c and to know the
scandalous condition of German coinage at this time and long after
every needy little Potentate mixing his coin with copper at discretion
and swindling mankind with it for a season needing to be peremptorily
forbidden confiscated or ordered home by the like of Friedrich
Linsenbarth answers his own And why with historical calmness

The king had some six years ago had the batzen utterly cried down
GANZ UND GAR they were not to circulate at all in his Countries
and I was so bold I had brought batzen hither into the Kings Capital
KONIGLICHE RESIDENZ itself At the Packhof there was but one answer
Contraband ContrabandHere was a welcome for a man I made my
excuses Did not the least know came straight from Thuringen many
miles of road could not guess there What His Majesty the King had been
pleased to forbid in His THEIRO Countries You should have
informed yourself said the Packhof people and were deaf to such
considerations A man coming into such a Residenz Town as Berlin with
intent to abide there should have inquired a little what was what
especially what coins were cried down and what allowed said they of
the Packhof Poor LinsenbarthBut what am I to do now How am I to
live if you take my very money from me That is your outlook
said theyand added He must even find stowage for his stack of
herringscales or batzen as soon as it was sealed up we have no room
for it in the Packhof for a man Here is a roughish welcome I must
leave all my money here and find stowage for it in a day or two

There was accordingly a truckporter called in he loaded my effects
on his barrow and rolled away He brought me to the WHITE SWAN in the
JUDENSTRASSE none of the grandest of streets that Berlin JEWRY threw
my things out and demanded four groschen Two of my batzen 2 and a
half exact would have done but I had no money at all The landlord
came out seeing that I had a stuffed featherbed note the luggage of
Linsenbarth FEDERBETT of extreme tenuity a trunk full of linens
a bag of Books and other trifles he paid the man and sent me to a
small room in the courtyard Inn forms a Court perhaps four stories
high I could stay there he said he would give me food and drink
in the meanwhile And so I lived in this Inn eight weeks long without
one red farthing in mere fear and anxiety June 20th PLUS eight weeks
brings us to August 15th Voltaire in HEIGHT of feather and very great
things just ahead Grand Carrousel 25th August cof which soon

The White Swan was a place where Carriers lodged some limb of the Law
of Subaltern sort whom Linsenbarth calls DER ADVOCAT B one of the
Ousted of Cocceji shall we fancy had to do with Carriers and their
piepowder lawsuits Advocat B had noticed the gray dreary CANDIDATUS
sitting sparrowlike in remote corners had spoken to himundertook
for a LOUIS DOR no purchase no pay to get back his batzen for
him They went accordingly one morning to a grand House it was
a Ministers name not given very grand Official Man he heard the
Advocat Bs short statement and made answer Monsieur and is it
you that will pick holes in the Kings Law I have understood you were
rather aiming at the HAUSVOGTEI Common Jail of Berlin Go on in that
way and you are sure of your promotionAdvocat B rushed out with
Linsenbarth into the street and there was neither pay nor purchase in
that quarter

Poor Linsenbarth was next advised by simple neighbors to go direct to
the King as every poor man can at certain hours of the day Write out
your Case Memorial with extreme brevity said they nothing but
the essential points and those clear Linsenbarth steam at the
highpressure composed CONZIPIRTE a Memorial of that right laconic
sort wrote it fair MUNDIRTE ESand went off therewith at opening
of the Gates middle time of August 1750 no date farther August
21st See Rodenbeck DIARY which we often quote i 205without
one farthing in my pocket in Gods name to Potsdam He continues

And at Potsdam I was lucky enough to see the King my first sight of
him He was on the Palace Esplanade there drilling his troops fine
trim sanded Expanse with the Palace to rear and Gardenwalks and River
to front where Friedrich Wilhelm sat the last day he was out and
ordered Jockey Philipss house to be actually set about where the
troops do evolutions every morningthere is Friedrich with cockedhat
and blue coat say about 11 AM

When the drill was over his Majesty went into the Garden and the
soldiers dispersed only four Officers remained lounging upon the
Esplanade and walked up and down For fright I knew not what to do
I pulled the Papers out of my pocketthese were my Memorial two
Certificates of character and a Thuringen Pass poor soul The
Officers noticed this came straight to me and said What letters has
He there then I thankfully and gladly imparted the whole and when
the Officers had read them they said We will give you Him not even
THEE a good advice The King is extragracious today and is gone
alone into the Garden Follow him straight Thou wilt have luck

This I would not do my awe was too great They thereupon laid hands
on me the mischievous dogs not illhumored either one took me by the
right arm another by the left Off off to the Garden Having got
me thither they looked out for the King He was among the gardeners
examining some rare plant stooping over it and had his back to us
Here I had to halt and the Officers began in underhand tone the
dogs to put me through my drill Hat under left armRight foot
foremostBreast well forwardHead upPapers from pouchPapers
aloft in right handSteady SteadyAnd went their ways looking
always round to see if I kept my posture I perceived well enough they
were pleased to make game of me but I stood all the same like a wall
being full of fear The Officers were hardly out of the Garden when
the King turned round and saw this extraordinary machinetelegraph
figure or whatever we may call it with papers pointing to the sky He
gave such a look at me like a flash of sunbeams glancing through you
and sent one of the gardeners to bring my papers Which having got he
struck into another walk with them and was out of sight In few minutes
he appeared again at the place where the rare plant was with my Papers
open in his left hand and gave me a wave with them To come nearer I
plucked up a heart and went straight towards him Oh how thrice and
fourtimes graciously this great Monarch deigned to speak to me

KING My good Thuringian LIEBER THURINGER you came to Berlin
seeking to earn your bread by industrious teaching of children and
here at the Packhof in searching your things they have taken your
Thuringen hoard from you True the batzen are not legal here but the
people should have said to you You are a stranger and did nt know the
prohibitionwell then we will seal up the Bag of Batzen you send it
back to Thuringen get it changed for other sorts we will not take it
from you

Be of heart however you shall have your money again and interest
tooBut my poor man Berlin pavement is bare they dont give
anything gratis you are a stranger before you are known and get
teaching your bit of money is done what then

I understood the speech right well but my awe was too great to say
Your Majesty will have the allhighest grace to allow me something
But as I was so simple and asked for nothing he did not offer anything
And so he turned away but had scarcely gone six or eight steps when
he looked round and gave me a sign I was to walk by him and then began
catechising

KING Where did you ER study

LINSENBARTH Your Majesty in Jena

KING What years

LINSENBARTH From 1716 to 1720 Born 1689 Rodenbeck p 474
twentyfive when he went

KING Under what Prorector were you inscribed

LINSENBARTH Under the PROFESSOR THEOLOGIAE Dr Fortsch

KING Who were your other Professors in the Theological Faculty

LINSENBARTHnames famed men sunk now mostly in the bottomless
wastebasket Buddaus who did a DICTIONARY of the BAYLE sort
weighing four stone troy out of which I have learned many a thing
Buddaeus Danz Weissenborn Wolf now back at Halle after his
tribulationspoor man his immortal System of Philosophy where is
it

KING Did you study BIBLICA diligently

LINSENBARTH With Buddaeus BEYM BUDDAO

KING That is he who had such quarrelling with Wolf

LINSENBARTH Yea your Majesty He was

KING does not want to know what he was What other useful Courses of
Lectures COLLEGIA did you attend

LINSENBARTH Thetics and Exegetics with Fortsch How the deuce did
Fortsch teach these things Hermeneutics and Polemics with Walch
editor ofLuthers WorksI suppose Hebraics with Dr Danz
Homiletics with Dr Weissenborn PASTORALE not Pastoral Poetry but
the Art of Pastorship and MORALE with Dr Buddaeus There your
Majestywhat a glimpse as into infinite extinct Continents filled
with ponderous thorny inanities invincible nasal drawling of didactic
Titans and the awful attempt to spin on all manner of wheels
roadharness out of split cobwebs Hoom Hoommm Harness not to be had
on those terms Let the dreary Limbus close again till the general Day
of Judgment for all this

KING glad to get out of the Limbus Were things as wild then at
Jena in your time as of old when the Students were forever
scuffling and ruffling and the Couplet went

 Wer kommt von Jena ungeschlagen
 Der hat von grossen Gluck zu sagen
 He that comes from Jena SINE BELLO
 He may think himself a lucky fellow

LINSENBARTH That sort of folly is gone quite out of fashion and
a man can lead a silent and quiet life there just as at other
Universities if he will attend to the DIC CURHIC or know what his
real errand is In my time their Serene Highnesses the Nursingfathers
of the University NUTRITORES ACADEMIAEof the Ernestine Line
WeimarGotha Highnesses that is were in the habit of having the
Rufflers RENOMISTEN Renowners as they are called who made so much
disturbance sent to Eisenach to lie in the Wartburg a while there they
learned to be quiet Clock strikes Twelvedinnertime of Majesty

KING Now I must go they are waiting for their soup and so ends
Dialogue for the present Did the King bid me wait

When we got out of the Garden says Linsenbarth silent on this point
the four Officers were still there upon the Esplanade Captains of
Guard belike they went into the Palace with the Kingclearly
meaning to dine with his Majesty

I remained standing on the Esplanade For twentyseven hours I had not
tasted food not a farthing IN BONIS of principal or interest to
get bread with I had waded twenty miles hither in a sultry morning
through the sand Not a difficult thing to keep down laughter in such
circumstancesPoor soul but the Royal mind is human tooIn this
tremor of my heart there came a KAMMERHUSSAR SoldierValet Valet
reduced to his simplest expression out of the Palace and asked Where
is the man that was with my King MEINEM KONIGTHY King particularly
in the Garden I answered Here And he led me into the Schloss to
a large Room where pages lackeys and Kammerhussars were about My
Kammerhussar took me to a little table excellently furnished with
soup beef likewise carp dressed with gardensalad likewise game with
cucumbersalad bread knife fork spoon and salt were all there and I
with an appetite of twentyseven hours I too was there My hussar set
me a chair said This that is on the table the King has ordered to be
served for you IHM you are to eat your fill and mind nobody and I
am to serve Sharp then fall toI was greatly astonished and knew
not what to do least of all could it come into my head that the Kings
Kammerhussar who waited on his Majesty should wait on me I pressed
him to sit by me but as he refused I did as bidden sat down took my
spoon and went at it with a will FRISCH

The hussar took the beef from the table set it on the charcoal dish
to keep it hot till wanted he did the like with the fish and
roast game and poured me out wine and beerwas ever such a lucky
Barmecide I ate and drank till I had abundantly enough Dessert
confectionery what I coulda plateful of big black cherries and a
plateful of pears my waitingman wrapped in paper and stuffed them into
my pockets to be a refreshment on the way home And so I rose from the
Royal table and thanked God and the King in my heart that I had so
gloriously dinedHERRLICH gloriously at last Poor excellent
downtrodden Linsenbarth ones heart opens to him not ones larder
only

The hussar took away At that moment a Secretary came brought me a
sealed Order Rescript to the Packhof at Berlin with my Certificates
TESTIMONIA and the Pass told down on the table five Tailducats
SCHWANZDUKATEN and a Gold Friedrich under them about 3 pounds 10s
I think better than 10 pounds of our day to a common man and better
than 100 pounds to a Linsenbarthsaying The King sent me this to
take me home to Berlin again

And if the hussar took me into the Palace it was now the Secretary
that took me out again And there yoked with six horses stood a royal
Proviantwagon which having led me to the Secretary said You people
the King has given order you are to take this stranger to Berlin and
also to accept no drinkmoney from him I again through the HERRN
SECRETARIUM testified my most submissive thankfulness for all Royal
graciousnesses took my place and rolled away

On reaching Berlin I went at once to the Packhof straight to the
officeroomstanding more erect this timeand handed them my Royal
Rescript The Head man opened the seal in reading he changed color
went from pale to red said nothing and gave it to the second man to
read The second put on his spectacles read and gave it to the third
However he the Head man rallied himself at last I was to come
forward and be so good as write a quittance receipt That I had
received for my 400 thalers all in Batzen the same sum in Brandenburg
coin ready down without the least deduction My cash was at once
accurately paid And thereupon the Steward was ordered To go with me to
the White Swan in the Judenstrasse and pay what I owed there whatever
my score was For which end they gave him twentyfour thalers and if
that were not enough he was to come and get more On these high terms
Linsenbarth marched out of the Packhof for the second time the sublime
head of him not turned either sweeping the very stars

That was what the King had meant when he said You shall have your
money back and interest too VIDELICET that the Packhof was to pay my
expenses at the White Swan The score however was only 10 thaler
4 groschen 6 pfennigs 30 shillings 5 pence and 2 or perhaps
3 quarterfarthings for what I had run up in eight weeksan
uncommonly frugal rate of board for a man skilled in Hermeneutics
Hebraics Polemics Thetica Exegetics Pastorale Morale and Practical
Christianity and the Philosophy of Zeno carried to perfection or
nearly soAnd herewith this troubled History had its desired finish
And our graywhiskered rawboned greathearted Candidatus lay down to
sleep at the White Swan probably the happiest man in all Berlin for
the time being

Linsenbarth dived now into Privateteaching INFORMATION as he calls
it forming and kneading into his own likeness such of the young
Berliners as he could get hold ofsurely not without some good effect
on them the model having besides Hermeneutics in abundance so much
natural worth about it He himself found the mine of Informing a very
barren one as to money continued poor in a high degree without honor
without emolument to speak of and had a straitened laborious and what
we might think very dark Lifepilgrimage But the darkness was nothing
to him he carried such an inextinguishable frugal rushlight within
Meat clothes and fire he did not again lack in Berlin for the time
he needed themsome twentyseven years still And if he got no printed
praise in the Reviews from baddish judges writing by the sheethere
and there brother mortals who knew him by their own eyes and
experiences looked or transiently spoke and even did a most real
praise upon him now and then And on the whole he can do without
praise and will stand strokes even without wincing or kicking where
there is no chance

A certain Berlin Druggist Herr MedicinalAssessor Rose whom we may
call Druggist First for there were Two that had to do with Linsenbarth
was good and human to him In Roses House where he had come to teach
the children and which continued always thenceforth a home to him
when needful he wrote this NARRATIVE Anno 1774 and died there three
years afterwards24th August 1777 of apoplexy age 88 say the

fame as is requisite




SIR JONAS HANWAY STALKS ACROSS THE SCENE TOO IN A PONDERING AND
OBSERVING MANNER

Of the then very famous Berlin Carrousel of 1750 we propose to say
little the now chief interesting point in it being that M de Voltaire
is curiously visible to us there But the truth is they were very great
days at Berlin those of Autumn 1750 distinguished strangers come
or coming the King giving himself up to entertainment of them to
enjoyment of them with such a hearty outburst of magnificence this
Carrousel the apex of it as was rare in his reign There were his
Sisters of Schwedt and Baireuth with suite his dear Wilhelmina queen
of the scene Came 8th August Rodenbeck 205 there wereIt
would be tedious to count what other high Herrschaften and Durchlauchtig
Persons And to crown the whole and entertain Wilhelmina as a Queen
should be there had come M de Voltaire conquered at length to us as
we hope and the Dream of our Youth realized Voltaires reception
July 10th and ever since has been mere splendor and kindness really
extraordinary as we shall find farther on Reception perfect in all
points except that of the Pompadours Compliments alone That sublime
creatures compliments to your Majesty such her express command
said Voltaire JE NE LA CONNAIS PAS answered Friedrich with his
clearringing voice I dont know her Voltaire to Madame Denis
Potsdam 11th August 1750 OEuvreslxxiv 184sufficient
intimation to Voltaire but painful and surprising For which some
diplomatic persons blame Friedrich to this day but not I or any reader
of mine A very proud young King in his silent way always the prouder
and stands in no awe of the Divine Butterflies and Crowned Infatuations
never so potent as more prudent people do

In a Berlin of such stir and splendor the arrivals of Sir Jonas Hanway
of the young Lord Malton famed Earl or Marquis of Rockingham that
will be or of the witty Excellency Hanbury are as nothingSir
Jonass as less than nothing A Sir Jonas noticed by nobody but himself
taking note dull worthy man and mentionable now on that account Here
is a Scrap regarding him not quite to be thrown away

Sir Jonas Hanway was not always so extinct as he has now become
Readers might do worse than turn to his now old Book of TRAVELS again
and the strange old London it awakens for us A Russian Trading
Company full of hope to the then mercantile mind a Mr Hanway
despatched years ago as Chief Clerk inexpressibly interested to
manage welland managing as you may read at large Has done his best
and utmost all this while and had such travellings through the
Naphtha Countries sailings on the Caspian such difficulties
successesultimately failure Owing to Mr Elton and Thamas Kouli
Khan mainly Thamas Kouli Khanotherwise called Nadir Shah and a very
hardheaded fellow by all appearancewiled and seduced Mr Elton an
ExNaval gentleman away from his Ledgers to build him Ships having
set his heart on getting a Navy And Mr Elton did build him spite of
all I could say a Bark or two on the Caspianmost hopeful to the said
Nadir Shah but did it come to anything It disgusted it alarmed
the Russians and ruined Sir Jonaswho is returning at this period
prepared to render account of himself at London in a loftily resigned
frame of mind Jonas HanwayAn Account of cor in brief TRAVELS
London 3 vols 4to 1753 ii 183 Arrived in Berlin from the
Caspian and Petersburg side August 15th 1750

The remarks of Sir Jonas upon Berlinfor he exercises everywhere a
sapient observation on men and thingsare of dim tumidly insignificant
character reminding us of an extinct Minervas Owl and reduce
themselves mainly to this bit of ocular testimony That his Prussian
Majesty rides much about often at a rapid rate with a pleasant
business aspect humane though imperative handsome to look upon though
with face perceptibly reddish and perhaps snuff on it were you near
His age now thirtyeight gone a set appearance as if already got into
his forties Complexion florid figure muscular almost tending to be
plump

Listen well through Hanway you will find King Friedrich is an object
of great interest personal as well as official and much the theme in
Berlin society admiration of him pride in him not now the audiblest
tone though it lies at the bottom too Our Friedrich the Great after
all so Hanway intimates though not express as to epithets or words
used The King did a beautiful thing to LieutenantColonel Keith the
other day as some readers may remember to LieutenantColonel Keith
that poor Keith who was nailed to the gallows for him in effigy at
Wesel long ago and got far less than he had expected The other
day there had been a grand Review part of it extending into Madam
Knyphausens grounds who is Keiths Motherinlaw Monsieur Keith
said the King to him I am sorry we had to spoil Madams fine
shrubbery by our manoeuvres have the goodness to give her that with my
apologiesand handed him a pretty Casket with key to it and in the
interior 10000 crowns Not a shrub of Madams had been cut or injured
but the King you see would count it 1500 pounds of damage done
and here is acknowledgment for it which please accept Is not that a
gracious little touch

This King is doing something at Embden Sir Jonas fears or trying to
do in the TradeandNavigation way scandalous that English capitalists
will lend money in furtherance of such destructive schemes by the
Foreigner For the rest Sir Jonas went to call on Lord Malton Marquis
of Rockingham that will be an amiable and sober young Nobleman
come thus far on his Grand Tour and in time for the Carrousel His
Lordships reception at Court here one regretted to hear was nothing
distinguished quite indifferent indeed had not the QueenMother stept
in with amendments The Courts are not well together pity for it My
Lord and his Tutor did me the honor to return my visit the rather as
we all quartered in the same Inn Amiable young Noblemanso
distinguished since for having had unconsciously an Edmund Burke
and such torrents of Parliamentary Eloquence in his breechespocket
BREECHESPOCKET literally how unknown to HanwayAmiable young
Nobleman is not it ones duty to salute in passing such a one Though
I would by no means have it overdone and am a calmly independent man

Sir Jonas also saw the Carrousel of which presently and admired the
great men of Berlin Great men all obsolete now though then admired
to infinitude some of them You may abuse me said the King to some
stranger arrived in Berlin you may abuse me and perhaps here
and there get praise by doing it but I advise you not to doubt of
Lieberkuhn the fashionable Doctor in any company in Berlin Hanway
ii 190 202 cHow fashionable are men

One Collini a young Italian quite new in Berlin chanced also to be at
the Carrousel or at the latter half of itthough by no means in
quest of such objects just at present poor young fellow As he came
afterwards to be Secretary or Amanuensis of Voltaire and will turn up
in that capacity let us read this Note upon him

Signor Como Alessandro Collini a young Venetian gentleman of some
family and education but of no employment or resource had in late
years been asking zealously all round among his home circle What am I
to do with myself mere echo answering Whattill a Signora Sister
of Barberina the Dancers answered Try Berlin and King FRIDERICO IL
GRANDE there I could give you a letter to my Sister At which Collini
grasps gets under way for Berlinthrough wild Alpine sceneries
foreign guttural populations and with what thoughts poor young fellow
It is a common course to take and sometimes answers sometimes not The
cynosure of vague creatures with a sense of faculty without direction
What clouds of winged migratory people gathering in to Berlin all
through this Reign Not since Noahs Ark a stranger menagerie of
creatures mostly wild Of whom Voltaire alone is in our time worth
mention

Collini gazed upon the Alpine chasms and shaggy icepalaces with
tender memory of the Adriatic courageously steered his way through the
inoffensive guttural populations had got to Berlin just in this time
been had to dinner daily by the hospitable Barberinas young Cocceji
always his fellowguestPrivately my poor Signorinas Husband
whispered old Mamma Both the Barberinas were very kind to Collini
cheering him with good auguries and offers of help Collini does not
date with any punctuality but the German Books will do it for him
August 25th27th was Carrousel and Collini had arrived few days
before ColliniMon Sejour aupres de VoltaireParis 1807 pp

And now it is time we were at the Carrousel ourselvesin a brief
transient way




Chapter VIBERLIN CARROUSEL AND VOLTAIRE VISIBLE THERE

Readers have heard of the PLACE DU CARROUSEL at Paris and know probably
that Louis XIV held worldfamous Carrousel there AD 1662 and
in general that Carrousel has something to do with Tourneying or
the Shadow of Tourneying It is in fact a kind of superb betailored
running at the ring instead of beblacksmithed running at one another
A Second milder Edition of those Tournament sports and dangerous trials
of strength and dexterity which were so grand a business in the Old
iron Ages Of which in the form of Carrousel or otherwise down
almost to the present day there have been examples among puissant
Lordsthough now it is felt to have become extremely hollow perhaps
incapable of fully entertaining anybody except children and their
nurses on a high occasion

A century ago before the volcanic explosion of so many things which
it has since become wearisome to think of in this earnest world the
Tournament emblem of an Age of Chivalry which was gone but had not
yet declared itself to be quite gone and even to be turned topsyturvy
had still substance as a mummerynot enough I should say to spend
much money upon Not much real money except indeed the money were
offered you gratis from other parties interested Sir Jonas kindly
informs us by insinuation that this was to a good degree Friedrichs
case in the now Carrousel a thing got up by the private efforts of
different great Lords and Princes of the blood each party tailoring
harnessing and furbishing himself and followers Friedrich contributing
little but the arena and general outfit I know not whether even the
40000 lamps for it took place by night were of his purchase though
that is likely and know only that the Suppers and interior Palace
Entertainments would be his Did not cost the King much money says
Sir Jonas which is satisfactory to know For of the Carrousel kind
or of the RoyalMummery kind in general there has been for graceful
arrangement for magnificence regardless of expenseinviting your
amiable Lord Malton and the idlers of all Countries and awakening the
rapture of Gazetteersnothing like it since Louis the Grands time
Nothingexcept perhaps that Camp of Muhlberg or Radowitz where we
once were Done this one not at the Kings expense alone but at other
peoples chiefly that is an unexpected feature welcome if true and
except for Sir Jonas would not have helped to explain the puzzle
for us as it did in the then Berlin circles Muhlberg in my humble
judgment was worth two of this as a Mummerybut the meritorious
feature of Friedrichs is that it cost him very little

It was say all Gazetteers and idle eyewitnesses a highly splendid
spectacle By much the most effulgent exhibition Friedrich ever made of
himself in the ExpensiveMummery department and I could give in extreme
detail the phenomena of it but in mercy to poor readers will not
Fancy the assiduous hammering and sawing on the SchlossPlatz amid
crowds of gay loungers giving cheerful note of preparation in those
latter days of August 1750 And on WEDNESDAY NIGHT 25th AUGUST
look and seefor the due moments only and vaguely enough as in the
following Excerpt

PALACEESPLANADE OF BERLIN 25th AUGUST 1750 dusk sinking into dark
Under a windy nocturnal sky a spacious Parallelogram enclosed for
jousting as at Aspramont or Trebisond Wide enough arena in the centre
vast amphitheatre of wooden seats and passages firm carpentry and
fitted for its business rising all round Audience select though
multitudinous sitting decorous and garrulous say since halfpast
eight There is royal box on the groundtier and the King in it King
with Princess Amelia for the prizes opposite to this is entrance for
the Chevaliersfour separate entrances I think Who comelo at
lastwith breathings and big swells of music as Resuscitations from
the buried Ages

They are in four Quadrilles so termed Romans Persians
Carthaginians Greeks Four Jousting Parties headed each by a Prince
of the Bloodwith such a splendor of equipment for jewels silver
helmets sashings housings as eye never saw Prancing on their
glorious battlesteeds shambattle steeds not sham but champing their
bits as real quadrupeds with fire in their interiorhow many in all
I forgot to count Perhaps on the average sixty in each Quadrille
fifteen of them practical Ritters the rest mythologic winged
standardbearers blackamoors lictors trumpeters and shining melodious
phantasms as escortof this latter kind say in round numbers Two
Hundred altogether and of actual Ritters threescore BlumenthalLife

flourishings of drums and trumpets under bursts and breathings of
windmusic under the shine of Forty Thousand Lamps for one item All
Berlin and the nocturnal firmament looking onnight rather gusty
which blew out many of the lamps insinuates Hanway

About midnight Beauty in the form of Princess Amelia distributes the
prizes Music filling the air and human EUGES and the surviving
lamps doing their best After which the Principalities and Ritters
withdraw to their Palace to their Balls and their Supper of the gods
and all the world and his wife goes home again amid various commentary
from high and low JAMAIS Never murmured one high Gentleman of the
Impromptu kind at the Palace Suppertable

 Jamais dans Athene et dans Rome
 On neut de plus beaux jours ni de plus digne prix
 Jai vu le fils de Mars sous les traits de Paris
 Et Venus qui donnait la pomme

Never in Athens or Rome were there braver sights or a worthier prize
I have seen the son of Mars King Friedrich with Pariss features and
Venus Amelia crowning the victorious OEuvres de Voltairexviii

And Amphitheatre and Lamps lapse wholly into darkness and the thing has
finished for the time being August 27th it was repeated by daylight
if possible more charming than ever but not to be spoken of farther
under penalties To be mildly forgotten again every jot and tittle
of itexcept one small insignificant iota which by accident still
makes it remarkable Namely that Collini and the Barberinas were
there and that not only was Voltaire again there among the Princes and
Princesses but that Collini saw Voltaire and gives us transient
sight of himthanks to Collini Thursday 27th August 1750 was the
Daylight version of the Carrousel which Collini if it were of any
moment takes to have PRECEDED that of the 40000 Lamps Sure enough
Collini was there with eyes open

Madame de Cocceji so one may call her though the known alias is
Barberina had engaged places she invited me to come and see this
Festivity We went and very grand it was The PalaceEsplanade was
changed by carpentries and draperies into a vast Amphitheatre the
slopes of it furnished with benches for the spectators and at the four
corners of it and at the bottom magnificently decorated boxes for the
Court Vast oval Amphitheatre the interior arena rectangular with its
Four Entrances one for each of the Four Quadrilles The assemblage was
numerous and brilliant all the Court had come from Potsdam to Berlin

A little while before the King himself made appearance there rose
suddenly a murmur of admiration and I heard all round me from
everybody the name Voltaire Voltaire Looking down I saw Voltaire
accordingly among a group of great lords who were walking over the
Arena towards one of the Court Boxes He wore a modest countenance
but joy painted itself in his eyes you cannot love glory and not feel
gratefully the prize attached to itattained as here I lost sight
of him in few instants as he approached his Box the place where I was
not permitting farther view ColliniMon Sejourp 21

This was Collinis first sight of that great man DE CE GRAND HOMME
With whom thanks to Barberina he had in a day or two the honor of an
Interview judgment favorable he could hope and before many months
Accident also favoring the inexpressible honor of seeing himself the
great mans Secretaryhow far beyond hope or aspiration in these
Carrousel days

Voltaire had now been here some Seven Weeksarrived 10th July as
we often noteafter on his own part a great deal of haggling
hesitating and negotiating which we spare our readers The poor man
having now become a QuasiWidower painfully rallying with his whole
strength towards new arrangementsnow was the time for Friedrich to
urge him Come to me Away from all that dismal imbroglio hither I
say To which Voltaire is not inattentive though he hesitates cannot
in any case come without delaylingers in Paris readjusting many
things the poor shipwrecked being among kind DArgentals and friends
Poor Ishmael getting gray and his tent in the desert suddenly carried
off by a blast of wind

To the legal Widower M le Marquis he behaves in money matters like

but he hesitates greatly about lifting anchor Friedrich insists in a
bright bantering kindly way You were due to me a year ago you said
always So soon as the lyingin is over I am yoursand now why
dont you come

Friedrich since they met last has had some experiences of Voltaire
which he does not like Their roads trulyone adulating Trajan
in Versailles and growing great by Farces of the Fair the other
battling for his existence against men and devils Trajan and Company
includedhave lain far apart Their Correspondence perceptibly
languishing in consequence and even rumors rising on the subject
Voltaire wrote once Give me a yard of ribbon Sire your ORDER OF
MERIT Sire to silence those vile rumors Which Friedrich on such
freeandeasy terms had silently declined A meddlesome forward kind
of fellow always getting into scrapes and brabbles thinks Friedrich
But is really anxious now that the chance offers again to have such
a Levite for his Priest the evident pink of Human Intellect and tries
various incitements upon himhits at last I know not whether by
device or by accident on one which say the French Biographers did
raise Voltaire and set him under way

A certain M Baculard dArnaud a conceited foolish young fellow much
patronized by Voltaire and given to write verses which are unknown to
me has been on Voltaires recommending Literary Correspondent
to Friedrich Paris BookAgent and the like for some time past
corresponding much with Potsdam in a way found entertaining and is now
April 1750 actually going thither to Friedrichs Court or perhaps
has gone At any rate Friedrichby accident or by devicehad answered
some rhymes of this DArnaud Yes welcome young sunrise since
Voltaire is about to set OEuvres de Fredericxiv 95 Verses A
DARNAUD of date December 1749 I hope it was by device DArnaud
is such a silly fellow too absurd to reckon as morning to anybodys
sunset Except for his involuntary service for and against in
this Voltaire Journey his name would not now be mentionable at
all Sunset exclaimed Voltaire springing out of bed say the
Biographers and skipping about indignantly in his shirt I will
show them I am not set yet Duvernet Second p 159 And instantly
resolved on the Berlin Expedition Went to Compiegne where the Court
then was to bid his adieus nay to ask formally the Royal leavefor
we are Historiographer and titular Gentleman of the Chamber and Kings
servant in a sense Leave was at once granted him almost huffingly we
hope not with too much readiness For this is a ticklish point one is
going to Prussia on a Visit merely though it may be longish one
would not have the door of France slammed to behind one The tone at
Court did seem a little succinct something almost of sneer in it
But from the Pompadour herself all was friendly mere witty
cheery graciosities and My Compliments to his Majesty of
PrussiaCompliments how answered when they came to hand JE NE LA
CONNAIS PAS

In short M de Voltaire made all his arrangements got under way
piously visited Fontenoy and the Battlefields in passing and is here
since July 10thin very great splendor as we seeon his Fifth Visit
to Friedrich Fifth which proved his Lastand is still extremely
celebrated in the world Visit much misunderstood in France and
England down to this day By no means sorted out into accuracy and
intelligibility but left as what is saying a great deal probably the
wastest chaos of all the Sections of Friedrichs History And has alone
of them gone over the whole world being withal amusing to read
and therefore well and widely remembered in that mendacious and
semiintelligible state To lay these goblins full of noise ignorance
and mendacity and give some true outline of the matter with what
brevity is consistent with deciphering it at all is now our sad
tasklaborious perhaps disgusting not impossible if readers will
loyally assist

Voltaire had taken every precaution that this Visit should succeed or
at least be no loss to one of the parties In a preliminary Letter from
Parisprose and verse one of the cleverest diplomatic pieces ever
penned Letter really worth looking at cunning as the song of Apollo
Voltaire symbolically intimates Well Sire your old Danae poor
malingering old wretch is coming to her Jove It is Jove she wants
not the Shower of Jove neverthelessAnd Friedrich thank Hanbury

Formey says In the Carnival time which Voltaire usually passed at
Berlin in the Palace people paid their court to him as to a declared
Favorite Princes Marshals Ministers of State Foreign Ambassadors
Lords of the highest rank attended his audience and were received
says Formey nowhere free from spite on this subject in a sufficiently
lofty style HAUTEUR ASSEZ DEDAIGNEUSE FormeySouvenirsi 235
236 A great Prince had the complaisance to play chess with him and
to let him win the pistoles that were staked Sometimes even the pistole
disappeared before the end of the game continues Formey green
with spiteand reports that sad story of the candleends bits of
waxcandle which should have remained as perquisite to the valets
but which were confiscated by Voltaire and sent across to the
waxchandlers So doubtless the spiteful rumor ran probably little
but spite and fable Berlin being bitter in its gossip Stupid Thiebault
repeats that of the candleends like a thing he had seen twelve years
BEFORE his arrival in those parts and adds that Voltaire put them in
his pocketlike one both stupid and sordid Alas the brighter your
shine the blacker is the shadow you cast

Friedrich with the knowledge he already had of his yokefellowone
of the most skittish explosive unruly creatures in harnesscannot
be counted wise to have plunged so heartily into such an adventure with
him An undoubted Courser of the Sun thought Friedrichand forgot
too much the signs of bad going he had sometimes noticed in him on the
common highways There is no doubt he was perfectly sincere and simple
in all this high treatment of Voltaire The foremost literary
spirit of the world a man to be honored by me and by all men the
Trismegistus of Human Intellects what a conquest to have made how
cheap is a little money a little patience and guidance for such
solacement and ornament to ones barren Life He had rashly hoped that
the dreams of his youth could hereby still be a little realized and
something of the old Reinsberg Program become a fruitful and blessed
fact Friedrich is loyally glad over his Voltaire eager in all ways to
content him make him happy and keep him here as the Talking Bird the
Singing Tree and the Golden Water of intelligent mankind the glory of
ones own Court and the envy of the world Will teach us the secret
of the Muses too French Muses and help us in our bits of Literature
This latter too is a consideration with Friedrich as why should it
notthough by no means the sole or chief one as the French give it
out to be

On his side Voltaire is not disloyal either but is nothing like so
completely loyal He has and continued always to have not unmixed with
fear a real admiration for Friedrich that terrible practical Doer
with the cutting brilliances of mind and character and the irrefragable
common sense nay he has even a kind of love to him or something like
itlove made up of gratitude for past favors and lively anticipation
of future Voltaire is by nature an attached or attachable creature
flinging out fond boughs to every kind of excellence and especially
holding firm by old ties he had made One fancies in him a mixed set of
emotions direct and reflexthe consciousness of safe shelter were
there nothing more of glory to oneself derived and still derivable
from this high manin fine a sumtotal of actual desire to live
with King Friedrich which might surely have almost sufficed even for
Voltaire in a quieter element But the element was not quietfar from
it nor was Voltaire easily sufficeable



PERPETUAL PRESIDENT MAUPERTUIS HAS A VISIT FROM ONE KONIG OUT OF
HOLLAND CONCERNING THE INFINITELY LITTLE

Whether Maupertuis in red wig with yellow bottom saw these high
gauderies of the Carrousel the Plays in Princess Amelias Antechamber
and the rest of it I do not know but if so he was not in the top
place nor did anybody take notice of him as everybody did of Voltaire
Meanwhile I have something to quote as abridged and distilled from
various sources chiefly from Formey which will be of much concernment
farther on

Some four weeks after those Carrousel effulgencies Perpetual President
Maupertuis had a visit September 21st just while the Sun was crossing
the Line thanks to Formey for the date who keeps a Notebook
useful in these intricacies visit from Professor Konig an effective
mathematical man from the Dutch parts Whom readers have forgotten
again though they saw him once in violent quarrel about the
Infinitely Little with Madame du Chatelet Voltaire witnessing with
painit was just as they quitted Cirey together ten years ago for
these new courses of adventure Do readers recall the circumstance
Maupertuis referee in that quarrel had with a bluntness offensive to
the female mind declared Konig indisputably in the right and there had
followed a dryness between the divine Emilie and the Flattener of the
Earth scarcely to be healed by Voltaires best efforts

Konig has gone his road since then become a fine solid fellow
Professor in a Dutch University more latterly Librarian to the Dutch
Stadtholder still frank of speech and with a rugged freeandeasy
turn but of manful manners really a person of various culture and as
is still noticeable of a solid geometric turn of mind Having now as
Librarian at the Hague more leisure and more money he has made a run
to Berlinchiefly or entirely to see his Maupertuis again whom he
still remembers gratefully as his first Patron in older times and a man
of sound parts though rather blusterous now and then A little bit of
scientific business also he has with him Konig is Member of the Berlin
Academy for some years back and there is a thing he would speak with
the Perpetual President upon Wants nothing else in Berlin says
Formey a hearing by the road that Maupertuis was not there he had
actually turned homewards again but got truer tidings and came on
The more was the pity as perhaps will appearHe arrived September 20th
if you will be particular on cheeseparings called on me that day
being lodged in my neighborhood and next day found Maupertuis at
home Formey i 176179and flew into his arms again like a good
boy long absent

Maupertuis not many months ago had in Two successive Papers I think
Two communicated to the Academy a Discovery of MetaphysicoMathematical
or altogether Metaphysical nature on the Laws of MotionDiscovery
which he has since that brought to complete perfection and sent forth
to the Universe at large in his sublime little Book of COSMOLOGY In
La BeaumelleVie de MaupertuisParis 1856 pp 105130 confused
account of this Discovery and of the gradual Publication of it to
mankindvery gradual first of all in the old Paris times in the
Berlin ACADEMY latterly and in fine to all the world in this ESSAI
DE COSMOLOGIE Berlin Summer of 1750grateful Academy striving to
admire and believe with its Perpetual President that the Discovery
was sublime to a degree second only to the flattening of the Earth and
would probably stand thenceforth as a milestone in the Progress of Human
Thought Which Discovery then Be not too curious reader take only
of it what shall concern you

It is well known there have been to the metaphysical head difficulties
almost insuperable as to How in the System of Nature Motion is
How in the name of wonder it can be and even Whether it is at all
Difficulties to the metaphysical head sticking its nose into the gutter
therenot difficult to my readers and me who can at all times walk
across the room and triumphantly get over them But stick your nose
into any gutter entity or object this of Motion or another
with obstinacyyou will easily drown if that be your
determinationSuffice it for us to know in this matter that
Maupertuis intensely watching Nature has discovered That the key of
her enigma or at least the ultimate central DOOR which hides all
her Motional enigmas the key to WHICH cannot even be imagined as
discoverable is that Nature is superlatively THRIFTY in this affair
of motion that she employs for every Motion done or doable a
MINIMUM OF ACTION and that if you well understand this you will at
least announce all her procedures in one proposition and have found
the DOOR which leads to everything Which will be a comfort to you
still looking vainly for the key if there is still no key conceivable

Perpetual President Maupertuis having surprised Nature in this manner
read Papers upon it to an Academy listening with upturned eyes new
Papers perfected out of oldfor he has long been hatching these
Phoenixeggs and has sent them out complete quite lately in a little
Book called COSMOLOGIE where alone I have had the questionable benefit
of reading them Grandly brief as if coming from Delphi the utterance
is loftily solemn elaborately modest abstruse to the now human mind
but intelligible had it only been worth understandinga painful
little Book that COSMOLOGIE as the Perpetual Presidents generally
are Minimum of Action LOI DEPARGNE Law of Thrift he calls this
sublime Discoverythinks it will be Sovereign in Natural Theology
as well For how could Nature be a Saveall without Designer
presentand speaks of course among other technical points about
VIS VIVA or Velocity multiplied by the Square of the Time which two
points LOI DEPARGNE and that the VIS VIVA is always a Minimum
the reader can take along with him I will permit him to shake the
others into Limbo again as forgettable by human nature at this epoch
and henceforth

In La BeaumellesVie de Maupertuisprinted at last Paris 1856
after lying nearly a century in manuscript an obtuse worthless leaden
little Book there is much loud droning and detailing about this
COSMOLOGIE this sublime Discovery and the other sublime Discoveries
Insights and Apocalyptic Utterances of Maupertuis though in so confused
a fashion it is seldom you can have the poor pleasure of learning
exactly when or except by your own severe scrutiny exactly what For
reasons that will appear certain of those Apocalyptic Utterances by
Perpetual President Maupertuis have since got a new interest and one
has actually a kind of wish to read the IPSISSIMA VERBA of them at
this date But in La Beaumelle his modern Editor lying fast asleep
throughout there is no vestige of help Nay Maupertuiss own Book
OEuvres de MaupertuisLyon 1756 4 vols 4to luxurious

buy for these and the cognate objectsproves altogether worthless

solemnly emphatic statement of what you already know concentrated
struggle to get on wing and failure by so narrow a miss struggle which
gets only on tiptoe and wont cease wriggling and flapping and
then to your horror they prove to be carefully cleaned of all
the MaupertuisVOLTAIRE matteredition being SUBSEQUENT to that
worldfamous explosion CAVEAT EMPTOROur Excerpt proceeds

Industrious Konig like other mathematical people has been listening
to these Oracles on the Law of Minimum by the Perpetual President
and grieves to find after study That said Law does not quite hold
that in fact it is like Descartess old key or general door worth
little or nothing as Leibnitz long ago seems to have transiently
recognized Konig has put his strictures on paper but will not dream
of publishing till the Perpetual President have examined them and
satisfied himself and that is Konigs business at present as he knocks
on Maupertuis while Sol is crossing the Line Maupertuis has a House of
the due style Wife a daughter of Minister Borcks high Borcks old
as the DIUVEL no childrenhis back courts always a good deal dirty
with pelicans bustards perhaps snakes and other zoological wretches
which sometimes intrude into the drawingrooms otherwise very fine A
man of some whims some habits arbitrary by nature but really honest
though rather sublimish in his interior with red Wig and yellow bottom

Konig all filial gladness is received gladlythough by degrees
with some surprise on the paternal part to find Konig ripened out of
son client and pupil into independent posture of a grown man Frankly
certain enough about himself and about the axioms of mathematics
Standing evidently on his own legs kindly as ever but on these
new termsin fact rather an outspoken freeandeasy fellow I should
guess not thinking that offence can be taken among friends Formey
confesses this was uncomfortable to Maupertuis in fact a shock which
he could not recover from They had various meetings over dinner aud
otherwise at the Perpetual Presidents for perhaps two weeks at
this time dates all to be had in Formeys Notebook if anybody would
consult in the whole course of which the shock to the Perpetual
President increased instead of diminishing Republican freedom and
equality is evidently Konigs method Konig heeds not a whit the
oracular talent or majestic position of Maupertuis argues with the
frankest logic when he feels dissentdrives a majestic Perpetual
President especially in the presence of third parties much out of
patience Thus one evening replying to some argument of the Perpetual
Presidents he begins My poor friend MON PAUVRE AMI dont you
perceive thenUpon which Maupertuis sprang from his chair violently
stamping and pirouetted round the room Poor friend poor friend
are you so rich then frank Konig merely grinning till the paroxysm
passed Formey i 177 Konig went home again RE INFECTA about the
end of the month

Such a Konighad better not have come As to his strictures on the LAW
OF THRIFT the arguings on them alone together or with friends by
merely set Maupertuis pirouetting and as to the Konig Manuscripts
on them to be published in the Leipzig ACTA after your remarks and
permission Maupertuis absolutely refused to look at said Manuscripts
Publish them there here everywhere in the Devil and his
Grandmothers name and then there is an end Monsieur Konig went his
ways therefore finding nothing else for it published his strictures
in the Leipzig ACTA in March nextand never saw Maupertuis again for
one result out of several that followed I have no doubt he was out to
Voltaire more than once in this fortnight and eat the Kings roast
pleasantly with that eminent old friend Voltaire always thought him
a BON GARCON justly by all the evidence I have and finds his talk
agreeable and his Berlin newsespecially that of Maupertuis and his
explosive pirouettings Adieu Herr Professor you know not with
your Leipzig ACTA and Fragment of Leibnitz what an explosion you are
preparing




Chapter VIIM DE VOLTAIRE HAS A PAINFUL JEWLAWSUIT

Voltaires Terrestrial Paradise at Berlin did not long continue perfect
Scarcely had that grand Carrousel vanished in the azure firmaments
when little clouds began rising in its stead and before long black
thunderstorms of a very strange and even dangerous character

It must have been a painful surprise to Friedrich to hear from his
Voltaire some few weeks after those munificences That he Voltaire
was in very considerable distress of mind from the bad not to call it
the felonious and traitorous conduct of M DArnaudonce Friedrichs
shoeinghorn and risingsun for Voltaires behoof now a vague
flaunting creature without significance to Friedrich or anybody That
DArnaud had done this and done that of an AntiVoltairian treasonous
natureand that in short life was impossible in the neighborhood of
such a DArnaudDArnaud has corrupted my Clerk Prince Henri hungering
in vain for LA PUCELLE has got sight of it in this way Clerk was
dismissed accordingly one Tinois an ingenious creatureand COLLINI
appointed in his stead DArnaud has been gossiping to Freron and the
Paris Newspapers DArnaud has Voltaire to Friedrich OEuvres de
Fredericxxii 257 undated November 1750Has in effect
been a flaunting young fool of dissolute esurient slightly profligate
turn occasionally helping in the Theatricals and much studious to make
himself notable and useful to the Princely kind A DArnaud of nearly
no significance to Friedrich or to anybody A DArnaud whose bits of
fooleries and struttings about in the peacock or jackdaw way might
surely have been below the notice of a Trismegistus

Friedrich painfully made sensible what a skinless explosive
Trismegistus he has got on hand answers I suppose in words little or
nothingin Letters I observe answers absolutely nothing to Voltaire
repeating and rerepeatingdoes simply dismiss DArnaud a BON
DIABLE as Voltaire to impartial people calls him or accept
DArnauds demission and cut the poor fool adrift Who sallies out into
infinite space to Paris latterly alive there in 1805 and claims
henceforth perpetual oblivion from us and mankind And now there will be
peace in our garden of the gods and perpetual azure will return

Alas DArnaud is not well gone when there has begun brewing in
threefold secrecy a mass of galvanic matter which in few weeks more
filled the Heavens with miraculous foul gases and the blackness of
darknesswhich in short exploded about Newyears time as the
worldfamous VOLTAIREHIRSCH LAWSUIT still remembered though only as a
portent and mystery by observant onlookers Of which it is now our sad
duty to say something though nowhere in the Annals of Jurisprudence
is there a more despicable thing or a deeper involved in lies and
deliriums by current reporters of it about which the sane mind can be
called upon accidentally to speak a word Beaten riddled shovelled
washed in many waters by a patient though disgusted Predecessor in
this field there lies by me a copious but wearisome Narrative of this
matterthe more vivid portions of which if rightly disengaged and
shown in sequence may satisfy the curious

Duvernet who I can guess had talked with DArget on the subject has
alone of the French Biographers some glimmer of knowledge about it
Duvernet admits that it was a thing of Illegal Stockjobbing that

1 That M de Voltaire had agreed with a Jew named Hirsch to go to
Dresden and illegally PURCHASE a good lot of STEUERSCHEINE Saxon
Exchequer Bills which are payable in gold to a BONA FIDE PRUSSIAN
holding them but are much in discount otherwise as readers may
remember and given Hirsch a Draft on Paris due after some weeks for
payment of the same Hirsch leaving him a stock of jewels in pledge till
the STEUERSCHEINE themselves come to hand

2 That Hirsch having things of his own in view with the money sent
no STEUERSCHEINE from Dresden nothing but vague lying talk instead
of STEUER so that Voltaires suspicions naturally kindling he stopped
payment of the Paris Draft and ordered Hirsch to come home at once

3 That Hirsch coming a settlement was tried Give me back my Draft
on Paris you objectionable blockhead of a Hirsch there are your
Diamonds there is something even for your expenses some fair moiety
I think and let me never see your unpleasant face again To
which Hirsch examining the diamonds answered says Duvernet not
substantially incorrect hitherto though stepping along in total
darkness and very partial on Voltaires behalfHirsch examining the
diamonds answered But you have changed some of them I cannot take
theseand drove Voltaire quite to despair and into the LawCourts
which imprisoned Hirsch and made him do justice Duvernet TJDV
170 173 175vague utterly dateless tries one date and is mistaken
even in the Year wrong in nearly every detail the STAIRE or STEUER
was a BANK c c

In which last clause still more in the conclusion that it was to the
triumph of Voltaire Duvernet does substantially mistake And indeed
except as the best Parisian reflex of this matter his Account is
worth nothingthough it may serve as Introduction to the following
irrefragable Documents and more explicit featurings We learn from him
and it is the one thing we learn of credible That Voltaire when
it came to Law Procedures begged Maupertuis to speak for him to M
Jarriges a Prussian Frenchman one of the Judges and that Maupertuis
answered I cannot interfere in a bad business ME MELER DUNE MAUVAISE
AFFAIRE The other French Biographies definable as IGNORAMUS
speaking in a loud voice to IGNORATIS require to be altogether swept
aside in this matter Even Clog jumbling Voltaires undated LETTERS
into confusion thrice confounded and droning out vituperatively in the
dark becomes a MINUS quantity in these Friedrich affairs In regard
to the Hirsch Process our one irrefragable set of evidences is The
Prussian LAWREPORT by KLEINespecially the Documents produced in
Court and the Sentence given Ernst Ferdinand KleinAnnalen
der Gesetzgebung und Rechtsgelehrsamkeit in den Preussischen
StaatenBerlin und Stettin 1790 v 215260 Other lights are to
be gathered with severe scrutiny and caution from the circumambient
contemporary rumorespecially from the PREFACE to a Comedy so called
of TANTALE EN PROCES Tantalus Voltaire at Lawwhich PREFACE is
evidently Hirschs own Story put into language for him by some humane
friend and addressed to a clearseeing Public TANTALE EN PROCES
ascribed to Friedrich himself by some wonderful persons is
inSupplement aux OEuvres Posthumes de Frederic IICologne 1789
i 319 et seq Among the weakest of Comedies might be by DArnaud or
some such hand nothing in it worth reading except the Preface And
in fine says my Manuscript by sweeping out the distinctly false
and well discriminating the indubitable from what is still in part
dubitable sufficient twilight abridgable in a high degree I hope
rises over the Affair to render it visible in all its main features




THE VOLTAIREHIRSCH TRANSACTION PART I ORIGIN OF LAWSUIT 10th
November25th December 1750

Saxon STEUERSCHEIN some readers know is in the rough equivalent to
Exchequer Bill Payable at the Saxon Treasury to Prussians in gold to
all other men in paper onlywhich thanks to Bruhl and his unheardof
expenditures and financierings is now at a discount say of 25 or even
30 per cent By Article Eleventh of the Dresden TREATY OF PEACE King
Friedrich if our readers have not forgotten got stipulated That all
Prussian holders of these SCHEINE should be paid in gold interest
at the due days and at the due days principal itselfin gold they
whatever became of others No farther specifications as to proof
method limits or conditions of any kind occur in regard to this
Eleventh Article which is a just one beyond doubt but most carelessly
drawn up Apparently it trusts altogether to the personal honesty of all
Prussian subjects Prove yourself a Prussian subject and we pay your
SteuerSchein in real money But now if a Saxon or other NonPrussian
who can get no payment save in paper were to have his Note smuggled or
trafficked over into Prussia and presented as a Prussian one In our
time such traffic would start on the morrow morning and in a week or
two all Notes whatsoever would be presented as Prussian payable in
gold Not so in those daysthough a small contraband of that kind does
by degrees threaten to establish itself and Friedrich had to publish
severe rescripts one before this HirschVoltaire business 10th
August 1748 Seyfarth i 62 one still severer after and menace
it down again The malpractice seems to have proved menaceable in that
manner nor was any new arrangement made upon itno change till the
SteuerScheine by their gradual terms were all paid either in real
money or imaginary and thus in the course of years the thing burnt to
the socket and went out

Voltaires rash Adventure dangerous Navigation and gradual Wreck
in this Forbidden Sea of SteuerScheinewill become conceivable to
readers on study diligent enough of the following Documents and select
Details


DOCUMENT FIRST a small Missive in Voltaires hand

Je prie instamment monsieur hersch de venir demain mardi matin a
potsdam pour affaire pressante et daporter SIC avec luy les diamants
qui doivent servir pour la representation de la tragedie qui se jouera a
cinq heures de soir chez SAR Monseigneur le Prince henri Ce lundy a
midy VOLTAIRE

Which being interpreted rightly spelt and dated as by chance we can
do with distinctness will run as follows in English

POTSDAM Monday 9th November 1750 I earnestly request Mr Hirsch to
come tomorrow Tuesday morning to Potsdam on business that is urgent
and to bring with him the Diamonds needed for the Tragedy which is to
be represented at five in the evening in His Royal Highness Prince
Henrys Apartment Klein v 260

On Tuesday the 10th say the Old Newspapers was ROME SAUVEEwith
Voltaire perceptible there as CICERON Rodenbeck i 209 in due
 A glorious enough Ciceroand such a piece of urgent business done
with your Hirsch just before emerging on the stage

Hirsch in that NARRATIVE describes himself as a young innocent
creature Not very old we will believe but as to innocenceFor
certain he is named Abraham Hirsch or Hirschel a Berlin Jew of the
Period whom one inclines to figure as a florid oily man of Semitic
features in the prime of life who deals much in jewels moneys loans
exchanges all kinds of Jew barter whether absolutely in old clothes
we do not knowcertainly not unless there is a penny to be turned The
man is of oily Semitic type not old in yearsthere is a fraternal
Hirsch and also a paternal who is head of the firmand this
young one seems to be already old in Jew art Speaks French and other
dialects in a Hebrew partially intelligible manner supplies Voltaire
with diamonds for his stagedresses as we perceive To all appearance
nearly destitute of human intellect but with abundance of vulpine
instead Very cunning stupid seemingly as a mule otherwiseand
on the whole resembling in various points of character a mule put into
breeches and made acquainted with the uses of money He is come on
pressing businessperhaps not of stagediamonds alone Here now is
DOCUMENT SECOND nearly of the same date may be of the very samemore
likely is a few days later and betokens mysterious dialogue and
consultation held on Tuesday 10th It is in two hands written on some
scrap or TORN bit of paper to judge by the length of the lines


DOCUMENT SECOND

In Voltaires hand this part

Savoir sil est encore tems de declarer les billets quon a sur la
steure si on en specifie le numero dans la declaration

If it is still time to declare to announce in Saxony and demand
payment for Notes one holds on the Steuer If one is to specify the No
in the declaration

In Hirschs hand this part

lon peut declarer des billets sur la
steure quon a en depost en pays etranger et dont on ne pourra savoir
le numero que dans quinze jours ou trois SemainesKlein 259

One can declare Notes on the Steuer which one holds in deposit in
Foreign Countries and of which one cannot state the No till after a
fortnight or three weeks

Which of these Two was the Serpent which the Eve in this
STEUERSCHEIN Tree of Knowledge that grew in the middle of Paradise
remains entirely uncertain Hirsch of course says it was Voltaire
Voltaire not aware that DOCUMENT SECOND remained in existence
had denied that his Hirsch business was in any way concerned with
STEUERand must have been a good deal struck when DOCUMENT SECOND
came to light though what could he do but still deny Hirsch asserts
himself to have objected the illegality the Kings anger but that
Voltaire answered in hints about his favor with the King about his
power to make one a CourtJeweller if he liked and so at last
tempted the baby innocence of Hirschfor the rest admits that the
SteuerNotes were expected to yield a Profitof 35 per centand
in fact a dramatic reader can imagine to himself dialogue enough at
different times going on partly by words partly by hint innuendo
and dumbshow between this Pair of StageBeauties But for near a
fortnight after DOCUMENT FIRST there is nothing dated or that can be
clearly believedtill

MONDAY 23d NOVEMBER 1750 It is credibly certain the Jew Hirsch
came again this day to the Royal Schloss of Potsdam to Voltaires
apartment there right overhead of King Friedrichs it iswhere
after such dialogue as can be guessed at there was handed to Hirsch
by Voltaire in the form of Two negotiable Bills a sum of about 2250
pounds with which the Jew is to make at once for Dresden and
buy SteuerScheine Hirschs Narrative in Preface toTantale en
Procesp 340 SteuerScheine without fail but in talking or
corresponding on the matter we are always to call them FURS
or DIAMONDSmystery of mysteries being the rule for us This
considerable sum of 2250 pounds may it not otherwise contrives
Voltaire be called a Loan to Jeweller Hirsch so obliging a Jeweller
to buy Furs or Diamonds with At a gain of 35 per 100 Pieces there
will be above 800 pounds to me after all expenses cleared a very
pretty stroke of business doable in few days

Monday 23d November The beautiful Wilhelmina one remarks is just
making her packages right sad to end such a Visit as this had been
Thursday night from her first sleepingplace there is a touching
Farewell to her Brothertender melodiously sorrowful as the Song
of the Swan Wilhelmina to Friedrich Brietzen 26th November JOUR
FUNESTE POUR MOI OEuvres de Fredericxxvii i 197 To Voltaire
she was always good always liked Voltaire Voltaire would be saying
his Adieus in state among the others to that high Beingjust in the
hours while such a scandalous HirschConcoction went on underground

As to the Two Bills and Voltaires security for them readers are to
note as follows Bill FIRST is a Draft on Voltaires Paris Banker for
40000 livres about 1600 pounds not payable for some weeks This I
lend you Monsieur Hirsch mind LEND youto buy Furs Yes truly
what we call Fursand before the Bill falls payable there will be
effects for it in Monseigneur de Voltaires hand which is security
enough for Monseigneur The SECOND Bill againTruth is there were
in succession two Second Bills an INTENDEDSecond of this same Monday
23d which did not quite suit and an ACTUALSecond two days later
which did INTENDEDSecond Bill was one for 4000 thalers about 600
pounds drawn by Voltaire on the Sieur Ephraima very famous Jew
of Berlin now and henceforth with whom as moneychanger if not yet
otherwise which perhaps Ephraim thinks unlucky Voltaire it would
seem is in frequent communication This Bill Ephraim would not accept
told Hirsch he owed M de Voltaire nothing turned me rudely away
says Hirsch two of a trade and no friends he and Iso that there
is nothing to be said of this Ephraim Bill and except as it elucidates
some dark portions of the whirlpools need not have been noticed at all
Hirsch continues my Authority got only Two available Bills the
first on Paris for 1600 pounds payable in some weeks and after a day
or two this other The ACTUAL BILL SECOND which is a Draft for 4430
thalers about 650 pounds by old Father Hirsch head of the Firm on
Voltaire himselfFurs too with that Monsieur Hirsch at the rate
of 35 per piece you understand Yea truly MonseigneurDraft
accepted by Voltaire and the cash for it now handed to Hirsch Son the
only absolutely ready money he has yet got towards the affair

For these Two Bills especially for this Second I perceive Voltaire
holds borrowed jewels borrowed in theatrical times or partly bought
from the Hirsch Firm and not paid for which make him sure till he see
the STEUER Papers themselvesAnd now off my good Sieur Hirsch and
know that if you please ME there arethings in my power which would
suit a man in the Jeweller and Hebrew line Hirsch pushes home to
Berlin primed and loaded in this manner Voltaire naturally auxious
enough that the shot may hit Alas the shot will not even go off for
some time an ill omen

SUNDAY 29th NOVEMBER Hirsch we hear is still in Berlin Fancy the
humor of Voltaire after such a week as last TUESDAY December 1st
Hirsch still is not off Go you son of Amalek urges Voltaire and
sends his Servant Picard a very sharp fellow for perhaps the third
timewho has orders now as Hirsch discovers to stay with him not
quit sight of him till he do go Hirschs Narrative see Voltaires
Letter to DArget OEuvreslxiv 11 Hirschs hour of departure
for Dresden is not mentioned in the ACTS but I guess he could hardly
get over Wednesday with Picard dogging him on these terms and must
have taken the diligence on Wednesday night to arrive in Dresden about
December 4th Well at least our shot is off has not burst out and
lodged in our person herethanked be all the gods

Off sure enoughand what should we say if the whole matter were
already oozing out if on this same Sunday evening November 29th not
quite a weeks time yet the matter as we learn long afterwards had
been privately whispered to his Majesty That Voltaire has sent off
a Jew to buy SteuerScheine and has promised to get him made
CourtJeweller VoltaireOEuvreslxxiv 314 Letter to Friedrich
February 1751AFTER Catastrophe So within a week and before
Hirsch is even gone For men are very porous weighty secrets oozing out
of them like quicksilver through clay jars I could guess Hirsch
by way of galling insolent Ephraim had blabbed something and in the
course of five days it has got to the very Kingthis Kammerherr
Voltaire being such a favorite and famous man as never was the
very bullseye of all kinds of Berlin gossip in these days Hm
SteuerScheine and the Jew Hirsch to be CourtJeweller you say
thinks the King that Sunday night but locks the rumor in his Royal
mind he for his part or dismisses it as incredible There ought to
be impervious vessels too among the porous Voltaire notices nothing
particular or nothing that he speaks of as particular This must
have been a horrid week to him till Hirsch got away Hirsch is away
December 2d in Dresden safe enough but

But the fortnight that follows is conceivable as still worse Hirsch
writing darkly nothing to the purpose Voltaire driving often into
Berlin hearing from Ephraim hints about No connection with that
House If Monseigneur have intrusted Hirsch with moneymay there be
a good account of it and the like Black Care devouring Monseigueur
but nothing definite except the fact too evident That Hirsch does not
send or bring the smallest shadow of SteuerScheinePeltries or
Diamonds we meanor any value whatever for that Paris Bill of ours
payable shortly and which he has already got cashed in Dresden Nothing
but excuses prevarications stupid incoherently deceptive jargon
as of a mule intent on playing fox with you Vivid Correspondence is
conceivable but nothing of it definite to us except this sample
which we give translated

DOCUMENT THIRD torn fraction in Voltaires hand To Hirsch doubtless
early in December Not proper IL NE FALLAIT PAS to negotiate
Bills of Exchange and never produce a single diamondbit of peltry
or ware of any kind you son of Amalek Not proper to say I have got
money for your bills of exchange and I bring you nothing back and I
will repay your money when you shall no longer be here in Germany at
all Not proper to promise at 35 louis and then say 30 To say 30
and then next morning 25 You should at least have produced goods IL
FALLAIT EN DONNER at the price current very easy to do when one was
on the spot All your procedures have been faults hitherto Klein v
259

These are dreadful symptoms SteuerNotes promised at 35 discount are
not to be had except at 30 Say 30 then and get done with it mule of
a scoundrel Next day the 30 sinks to 25 and not a SteuerNote on any
terms comes to hand And the mule of a scoundrel has drawn money in
Dresden yonder for my Bill on Parisexcellent to him for trade of his
own What is to be done with such an Ass of Balaam He has got the bit
in his teeth it would seem Heavens he too is capable of stopping
short careless of spur and cudgel and miraculously speaking to a NEW
Prophet strange new Revealer of the Lords Will in modern dialect
in this enlightened Eighteenth Century itselfOne thing the new
Prophet can do protest his Paris Bill

DECEMBER 12th our next bit of certainty Voltaire writes haste
haste to Paris Dont pay and intimates to Hirsch You will have
to return your Dresden Banker his money for that Paris Bill At Paris
I have protested it mark me and there it never will be paid to him
or you And you must come home again instantly job undone lies not
untold you Hirsch with money in hand appears not to have wanted
for a briskish trade of his own in the Dresden marts But this of
cutting off his supplies brings him instantly backand at Berlin
DECEMBER 16th new facts emerge again of a definite nature

WEDNESDAY 16th DECEMBER 1750 Today the King with Court and
Voltaire come to Berlin for the Carnival Rodenbeck i 209 today
also Voltaire not in Carnival humor has appointed his Jew to meet
him In the Royal Palace itselfwe hope well remote from Friedrichs
Apartmentthis sordid conference needing ones choicest diplomacy
withal and such exquisite handling of bit and spur goes on And
probably at great length Of which as the FINALE and one clear
feature significant to the fancy here isfor record of what they call
COMPLETE SETTLEMENT which it was far from turning out to be


DOCUMENT FOURTH in Hirschs hand First Piece of it

Pour quittance generale promettant de rendre a Mr de Voltaire tous
billets ordres et lettres de change a moy donnez jusqua ce jour 16
Decembre 1750

Account all settled I promising to return M de
Voltaire all Letters Orders and Bills of Exchange given me to this day
16th December 1750

Hirsch signs But you have forgotten something Monsieur Hirsch
Whereuponet promets de donner a Mr de Voltaire dans le jour de
demain ou apres au plustard deux cent guatrevingt frederics dor au
lieu de deux cent quatrevingt louis dor que je lui ai payez le tout
pour quittance generale ce 16 Decembre 1750 a berlinAnd promise
to give M de Voltaire in the course of tomorrow or the day after
tomorrow at latest 280 FREDERICS DOR instead of 280 LOUIS DOR gold
FREDERICS the preferabe coin say experts which I have now paid him
whereby All will be settled

Hirsch again signs but has again forgotten something most important
thing Andje lui remettrai surtout les 40000 livres de billets de
change sur paris quil mavoit donnez et fiezI will especially return
him the Bill on Paris for 40000 livres 1600 pounds which he had
given and trusted to mebut has since protested as is too evident

And Hirsch signs for the last time Klein pp 258 260

Symptomatic surely of a haggly settlement these THREE shots instead
of oneVoltaires return is

Pour quittance generale de tout compte solde entre nous tout paye
au sieur abraham hersch a berlin 16 Decembre 1750Voltaire
Account all settled between us payment of the Sieur Abraham Hirsch in
full Berlin 16th Deember 1750

which Second Piece we perceive is to lie in Hirschs hand to keep
if he find it valuable

This COMPLETE SETTLEMENTlittle less than miraculous to Voltaire
and usone finds after sifting to have been the fruit of Voltaires
exquisite skill in treating and tuning his Hirsch no harshness of
rebuke rather some gleam of hope of future bargains help at Court
Your expenses compensation for protesting of that Bill on Paris Tush
cannot we make all that good In the first place I will BUY of you
these Jewels this one discovers to have been the essence of the
operation all or the best part of them which I have here in pawn for
Papas Bill 650 pounds was it not Well suppose I on the instant take
450 pounds worth or so of these Jewels I want a great many jewels
and you to pay me down a 200 or so of gold LOUIS as balancegold
LOUIS no we will say FREDERICS rather There now that is settled
Nothing more between us but settles itself if we continue friends
Upon which Hirsch walked home thankful for the good job in Jewels
wondering only what the Allowance for Expenses and Compensation will
be And Voltaire steps out newburnished into the Royal Carnival
splendors with a load rolled from his mind

This COMPLETE SETTLEMENT meanwhile rests evidently on two legs both
of which are hollow What will the handsome Compensation be I wonder
thinks Hirschand is horrorstruck to find shortly that Voltaire
considers 60 thalers about 9 pounds will be the fair sum More than
ten times that is Hirschs privately fixed idea On the other hand
Voltaire has been asking himself My 450 pounds worth of Jewels were
they justly valued though Jew Ephraim exaggerative and an enemy to
this Hirsch House answers Justly I would give from 300 pounds to 250
pounds for themSo that the legs both crumbling to powder Complete
Settlement crashes down into chaos and there ensuesBut we must
endeavor to be briefer

There ensues for about a week following such an inextricable scramble
between the Sieur Hirsch and M de Voltaire asas no reader not
himself in the JewBill line or paid for understanding it could
consent to have explained to him Voltaire by way of mending the bad
jewelbargain will buy of Hirsch 200 pounds worth more jewels gets
the new 200 pounds worth in hand cannot quite settle what articles will
suit This think you That think you And intricately shuffles them
about to Hirsch and back Hirsch singular to notice holds fast by
that Protested Paris Bill on frivolous pretexts always forgets to
bring that May have its uses that in a Court of Justice yet
Meetings there are almost daily in the Voltaire PalaceApartment
DECEMBER 19th and DECEMBER 24th there are Two DOCUMENTS which we must
spare the reader though he will hear of them again as highly notable
especially of one of them as notable in the extremeindicating the
abstrusest jewelbargainings scramblings rebargainings

My Jewels are truly valued asseverates Hirsch always Ephraim is my
enemy ask Herr Reklam chief Jeweller in Berlin an impartial man
The meetings are occasionally of stormy character Voltaires patience
nearly out But did nt I return you that Topaz Ring value 75 pounds
And you have NOT deducted it you One day Picard and he pulled a
Ring doubtless this Topaz off my finger says the pathetic Hirsch
and violently shoved me out of the room slamming their doorand
sent me home along the corridors in a very scurvy humor Thus under a
skin of second settlement there are two galvanic elements getting ever
more galvanic which no skin of settlement can prevent exploding before
long

Explosion there accordingly was most sad and dismal which rang through
all the Court circles of Berlin and like a sound of hooting and of
weeping mixed is audible over seas to this day But let not the reader
insist on tracing the course of it henceforth Klein though faithful
and exact is not a Pitaval and we find in him errors of the press The
acutest Actuary might spend weeks over these distracted Moneyaccounts
and inconsistent Lists of Jewels bought and not bought and would be
unreadable if successful Let us say The business catches fire at
this point the VoltaireHirsch theatre is as if blown up into mere
whirlwinds of igneous rum and smoky darkness Henceforth all plunges
into Lawsuit into chaos of conflicting liesundecipherable not worth
deciphering Let us give what few glimpses of the thing are clearly
discernible at their successive dates and leave the rest to picture
itself in the readers fancy

It appears that Meeting of DECEMBER 24th above alluded to was
followed by another on Christmasday which proved the final one Final
total explosion took place at this new meetingwhich we find farther
was at Chasots Lodging the CHAPEAU of Hanbury who is now in Town
like all the world for Carnival Hirsch does not directly venture on
naming Chasot but by implication by glimmers of evidence elsewhere
one sufficiently discovers that it is he LieutenantColonel Kings
Friend a man glorious especially ever since Hohenfriedberg and
that haul of the sixtyseven standards all at once In the way of
Arbitration Voltaire thinks Chasot might do something In regard to
those 450 pounds worth of bought Jewels there is not such a judge in
the world Hirsch says Next morning December 25th morrow after that
jumbly Account with probable slamming of the door and still worse
Voltaire went to a LieutenantColonel in the Kings service and ask
him to send for me Duvernet Second p 172 Hirschs Narrative
inTantalep 344 This is Chasot who knows these jewels well
Duvernetwho had talked a good deal with DArget in latter years and
alone of Frenchmen sometimes yields a true particle of feature in things
PrussianDuvernet tells us these Jewels were once Chasots own given
him by a fond Duchess of Mecklenburgmusical old Duchess verging
towards sixty HONI SOIT my friend What Hirsch gave Chasot for these
Jewels is not a doubtful quantity and may throw conviction into Hirsch
hopes Voltaire

DECEMBER 25th 1750 The interview at Chasots was not lengthy but it
was decisive Hirsch never brings that Paris Bill privately fixed
on that point Hirschs claims as we gradually unravel the intricate
mulemind of him rise very high indeed And as to the value of those
Jewels and what I allowed YOU for them Monsieur Chasot that is no
rule tradeprofits you knowNay the mule intimates as a last
shift That perhaps they are not the same Jewels that perhaps M de
Voltaire has changed some of them Whereupon the matter catches fire
irretrievably explodes M de Voltaires patience flies quite done and
fireeyed fury now guiding he springs upon the throat of Hirsch like a
catomountain clutches Hirsch by the windpipe tumbles him about the
room Infamous canaille do you know whom you have got to do with That
it is in my power to stick you into a hole underground for the rest
of your life Sirrah I will ruin and annihilate youand tossed me
about the room with his fist on my throat says Hirsch offering to
have pity nevertheless if I would take back the Jewels and return
all writings Narrative inTantale Eyes glancing like a
rattlesnakes as we perceive and such a phenomenon as Hirsch had not
expected this Christmas In short the matter has here fairly exploded
and is blazing aloft as a mass of intricate fuliginous ruin not to be
deciphered henceforth Such a scene for Chasot on the Christmasday at
Berlin And we have got to




PART II THE LAWSUIT ITSELF 30th December 175018th and 26th February
1751

Hirsch slunk hurriedly home uncertain whether dead or alive Old
Hirsch hearing of such explosion considered his house and family
ruined and being old and feeble took to bed upon it threatening
to break his heart Voltaire writes to Niece Denis on the morrow not
hinting at the Hirsch matter far from that but in uncommonly dreary
humor My splendor here my glory never was the like of it MAIS
MAIS BUT and ever again BUT at each new itemin fact the humor of
a glorious PhoenixPeacock suddenly douched and drenched in dirty water
and feeling frost at hand To Madame Denis lxxiv 279 Berlin
Palace 26th December 1750and ib 249 257 c of other dates
Humor intelligible enough when dates are compared

Better than that Voltaire is applying on all points of the compass to
Legal and Influential Persons for help in a Court of Law To Chancellor
Cocceji to Jarriges eminent Prussian Frenchman President of Court
to Maupertuis who knows Jarriges but will not meddle in a bad
businessat last even to dull reverend Formey whom he had not
called on hitherto Cocceji seems to have answered to the effect Most
certainly the Courts are wide openbut as to help December
30th the Suit Voltaire VERSUS Hirsch comes to Protocolthat is
Cocceji Jarriges Loper three eminent men have been named to try it
and Herr Hofrath Bell Advocate for Voltaire Plaintiff hands in his
First Statement that day Berlin resounds we may fancy how Rumor
laughter and wonder are in all polite quarters and continue more or
less vivid for above two months coming Here is one direct glimpse of
Plaintiff in this interim which we will give though the eyes are none
of the best The first visit I Formey had from Voltaire was in the
afternoon of January 8th 1751 Suit begun ten days ago I had at the
time a large party of friends Voltaire walked across the Apartment
without looking at anybody and taking me by the hand made me lead him
to a cabinet adjoining His Lawsuit with a Jew was the matter on hand
He talked to me at large about his Lawsuit and with the greatest
vehemence he wound up by asking me to speak to LawPresident M de
Jarriges since Chancellor I answered what was suitableprobably
did speak to Jarriges but might as well have held my tongue Voltaire
then took his leave stepping athwart the former Apartment with some
precipitation he noticed my eldest little girl then in her fourth
year who was gazing at the diamonds on his Cross of the Order of
Merit Bagatelles bagatelles MON ENFANT said he and disappeared
Formey i 232

On NewYears day Friday 1st January 1751 Voltaire had legally
applied to Herr Minister von Bismark for Warrant to arrest Hirsch as
a person that will not give up Papers not belonging to him Warrant was
granted and Hirsch lodged in Limbo Which worsens the state of poor old
Father Hirsch threatening now really to die of heartbreak and other
causes Hirsch Son from the interior of Limbo appeals to Bismark
Lord Chancellor Cocceji is seized of my Plea your gracious
LordshipAll the same answers Bismark produce CAUTION or you
cant get out Hirsch produces caution and gets out after a day or
twoand has been brought to Protocol January 4th No delay in this
Court both parties through their Advocates are now brought to book
the points they agree in will be sifted out and laid on this side as
truth what they differ in left lying on that side as a mixture of
lies to be operated on by farther processes and protocols

We will not detail the Lawsuitwhat I chiefly admire in it is its
brevity Cocceji has not reformed in vain Good Advocates none other
allowed and no Advocate talks he merely endeavors to think see and
discover holds his tongue if he can discover nothing that doubtless
is one source of the brevityMany lies are stated by Hirsch many by
Voltaire but the Judges without difficulty shovel these aside and
come step by step upon the truth Hirsch says plainly He was sent to
buy STEUERSCHEINE at 35 per cent discount Voltaire entirely denies
the SteuerNotes says It was an affair of Peltries and Jewelries
originating in loans of money to this ungrateful Jew Which necessitates
much wriggling on the part of M de Voltairebut he has himself
written in a Lawyers Office in his young days and knows how to
twist a turn of expression The Judges are not there to judge
about SteuerNotes but they give you to understand that Voltaires
PeltryandJewelry story is moonshine Hirsch produces the Voltaire
Scraps of Writing already known to our readers Voltaire says
Mere extinct jottings which Hirsch has furtively picked out of the
grateor may be said to have picked Papers annihilated by our
Bargain of December 16th and which should have been in the grate if
they were not this felon never having kept his word in that respect
Peltries and Jewelries I say he will not give me back that Paris
Bill which was protested pays me the other 3000 crowns Draft of 650
pounds in Jewels overvalued by halfJewels furtively changed since
Plaintiff had them of me answers Hirschand the steady Judges keep
their sieves going

The only Documents produced by Voltaire are Two of 19th DECEMBER and of
24th DECEMBERwhich the reader has not yet seen but ought now to gain
some notion of if possible They affect once more as that of December
16th had done to be Final Settlements or Final Settlement of 19th
with CODICIL of 24th and turn on confused Lists of Jewels bought
returned rebought that Topaz ring torn from ones hand a
conspicuous item which no reader would have patience to understand
except in the succinct form Let all readers note them howeverat
least the first of them that of December 19th especially the words we
mark in Italics which have merited a sad place for IT in the history
of human sin and misery Klein has given both Documents in engraved
facsimile we must help ourselves by simpler methods Berlin December
19th 1750 Voltaire writes Hirsch signsand the Italics are believed
to be words foisted in by M de Voltaire weeks after while the Hirsch
pleadings were getting stringent Reada very sad memorial of M de
Voltaire

DOCUMENT FIFTH in Voltaires hand written at two times and the old
writing MENDED in parts to suit the newFOR PAYMENT OF 3000
THALERS BY ME DUE I have sold to M de Voltaire at the price
costing by estimation and tax with 2 per cent for my commission OR
GRATIFICATION written above the following Diamonds taxed blotted
into TAXABLE as here adjoined vizseven pieces of jewelry
pendeloques c with price affixed among which is the violated
Topazthe whole estimated by him him crossed out and ME written
over it being 3640 thalers Whereupon received from Monsieur de
Voltaire what is very strange not intelligible without study the sum
of 2940 thalers and he has given me back the Topaz with 60 crowns for
my troubleBerlin 19th December 1750 Hitherto in Voltaires hand
after which Hirsch writes APROUVE A Hirschel Sic that is always
his SIGNATURE Abraham HirschEL so given by Klein while Klein and
everybody CALL him Hirsch STAG as we have doneif only to save a
syllable on the bad bargain And between these two lines  1750
and APPROVED there is crushed in as afterthought VALUED BY
MYSELF Hirschs self 2940 ADD 60 IS 3000 And in fine below
the Hirsch signature on what may be called the bottom margin there
isI think avowedly Voltaires and subsequentthis NB that
Hirschs valuing of all the jewels present lot and former lot is by
real estimation between twice and thrice too high of which it is
hoped your Lordships will take notice

Was there ever seen such a Paper one end of it contradicting the other
Payment TO M de Voltaire and payment BY M de Voltairewith other
blottings and foistings which print and italics will not represent
Hirsch denies he ever signed this Paper Is not that your writing then
APROUVE A HirschelNo and they convict him of falsity in that
respect the signature IS his but the Paper has been altered since he
signed it That is what the poor dark mortal meant to express and in
his mulish way he has expressed into a falsity what was in itself a
truth There is not on candid examination of Kleins Facsimiles and
the other evidence the smallest doubt but Voltaire altered added and
intercalated in his own privacy those words which we have printed in
italics TAXES changed into TAXABLES estimated at into estimable
at HIM for ME and so on and above all the now first line of the
Paper FOR PAYMENT OF 3000 THALERS BY ME DUE and in last line
the words VALUED BY MYSELF c are palpable interpolations sheer
falsifications which Hirsch is made to continue signing after his back
is turned

No fact is more certain and few are sadder in the history of M de
Voltaire To that length has he been driven by stress of Fortune Nay
when the Judges not hiding their surprise at the form of this Document
asked Will you swear it is all genuine Voltaire answered Yes
certainlyfor what will a poor man not do in extreme stress of
Fortune Hirsch as a Jew is not permitted to make oath where a
QuasiChristian will swear to the contrary or he gladly would and
might justly The Judges willing to prevent chance of perjury did not
bring Voltaire to swearing but contrived a way to justice without that

FEBRUARY 18th 1751 the Court arrives at a conclusion Hirschs
Diamonds whatever may have been written or forged are not nor
were worth more than their value think the Judges The Paris Bill is
admitted to be Voltaires not Hirschs continue theyand if Hirsch
can prove that Voltaire has changed the Diamonds not a likely fact
let him do so The rest does not concern us And to that effect on the
above day runs their Sentence You Hirsch shall restore the Paris
Bill mutual Papers to be all restored or legally annihilated Jewels
to be valued by sworn Experts and paid for at that price Hirsch if he
can prove that the Jewels were changed has liberty to try it in a new
Action Hirsch for falsely denying his Signature is fined ten thalers
thirty shillings such lie being a contempt of court whatever more

Ha fined you Jew Villain hysterically shrieks Voltaire in the
wrong werent you then and fined thirty shillings hysterically
trying to believe and make others believe that he has come off
triumphant Beaten my Jew havent I says he to everybody though
inwardly well enough aware how it stands and that he is a Phoenix
douched and has a tremor in the bones Chancellor Cocceji was far
from thinking it triumphant to him Here is a small Note of Coccejis
addressed to his two colleagues Jarriges and Loper which has been
found among the Law Papers

BERLIN 20th FEBRUARY 1751 The Herr President von Jarriges and
PrivyCouncillor Loper are hereby officially requested to bring the
remainder of the Voltaire Sentence to its fulfilment I am myself not
well and can employ my time much better The Herr von Voltaire has
given in a desperate Memorial EIN DESPERATES MEMORIAL to this purport
I swear that what is charged to me believed of me in the Sentence is
true and now request to have the Jewels valued I have returned
him this Paper with notice that it must be signed by an
AdvocateCOCCEJI Klein 256

So wrote Chancellor Cocceji on the Saturday washing his hands of this
sorry business Voltaire is ready to make desperate oath if needful We
said once M de Voltaire was not given to lying far the reverse
But yet see if you drive him into a corner with a sword at his
throatalas yes he will lie a little Forgery lay still less in his
habits but he can do a stroke that way too one stroke unique in his
life I do believe if a wild boar with frothy tusks is upon him
Tell it not in Gathexcept for scientific purposes And be judicial
arithmetical in passing sentence on it not shrieky mobbish and
flying off into the Infinite

Berlin of course is loud on these matters The man whom the King
delighted to honor this is he then King Friedrich has quitted Town
some while ago returned to Potsdam January 30th Glad enough
I suppose to be out of all this unmusical blowing of catcalls and
indecent exposure To Voltaire he has taken no notice silently leaves
Voltaire in his nook of the Berlin Schloss till the foul business get
done VOLTAIRE FILOUTE LES JUIFS picks Jew pockets writes he once
to Wilhelmina will get out of it by some GAMBADE summerset
writes he another time but 31st December 1750 OEuvres de
Fredericxxvii i 198 3d February 1751 ib 201And takes
the matter with boundless contempt doubtless with some vexation but
with the minimum of noise as a Royal gentleman might Jew Hirsch is
busy preparing for his new desperate Action getting together proof that
the Jewels have been changed In proof Jew Hirsch will be weak but in
pleading in public pamphlets and keeping a winged Apollo fluttering
disastrously in such a mudbath Jew Hirsch will be strong Voltaire
out of magnanimous pity to him consents next week to an Agreement
Agreement is signed on Thursday 26th February 1751Papers all to
be returned Jewels nearly all except one or two paid at Hirschs own
price Whereby on the whole as Klein computes Voltaire lost about 150
poundselsewhere I have seen it computed at 187 pounds not the least
matter which Old Hirsch has died in the interim Of broken heart
blubbers the Son day not known

And on these terms Voltaire gets out of the business glad to close
the intolerable rumor at some cost of money For all tongues were
wagging and in defect of a TIMES Newspaper it appears there had
Pamphlets come out printed Satires bound or in broadsidesapid
exhilarative for a season and interesting to the idle mind Of which
TANTALE EN PROCES may still for the sake of that PREFACE to it be
considered to have an obscure existence And such reduced to its
authenticities was the Adventure of the SteuerNotes A very bad
Adventure indeed unspeakably the worst that Voltaire ever tried who
had such talent in the finance line On which poor History is really
ashamed to have spent so much time sorting it into clearness in the
disgust and sorrow of her soul But perhaps it needed to be done Let
us hope at least it may not now need to be done again Besides the
KLEIN the TANTALE EN PROCES and the Voltaire LETTERS cited above there
is inOEuvres de Voltairelxiv pp 61106 as SUPPLEMENT there
written offhand in the very thick of the Hirsch Affair a considerable
set of NOTES TO DARGET which might have been still more elucidative
but are in their present dateless topsyturvied condition a very
wonder of confusion to the studious reader

This is the FIRST ACT of Voltaires TragicFarce at the Court of Berlin
readers may conceive to what a bleared frostbitten condition it
has reduced the first Favonian efflorescence there He considerably
recovered in the SECOND ACT such the indelible charm of the Voltaire
genius to Friedrich But it is well known the First Act rules all
the others and here accordingly the Third Act failed not to prove
tragical Out of First Act into Second the following EXTRACTS OF
CORRESPONDENCE will guide the reader without commentary of ours

Voltaire left languishing at Berlin has fallen sick now that all is
overno doubt in part really sick the unfortunate PhoenixPeafowl
with such a tremor in his bonesand would fain be near Friedrich and
warmth again fain persuade the outside world that all is sunshine with
him Voltaires Letters to Friedrich if he wrote any in this Jew time
are lost here are Friedrichs Answers to Twoone lost which had
been written from Berlin AFTER the Jew affair was out of Court and to
another not lost after the Jew affair was done


1 KING FRIEDRICH TO VOLTAIRE AT BERLIN

POTSDAM 24th February 1751 I was glad to receive you in my house I
esteemed your genius your talents and acquirements and I had reason to
think that a man of your age wearied with fencing against Authors and
exposing himself to the storm came hither to take refuge as in a safe
harbor

But on arriving you exacted of me in a rather singular manner Not
to take Freron to write me news from Paris and I had the weakness or
the complaisance to grant you this though it is not for you to decide
what persons I shall take into my service DArnaud had faults towards
you a generous man would have pardoned them a vindictive man hunts
down those whom he takes to hating In a word though to me DArnaud had
done nothing it was on your account that he had to go You were
with the Russian Minister speaking of things you had no concern with
Russian Excellency Gross off home lately in sudden dudgeon like an
angry skyrocket nobody can guess why Adelung vii 133 about 1st
December 1750and it was thought I had given you Commission You
have had the most villanous affair in the world with a Jew It has made
a frightful scandal all over Town And that SteuerSchein business is so
well known in Saxony that they have made grievous complaints of it to
me

For my own share I have preserved peace in my house till your
arrival and I warn you that if you have the passion of intriguing and
caballing you have applied to the wrong hand I like peaceable composed
people who do not put into their conduct the violent passions of
Tragedy In case you can resolve to live like a Philosopher I shall
be glad to see you but if you abandon yourself to all the violences of
your passions and get into quarrels with all the world you will do me
no good by coming hither and you may as well stay in Berlin Preuss

Chapter VIII OSTFRIESLAND AND THE SHIPPING INTERESTS

Two Foreign Events following on the heel of the Hirsch Lawsuit were of
interest to our Berlin friends though not now of much to us or anybody
April 5th 1751 the old King of Sweden Landgraf of HessenCassel
died whereby not only our friend Wilhelm the managing Landgraf
becomes Landgraf indeed if he should ever turn up on us again but
Princess Ulrique is henceforth Queen of Sweden her Husband the
new King No doubt a welcome event to Princess Ulrique the high
braveminded Lady but which proved intrinsically an empty one not to
say worse than empty to herself and her friends in times following
Friedrichs connection with Sweden which he had been tightening lately
by a Treaty of Alliance came in the longrun to nothing for him on the
Swedish side and on the Russian has already created umbrages kindled
abstruse suspicions indignationsRussian Excellency Gross abruptly
at Berlin demanding horses not long since and posting home without
other leavetaking to the surprise of mankindRussian Czarina
evidently in the sullens against Friedrich this long while dull
impenetrable clouds of anger lodging yonder boding him no good All
which the Accession of Queen Ulrique will rather tend to aggravate than
otherwise Adelung vii 205 Accession of Adolf Friedrich ib 133
Grosss sudden Departure

The Second Foreign Event is English about a week prior in date and
is of still less moment March 31st 1751 Prince Fred the Royal
HeirApparent has suddenly died Had been ill more or less for an
eight days past was now thought better though still coughing and
bringing up phlegmwhen on Wednesday night between nine and ten
in some lengthier fit of that kind he clapt his hand on his breast and
the terrified valet heard him say JE SUIS MORTand before his
poor Wife could run forward with a light he lay verily dead Walpole
GEORGE THE SECOND i 71 The Rising Sun in England is vanished
then Yes and with him his MOONS and considerable moony workings and
slushings hither and thither which they have occasioned in the muddy
tidecurrents of that Constitutional Country Without interest to us
here or indeed elsewhereexcept perhaps that our dear Wilhelmina
would hear of it and have her sad reflections and reminiscences
awakened by it sad and manyvoiced perhaps of an almost doleful
nature being on a sickbed at this time poor Lady She quitted Berlin
months ago as we observedher farewell Letter to Friedrich written
from the first stage homewards and melodious as the voice of sorrowful
true hearts to us and him dates November 24th just while Voltaire
whom she always likes and in a beautiful way protects FRERE
VOLTAIRE as she calls him was despatching Hirsch on that illomened
Predatory STEUERMission Her Brother is in real alarm for Wilhelmina
about this time sending out Cothenius his chief Doctor and the like
but our dear Princess reemerges from her eclipse and we shall see her
again several times if we be lucky

And so poor Fred is endedand sulky people ask in their cruel way
Why not A poor dissolute flabby fellowcreature with a sad destiny
and a sadly conspicuous too Could write Madrigals be set to make
Opposition cabals Read this sudden Epitaph in doggerel an uncommonly
successful Piece of its kind which is now his main monument with
posterity The Brother hero of Culloden the Sister Amelia
our Friedrichs first love now growing gossipy and spiteful poor
Princess are old friends

 Here lies Prince Fred
 Who was alive and is dead
 Had it been his Father
 I had much rather
 Had it been his Brother
 Sooner than any other


 Had it been his Sister
 Theres no one would have missed her
 Had it been his whole generation
 Best of all for the Nation
 But since its only Fred
 Theres no more to be said Walpole i 436




FRIEDRIAH VISITS OSTFRIESLAND

A thing of more importance to us two months after that catastrophe in
London is Friedrichs first Visit to OstFriesland May 31st having
done his BerlinPotsdam Reviews and other current affairs Friedrich
sets out on this Excursion With OstFriesland for goal but much
business by the way Towards Magdeburg and a short visit to the
Brunswick Kindred first of all There is much reviewing in the
Magdeburg quarter and thereafter in the Wesel and reviewing and
visiting all along through Minden Bielfeld Lingen not till July
13th does he cross the OstFriesland Border and enter Embden His
three Brothers and Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick were with him

who gives a foolish German myth of Voltaires being passed off for the
Kings Baboon c Voltaire not being there at all On catching view
of OstFriesland Border see on the BorderLine what an Arch got
on its feet Triumphal Arch of frondent ornaments inscriptions and
insignia of quite extraordinary magnificence Arch which sets
every one into the agreeablest admiration Above a hundred such
Arches spanned the road at different points multitudinous enthusiasm
reverently escorting more than 20000 by count till we enter Embden
where all is cannonsalvo and threetimesthree the thundershots
continuing above 2000 of them from the walls not to speak of
response from the ships in harbor Embden glad enough as would appear
and OstFriesland glad enough to see their new King July 13th 1751
after waiting above six years

Next day his Majesty gave audience to the new Asiatic Shipping
Company of which anon to the Stande and Magisterial personswith
many questions I doubt not about your new embankments new
improvements prospects there being much procedure that way in all
manner of kinds since the new Dynasty came in now six years ago
Embankments on your River wide spaces changed from ooze to meadow on
the Dollart still more which has lain 500 years hidden from the
sun Does any reader know the Dollart OstFriesland has awakened to
wonderful new industries within these six years urged and guided by
the new King who has great things in view for it besides what are in
actual progress

That of dikes seaembankments for example to OstFriesland as to
Holland they are the first condition of existence and in the past
times of extreme Parliamentary vitality have been slipping a good deal
out of repair Ems River in those flat rainy countries has ploughed
out for itself a very wide embouchure as boundary between Groningen
and OstFriesland Muddy Ems bickering with the German Ocean does not
forget to act if Parliamentary Commissioners do These dikes 120
miles of dike mainly along both banks of this muddy Ems River are now
watertight again to the comfort of flax and clover and this is but
one item of the diking now on foot Readers do not know the Dollart
that uppermost round gulf not far from Embden itself in the waste
embouchure of Ems with its continents of mud and tide Five hundred
years ago that ugly whirl of muddy surf 100 square miles in area was
a fruitful field 50 Villages upon it one Town several Monasteries
and 50000 souls till on Christmas midnight AD 1277 the winds and
the stormrains having got to their height Ocean and Ems did about
midnight undermine the place folded it over like a friable bedquilt
or monstrous doomed griddlecake and swallowed it all away Most of
it they say that night the whole of it within ten years coming
BuschingErdbeschreibungv 845 846 Preuss i 308 309and
there it has hung like an unlovely GOITRE at the throat of Embden
ever since One little dot of an Island with six houses on it near
the Embden shore is all that is left Where probably his Majesty landed
July 15th being in a Yacht that day but did not see afar off the
sunk steepletop which is fabled to be visible at lowwater

Upon this Dollart itself there is now to be diking tried Kings
DomainKammer showing the example Which Official Body did accordingly
without BlueBooks but in good working case otherwise break
ground few months hence and victoriously achieved a POLDER or Diked
Territory worth about 2000 pounds annually which in 1756 was
sold to the STANDE at twentyfive years purchase let us say or for
50000 pounds An example of a convincing nature which many others and
ever others have followed since to gradual considerable diminution of
the Dollart and relief of OstFriesland on this side Furtherance of
these things is much a concern of Friedrichs The second day after his
arrival those audiences and ceremonials done Friedrich and suite got
on board a Yacht and sailed about all over this Dollart twenty miles
out to sea dined on board and would have if the weather was bright
which I hope a pleasantly edifying day The harbor is much in need
of dredging the building docks considerably in disrepair but shall
be refitted if this King live and prosper He has declared Embden a
FreeHaven inviting trade to it from all peaceable Nationsand
readers do not know though Sir Jonas Hanway and the jealous mercantile
world well did what magnificent Shipping Companies and SeaEnterprises
of his devising are afoot there Of which one word and no second
shall follow

September 1st 1750 those Carrousel gayeties scarce done The Asiatic
Trading Company stept formally into existence Embden the Headquarters
of it Patent or FREYHEITSBRIEF inHeldenGeschichteiii 457
458 chief Manager a Ritter De la Touche one of the Directors
our fantastic Bielfeld thus turned to practical value A Company
patronized in all ways by the King but for the rest founded not on
his money founded on voluntary shares which to the regret of Hanway
and others have had much popularity in commercial circles Will trade
to China A thing looked at with umbrage by the English by the Dutch
A shame that English people should encourage such schemes says
Hanway Which nevertheless many Dutch and many English private persons
doamong the latter one English Lady name unknown but I always
suspect Miss Barbara Wyndham of the College Salisbury concerning
whom there will be honorable notice by and by

At the time of Friedrichs visit the Asiatic Company is in full vogue
making ready its first ship for Canton First ship KONIG VON PREUSSEN
tons burden not given actually sailed 17th February next 1752 and
was followed by a second named TOWN OF EMBDEN on the 19th of September
following both of which prosperously reached Canton and prosperously
returned with cargoes of satisfactory profit The first of them KONIG
VON PREUSSEN had been boarded in the Downs by an English Captain
Thomson and his Frigate and detained some daystill Thomson took
Seven English seamen out of her Act of Parliament express said
his Grace of Newcastle Which done Thomson found that the English
jealousies would have to hold their hand no farther whatever ones
wishes may be

Nay within a year hence January 24th 1753 Friedrich founded another
Company for India BENGALISCHE HANDELSGESELLSCHAFT which also sent
out its pair of ships perhaps oftener than once and pointed as the
other was doing to wide fields of enterprise for some time But
luck was wanting And in part mismanagement and in whole the
SevenYears War put an end to both Companies before long Friedrich is
full of these thoughts among his other Industrialisms and never quits
them for discouragement but tries again when the obstacles cease to
be insuperable Ever since the acquisition of OstFriesland the
furtherance of SeaCommerce had been one of Friedrichs chosen objects
Let us carry our own goods at least Silesian linens Memel timbers
stockfish what need of the Dutch to do it And in many branches his
progress had been remarkableespecially in this carrying trade while
the War lasted and crippled all AntiEnglish belligerents Upon which
indeed and the conduct of the English Privateers to him there is a
Controversy going on with the English Court in those years began
in 1747 most distressful to his Grace of Newcastlewhich in part
explains those stingy procedures of Captain Thomson Home you
seven English sailors when the first Canton ship put to sea That
Controversy is by no means ended after three years but on the contrary
after two years more comes to a crisis quite shocking to his Grace
of Newcastle and defying all solution on his Graces sidethe other
Party after such delays five years waiting having settled it for
himself Of which were the crisis come we will give some account

On the third day of his Visit Friedrich drove to Aurich the seat
of Government and official little capital of OstFriesland where
triumphal arches joyful reverences concourses demonstrations
sumptuous Dinner one item awaited his Majesty I know not if in the
way thither or back he passed those Three huge Oaks or the rotted
stems or roots of them under which the Ancient Frisians Lords of all
between Weser and Rhine were wont to assemble in Parliament WITHOUT
Fourth Estate or any Eloquence except of the purely Business sortor
what his thoughts on the late OstFriesland Bandbox Parliaments may
have been He returned to Embden that night and on the morrow started
homewards we may fancy tolerably pleased with what he had seen

King Friedrichs main Objects of Pursuit in this Period says a
certain Author whom we often follow I define as being Three 1
Reform of the Law 2 Furtherance of Husbandry and Industry in all
kinds especially of Shipping from Embden 3 Improvement of his own
Domesticities and Household Enjoymentsrenewal of the Reinsberg
Program in short

In the First of these objects continues he King Friedrichs success
was very considerable and got him great fame in the world In his
Second head of efforts that of improving the Industries and Husbandries
among his People his success though less noised of in foreign parts
was to the near observer still more remarkable A perennial business
with him this which even in the time of War he never neglects and
which springs out like a stemmed flood whenever Peace leaves him free
for it His labors by all methods to awaken new branches of industry
to cherish and further the old are incessant manifold unwearied and
will surprise the uninstructed reader when he comes to study them
An airy poetizing bantering lightly brilliant King supposed to be
serious mainly in things of War how is he moiling and toiling like
an evervigilant LandSteward like the most industrious City Merchant
hardestworking Merchants Clerk to increase his industrial Capital by
any the smallest item

One day these things will deserve to be studied to the bottom and to
be set forth by writing hands that are competent for the instruction
and example of Workersthat is to say of all men Kings most of all
when there are again Kings At present I can only say they astonish me
and put me to shame the unresting diligence displayed in them and the
immense sumtotal of themwhat man in any the noblest pursuit can
say that he has stood to it sixandforty years long in the style of
this man Nor did the harvest fail slow sure harvest which sufficed
a patient Friedrich in his own day harvest now in our day visible to
everybody in a Prussia all shooting into manufactures into commerces
opulencesI only hope not TOO fast and on more solid terms than are
universal at present Those things might be didactic truly in various
points to this Generation and worth looking back upon from its
high LAISSEZFAIRE altitudes its triumphant Scriptransactions and
continents of goldnuggetspleasing it doubts not to all the gods
To write well of what is called Political Economy meaning thereby
increase of moneysworth is reckoned meritorious and our nearest
approach to the rational sublime But to accomplish said increase in
a high and indisputable degree and indisputably very much by your own
endeavors wisely regulating those of others does not that approach
still nearer the sublime

To prevent disappointment I ought to add that Friedrich is the reverse
of orthodox in Political Economy that he had not faith in FreeTrade
but the reversenor had ever heard of those ultimate Evangels
unlimited Competition fair Start and perfervid Race by all the world
towards CHEAPANDNASTY as the likeliest winningpost for all the
world which have since been vouchsafed us Probably in the world there
was never less of a FreeTrader Constraint regulation encouragement
discouragement reward punishment these he never doubted were the
method and that government was good everywhere if wise bad only if not
wise And sure enough these methods where human justice and the earnest
sense and insight of a Friedrich preside over them have results which
differ notably from opposite cases that can be imagined The desperate
notion of giving up government altogether as a relief from human
blockheadism in your governors and their want even of a wish to be just
or wise had not entered into the thoughts of Friedrich nor driven
him upon trying to believe that such in regard to any Human Interest
whatever was or could be except for a little while in extremely
developed cases the true way of managing it How disgusting
accordingly is the Prussia of Friedrich to a Hanbury Williams who has
bad eyes and dirty spectacles and hates Friedrich how singular and
lamentable to a Mirabeau Junior who has good eyes and loves him
No knave no impertinent blockhead even can follow his own beautiful
devices here but is instantly had up or comes upon a turnpike strictly
shut for him Was the like ever heard of snarls Hanbury furiously as
an angry dog might in a labyrinth it sees not the least use for What
unspeakable want of libertyand reads to you as if he were lying
outright but generally is not only exaggerating tumbling upside down
to a furious degree knocking against the labyrinth HE sees not the
least use for Mirabeaus Gospel of FreeTrade preached in 1788
MONARCHIE PRUSSIENNE he calls it A LONDRES privately Paris 1788
8 vols 8vo which is a DeadSea of Statistics compiled by industrious
Major Mauvillon with this fresh current of a Gospel shining through
it very fresh and brisk of few yards breadthdedicated to Papa the
true PROTevangelist of the thinga comparatively recent Performance
though now some seventy or eighty years the senior of an English
unconscious Facsimile which we have all had the pleasure of
knowingwill fall to be noticed afterwards not by this Editor we
hope

Many of Friedrichs restrictive notionsas that of watching with such
anxiety that money gold or silver coin be not carried out of the
Countrywill be found mistakes not in orthodox Dismal Science as now
taught but in the nature of things and indeed the Dismal Science will
generally excommunicate them in the lumptoo heedless that Fact has
conspicuously vindicated the general sumtotal of them and declared it
to be much truer than it seems to the Dismal Science Dismal Science
if that were important to me takes insufficient heed and does not
discriminate between times past and times present times here and times
there

Certain it is King Friedrichs success in National Husbandry was very
great The details of the very many new Manufactures new successful
everspreading Enterprises fostered into existence by Friedrich his
Canalmakings Roadmakings Bogdrainings Colonizings and unwearied
endeavorings in that kind will require a Technical Philosopher one day
and will well reward such study and trouble of recording in a human
manner but must lie massed up in mere outline on the present occasion
Friedrich as LandFather Shepherd of the People was great on the
Husbandry side also and we are to conceive him as a man of excellent
practical sense doing unweariedly his best in that kind all his life
long Alone among modern Kings his late Father the one exception and
even his Father hardly surpassing him in that particular

In regard to Embden and the Shipping interests OstFriesland awakened
very ardent speculations which were a novelty in Prussian affairs
nothing of Foreign Trade except into the limited Baltic had been heard
of there since the Great Electors time The Great Elector had ships
Forts on the Coast of Africa and tried hard for Atlantic Tradeout of
this same Embden where being summoned to protect in the troubles he
had got some footing as Contingent Heir withal and kept a Prussian
Battalion a good while And now on much fairer terms not less
diligently turned to account it is his GreatGrandsons turn
Friedrichs successes in this department the rather as Embden and
OstFriesland have in our time ceased to be Prussian are not much worth
speaking of but they connect themselves with some points still slightly
memorable to us How for example his vigilantes and endeavors on this
score brought him into rubbings not collisions but jealousies and
gratings with the English and Dutch the reader will see anon

Lawreform is gloriously prosperous Husbandry the like and Shipping
Interest itself as yet But in the Third grand Head that of realizing
the Reinsberg Program beautifying his Domesticities and bringing his
own Hearth and Household nearer the Ideal Friedrich was nothing like
so successful in fact had no success at all That flattering Reinsberg
Program it is singular how Friedrich cannot help trying it by every
new chance nor cast the notion out of him that there must be a kind
of MusesHeaven realizable on Earth That is the Biographic Phenomenon
which has survived of those Years and to that we will almost
exclusively address ourselves on behalf of ingenuous readers




Chapter IXSECOND ACT OF THE VOLTAIRE VISIT

Voltaires Visit lasted in all about Thirtytwo Months and is
divisible into Three Acts or Stages The first we have seen how
it commenced in brightness as of the sun and ended by that Hirsch
business in whirlwinds of smoke and sootVoltaire retiring on his
passionate prayer to that silent Countryhouse which he calls the
Marquisat there to lie in hospital and wash himself a little and let
the skies wash themselves

The Hirsch business having blown over as all things do Voltaire
resumed his place among the CourtPlanets and did his revolutions
striving to forget that there ever was a Hirsch or a sootexplosion of
that nature In words nobody reminded him of it the King least of all
and by degrees matters were again tolerably glorious and all might have
gone well enough though the primal perfect splendor such fuliginous
reminiscence being ineffaceable never could be quite reattained The
diamond Cross of Merit the Chamberlain gold Key hung bright upon the
man a man the admired of men He had work to do work of his own which
he reckoned priceless that immortal SIECLE DE LOUIS QUATORZE which
he stood by and honestly did while here the one fixed axis in those
fooleries and whirlings of hiswork for the King two hours
one hour a day which the King reckoned priceless in its sort For
Friedrich himself Voltaire has with touches of real love coming out
now and then a very sincere admiration mixed with fear and delights
in shining to him and being well with him as the greatest pleasure now
left in life Besides the King he had society enough French in type
and brilliant enough plenty of society or at his wish what was still
better none at all He was bedded boarded lodged as if beneficent
fairies had done it for him and for all these things no price asked
you might say but that he would not throw himself out of window Had
the man been wiseBut he was not wise He had if no big gloomy devil
in him among the bright angels that were there a multitude of ravening
tumultuary imps or little devils very ILLCHAINED and was lodged
he and his restless little devils in a skin far too thin for him and
them

Reckoning up the matter one cannot find that Voltaire ever could have
been a blessing at Berlin either for Friedrich or himself and it is to
be owned that Friedrich was not wise in so longing for him or clasping
him so frankly in his arms As Friedrich by this time probably begins
to discoverthough indeed to Friedrich the thing is of finite moment
by no means of infinite as it was to Voltaire At worst nothing but
a little money thrown away thinks Friedrich Sure enough this is a
strange Trismegistus this of mine star firework shall we call him or
terrestrial smokeandsoot work But one can fence oneself against the
blind vagaries of the man and get a great deal of good by him in the
lucid intervals To Voltaire himself the position is most agitating
but then its glories were there nothing more Besides he is always
thinking to quit it shortly which is a great sedative in troubles
What with intermittencies safe hidings in ones MARQUISAT or vacant
interlunar cave with alternations of offence and reconcilement what
with occasional actual flights to Paris whitherward Voltaire is always
busy to keep a postern open and of which there is frequent talk and
almost continual thought all along flights to be called visits
and privately intending to be final but never proving sothe
VoltaireFriedrich relation if left to itself might perhaps long have
staggered about and not ended as it did

But alas no relation can be left to itself in this worldespecially
if you have a porous skin There were other French here as well as
Voltaire revolving in the Courtcircle and that beyond all others
proved the fatal circumstance to him NE SAVEZVOUS PAS Dont you
know said he to Chancellor Jarriges one day that when there are two
Frenchmen in a Foreign Court or Country one of them must die FAUT QUE
LUN DES DEUX PERISSE Seyfarth ii 191 c c Which shocked the
mind of Jarriges but had a kind of truth too Jew Hirsch run into for
low smuggling purposes had been a Cape of Storms difficult to weather
but the continual leeshore were those Frenchwith a heavy gale on and
one of the rashest pilots He did strike the breakers there at last
and it is well known total shipwreck was the issue Our Second Act
holding out dubiously in continual perils till Autumn 1752 will have
to pass then into a Third of darker complexion and into a Catastrophe
very dark indeed

Catastrophe which by farther ill accident proved noisy in the extreme
producing worldwide shrieks from the one party stonesilence from the
other which were answered by unlimited hooting catcalling and hahaing
from all parts of the WorldTheatre upon both the shrieky and the
silent party catcalling not fallen quite dead to this day To Friedrich
the catcalling was not momentous being used to such things though to
poor Voltaire it was unlimitedly soand to readers interested in this
memorable Pair of Men the rights and wrongs of the Affair ought to
be rendered authentically conceivable now at last Were it humanly
possibleafter so much catcalling at random Smelfungus has a right to
say speaking of this matter

Never was such a jumble of loudroaring ignorances delusions and
confusions as the current Records of it are Editors especially French
Editors treating of a Hyperborean Cimmerian subject like this are
easygoing creatures And truly they have left it for us in a wonderful
state Dateless much of it by nature and by the lazy Editors
MISdated into very chaos jumbling along there in mad defiance of top
and bottom often the very Year given wrongfull everywhere of lazy
darkness irradiated only by stupid rages illdirected mockeriesand
for issue cheerfully malicious hootings from the general mob of
mankind with unbounded contempt of their betters which is not
pleasant to see When mobs do get together round any signal object and
editorial gentlemen with talent for it pour out from their respective
barrelheads in a persuasive manner instead of knowledge ignorance
set on fire they are capable of carrying it farWill it be possible
to pick out the small glimmerings of real light from this mad dance of
willowisps and fireflies thrown into agitation

It will be very difficult my friendwhy did not you yourself do it
Most true those actual VoltaireFriedrich LETTERS of the time are
a resource and pretty much the sole one Letters a good few still
extant which all HAD their bit of meaning and have it still if well
tortured till they give it out or give some glimmer of it outbut
you have not tortured them you have left it to me if I would As
I assuredly will not never fear readerexcept in the thriftiest
degree




DETACHED FEATURES NOT FABULOUS OF VOLTAIRE AND HIS BERLINPOTSDAM
ENVIRONMENT IN 17511752

To the outside crowd of observers and to himself in good moments
Voltaire represents his situation as the finest in the world

Potsdam is Sparta and Athens joined in one nothing but reviewing and
poetry day by day The Algarottis the Maupertuises are here have each
his work serious for himself then gay Supper with a King who is a
great man and the soul of good company Sparta and Athens I tell
you a Camp of Mars and the Garden of Epicurus trumpets and violins
War and Philosophy I have my time all to myself am at Court and in
freedomif I were not entirely free neither an enormous Pension nor
a Gold Key tearing out ones pocket nor a halter LICOU which they
call CORDON of an ORDER nor even the Suppers with a Philosopher who
has gained Five Battles could yield me the least happiness
OEuvreslxxiv 325 326 333 Letters to DArgental and others
27th April8th May 1751 Looked at by you my outside friendsah
had I health and YOU here what a situation

But seen from within it is far otherwise Alongside of these warblings
of a heart grateful to the first of Kings there goes on a series
of utterances to Niece Denis remarkable for the misery driven into
meanness that can be read in them Illhealth discontent vague
terror suspicion that dare not go to sleep a strange vague terror
shapeless or taking all shapesa body diseased and a mind diseased
Fear quaking continually for nothing at all is not to be borne in a
handsome manner And it passes often enough in these poor LETTERS
into transient malignity into gusts of trembling hatred with a
tendency to relieve oneself by private scandal of the house we are in
Seldom was a miserabler wrongside seen to a bit of royal tapestry A
man hunted by the little devils that dwell unchained within himself
like Pentheus by the Maenads like Actaeon by his own Dogs Nay without
devils with only those terrible bowels of mine and scorbutic gums
it is bad enough Glorious promotions to me here sneers he bitterly
but one thing is indisputable I have lost seven of my poor residue of
teeth since I came In truth we are in a sadly scorbutic state and
that and the devils we lodge within ourselves is the one real evil
Could not Suspicionwhy cannot shetake her natural rest and all
these terrors vanish Oh M de VoltaireThe practical purport to
Niece Denis always is Keep my retreat to Paris open in the name of
Heaven no obstruction that way

Miserable indeed a man fatally unfit for his present element But he
has Two considerable Sedatives all along two and no third visible
to me Sedative FIRST that he can at any time quit this illustrious
TartarusElysium the envy of mankindand indeed practically he is
always as if on the slip thinking to be off shortly for a time or in
permanence can be off at once if things grow too bad Sedative SECOND
is far better His own labor on LOUIS QUATORZE which is steadily going
on and must have been a potent quietus in those Courtwhirlwinds inward
and outward

From Berlin already in Autumn 1750 Voltaire writes to DArgental
I shant go to Italy this Autumn nor ever in my life as I had
projected But I will come to see YOU in the course of November far
from it I got into STEUERSCHEINE thenAnd again after some
weeks I have put off my journey to Italy for a year Next Winter too
therefore I shall see you on the road thither To my Country since
you live in it I will make frequent visits very Italy and the
King of Prussia are two old passions with me but I cannot treat
FredericleGrand as I can the Holy Father with a mere look in
passing To DArgental Berlin 14th SeptemberPotsdam 15th
October 1750 OEuvreslxxiv 220 237 Let this one to which
many might be added serve as sample of Sedative First or the power and
intention to be off before long

In regard to Sedative Second again The happiest circumstance is
brought with me all my LOUISFOURTEENTH Papers and Excerpts I get
from Leipzig if no nearer whatever Books are needed and labor
faithfully at this immortal Production Yes day by day to see growing
by the cunning of ones own right hand such perennial SolomonsTemple
of a SIECLE DE LOUIS QUATORZEwhich of your Kings or truculent
TiglathPilesers could do that To poor me even in the Potsdam
tempests it is possible what ugliest day is not beautiful that sees
a stone or two added thereDaily Voltaire sees himself at work on his
SIECLE on those fine terms trowel in one hand weapon of war in the
other And does actually accomplish it in the course of this Year
1751with a great deal of punctuality and severe painstaking which
readers of our day fallen careless of the subject are little aware of
on Voltaires behalf Voltaires reward was that he did NOT go mad in
that Berlin element but had throughout a boweranchor to ride by The
King of France continues me as Gentleman of the Chamber say you but
has taken away my Title of Historiographer That latter however shall
still be my function My present independence has given weight to my
verdicts on matters Probably I never could have written this Book at
Paris A consolation for ones exile MON ENFANT To Niece Denis
OEuvreslxxiv 247 c c 28th October 1750 and subsequent
dates

It is proper also to observe that besides shining at the Kings Suppers
like no other Voltaire applies himself honestly to do for his Majesty
the small work required of himthat of Versecorrecting now and then
Two Specimens exist two Pieces criticised ODE AUX PRUSSIENS and THE
ART OF WAR portions of that Reprint now going on to the extent of
Twelve Copieswoe lies in one of them most unexpected at this time
AU DONJON DU CHATEAUunder benefit of Voltaires remarks Which
one reads curiously not without some surprise InOEuvres de
Fredericx 276303 Surprise first at Voltaires official fidelity
his frankness rigorous strictness in this small duty then at the kind
of correcting instructing and lessoning that had been demanded of him
by his Royal Pupil Mere grammatical stylistic skindeep work nothing
or at least in these Specimens nothing of attempt upon the interior
structure or the interior harmony even of utterance solely the
Parisian niceties graces laws of poetic language the FAS and the
NEFAS in regard to all that this is what his Majesty would fain be
taught from the fountainheadone wonders his Majesty did not learn
to spell which might have been got from a lower sourceAnd all this
Voltaire does teach with great strictness For example in the very
first line in the very first word set before him

PRUSSIENS QUE LA VALEUR CONDUISIT A LA GLOIRE so Friedrich had
written ODE AUX PRUSSIENS which is specimen First and thus Voltaire
criticises The Hero here makes his PRUSSIENS of two syllables and
afterwards in another strophe he grants them three A King is master
of his favors At the same time one does require a little uniformity
and the IENS are usually of two syllables as LIENS SILESIENS
AUTRICHIENS excepting the monosyllables BIEN RIENEnough enoughA
severe punctual painstaking Voltaire sitting with the schoolmasters
bonnet on head ferula visible if not actually in hand For which as
appears his Majesty was very grateful to the Trismegistus of men

Voltaires flatteries to Friedrich in those scattered little Billets
with their snatches of verse are the prettiest in the worldand
approach very near to sincerity though seldom quite attaining it
Something traceable of false of suspicious feline nearly always in
those seductive warblings which otherwise are the most melodious
bits of idle ingenuity the human brain has ever spun from itself For
instance this heading of a Note sent from one room to anotherperhaps
with pieces of an ODE AUX PRUSSIENS accompanying

 Vou gui daignez me departir
 Les fruits dune Muse divine
 O roi je ne puis consentir
 Que sans daigner men avertir
 Vous alliez prendre medecine
 Je suis votre maladene
 Et sur la casse et le sene
 Jai des notions non communes
 Nous sommes de mene metier
 Fautil de moi vous defier
 Et cacher vos bonnes fortunes

Was there ever such a turn given to taking physic Still better is this
other the topic worseHAEMORRHOIDS a kind of annual or periodical
affair with the Royal Patient who used to feel improved after

 Ten or twelve verses on another point then suddenly

 Que la veine hemorroidale
 De votre personne royale
 Cesse de troubler le repos
 Quand pourraije dune style honnete
 Dire Le cul de mon heros
 Va tout aussi bien que sa tete
 InOEuvres de Fredericxxii 283 267

A kittenish grace in these things which is pleasant in so old a cat

Smelfungus says He is a consummate Artist in Speech our Voltaire
that if you take the word SPEECH in its widest sense and consider the
much that can be spoken and the infinitely more that cannot and should
not is Voltaires supreme excellency among his fellowcreatures never
rivalled to my poor judgment anywhere before or sincenor worth
rivalling if we knew it well

Another fine circumstance is that Voltaire has frequent leave of
absence and in effect passes a great deal of his time altogether by
himself or in his own way otherwise What with Friedrichs Review
Journeys and Business Circuits considerable separations do occur of
themselves and at any time Voltaire has but to plead illness which he
often does with ground and without and get away for weeks safe
into the distance more or less remote He is at the Marquisat as
we laboriously make out at Berlin in the empty Palace perhaps in
Lodgings of his own though one would prefer the GRATIS method nursing
his maladies which are many writing his LOUIS QUATORZE lonely
altogether your Majesty and sad of humoryet giving his cosy
little dinners and running out pretty often if well invited into the
brilliancies and gayeties No want of brilliant social life here
which can shine more or less and appreciate ones shining The Kings
SupperpartiesYes and these though the brightest are not the only
bright things in our PotsdamBerlin world Take with you reader one
or two of the then and there Chief Figures Voltaires fellowplayers
strutting and fretting their hour on that Stage of Life They are mostly
not quite strangers to you

We know the sublime Perpetual President in his red wig and sublime
supremacy of Pure Science A gloomy set figure affecting the
sententious the emphatic and a composed impregnabilitylike the Jove
of Science With immensities of gloomy vanity not compressible at all
times Friedrich always strove to honor his Perpetual President and
duly adore the Pure Sciences in him but inwardly could not quite manage
it though outwardly he failed in nothing Impartial witnesses confess
the King had a great deal of trouble with his gloomings and him Who is
this Voltaire gloomily thinks the Perpetual President to himself A
fellow with a nimble tongue that is all Knows nothing whatever of Pure
Sciences except what fraction or tincture he has begged or stolen from
myself And here is the King of the world in raptures with him

Voltaire from of old had faithfully done his kowtows to this King of
the Sciences and with a sort of terror had suffered with incredible
patience a great deal from him But there comes an end to all things
Voltaires patience not excepted It lay in the fates that Maupertuis
should steadily accumulate day after day and now more than ever
heretofore upon the sensitive Voltaire Till as will be seen the
sensitive Voltaire could endure it no longer but had to explode upon
this big Bully accident lending a spark to go off like a Vesuvius of
crackers fireserpents and skyrockets envelop the red wig and much
else in delirious conflagrationand produce the catastrophe of this
Berlin Drama

DArgens poor dissolute creature is the best of the French lot He has
married after so many temporary marriages with Actresses one Actress
in permanence Mamsell Cochois a patient kind being and settled now
at Potsdam here into perfectly composed household life Really loves
Friedrich they say the only Frenchman of them that does Has abundance
of light sputtery wit and Provencal fire and ingenuity no illnature
against any man Never injures anybody nor lies at all about anything
A great friend of fine weather regrets of his inheritances in
Provence chiefly one item and this not overmuchthe bright southern
sun Sits shivering in wintertime wrapping himself in more and more
flannel two dressinggowns two nightcapsloyal to this King in good
times and in evil

Was the Kings friend for thirty years helped several meritorious
people to his Majestys notice and never did any man a mischief in that
quarter An erect guileless figure very tall with vivid countenance
chaotically vivid mind full of bright sallies irregular ingenuities
had a hot temper too which did not often run away with him but
sometimes did He thrice made a visit to Provencein fact ran away
from the King feeling bantered and roasted to a merciless degreebut
thrice came back At the end of the first stage he had always
privately forgiven the King and determined that the pretended visit
should really be a visit only Reads the Kings Letters which
are many to him always bareheaded in spite of the draughts
NicolaiAnekdoteni 1175 c c

Algarotti is too prudent politely egoistic and selfcontained to take
the trouble of hurting anybody or get himself into trouble for love or
hatred He fell into disfavor not long after that unsuccessful little
mission in the first Silesian War of which the reader has lost
remembrance Good for nothing in diplomacy thought Friedrich but
agreeable as company Company in tents in the seat of War has its
unpleasantness thought Algarottiand began very privately sounding
the waters at Dresden for an eligible situation so that there has
ensued a quarrel since then humble apologies followed by profound
silencetill now there is reconcilement It is admitted Friedrich had
some real love for Algarotti Algarotti as we gather none at all for
him but only for his greatness They parted again February 1753
without quarrel but for the last time AlgarottiCorrespondence
OEuvres de Fredericxviii 86and I confess to a relief on the
occasion

Friedrich readers know by this time had a great appetite for
conversation he talked well listened well one of his chief enjoyments
was to give and receive from his fellowcreatures in that way I hope
and indeed have evidence that he required good sense as the staple
but in the form he allowed great latitude He by no means affected
solemnity rather the reverse goes much upon the bantering vein far
too much according to the complaining parties Took pleasure cruel
mortal in stirring up his company by the whip and even by the whip
applied to RAWS for we find he had established like the Dublin
HackneyCoachman raws for himself and habitually plied his implement
there when desirous to get into the gallop In an inhuman manner said
the suffering Cattle who used to rebel against it and go off in the
sulks from time to time It is certain he could especially in his
younger years put up with a great deal of zanyism ingenious foolery
and rough tumbling if it had any basis to tumble on though with years
he became more saturnine

By far his chief Artist in this kind indeed properly the only one was
La Mettrie whom we once saw transiently as ArmySurgeon at Fontenoy he
is now out of all that flung out with the dogs at his heels has been
safe in Berlin for three years past Friedrich not only tolerates the
poor madcap but takes some pleasure in him madcap we say though poor
La Mettrie had remarkable gifts exuberant laughter one of them and
was far from intending to be mad Not Zanyism but Wisdom of the highest
nature was what he drove atunluckily with open mouth and mind all
in tumult La Mettrie had left the Army soon after that busy Fontenoy
evening Chivalrous Grammont his patron and protector who had saved
him from many scrapes lay shot on the field La Mettrie rushing on
with mouth open and mind in tumult had from of old been continually
getting into scrapes Unorthodox to a degree the Sorbonne greedy
for him long since such his audacities in print his heavy hits
boisterous quizzical logical And now he had set to attacking the
Medical Faculty to quizzing Medicine in his wild way Doctor Astruc
Doctor This and That of the first celebrity taking it very ill So
that La Mettrie had to demit to get out of France rather in a hurry
lest worse befell

He had studied at Leyden under Boerhaave He had in fact considerable
medical and other talent had he not been so tumultuous and
openmouthed He fled to Leyden and shot forth in safety there his
fiery darts upon Sorbonne and Faculty at his own discretionwhich was
always a MINIMUM quantityhe had before long made Leyden also too
hot for him His Books gained a kind of celebrity in the world awoke
laughter and attention among the adventurous of readers astonishment
at the blazing madcap a BON DIABLE too as one could see and are
still known to Cataloguemakersthough with one exception LHOMME
MACHINE not otherwise nor read at all LHOMME MACHINE Man a Machine
is the exceptional Book smallest of Duodecimos to have so much wildfire
in it This MAN A MACHINE though tumultuous La Mettrie meant nothing
but openmouthed Wisdom by it gave scandal in abundance so that even
the Leyden Magistrates were scandalized and had to burn the afflicting
little Duodecimo by the common hangman and order La Mettrie to
disappear instantly from their City

Which he had to dotowards King Friedrich usual refuge of the
persecuted seldom inexorable where there was worth even under bad
forms recognizable and not a friend to burning poor men or their
books if it could be helped La Mettrie got some post like DArgets
or still more nominal readership some small pension to live upon
and shelter to shoot forth his wildfire when he could hold it no
longer fire not of a malignant incendiary kind but pleasantly
lambent though maddish as Friedrich perceived Thus had La Mettrie
found a Goshenand stood in considerable favor at Court and in Berlin
Society in the years now current According to Nicolai Friedrich never
esteemed La Mettrie which is easy to believe but found him a jester
and ingenious madcap out of whom a great deal of merriment could be
had over wine or the like To judge by Nicolais authentic specimen
their Colloquies ran sometimes pretty deep into the cynical under
showers of wildfire playing about and the highjinks must have been
highish Anekdotenvi 197227 When there had been enough of
this Friedrich would lend his La Mettrie to the French Excellency
Milord Tyrconnel to oblige his Excellency and get La Mettrie out
of the way for a while Milord is at Berlin a Jacobite Irishman of
blusterous Irish qualities though with plenty of sagacity and rough
sense likes La Mettrie and is not much a favorite with Friedrich

Tyrconnel had said at firstwhen Rothenburg privately from
Friedrich came to consult him What are in practical form those
assistances from the Most Christian Majesty should we MAKE
Alliance with him as your Excellency proposes and chance to be
attackedMORBLEU assistance enough enumerating several MAIS
MORBLEU SI VOUS NOUS TROMPEX VOUS SEREZ ECRASES if you deceive us
you will be squelched Valori ii 130 c He had been chosen
for his rough tongue says Valori our French Court being piqued at
Friedrich and his sarcasms Tyrconnel gives splendid dinners Voltaire
often of them does not love Potsdam nor is loved by it Nay I
sometimes think a certain DEMON NEWSWRITER of whom by and by but do
not know may be some hungry Attache of Tyrconnels Hungry Attache
shut out from the divine Suppers and upper planetary movements and
reduced to look on them from his cold hutch in a doglike angry and
hungry manner His flying allusions to Voltaire SON Friedrichs
SQUELETTE DAPOLLON skeleton of an Apollo and the like are barkings
almost rabid

Of the military sort about this time Keith and Rothenburg appear
most frequently as guests or companions Rothenburg had a great deal of
Friedrichs regard Winterfeld is more a practical Counseller and does
not shine in learned circles as Rothenburg may A fiery soldier too
this Rothenburg withala man probably of many talents and qualities
though of distinctly decipherable there is next to no record of him or
them He had a Parisian Wife who is sometimes on the point of
coming with Niece Denis to Berlin and of setting up their two French
households there but never did it either of them to make an Uncle
or a Husband happy Rothenburg was bred a Catholic he headed the
subscription for the famous KATHOLISCHE KIRCHE so delightful to the
Pope and liberal Christians in those years but never gave a sixpence
of money says Voltaire once Catholic KIRK was got completed with
difficulty stands there yet like a large washbowl set bottom
uppermost on the top of a narrowish tub but none of Rothenburgs money
is in it In Voltaires Correspondence there is frequent mention of him
not with any love but with a certain secret respect rather inclined
to be disrespectful if it durst or could the eloquent vocal individual
not quite at ease beside the more silent thinking and acting one What
we know is Friedrich greatly loved the man There is some straggle of
CORRESPONDENCE between Friedrich and him left but it is worth nothing
gives no testimony of that or of anything else noticeableand that is
the one fact now almost alone significant of Rothenburg Much loved and
esteemed by the King employed diplomatically now and then perhaps
talked with on such subjects which was the highest distinction
Poor man he is in very bad health in these months has never rightly
recovered of his wounds and dies in the last days of 1751to the
bitter sorrow of the King as is still on record A highly respectable
dim figure far more important in Friedrichs History than he looks As
Kings guest he can in these months play no part

Highly respectable too and well worth talking to though left very dim
to us in the Books is Marshal Keith who has been growing gradually
with the King and with everybody ever since he came to these parts
in 1747 A man of Scotch type the broad accent with its sagacities
veracities with its steadfastly fixed moderation and its sly
twinkles of defensive humor is still audible to us through the foreign
wrappages Not given to talk unless there is something to be said but
well capable of it then Friedrich the more he knows him likes him
the better On all manner of subjects he can talk knowingly and with
insight of his own On Russian matters Friedrich likes especially to
hear himthough they differ in regard to the worth of Russian troops
Very considerable military qualities in those Russians thinks Keith
imperturbably obedient patient of a tough fibre and are beautifully
strict to your order on the paradeground or off Pooh mere rubbish
MON CHER thinks Friedrich always To which Keith unwilling to argue
too long will answer Well it is possible enough your Majesty may try
them some day if I am wrong it will be all the better for us Which
Friedrich had occasion to remember by and by Friedrich greatly respects

BERLIN 28th DECEMBER 1751 LOUIS QUATORZE AND DEATH OF
ROTHENBURGOur LOUIS QUATORZE is out But Heavens see your
Majesty a Pirate Printer at FrankfurtonOder has been going on
parallel with us all the while and here is his foul blotch of an
Edition on sale too Bielfeld fantastic fellow had proofsheets
Bielfeld sent them to a Professor there though I dont blame Bielfeld
result too evident Protect me your Majesty Order all wagons
especially wagons for Leipzig to be stopped to be searched and the
Books thrown outit costs you but a word

Quite a simple thing All Prussia to the rescue thinks an ardent
Proprietor of these Proofsheets But then next day hears that
Rothenburg is dead That the silent Rothenburg lay dying while the
vocal Voltaire was writing these fooleries to a King sunk in grief
Repent be sorry be ashamed he says to himself and does instantly
trybut with little success FrankfurtonOder with its Bielfeld
proofsheets still jangling along contemptibly audible for some time

on LOUIS QUATORZE as will be seenFriedrichs grief for Rothenburg
was deep and severe he had visited him that last night say the
Books and quitted his bedside silent and all in tears It is mainly
what of Biography the silent Rothenburg now has

From the current Narratives as they are called readers will recollect
out of this Voltaire Period two small particles of Event amid such an
ocean of noisy frothtwo and hardly more that of the OrangeSkin
and that of the Dirty Linen Let us put these two on their basis and
pass on

THE ORANGESKIN Potsdam 2d September 1751 to Niece DenisGood
Heavens MON ENFANT what is this I hear through the great
Dionysius Ear I maintain at such expense to myself La Mettrie
a man of no consequence who talks familiarly with the King after their
reading and with me too now and then La Mettrie swore to me that
speaking to the King one of those days of my supposed favor and the
bit of jealousy it excites the King answered him I shall want him
still about a yearyou squeeze the orange you throw away the skin ON
EN JETTE LECORCE Here is a pretty bit of babble lie most likely
and bit of mischievous fun from Dr Joyous It cannot be true No
And yetand yet Words cannot express the agonizing doubts the
questionings occasionally the horror of Voltaire poor sick soul
keeping a DionysiusEar to boot This blurt of La Mettries goes
through him like a shot of electricity through an elderly sick
HouseholdCat and he speaks of it again and ever againthough we will
not farther

DIRTY LINEN Potsdam 24th July 1752 To Niece Denis Maupertuis
has discreetly set the rumor going that I found the Kings Works very
bad that I said to some one on Verses from the King coming in
Will he never tire then of sending me his dirty linen to wash You
obliging Maupertuis

Rumor says it was General Mannstein once AidedeCamp in Russia
who had come to have his WORK ON RUSSIA revised excellent Work often
quoted by us Did get out at lastin England through Lord Marischal
and David Hume see PREFACE to it London 1760 when the
unfortunate Royal Verses came Perhaps M de Voltaire did say itwhy
not had it only been prudent He really likes those Verses much more
than I but knows well enough SUB ROSA what kind of Verses they
are This also is a horrible suspicion that the King should hear of
thisas doubtless the King did though without going delirious upon
it at all To Niece Denis dates as above OEuvres de

engaging ways he takes my dimensions harshly with his quadrant it is
said there enters something of envy into his DATA  A somewhat surly
gentleman not too sociable and truth to say considerably sunk here

 I endure Maupertuis not having been able to soften him In all
countries there are insociable fellows with whom you are obliged to
live though it is difficult He has never forgiven me foromitting to
cite him cAt Paris he had got the Academy of Sciences into trouble
and himself into general dislike DETESTER then came this Berlin
offer Old Fleuri when Maupertuis called to take leave repeated that
verse of Virgil NEC TIBI REGNANDI VENIAT TAM DIRA CUPIDO Fleuri might
have whispered as much to himself but he was a mild sovereign lord and
reigned in a gentle polite manner I swear to you Maupertuis does not
in his shop the Academy herewhere God be thanked I never go

He has printed a little Pamphlet on Happiness SUR LE BONHEUR it
is very dry and miserable Reminds you of Advertisements for things
lostso poor a chance of finding them again Happiness is not what
he gives to those who read him to those who live with him he is not
himself happy and would be sorry that others were to Niece Denis
this

 A very sweet life here Madame Madame dArgental an outside

Voltaire had dinnerparty Maupertuis one of them party still in the
drawingroom dinner just coming up President your Book SUR LE
BONHEUR has given me pleasure said Voltaire politely very politely
considering what we have just read given me pleasurea few
obscurities excepted of which we will talk together some evening
Obscurities said Maupertuis in a gloomy arbitrary tone There may
be such for you Monsieur Voltaire laid his hand on the Presidents
shoulder yellow wig near by looked at him in silence with
manytwinkling glance gayety the topmost expression but by no means
the sole one President I esteem you JE VOUS ESTIME MON PRESIDENT

Friedrichs Answers to these Voltaire Letters if he wrote any are all
gone Probably he answered almost nothing what we have of his relates
always to specific business receipt of LOUIS QUATORZE and the like
and is always in friendly tone Handsomely keeping Silence for Two Here
is a snatch from him on neutral figures and movements of the time

FRIEDRICH TO WIILHELMINA November 17th 1751I think the Margraf of
Anspach will not have stayed long with you He is not made to taste the
sweets of society his passion for hunting and the tippling life he
leads this long time throw him out when he comes among reasonable
persons I expect my Sister of Brunswick with the Duke and their
eldest Girl the 4th of next monthto Carnival here It is seven
years since the Queen our Mamma has seen her She holds a small
Board of Wit at Brunswick of which your Doctor Doctor Superville
DutchFrench whose perennial merit now is That he did not burn
Wilhelminas MEMOIRS but left them safe to posterity for long
centuriesof which your Doctor is the director and oracle You would
burst outright into laughing when she speaks of those matters Her
natural vivacity and haste has not left her time to get to the bottom of
anything she skips continually from one subject to the other and
gives twenty decisions in a minute OEuvres de Fredericxxvii i

About a month before Rothenburgs death which was so tragical to
Friedrich there had fallen out with a hideous dash of farce in it the
death of La Mettrie Here are Two Accounts by different handswhich
represent to us an immensity of babble in the then Voltaire circle

LA METTRIE DIESTwo Accounts 1 King Friedrichs to Wilhelmina
21st November 1751 We have lost poor La Mettrie He died for a
piece of fun ate out of banter a whole pheasantpie had a horrible
indigestion took it into his head to have blood let and convince the
German Doctors that bleeding was good in indigestion But it succeeded
ill with him he took a violent fever which passed into putrid and
carried him off He is regretted by all that knew him He was gay BON
DIABLE good Doctor and very bad Author by avoiding to read his Books
one could manage to be well content with himself Ib xxvii i 203

2 Voltaires to Niece Denis NOT his first to her Potsdam 24th
December 1751 No end to my astonishment Milord Tyrconnel always
ailing died here himself sends to ask La Mettrie to come and see
him to cure him or amuse him The King grudges to part with his Reader
who makes him laugh La Mettrie sets out arrives at his Patients just
when Madame Tyrconnel is sitting down to table he eats and drinks
talks and laughs more than all the guests when he has got crammed EN A
JUSQUAU MENTON they bring him a pie of eagle disguised as pheasant
which had arrived from the North plenty of bad lard porkhash and
ginger in it my gentleman eats the whole pie and dies next day at Lord
Tyrconnels assisted by two Doctors Cothenius and Lieberkuhn whom
he used to mock at How I should have liked to ask him at
the article of death about that Orangeskin OEuvres de
Voltairelxxiv 439 450

Add this trait too from authentic Nicolai to complete the matter An
Irish Priest Father Macmahon Tyrconnels Chaplain more power to him
wanted to convert La Mettrie he pushed into the sickroomencouraged
by some who wished to make La Mettrie contemptible to Friedrich the
charitable souls La Mettrie would have nothing to do with this Priest
and his talk who however still sat and waited La Mettrie in
a twinge of agony cried out JESUS MARIE AH VOUS VOILA ENFIN
RETOURNE A CES NOMS CONSOLATEURS exclaimed the Irishman To which La
Mettrie answered in polite language to the effect Bother you and
expired a few minutes after NicolaiAnekdoteni 20 n

Enough of this poor madcap Friedrichs ELOGE of him read to the
Academy some time after it was generally thought and with great
justice might as well have been spared The Piece has nothing noisy
nothing untrue but what has it of importance And surely the subject
was questionable or more La Mettrie might have done without Eulogy
from a King of men

 He had been used to put himself at once on the most familiar
footing with the King says Thiebault UNbelievable Entered the Kings
apartment as he would that of a friend plunged down whenever he liked
which was often and lay upon the sofas if it was warm took off
his stock unbuttoned his waistcoat flung his periwig on the
floor Thiebault v 405 calls him La Metherie knows as usual
nothinghighly probable thinks stupid Thiebault

The truth is says Nicolai the King put no real value on La Mettrie
He considered him as a merryandrew fellow who might amuse you when
half seasover ENTRE DEUX VINS De la Mettrie showed himself unworthy
of any favor he had Not only did he babble and repeat about Town what
he heard at the Kings table but he told everything in a false way
and with malicious twists and additions This he especially did at Lord
Tyrconnel the then French Ambassadors table where at last he died
NicolaiAnekdoteni 20 But could not take the ORANGESKIN along
with him alas no

On the whole be not too severe on poor Voltaire He is very fidgety
noisy something of a pickthank of a wheedler but above all he
is scorbutic dyspeptic hagridden as soul seldom was and in his
oblique way APPEALS to Friedrich and usnot in vain And in
short we perceive after the First Act of the Piece beginning in
preternatural radiances ending in whirlwinds of flaming soot he has
been getting on with his Second Act better than could be expected
Gyrating again among the bright planets circumjovial moons in
the Court Firmament is again in favor and mightAlas he had his
FELLOWmoons his Maupertuis above all Incurable that Maupertuis
misery gets worse and worse steadily from the first day No smallest
entity that intervenes not even a wandering La Beaumelle with his Book
of PENSEES but is capable of worsening it Take this of Smelfungus
this Pair of Cabinet Sketcheshasty outlines extant chiefly he
declares by Voltaires blame

LA BEAUMELLEVoltaire has a fatal talent of getting into I quarrels
with insignificant accidental people and instead of silently with
cautious finger disengaging any bramble that catches to him and
thankfully passing on attacks it indignantly with potent steel
implements woodaxes waraxes brandishing and hewingtill he
has stirred up a whole wilderness of bramblebush and is himself
bramblechips all over M Angliviel de la Beaumelle for example
was nothing but a bramble some conceited Licentiate of Theology
who finding the Presbytery of Geneva too narrow a field had gone to
Copenhagen as Professor of Rhetoric or some such thing and finding
that field also too narrow and not to be widened by attempts at
Literature MES PENSEES and the like in such barbarous Countryhad
now end of 1751 come to Berlin and has Presentation copies of MES
PENSEES OU LE QUEN DIRATON flying right and left in hopes of doing
better there Of these PENSEES Thoughts so called I will give but
one specimen another that of King Friedrich a common man
being carefully suppressed in the Berlin Copies of La Beaumelles
distributing

There have been greater Poets than Voltaire there was never any so
well recompensed and why Because Taste GOUT inclination sets no
limits to its recompenses The King of Prussia overloads men of talent
with his benefits for precisely the reasons which induce a little German
Prince to overload with benefits a buffoon or a dwarf OEuvres de
Voltairexxvii 220 n Could there be a phenomenon more indisputably
of bramble nature

He had no success at Berlin in spite of his merits could not come
near the King at all but assiduously frequented Maupertuis the
flower of human thinkers in that erawho was very humane to him in
consequence How is it O flower of human thinkers that I cannot get
on with his Majesty or make the least way HELAS MONSIEUR you have
enemies answered he of the red wig and told La Beaumelle hear it ye
Heavens That M de Voltaire had called his Majestys attention to
the PENSEE given above one evening at Supper Royal heard it myself
Monsieurhusht Upon which

Upon which see paltry La Beaumelle has become my enemy for life
shrieks Voltaire many times afterwards And it was false I declare
to Heaven and again declare it was not I it was DArgens quizzing
me about it that called his Majestys attention to that PENSEE of
Blockhead La Beaumelleyou treacherous Perpetual President stirring
up enemies against me and betraying secrets of the Kings table
Sorrow on your red wig and youIt is certain La Beaumelle soon after
this left Berlin not in love with Voltaire And there soon appeared
at FranfurtonMayn a Pirate Edition of our brandnew SIECLE DE LOUIS
QUATORZE with Annotations scurrilous and flimsyLa Beaumelle the
professed Perpetrator who received for the job 7 pounds 10s net
Ib xx asseverates the wellinformed Voltaire Oh M de Voltaire
and why not leave it to him then Poor devil he got put into the
Bastille too by and by Royal Persons being touched by some of his
stupid footnotes

La Beaumelle had a long course of it up and down the world in and
out of the Bastille writing much with inconsiderable recompense and
always in a wooden manure worthy of his First vocation in the Geneva
time A man of pleasing physiognomy says Formey and expressed
himself well I received his visit 14th January 1752to which latter
small circumstance welcome as a fixed date to us here La Beaumelles
Biography is now pretty much reduced for mankind Formey ii 221 He
continued Maupertuiss adorer and was not a bad creature only a dull
wooden one with obstinate temper A LIFE OF MAUPERTUIS of his writing
was sent forth lately Vie de Maupertuiscited above Paris
1866 after lying hidden a hundred years but it is dull dead
painfully ligneous like all the rest and of new or of pleasant tells
us nothing

His enmity to M de Voltaire did prove perpetuala bramble that might
have been dealt with by fingers or by fingers and scissors but could
not by axes and their hewing and brandishing This is the ninetyfifth
anonymous Calumny of La Beaumelles this that you have sent me says
Voltaire once The first stroke or two had torn the bramble quite
on end He says he will pursue you to Hell even writes one of the
Voltaire kind friends from Frankfurt on that 7 pounds 10s business A
LENFER answers M de Voltaire with a toss Well I should think so
he and at a good rate of speed But whether he will find me there must
be a question If you want to have an insignificant accidental fellow
trouble you all your days this is the way of handling him when he first
catches hold

ABBE DE PRADESDe Prades Abbe de Prades Reader to the King
though happily not an enemy of Voltaires is in some sort La
Beaumelles counterpart or brother with a difference concerning
whom also one wants only to know the exact date of his arrival As La
Beaumelle felt too straittied in the Geneva vestures where it had
been good for him to adjust himself and stay so did De Prades in
the Sorbonne dittoand burst out on taking Orders not into eloquent
Preachings or edifying Devotional Exercises but into loud blurts of
mere heresy and heterodoxy Blurts which were very loud and I believe
very stupid which failed of being sublime even to the Philosophic
world and kindled the Sorbonne into burning his Book and almost
burning himself had not he at once run for it

Ran to Holland and there continued blurting more at largedecidedly
stupid for most part thinks Voltaire but with glorious Passages
worth your Majestys attentionupon which DAlembert too helping
poor De Prades was invited to the Readership vacant by La Mettries
eaglepie and came gladly and stayed At what date one occasionally
asks for there are Royal Letters dateless but written in his hand
that raise such question in the utter dimness otherwise Date is
September 1752 Preuss i 368 ii 115 Farther question one does
not ask about De Prades Rather an emphatic intrusive kind of fellow
I should guesswrote he not Friedrich that ABRIDGMENT OF PLEURYS
ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY and other the like dreary Pieces which used to
be inflicted on mankind as Friedrichs

For the rest having place and small pensionnot like La Beaumelle
obliged to pirate and annotate for 7 pounds 10she went on steadily a
good while got a Canonry of Glogau small Catholic benefice bad if
it was not better than its now occupantand unluckily in the
SevenYearsWar time fell into treasonous Correspondence with his
countrymen which it was feared might be fatal when found out But no
not fatal Friedrich did lock him in Magdeburg for some months then let
him out Home to Glogau sirrah stick to your Canonry henceforth and
let us hear no more of you at all Which shall be his fate in these
pages also

Good my friend no more of him then Only recollect September 1752
if dateless Royal Letters in De Pradess hand turn up




Chapter X DEMON NEWSWRITER OF 1752

It must be owned the Kings French Colony of Wits were a sorry set of
people They tempt one to ask What is the good of wit then if this
be it Here are people sparkling with wit and have not understanding
enough to discern what lies under their nose Cannot live wisely with
anybody least of all with one another

In fact it is tragic to think how ill this King succeeded in the matter
of gathering friends With the whole world to choose from one fancies
always he might have done better But no he could notand chiefly for
this reason His love of Wisdom was nothing like deep enough reverent
enough and his love of ESPRIT the mere Garment or Phantasm of Wisdom
was too deep Friends do not drop into ones mouth One must know how
to choose friends and that of ESPRIT though a pretty thing is by
no means the one requisite if indeed it be a requisite at all This
present Wit Colony was the best that Friedrich ever had and we may all
see how good it was He took at last more and more into bantering his
TableCompanions which I do not wonder at as the chief good he could
get of them And had as we said especially in his later time in the
manner of Dublin HackneyCoachmen established upon each animal its
RAW and makes it skip amazingly at touch of the whip Cruel mortal
thought his cattlebut after all how could he well help it with
such a set

Native Literary Men German or Swiss there also were about Friedrichs
Court of them happily he did not require ESPRIT but put them into his
Academy or employed them in practical functions where honesty and
good sense were the qualities needed Worthy men several of these
but unmemorable nearly all We will mention Sulzer aloneand not for
THEORIES and PHILOSOPHIES OF THE FINE ARTS Allgemeine Theorie der
Schonen Kunste3 vols c c which then had their multitudes of
readers but for a Speech of Friedrichs to him once which has
often been repeated Sulzer has a fine rugged wholesome SwissGerman
physiognomy both of face and mind and got his admirations as the
Berlin HUGH BLAIR that then was a Sulzer whom Friedrich always rather
liked

Friedrich had made him School Inspector loved to talk a little with
him about business were it nothing else Well Monsieur Sulzer how
are your Schools getting on asked the King one daylong after this
but nobody will tell me exactly when though the fact is certain enough
How goes our Education business Surely not ill your Majesty and
much better in late years answered SulzerIn late years why
Well your Majesty in former time the notion being that mankind were
naturally inclined to evil a system of severity prevailed in schools
but now when we recognize that the inborn inclination of men is
rather to good than to evil schoolmasters have adopted a more generous
procedureInclination rather to good said Friedrich shaking his
old head with a sad smile Alas dear Sulzer ACH MEIN LIEBER SULZER
I see you dont know that damned race of creatures ER KENNT NICHT DIESE
VERDAMMTE RACE as I do Nicolai iii 274the thing appears to
have been said in French JE VOIS BIEN MON CHER SULZER QUE VOUS
NE CONNAISSEZ PAS COMME MOI CETTE RACE MAUDITE A LAQUELLE NOUS
APPARTENONS but the German form is irresistibly attractive and is
now heard proverbially from time to time in certain mouths Here is
a speech for youPardon the King who was himself so beneficent and
excellent a King cry several Editors of the rosepink type This
present Editor for his share will at once forgive but how can he ever
forget

Perhaps I mistake owns Voltaire in his Pasquinade of a VIE PRIVEE
but it seems to me at these Suppers there was a great deal of ESPRIT
real wit and brilliancy going The King had it and made others have
and what is extraordinary I never felt myself so free at any table
Conversation most pleasant testifies another most instructive
animated not to be matched I should guess elsewhere in the world
Bielfeld LETTERS Voltaire Vie Privee Very sprightly indeed and a
fund of good sense a basis of practicality and fact necessary to be
in it withal though otherwise it can foam over if some La Mettrie be
there and a good deal of wine in him to very great heights




A DEMON NEWSWRITER GIVES AN IDEA OF FRIEDRICH INTELLIGIBLE TO THE
KNOWING CLASSES IN ENGLAND AND ELSEWHERE

Practically I can add only That these Suppers of the gods begin
commonly at halfpast eight Concert just over and last till towards
midnightnot later conveniently as the King must be up at five in
Summertime at four and needs between five and six hours of sleep
Or would the reader care to consult a Piece expressly treating on all
these points kind of MANUSCRIPT NEWSPAPER fallen into my hands
which seems to have had a widish circulation in its day IDEE DE LA
PERSONNE DE LA MANIERE DE VIVRE ET DE LA COUR DU ROI DE PRUSSE juin
1752 In theRobinson Papersone Copy now in the British Museum
I have met with Two Copies of it in this Country one of them to
appearance once the property of George Selwyn The other is among the
Robinson Papers doubtless very luculent to Robinson who is now home
in England but remembers many a thing Judging from various symptoms
I could guess this MS to have been much about in the English
Aristocratic Circles of that time and to have in some measure given
said Circles their Idea as they were pleased to reckon it of that
wonderful and questionable Kinghighly distracted Idea which in
diluted form is still the staple English one

By the label DEMON NEWSWRITER it is not meant that the Author of
this poor Paper was an actual Devil or infernal Spiritual Essence of
miraculous spectral nature By no means Beyond doubt he is some poor
Frenchman more or less definable as fleshandblood gesturing about
visibly at Berlin in 1752 in cockedhat and bright shoebuckles
grinning elaborate salutations to certain of his fellowcreatures there
Possibly some hungry ATTACHE of Milord Tyrconnels Legation fatally
shut out from the beatitudes of this barbarous Court and willing to
seek solacement and turn a dishonest penny in the PERCONTRA course
Who he is we need not know or care too evident he has the sad quality
of transmuting in his dirty organs heavenly Brilliancy more or less
into infernal Darkness and Hatefulness which I reckon to have been at
all times the principal function of a Devilfunction still carried on
extensively under Firms of another title in this world

Some snatches we will give For though it does not much concern a Man
or King seriously busy what the idle outer world may see good to talk
of him his Biographers in time subsequent are called to notice the
matter as part of his Lifeelement and characteristic of the world
he had round him Friedrichs affairs were much a wonder to his
contemporaries Especially his Domesticities an item naturally obscure
to the outer world were wonderful sure to be commented upon to
all lengths and by the unintelligent first of all Of contemporary
mankind as we have sometimes said nobody was more lied ofof which
let this of the Demon Newswriter be example one instead of many The
Demon Newswriter deriving only from outside gossip and eavesdropping
is wrong very oftenin fact he is seldom right except on points
which have been Officially fixed and are within reach of an inquisitive
Clerk of Legation Wrong often enough even in regard to external
particulars how much more as to internaland will need checking as
we go along

Demon speaks first of Friedrichs stature 5ft 6in as we know better
than this Demon pretty well proportioned not handsome and even
something of awkward GAUCHE acquired by a constrained bearing
head slightly off the perpendicular acquired by his flute say
the betterinformed Is of the greatest politeness Fine tone of
voicefine even in swearing which is as common with him as with a
grenadier adds this Demon not worth attending to on such points

Has never had a nightcap sleeps bareheaded in his later times would
sleep in his hat which was always soft as duffel kneaded to softness
as its first duty and did very well Never a nightcap dressinggown
or pair of slippers TRUE only a kind of cloth cloak NOT QUITE much
worn and very dirty for being powdered in The whole year round he goes
in the uniform of his First Battalion of Guardsblue with red facings
buttonhole trimmings in silver frogs at the inner end his coat
buttons close to the shape waistcoat is plain yellow strawcolor hat
threecornered has edging of Spanish lace white plume horizontal
resting on the lace all round boots on his legs all his life He
cannot walk with shoes pooh you

He rises daily at fiveNo he does nt at all In fact we had
better clap the lid on this Demon illinformed as to all these points
and on such suggestion give the real account of them distilled from
Preuss and the abundant authentic sources

Preuss says if readers could but remember him An Almanac lies on
the Kings Table marking for each day what specific duties the day will
bring From five to six hours of sleep in summer he rises about three
seldom after four in winter perhaps an hour later In his older time
seven hours sleep came to be the stipulated quantity and he would
sleep occasionally eight hours or even nine in certain medical
predicaments Not so in his younger years four AM and five the set
hours then Summer and winter fire is lighted for him a quarter of an
hour before King rises gets into his clothes stockings breeches
boots he did sitting on the bed for one loves to be particular the
rest in front of the fire in standing posture Washing followed more
compendious than his Fathers used to be

Letters specifically to his address a courier leaving Berlin 9
PM had brought him in the dead of night these on the instant of the
Kings calling Here a valet in the ante chamber brought in to him to
be read while his hair was being done His uniform the King did not at
once put on but got into a CASAQUIN loose article of the dressinggown
kind only shorter than ours of rich stuff sometimes of velvet with
precious silver embroideries These Casaquins were commonly skyblue
which color he liked presents from his Sisters and Nieces Letters
being glanced over and hairclub done the Lifeguard GeneralAdjutant
hands in the Potsdam Report all strangers that have entered Potsdam or
left it the principal item this with a Berlin Report which had come
with the Letters and what of ArmyReports had arrived AdjutantGeneral
delivering thesewere now glanced over And so by five oclock in
the summer morning by six in the winter one sees in the gross what
ones dayswork is to be the miscellaneous STONES of it are now mostly
here only mortar and walling of them to be thought of GeneralAdjutant
and his affairs are first settled on each thing a word or two which
the GeneralAdjutant always a highly confidential Officer a Hacke a
Winterfeld or the like pointedly takes down

GeneralAdjutant gone the King in skyblue casaquin often in very
faded condition steps into his writingroom walks about reading his
Letters more completely drinking first several glasses of water then
coffee perhaps three cups with or without milk likes coffee and
very strong After coffee he takes his flute steps about practising
fantasying he has been heard to say speaking of music and its effects
on the soul That during this fantasying he would get to considering
all manner of things with no thought of what he was playing and that
sometimes even the luckiest ideas about businessmatters have occurred
to him while dandling with the flute Sauntering so he is gradually
breakfasting withal will eat intermittently small chocolate cakes
and after his coffee cherries figs grapes fruits in their season
very fond of fruit and has elaborate hothouses So passes the early
morning

Between nine and ten most of ones planwork being got through the
questions of the day are settled or laid hold of for settling Between
nine and ten King takes to reading the Excerpts I suppose of
the more intricate or lengthier things of Yesterday which his three
Cabinet Raths Clerk Eichel and the other Two have prepared for him
King summons these Three one after the other according to their
Department hands them the Letters just read the Excerpts now decided
on and signifies in a minimum of words what the answers are to
beClerk always in full dress listening with both his ears and
pencil in hand May have of Answers CABINETORDERS so called perhaps
a dozen to be ready with before evening In a certain Copy or
FinalRegister Book Herr Preusss Windfall of which INFRA entitled
KABINETSORDENKOPIALBUCH of One of the three Clerks years 17461752
there are on the average ten CABINETORDERS daily Sundays included
Preuss i 352 n

Eichel and Company dismissed King flings off his casaquin takes his
regimental coat has his hair touched off with pomade with powder and
is buttoned and ready in about five minutesready for Parade which
is at the stroke of eleven instead of later as it used to be in Papas
time If eleven is not yet come he will get on horseback go sweeping
about oftenest with errands still at all events in the free solitude
of air till Paradetime do come The Parole SentrysWORD of the
Day he has already given his AdjutantGeneral Parole which only the
Adjutant and Commandant had known till now is formally given out and
the troops go through their exercises manoeuvres under a strictness
of criticism which never abates Parade he by no chance ever misses
says our Demon friend

At the stroke of twelve continues Preuss dinner is served Dinner
threefold that is a second table and a third Only two courses dishes
only eight even at the Kings Table eight also at the Marshals or
second Table guests from seven to ten Dinner plentiful and savory
for the King had his favorites among edibles by no means caring to
be splendidyearly expense of threefold Dinner done accurately by
contract was 1800 pounds Linsenbarth we saw at the Third Table
and how he fared The dinnerservice was of beautiful porcelain not
silver still less gold except on the grandest occasions Every guest
eats at discretionof courseand drinks at discretion Moselle or
Pontac kind of claret Champagne and Hungary are handed round on the
Kings signal King himself drinks Bergerac or other clarets with
water Dinner lasts till twoif the conversation be seductive it has
been known to stretch to four The Kings great passion is for talk of
the right kind he himself talks a great deal tippling wineandwater
to the end and keeps on a level with the rising tide

With a bow from Majesty dinner ends guests gently with a little
saunter of talk to some of them all vanish and the King is in his own
Apartment again Generally fluteplaying for about half an hour
till Eichel and the others come with their days work trayloads of
CabinetOrders I can fancy which are to be executed that is to be
glanced through and signed Signature for most part is all but there
are Marginalia and Postscripts too in great number often of a spicy
biting character which in our time are in request among the curious
Herr Preuss who has right to speak declares that the spice of mockery
has been exaggerated and that serious sense is always the aim both of
Document and of Signer Preuss had a windfall 12000 of these
Pieces or more in a lump in the way of gift which fell on him like
mannaand led it is said to those Friedrich studies extensive
faithful quarryings in that vast wilderness of sliding shingle and
chaotic boulders

Coffee follows this despatch of Eichel and Consorts the day now ones
own Scandalous rumors prose and verse connect themselves with this
particular epoch of the day which appear to be wholly LIES Of which
presently In this afterdinner period fall the literary labors
says Preussa facile pen this Kings only two hours of an afternoon
allowed it instead of all day and the top of the morning About six
or earlier even came the Reader La Mettrie or another came artists
came learned talk At seven is Concert which lasts for an
hour halfpast eight is Supper Preuss i 344347 and with
intermittencies pp 356 361 363 c to 376 abridged

Demon Newswriter says of the Concert It is mostly of
windinstruments King himself often taking part with his flute
performers the best in Europe He has threewhat shall we call them
of male gendera counteralt and Mamsell Astrua an Italian they
are unique voices He cannot bear mediocrity It is but seldom he has
any singing here To be admitted needs the most intimate favor now and
then some young Lord of distinction if he meet with such Concert
very wellbut let us now suppressing any little abhorrences hear him
on another subject

Dinner lasts one hour says our Demon no better informed upon which
the King returns to his Apartment with bows It pretty often happens
that he takes with him one of his young fellows These are all handsome
like a picture FAITS A PEINDRE and of the beautifulest faceadds
he still worse informed poisonous malice mixing itself this time
with the human darkness and reducing it to diabolic This Demons
Paper abounds with similar allusions as do the more desperate sort of
Voltaire utterancesVIE PRIVEE treating it as known fact Letters to
Denis in occasional paroxysms as rumor of detestable nature probably
true of one who is so detestable at least so formidable to a guilty
sinner his Guest Others not to be called diabolical as Herr Dr
Busching for example speak of it as a thing credible as good as
known to the wellinformed And beyond the least question there did a
thriceabominable rumor of that kind run whispering audibly over
all the world and gain belief from those who had appetite A most
melancholy business Solacing to human envyexplaining also to the
dark human intellect why this King had commonly no Women at his Court
A most melancholy portion of my rawmaterial this concerning which
since one must speak of it here is what little I have to say

1 That proof of the NEGATIVE in this or in any such case is by the
nature of it impossible That it is indisputable Friedrich did not now
live with his Wife nor seem to concern himself with the empire of
women at all having except now and then his Sisters and some Foreign
Princess on short visit no women in his Court and though a great judge
of Female merits graces and accomplishments seems to worship women
in that remote way alone and not in any nearer Which occasioned great
astonishment in a world used so much to the contrary And gave rise to
many conjectures among the idle of mankind What on Earth or under
Earth can be the meaning of itand among others to the above
scandalous rumor as some solacement to human malice and impertinent
curiosity

2 That an opposite rumorwhich would indeed have been pretty fatal
to this one but perhaps still more disgraceful in the eyes of a Demon
Newswriterwas equally current and was much elaborated by the curious
impertinent Till Nicolai got hold of it in Herr Dr Zimmermanns
responsible hands and conclusively knocked it on the head See
ZimmermannsFragmenteand Nicolai patiently pounding it to powder
whoever is curious on this disgusting subject

3 That for me proof in the affirmative or probable indication that
way has not anywhere turned up Nowhere for me in these extensive
minings and siftings Not the least of probable indication but
contrariwise here and there rather definite indications pointing
directly the opposite way For example CORRESPONDENCE WITH
FREDERSDORFOEuvresxxvii iii 145 Friedrich in his own
utterances and occasional rhymes is abundantly cynical now and then
rises to a kind of epic cynicism on this very matter But at no time
can the painful critic call it cynicism as of OTHER than an observer
always a kind of vinegar cleanness in it EXCEPT in theory Cynicism
of an impartial observer in a dirty element observer epically sensible
when provoked to it of the brutal contemptibilities which lie in Human
Life alongside of its big struttings and pretensions In Friedrichs
utterances there is that kind of cynicism undeniableand yet he had
a modesty almost female in regard to his own person no servant
having ever seen him in an exposed state Preuss i 376 Which
had considerably strengthened rumor No 2 O ye poor impious
LongearedLongeared I will call you instead of Twohorned and with
only One hoof cloven Among the tragical platitudes of Human Nature
nothing so fills a considering brother mortal with sorrow and despair
as this innate tendency of the common crowd in regard to its Great Men
whensoever or almost whensoever the Heavens do at long intervals
vouchsafe us as their allincluding blessing anything of such
Practical BLASPHEMY is it not if you reflect Strangely possible
that sin even now And ought to be religiously abhorred by every soul
that has the least piety or nobleness Act not the mutinous flunky my
friend though there be great wages going in that line

4 That in these circumstances and taking into view the otherwise known
qualities of this high FellowCreature the present Editor does not
for his own share value the rumor at a pins fee And leaves it and
recommends his readers to leave it hanging by its own head in the sad
subterranean regionstill probably not for a long while yet it drop
to a far Deeper and dolefuler Region out of our way altogether

Lamentable yes comments Diogenes and especially so that the idle
public has a hankering for such things But are there no obscene details
at all then grumbles the disappointed idle public to itself something
of reproach in its tone A public idleminded much depraved in every
way Thus too you will observe of dogs two dogs at meeting run
first of all to the shameful parts of the constitution institute a
strict examination more or less satisfactory in that department That
once settled their interest in ulterior matters seems pretty much
to die away and they are ready to part again as from a problem
doneEnough oh enough

Practically we are getting no good of our Demonand will dismiss him
after a taste or two more

This Demon Newswriter has evidently never been to Potsdam which
he figures as the abode of horrid cruelty a kind of Tartarus on
Earthwhere there is a dreadful scarcity of women for one item
lamentable to ones moral feelings Scarcity nothing like so great even
among the soldierclasses as the Demon Newswriter imagines to himself
nor productive of the results lamented Prussian soldiers are not
encouraged to marry if it will hurt the service nor do their wives
march with the Regiment except in such proportions as there may be
sewing washing and the like womens work fairly wanted in their
respective Companies the Potsdam First Battalion I understand is
hardly permitted to marry at all And in regard to lamentable results
that of LIEBSTENSCHEINE SweetheartTICKETSor actual military
legalizing of Temporary Marriages with regular privileges attached and
fixed rules to be observedmight perhaps be the notablest point and
the SEMIlamentablest to a man or demon in the habit of lamenting
Preuss i 426 For the rest a considerably dreadful place this
Potsdam to the flaccid esurient and disorderly of mankindand
strict as Fate Demon correct for once in inexorably punishing military
sins

This King he says has a great deal of ESPRIT much less of real
knowledge CONNAISSANCES than is pretended He excels only in the
military part really excellent there Has a facile expeditious pen and
head understands what you say to him at the first word Not taking nor
wishing advice never suffering replies or remonstrances not even from
his Mother Pretty well acquainted with Works of ESPRIT whether in
Prose or in Verse burning very hot indeed to distinguish himself by
performance of that kind but unable to reach the Beautiful unless
held up by somebody ETAYE It is said that in a splenetic moment his
Skeleton of an Apollo SQUELETTE DAPOLLON M de Voltaire who is lean
exceedingly exclaimed once some time ago When is it then that he
will have done sending me his dirty linen to wash

The King is of a sharp mocking tongue withal pricking into whoever
displeases him often careless of policy in that Understands nothing
of Finance or still less of Trade always looking direct towards more
money which he loves much incapable of sowing as some of US do
for a distant harvest Treats almost all the world as slaves All his
subjects are held in hard shackles Rigorous for the least shortcoming
where his interest is hurtnever pardons any fault which tends to
inexactitude in the Military Service Spandau very fullthough I did
not myself count Keeps in his pay nobody but those useful to him and
capable of doing employments well TRUE ALWAYS and the instant he has
no more need of them dismissing them with nothing FALSE GENERALLY
The Subsidies imposed on his subjects are heavy in constant proportion
to their Feudal Properties and their Leases of Domains CONTRATS ET
BAUX and what is dreadful are exacted with the same rigor if your
Property gets into debtno remission by the iron grip of this King
in the name of the State Sell if you can find a Purchaser or get
confiscated altogether that is your only remedy Surely a tyrant of a
King

People who get nearest him will tell you that his Politeness is not
natural but a remnant of old habit when he had need of everybody
against the persecutions of his Father He respects his Mother the only
Female for whom he has a sort of attention He esteems his Wife and
cannot endure her has been married nineteen years and has not yet
addressed one word to her how true It was but a few days ago she
handed him a Letter petitioning some things of which she had the
most pressing want He took the Letter with that smiling polite and
gracious air which he assumes at pleasure and without breaking the
seal tore the Letter up before her face made her a profound bow and
turned his back on her Was there ever such a Pluto varnished into
Literary Rosepink Very proper Majesty for the Tartarus that here is

Chapter XI THIRD ACT AND CATASTROPHE OF THE VOLTAIRE VISIT

Meantime there has a fine Controversy risen of mathematical
philosophical and at length of very miscellaneous nature concerning
that KonigMaupertuis dissentience on the LAW OF THRIFT Wonderful
Controversy much occupying the socalled Philosophic or Scientific
world especially the idler population that inhabit there Upon
this item of the Infinitely Littlewhich has in our time sunk into
Nothingatall and but for Voltaire and the accident of his living
near it would be forgotten altogetherwe must not enter into details
but a few words to render Voltaires share in it intelligible will be
in the highest degree necessary Here in brief form rough and ready
are the successive stages of the Business the origin and first stage of
which have been known to us for some time past

SEPTEMBER 1750 Konig his wellmeant visit to Berlin proving so
futile had left Maupertuis in the humor we sawpirouetting round his
Apartment in tempests of rage at such contradiction of sinners on his
sublime Law of Thrift and fulminating permission to Konig No time to
read your Paper of Contradictions publish it in Leipzig in Jericho
anywhere in the Earth in Heaven in the Other Place where you have the
opportunity Konig returning on these terms had nothing for it but
to publish his Paper and did publish it in the LeipzigActa
Eruditorumfor March 1751 There it stands legible to this day and
if any of the human species should again think of reading it I believe
it will be found a reasonable solid and decisive Paper of steadfast
openly articulate by no means insolent tone considerably modifying
Maupertuiss Law of Thrift or Minimum of Actionfatal to the claim
of its being a Sublime Discovery or indeed so far as TRUE any
discovery at all InActa EruditorumLipsiae 1751De universali
Principio AEquilibrii et MotusBy no means uncivil to Maupertuis
though obliged to controvert him For exampleQuoe itaque de Minima
Actionis in modificationibus modum obtinente in genere proferuntur
vehementer laudo continent nempe facundum longeque pulcherrimum
Dynamices sublimioris principium cujus vim in difficillimis
quoestionibus soepe expertus fui By way of finis to the Paper
there is given what proves extremely important to us an Excerpt from
an old LETTER OF LEIBNITZS which perhaps it will be better to present
here IN CORPORE as so much turned on it afterwards Konig thus winds
up

I add only a word in finishing and that is that it appears Mr
Leibnitz had a theory of Action perhaps much more extensive than
one would suspect at present There is a Letter written by him to Mr
Hermann an ancient mathematical sage at Basel where he uses these
expressions Action is not what you think the consideration of Time
enters into it Action is as the product of the mass by the space and
the velocity or as the time by the VIS VIVA I have remarked that in
the modifications of motion the action becomes usually a maximum or
a minimumand from this there might several propositions of great
consequence be deduced It might serve to determine the curves described
by bodies under attraction to one or more centres I had meant to treat
of these things in the Second Part of my DYNAMIQUE which I suppressed
the reception of the First by prejudice in many quarters having
disgusted me MAUPERTUISIANA No ii 22 fromActa Eruditorumubi
supra In MAUPERTUISIANA No iv 166 is the whole Letter Hanover
16th October 1707 no ADDRESS left judged to be to Hermann
MAUPERTUISIANA Hamburg 1753 is a mere Booksellers or even
Bookbinders Farrago with printed TITLEPAGE and LIST of the chief
Pamphlets which had appeared on this Business sixteen by count various
type all 8vo size in my copy Of which only No ii Konigs APPEL
AU PUBLIC and No iv 2d edition of said APPEL with APPENDIX OF
CORRESPONDENCE are illuminative to read Your Minimum of Action it
would appear then is in some cases a Maximum nothing can be said but
that in every case it is EITHER a Maximum or Minimum What a stroke
for our LAW OF THRIFT the at last conclusive Proof of an Intelligent
Creator as the Perpetual President had fancied itSoho what is this
My Discovery an Error And Leibnitz discovered it so far as true

May 28th8th OCTOBER 1751 Maupertuis compressing himself what he
can writes to Konig Very good Monsieur But please inform me
where is that Letter of Leibnitzs I have never seen or heard of it
beforeand I want to make use of it myself To which Konig answers
Henzi gave it me in Copy unfortunate Conspirator Henzi who lost his
head three years ago by sentence of the Oligarch Government at Berne
Government by The Two Hundred of SelectVestry nature very stiff
arbitrary and become rife in abuses against whom had risen angry
mutterings more than once and in 1749 a Select Plot not select ENOUGH
for they discovered it in time Poor ExCaptain Henzi Clerk of the
SaltOffice most frugal studious and quiet of men a very miracle It
would appear of genius solid learning philosophy and pietynot
the chief or first of the conspirators but by far the most
distinguishedwas laid hold of July 2d 1749 and beheaded with
another of them a day or two after Much bewailed in a private
way even by the better kinds of people Copious account of him
inAdelungvii 8691he poor fellow had no end of Papers and
Excerpts had as we know above a hundred volumes of the latter kind
this and some other Letters of Leibnitzs among themI send you the
whole Letter copied faithfully from his Copy The Hague 26th June
inMaupertuisianaNo iv 130 To that effect still in perfect
goodhumor was Konigs reply to his Maupertuis

Hm Copy By Henzi grumbles Maupertuis to himselfSearch in
Berne then it must be there if anywhere To Konig Maupertuis answers
nothing but sulkily resolves on having Search madeand to give
solemnity to the matter requests his Excellency Marquis de Paulmy the
French Ambassador at Berne to ask the Government thereGovernment
having seized all Henzis Papers on beheading him Excellency Paulmy
does accordingly make inquiry in the highest quarter some inquiries
up and down Not the least account of this or of any Leibnitz Letter
to be had from among Henzis Papersthe hundred volumes seemingly
exist no longerOriginal of this Leibnitz Piece is nowhere For eight
months the highest Authorities have been looking about with one
knows not what vivacity or skill in searching and have found nothing
whatever Stage second of the Business finishes in this manner

How lucky for the Perpetual President had he stopped here To Konig
and the common contradiction of sinners he could have opposed as it was
apparently his purpose to do an Olympian silence Pshaw Whereby
the small matter interesting to few would have dropped gently into
dubiety into oblivion and been got well rid of But this of the great
Leibnitz touching on ones LAW OF THRIFT and not only discovering
it half a century beforehand but discovering that it was not true to
Leibnitz one must speakand the abstruse question is What is one to
say Find me the original let us be certain first that you can say
that is one dear point and pretty much the only one The rest at
this time as I conjecture may have been not a little abstruse to the
Perpetual President

And now had the Perpetual President but stopped here there might still
have rested a saving shadow of suspicion on Konigs Excerpt That it
was not exact that it might be wrong in some vital pointYou never
showed me the Original Monsieur Unluckily the Perpetual President
did not stop One cannot well fancy him believing now or ever that
Konig had forged the Excerpt Most likely he had the fatal persuasion
that these were Leibnitzs words and the question What was to be said
or done if the Original SHOULD turn up might justly be alarming to
a Son of the Pure Sciences But at this point a new door of escape
disclosed itself Where is the Original I sayand he rushed full
speed into that galloping triumphantly feeling all safe

OCTOBER 7th 1751 Maupertuis summons his Academy Messieurs permit
me to submit a case perhaps requiring your attention One of our number
dissents from your Presidents Discovery of the Law of Thrift which
surely he is free to do but furthermore he gives an Excerpt purporting
to be from Leibnitz whereby it would appear that your Presidents
Discovery sanctioned in your Acts as new is not new but Leibnitzs
so far as it is good for anythingpossibly stolen therefore and
at any rate fiftyfour years old In selfdefence I have demanded to
see the Original of said Excerpt and the Honorable Member in question
does not produce it What say you Shame to him say they all
there seem to be but few Scientific Members and most of them it
is insinuated have Pensions from the King through their Perpetual
Presidentand determine to make a Starchamber matter of it

Accordingly next day OCTOBER 8th Secretary Formey writes officially
to Konig Produce that Letter within one monthand has got his
Majesty to order That our Prussian Minister at the Hague shall take
charge of delivering such message and shall mark on what day Thing
serious you seePrussian Minister at the Hague delivers and dockets
accordingly To Konigs astonishment who is in a scene of deep trouble
at this time Royal Highness the Stadtholder suddenly dead or dying
died October 22d leaving a very young Heir and a very sorrowful Widow
and Country Much to think of that lies apart from the Maupertuis
matter Which latter however is so very serious too his Prussian
Majestys Minister at Berne is now charged to make new perquisition for
the Leibnitz Original there In short within one month that Document is
peremptorily wanted at Berlin

High proceedings theseand calculated to have one result if no other
Namely that at this point as readers can fancy the idler Public
seeing a streetquarrel in progress began to take interest in the
Question of MINIMUM and quasiscientific gentlemen to gather round and
express with cheery capable look their opinionsstill legible in the
vanished JUGEMENS LIBRES of Hamburg GAZETTE DE SAVANS Leipzig
and other poor Shadows of JOURNALS if you daringly evoke them from the
other side of Styx Which the whole matter being now so indisputably
extinct shadowy Stygian we will not here be guilty of doing but
hasten to the catastrophes that have still a memorability

Konig having in fact nothing more to say about the Leibnitz Excerpt
was in no breathless haste to obey his summons he sat almost two months
before answering anything Did then write however in a friendly strain
to Maupertuis December 10th 1751 MaupertuisianaNo iv 132
Almost on which same day as it chanced the ACADEMIE after two months
dignified waiting had in brief terms repeated its order on Konig
December 11th 1751 Ib 137 To which Konig makes no special answer
having as good as answered the day beforebut does silently send
off to Switzerland to make inquiries and does write once or twice more
when there is occasion for explainingalways in a clear sonorous
manfully firm and respectful tone That he himself had or has no
kind of reason to doubt the authenticity of the Leibnitz Letter that to
himself and so far as he can judge to Maupertuis the question of its
authenticity is without special interesthe Konig having thrown it
in as a mere marginal illustration which decides nothing either for
or against the Law of Thrift That he has in obedience to the Academy
caused search to be made in Switzerland especially at Basel where he
judged the chance might lie but that of this particular Letter
nothing has come to light that he has two other Leibnitz Letters of
indifferent tenor in the late Henzis hand if these will serve in
aught MaupertuisianaNo iv 155 and ib 172192 the two Letters
themselvesbut what farther can he do In short Konig speaks always
in a clear businesslike manful tone the one person that makes a really
respectful and respectable figure in this Controversy of the Infinitely
Little A man whom viewed from this quiet distance it seems almost
inconceivably absurd to have suspected of forging for so small an
object Oh my President that DIRA REGNANDI CUPIDO

Question is however What the Academy will do One Member the best
Geometer among them whose name is not given but which the Berlin
Academy should write in big letters across this sad Page of their
Annals by way of erasure to the same dissented from the high line
of procedure asserting Konigs innocence in this matter nay hinting
agreement with Konigs opinion But was met by such a storm that he
withdrew from the deliberations which henceforth went their own bad
course unanimous though slow And so the matter pendulates all through
Winter 175152 and was much the theme of idle men

Voltaire heard of it vaguely all along but not with distinctness till
the end of July following As Spring advanced Maupertuis had fallen
ill of lungsthreatened with spitting of blood owing to excess of
brandy hints the malicious Voltaire which is fashionable at St
Malo birthplace of Maupertuisand could not farther direct the
Academy in this affair The Academy needs no direction farther Here
very soon for a sick Presidents consolation is what the Academy
decides on by way of catastrophe

THURSDAY EVENING 13th APRIL 1752 The Academy met Curator Monsieur
de Keith presiding about a score of acting Members present To whom
Curator de Keith as the first thing reads a magnanimous brief Letter
from our Perpetual President That for two reasons he cannot attend
on this important occasion First because he is too ill which would
itself be conclusive but secondly and A FORTIORI because he is in
some sense a party to the cause and ought not if he could Whereupon
Secretary Formey having done his Documentary flourishings Curator
Eulergreat in Algebra apparently not very great in common sense
and the rules of good temperreads considerable Report Is No
1 ofMaupertuisiana reciting not in a dishonest but in a dim
wearisome way the various steps of the Affair as readers already know
them and concludes with this extraordinary practical result Things
being so LES CHOSES ETANT TELLES the Fragment being of itself suspect
what could Leibnitz know of Maxima and Minima They were not developed
till one Euler did it quite in late years MaupertuisiansNo
i 22 of itself suspect and Monsieur Konig having failed to c
cit is assuredly manifest that his cause is one of the worst DES
PLUS MAUVAISES and that this Fragment has been forged Singular to
thinkAnd the Academy all things duly considered will not hesitate
to declare it false SUPPOSE and thereby deprive it publicly of all
authority which may have been ascribed to it HEAR HEAR from all
parts

Curator de Keith then collects the votestwentythree in all some
sixteen are of working Members two are from accidental Strangers
travelling students say the enemy the rest from Curators of
QualityVote is unanimous Adopt the Report Fragment evidently
forged and cannot have the least shadow of authority AUCUNE OMBRE
DAUTHORITE Forged by whom we do not now ask nor what the Academy
could on plain grounds now do to Monsieur Konig NOT nail his ears
to the pump oh no enough it IS forged and so remains Signed
Curator de Keith and Six other Officebearers Formey Perpetual
Secretary closing the list

At the name Keith a slight shadow very slight for how could
Keith help himself crosses the mind Is this by ill luck the
Feldmarschall Keith No reader this is LieutenantColonel Keith he

several persons Supra p 203 Had no hand he I hope in that
latter atrocity

On authentic sight of this Sentence for which Konig had at once on
hearing of it applied to Formey and which comes to him without help

ANSWER FROM VERY PRIVATELY VOLTAIRE CALLING HIMSELF A BERLIN
ACADEMICIAN TO A PARIS ONE

BERLIN 18th SEPTEMBER 1752 This is the exact truth in reply to
your inquiry M Moreau de Maupertuis in a Pamphlet entitled ESSAI DE
COSMOLOGIE pretended that the only proof of the Existence of God is the
circumstance that ARnRB is a Minimum ONLY proof p212
Book XVI VOILA He asserts that in all possible cases Action is a
Minimum what has been demonstrated false and he says He discovered
this Law of Minimum what is not less false

M Konig as well as other Mathematicians wrote against this strange
assertion and among other things M Konig cited some sentences of a
Letter by Leibnitz in which that great man says He has observed that
in the modifications of motion the Action usually becomes either a
Maximum or else a Minimum

M Moreau de Maupertuis imagined that by producing this Fragment
it had been intended to snatch from him the glory of his pretended
discoverythough Leibnitz says precisely the contrary of what he
advances He forced some pensioned members of the Academy who are
dependent on him to summon M KonigAs we know too well and
cannot bear to have repeated to us even in the briefest and spiciest
formSentence JUGEMENT on M Konig which declares him guilty of
having assaulted the glory of the Sieur Moreau Maupertuis by FORGING a
Leibnitz LetterWrote then and made write to her Serene Highness the
Princess of Orange who was indignant at so insolent and in fine

Thus the Sieur Moreau Maupertuis has been convicted in the face of
Scientific Europe not only of plagiarism and blunder but of having
abused his place to suppress free discussion and to persecute an honest
man who had no crime but that of not being of his opinion Several
members of our Academy have protested against so crying a procedure and
would leave the Academy were it not for fear of displeasing the
King who is protector of it OEuvres de Voltairelxiii 227
inMaupertuisianaNo xvi

King Friedrichs position in the middle of all this was becoming
uncomfortable Of the controversy he understood or cared to understand
nothing had to believe steadily that his Academy must be right that
Konig was some loose bird envious of an eagle Maupertuis sitting aloft
on his high Academic perch this Friedrich took for the truth of the
matterand could not let himself imagine that his sublime Perpetual
President who was usually very prudent and Jovelike had been led
by his truculent vanity which Friedrich knew to be immense in the man
though kept well out of sight into such playing of fantastic tricks
before high Heaven and other onlookers This view of the matter had
hitherto been Friedrichs nor do I know that he ever inwardly departed
from itas outwardly he for certain never did standing Kinglike
clear always for his Perpetual President till this hurricane of
Pamphlets blew by Voltaires little Piece therefore was the
unwelcomest possible

This new bolt of electric fire launched upon the stormtost President
from Berlin itself and even from the Kings House itselfby whom too
clearly recognizablewhat an irritating thing Unseemly in fact
on Voltaires part but could not be helped by a Voltaire charged with
electricity Friedrich evidently in considerable indignation finding
that public measures would but worsen the uproar took pen in hand
wrote rapidly the indignant LETTER FROM AN ACADEMICIAN OF BERLIN TO AN
ACADEMICIAN OF PARIS OEuvres de Fredericxv 5964 not dated
datable October 1752 which Piece of some length we cannot give
here but will briefly describe as manifesting no real knowledge of the
LAWOFTHRIFT Controversy but as taking the above loose view of it and
as directed principally against the pretended Member of our Academy
mischievous Voltaire to wit whom it characterizes as such a
manifest retailer of lies a concocter of stupid libels have you
ever seen an action more malicious more dastardly more infamousand
other hard terms the hardest he can find This is the privilege of
anonymity on both sides of it

But imagine now a King and his Voltaire doing witty discourse over their
Supper of the gods as on the set days is duly the case with such a
consciousness burning like Bude light though close veiled on the part
of Host and Guest The FriedrichVoltaire relation is evidently under
sore stress of weather in those winterautumn months of 1752brown
leaves splashy rains and winds moaning outwardly withal And alas the
irrepressibly electric Voltaire still far from having ended still
only just beginning his AntiMaupertuis discharges has in the interim
privately got his DOCTOR AKAKIA ready Compared to which the former
missile is as a popgun to a park of artillery shotted with old nails and
broken glassSuch a constraint at the Royal dinnertable amid wine
and wit could not continue The credible account is it soon cracked
asunder and after the conceivable sputterings sparklings and
flashings of various complexion issued in lambent airs of tacit
mutual understanding and in reading of AKAKIA togetherwith peals of
laughter from the King as the common French Biographers assert

Readers know AKAKIA DIATRIBE DU DOCTEUR AKAKIA in
VoltaireOEuvreslxi 1962 says Smelfungus it is one of the
famous feats of Satirical Pyrotechny only too pleasant to the corrupt
Race of Adam There is not much or indeed anything of true poetic
humor in it but there is a gayety of malice a dexterity felicity
inexhaustibility of laughing mockery and light banter capable
of driving a Perpetual President delirious What an Explosion of
glasscrackers fireballs flamingserpentsgenerally of sleeping
gunpowder in its most artistic formsflaming out skyhigh over all
the Parish on a sudden The almostsublime of Maupertuis which exists
in large quantities here is a new artist who knows how to treat it
The engineer of the Sublime always painfully engineering thitherward
without effectan engineer of the Comic steps in on him blows him up
with his own petards in a most unexampled manner Not an owlery has that
poor Maupertuis in the struggle to be sublime often nearly successful
but never once quite happened to drop from him but Voltaire picks it
up manipulates it reduces it to the sublimely ridiculous lodges it
in the form of burning dust about the head of MON PRESIDENT Needless
to say of the Comic engineer that he is unfair perversely exaggerative
reiterative on the owleries of poor Maupertuisit is his function
to BE all that Clever but wrong do you say Well yesand yet the
ridiculous does require ridicule wise Nature has silently so ordered
And if ever truculent President in red wig with his absurd truculences
tyrannies and perpetual struggles after the sublime did deserve to
be exploded in laughter it could not have been more consummately
donethough perversely always as must be owned

The hole bored through the Earth for instance really one sometimes
reflects on such a thing How you would see daylight and the antipodal
gentleman if he bent a little over foot to foot how a little stone
flung into it would exactly but for air and friction reach the other
side of the world would then in a computable few moments come back
quiescent to your hand and so continue forevermorewith other the
like uncriminal fancies

The Latin Town again truly if learning the Ancient Languages
be human Education it might with a Greek Ditto supersede the
Universities and prove excellently serviceable in our struggle
Heavenward by that particular route I can assure M de Voltaire it was
once practically proposed to this Kings Greatgrandfather the Grosse
Kurfurstwho looked into it with face puckered to the intensest in
his great care for furtherance of the Terrestrial Sciences and Wisdoms
but forbore for that time Minute details about it in Stenzel ii
234238 who quotes Erman a poor old friend of ours SUR LE PROJET
DUNE VILLE SAVANTE DANS LE BRANDEBOURG Berlin 1792 date of the
Project was 1667 Then as to Dissecting the Brains of Patagonians
what harm if you can get them gross enough And as to that of exalting
your mind to predict the future does not in fact man look BEFORE and
AFTER are not Memory and in a small degree Prophecy the Two Faculties
he has

These thingswhich are mostly to be found in the LETTRES DE
MAUPERTUIS Dresden 1752 then a brandnew Book but are now
clipt out from the Maupertuis Treatiseswe can fancy to be almost
sublimitiesAlmost unfortunately not altogether And then there is
such a Sisyphuseffort visible in dragging them aloft so far and the
nimble wicked Voltaire so seizes his moment trips poor Sisyphus and
sends him down heelsoverhead in a torrent of roaring debris From
gradual transpiration of our vital force comes Death which perhaps
by precautions might be indefinitely retarded says Maupertuis Yes
truly answers the other if we got ourselves japanned coated with
resinous varnish INDUITS DE POIX RESINEUX who knows Not a sublime
owlery can you drop but it is manipulated ground down put in rifled
cannon comes back on you as tempests of burning dust Enough to send
Maupertuis pirouetting through the world with red wig unquenchably on
fire

Peals of laughter once you are allowed to be nonofficial could not
fail as an ovation from the Kingso report the French Biographers
But there was besides strict promise that the Piece should be
suppressed Never do to send our President pirouetting through the
world in this manner with his wig on fire promise me on your honor
Voltaire promised But alas how could Voltaire perform Once more
the Rhadamanthine fact is Voltaire as Kings Chamberlain was bound
without any promise to forbear and rigidly suppress such an AKAKIA
against the Kings Perpetual President But withal let candid readers
consider how difficult it was to do The absurd blusterous Turkeycock
who has every now and then been tyrannizing over you for twenty years
here you have him filled with gunpowder so to speak and the train
laid There wants but one sparkedition printed in Holland
edition done in Berlin plenty of editions made or makable by a little
surreptitious legerdemainand I never knew whether it was AKAKIA in
print or AKAKIA in manuscript that King and Kings Chamberlain
were now reading together nor does it matter muchyour Turkey
surreptitiously stuffed with gunpowder I say train ready waiting one
flintspark will shoot him aloft scatter him as flaming ruin on all the
winds and you are once and always to withhold said spark Perhaps
had AKAKIA not yet been writtenBut all lies ready there one spark
will do it at any momentand there are unguarded moments and the
Tempter must prevail

On what day AKAKIA blazed out at Berlin surreptitiously forwarded
from Holland or otherwise I could never yet learn so stupid these
reporters But on November 2d the King makes a Visit to sick
Maupertuis which is published in all the Newspapers Rodenbeck IN
DIEHeldenGeschichteiii 531 2d November 1752 5 PMand
one might guess the AKAKIA conflagration and cruel hahaings of
mankind to have been tacitly the cause Then or later sure enough
AKAKIA does blaze aloft about that time and all Berlin and all the
world is in conversation over Maupertuis and it30000 copies sold
in Parisand Friedrich naturally was in a towering passion at his
Chamberlain Nothing for the Chamberlain but to fly his presence
to shriek piteously Accident your Majesty Fatal treachery and
accident after such precautions tooand fall sick to death which
is always a resource one has and get into private lodgings in the

We must be brief On the eighth day after this dread spectacle

Friedrich the same day towards evening sends Fredersdorf to him with

Voltaire in which Collini not eavesdropping heard the voice of M de

three months more follows waiting and hesitation and negotiation also
quite obscure Confused hithering and thithering about permission for
Plombieres about repentance sorrow amendment blame in the end
reconciliation or what is to pass for such Recorded for us in that
whirl of misdated Letterclippings in those Narratives ignorant and
pretending to know perhaps the darkest Section in History Sacred or

In truth all the Doctors owned that it was mortal and even exceedingly
confirmed as such by repeated lapses and relapses Nevertheless by the

thinks he can absolve you if not in whole yet in part This would be
of course in virtue of some act of contrition and penitence imposed
on you but as in the Empire of Satan there is a great respect had of

Chapter XII OF THE AFTERPIECE WHICH PROVED STILL MORE TRAGICAL

Voltaire once safe on Saxon ground was in no extreme haste for
Plombieres He deliberately settled his Printing Affairs at Dresden
then at Leipzigand scattered through Newspapers or what portholes
he had various fiery darts against Maupertuis aggravating the humors
in Berlin and provoking Maupertuis to write him an express Letter
Letter which is too curious especially the Answer it gets to be quite
omitted

Here in the history of Duelling or challenging to mortal combat is
a unique article At which the whole world hahad again perhaps King
Friedrich himself though he was dreadfully provoked at it too No
mending of that fellowand took a resolution in consequence as will
be seen

especially a charming Duchesswho set him upon doing the ANNALES

manner of graces melodies and beneficences a little working too
at the ANNALES in the big Library between whiles Five decidedly
melodious weeks Beautiful interlude or halfhour of orchestral
fiddling in this Voltaire Drama halfhour which could not last On the
heel of which there unhappily followed an Afterpiece or codicil to the
Berlin Visit which so to speak set the whole theatre on fire and
finished by explosion worse than AKAKIA itself A thing still famous to
mankindof which some intelligible notion must be left with readers

The essence of the story is briefly this Voltaire by his fine
deportment in parting with Friedrich had been allowed to retain his
Decorations his Letter of Agreement his Royal BOOK OF POESIES one
of those Twelve Copies printed AU DONJON DU CHATEAU in happier
timesand in short to go his ways as a friend not as a runaway or
one dismissed But now by his late procedures at Leipzig and
firings out of portholes in that manner he had awakened Friedrichs
indignation againFriedrichs regret at allowing him to take those
articles with him and produced a resolution in Friedrich to have them
back They are not generally articles of much moment but as marks of
friendship they are now all falsities One of the articles might be
of frightful importance that Book of Poesies thriceprivate OEUVRE DE
POESIES in which are satirical spurts affecting more than one crowned
head one shudders to think what fires a spiteful Voltaire might cause
by publishing these This was Friedrichs ideaand by no means a
chimerical one as the Fact proved said OEUVRE being actually reprinted
upon him at Paris afterwards not by Voltaire in the crisis of the
SevenYears War to put him out with his Uncle of England whom
it quizzed in passages Title of it isOEuvres du Philosophe de

OEUVRE most especially No difficulty wait for him at Frankfurt as he
passes home demand them of him there And has directly on those
new firings through portholes at Leipzig bidden Fredersdorf take
measures accordingly Friedrich to Wilhelmina 12th April 1753
OEuvresxxvii iii 227

Fredersdorf did so early in April and onward had his Official Person
waiting at Frankfurt one Freytag our Prussian Resident there
very celebrated ever since vigilant in the extreme for Voltaires
arrivaland who did not miss that event Voltaire arriving at last
May 31st did with Freytags hand laid gently on his sleeve at once
give up what of the articles he had about himthe OEUVRE unluckily
not one of them and agreed to be under mild arrest PAROLE DHONNEUR
in the LIONDOR Hotel here till said OEUVRE should come up Under
Fredersdorfs guidance all this and what follows King Friedrich
after the general Order given had nothing more to do with it and was
gone upon his Reviews

In the course of two weeks or more the OEUVRE DE POESIE did come
Voltaire was impatient to go And he might perhaps have at once gone
had Freytag been clearly instructed so as to know the essential from
the unessential here But he was notpoor subaltern Freytag had to
say on Voltaires urgencies I will at once report to Berlin if the
answer be as we hope All right you are that moment at liberty
This was a thing unexpected astonishing to Voltaire a thing demanding
patience silence in three days more with silence as turns out it
would have been all beautifully overbut he was not strong in those
qualities

Voltaires arrest hitherto had been merely on his word of honor I
promise on my honor not to go beyond the Garden of this Inn But he
now without warning anybody privately revoked said word of honor and
Collini and he next morning whisked shiftily into a hackneycoach
and were on the edge of being clear off To Freytags terror and horror
who however caught them in time and was rigorous enough now and loud
enoughstreetmob gathering round the transaction Voltaire very loud
and Freytag toothe matter taking fire here and scenes occurring
which Voltaire has painted in a highly flagrant manner

On the third day Answer from Berlin had come as expected answer as
to the old score All right let him go But to punctual Freytags
mind here is now a new considerable item of sundries insult to his
Majesty to wit breaking his Majestys arrest in such insolent loud
mannerand Freytag finds that he must write anew Post is very slow
and though Fredersdorf answers constantly from Berlin Let him go
let him go there have to be writings and rewritings and it is not
till July 7th after a detention not of nearly three weeks as it might
and would have been but of five and a day that Voltaire gets off and
then too at full gallop and in a very unseemly way

This is authentically the worldfamous Frankfurt Affairdone by
Fredersdorf as we say Friedrich absent in Silesia or in Preussen
even having no hand in it except the original Order left with
Fredersdorf Voltaire has used his flamingest colors on this occasion
being indeed dreadfully provoked and chagrined painting the thing in
a very flagrant mannerknown to all readers Voltaires flagrant
Narrative had the round of the world to itself for a hundred years and
did its share of execution against Friedrich Till at length recently
a precise impartial hand the Herr Varnhagen thought of looking into
the Archives and has in a distinct minute and entertaining way
explained the truth of it to everybodyleaving the Voltaire Narrative

PART I FREDERSDORF SENDS INSTRUCTIONS THE OEUVRE DE POESIE IS GOT
BUT

APRIL 11th 1753 few days after that of Maupertuiss Cartel Voltaire
having set to firing through portholes again and the King being swift
in his resolution on it Factotum Fredersdorf who has a freeflowing
yet a steady and compact pen directs Herr Freytag our Resident at
FrankfurtonMayn To procure from the Authorities there on Majestys
request the necessary powers then vigilantly to look out for
Voltaires arrival to detain the said Voltaire and if necessary
arrest him till he deliver certain articles belonging to his Majesty
Cross of Merit Gold Key printed OEUVRE DE POESIES and Writings
SKRIPTUREN of his Majestys in short various articlesthe
specification of which is somewhat indistinct In Fredersdorfs writing
all this not so mathematically luminous and indisputable as in Eichels
it would have been Freytag put questions and there passed several
Letters between Fredersdorf and him but it was always uncomfortably
hazy to Freytag and he never understood or guessed that the OEUVRE DE
POESIES was the vital item and the rest formal in comparison Which
is justly considered to have been an unlucky circumstance as matters
turned For help to himself Freytag is to take counsel with one Hofrath
Schmidt a substantial experienced Burgher of Frankfurt whose rathship
is Prussian

APRIL 21st Freytag answers That Schmidt and he received his Majestys
Allgracious Orders the day before yesterday Post takes eight days it
would seem that they have procured the necessary powers and are now
and will be diligently watchful to execute the same Which one must
say they in right earnest are patrolling about with lips strictly
closed eyes vividly open and have a man or two privately on watch
at the likely stations on the possible highwaysand so continue
Voltaire doing his ANNALS OF THE EMPIRE and enjoying himself at
Gotha for weeks after Left Gotha 25th May Clog inOEuvres de
Voltairexxv 192 nmuch unconscious of their patrolling

Freytag is in no respect a shining Diplomatistprobably some EMERITUS
Lieutenant doing his function for 30 pounds a year but does it in a
practical solid manner Writes with stiff brevity stiff but distinct
with perfect observance of grammar both in French and German with good
practical sense and faithful effort to do aright what his order is no
trace of MonSIR of OEuvre de PoesHie to be found in Freytag and
most or all of the ridiculous burs stuck on him by Voltaire are to
be pulled off again asas fibs or fictions solacing to the afflicted
Wit Freytag is not of quick or bright intellect and unluckily just
at the crisis of Voltaires actual arrival both Schmidt and Fredersdorf
are off to Embden where there is Grand Meeting of the Embden Shipping
Company with comfortable dividends let us hopeand have left
Freytag to his own resources in case of emergency

THURSDAY MAY 31st about eight in the evening Voltaire does
arrivemost prosperous journey hitherto by Cassel Marburg Warburg
and other places famous then or since Landgraf of Hessen wise Wilhelm
whom we knew honorably lodging him innkeepers calling him Your
Excellency or M le Comteand puts up at the Golden Lion at
Frankfurt where rooms have been ordered Freytag well aware though he
says nothing

FRIDAY MORNING JUNE 1st his Excellency and Suite Voltaire and
Collini have their horses harnessed carriage out and are about taking
the road againwhen Freytag escorted by a Dr Rucker Frankfurt
Magistrate DE MAUVAISE MINE Collini p 77 and a Prussian
recruiting Lieutenant presents himself in Voltaires apartment Readers
know Voltaires account and MonSIR Collinis and may now hear Freytags
own which is painted from fact

Introductory civilities done NACH GEMACHTEN POLITESSEN I made him
acquainted with the will of your most Allgracious Majesty He was much
astonished BESTURZT no wonder he shut his eyes and flung himself
back in his chair Varnhagen p 16 Calls in his friend Collini
whom at first I had requested to withdraw Two coffers are produced
and opened by Collini visitation punctual long and painful lasted
from nine AM till five PM Packets are madea great many
Papers and one Poem which he was unwilling to quit perilous LA
PUCELLEinventories are drawn duly signed Packets are signeted
mutually sealed Rucker claps on the Townseal first Freytag and
Voltaire following with theirs He made thousand protestations of his
fidelity to your Majesty became pretty weak like fainting think you
Herr Resident and indeed he looks like a skeletonWe then made
demand of the Book OEUVRE DE POESIES That he said was in the Big
Case and he knew not whether at Leipzig or Hamburg knew very well
where it was and finding nothing else would do wrote for it showing
Freytag the Letter and engaged on his word of honor not to stir hence
till it arrived

Upon whichwhat is farther to be noted though all seems now
settledFreytag at Voltaires earnest entreaty for behoof of
Madame Denis a beloved Niece Monsieur who is waiting for me hourly at
Strasburg whom such fright might be the death ofputs on paper a few
words the few which Voltaire has twisted into MonSIR PoesHies
and so forth to the effect That whenever the OEUVRE comes Voltaire
shall actually have leave to go And so after eight hours labor nine
AM to five PM everything is hushed again Voltaire much shocked
and astonished poor soul sits quietly down to his ANNALES says
Collinito working more or less a resource he often flies to in
such cases Madame Denis on receiving his bad news at Strasburg sets
off towards him arrives some days before the OEUVRE and its Big Case
King Friedrich had gone May 1st for some weeks to his Silesian
Reviews June 1st very day of this great sorting in the Lion dOr he
is off again to utmost Prussia this timeand knows hitherto and till
quite the end nothing except that Voltaire has not turned up anywhere

 Voltaire cannot have done much at his ANNALS in this interim at the
Golden Lion where he has liberty to walk in the Garden He has been
and is secretly corresponding complaining and applying all round
at a great rate to Count Stadion the Imperial Excellency at Mainz to
French friends to Princess Wilhelmina ultimately to Friedrich himself
InOEuvres de Voltairelxxv 207214 c Letters to Stadion
of strange enough tenor see Varnhagen pp 30 c InOEuvres de
Fredericxxii 303 and inOEuvres de Voltairelxxv 185 is
the Letter to Friedrich dateless totally misplaced and rendered
unintelligible in both Works Letter SENT through Wilhelmina see her
fine remarks in forwarding itOEuvres de Fredericxxvii iii
234 He has been receiving visits from Serene Highnesses Duke of
Meiningen and the like who happen to be in Town Visit from iniquitous
Dutch Bookseller Van Duren Printer of the ANTIMACHIAVEL with whom
we had such controversy once Iniquitous now opulent and prosperous
Van Duren happening to be here will have the pleasure of calling on an
old distinguished friend distinguished friend at sight of him entering
the Garden steps hastily up gives him a box on the ear without
words but an interjection or two and vanishes within doors That is
something Monsieur said Collini striving to weep but unable you
have had a blow from the greatest man in the world Collini p 182
In short Voltaire has been exciting great sensation in Frankfurt and
keeping Freytag in perpetual fear and trouble

MONDAY 18th JUNE the Big Case lumbering along does arrive It is
carried straight to Freytags and at eleven in the morning Collini
eagerly attends to have it opened Freytagto whom Schmidt has
returned from Embden but no Answer from Potsdam or the least light
about those SKRIPTURENis in the depths of embarrassment cannot open
till he know completely what items and SKRIPTUREN he is to make sure of
on opening I cannot till the Kings answer comeBut your written
promise to Voltaire Tush that was my own private promise Monsieur
my own private prediction of what would happen a thing PRO FORMA and
to save Madame Deniss life Patience perhaps it will arrive this very
day Come again to me at three PMthere is Berlin post today then
again in three daysI surely expect the Order will come by this post
or next God grant it may be by this Collini attends at three there
is Note from Fredersdorf Kings Majesty absent in Preussen all this
while expected now in two days Freytags face visibly brightens Wait
till next post three days more only wait Varnhagen pp 3941 And
in fact by next post as we find the OPENSESAME did punctually come
Voltaire and all this big cawing rookery of miseries and rages would
have at once taken wing again into the serene blue could Voltaire but
have had patience three days more But that was difficult for him too
Difficult




PART II VOLTAIRE IN SPITE OF HIS EFFORTS DOES GET AWAY June
20thJuly 7th

WEDNESDAY JUNE 20th Voltaire and Collini word of honor fallen
dubious to them dubious or morehaving laid their plan striving
to think it fair in the circumstanceswalk out from the Lion dOr
Voltaire in blackvelvet coat Ib p 46 with their valuablest
effects LA PUCELLE and moneybox included leaving Madame Denis to
wait the disimprisonment of OEUVRE DE POESIE and wind up the general
business Walk out very gingerlyduck into a hackneycoach and
attempt to escape by the Mainz Gate Freytags spy runs breathless with
the news never was a Freytag in such taking Terrified Freytag has to
throw on his coat order out three men to gallop by various routes
jump into some Excellencys coach kind Excellency lent it which is
luckily standing yoked near by and shoot with the velocity of life
and death towards Mainz Gate Voltaire whom the wellaffected Porter
suspecting something has rather been retarding is still there
Arrested in the Kings nameand there is such a scene For Freytag
too is now raging ignited by such percussion of the terrors and
speaks not like what they call a learned sergeant but like a
drilled sergeant in heat of battle Voltaires tongue also and
CollinisYour Excellenz never heard such brazenfaced lies thrown
on a man that I had offered for 1000 thalers to let them go that
I hadIn short the thing has caught fire broken into flaming chaos
again

Freytag to give one snatch from Collinis side got into the carriage
along with us and led us in this way across the mob of people to
Schmidts to see what was to be done with us Sentries were put at
the gate to keep out the mob we are led into a kind of countingroom
clerk maidand manservants are about Madam Schmidt passes before
Voltaire with a disdainful air to listen to Freytag recounting in
the tone not of a LEARNED sergeant what the matter is They seize our
effects under violent protest worse than vain Voltaire demands to
have at least his snuffbox cannot do without snuff they answer It is
usual to take everything

His Voltaires eyes were sparkling with fury from time to time he
lifted them on mine as if to interrogate me All on a sudden noticing
a door half open he dashes through it and is out Madam Schmidt forms
her squad shopmen and three maidservants and at their head rushes
after What cries he cannot I be allowed toto vomit then They
form circle round him till he do it call out Collini who finds him
bent down with his fingers in his throat attempting to vomit and is
terrified MON DIEU are you ill then He answered in a low voice
tears in his eyes FINGO FINGO I pretend and Collini leads
him back RE INFECTA The Author of the HENRIADE and MEROPE what a
spectacle Collini pp 81 86 Not for two hours had they
done with their writings and arrangings Our portfolios and CASSETTE
moneybox were thrown into an empty trunk what else could they be
thrown intowhich was locked with a padlock and sealed with a paper
Voltaires arms on the one end and Schmidts cipher on the other
Dorn Freytags Clerk was bidden lead us away Sign of the BOUC or
BILLYGOAT there henceforth LION DOR refusing to be concerned with us
farther twelve soldiers Madame Denis with curtains of bayonetsand
other wellknown flagrancies The 7th of July Voltaire did actually
go and then in an extreme hurryby his own blame again These final
passages we touch only in the lump Voltaires own Narrative of these
being so copious flamingly impressive and still known to everybody
How much better for Voltaire and us had nobody ever known it had
it never been written had the poor hubbub no better than a chance
streetriot all of it after amusing old Frankfurt for a while been
left to drop into the gutters forever To Voltaire and various others
me and my poor readers included that was the desirable thing

Had there but been among ones resources a little patience and
practical candor instead of all that vituperative eloquence and power
of tragicomic description Nay in that case this wretched streetriot
hubbub need not have been at all Truly M de Voltaire had a talent for
speech but lamentably wanted that of silenceWe have now only the
sad duty of pointing out the principal mendacities contained in M de
Voltaires worldfamous Account for the other side has been heard
since that and so of quitting a painful business The principal
mendacitiesdeducting all that about POEShIE and the like which we
will define as poetic fictionare

1 That of the considerable files of soldiers almost a Company of
Musketeers one would think stuck up round M de Voltaire and Party in
THE BILLYGOAT Madame Deniss bedcurtains being a screen of
bayonets and the like The exact number of soldiers I cannot learn a
SCHILDWACHE of the Townguard means one surely does not mean Four
for each prisoner reports the arithmetical Freytag which in the
extreme case would have been twelve in whole as Collini gives it and
next day we reduced them to two says Freytag

2 That of the otherwise frightful night Madame Denis had the fellow
Dorn Freytags Clerk a poor hardworked frugal creature with frugal
wife and family not far off insisting to sit in the Ladys bedroom
there emptying bottle after bottle nay at last as Voltaire bethinks
him after a few days threatening toPlainly to EXCEL all belief A
thing not to be spoken of publicly indeed what Lady could speak of
it at all except in hints to an Uncle of advanced yearsProved fact
being that Madame Denis all in a flutter that first night at THE
BILLYGOAT had engaged Dorn for a louisdor to sit in her bedroom
and did actually pay him a louisdor for doing so This is very
bad mendacity clearly conscious on M de Voltaires part and even
constructed by degrees

3 Very bad also is that of the moneys stolen from him by those Official
people M de Voltaire knows well enough how he failed to get his
moneys and quitted Frankfurt in a hurry Here inexorably certain from
the Documents and testimonies on both parts is that final Passage
of the long Firework last crackle of the rocket before it dropped
perpendicular

JULY 6th complete OPENSESAME having come Freytag and Schmidt duly
invited Voltaire to be present at the opening of seals his and theirs
and to have his moneys and effects returned from that old trunk he
speaks of But Voltaire had by this time taken a higher flight July
6th Voltaire was protesting before Notaries about the unheardof
violence done him the signal reparations due and disdained for the
moment to concern himself with moneys or opening of seals Seals
moneys Ye atrocious Highwaymen

Upon which they sent poor Dorn with the sealed trunk in CORPORE to
have it opened by Voltaire himself Collini in THE BILLYGOAT
next morning July 7th says he Collini had just loaded two
journeypistols part of the usual carriagefurniture and they lay on
the table At sight of poor Dorn darkening his chamberdoor Voltaire
the prey of various flurries and highflown vehemences snatched one of
the pistols pistol without powder without flint without lock says
Voltaire efficient pistol just loaded testifies Collinisnatched
said pistol and clicking it to the cock plunged Dornward with
furious exclamations not quite unlikely to have shot Dorn in the
fleshy partshad not Collini hurriedly struck up his hand MON DIEU
MONSIEUR and Dorn with trunk instantly vanished Dorn naturally
ran to a Lawyer Voltaire dreading Trial for intended Homicide
instantly gathered himself and shot away self and Pucelle with
Collini clear offleaving Niece Denis leaving moneys and other
things to wait till tomorrow and settle as they could

After due lapse of days in the due legal manner the Trunk was opened
the 19 pounds of expenses 19 pounds and odd shillings not 100 pounds
or more as Voltaire variously gives it was accurately taken from it
by Schmidt and Freytag to be paid where duein exact liquidation
Landlord of THE BILLYGOAT so much HackneyCoachmen Riding
Constables sent in chase so much as per billand the rest 76
pounds 10s was punctually locked up again till Voltaire should apply
for it Send it after him Friedrich answered when inquired of send
it after him but not reflects he unless there is somebody to take his
Receipt for itour gentleman being the man he is Which case or any
application from Voltaire never turned up Robbed by those highwaymen
of Prussian Agents exclaimed Voltaire everywhere instead of applying
Never applied nor ever forgot Would fain have engaged Collini to
applyespecially when the French Armies had got into Frankfurtbut
Collini did not see his way Three Letters to Collini on the subject
JanuaryMay 1759Collinipp 208211

So that except as consolatory scoldingstock for the rest of his life
Voltaire got nothing of his 76 pounds 10s with jewels and snuffbox
always lying ready in the Trunk for him And it had I suppose at the
long last to go by RIGHT OF WINDFALL to somebody or otherunless
perhaps it still lie overwhelmed under dust and lumber in the garrets
of the old Rathhaus yonder waiting for a legal owner What became of
it no man knows but that no doit of it ever went Freytags or
King Friedrichs way is abundantly evident On the whole what an
entertaining Narrative is that of Voltaires but what a pity he had
ever written it

This was the finishing Catastrophe tragical exceedingly which went
loudsounding through the world and still goesthe more is the pity
Catastrophe due throughout to three causes FIRST That Fredersdorf
not Eichel wrote the Order and introduced the indefinite phrase
SKRIPTUREN instead of sticking by the OEUVRE DE POESIES the one
essential point SECOND That Freytag was of heavy pipeclay nature
THIRD That Voltaire was of impatient explosive nature and in
calamities was wont not to be silent and consider but to lift up his
voice having such a voice and with passionate melody appeal to the
Universe and do worse by way of helping himself

The poor Voltaire after all ejaculates Smelfungus Lean of no
health but melodious extremely in a shallow sense and truly very
lonely old and weak in this world What an end to Visit Fifth began
in Olympus terminates in the Lockup His conduct except in the Jew
Case has nothing of bad at least of unprovokedly bad Lost my teeth
said he when things were at zenith Thought I should never weep
againnow when they are at nadir A sore blow to ones Vanity in
presence of assembled mankind and made still more poignant by noises of
ones own adding France forbidden to him by expressive signallings
miraculous Goshen of Prussia shut these old eyes which I thought
would continue dry till they closed forever were streaming in tears
Letter from Mainz 9th July third day of rout or flight To Niece
Denis left behind OEuvreslxxv 220but soon brightened up
again Courage

How Voltaire now wanders about for several years doing his ANNALES
and other Works now visiting Lyon City which is all in GAUDEAMUS
round him though Cardinal Tencin does decline him as dinnerguest now
lodging with Dom Calmet in the Abbey of Senones ultimately in ones
own firstfloor in Colmar near by digging in Calmets Benedictine
Libraries stuff for his ANNALESwandering about chiefly in Elsass
latterly on the Swiss Border till he find rest for the sole of his
foot Purchased LES DELICES The Delights as he named it a glorious
Summer Residence on the Lake near Geneva supplemented by a Winter
ditto MONRION near Lausanne in February 1755 OEuvresxvii

and continued there still more glorious for almost twenty years
thenceforth ib lxxvii 398 xxxix 307 thank the exact Clog for
both these Notes all this may be known to readers and we must
say nothing of it Except only that next year in his tent or hired
lodgings at Colmar the Angels visited him Abrahamlike after a sort
Namely that one evening late in October 1754 a knock came to his
door Her Serene Highness of Baireuth wishes to see you at the Inn
over there Inn Baireuth say you Heavens whatOr to take it in
the prose form

January 26th 1753 about eight PM while Voltaire sat desolate in
Franchevilles far away the Palace at BaireuthMargraf with candle
at an open window and gauze curtains nearhad caught fire inexorably
flamed up and burnt itself to ashes it and other fine edifices

Margraf has suggested Why not try Montpellier let us have a winter
there On that errand they are end of October 1754 got the length
of Colmar and do the Voltaire miracle in passing Very charming to the
poor man in his rustication here

Eight hours in a piece with the Sister of the King of Prussia writes
he think of that my friends She loaded me with bounties made me a
most beautiful present Insisted to see my Niece would have me go with
them to Montpellier Letters inOEuvreslxxv 450 452 Colmar

and farther on Voltaire tried for the Montpellier but could not
Wrote to Friedrich about it one of his first Letters after the
Explosion applying to Friedrich for a Passport or Letter of
Protection which Friedrich answers by De Prades openly laughing at
it OEuvresxxiii 6 Wilhelmina wintered at Montpellier

South to Italy to Naples back by Veniceat Naples undergoing the
Grotto del Cane and neighborhood Wilhelmina plucked a Sprig of Laurel
from Virgils Grave and sent it to her Brother in the prettiest
manneris home at Baireuth new Palace ready August 1755

These points hurriedly put down careful readers will mark and perhaps
try to keep in mind Wilhelminas Tourings are not without interest to
her friends Of her Voltaire acquaintanceship especially we shall hear
again With Voltaire Friedrich himself had no farther Correspondence
or as good as none for four years and more What Voltaire writes to
him with Gifts of Books and the like in the tenderest regretful
pathetically COOING tone enough to mollify rocks Friedrich usually
answers by De Prades if at allin a quite discouraging manner In the
end of 1757 on what hint we shall see the Correspondence recommenced
and did not cease again so long as they both lived

Voltaire at Potsdam is a failure then Nothing to be made of that Law
is reformed Embden has its Shipping Companies Industry flourishes but
as to the Trismegistus of the Muses coming to our Hearth Some Eight
of Friedrichs years were filled by these Three grand Heads of Effort
perfect Peace in all his borders and in 1753 we see how the celestial
one of them has gone to wreck Understand at last your Majesty that
there is no MusesHeaven possible on Telluric terms and cast that
notion out of your head

Friedrich does cast it out more and more henceforthACH MEIN
LIEBER SULZER what was your knowledge then of that damned race
Casts it out we perceiveand in a handsome silently stoical way
Cherishing no wrath in his heart against any poor devil still in some
sort loving this and the other of them Chasot Algarotti Voltaire
even who have gone from him too weak for the place Too weak alas
yes and I was I wise to try them then With a fine humanity new
hope inextinguishably welling up really with a loyalty a modesty a
cheery brother manhood unexpected by readers

Eight of the Eleven Peace Years are gone in these courses The next
three still silent and smooth to the outward eye were defaced by
subterranean mutterings electric heralds of coming storm Meaning
battle and wrestle again thinks Friedrich listening intent A far
other than welcome message to Friedrich A message ominous thrice
unwelcome not to say terrible Requires to be scanned with all ones
faculty to be interpreted to be obeyed in spite of ones reluctances
and lazinesses To plunge again into the Mahlstrom into the clash of
Chaos and dive for ones Silesia the third timehorrible to lazy
human nature but if the facts are so it must be done




Chapter XIII ROMISHKING QUESTION ENGLISHPRIVATEER QUESTION

The public Events so called which have been occupying mankind during
this Voltaire Visit require now mainly to be forgottenand may
for our purposes be conveniently riddled down to Three FIRST
KingoftheRomans Question SECOND EnglishPrivateer Question
and then hanging curiously related to these Two a THIRD or
EnglishFrench Canada Question Of some importance all of them
extremely important to Friedrich especially that Third and least
expected of them

Witty Hanbury Williams the English Excellency at Berlin busy
intriguing little creature became distasteful there long since and
they had to take him away recalled say the Documents 22d January
1751 Upon which no doubt he made a noise in Downing Street and got
it appears recredentials to Berlin 4th March 1751 Manuscript
LIST in StatePaper Office but I think did not much reside nor intend
to reside having all manner of wandering Continental duties to do and
a world of petty businesses and widespread intrigues Russian German
and other on hand Robinson too is now home returned 1748 Treaty
of Aix in his pocket and an Excellency Keith more and more famous
henceforth has succeeded him in that Austrian post Busy people these
and others now legationing in Foreign parts able in their way but
whose work proved to be that of spinning ropes from sand and must not
detain us at this time

The errand of all these Britannic Excellencies is upon a notable scheme
which Royal George and his Newcastle have devised Of getting all made
tight and the Peace of Aix doubleriveted so to speak and rendered
secure against every contingencyby having Archduke Joseph at once
elected King of the Romans King of the Romans straightway whereby
he follows at once as Kaiser should his Father die and is liable to
no French or other intriguing and we have taken a bond of Fate that
the Balance cannot be canted again Excellent scheme think both these
heads and are stirring Germany with all their might purse in hand to
cooperate and do it Inconceivable what trouble these prescient
minds are at on this uncertain matter It was Britannic Majestys
and Newcastles main problem in this world for perhaps four years
17491753My own child as a fond Noodle of Newcastle used to
call it though I rather think it was the other that begot the wretched
object but had tired sooner of nursing it under difficulties

Unhappily there needs unanimity of all the Nine Electors The poorer you
can buy Bavarian Subsidy or annual pension is only 45000 pounds
for this invaluable object Koln is onlya mere trifle Debate on
Bavarian Subsidy in WalpoleGeorge the Secondi 49 endless

precise Account if anybody now wanted it inAdelungvii 146 149
154 et seq trifles all in comparison of the sacred Balance and dear
Hanover kept scathless But unfortunately Friedrich whom we must not
think of buying is not enthusiastic in the cause Far from it The now
Kaiser has never yet got him according to bargain a ReichsGuarantee
for the Peace of Dresden and needs endless flagitating to do it Does
it at length by way of furtherance to this RomishKing Business 23d
January14th May 1751 Adelungvii 217 The chase of security
and aggrandizement to the House of Austria is by no means Friedrichs
chief aim This of King of the Romans never could be managed by
Britannic Majesty and his Newcastle

It was very triumphant and I think at its hopefulest in 1750 soon
after startingwhen Excellency Hanbury first appeared at Berlin
on behalf of it That was Excellency Hanburys first journey on this
errand and he made a great many more no man readier a stirring
intriguing creature and always with such moneys to distribute had
victorious hopes now and thenwhich one and all proved fatuous
June 1750 Hanbury for Berlin Britannic Majesty much anxious

political whirlpools Such a set are those German Princesand swam
indomitable though near desperate as Project seldom did till happily
in 1753 it sank drownedand left his Grace of Newcastle asking
Welladay And is not England drowned too We hope not

Owing mainly to Friedrichs opposition exclaimed Noodle and the
Political Circles Whichthough it was not the fact Friedrichs
opposition once that ReichsGuarantee of his own was got being mostly
passive Push it through the stolid element then YOU stolid fellows
if you canawoke considerable outcry in England Lively suspicion
there of treasonous intentions to the Cause of Liberty on his Prussian
Majestys part andcoupled with other causes that had risena
great deal of illnature in very dark condition against his Prussian
Majesty And it was not Friedrichs blame chiefly or at all If indeed
Friedrich would have forwarded the Enterprisebut he merely did not
and the element was viscous stolid Austria itself had wished the
thing but with nothing like such enthusiasm as King Georgeto whom
the refusal by Friedrich and Fate was a bitter disappointment Poor
Britannic Majesty Archduke Joseph came to be King of the Romans in due
course right enough And long before that event almost before George
had ended his vain effort to hasten it Austria turned on its pivot
and had clasped not England to its bosom but France thanks to that
exquisite Kaunitz and was in arms AGAINST England dear Hanover and
the Cause of Liberty Vain to look too far aheadespecially with those
fisheyes Smelfungus has a Note on Kaunitz readable though far too
irreverent of that superlative Diplomatist and unjust to the real human
merits he had

The struggles of Britannic George to get a King of the Romans elected
were many Friedrich never would bite at this salutary scheme for
strengthening the House of Austria A bad man is not he And all the
while the Court of Austria seemed indifferent in comparisonand Graf
von KaunitzRietberg Ambassador at Paris was secretly busy wheeling
Austria round on its axis France round on its and bringing them
to embrace in political wedlock Feat accomplished by his Excellency
Kaunitz Paris 17521753accomplished not consummated left ready
for consummating when he Kaunitz now home as Prime Minister or
helmsman on the new tack should give signal Thought to be one of the
cleverest feats ever done by Diplomatic art

Admirable feat for the Diplomatic art which it needed not that I
can see for any other property it had Feat which brought as it was
intended to do a Third Silesian War death of about a million fighting
men and endless woes to France and Austria in particular An exquisite
Diplomatist this Kaunitz came to be Prince almost to be GodBrahma
in Austria and to rule the Heavens and Earth having skill with his
Sovereign Lady too in an exquisite and truly surprising manner Sits
there sublime like a gilt crockery Idol supreme over the populations
for near forty years

One reads all Biographies and Histories of Kaunitz Hormayrs
inOEsterreichischer Plutarchiv 3tes 231283 c c one
catches evidence of his well knowing his Diplomatic element and how to
rule it and impose on it Traits there are of human cunning shrewdness
of eyeof the loftiest silent human pride stoicism perseverance of
determinationbut not to my remembrance of any conspicuous human
wisdom whatever One asks Where is his wisdom Enumerate then do me
the pleasure of enumerating What he contrived that the Heavens answered
Yes to and not No to All silent A man to give one thoughts Sits like
a GodBrahma human idol of gilt crockery with nothing in the belly of
it but a portion of boiled chicken daily very illdigested and
such a prostrate worship from those around him as was hardly
seen elsewhere Grave inwardly unhappylooking but impenetrable
uncomplaining Seems to have passed privately an Act of Parliament
KaunitzRietberg here as you see him is the greatest now alive he I
privately assure youand by continued private determination to have
got all men about him to ratify the same and accept it as valid Much
can be done in that way with stupidish populations nor is Beau Brummel
the only instance of it among ourselves in the later epochs

Kaunitz is a man of long hollow face nose naturally rather turned
into the air till artificially it got altogether turned thither Rode
beautifully but always under cover day by day under glass roof in
the ridingschool so many hours or minutes watch in hand Hated or
dreaded fresh air above everything so that the Kaiserinn a noble
lover of it would always goodhumoredly hasten to shut her windows when
he made her a visit Sumptuous suppers soirees he had the pink of
Nature assembling in his house galaxy domestic and foreign of all the
Vienna Stars Through which he would walk one turn glancing stoically
over his nose at the circumambient whirlpool of nothingshappy the
nothing to whom he would deign a word and make him something O my
friendsIn short it was he who turned Austria on its axis and France
on its and brought them to the kissing pitch Pompadour and Maria

A SECOND PrussianEnglish cause of offence had arisen years ago and
was not yet settled nay is now Spring 1753 at its height or crisis
Offence in regard to English Privateering

Friedrich ever since OstFriesland was his has a considerable Foreign
Tradenot as formerly from Stettin alone into the Baltic Russian
ports but from Embden now which looks out into the Atlantic and the
general waters of Europe and the World About which he is abundantly
careful as we have seen Anxious to go on good grounds in this matter
and be accurately neutral and observant of the Maritime Laws he
had in 1744 directly after coming to possession of OstFriesland
instructed Excellency Andrie his Minister in London to apply at the
fountainhead and expressly ask of my Lord Carteret Are hemp flax
timber contraband No answered Carteret Andrie reported No And
on this basis they acted satisfactorily for above a year But
in October 1745 the English began violently to take PLANKS for
contraband and went on so and ever worse till the end of the War
Adelung vii 334 Excellency Andrie has gone home and a Secretary of
Legation Herr Michel is now here in his steada good few dreary
old Pamphlets of Michels publishing official Declaration official

JANUARY 8th 1748 War still on foot but near ending Michel applies
about injuries about various troubles and unjust seizures of ships
Secretary Chesterfield answers We have an Admiralty Court beyond
question right shall be done Would it were soon then hints
Michel Chesterfield who is otherwise politeness itself confidently
hopes so but cannot push Judicial people

FEBRUARY 1748 Admiralty being still silent Michel applies by
Memorial in a specific case Two Stettin Ships laden with wine from
Bordeaux and a third vessel of some other Prussian port laden with
corn taken in Ramsgate Roads whither they had been driven by storm
Give me these Ships back Memorial to his Grace of Newcastle this
Upon which the Admiralty sits with deliberation decides June 1748
Yes And there is hope that a Treaty of Commerce will follow
Gentlemans Magazinexviii for 1748 pp 64 141 which was far
from being the issue just yet

On the contrary his Prussian Majestys Merchants perhaps encouraged
by this piece of British justice came forward with more and ever more
complaints and instances To winnow the strictly true out of which
from the halftrue or not provable his Prussian Majesty has appointed
a Commission fit people and under strict charges I can believe
Commission takes to Friedrichs own knowledge a great deal of
painsand it does not want for clean corn after all its winnowing
Plenty of facts which can be insisted on as indisputable Such and
such Merchant Ships Schedules of them given in with every particular
time name cargo value have been laid hold of on the Ocean Highway
and carried into English PortsOUT of which his Prussian Majesty has
in all Friendliness to beg that they be now redelivered and justice
done Contraband of War answer the English sorry to have given
your Majesty the least uneasiness but they were carryingNo pardon
me nothing contraband discoverable in them and hands in his verified
Schedules with perfectly polite but more and more serious request
That the said ships be restored and damages accounted for Our Prize
Courts have sat on every ship of them eagerly shrieks Newcastle all
along what can we do Nay a Special Commission shall now 1751 date
not worth seeking fartherspecial Commission shall now sit till his
Prussian Majesty get every satisfaction in the world

English Special Commission counterpart of that Prussian one which is
in vacation by this time sits accordingly but is very slow reports
for a long while nothing except Oh give us time and reports in
the end nothing in the least satisfactory Have entirely omitted
the essential points on which the matter turns and given such confused
account in consequence that it is not well possible to gather from
their Report any clear and just idea of it at all Verdict of the

Friedrich I must have my ships back And after a great many months
and a great many haggles Friedrich weary of giving time instructs
Michel to signify in proper form 23d November 1752 That the
Laws delay seemed to be considerable in England that till the fulness
of time did come and right were done his poor people he Friedrich
himself would hopefully wait but now at last must provisionally pay
his poor people their damageswould accordingly from the 23d day
of April next cease the usual payment to English Bondholders on their
Silesian Bonds and would henceforth pay no portion farther of that
Debt principal or interest about 250000 pounds now owing but
proceed to indemnify his own people from it to the just lengthand
deposit the remainder in Bank till Britannic Majesty and Prussian

astonishing and the people are in great wrath about it April 12th
Friedrich replies in the kindest terms but sticking to his point

said With what rumor in the City commentaries in the Newspapers and
flutter to his Grace of Newcastle may be imagined What a Nephew have
I thinks Britannic Majesty Hah and Embden OstFriesland is not
his Embden itself is mine A great deal of illnature was generated
in England by this one affair of the Privateers had there been no
other and in dark cellars of mens minds empty and dark on this
matter there arose strange caricature Portraitures of Friedrich and
very mad notionsof Friedrichs perversity astucity injustice malign
and dangerous intentionsare more or less vocal in the Old Newspapers
and Distinguished Correspondences of those days Of which this one
sample

To what height the humor of the English ran against Friedrich is still
curiously noticeable in a small Transaction of tragic ExJacobite
nature which then happened and in the commentaries it awoke in
their imagination Cameron of Lochiel who forced his way through the
NetherBow in Edinburgh had been a notable rebel but got away to
France and was safe in some military post there Dr Archibald Cameron
Lochiels Brother a studious contemplative gentleman bred to Physic
but not practising except for charity had quitted his books and
attended the Rebel March in a medical capacitynot from choice as
he alleged but from compulsion of kindredand had been of help to
various Loyalists as well a foe of Human Pain and not of anything else
whatever in fact as appears a very mild form of Jacobite Rebel
He too got to France but had left his Wife Children and frugal
Patrimonies behind himand had to return in proper concealment
more than once to look after them Two Visits I think two had been
successfully transacted at intervals but the third in 1753 proved
otherwise

March 12th 1753 wind of him being had and the slothounds uncoupled
and put on his trail poor Cameron was unearthed at the Laird
of Glenbuckets and there laid hold of locked in Edinburgh
Castlethence to the Tower and to Trial for High Treason Which went
against him in spite of his fine pleadings and manful conciliatory
appearances and manners Executed 7th June 1753 His poor Wife had
twice squeezed her way into the Royal Levee at Kensington with
Petition for mercyfainted the first time owing to the press and
the agitation but did the second time fall on her knees before Royal
George and supplicatewho had to turn a deaf ear royal gentleman I
hope not without pain

The truth is poor Cameronthough I believe he had some vague
Jacobite errands withalnever would have harmed anybody in the rebel
way and might with all safety have been let live But his Grace of
Newcastle and the English generally had got the strangest notion into
their head Those appointments of Earl Marischal to Paris of Tyrconnel
to Berlin Friedrichs nefarious spoiling of that salutary RomishKing
Project and now simultaneous with that his nefarious oonduct in our
Privateer Business all this does it not prove himas the Hanburys
Demon Newswriters and wellinformed persons have taught usto be one
of the worst men living and a King bent upon our ruin What is certain
though now wellnigh inconceivable it was then in the upper Classes
and Political Circles universally believed That this Dr Cameron was
properly an Emissary of the King of Prussias that Camerons errand
here was to rally the Jacobite embers into new flameand that at
the first clear sputter Friedrich had 15000 men of his best

do the matter this time WalpoleGeorge the Secondi 333 353

Adelung vii 338341 for the poor Cameron tragedy itself

About as likely as that the Cham of Tartary had interfered in the
Bangorian Controversy raging I believe some time sincein
Cremorne Gardens fist of all which was Bishop Hoadlys Placeto the
terror of mitres and wigs or that the Emperor of China was concerned
in Meuxs PorterBrewery with an eye to sale of NUX VOMICA Among
all the Kings that then were or that ever were King Friedrich
distinguished himself by the grand human virtue one of the most
important for Kings and for men of keeping well at homeof always
minding his own affairs These were in fact the one thing he minded
and he did that well He was vigilant observant all round for
weathersymptoms thoroughly well informed of what his neighbors had on
hand ready to interfere generally in some judicious soft way at any
moment if his own Countries or their interests came to be concerned
certain till then to continue a speculative observer merely He had
knowledge to an extent of accuracy which often surprised his
neighbors but there is no instance in which he meddled where he had no
businessand few I believe in which he did not meddle and to the
purpose when he had

Later in his Reign in the time of the American War 1777 there is on
the English part in regard to Friedrich an equally distracted notion
of the same kind brought to light Again a conviction namely
or moralcertainty that Friedrich is about assisting the American
Insurgents against usand a very strange and indubitable step is
ordered to be taken in consequence OEuvres de Fredericxxvi 394

English with a difference or FRANGCEE French with a difference
A Question not to be closed by Diplomatic putty try as you will

By Treaty of Utrecht 1713 all Nova Scotia ACADIE as then called
with Newfoundland and the adjacent Islands was ceded to the English
and has ever since been possessed by them accordingly Unluckily that
Treaty omitted to settle a Line of Boundary to landward or westward
for their NOVA SCOTIA or generally a Boundary from NORTH TO SOUTH
between the British Colonies and the French in those parts

The Treaty of AixlaChapelle eager to conclude itself stipulated
with great distinctness that Cape Breton all its guns and furnishings
entire should be restored at once France extremely anxious on
that point but for the rest had being in such haste flung itself
altogether into the principle of STATUSQUOANTE as the short way for
getting through The boundary in America was vaguely defined as now to
be what it had been before the War It had for many years before the
War been a subject of constant altercation ACADIE for instance the
NOVA SCOTIA of the English since Utrecht time the French maintained to
mean only the Peninsula or Nook included between the Ocean Waters and
the Bay of Fundy And more emphatic still on the Isthmus or narrow
space at northwest between said Bay and the Ocean or the Gulf of St
Lawrence they had built Forts Stockades or I know not what on
the Missaquish HODIE Missiquash a winding difficult river northmost
of the Bay of Fundys rivers which the French affirm to be the real
limit in that quarter The sparse French Colonists of the interior
subjects of England are not to be conciliated by perfect toleration of
religion and the like but have an invincible proclivity to join their
Countrymen outside and wish well to those Stockades on the Missiquash
It must be owned too the French Official People are far from
scrupulous or squeamish show energy of management and are very skilful
with the Indians who are an important item Canada is all French has
its Quebecs Montreals a St Lawrence River occupied at all the good
military points and serving at once as bulwark and highway

Southward and westward France in its exuberant humor claims for
itself The whole Basin of the St Lawrence and the whole Basin of the
Mississippi as well Have not we Stockades Castles at the military
points Fortified Places in Louisiana itself Yesand how many
Ploughed Fields bearing Crop have you It is to the good Plougher not
ultimately to the good Cannonier that those portions of Creation will
belong The exuberant intention of the French is after getting back
Cape Breton To restrict those aspiring English Colonies mere
Ploughers and Traders hardly numbering above one million to the Space
eastward of the Alleghany Mountains over which they are beginning
to climb and southward of that Missiquash or at farthest of the

October 1745 before signature at AixlaChapelle much more before
Delivery of Cape Breton the Commandant at Detroit west end of Lake
Erie had received orders To oppose peremptorily every English
Establishment not only thereabouts but on the Ohio or its tributaries
by monition first and then by force if monition do not serve

Establishments of any solidity or regularity the English have not in
those parts beyond the Alleghanies all is desert from the Canada
Lakes to the Carolinas mere huntingground of the Six Nations dotted
with here and there an English tradinghouse or adventurous Squatters
farmto whom now the French are to say Home you instantly and
leave the Desert alone The French have distinct Orders from Court
and energetically obey the same the English have indistinct Orders from
Nature and do not want energy or mind to obey these confusions and
collisions are manifold ubiquitous continual Of which the history
would be tiresome to everybody and need only be indicated here by a
mark or two of the main passages

In 1749 three things had occurred worth mention FIRST Captain Coram
a publicspirited halfpay gentleman in London originator of the
Foundling Hospital there had turned his attention to the fine
capabilities and questionable condition of NOVA SCOTIA with few
inhabitants and those mostly disaffected and by many efforts now
forgotten had got the Government persuaded to despatch June 1749
a kind of Halfpay or Military Colony to those parts more than 1400
persons disbanded officers soldiers and marines under Colonel
Edward Cornwallis Brother of the since famous Lord Cornwallis
CoxesPelhamii 113 Who landed accordingly on that rough
shore stockaded themselves in hardily endeavoring and enduring and
next year built a Town for themselves Town of HALIFAX so named from
the then Lord Halifax President of the Board of Trade which stands
there in more and more conspicuous manner at this day Thanks to you
Captain Coram though the ungrateful generations except dimly in CORAM
Street near your Hospital have lost all memory of you as their wont
is Blockheads never mind them

The SECOND thing is an Ohio Company has got together in Virginia
Governor there encouraging Britannic Majesty giving Charter March
1749 and what is still easier 500000 Acres of Land in those Ohio
regions since you are minded to colonize there in a fixed manner
Britannic Majesty thinks the Country between the Monongahela and
the Kanahawy southern feeders of Ohio will do best but is not
particular Ohio Company we shall find chose at last as the eligible
spot the topmost fork or very Head of the Ohiowhere Monongahela
River from south and Alleghany River from north unite to form The
Ohio where stands in our day the big sooty Town of Pittsburg and
its industries Ohio Company was laudably eager on this matter
LandSurveyor in it nay at length Colonel of a Regiment of 150 men
raised by the Ohio Company was Mr George Washington whose Family
had much promoted the Enterprise and who was indeed a steadygoing
considerate closemouthed Young Gentleman who came to great
distinction in the end

French Governor La Gallisonniere still the man getting wind of this
Ohio Company still in embryo anticipates the birth sends a vigilant
Commandant thitherward with 300 men To trace and occupy the Valleys
of the Ohio and of the St Lawrence as far as Detroit That officer
buries plates of lead up and down the Country with inscriptions
signifying that from the farthest ridge whence water trickled towards
the Ohio the Country belonged to France and nails the Bourbon Lilies
to the foresttrees forbidding the Indians all trade with the English
expels the English traders from the towns of the Miamis and writes
to the Governor of Pennsylvania requesting him to prevent all farther
intrusion Vigilant Governors these French and well supported from
home Duquesne the vigilant successor of La Gallisonniere who is now
wanted at home for still more important purposes as will appear
finding the lead plates little regarded sends by and by 500 new
soldiers from Detroit into those Ohio parts march of 100 miles or
sothe French Government having in this year 1750 shipped no
fewer than 8000 men for their American Garrisonsand where the Ohio
Company venture on planting a Stockade tears it tragically out as will
be seen

The THIRD thing worth notice in 1749 and still more in the following
year and years had reference to Nova Scotia again One La Corne a
recklessly sanguinary partisan military gentleman of the Trenck
INDIGOTrenck species nestles himself winter 174950 on that
Missiquash River head of the Bay of Fundy in the Village of Chignecto
which is admittedly English ground though inhabited by French La Corne
compels or admits the Inhabitants to swear allegiance to France
again and to make themselves useful in fortifying not to say in
drillingwith an eye to military work Hearing of which Colonel
Cornwallis and incipient Halifax are much at a loss They in vain seek
aid from the Governor of Massachusetts Assembly to be consulted first
to be convinced Constitutional rightsNothing possible just at
onceand can only send a party of 400 men to try and recover
Chignecto at any rate April 20th 1750 the 400 arrive there order La
Corne instantly to go Bourbon Flag is waving on his dikes this side
the Missiquash high time that he and it were gone Village Priest
flamingly orthodox as all these Priests are all picked for the
business with his own hands sets fire to the Church in Chignecto
inhabitants burn their houses and escape across the riverLa Corne
as rearguard La Corne across the Missiquash declares That to a
certainty he is now on French ground that he will at all hazards
defend the Territory here and maintain every inch of ittill
regular Commissioners due ever since the Treaty of Aix had not that
ROMISHKING Business been so pressing have settled what the Boundary
between the two Countries isChignecto being ashes and the
neighboring population gone Cornwallis and his Four Hundred had to
return to Halifax

It was not till Autumn following that Chignecto could be solidly got
hold of by the Halifax people nor till a long time after that La Corne
could be dislodged from his stockades and sent packing Gentlemans
Magazinexx 539 295 September 1750 a new Expedition on Chignecto
found the place populous again Indians French Peasants seemingly
Soldiers of a sort who stood very fiercely behind their defences and
needed a determined onrush and volley close into their noses before
disappearing This was reckoned the first military bloodshed if this
were really military on the French side And in November following
some small British Cruiser on those Coasts falling in with a French
Brigantine from Quebec evidently carrying military stores and
solacements for La Corne seized the same by force of battle since
not otherwisethree men lost to the British five to the Frenchand
brought it to Halifax Lawful and necessary says the Admiralty Court
Sheer Piracy shriek the Frenchmatters breaking out into actual
flashes of flame in this manner

British Commissions two in number names not worth mention have
at last in this Year 1750 gone to Paris and are holding manifold
conferences with French dittoto no purpose any of them One reads
the dreary tattle of the Duke of Newcastle upon it in the Years
onward Just going to agree the Duke hopes some difficulties but
everybody French and English wanting mere justice and our and their
Commissioners being in such a generous spirit surely they will soon
settle it His Letters in CoxesPelhamii 407 September
1751 c They never did or could and steadily it went on worsening

That notable private assertion of the French That Canada and Louisiana
mean all America West of the Alleghanies had not yet oozed out to the
English but it is gradually oozing out and that England will have to
content itself with the moderate Country lying east of that Blue range
Not much above a million of you say the French and surely there is
room enough East of the Alleghanies We with our couple of Colonies
are the real Americacounting it is true few settlers as yet
but there shall be innumerable and in the mean while there are
ArmyDetachments Blockhouses fortified Posts command of the Rivers
of the Indian Nations of the waterhighways and military keys to you
unintelligible and we will make it good

The exact cipher of the French guessed to be 50000 and their
precise relativevalue as tillers and subduers of the soil in these
Two Colonies of theirs as against the English Thirteen would be
interesting to know curious also their little bill of trouble taken
in creating the Continent of America in discovering it visiting
surveying planting taming making habitable for manand what
Rhadamanthus would have said of those Two Documents Enough the French
have taken some trouble more or lessespecially in sending soldiers
out of late The French to certain thousands languidly tilling
hunting and adventuring and very skilful in wheedling the Indian
Nations are actually there and they in the silence of Rhadamanthus
decide that merit shall not miss its wages for want of asking Ours is
America West of the Alleghanies say the French openly before long

Yours Yours of all peoples answer the English and begin with
lethargic effort to awake a little to that stupid Foreign Question
important though stupid and foreign or lying far off Who really owned
all America probably few Englishmen had ever asked themselves in their
dreamiest humors nor could they now answer but that North America
does not belong to the French can be doubtful to no English creature
Pitt Chatham as we now call him is perhaps the Englishman to whom of
all others it is least doubtful Pitt is in Office at lastin some
subaltern capacity Paymaster of the Forces for some years past in
spite of Majestys dislike of the outspoken manand has his eyes bent
on Americawhich is perhaps little as you would guess it such the
main fact in that confused Controversy just now

In 1753 28th August of that Year goes message from the Home
Government Stand on your defence over there Repel by force any
Foreign encroachments on British Dominions Holderness OR Robinson
our old friend And directly on the heel of this November 1753 the
Virginia Governorurged I can believe by the Ohio Company who are
lying windbound so longdespatches Mr George Washington to inquire
officially of the French Commandant in those parts What he means
then by invading the British Territories while a solid Peace
subsists Mr George had a long ride up those desert ranges and down
again on the other side waters all out ground in a swash with December
rains no help or direction but from wampums and wigwams Mr George
got to Ohio Head two big Rivers Monongahela from South Alleghany
from North coalescing to form a doublebig Ohio for the Far West
and thought to himself What an admirable threelegged place might be
Chief Post of those regionsnestegg of a diligent Ohio Company
Mr George some way down the Ohio River found a strongish French
Fort logbarracks 200 riverboats with more building and a French
Commandant who cannot enter into questions of a diplomatic nature about
Peace and War My orders are To keep this Fort and Territory against
all comers one must do ones orders Monsieur Adieu And the
steadfast Washington had to return without resultexcept that of the
admirable Threelegged Place for dropping your Nestegg in a commanding
and defenceful way

Ohio Company painfully restrained so long in that operation took
the hint at once Despatched early in 1754 a Party of some Forty or
Thirtythree stout fellows with arms about them as well as tools
Go build us straightway a Stockade in the place indicated you are
warranted to smite down by shot or otherwise any gainsayer And
furthermore directly got on foot and on the road thither a regiment
of 150 men Washington as Colonel to it For perfecting said Stockade
and maintaining it against all comers

Washington and his Hundredandfiftywagonage provender and a piece or
two of cannon all well attended tovigorously climbed the Mountains
got to the top 27th May 1754 and there MET the Thirtythree in retreat
homewards Stockade had been torn out six weeks ago 17th April last
by overwhelming French Force from the Gentleman who said ADIEU and had
the riverboats last Fall And instead of our Stockade they are now
building a regular French FortFORT DUQUESNE they call it in honor
of their Governor Duquesneagainst which Washington and his regiment
what are they Washington strictly surveying girds himself up for the
retreat descends diligently homewards again French and Indians rather
harassing his rear Intrenches himself 1st July at what he calls
Fort Necessity some way down and the second day after 3d July
1754 is attacked in vigorous military manner Defends himself what he
can through nine hours of heavy rain has lost thirty the French only
threeand is obliged to capitulate Free Withdrawal the terms
given This is the last I heard of the Ohio Company not the last
of Washington by any means Ohio Companyits judicious Nestegg
squelched in this manner nay become a fiery Cockatrice or FORT
DUQUESNEneed not be mentioned farther

By this time surely high time now serious military preparations were
on foot especially in the various Colonies most exposed But as usual
it is a thing of most admired disorder every Governor his own King or
ViceKing horses are pulling different ways small hope there
unless the Home Government where too I have known the horses a little
discrepant unskilful in harness will seriously take it in hand
The Home Government is taking it in hand horses willing if a thought
unskilful Royal Highness of Cumberland has selected General
Braddock and Two Regiments of the Line the two that ran away
at PrestonpansABSIT OMEN Royal Highness consults concocts
industriously prepares completes modestly certain that here now is the
effectual remedy

About Newyears day 1755 Braddock with his Two Regiments and
completed apparatus got to sea Arrived 20th February at Williamsburg
in Virginia at Hampden near there if anybody is particular found
now that this was not the place to arrive at that he would lose six
weeks of marching by not having landed in Pennsylvania instead Found
that his Stores had been mispacked at Corkthat this had happened
and also thatand in short that Chaos had been very considerably
prevalent in this Adventure of his and did still in all that now lay
round it much prevail Poor man very brave they say but without
knowledge except of fielddrill a heart of iron but brain mostly
of pipeclay quality A man severe and rigorous in regimental points
contemptuous of the Colonial Militias that gathered to help him
thricecontemptuous of the Indians who were a vital point in the
Enterprise ahead Chaos is very strongespecially if within oneself
as well Poor Braddock took the Colonial Militia Regiments Colonel
Washington as AidedeCamp took the Indians and Appendages Colonial
Chaos much presiding and after infinite delays and confused hagglings
got on march2000 regular and of all sorts say 4000 strong

Got on march sprawled and haggled up the Alleghaniessuch a
Commissariat such a wagonservice as was seldom seen before Poor
General and Army he was like to be starved outright at one time had
not a certain Mr Franklin come to him with charitable oxen with
500 poundsworth provisions live and dead subscribed for at

378 Thereupon however Braddock took the road again sprawled and
staggered at the long last to the top at the top of the Alleghanies
15th Juneand forward down upon FORT DUQUESNE roads nearly
perpendicular in some places at the rate of four miles and even of
one mile per day Much wood all aboutand the 400 Indians to rear
in a despised and disgusted condition instead of being vanward keeping
their brightest outlook

July 8th Braddock crossed the Monongahela without hindrance July 9th
was within ten miles of FORT DUQUESNE plodding along marching through
a wood whenAmbuscade of French and Indians burst out on him French
with defences in front and store of squatted Indians on each flankwho
at once blew him to destruction him and his Enterprise both His men
behaved very ill sensible perhaps that they were not led very well
Wednesday 9th July 1755 about three in the afternoon His two
regiments gave one volley and no more utterly terrorstruck by the
novelty by the misguidance as at Prestonpans before shot it was
whispered several of their own Officers who were furiously rallying
them with word and sword of the sixty Officers only five were not
killed or wounded Brave men clad in soldiers uniform victims of
military Chaos and miraculous Nescience in themselves and in others
can there be a more distressing spectacle Imaginary workers are all
tragical in this world and come to a bad end sooner or later they
or their representatives here but the Imaginary Soldierhe is paid his
wages he and his poor Nation are on the very nail

Braddock refusing to fall back as advised had five horses shot under
him was himself shot in the arm in the breast was carried off the
field in a deathstuporforward all that night next day and next to
Fort Cumberland seventy miles to rearand on the fourth day died
The Colonial Militias had stood their ground Colonel Washington now of
some use againwho were ranked well to rearward and able to receive
the ambuscade as an open fight Stood striving for about three hours
And would have saved the retreat had there been a retreat instead of
a panic rout to save The poor Generalebbing homewards he and his
Enterprise hour after hourroused himself twice only for a moment
from his deathstupor once the first night to ejaculate mournfully
Who would have thought it And again once he was heard to say days
after in a tone of hope Another time we will do better which were
his last words death following in a few minutes Weary heavyladen
soul deep Sleep now descending on itsoft sweet cataracts of Sleep
and Rest suggesting hope and triumph over sorrow after allAnother

The Colonial Populations who had been thinking of Triumphal Arches
for Braddocks return are struck to the nadir by this news French and
Indians break over the Mountains harrying burning scalping the Black
Settlers fly inward with horror and despair And the Home Government
too can prove a broken reed What is to become of us whose is America
to beAnd in fact under such guidance from Home Governments and
Colonial there is no saying how the matter might have gone To men of
good judgment and watching on the spot it was for years coming an
ominous dubietythe chances rather for the French who understand
war and are all under one head Governor Pownals Memorial of which
INFRA in ThackeraysLife of Chatham But there happens to be in
England a Mr Pitt with royal eyes more and more indignantly set
on this Business and in the womb of Time there lie combinations and
conjunctures If the Heavens have so decreed

The English had before this despatched their Admiral Boscawen to
watch certain Warships which they had heard the French were fitting
out for America and to intercept the same by capture if not otherwise
Boscawen is on the outlook accordingly descries a French fleet Coast

detain all French Ships whatsoever till satisfaction were had And
before the end of this Year about 800 French ships value say
700000 pounds were seized accordingly where seizable on their watery

Chapter XVANTIPRUSSIAN WARSYMPTOMS FRIEDRICH VISIBLE FOR A MOMENT

The Burning of AKAKIA and those foolish MaupertuisVoltaire Duellings
by syringe and pistol had by no means been Friedrichs one concern
at the time Voltaire went off Precisely in those same months Carnival
17521753 King Friedrich had in a profoundly private manner come upon
certain extensive AntiPrussian Symptoms Austrian Russian Saxon of
a most dangerous abstruse but at length indubitable sort and is ever
since prosecuting his investigation of them as a thing of life and
death to him Symptoms that there may well be a THIRD Silesian War
ripening forward inevitable and of weightier and fiercer quality than
ever So the Symptoms indicate to Friedrich with a fatally increasing
clearness And of late he has to reflect withal If these
FrenchEnglish troubles bring War our Symptoms will be ripe As in
fact they proved to be

King Friedrichs investigations and decisions on this matter will be
touched upon farther on but readers can take in the mean time the
following small Documentary Piece as Note of Preparation The facts
shadowed forth are of these Years now current 17521755 though this
judicial Deposition to the Facts is of ulterior date 1757

In the course of 1756 as will well appear farther on it became
manifest to the Saxon Court and to all the world that somebody had been
playing traitor in the Dresden Archives Somebody especially in
the Foreign Department copying furtively and imparting to Prussia
Despatches of the most secret thricesecret and thricedangerous
nature which lie reposited there Who can have done it Guesses
researcher were many at length suspicion fell on one Menzel a
KANZELLIST Government Clerk of good social repute and superior
official ability who is not himself in the Foreign Department at
all but whose way of living or the like sign had perhaps seemed
questionable In 1757 Menzel and the Saxon Court and its businesses
were all at Warsaw Menzel dreaming of no disturbance but prosecuting
his affairs as formerlywhen one day September 24th the
slothounds long scenting and tracking being now at the mark Menzel
and an Associate of his were suddenly arrested Confronted with their
crimes with the proofs in readiness and next daymade a clear
Confession finding the matter desperate otherwise Copy of which in
Notarial form exact and indisputable the reader shall now see As
this story of Friedrich and the Saxon Archives was very famous in the
world and mythic circumstances are prevalent let us glance into it
with our own eyes since there is opportunity in brief compass




EXTRACTUS PROTOCOLLORUM IN INQUISITIONSSACHENTHAT IS TO SAY
EXTRACT OF PROTOCOLS IN INQUEST CONTRA FRIEDRICH WILHELM MENZEL AND
JOHANN BENJAMIN ERFURTH

AT WARSAW 25th SEPTEMBER 1757 This day in the Kings Name in
presence of Legationsrath von Saul Hofrath Ferbers and Kriegsrath von
Gotze the Undersigned Examination of the KabinetsKanzellist Menzel
arrested yesterday and now brought from his place of arrest to the
Royal Palacewho ADMONITUS DE DICENDA VERITATE made answers to the
effect following

His name is Friedrich Wilhelm Menzel age thirtyeight is a son of
the late Hofrath and Privyreferendary Menzel who formerly was in the
Kings service and died a few years back Has been seventeen years
Kanzellist at the GEHEIME CABINETSCANZLEI Secret Archive had taken
the oath when he entered on his office

Acknowledges some Slips of Paper ZETTEL now shown to him to be
his handwriting they contained news intended to be communicated to the
Prussian Secretary Benoit now residing here at Dresden formerly

Confesses that he has employed here as well as previously in Dresden
his Brotherinlaw the journeyman goldsmith Erfurth who was likewise
arrested yesterday to convey to the Prussian Secretaries Plessmann
and Benoit such pieces and despatches from the Secret Cabinet
especially the Foreign department as he Menzel wanted to communicate
to said Prussian Secretaries

Confesses having received by degrees since the year 1752 from the
Prussian Minister ENVOYE von Mahlzahn and the Secretaries Plessmann
and Benoit for such communications the sum of 3000 thalers 450
pounds in all

Was led into these treasonable practices by the following circumstance
He owed at that time 100 thalers on a Promissory Note to a certain
Rhenitz who then lived HIELT SICH AUF at Dresden and who pressed him
much for payment As he pleaded inability to pay Rhenitz hinted that he
could put him into the way of getting money and accordingly at last
took him to the then Prussian Secretary Hecht at Dresden by whom he
was at once carried to the Prussian Minister von Mahlzahn who gave him
100 thalers 15 pounds with the request to communicate to him now
and then news from the Archive of the Cabinet For a length of time
Prisoner could not accomplish this as the said Von Mahlzahn wanted
Pieces from the Foreign Office and especially the Correspondence with
the two Imperial Courts of Austria and Russia These papers were locked
in presses which Prisoner could not get at moreover the Court had
in the mean time gone to Warsaw Prisoner remaining at Dresden In that
way many months passed without his being able to communicate anything
till at last about December 1752 the Secretary Plessmann gave him
a whole bunch of keys which were said to be sent by Privycounsellor
Eichel of Potsdam whom we know to try whether any of them would
unlock the presses of the Foreign Department But none of them would
and Prisoner returned the keys pointing out however what alterations
were required to fit the keyhole

And about three weeks after this Plessmann provided Prisoner with
another set of keys among which one did unlock said presses With this
key Prisoner now repeatedly opened the presses and provided Plessmann
whenever requiredoftenest with Petersburg Despatches Had also
three years ago 1754 here in Warsaw communicated Vienna Despatches
three or four times to Benoit especially on Sundays and Thursdays
which were slack days nobody in the Office about noon

The actual first of these Communications did not take place till after
EasterFair 1753 Prisoner not having till said Fair received the
second bunch of keys from Plessmann Now and then he had to communicate
French Despatches Whenever he gave original Despatches he received
them back shortly after and replaced them in the presses During this
present stay of the Court at Warsaw has communicated little to Benoit
except from the CIRCULARS Legation NEWSLETTERS when he found
anything noteworthy in them also now and then the Ponikau Despatches
Ponikau being at the Reichs Diet in circumstances interesting to us
Has received one time and another several 100 thalers from Benoit
since the Court came hither lastAnd so EXIT Menzel

Hereupon the Second Prisoner was brought inwho deposed as follows

He is named Johann Benjamin Erfurth a goldsmith by trade age
thirtytwo the Prisoner Menzels Brotherinlaw

Confesses that Menzel had made use of him at Dresden during one
year to deliver several times sealed papers to the Prussian Secretary
Plessmann or rather mostly to Plessmanns servant Also that here in
Warsaw he has had to carry Despatches to Benoit and to deliver them
into his own hands Latterly he has delivered the Despatches to certain
Prussian peasants who stopped at Benoits and who always relieved each
other and every time the one who went away directed Prisoner in turn
to him that arrived

He received from Menzel yesterday towards noon a small sealed
packet which he was to convey to the Prussian peasant who had made an
appointment with him at the Prussian Office HOF here But as he
was going to take it and had just got outside of the Palace Court a
corporal took hold of him and arrested him Confesses having concealed
the parcel in his trouserspocket and to have denied that he had
anything upon him ACTUM UT SUPRA

Signed GOTZE with titles

Next day September 26th Menzel reexamined answers in effect
following

Plessmann never himself came into the Archive Office at Dresden except
the one time a time that will be notable to us when the Prussians
were there to take away the Papers by force then Plessmann was with
themand we will remember the circumstance

Before leaving Dresden for Poland last Year 1756 he Menzel had
returned the said key to Plessmann who gave him others for use here
After his arrival here he returned these keys to Benoit in the
presence of Erfurth saying they were of no use to him and that he
could not get at the Despatches here Prisoner farther declares that it
was the Minister von Mahlzahn who of his own accord and quite at the
beginning made the proposal concerning the keys and when Plessmann
brought the keys he said expressly they were for the Minister along
with fifty thalers which he Menzel received at the same time ACTUM
UT SUPRA Signed as before HeldenGeschichtev 677 as BEYLAGE
or Appendix to the KurSachsen PRO MEMORIA to the Reichs Diet of
date Regensburg 31st January 1758

We could give some of the stolen Pieces too but they are of abstruse
tenor and would be mere enigmas to readers here Enough that Friedrich
understands them To Friedrichs intense and longcontinued scrutiny
they indicate what is next to incredible but is at length fatally
undeniable That the old TREATY which we called OF WARSAW Treaty
for Partitioning Prussia is still in spite of all subsequent and
superincumbent Treaties to the contrary vigorously alive underground
that Saxon Bruhl and her Hungarian Majesty to whom is now added Czarish
Majesty are fixed as ever on cutting down this afflictive too aspiring
King of Prussia to the size of a Brandenburg Elector busy in these
Menzel Documents considering how it may be done especially how
the bearskin may be SHAREDand that in short there lies ahead
inevitable seemingly and not far off a Third Silesian War

Which punctually came true The THIRD SILESIAN WARsince called
SEVENYEARS WAR that proving to be the length of itis now near
Breaks out has to break out August 1756 The heaviest and direst
struggle Friedrich ever had the greatest of all his Prowesses
Achievements and Endurances in this world And on the whole the last
that was very great or that is likely to be memorable with Posterity
Upon which accordingly we must try our utmost to leave some not untrue
notion in this place and that once DONECourage reader




FRIEDRICH IS VISIBLE IN HOLLAND TO THE NAKED EYE FOR SOME MINUTES
June 23d 1755

In 1755 it was that Voltaire wrote not the first Letter but the first
very notable one to his Royal Friend after their great quarrel Dated
The DELICES near Geneva 4th August 1755 in Rodenbeck i 287
inOEuvres de Fredericxxiii 7 not given by any of the French
Editors seductively repentant and oh so true so tenderRoyal
Friend still obstinate who answers nothing or answers only through
De Prades Yes yes we are aware And it was in the same Year that
Friedrich first saw DAlembertVoltaires successor in a sense And
farther on 1st November 1755 that the Earthquake of Lisbon went
horribly crashing through the thoughts of all mortalsthoughts of
King Friedrich among others whose reflections on it I apprehend are
stingy snarlingly contemptuous rather than valiant and pious and need
not detain us here One thing only we will mention for an accidental
reason That Friedrich this Year made a short run to Hollandand
that actual momentary sight of him happens thereby to be still possible

In Summer 1755 after the WestCountry Reviews and a short Journey
into OstFriesland whence to Wesel on the Rhinewhither Friedrich had
invited DAlembert to meet him whom he finds UN TRESAIMABLE GARCON
likely for the task in handFriedrich decided on a run into Holland
strictly INCOGNITO accompanied only by Balbi Engineer a Genoese and
one page Bade his DAlembert adieu and left Wesel thitherward
June 19th Rodenbeck i 287 At Amsterdam he viewed the Bramkamp
PictureGallery the illustrious Countryhouse of Jew Pinto at
TULPENBURG Tulipborough I saw nothing but whimwhams
COLIFICHETS says he I gave myself out for a Musician of the
King of Poland wore a black wig moreover and was nowhere known
OEuvresxxvii i 268 Potsdam 28th June 1755 and ib p
270 to Wilhelmina who is now on the return from her Italian Journey
UNCERTAIN Anecdotes of adventures among the whimwhams in Rodenbeck
cand for finis got into the common PassageBoat TREKSCHUIT
no doubt for Utrecht that he might see the other fine Countryhouses
along the Vechte Fine enough Countryhousesnot mud and sedges the
main thing as idle readers think To Arnheim up the Vechte in this
manner Wesel and his own Country just at hand again

Now it happened that a young Swisspoor enough in purse but not
without talent and eyesight assistant Teacher in some Boardingschool
thereabouts name of him De Catt age twentyseven born at Morges near
Geneva 1728had got holiday or had got errand poor good soul had
decided on this same day 23d June 1755 to go to Utrecht and so
stept into the very boat where Friedrich was He himself in a Letter
written long after to Editor LAVEAUX shall tell us the rest

As I could nt get into the ROEF cabin because it was all engaged I
stayed with the other passengers in the Steerage DANS LA BARQUE MEME
and the weather being fine came up on deck After some time there
stept out of the Cabin a man in cinnamoncolored coat with gold
buttonHOLES in black wig face and coat considerably dusted with
Spanish snuff He looked fixedly at me for a while and then said
without farther preface Who are you Monsieur This cavalier tone
from an unknown person whose exterior indicated nothing very important
did not please me and I declined satisfying his curiosity He was
silent But some time after he took a more courteous tone and said
Come in here to me Monsieur You will be better here than in the
Steerage amid the tobaccosmoke This polite address put an end to
all anger and as the singular manner of the man excited my curiosity
I took advantage of his invitation We sat down and began to speak
confidentially with one another

Do you see the man in the garden yonder sitting smoking his pipe
said he to me That man you may depend upon it is not happyI
know not answered I but it seems to me until one knows a man and
is completely acquainted with his situation and his way of thought one
cannot possibly determine whether he is happy or unhappy

My gentleman admitted this very goodnatured and led the
conversation on the Dutch Government He criticised itprobably to
bring me to speak I did speak and gave him frankly to know that he
was not perfectly instructed in the thing he was criticisingYou
are right answered he one can only criticise what one is thoroughly
acquainted withHe now began to speak of Religion and with eloquent
tongue to recount what mischief Scholastic Philosophy had brought upon
the world then tried to prove That Creation was impossible At this
last point I stood out in opposition But how can one create Something
out of Nothing said he That is not the question answered I the
question is Whether such a Being as God can or cannot give existence to
what has yet none He seemed embarrassed and added But the Universe
is eternalYou are in a circle said I how will you get out of
itI skip over it said he laughing and then began to speak of
other things

What form of Government do you reckon the best inquired he
among other things The monarchic if the King is just and
enlightenedVery well answered he but where will you find Kings
of that sort And thereupon went into such a sally upon Kings as could
not in the least lead me to the supposition that he was one In the
end he expressed pity for them that they could not know the sweets
of friendship and cited on the occasion these verses his own I
suppose

 Amitie plaisir des grandes ames
 Amitie que les Rois ces illustres ingrats
 Sont assez malheureux de ne connaitre pas

I have not the honor to be acquainted with Kings said I but to
judge by what one has read in History of several of them I should
believe Monsieur that you on the whole are rightAH OUI OUI I
am right I know the gentlemen

We now got to speak of Literature The stranger expressed himself with
enthusiastic admiration of Racine A droll incident happened during
our dialogue My gentleman wanted to let down a little sashwindow and
could nt manage it You dont understand that said I let me
do that I tried to get it down but succeeded no better than he
Monsieur said he allow me to remark on my side that you upon my
honor understand as little of it as IThat is true and I beg your
pardon I was too rash in accusing you of want of expertnessWere
you ever in Germany he now asked me No but I should like to make
that journey I am very curious to see the Prussian States and their
King of whom one hears so much And now I began to launch out on
Friedrichs actions but he interrupted me rapidly with the words
Nothing more of Kings Monsieur What have we to do with them We will
spend the rest of our voyage on more agreeable and cheering objects
And now he spoke of the best of all possible worlds and maintained
that in our Planet Earth there was more Evil than Good I maintained
the contrary and this dispute brought us to the end of our voyage

On quitting me he said I hope Monsieur you will leave me your
name I am very glad to have made your acquaintance perhaps we shall
see one another again I replied as was fitting to the compliment
and begged him to excuse me for contradicting him a little Ascribe
this I concluded to the illhumor which various little journeys I
had to make in these days have given me I then told him my name and
we parted LaveauxHistoire de Frederic2d edition Strasbourg
1789 and blown now into SIX vols instead of four dead all except
this fraction vi 365 Seyfarth ii 234 is right ib 170 wrong
and has led others wrong Parted to meet again and live together for
about twenty years

Of this honest Henri de Catt whom the King liked on this Interview
and sent for soon after and at length got as LECTEUR DU ROI we
shall hear again September 1755 sent for but De Catt was ill and
couldnt December 1757 got Rodenbeck i 285 He did from 1757
onwards what De Prades now does with more of noise the old DArget
functions faithfully and well for above twenty yearsleft a
NoteBook not very Boswellian about the King which is latterly in
the Royal Archives at Berlin and which might without harm or even with
advantage be printed but has never yet been A very harmless De
Catt And we are surely obliged to him for this view of the Travelling
Gentleman with the cinnamoncolored coat snuffy nose and black wig
and his manner of talking on light external subjects while the
inner man of him has weights enough pressing on it Age still under
fiveandforty but looks old for his years

June 23d 1755 it is in the very days while poor Braddock is
staggering down the Alleghanies Braddock fairly over the topand the
Fates waiting him at a Fortnights distance Far away on the other
side of the World But it is notable enough how Pitt is watching the
thing and will at length get hand laid on it and get the kingship over
it for above four years Whereby the JENKINSSEAR QUESTION will
again this time on better terms coalesce with the SILESIAN or
PARTITIONOFPRUSSIA QUESTION and both these long Controversies get
definitely closed as the Eternal Decrees had seen good

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
