Tortillas chocolate olives andthe whiskey of the Americans And
suppers ready But why Don Jose chooses tonight of all nights with
this heretic fog lying over the Mission Hills like a wet serape to take
his supper out here the saints only know Perhaps its some distrust of
his madcap daughter the Dona Jovita perhaps to watch herwho knows
And now to find Diego Ah here he comes So The old story He is
getting Dona Jovitas horse ready for another madcap journey Ah
Retires to table

Enter cautiously from corridor L SANDY MORTON carrying ladys saddle

Manuela Never He would suspect at once Listen Diego If Don Jose

familiarly over the back of DON JOSES chair

Don Jose aside He seems insulted and annoyed His manner strengthens
my worst suspicions He has not expected this Aloud Chocolate
Diego

Sandy leaning over table carelessly Yes I reckon its somewhar thar

Don Jose aside He is unused to menial labor If I should be right
in my suspicions if he really were Dona Jovitas secret lover This
gallantry with the servants only a deceit Bueno I will watch him
Aloud Chocolate Diego

Sandy aside I wonder if the old fool reckons Ill pour it out Well
seeins hes the oldest Pours chocolate awkwardly and spills it on
the table and DON JOSE

Don Jose aside He IS embarrassed I am right Aloud Diego

Sandy leaning confidentially over DON JOSES chair Well old man

Don Jose Three months ago my daughter the Dona Jovita picked you up a
wandering vagabond in the streets of the Mission Aside He does not
seem ashamed Aloud Shesheahem The aguardiente Diego

Sandy aside That means the whiskey Its wonderful how quick a man
learns Spanish Passes the bottle fills DON JOSES glass and then
his own DON JOSE recoils in astonishment I looks toward ye ole man
Tosses off liquor

Don Jose aside This familiarity He IS a gentleman Bueno Aloud
She was thrown from her horse her skirt caught in the stirrup she was
dragged you saved her life You

Sandy interrupting confidentially drawing a chair to the table and
seating himself Look yer Ill tell you all about it It wasnt that
gals fault ole man The hoss shied at me lying drunk in a ditch you
see the hoss backed the surcle broke it warnt in human natur for
her to keep her seat and that gal rides like an angel but the mustang
throwed her Well I sorter got in the way o thet hoss and it stopped
Hevin bin the cause o the hoss shyin for I reckon I didnt look much
like an angel lyin in that ditch it was about the only squar thing for
me to waltz in and help the gal Thar thets about the way the thing
pints Now dont you go and hold that agin her

Don Jose Well well She was grateful She has a strange fondness
for you Americans and at her solicitation I gave youYOU an unknown
vagrantemployment here as groom You comprehend Diego I Don Jose
Castro proprietor of this rancho with an hundred idle vaqueros on my
handsI made a place for you

Sandy meditatively Umph

Don Jose You said you would reform How have you kept your word You
were drunk last Wednesday

Sandy Thets so

Don Jose And again last Saturday

Sandy slowly Look yer ole man dont ye be too hard on me that was
the same old drunk

Don Jose I am in no mood for trifling Hark ye friend Diego You have
seen perhapswho has notthat I am a fond an indulgent father But
even my consideration for my daughters strange tastes and follies has
its limit Your conduct is a disgrace to the rancho You must go

Sandy meditatively Well I reckon perhaps Id better

Don Jose aside His coolness is suspicious Can it be that he expects
the girl will follow him Mother of God perhaps it has been already
planned between them Good Thank Heaven I can end it here Aloud
Diego

Sandy Old man

Don Jose For my daughters sake you understandfor her sakeI am
willing to try you once more Hark ye My daughter is young foolish
and romantic I have reason to believe from her conduct lately that
she has contracted an intimacy with some Americano and that in her
ignorance her foolishness she has allowed that man to believe that he
might aspire to her hand Good Now listen to me You shall stay in her
service You shall find outyou are in her confidenceyou shall find
out this American this adventurer this lover if you please of the
Dona Jovita my daughter and you will tell him thisyou will tell
him that a union with him is impossible forbidden that the hour she
attempts it without my consent she is PENNILESS that this estate
this rancho passes into the hands of the Holy Church where even your
laws cannot reach it

Sandy leaning familiarly over the table But suppose that he sees that
little bluff and calls ye

Don Jose I do not comprehend you coldly

Sandy Suppose he loves that gal and will take her as she stands
without a cent or hide or hair of yer old cattle

Don Jose scornfully Supposea miracle Hark ye Diego It is now
five years since I have known your countrymen these smart Americanos
I have yet to know when love sentiment friendship was worth any more
than a money value in your market

Sandy truculently and drunkenly You hev hev ye Well look yar ole
man Suppose I REFUSE Suppose Id rather go than act as a spy on that
young gal your darter Suppose thathicallowin shes my friend Id
rather starve in the gutters of the Mission than stand between her and
the man she fancies Hey Suppose I woulddamn me Suppose Id see you
and your derned old rancho intother placehicdamn me You hear me
ole man Thats the kind o man I amdamn me

Don Jose aside rising contemptuously It is as I suspected Traitor
Ingrate Satisfied that his scheme has failed he is ready to abandon
her And thisTHIS is the man for whom she has been ready to sacrifice
everythingher home her father Aloud coldly Be it so Diego you
shall go

Sandy soberly and seriously after a pause Well I reckon I had
better Rising Ive a few duds old man to put up It wont take me
long Goes to L and pauses

Don Jose aside Ah he hesitates He is changing his mind SANDY
returns slowly to table pours out glass of liquor nods to DON JOSE
and drinks I looks towards ye ole man Adios

Exit SANDY

Don Jose His coolness is perfect If these Americans are cayotes in
their advances they are lions in retreat Bueno I begin to respect
him But it will be just as well to set Concho to track him to the
Mission and I will see that he leaves the rancho alone

Exit Jose

Enter hurriedly JOVITA CASTRO in riding habit with whip

So Chiquita not yet saddled and that spy Concho haunting the plains
for the last halfhour What an air of mystery Something awful
something deliciously dreadful has happened Either my amiable drunkard
has forgotten to despatch Concho on his usual fools errand or he
is himself lying helpless in some ditch Was there ever a girl so
persecuted With a father wrapped in mystery a lover nameless and
shrouded in the obscurity of some Olympian height and her only
confidant and messenger a Bacchus instead of a Mercury Heigh ho And in
another hour Don Juanhe told me I might call him Johnwill be waiting
for me outside the convent wall What if Diego fails me To go there
alone would be madness Who else would be as charmingly unconscious and
inattentive as this American vagabond Goes to L Ah my saddle and
blanket hidden He HAS been interrupted Some one has been watching
This freak of my fathers means something And tonight of all nights
the night that Oakhurst was to disclose himself and tell me all What
is to be done Hark DIEGO without singing


 Oh heres your aguardiente
 Drink it down


Jovita It is Diego and Mother of God drunk again

Enter SANDY carrying pack intoxicated staggers to centre and
observing JOVITA takes off his hat respectfully

Jovita shaking him by the shoulders passionately Diego How dare you
And at such a time

Sandy with drunken solemnity Miss Jovita did ye ever know me to be
drunk afore at such a time

Jovita No

Sandy Zachy so Its abnormal And it meansthe games up

Jovita I do not understand For the love of God Diego be plain

Sandy solemnly and drunkenly When I say your games up I mean the
old man knows it all Youre blowed upon Hearken miss Seriously
and soberly Your father knows all that I know but as it wasnt my
business to interfere with I hev sorter helped along He knows that you
meet a stranger an American in these rides with me

Jovita passionately Ingrate You have not dared to tell him Seizing
him by the collar and threatening him with the horsewhip

Sandy rising with halfdrunken halfsober solemnity One minit miss
one minit Dont ye dont ye do that Ef ye forget and I dont blame
ye for it ef ye forget that Im a man dont ye dont ye forget
that youre a woman Sit ye down sit ye down so Now ef yell kindly
remember miss I never saw this yer man yer lover Ef yell recollect
miss whenever you met him I allers hung back and waited round in the
mission or in the fields beyond for ye and allowed ye to hev your own
way it bein no business o mine Thar isnt a man on the ranch who
ef hed had a mind to watch ye wouldnt hev known more about yer lover
than I do

Jovita aside He speaks truly He always kept in the background Even
Don Juan never knew that I had an attendant until I told him Aloud
I made a mistake Diego I was hasty What am I to do He is waiting for
me even now

Sandy Well with drunken gravity ef ye cant go to him I reckon its
the squar thing for him to come to ye

Jovita Recollect yourself Diego Be a man

Sandy Fash jus war I say Let him be a man and come to ye here Let
him ride up to this ranch like a man and call out to yer father that
hell take ye jist as ye are without the land And if the old man
allows rather than hev ye marry that stranger hell give this yer
place to the church why let him do it and be damned

Jovita recoiling aside So That is their plan Don Jose has worked
on the fears or the cupidity of this drunken ingrate

Sandy with drunken submission Ye was speaking to me miss Ef yell
take my advicea drunken mans advice missyell say to that lover
of yours ef hes afeard to come for ye here to take ye as ye stand he
aint no man for ye And ontil he does yell do as the ole man says
Fur ef I do say it missand thar aint no love lost between ushes
a good father to ye It aint every day that a gal kin afford to swap a
father like that as she DOES KNOW fur the husband that she DONT Hes
a proud old fool miss but to ye to ye hes clar grit all through

Jovita passionately aside Tricked fooled like a child and through
the means of this treacherous drunken tool Stamping her foot Ah
we shall see You are wise you are wise Don Jose but your daughter
is not a novice nor a helpless creature of the Holy Church
Passionately IllIll become a Protestant tomorrow

Sandy unheeding her passion and becoming more earnest and
selfpossessed Ef ye hed a father miss ez instead o harkinin
to your slightest wish and surroundin ye with luxury hed made your
infancy a struggle for life among strangers and your childhood a
disgrace and a temptation ef he had left ye with no company but want
with no companions but guilt with no mother but suffering ef he had
made your home this home so unhappy so vile so terrible so awful
that the crowded streets and gutters of a great city was something to
fly to for relief ef he had made his presence his very nameyour
name miss allowin it was your fatheref he had made that presence
so hateful that name so infamous that exile that flyin to furrin
parts that wanderin among strange folks ez didnt know ye was the
only way to make life endurable and ef hed given yeI mean this
good old man Don Jose missef hed given ye as part of yer heritage
a taint a weakness in yer very blood a fondness for a poison a poison
that soothed ye like a vampire bat and sucked yer lifeblood seizing
her arm ez it soothed ye ef this curse that hung over ye dragged ye
down day by day till hating him loathing him ye saw yerself day by
day becoming more and more like him till ye knew that his fate was
yours and yours hiswhy then Miss Jovita rising with an hysterical
drunken laugh why then Id run away with ye myselfI would damn
me

Jovita who has been withdrawing from him scornfully Well acted
Diego Don Jose should have seen his pupil Trust me my father will
reward you Aside And yet there were tears in his drunken eyes
Bah it is the liquor he is no longer sane And either hypocrite or
imbecile he is to be trusted no longer But where and why is he going
Aloud You are leaving us Diego

Sandy quietly Well the old man and me dont get on together

Jovita scornfully Bueno I see Then you abandon me

Sandy quickly To the old man missnot the young one Walks to the
table and begins to pour out liquor

Jovita angrily You would not dare to talk to me thus if John
Oakhurstah Checking herself

Sandy drops glass on table hurries to centre and seizes DONA JOVITA
Eh Wot name did you say Looks at her amazed and bewildered

Jovita terrified aside Mother of God What have I done Broken my
sacred pledge to keep his name secret No No Diego did not hear me
Surely this wretched drunkard does not know him Aloud Nothing I
said nothing I mentioned no name

Sandy still amazed frightened and bewildered passing his hand over
his forehead slowly Ye mentioned no name Surely I am wild crazed
Tell me missye didntI know ye didnt but I thought it sounded
like itye didnt mention the name ofofofJohn Oakhurst

Jovita hurriedly No of course not You terrify me Diego You are
wild

Sandy dropping her hand with a sigh of relief No no In course
ye didnt I was wild miss wild this drink has confused me yer
Pointing to his head There are times when I hear that name
misstimes when I see his face Sadly But its when Ive took too
muchtoo much Ill drink no moreno moretonighttonight Drops
his head slowly in his hands

Jovita looking at DIEGOaside Really Im feeling very
uncomfortable Id like to ask a question of this maniac But nonsense
Don Juan gave me to understand Oakhurst wasnt his real name that is
he intimated there was something dreadful and mysterious about it that
mustnt be toldsomething that would frighten people HOLY VIRGIN
it has Why this reckless vagabond here is pale and agitated Don Juan
shall explain this mystery tonight But then how shall I see him
Ah I have it The night of the last festa when I could not leave the
rancho he begged me to show a light from the flat roof of the upper
corridor that he might know I was thinking of himdear fellow He
will linger tonight at the Mission he will see the light he will know
that I have not forgotten He will approach the rancho I shall manage
to slip away at midnight to the ruined Mission I shallah it is
my father Holy Virgin befriend me now with selfpossession Stands
quietly at L looking toward SANDY who still remains buried in
thought as

Enter DON JOSE regards his daughter and DIEGO with a sarcastic smile

Don Jose aside Bueno It is as I expectedan explanation an
explosion a lovers quarrel an end to romance From his looks I should
say she has been teaching the adventurer a lesson Good I could embrace

Sandy rising with a start Yes IaI was only taking leave of Miss
Jovita that hez bin kind to me Shes a good gal ole man and wont be

at table and begins to fill a glass of aguardiente

Don Jose aside looking at his daughter I could embrace her now She
is truly a Castro Aloud to JOVITA Hark ye little one I have news

the dull life of the rancho Tonight come to me two famous caballeros

SCENE 2The Same


Col Starbottle entering to DON JOSE Overlooking the
insult oferinebriated individual whose menial position in
thisererhousehold precludes a demand for personal satisfaction
sir I believe I have the honor of addressing Don Jose Castro Very
good sir Permit me sir to introduce myself as Col Culpepper
Starbottledemn me the legal adviser of Mr Alexander Morton
sen and I may add sir the friend of that gentleman and as such
sirererpersonallypersonally responsible

Alexander Morton puritanically and lugubriously As a Godfearing
man and forgiving Christian Mr Castro I trust you will overlook
the habitual profanity of the erring but wellmeaning man who by the
necessities of my situation accompanies me I am the persona helpless
sinnermentioned in the letters which I believe have preceded me As
a professing member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church I have
ventured in the interest of works rather than faith to overlook the
plain doctrines of the church in claiming sympathy of a superstitious
Papist

Starbottle interrupting aside to ALEXANDER MORTON Ahem ahem
Aloud to DON JOSE My friends manner sir reminds me ofererRam
Bootgum Sing first secretary of Turkish legation at Washington in 45
most remarkable mandemn memost remarkableand warm personal friend
Challenged Tod Robinson for putting him next to Hebrew banker at dinner
with remarkdemn methat they were both believers in the profit
he he Amusing perhaps irreverent certainly Fought with cimeters
Second pass Ram divided Tod in two piecesfact sirjust here
pointing inererregions of moral emotions Upper half called to
mesaid to me warninglylast wordsnever forget itStaralways
called me StarRespect mans religious convictions Legs dead
emotion confined to upper part of bodypathetic picture Ged sir
something to be remembered

Don Jose with grave Spanish courtesy You are welcome gentlemen to
the rancho of the Blessed Fisherman Your letters with their honorable
report are here Believe me senores in your modesty you have
forgotten to mention your strongest claim to the hospitality of my
housethe royal right of strangers

Morton Angels before this have been entertained as strangers says
the Good Book and that I take it is your authority for this
ceremoniousness which else were but lipservice and Papist airs But
I am here in the performance of a duty Mr Castrothe duty of a
Christian father I am seeking a prodigal son I am seeking him in his
winehusks and among his harl

Starbottle interrupting A single moment To DON JOSE Permit me
toererexplain As my friend Mr Morton states we are in fact at
present engaged inererquesterpilgrimage that possibly to
some unless deterred by considerations of responsibilitypersonal
responsibilitysirGed sir might be looked upon as visionary
enthusiastic sentimental fanatical We are seeking a son or as my
friend tersely and scripturally expresses itererprodigal son
I say scripturally sir and tersely but not you understand it
literally nor I may add sir legally Ged sir as a precedent I
admit we are wrong To the best of my knowledge sir theerProdigal
Son sought his own father To be frank sirand Ged sir if Culpepper
Starbottle has a fault it is frankness sir As Nelse Buckthorne said
to me in Nashville in 47 You would infer Col Starbottle that
I equivocate I replied I do sir and permit me to add that
equivocation has all the guilt of a lie with cowardice superadded The
next morning at nine oclock Ged sir he gasped to mehe was lying on
the ground hole through his left lung just here illustrating with DON
JOSES coathe gasped If you have a merit Star above others it
is frankness his last words sirdemn me To be frank sir years
ago in the wild exuberance of youth the son of this gentleman left
hiserererboyhoods home owing to an innocent but natural
misunderstanding with the legal protector of his youth

Morton interrupting gravely and demurely Driven from home by my own
sinful and then unregenerate hand

Starbottle quickly One moment a simple moment We will not weary
you withererhistory or the vagaries of youth Heercame to
California in 49 A year ago touched byererparental emotion
and solicitude my friend resolved to seek him here Believing that
theererlawlessness ofereruntrammelled youth and boyish
inexperience might have led him into some trifling indiscretion we
have sought him successively in hospitals almshouses reformatories
States prisons lunatic and inebriate asylums anderereven on
the monumental inscriptions of theerercountry churchyards We
have thus far I grieve to say although acquiring much and valuable
information of a varied character and interest as far as the direct
matter of our searchwe have been I think I may say unsuccessful
Our search has been attended with theerdisbursement of some capital
under myererdirection which though large represents quite
inadequately theererearnestness of our endeavors

Enter MANUELA

Manuela to DON JOSE The Dona Jovita is waiting to receive you

Don Jose to MORTON You shall tell me further of your interesting
pilgrimage hereafter At present my daughter awaits us to place this
humble roof at your disposal I am a widower Don Alexandro like
yourself When I say that like you I have an only child and that
I love her you will understand how earnest is my sympathy This way
gentlemen Leading to door in corridor and awaiting them

Starbottle aside Umph an interview with lovely woman
meanserintoxication butererno liquor Its evident that the
Don doesnt drink Eh Catches sight of table in corridor and bottle
Oh he does but some absurd Spanish formality prevents his doing the
polite thing before dinner Aloud to DON JOSE One moment sir one
moment If you willererpardon theerseeming discourtesy
for which I am I admitorpersonally responsible I will for a few
moments enjoy theererdelicious air of the courtyard and the
beauties of Nature as displayed in theersunset I willerrejoin
you and theererladies a moment later

Don Jose The house is your own senor do as you will This way Don
Alexandro Exit in door L DON JOSE and MORTON sen

Starbottle Do as you will Well I dont understand Spanish ceremony
but thats certainly good English Going to table Eh Smelling
decanter Robinson County whiskey Umph I have observed that
the spirit of American institutions sir are already penetrating
theerersuperstitions oferforeign and effete civilizations
Pours out glass of whiskey and drinks pours again and observes
MANUELA watching him respectfully What the Devil is that girl looking
at Eh Puts down glass

Manuela aside He is fierce and warlike Mother of God But he is not
so awful as that grayhaired caballero who looks like a fasting St
Anthony And he loves aguardiente he will pity poor Diego the more
Aloud Ahem Senor Courtesies coquettishly

Col Starbottle aside Oh I see Ged not a badlooking girla
trifle dark but Southern andertropical Ged Star Star this
wont do sir no sir The filial affections of Aeneas are not to be
sacrificed through the blandishments oferDodoI mean a Dido

Manuela O senor you are kind you are good You are an Americano one
of a great nation You will feel sympathy for a poor young mana mere
muchachoone of your own race who was a vaquero here senor He has
been sent away from us here disgraced alone hungry perhaps penniless
Wipes her eyes

Col Starbottle The Devil Another prodigal Aloud My dear the case
you have just stated would appear to be theerernormal condition
of theeryouth of America But why was he discharged Pouring out
liquor

Manuela demurely glancing at the colonel He was drunk senor

Starbottle potently Drunkenness my child which iserweakness in
theerergentleman in the subordinate is a crime Whaterexcites
the social impulse and exhilarates the fancy of theermaster of the
house in the performance of his duty renders the servant unfit
for his Legally it is a breach of contract I should give it as my
opinionfor which I am personally responsiblethat your friend Diego
could not recover Ged Aside I wonder if this scapegoat could be our
black sheep

Manuela But that was not all senor It was an excuse only He was sent
away for helping our young lady to a cavalier He was discharged because
he would not be a traitor to her He was sent away because he was too
good too honorabletoo Bursts out crying

Starbottle aside Oh the Devil THIS is no Sandy Morton Coming
forward gravely I have never yet analyzed theerercharacter
of the young gentleman I have the honor to assist in restoring to his
family and society but judgingercalmlyerdispassionately my
knowledge of his own fatherfrom what the old gentleman must have been
in his unregenerate state and knowing what he is now in his present
reformed Christian condition I should say calmly and deliberately that
the son must be the most infernal and accomplished villain unhung Ged
I have a thought an inspiration To MANUELA tapping her under the
chin I see my dear a lover ha ha Ah you rogue Well well we
will talk of this again I willererinterest myself in this Diego
Exit MANUELA

Starbottle solus How would it do to get up a prodigal Umph
Something must be done soon the old man grows languid in his search
My position as a sinecure iserin peril A prodigal ready made But

Starbottle bowing to the ground with equal delight and exaggerated
courtesy ErCoolpepero

Dona Jovita Don Culpepero If we throw ourselves unasked at your
Excellencys feet courtesy if we appear unsought before the light of
your Excellencys eyes courtesy if we err in maidenly decorum in thus
seeking unbidden your Excellencys presence courtesy believe us it
is the fear of some greater some graver indecorum in our conduct that
has withdrawn your Excellencys person from us since you have graced our
roof with your company We know Senor Commander how superior are the
charms of the American ladies It is in no spirit of rivalry with them
but to showMother of Godthat we are not absolutely ugly that we
intrude upon your Excellencys solitude Aside I shall need the old
fool and shall use him

Col Starbottle who has been bowing and saluting with equal
extravagance during this speechaside Ged she IS beautiful
Aloud Permit me ererDona Jovita to correctGed I must say

presence remarks disparaging thoseercharms it is my privilege

the enjoyment of Nature

Dona Jovita Is there enough for your Excellency to share with me

moonlight DON JOSE and MORTON seat themselves at table Shall we not
let these venerable caballeros enjoy their confidences and experiences
together Aside Don Jose watches me like a fox does not intend
to lose sight of me How shall I show the light three times from the
courtyard roof I have it Takes STARBOTTLES arm It is too pleasant
to withdraw There is a view from the courtyard wall your Excellency
should see Will you accompany me The ascent is easy

Starbottle bowing I will ascend although permit me to say Dona
Jovita it would beerimpossible for me to be nearererheaven
thanerat present

Dona Jovita FLATTERER Come you shall tell me about this sad lady who
died Ah Don Culpepero let me hope all your experiences will not be so
fatal to us

Exeunt DONA JOVITA and STARBOTTLE

Morton aside A froward daughter of Baal and if I mistake not
even now concocting mischief for this foolish indulgent stiffnecked
father Aloud Your only daughter I presume

Don Jose My darling Don Alexandro Motherless from her infancy A
little wild and inclined to gayety but I hope not seeking for more
than these walls afford I have checked her but seldom Don Alexandro
and then I did not let her see my hand on the rein that held her back I
do not ask her confidence always I only want her to know that when the
time comes it can be given to me without fear

Morton Umph

Don Jose leaning forward confidentially To show that you have not
intrusted your confidence regarding your wayward sonwhom may the
saints return to youto unsympathetic or inexperienced ears I will
impart a secret A few weeks ago I detected an innocent intimacy between
this foolish girl and a vagabond vaquero in my employ You understand
it was on her part romantic visionary on his calculating shrewd
selfinterested for he expected to become my heir I did not lock her
up I did not tax her with it I humored it Today I satisfied the
lover that his investment was not profitable that a marriage without my
consent entailed the loss of the property and then left them together
They parted in tears think you Don Alexandro No but mutually hating
each other The romance was over An American would have opposed the
girl have driven her to secrecy to an elopement perhaps Eh

Morton scornfully And you believe that they have abandoned their
plans

Don Jose I am surehush she is here

Enter on roof of corridor STARBOTTLE and JOVITA

Col Starbottle Really a superb landscape An admirable view of
theerfogrolling over the Mission Hills the plains below and
theerersingle figure ofermotionless horseman

Dona Jovita quickly Some belated vaquero Do you smoke Senor
Commander

Starbottle At times

Dona Jovita With me I will light a cigarette for you it is the
custom

COL STARBOTTLE draws match from his pocket and is about to light but
is stopped by DONA JOVITA

Dona Jovita Pardon your Excellency but we cannot endure your American
matches There is a taper in the passage

COL STARBOTTLE brings taper DONA JOVITA turns to light cigarette but
manages to blow out candle

Dona Jovita I must try your gallantry again That is once I have
failed Significantly

COL STARBOTTLE relights candle business same results

Dona Jovita I am stupid and nervous tonight I have failed twice
With emphasis

COL STARBOTTLE repeats business with candle DONA JOVITA lights
cigarette hands it to the colonel

Dona Jovita Thrice and I have succeeded Blows out candle

Col Starbottle A thousand thanks There is aererlight on the
plain

Dona Jovita hastily It is the vaqueros returning My father gives a
festa to peons in honor of your arrival There will be a dance You have
been patient Senor Commander you shall have my hand for a waltz

Enter vaqueros their wives and daughters A dance during which the
sembi canca is danced by COL STARBOTTLE and DONA JOVITA Business
during which the bell of Mission Church faintly illuminated beyond the
wall strikes twelve Dancers withdraw hurriedly leaving alone MANUELA

MANUELA CONCHO MORTON DON JOSE JOVITA STARBOTTLE


SCENE 3The same Stage darkened Fog passing beyond wall outside and
occasionally obscuring moonlit landscape beyond Enter JOVITA softly
from corridor L Her face is partly hidden by Spanish mantilla

Jovita All quiet at last and thanks to much aguardiente my warlike
admirer snores peacefully above Yet I could swear I heard the old
Puritans door creak as I descended Pshaw What matters Goes to
gateway and tries gate Locked Carramba I see it now Under the
pretext of reviving the old ceremony Don Jose has locked the gates and
placed me in the custody of his guest Stay There is a door leading to
the corral from the passage by Conchos room Bueno Don Jose shall see
Exit R

Enter cautiously R OLD MORTON

Old Morton I was not mistaken It was the skirt of that Jezebel
daughter that whisked past my door a moment ago and her figure that
flitted down that corridor So The lover driven out of the house at
four P M and at twelve oclock at night the young lady trying the
gate secretly This may be Spanish resignation and filial submission
but it looks very like Yankee disobedience and forwardness Perhaps its
well that the keys are in my pocket This fond confiding Papist may find
the heretic American father of some service Conceals himself behind
pillar of corridor

After a pause the head of JOHN OAKHURST appears over the wall of
corridor he climbs up to roof of corridor and descends very quietly
and deliberately to stage

Oakhurst dusting his clothing with his handkerchief I never knew
before why these Spaniards covered their adobe walls with whitewash
Leans against pillar in shadow

Reenter JOVITA hastily

Jovita All is lost the corral door is locked the key is outside and
Concho is gonegone where Madre di Dios to discover perhaps to kill
him

Oakhurst approaching her No

Jovita Juan Embracing him But how did you get here This is
madness

Oakhurst As you did not come to the mission I came to the rancho
I found the gate lockedby the way is not that a novelty hereI
climbed the wall But you Miss Castro you are trembling Your little
hands are cold

Jovita glancing around Nothing nothing But you are running a
terrible risk At any moment we may be discovered

Oakhurst I understand you it would be bad for the discoverer Never
fear I will be patient

Jovita But I feared that you might meet Concho

Oakhurst ConchoConchomeditatively Let me seetall dark long
in the arm weighs about one hundred and eighty and active

Jovita Yes tell me You have met him

Oakhurst Possibly possibly Was he a friend of yours

Jovita No

Oakhurst Thats better Are his pursuits here sedentary or active

Jovita He is my fathers majordomo

Oakhurst I see a sinecure Aside Well if he has to lay up for a
week or two the rancho wont suffer

Jovita Well

Oakhurst Well

Jovita passionately There having scaled the wall at the risk of
being discoveredthis is all you have to say Turning away

Oakhurst quietly Perhaps Jovita taking her hand with grave
earnestness to a clandestine intimacy like ours there is but one end
It is not merely elopement not merely marriage it is exposure Sooner
or later you and I must face the eyes we now shun What matters if
tonight or later

Jovita quickly I am ready It was you who

Oakhurst It was I who first demanded secrecy but it was I who told you
when we last met that I would tell you why tonight

Jovita I am ready but hear me Juan nothing can change my faith in
you

Oakhurst sadly You know not what you say Listen my child I am a
gambler Not the man who lavishes his fortune at the gamingtable for
excitements sake not the fanatic who stakes his own earningsperhaps
the confided earnings of otherson a single coup No he is the man who
loseswhom the world deplores pities and forgives I am the man who
winswhom the world hates and despises

Jovita I do not understand you Juan

Oakhurst So much the better perhaps But you must hear me I make a
professionan occupation more exacting more wearying more laborious
than that of your meanest herdsmanof that which others make a
dissipation of the senses And yet Jovita there is not the meanest
vaquero in this ranch who playing against me winning or losing is
not held to be my superior I have no friendsonly confederates Even
the woman who dares to pity me must do it in secret

Jovita But you will abandon this dreadful trade As the son of the
rich Don Jose no one dare scorn you My father will relent I am his
heiress

Oakhurst No more Jovita no more If I were the man who could purchase
the worlds respect through a womans weakness for him I should not be
here tonight I am not here to sue your fathers daughter with hopes
of forgiveness promises of reformation Reformation in a man like me
means cowardice or selfinterest OLD MORTON becoming excited leans
slowly out from the shadow of the pillar listening intently I am here
to take by force if necessary a gamblers wifethe woman who will
share my fortunes my disgrace my losses who is willing to leave her
old life of indulgence of luxury of respectability for mine You are
frightened little dove compose yourself soothing her tenderly and
sadly you are frightened at the cruel hawk who has chosen you for a
mate

Old Morton aside God in heaven This is like HIM like melike me
before the blessed Lord lifted me into regeneration If it should be
Leans forward anxiously from pillar

Oakhurst aside Still silent Poor dove I can hear her foolish heart
flutter against mine Another moment decides our fate Another moment
John Oakhurst and freedom or Red Gulch andshe is moving To JOVITA
I am harsh little one and cold Perhaps I have had much to make me so
But when with feeling I first met you when lifting my eyes to the
churchporch I saw your beautiful face when in sheer recklessness
and bravado I raised my hat to you when youyou Jovitalifted
your brave eyes to mine and there there in the sanctuary returned
my salutethe salutation of the gambler the outcast the
reprobatethen then I swore that you should be mine if I tore you
from the sanctuary Speak now Jovita if it was coquetry speak now I
forgive you if it was sheer wantonness speak now I shall spare you
but if

Jovita throwing herself in his arms Love Juan I am yours now
and forever Pause But you have not told me all I will go with you
tonightnow I leave behind me allmy home my father mypause
my name You have forgotten Juan you have not told me what I change
THAT for you have not told me YOURS

OLD MORTON in eager excitement leans beyond shadow of pillar

Oakhurst embracing her tenderly with a smile If I have not told you
who I am it was because darling it was more important that you should
know what I am Now that you know thatwhyembarrassedly I
have nothing more to tell I did not wish you to repeat the name of
Oakhurstbecauseaside how the Devil shall I tell her that Oakhurst
was my real name after all and that I only feared she might divulge
italoud becausebecausedeterminedly I doubted your ability
to keep a secret My real name islooks up and sees MORTON leaning
beyond pillar is a secret Pause in which OAKHURST slowly recovers
his coolness It will be given to the good priest who tonight joins
our fate forever Jovitaforever in spite of calumny opposition
or SPIES the padre whom we shall reach if enough life remains in your
pulse and mine to clasp these hands together After a pause Are you
content

Jovita I am

Oakhurst Then there is not a moment to lose Retire and prepare
yourself for a journey I will wait here

Jovita I am ready now

Oakhurst looking toward pillar Pardon my darling there was a
braceleta mere trifleI once gave you It is not on your wrist I
am a trifle superstitious perhaps it was my first gift Bring it with
you I will wait Go

Exit JOVITA

OAKHURST watches her exit lounges indifferently toward gate when
opposite pillar suddenly seizes MORTON by the throat and drags him
noiselessly to centre

Oakhurst hurriedly One outcrya single wordand it is your last
I care not who YOU may bewho I amyou have heard enough to know
at least that you are in the grip of a desperate man Keys fall from
MORTONS hand OAKHURST seizes them Silence on your life

Morton struggling You would not dare I command you

Oakhurst dragging him to gateway Out you must go

Morton Stop I command you I never turned MY father out of doors

Oakhurst gazing at MORTON It is an OLD man I release you Do as you
will only remember that that girl is mine forever that there is no
power on earth will keep me from her

Morton On conditions

Oakhurst Who are you that make conditions You are nother father

Morton No but I am YOURS Alexander Morton I charge you to hear me

Oakhurst starting in astonishment aside Sandy Morton my lost
partners father This is fate

Morton You are astonished but I thought so Ay you will hear me now
I am your father Alexander Morton who drove you a helpless boy into
disgrace and misery I know your shameless life for twenty years it was
mine and worse until by the grace of God I reformed as you shall
I have stopped you in a disgraceful act Your motherGod forgive
meleft HER house for MY arms as wickedly as wantonly as
shamelessly

Oakhurst Stop old man Stop Another word seizing him and I may
forget your years

Morton But not your blood No Alexander Morton I have come thousands
of miles for one sacred purposeto save you and I shall with Gods
will do it now Be it so on one condition You shall have this girl
but lawfully openly with the sanction of Heaven and your parents

Oakhurst aside I see a ray of hope This is Sandys father the cold
insensate brute who drove him into exile the one bitter memory of
his life Sandy disappeared irreclaimable or living alone hating
irrevocably the author of his misery why should not I

Morton continuing On one condition Hear me Alexander Morton If
within a year you abandoning your evil practices your wayward life
seek to reform beneath my roof I will make this proud Spanish Don glad
to accept you as the more than equal of his daughter

Oakhurst aside It would be an easy deception Sandy has given me
the details of his early life At least before the imposition was
discovered I shall be Aloud II Aside Perdition SHE is
coming There is a light moving in the upper chamber Don Jose is
awakened Aloud IIaccept

Morton It is well Take these keys open yonder gate and fly As
OAKHURST hesitates Obey me I will meet your sweetheart and
explain all You will come here at daylight in the morning and claim
admittance not as a vagabond a housebreaker but as my son You
hesitate Alexander Morton I your father command you Go

OAKHURST goes to the gate opens it as the sound of DIEGOS voice
singing in the fog comes faintly in


 O yers your Sandy Morton
 Drink him down
 O yers your Sandy Morton
 Drink him down
 O yers your Sandy Morton
 For hes drunk and goin acourtin
 O yers your Sandy Morton
 Drink him down


OAKHURST recoils against gate MORTON hesitates as window in corridor
opens and DON JOSE calls from upper corridor

Don Jose Concho Pause Tis that vagabond Diego lost his way in the
fog Strange that Concho should have overlooked him I will descend

Morton to OAKHURST Do you hear

Exit OAKHURST through gateway MORTON closes gate and returns to
centre Enter JOVITA hurriedly

Jovita I have it here Quick there is a light in Don Joses chamber
my father is coming down Sees MORTON and screams

Morton seizing her Hush for your own sake for HIS control
yourself He is gone but he will return To JOVITA still struggling
Hush I beg Miss Jovita I beg I command you my daughter Hush

Jovita whispering His voice has changed What does this mean
Aloud Where has he gone and why are YOU here

Morton slowly and seriously He has left me here to answer the
unanswered question you asked him Enter Don Jose and Col STARBOTTLE
R and L I am here to tell you that I am his father and that he is
Alexander Morton

gravitation Good idea Ged say it to schoolmaam Wonder what shes

obscurity this miserable old lunatic commissions ME to hunt up another

Enter MISS MARY L reading letter

Miss Mary Strange Is it all a dream No here are the familiar rocks
the distant snowpeaks the schoolhouse the spring below An hour ago
I was the poor schoolmistress of Red Gulch with no ambition nor hope
beyond this mountain wall and nowoh it must be a dream But here
is the letter Certainly this is no delusion it is too plain formal
businesslike Reads

and her husband John Morris both deceased It is my duty as a Christian
relative to provide you with a hometo share with you that wealth and
those blessings that a kind providence has vouchsafed me I am aware
that my conduct to your father and mother while in my sinful and
unregenerate state is no warrantee for my present promise but my
legal adviser Col Starbottle who is empowered to treat with you will
assure you of the sincerity of my intention and my legal ability to
perform it He will conduct you to my house you will share its roof
with me and my prodigal son Alexander now by the grace of God restored
and mindful of the error of his ways I enclose a draft for one thousand
dollars if you require more draw upon me for the same

Your cousin

ALEXANDER MORTON SEN


My mothers cousinso Cousin Alexander a rich man and reunited
to the son he drove into shameful exile Well we will see this
confidential lawyer and until thenuntil thenwhy we are the
schoolmistress of Red Gulch and responsible for its youthful prodigals
Going to schoolhouse door

Miss Mary stopping to examine flowers Poor poor Sandy Another
offering and as he fondly believes unknown and anonymous As if he
were not visible in every petal and leaf The mariposa blossom of the
plain The snowflower I longed for from those cool snowdrifts beyond
the ridge And I really believe he was sober when he arranged them Poor
fellow I begin to think that the dissipated portion of this community
are the most interesting Ah some one behind the rockSandy Ill
wager No a stranger

Col Starbottle aside and advancing If I could make her think I
left those flowers Aloud When I state thaterI am
perhapserstranger

Miss Mary interrupting him coldly You explain sir your appearance
on a spot which the rude courtesy of even this rude miners camp has
preserved from intrusion

Starbottle slightly abashed but recovering himself YesGedthat
is Iersaw you admiringertributeerhumble tribute of
flowers I am myself passionately devoted to flowers Ged Ive
spent hoursinerbending over theergraceful sunflower
inerplucking the timid violet from the overhanging but reluctant
bough in collecting theererfaunaI mean theerfloraof
thiserdistrict

Miss Mary who has been regarding him intently Permit me to leave you
in uninterrupted admiration of them Handing him flowers You
will have ample time in your journey down the gulch to indulge your
curiosity

Hands STARBOTTLE flowers enters schoolhouse and quietly closes door on
STARBOTTLE as SANDY MORTON enters cautiously and sheepishly from left
SANDY stops in astonishment on observing STARBOTTLE and remains by wing
left

Starbottle smelling flowers and not noticing MISS MARYS absence
Beautifulerexquisite Looking up at closed door Ged Most
extraordinary disappearance Looks around and discovers SANDY
examines him for a moment through his eyeglass and then after a pause
inflates his chest turns his back on SANDY and advances to schoolhouse
door SANDY comes quickly and as STARBOTTLE raises his cane to rap on
door seizes his arm Both men regarding each other fixedly holding
each other retreat slowly and cautiously to centre Then STARBOTTLE
disengages his arm

Sandy embarrassedly but determinedly Look yer stranger By the rules
of this camp this place is sacred to the schoolmaam and her children

Starbottle with lofty severity It is Thenerpermit me to ask
sir what YOU are doing here

Sandy embarrassed and dropping his head in confusion I waspassing
There is no school today

Starbottle Then sir Ged permit me toerDEMANDDEMAND siran
apology You have laid sir your hand upon my persondemn me Not
the first time sir either for if I am not mistaken you are
theerinebriated menial sir who two months ago jostled me
sirdemn meas I entered the rancho of my friend Don Jose Castro

Sandy starting aside Don Jose Aloud Hush hush She will hear
you Nothat isstops confused and embarrassed Aside She will
hear of my disgrace He will tell her the whole story

Starbottle I shall await your apology one hour At the end of that
time if it is not forthcoming I shallererwaive your menial
antecedents and expect theersatisfaction of a gentleman
Goodmorning sir Turns to schoolhouse

Sandy No no you shall not go

Starbottle Who will prevent me

Sandy grappling him I will Appealingly Look yer stranger dont
provoke me I a desperate man desperate and crazed with drinkdont
ye dont ye do it For Gods sake take your hands off me Ye dont
know what ye do Ah Wildly holding STARBOTTLE firmly and forcing him
backward to precipice beyond ledge of rocks Hear me Three years ago
in a moment like this I dragged a manmy friendto this precipice
IIno nodont anger me now Sandys grip on STARBOTTLE relaxes
slightly and his head droops

Starbottle coolly Permit me to remark sir that any reminiscence of
yourerfriendor any other man iserat this moment irrelevant
and impertinent Permit me to point out theerfact sir that your
hand is pressing heavily demned heavily on my shoulder

Sandy fiercely You shall not go

Starbottle fiercely Shall not

Struggle STARBOTTLE draws derringer from his breastpocket and SANDY
seizes his arm In this position both parties struggle to ledge of
rocks and COL STARBOTTLE is forced partly over

Miss Mary opening schoolhouse door I thought I heard voices Looking
toward ledge of rocks where COL STARBOTTLE and SANDY are partly hidden
by trees Both men relax grasp of each other at MISS MARYS voice

Col Starbottle aloud and with voice slightly raised to SANDY
Byerleaning over this way a moment a single moment you
willerperceive the trail I speak of It follows the canyon to the
right It will bring you toerthe settlement in an hour To
MISS MARY as if observing her for the first time I believe I
amerright but beingermore familiar with the locality you can
direct the gentleman better

SANDY slowly sinks on his knees beside rock with his face averted
from schoolhouse as COL STARBOTTLE disengages himself and advances
jauntily and gallantly to schoolhouse

Col Starbottle Inerershowing the stranger theerway I
perhaps interrupted our interview Theerobservances ofercivility
and humanity must not be foregone even forerthe ladies
Ierbelieve I address Miss Mary Morris When Ierstate that my
name is Col Starbottle charged on mission oferdelicate nature I
believe Ierexplain MY intrusion

MISS MARY bows and motions to schoolhouse door COL STARBOTTLE bowing
deeply enters but MISS MARY remains standing by door looking toward
trees that hide SANDY

Miss Mary aside I am sure it was Sandys voice But why does he
conceal himself

Sandy aside rising slowly to his feet with his back to schoolhouse
door Even this conceited bully overcomes me and shames me with his
readiness and tact He was quick to spare hera strangerthe spectacle
of two angry men IImust needs wrangle before her very door Well
well better out of her sight forever than an object of pity or terror
Exit slowly and with downcast eyes right

Miss Mary watching the trail It WAS Sandy and this concealment means
something more than bashfulness Perhaps the stranger can explain

Enters schoolhouse and closes door

I am here toerexpress its spirit I am here with great
gallantry to express theeryearnings of cousinly affection I
am awareerthat OUR conductif I may use theerthe plural of
advocacyI am aware thaterOUR conduct has not in the past years
been ofererexemplary character I am aware that theerdeath
of our lamented cousin your sainted mother waserhastenedI
mayersayprecipitatedby ourerindiscretion But we are
heretoerconfess judgmentwitherercosts

Miss Mary interrupting In other words your client my cousin having
ruined my father having turned his own widowed relation out of doors
and sent me her daughter among strangers to earn her bread having
seen my mother sink and die in her struggle to keep her family from
wantthis man now seeks to condone his offencespardon me sir if I
use your own legal phraseologyby offering me a home by giving me part
of his illgotten wealth the association of his own hypocritical self
and the company of his shameless profligate son

Starbottle interrupting A moment Miss Morrisa single moment
The epithets you have used theervigorous characterization of
ourerconduct iserwithin theerstrict rules of legal
advocacy correct We areerrascals we areerscoundrels we
areerwell I am noterprepared to say that we are noterdemn
mehypocrites But the young man you speak ofour son whose past
life speaking as Col Starbottle no one more sincerely deprecates than
myselfthat young man has reformed has been for the past few months
a miracle of sobriety decorum and industry has taken thanks to
the example oferfriends a position of integrity in his fathers
business of filial obedience in his fathers household is in short a
paragon and demn me I doubt if hes his fathers son

Miss Mary Enough sir You are waiting for my answer There is no
reason why it should not be as precise as brief and as formal as your
message Go to my cousin say that you saw the person he claims as
his relation say that you found her a poor schoolmistress in a rude
mining camp dependent for her bread on the scant earnings of already
impoverished men dependent for her honor on the rude chivalry of
outcasts and vagabonds and say that then and there she repudiated your
kinship and respectfully declined your invitation

Starbottle aside Ged Star this is theerfemale of your species
This is the womantheerone womanfor whom you are responsible
sirpersonally responsible

Miss Mary coldly You have my answer sir

Col Starbottle Permit meersingle momenta single moment
Between the erpresent moment and that of my departurethere
is anerinterval of twelve hours May I at the close of that
intervalagain present myselfwithout prejudice for your final
answer

Miss Mary indifferently As you will sir I shall be here

Col Starbottle Permit me Takes her hand gallantly Your conduct
and manner Miss Morris remind meersingularlyofer beautiful
creatureone of theerfirst families Observing MISS MARY regarding
him amusedly becomes embarrassed That iserI meanerergood
morning Miss Morris Passes by schoolhouse door retreating and
bowing and picks up flowers from doorstep Good morning

Miss Mary Excuse me Col Starbottle with winning politeness but
I fear I must rob you of those flowers I recognize them now as the
offering of one of my pupils I fear I must revoke my gift taking
flowers from astonished colonels hand all except a single one for
your buttonhole Have you any choice or shall I archly choose for
you Then it shall be this Begins to place flowers in buttonhole
COL STARBOTTLE exhibiting extravagant gratitude in dumb show Business
prolonged through MISS MARYs speech If I am not wrong colonel the
gentleman to whom you so kindly pointed out the road this morning was
not a stranger to you Ah I am right There one momenta sprig of
green a single leaf would set off the pink nicely Here he is known
only as Sandy you know the absurd habits of this camp Of course he
has another name There releasing the colonel it is much prettier
now

Col Starbottle Ged madam The rarest exoticthe Victoria Reginais
not asergracefulertribute

Miss Mary And yet you refuse to satisfy my curiosity

Col Starbottle with great embarrassment which at last resolves itself
into increased dignity of manner What you ask isererimpossible
You are right theergentleman you allude to is known to me
underereranother name But honorMiss Morris honorseals the
lips of Col Starbottle Aside If she should know he was a menial
No The position of the man you have challenged Star must be equal to
your own Aloud Anything Miss Morris buterthat

Miss Mary smiling Be it so Adios Col Starbottle

Col Starbottle gallantly Au revoir Miss Morris Exit
impressively L

Miss Mary So Sandy conceals another name which he withholds from
Red Gulch Well Pshaw What is that to me The camp is made up of
refugeesmen who perhaps have good reason to hide a name that may
be infamous the name that would publish a crime Nonsense Crime and
Sandy No shame and guilt do not hide themselves in those honest but
occasionally somewhat bloodshot eyes Besides goodness knows the poor
fellows weakness is palpable enough No that is not the reason It
is no guilt that keeps his name hiddenat least not his Seating
herself and arranging flowers in her lap Poor Sandy he must have
climbed the eastern summit to get this See the rosy sunrise still
lingers in its very petals the dew is fresh upon it Dear little
mountain baby I really believe that fellow got up before daylight to
climb that giddy height and secure its virgin freshness And to think
in a moment of spite Id have given it to that bombastic warrior
Pause That was a fine offer you refused just now Miss Mary Think of
it a home of luxury a position of assured respect and homage the life
I once led with all its difficulties smoothed away its uncertainty
dispelledthink of it My poor mothers dream fulfilledI her
daughter the mistress of affluence the queen of social power What
a temptation Ah Miss Mary WAS it a temptation Was there nothing
in your free life here that stiffened your courage that steeled the
adamant of your refusal or was it only the memory of your mothers
wrongs Luxury and wealth Could you command a dwelling more charming
than this Position and respect Is not the awful admiration of these
lawless men more fascinating than the perilous flattery of gentlemen
like Col Starbottle is not the devotion of these outcasts more
complimentary than the lipservice of perfumed gallantry Pause
Its very odd he doesnt come I wonder if that conceited old fool said
anything to him Rises and then seats herself smiling He HAS COME
He is dodging in and out of the manganita bushes below the spring I
suppose he imagines my visitor still here The bashful fool If anybody
should see him it would be enough to make a petty scandal Ill give
him a talkingto Pause I wonder if the ridiculous fool has gone
to sleep in those bushes Rises Well let him it will help him to
recover his senses from last nights dissipation and you Miss Mary
it is high time you were preparing the lessons for tomorrow Goes
to schoolhouse enters door and slams it behind her after a moment
reappears with empty bucket Of course theres no water and I am dying
of thirst Goes slowly to left and pauses embarrassedly and bashfully
presently laughsthen suddenly frowns and assumes an appearance of
indignation Miss Mary Morris have you become such an egregious fool
that you dare not satisfy the ordinary cravings of human nature
just because an idle dissipated bashful blockheadnonsense Exit
brandishing pail


SCENE 3The Same

A pause SANDYS voice without This way miss the trail is easier

MISS MARYS voice without Never mind me look after the bucket

Enter SANDY carrying bucket with water followed by MISS MARY SANDY
sets bucket down

Miss Mary There youve spilt half of it If it had been whiskey youd
have been more careful

Sandy submissively Yes miss

Miss Mary aside Yes miss The man will drive me crazy with his
saccharine imbecility Aloud I believe you would assent to anything
even if I said you werean impostor

Sandy amazedly An impostor Miss Mary

Miss Mary Well I dont know what other term you use in Red Gulch to
express a man who conceals his real name under another

Sandy embarrassed but facing MISS MARY Has anybody been tellin ye I
was an impostor miss Has thet derned old fool that I saw ye with

Miss Mary That old fool as you call him was too honorable a
gentleman to disclose your secret and too loyal a friend to traduce
you by an epithet Fear nothing Mr Sandy if you have limited your
confidence to ONE friend it has not been misplaced But dear me dont
think I wish to penetrate your secret No The little I learned was
accidental Besides his business was with me perhaps as his friend
you already know it

Sandy meekly Perhaps miss he was too honorable a gentleman to
disclose YOUR secret His business was with me

Miss Mary aside He has taken a leaf out of my book He is not so
stupid after all Aloud I have no secret Col Starbottle came here
to make me an offer

Sandy recoiling An offer

Miss Mary Of a home and independence Aside Poor fellow how pale he
looks Aloud Well you see I am more trustful than you I will tell
you MY secret and you shall aid me with your counsel They sit on
ledge of rocks Listen My mother had a cousin oncea cousin cruel
cowardly selfish and dissolute She loved him as women are apt to
love such menloved him so that she beguiled her own husband to trust
his fortunes in the hands of this wretched profligate The husband
was ruined disgraced The wife sought her cousin for help for her
necessities He met her with insult and proposed that she should fly
with him

Sandy One moment miss it wasnt his pardnerhis pardners wifeeh

Miss Mary impatiently It was the helpless wife of his own blood
I tell you The husband died brokenhearted The wife my mother
struggled in poverty under the shadow of a proud name to give me an
education and died while I was still a girl Today this cousinthis
more than murderer of my parentsold rich selfsatisfied REFORMED
invites me by virtue of that kinship he violated and despised to his
home his wealth hishis family rooftree The man you saw was his
agent

Miss Mary rising with agitation Nothingnothing but climbing

impatiently Cant you give me your arm SANDY supports MISS MARY
awkwardly toward schoolhouse At door MISS MARY pauses But if
reformation is so easy so acceptable why have you not profited by
it Why have you not reformed Why have I found you here a disgraced
dissipated anonymous outcast whom an honest girl dare not know Why do
you presume to preach to me Have you a father

Sandy Hush Miss Mary hush I had a father Harkin All that you have
suffered from a kinship even so far removed I have known from the hands
of one who should have protected me MY father wasbut no matter You
Miss Mary came out of your trials like gold from the washing I was
only the dirt and gravel to be thrown away It is too late Miss Mary
too late My father has never sought me would turn me from his doors
had I sought him Perhaps he is only right

Miss Mary But why should he be so different from others Listen This
very cousin whose offer I refused had a sonwild wayward by all
report the most degraded of men It was part of my cousins reformation
to save this son and if it were possible snatch him from that
terrible fate which seemed to be his only inheritance

Sandy eagerly Yes miss

Miss Mary To restore him to a regenerated home With this idea he
followed his prodigal to California I you understand was only an
afterthought consequent upon his success He came to California upon
this pilgrimage two years ago He had no recollection so they tell me
by which he could recognize this erring son and at first his search
was wild profitless and almost hopeless But by degrees and with
a persistency that seemed to increase with his hopelessness he was
rewarded by finding some clew to him atatat

Sandy excitedly At Poker Flat

Miss Mary Ah perhaps you know the storyat Poker Flat He traced him
to the Mission of San Carmel

Sandy Yes miss go on

Miss Mary He was more successful than he deserved perhaps He found
him I see you know the story

story of this helpless man this poor poor reckless Sandy With the

MORTON sen discovered at desk R opening and reading letters

Morton sen laying down letter Well well the usual story letters
from all sorts of people who have done or intend to do all sorts of
things for my reclaimed prodigal Reads Dear Sir five years ago
I loaned some money to a stranger who answers the description of your
recovered son He will remember Jim ParkerLimping Jim of Poker Flat
Being at present short of funds please send twenty dollars amount
loaned by return mail If not convenient five dollars will do as
instalment Pshaw Throws letter aside and takes up another Dear
Sir I invite your attention to enclosed circular for a proposed Home
for Dissipated and Anonymous GoldMiners Your wellknown reputation for
liberality and your late valuable experience in the reformation of your
son will naturally enlist your broadest sympathies We enclose a draft
for five thousand dollars for your signature We shall see Another
Dear Sir the Society for the Formation of Bible Classes in the Upper
Stanislaus acknowledge your recent munificent gift of five hundred
dollars to the cause Last Sabbath Brother Hawkins of Poker Flat related
with touching effect the story of your prodigal to an assemblage of over
two hundred miners Owing to unusual expenses we regret to be compelled
to draw upon you for five hundred dollars more So Putting down
letter If we were given to pride and vainglory we might well be
puffed up with the fame of our works and the contagion of our example
yet I fear that with the worldlyminded this praise of charity to
others is only the prayerful expectation of some personal application to
the praiser Rings handbell

Enter JACKSON

To JACKSON File these letters handing letters with the others
There is no answer Has young Mr Alexander come in yet

Jackson He only left here an hour ago It was steamer day yesterday he
was up all night sir

bank a hundred thousand dollars Certainly his devotion to business is
unremitting Aloud Any news from Col Starbottle

Old Morton takes it and reads I think I may say on my own personal
responsibility that the mission is successful Miss Morris will arrive
tonight with a female attendant and child To JACKSON That is all
sir Stop Has any one been smoking here

Jackson Not to my knowledge sir

Old Morton There was a flavor of stale tobacco smoke in the room this
morning when I entered and ashes on the carpet I KNOW that young Mr
Alexander has abandoned the pernicious habit See that it does not occur
again

Jackson Yes sir Aside I must warn Mr Alexander that his friends
must be more careful and yet those ashes were good for a deposit of
fifty thousand

Old Morton Is any one waiting

Jackson Yes sirDon Jose Castro and Mr Capper

Old Morton Show in the Don the policeman can wait

Jackson Yes sir Exit

Old Morton taking up STARBOTTLES note Miss Morris will arrive
tonight And yet he saw her only yesterday This is not like her
mother no She would never have forgiven and forgotten so quickly
Perhaps she knew not my sin and her mothers wrongs perhaps she
hashasCHRISTIAN forgiveness sarcastically perhaps like my
prodigal she will be immaculately perfect Well well at least her
presence will make my home less lonely An attendant and child A
child Ah if HE my boy my Alexander were still a child I might warm
this cold cold heart in his sunshine Strange that I cannot reconstruct
from this dutiful submissive obedient industrious Alexanderthis
redeemed outcast this son who shares my life my fortunes my
heartthe foolish wilful thoughtless idle boy that once defied me
I remember musing with a smile how the little rascal ha ha once
struck meSTRUCK MEwhen I corrected him ha ha Rubbing his hands
with amusement and then suddenly becoming grave and lugubrious No
no These are the whisperings of the flesh Why should I find fault with
him for being all that a righteous conversion demandsall that I asked
and prayed for No Alexander Morton it is you YOU who are not yet
regenerate It is YOU who are ungrateful to Him who blessed you to Him
whose guiding hand led you to

he did not believe young Mr Alexander was your son An hour later
sir he also imparted to me confidentially that he believed you were his
father and requested the loan of five dollars to be repaid by you
to enable him to purchase a clean shirt and appear before you in
respectable condition He waited for you an hour and expressed some
indignation that he had not an equal show with others to throw himself
into your arms

Don Jose rising aside and uplifting his hands Carramba These
Americanos are of the Devil Aloud Enough Don Alexandro Then you
think this letter is only worth

Old Morton One moment I can perhaps tell you exactly its market value
To JACKSON Go on sir

Jackson At halfpast ten sir then being slightly under the influence
of liquor he accepted the price of a deck passage to Stockton

Old Morton How much was that sir

Jackson Fifty cents

Old Morton Exactly so There you have sir to DON JOSE the market
value of the information you have received I would advise you as a
business matter not to pay more As a business matter you can at any
time draw upon us for the amount To JACKSON Admit Mr Capper Exit
JACKSON

Don Jose rising with dignity This is an insult Don Alexandro

Old Morton You are wrong Mr Castro it is BUSINESS sought I
believe by yourself Now that it is transacted I beg you to dine with
me tomorrow to meet my niece No offence sir no offence Come come
Business you know business

Don Jose relaxing Be it so I will come Aside These Americanos
these Americanos are of the Devil Aloud Adios Going I hear
by report that you have met with the misfortune of a serious loss by
robbery

Old Morton aside So our mishap is known everywhere Aloud No
serious misfortune Mr Castro even if we do not recover the money
Adios

Exit Don Jose

Old Morton The stiffnecked Papist That he should dare for the sake
of his blackbrowed froward daughter toquestion the faith on which
I have pinned my future Well with Gods blessing I gave him some
wholesome discipline If it were not for my covenant with Alexanderand
nobly he has fulfilled his partI should forbid his alliance with the
blood of this spying Jesuit

Enter Mr JACKSON leading in CAPPER

Jackson Policeman sir Exit

Capper turning sharply Whos that man

Old Morton Jackson clerk

Capper Umph Been here long

Old Morton A year He was appointed by my son

Capper Know anything of his previous life

Old Morton stiffly I have already told you he is an appointee of my
sons

Capper Yes Aside Like master like man Aloud Well
to business We have worked up the robbery We have reached two
conclusionsone that the work was not done by professionals the
other consequent upon this that you cant recover the money

Old Morton Excuse me sir but I do not see the last conclusion

Capper Then listen The professional thief has only one or two ways of
disposing of his plunder and these ways are always well known to us
Good Your stolen coin has not been disposed of in the regular way
through the usual hands which we could at any time seize Of this we are
satisfied

Old Morton How do you know it

Capper In this way The only clew we have to the identification of the
missing money were two boxes of Mexican doubloons

Old Morton aside Mr Castros special deposit He may have reason for
his interest Aloud Go on

Capper It is a coin rare in circulation in the interior The night
after the robbery the dealer of a montetable in Sacramento paid out
five thousand dollars in doubloons He declared it was taken in at the
table and could not identify the players Of course OF COURSE So far
you see you are helpless We have only established one fact that the
robber isissignificantly a gambler

Old Morton quietly The regular trade of the thief seems to me to be
of little importance if you cannot identify him or recover my money
But go on sir go on or is this all

Capper aside The old fool is blind That is natural Aloud It is
not all The crime will doubtless be repeated The man who has access
to your vaults who has taken only thirty thousand dollars when he could
have secured half a millionthis man who has already gambled that
thirty thousand awaywill not stop there He will in a day or two
perhaps today try to retrieve his losses out of YOUR capital I am
here to prevent it

Old Morton becoming interested How

Capper Give me for fortyeight hours free access to this building
Let me conceal myself somewhere anywhere within these walls Let it be
without the knowledge of your clerks even of YOUR SON

Old Morton proudly Mr Alexander Morton is absent today There is
no other reason why he should not be here to consent to the acts of his
partner and father

Capper quickly Very good It is only to insure absolute secrecy

Old Morton aside Another robbery might excite a suspicion worse
for our credit than our actual loss There is a significant earnestness
about this man that awakens my fears If Alexander were only here
Aloud I accept CAPPER has been trying doors R and L

Capper What room is this At R

Old Morton My sons I would prefer

Capper And this At L

Old Morton Mine sir if you choose

Capper locking door and putting key in his pocket This will do
Oblige me by making the necessary arrangements in your countingroom

Old Morton hesitating and aside He is right perhaps it is only
prudence and I am saving Alexander additional care and annoyance
Exit

Enter MR SHADOW cautiously C

Shadow in a lisping whisper to CAPPER Ive got the litht of the
clerkth complete

Capper triumphantly Put it in your pocket Shadow We dont care for
the lackeys now we are after the master

Shadow Eh the mathter

Capper Yes the masterthe young master the reclaimed son the

Oakhurst and when I found the old mans doubloons raked over a
montetable at Sacramento I knew where to look for the thief Eh
Shadow

Shadow aside He ith enormouth thith Mithter Capper

Enter OLD MORTON

Old Morton I have arranged everything You will not be disturbed or
suspected here in my private office Eh Looking at SHADOW Who has

Capper Only my Shadow Mr Morton but I can rid myself even of that
Crosses to SHADOW Take this card to the office and wait for further
orders Vanish Shadow Exit SHADOW

Enter JACKSON

Jackson Mr Alexander has come in sir OLD MORTON and CAPPER start

Old Morton Where is he

Jackson In his private room sir

Old Morton Enough you can go

Exit JACKSON

Capper crossing to MORTON Remember you have given your pledge of
secrecy Beware Your honor your property the credit and reputation of
your bank are at stake

Old Morton after a pause of hesitation with dignity I gave you
my word sir while my son was not present I shall save myself
from breaking my word with you or concealing anything from him by
withdrawing myself For the next twentyfour hours this room pointing
to private room R is yours

Each regards the other Exit OLD MORTON C as CAPPER exit in private
room R After a pause door of room L opens and HARRY YORK appears
slightly intoxicated followed by JOHN OAKHURST

Harry York looking around By Jove Morton but youve got things in
style here And this yers the govnors desk and here old Praise
god Barebones sits opposite ye Look yer old boy throwing himself in
chair I kin allow how it comes easy for ye to run this bank for its
about as exciting these times as faro was to ye in 49 when I first
knew ye as Jack Oakhurst but how the Devil you can sit opposite that
stiff embodiment of all the Ten Commandments day by day damn it
thats wot GETS me Why the first day I came here on business the
old man froze me so that I couldnt thaw a deposit out of my pocket It
chills me to think of it

Oakhurst hastily I suppose I am accustomed to him But come Harry
let me warm you Opens door of safe L and discovers cupboard
decanter and glasses

York laughing By Jove under the old mans very nose Jack this is
like you Takes a drink Well old boy this is like old times But
you dont drink

Oakhurst No nor smoke The fact is Harry Ive taken a years pledge
Ive six days still to run after that gloomily why with a reckless
laugh I shall be Jack Oakhurst again

York Lord to think of your turning out to be anybodys son
Jackleast of all HIS Pointing to chair

Oakhurst laughing recklessly Not more strange than that I should find
Harry York the spendthrift of Poker Flat the rich and respected Mr
York produce merchant of San Francisco

York Yes but my boy you see I didnt strike itin a rich father I
gave up gambling married and settled down saved my money invested a
little here and there andworked for it Jack damn meworked for it
like a damned horse

Oakhurst aside True this is not work

York But that aint my business with ye now old boy its this Youve
had some trials and troubles in the bank latelya defalcation of
agents one day a robbery next Its luck my boy luck but ye know
people will talk You dont mind my sayin that theres rumors round
The old mans mighty unpopular because hes a saint and folks dont
entirely fancy you because you used to be the reverse Well Jack it
amounts to bout this Ive withdrawn my account from Parkinsons in
Sacramento and Ive got a pretty heavy balance on handnigh on two
hundred thousandin bonds and certificates here and if it will help
you over the rough places old boy as a deposit yer it is drawing
pocketbook

Oakhurst greatly affected but endeavoring to conceal it Thank you
Harry old fellowbut

York quickly I know Ill take the risk a business risk Youll
stand by me all you can old boy youll make it pay all you can and if
you lose itwhyall right

Oakhurst embarrassed As a deposit with Morton  Son drawing two per
cent monthly interest

York Damn Morton  Son Ill back it with Jack Oakhurst the man I
know

Oakhurst advancing slowly Ill take it Harry

York extending his hand Its a square game Jack

Oakhurst seizing his hand with repressed emotion Its a square game
Harry York if I live

York Then Ill travel Goodnight old boy Ill send my clerk around
in the morning to put things right Goodnight going

Oakhurst grasping YORKS hand One momentnonothing Goodnight
Exit YORK

OAKHURST follows him to door and then returns to desk throwing himself
in chair and burying his face in his hands

Oakhurst with deep feeling It needed but this to fill the measure of
my degradation I have borne the suspicions of the old mans enemies
the halfpitying halfcontemptuous sympathy of his friends even his
own cold heartless fanatical fulfilment of his sense of duty but
THISthis confidence from one who had most reason to scorn me this
trust from one who knew me as I WASthis is the hardest burden And
he too in time will know me to be an impostor He tooa reformed man
but he has honorably retraced his steps and won the position I hold
by a trick an imposture And what is all my labor beside his honest
sincerity I have fought against the chances that might discover my
deception against the enemies who would overthrow me against the
fate that put me here and I have been successfulyes a successful
impostor I have even fought against the human instinct that told this
fierce foolish old man that I was an alien to his house to his blood
I have even felt him scan my face eagerly for some reflection of his
longlost boy for some realization of his dream and I have seen him
turn away cold heartsick and despairing What matters that I have
been to him devoted untiring submissive ay a better son to him than
his own weak flesh and blood would have been He would tomorrow cast
me forth to welcome the outcast Sandy Morton Well what matters
Recklessly Nothing In six days it will be over in six days the year
of my probation will have passed in six days I will disclose to him the
deceit I have practised and will face the world again as John Oakhurst
the gambler who staked and lost ALL on a single cast And Jovita Well
wellthe game is made it is too late to draw out now Rings bell
Enter JACKSON Who has been here

Jackson Only Don Jose and Mr Capper the detective

Oakhurst The detective What for

Jackson To work up the robbery sir

Oakhurst True Capper Capper yes A man of wild and ridiculous
theories but wellmeaning brave and honest Aside This is the old
mans idea He does not know that I was on the trail of the thieves an
hour before the police were notified Aloud Well sir

Jackson He told your father he thought the recovery of the money
hopeless but he came to caution us against a second attempt

Oakhurst aside starting True I had not thought of that
Excitedly The success of their first attempt will incite them to
another the money they have stolen is gone by this time Aloud
Jackson I will stay here tonight and tomorrow night and relieve your
regular watchman You will of course say nothing of my intention

Jackson Yes sir Lingering

Oakhurst after a pause That is all Mr Jackson

Jackson Beg your pardon Mr Morton but Col Starbottle with two
ladies was here half an hour ago and said they would come again when
you were alone

Oakhurst Very well admit them

Jackson Beg pardon sir but they seemed to avoid seeing your father
until they had seen you It looked mysterious and I thought I would
tell you first

Oakhurst laughing Admit them Mr Jackson Exit JACKSON This
poor fellows devotion is increasing He too believes that his old
associate in dissipation John Oakhurst IS the son of Alexander Morton
He too will have to share in the disgrace of the impostor Ladies
umph Looking down at his clothes Im afraid the reform of Alexander
Morton hasnt improved the usual neatness of John Oakhurst I havent
slept nor changed my clothes for three days Goes to door of MORTON

Nonsense the old man has locked his door and gone out through the
private entrance Well Ill find means of making my toilet here Exit

assistance toward its natural protector You Miss Mary shall stand
here placing her as Moral Retribution leaning toward and slightly
appealing to me the image ofererInflexible Justice Inflates his
chest puts his hand in his bosom and strikes an attitude

Door of young Mortons room opens and discloses MR OAKHURST gazing at
the group He starts slightly on observing the DUCHESS but instantly
recovers himself and faces the company coldly The DUCHESS starts
on observing OAKHURST and struggles in confusion towards the door
dragging with her the child and MISS MARY who endeavors to reassure
her COL STARBOTTLE looks in astonishment from one to the other and
advances to front

Col Starbottle aside Theertableau although striking in moral
force is apparentlyerdeficient in moral stamina

Miss Mary angrily to the DUCHESS Im ashamed of you To OAKHURST
advancing I dont ask pardon for my intrusion If you are Alexander
Morton you are my kinsman and you will know that I cannot introduce
myself better than as the protector of an injured woman Come here To
the DUCHESS dragging her towards OAKHURST To OAKHURST Look upon this
woman she claims to be

Oakhurst calmly She is right

Miss Mary rushing forward Then you are

Oakhurst gently restraining her You have another question to ask you

answer Madam are you the legal wife of Alexander Morton

The Duchess sinking upon her knees and dropping her face in her
hands No

I have offended you

Oakhurst How can I believe you You have deceived HIM You have
deceived me Listen When I said a moment ago you were not the wife
of Alexander Morton it was because I knew that your first husbandthe
Australian convict Pritchardwas still living that you had deceived
Sandy Morton as you had deceived me That was why I left you Tell me
have you deceived me also about him as you did about the other Is HE
living and with you or dead as you declared

Oakhurst You swear

The Duchess hesitates gasps and looks around for her child then
seizing it and drawing it toward her Iswear

Oakhurst Enough Seek not to know why I am here and under his name
Enough for you that it has saved your childs future and secured him
his heritage past all revocation Yet remember a word from you within

Miss Mary sweeping truculently and aggressively up to JOHN OAKHURST
And permit ME to add sir that if you can see your way clearly out
of this wretched muddle its more than I can This arrangement may be
according to the Californian code of morality but it doesnt accord

you are absolved Goodnight Mr Alexander Morton Goes to door C
and exit pushing out STARBOTTLE the DUCHESS and child MR OAKHURST

Jackson I relieved the porter sir and I shall bunk on two chairs in
the countingroom Youll find me handy if you want me sir Goodnight
sir Exit C

Oakhurst I fear these rascals will not dare to make their second
attempt tonight A quiet scrimmage with them enough to keep me awake
or from thinking would be a good fortune No no no such luck for
you tonight John Oakhurst You are playing a losing game Yet
the robbery was a bold one At eleven oclock while the bank was yet
lighted and Mr Jackson and another clerk were at work here three
welldressed men pick the lock of the countinghouse door enter and
turn the key on the clerks in this parlor and carry away a box of
doubloons not yet placed in the vaults by the porter and all this done
so cautiously that the clerks within knew nothing of it until notified
of the open street door by the private watchman and so boldly that the
watchman seeing them here believed them clerks of the bank and let
them go unmolested No this was the coincidence of good luck not of
bold premeditation There will be no second attempt Yawns If they
dont come soon I shall fall asleep Four nights without rest will tell
on a man unless he has some excitement to back him Nods Hallo What
was that Oh Jackson in the countingroom getting to bed Ill look at
that front door myself Takes revolver from desk and goes to door C

Capper opening door of room L at the same moment that two policemen
appear at door C and two at room R You are wrong he has five
crossing to SILKY and SOAPY and laying his hands on their shoulders
and if I mistake not he has two more in these gentlemen whom I
know and who will be quite as willing to furnish the necessary States
evidence of the robbery as of the fact that they never knew any other
Alexander Morton than the gentleman who sits in that chair

Soapy Thats so Silky

unfortunate enough to draw theererunloaded pistol

Concho tremulously lowering weapon Eh Ah This is murder Drops

SCENE 4Front scene Room in villa Enter MISS MARY and JOVITA

Miss Mary I tell you you are wrong you are not only misunderstanding
your lover which is a womans privilege but you are abusing my cousin
which as his relative I wont put up with

Jovita passionately But hear me Miss Mary It is a year since we
were betrothed and such a betrothal Why I was signed sealed and
delivered to him on conditions as if I were a part of the rancho and
the very night too I had engaged to run away with him And during that
year I have seen the gentleman twiceyes twice

Miss Mary But he has written

Jovita Mother of God Yesletters delivered by my father sent to HIS
CARE read by him first of course letters hoping that I was well
and obeying my fathers commands letters assuring me of his unaltered
devotion letters that compared with the ones he used to hide in the
confessional of the ruined mission church were as ice to fire were
as that snowflower you value so much Mary to this mariposa blossom I
wear in my hair And then to think that this manthis John Oakhurst as
I knew him this man who used to ride twenty miles for a smile from me
on the church porch this Don Juan who leaped that garden wall fifteen
feet Mary if it is an inch and made old Concho his steppingstone
this man who daily perilled death for my sakeis changed into this
formal methodical man of businessisisI tell you theres a WOMAN
at the bottom of it I know it sure

Miss Mary aside How can I tell her about the Duchess I wont
Aloud But listen my dear Jovita You know he is under probation
for you Jovita All this is for you His father is cold methodical
unsympathetic HE looks only to his bond with this sonthis son
that he treats even in matters of the heart as a BUSINESS partner
Remember on his complete reformation and subjection to his fathers
will depends your hand Remember the agreement

Jovita The agreement yes It is the agreement always the agreement
May the Devil fly away with the agreement Look you Miss Mary I Dona
Jovita didnt fall in love with an agreement it was with a man Why I
might have married a dozen agreementsyes of a shorter limitation than
this Crossing

Miss Mary Yes But what if your lover had failed to keep those promises
by which he was to gain your hand what if he were a man incapable of
selfcontrol what if he wereaa drunkard

Jovita musing A drunkard Aside There was Diego he was a
drunkard but he was faithless Aloud You mean a weak faithless
drunkard

Miss Mary No Sadly Faithless only to himself but devotedyes
devoted to YOU

Jovita Miss Mary I have found that one big vice in a man is apt to
keep out a great many smaller ones

Miss Mary Yes but if he were a slave to liquor

Jovita My dear I should try to change his mistress Oh give me a
man that is capable of a devotion to anything rather than a cold
calculating average of all the virtues

Miss Mary aside I who aspire to be her teacher am only her pupil
Aloud But what if in this very drunkenness this recklessness he
had once loved and worshipped another woman What if you discovered all
this afterafterhe had won your heart

Jovita I should adore him Ah Miss Mary Love differs from all the
other contagious diseases the last time a man is exposed to it
he takes it most readily and has it the worst But you YOU cannot
sympathize with me You have some lover the ideal of the virtues some
man as correct as well regulated as calm asyourself some one
who addresses you in the fixed morality and severe penmanship of the
copybooks He will never precipitate himself over a garden wall or
through a window Your Jacob will wait for you through seven years and
receive you from the hands of your cousin and guardianas a reward of
merit No you could not love a vagabond

Miss Mary very slowly and quietly No

Jovita No Passionately No it is impossible Forgive me Miss Mary
you are good a better girl than I am But think of me A year ago my
lover leaped a wall at midnight to fly with me today the day that
gives me to him he writes a few cold lines saying that he has
business BUSINESSyou understandbusiness and that he shall not see
me until we meet in the presence ofofofour fathers

Miss Mary Yes but you will see him at least perhaps alone Listen it
is no formal meeting but one of festivity My guardian has told me in
his quaint scriptural way it is the killing of the fatted calf over
his longlost prodigal Have patience little one Ah Jovita we are
of a different race but we are of one sex and as a woman I know how to
accept another womans abuse of her lover Come come Exeunt MISS MARY
and JOVITA
