SceneThe dining room in the country house of James K Gardner
on Long Island In the back wall is a double doorway opening into
a hall A curtain divided in the middle hangs across the entrance
On the wall on either side of the doorway are two electric lights
and to the left is a telephone Further to the left is a
sideboard On it are set silver salvers candlesticks and
Christmas presents of silver They still are in the red flannel
bags in which they arrived In the left wall is a recessed window
hung with curtains Against the right wall is a buffet on which is
set a teacaddy toastrack and tea kettle Below the buffet a
door opens into the butlers pantry A dinner table stands well
down the stage with a chair at each end and on either side Two
chairs are set against the back wall to the right of the door The
walls and windows are decorated with holly and mistletoe and
Christmas wreaths tied with bows of scarlet ribbon When the
window is opened there is a view of falling snow At first the
room is in complete darkness

The time is the day after Christmas near midnight

After the curtain rises one hears the noise of a file scraping
on iron It comes apparently from outside the house at a point
distant from the dining room The filing is repeated cautiously
with a wait between each stroke as though the person using the
file had paused to listen

Alice Gardner enters at centre carrying a lighted candle in a
silver candlestick She wears a dressing gown with swans down
around her throat and at the edges of her sleeves Her feet are
in bedroom slippers topped with fur Her hair hangs down in a
braid After listening intently to the sound of the file she
places candle on sideboard and goes to telephone She speaks in a
whisper

 The file is now drawn harshly across the bolt of the window of the
 dining room and a piece of wood snaps With an exclamation Alice
 blows out the candle and exits The shutters of the windows are
 opened admitting the faint glow of moonlight The window is
 raised and the ray of a dark lantern is swept about the room
 HATCH appears at window and puts one leg inside He is an elderly
 man wearing a mask which hides the upper half of his face a heavy
 overcoat and a derby hat But for the mask he might be mistaken
 for a respectable man of business A pane of glass falls from the
 window and breaks on the sill

 HATCH
 Speaking over his shoulder
 Hush Be careful cant you
 He enters He is followed by GRAND STAND HARRY a younger man
 of sporting appearance He also wears a mask and the brim of his
 gray alpine hat is pulled over his eyes Around his throat he
 wears a heavy silk muffler

 HARRY

 REDDY appears at window He is dressed like a Bowery tough His
 face is blackened with burnt cork His hair is of a brilliant red
 He wears an engineers silk cap with visor To HARRY he passes a
 halffilled canvas bag On his shoulder he carries another On

 HARRY
 Contemptuously

 REDDY
 No I wont I did once but I didnt do it again for six years

 thief before hed wring a chickens neck hed give it laughing

 give her back a gold watch because it belonged to her little
 girl who was dead Wellit turned out the little girl wasnt
 dead It turned out the little girl was a big boy alive and

 REDDY
 About time he picked up something Remember the Gainesville Bank
 where he went away leaving ten thousand dollars in the back of the
 safe Why didnt he pick THAT up

 HATCH
 Because it wasnt there Bank directors always say thatto make
 us feel bad Hush

 HARRY enters carrying his silk muffler which now is wrapped
 about a collection of jewels and watches

 HATCH
 Thats quick work What did you get

 HARRY
 Some neck strings and rings and two watches

 He spreads the muffler on the table The three men examine the
 jewelry

 HATCH

 HARRY places muffler and jewels in an inside coat pocket REDDY
 takes up the dark lantern

 REDDY

 HATCH
 No you dont You can wait till later for something to eat

 REDDY
 Yes I can wait till later for something to eat but I can wait

 Exit into pantry

 HATCH
 Confound him If I knew the roads around here as well as he does
 Id drive off and leave him That appetite of his will send us to
 jail some day

 HARRY
 Well to tell the truth governor a little supper wouldnt hurt my
 feelings
 Goes to buffet
 I wonder where old man Gardner keeps his Havanas Id like a
 Christmas present of a box of cigars Are there any over here

 HATCH
 I didnt look I gave up robbing tills when I was quite a boy
 Carries bag toward window and looks out

 HARRY
 Takes box of cigars from buffet
 Ah here they are
 With disgust
 Domestics What do you think of that Made in Vermont The
 Admiral Dewey cigar Gee What was the use of Deweys taking
 Manila if Ive got to smoke Vermont cigars

 REDDY enters carrying tray with food and a bottle

 REDDY
 Say fellers look at this layout These is real people in this
 house I found cold birds and ham and all kinds of pie and real
 wine
 Places tray on right end of table
 Sit down and make yourselves perfectly at home

 HARRY
 Well well that does look good
 Places box of cigars at upper end of table and seats himself
 Better have a bite governor

 HATCH
 No I tell you
 He sits angrily in chair at left end of table with his face
 turned toward the curtains

 REDDY
 Oh come on It dont cost you nothing
 The light from the candle is seen approaching the curtains

 HATCH
 Hush Look there

 He rises lifting his chair above his head and advances on tiptoe
 to right of curtains where he stands with the chair raised as
 though to strike

 HARRY points revolver at curtains

 REDDY shifts the lantern to his left hand and standing close to
 HARRY also points a revolver

 ALICE appears between curtains She is dressed as before and in
 her left hand carries the candle while the forefinger of her right
 hand is held warningly to her lips For an instant she pauses in
 the ring of light from the lantern

 ALICE
 Whispering
 Hush Dont make a noise Dont make a noise please

 There is a long pause

 REDDY
 Well Ill be hung

 ALICE
 To REDDY
 Please dont make a noise

 HATCH
 in a threatening whisper
 Dont YOU make a noise

 ALICE

 either

 REDDY
 Well Ill be hung

 HATCH
 Angrily
 Who else is in this house

 ALICE
 No one but mother and the maid servants and theyre asleep You
 woke me and I hoped youd go without disturbing mother But when
 you started in making a night of it I decided Id better come down
 and ask you to be as quiet as possible My mother is not at all
 well
 Takes cigar box off table
 Excuse me youve got the wrong cigars Those are the cigars
 father keeps for his friends Those he smokes he hides over here
 Places box on buffet and takes out a larger box with partitions
 for cigars matches and cigarettes As she moves about REDDY
 keeps her well in the light of the lantern
 Try those Im afraid youve a very poor supper When father is
 away we have such a small family I cant see what youvewould
 you mind taking that light out of my eyes and pointing it at that
 tray

 HATCH
 sharply
 Dont you do it Keep the gun on her

 ALICE

 Sternly

 ALICE

 told Jane to take it away

 REDDY
 dryly
 Well Jane didnt do it

 ALICE

 the house and burn us alive

 REDDY
 It nearly burned me alive

 ALICE

 Takes from buffet a tray holding whiskey bottle siphon and three
 glasses

 Returns to chair at left of table

 REDDY

 ALICE
 pours whiskey into a glass

 bottle If youre afraid Ill prove it to you Just to show you

 Drinks and coughs violently

 REDDY
 sympathetically

 To HARRY

 Exit into pantry

 HATCH

 ALICE
 arranging the food upon the table
 Now why are you so peevish to everybody Why dont you be
 sociable and take some supper
 Glances at sideboard
 You seem to have taken everything else Oh that reminds me
 Would you object to loaning me aboutfour sixabout six of our
 knives and forks Just for the supper I suppose we can borrow
 from the neighbors for breakfast Unless youve been calling on
 the neighbors too

 HATCH
 Oh anything to oblige a lady
 Threateningly
 But no tricks now

 ALICE
 Oh I cant promise that because I mightnt be able to keep my
 promise

 HATCH brings silver knives and forks from the bag

 HATCH
 Ill risk all the tricks you know Nobodys got much the better of
 me in the last twenty years

 ALICE
 Have you been a burglar twenty years You must have begun very
 young I cant see your face very well but I shouldnt say you
 wereover forty Do take that mask off It looks sounsociable
 Dont be afraid of me Ive a perfectly shocking memory for faces
 Now Im sure that under that unbecoming and terrifying exterior
 you are hiding a kind and fatherly countenance Am I right
 Laughs
 Why do you wear it

 HATCH
 roughly
 To keep my face warm

 ALICE
 Oh pardon me my mistake

 A locomotive whistle is heard at a distance ALICE listens
 eagerly As the whistle dies away and is not repeated her face
 shows her disappointment

 HATCH
 What was that Theres no trains this time of night

 ALICE
 speaking partly to herself
 It was a freight train going the other way

 HATCH
 suspiciously
 The other way The other way from where

 ALICE
 From where it started Do you know Ive always wanted to meet a
 burglar But its so difficult They go out so seldom

 HATCH
 Yes and they arrive so late

 ALICE
 laughingly
 Now thats much better Its so nice of you to have a sense of
 humor While youre there just close those blinds please so
 that the neighbors cant see what scandalous hours we keep And
 then you can make a light This is much too gloomy for a supper
 party

 HATCH
 closing shutters
 Yes if those were shut it might be safer

 He closes shutters and turns on the two electric lights REDDY
 and HARRY enter carrying plates

 HARRY
 We arent regular waiters miss but we think were pretty good for
 amateurs

 REDDY
 We havent forgot nothing Not even napkins Have some napkins

 Places a pile of folded napkins in front of ALICE Then sits at
 head of table HARRY to lower right of table ALICE moves her
 chair away from the table but keeping REDDY on her right HATCH
 sits still further away from the table on her left

 ALICE
 Thanks Put the plates down there And may I help you to some

 REDDY
 taking food in fingers
 Oh well help ourselves

 ALICE
 Of course youre accustomed to helping yourselves arent you
 To HATCH
 Wont you join them

 HATCH
 No

 Through the scene which follows REDDY and HARRY continue to eat
 and drink heartily

 ALICE
 No Well then while theyre having supper you and I will talk
 If youre going to gag me soon I want to talk while I can
 Rises and hands box to him
 Have a cigar

 HATCH
 takes cigar
 Thanks

 ALICE
 standing with hand on back of chair
 Now I want to ask you some questions You are an intelligent man
 Of course you must be or you couldnt have kept out of jail for
 twenty years To get on in your business a man must be
 intelligent and he must have nerve and courage Nowwith those
 qualities why may I askwhy are you so stupid as to be a
 burglar

 HARRY
 Stupid

 REDDY
 Well I like that

 HATCH
 Stupid Why I make a living at it

 ALICE
 How much of a living

 HATCH
 Ten thousand a year

 ALICE
 Ten thousandwell suppose you made FIFTY thousand What good is
 even a hundred thousand for ONE year if to get it you risk
 going to prison for twenty years Thats not sensible Merely as
 a business proposition to take the risk you do for ten thousand
 dollars is stupid isnt it I can understand a mans risking
 twenty years of his life for some thingsa man like Peary or
 Dewey or SantosDumont They took big risks for big prizes But
 theres thousands of men in this country not half as clever as you
 are earning ten thousand a yearwithout any risk of going to
 jail None of THEM is afraid to go out in public with his wife and
 children THEYRE not afraid to ask a policeman what time it is
 They dont have to wear black masks nor ruin their beautiful
 complexions with burnt cork

 REDDY
 Ah go on Whod give ME a job

 ALICE
 Whom did you ever ask for one

 REDDY
 to HARRY
 Pass me some more of that pie like mother used to make

 HATCH
 Yes there are clerks and shopkeepers working behind a counter
 twentyfour hours a day but they dont make ten thousand a year
 and no one ever hears of THEM Theres no FAME in their job

 ALICE
 Fame Oh how interesting Are youa celebrity

 HATCH
 Im quite as well known as I care to be Now tomorrow all the
 papers will be talking about this Therell be columns about us
 three No one will know we are the ones theyre talking about

 REDDY
 I hope not

 HATCH
 But the men in our profession will know And theyll say That
 was a neat job of Soandsos last night Thats fame Why
 weve got a reputation from one end of this country to the other

 HARRY
 Thats right Theres some of us just as well known asMister
 SantosDumont

 REDDY
 And we fly just as high too

 ALICE
 to HATCH

 REDDY

 ALICE
 Billy the kid really He sounds SO attractive But Im afraidI

 Bank robber

 Farrell Billy Porter

 ALICE

 profession and you have named five men who are at the top of it
 and Ive never heard of one of them And I read the papers too

 REDDY
 Well theres OTHER ladies who have heard of us Real ladies
 When I was doing my last bit in jail I got a thousand letters from
 ladies asking for me photograph and offering to marry me

 ALICE
 Really Well that only proves that menAS HUSBANDSare more
 desirable in jail than out
 To HATCH
 No its a poor life

 HATCH
 Its a poor life you people lead with us to worry you Theres
 seventy millions of you in the United States and only a few of us
 and yet we keep you guessing all the year round Why were the
 last thing you think of at night when you lock the doors were the
 first thing you think of in the morning when you feel for the
 silver basket Were just a few up against seventy millions I
 tell you theres fame and big money and a free life in my business

 ALICE
 Yes its a free life until you go to jail Its this way Youre
 barbarians and theres no place for you in a civilized community
 except in jail Everybody is working against you Every city has
 its police force almost every house nowadays has a private
 watchman And if we want to raise a hue and cry after you there
 are the newspapers and the telegraph and the telephone
 nods at telephone
 and the cables all over the

 HATCH
 Grimly
 Thank you One moment please
 Throws open overcoat showing that it is lined with burglars
 jimmies chisels and augers

 ALICE

 the coat for an automobile trip

 HATCH
 Harry cut those telephone wires
 Hands barbedwire cutter to HARRY To ALICE

 ALICE
 Oh not at all Youve nothing to thank me for
 HARRY goes to telephone To HARRY

 HATCH

 ALICE

 Listens apprehensively

 HATCH
 Sorry I had to bust up your still alarm but after we go we cant
 have you chatting with the police If you hadnt so kindly given
 me a tip about the telephone I might have gone off and clean

 HARRY takes curtain cords from window curtains

 REDDY

 HARRY places muffler on table exposing jewelry

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
