TO MY TEN BEST FRIENDS

Who are far wiser in their way and far better in every way than I and
yet who have not the wisdom to know it

Who do not merely think I am perfect but who are calmly and
permanently convinced of my perfectionand this in spite of fifty
disillusions a day

Who are frantically happy at my coming and bitterly woebegone in my
absence

Who never bore me and never are bored by me

Who never talk about themselves and who always listen with rapturous
interest to anything I may say

Who having no conventional standards have no respectability and who
having no conventional consciences have no sins

Who teach me finer lessons in loyalty in patience in true courtesy
in unselfishness in divine forgiveness in pluck and in abiding good
spirits than do all the books I have ever read and all the other models
I have studied

Who have not deigned to waste time and eyesight in reading a word of
mine and who will not bother to read this verbose tribute to themselves

In short to the most gloriously satisfactory chums who ever appealed
to human vanity and to human desire for companionship

TO OUR TEN SUNNYBANK COLLIES MY STORY IS GRATEFULLY AND AFFECTIONATELY
DEDICATED

CHAPTER I The Coming Of Bruce

She was beautiful And she had a heart and a soulwhich were a curse
For without such a heart and soul she might have found the tough
lifebattle less bitterly hard to fight

But the world does queer thingsdamnable thingsto hearts that are so
tenderly allloving and to souls that are so trustfully and forgivingly
friendly as hers

Her pedigree name was Rothsay Lass She was a colliedaintily
fragile of build sensitive of nostril furrily tawny of coat Her
ancestry was as flawless as any in Burkes Peerage

If God had sent her into the world with a pair of tulip ears and with a
shade less width of brainspace she might have been cherished and
coddled as a potential benchshow winner and in time might even have
won immortality by the title of CHAMPION Rothsay Lass

But her ears pricked rebelliously upward like those of her earliest
ancestors the wolves Nor could manipulation lure their stiff
cartilages into drooping as benchshow fashion demands The average
showcollies ears have a tendency to prick By weights and plasters
and often by torture this tendency is overcome But never when the
cartilage is as unyielding as was Lasss

Her graceful head harked back in shape to the days when collies had to
do much independent thinking as sheepguards and when they needed
more brainroom than is afforded by the borzoi skull sought after by
modern benchshow experts

Wherefore Lass had no hope whatever of winning laurels in the
showring or of attracting a high price from some rich fancier She was
tabulated from babyhood as a secondin other words as a faulty
specimen in a litter that should have been faultless

These seconds are as good to look at from a laymans view as is any
international champion And their offspring are sometimes as perfect as
are those of the finest specimens But lacking the arbitrary points
demanded by showjudges the seconds are condemned to obscurity and
to sell as pets

If Lass had been a male dog her beauty and sense and lovableness would
have found a ready purchaser for her For nine pet collies out of ten
are seconds and splendid pets they make for the most part

But Lass at the very start had committed the unforgivable sin of
being born a female Therefore no petseeker wanted to buy her Even
when she was offered for sale at half the sum asked for her less
handsome brothers no one wanted her

A mareor the female of nearly any species except the caninebrings
as high and as ready a price as does the male But never the female
dog Except for breeding she is not wanted

This prejudice had its start in Crusader days some thousand years ago
Up to that time all through the civilized world a female dog had been
more popular as a pet than a male The Mohammedans to whom by creed
all dogs are unclean gave their European foes the first hint that a
female dog was the lowest thing on earth

The Saracens despised her as the potential mother of future dogs And
they loathed her accordingly Back to Europe came the Crusaders
bearing only three lasting memorials of their contact with the Moslems
One of the three was a sneering contempt for all female dogs

There is no other pet as loving as quick of wit as loyal as
staunchly brave and as companionable as the female collie She has all
the males best traits and none of his worst She has more in common
too with the highest type of woman than has any other animal alive
This with all due respect to womanhood

Prejudice has robbed countless doglovers of the joy of owning such a
pal In England the female pet dog has at last begun to come into her
own Here she has not The loss is ours

And so back to Lass

When wouldbe purchasers were conducted to the puppyrun at the Rothsay
kennels Lass and her six brethren and sisters were wont to come
galloping to the gate to welcome the strangers For the pups were only
three months oldan age when every event is thrillingly interesting
and everybody is a friend Three times out of five the buyers eye
would single Lass from the rollicking and fluffy mass of puppyhood

She was so pretty so wistfully appealing so free from fear and from
bumptiousness as well and carried herself so daintily that ones
heart warmed to her The visitor would point her out The kennelman
would reply flatteringly

Yes she sure is one fine pup

The purchaser never waited to hear the end of the sentence before
turning to some other puppy The pronoun she had killed forever his
dawning fancy for the little beauty

The four males of the litter were soon sold for there is a brisk and a
steady market for good collie pups One of the two other females died
Lasss remaining sister began to shape up with showpossibilities
and was bought by the owner of another kennel Thus by the time she
was five months old Lass was left alone in the puppyrun

She mourned her playmates It was cold at night with no other cuddly
little furball to snuggle down to It was stupid with no one to help
her work off her fivemonths spirits in a romp And Lass missed the
dozens of visitors that of old had come to the run

The kennelmen felt not the slightest interest in her Lass meant
nothing to them except the work of feeding her and of keeping an extra
run in order She was a liability a nuisance

Lass used to watch with pitiful eagerness for the attendants
dutyvisits to the run She would gallop joyously up to them begging
for a word or a caress trying to tempt them into a romp bringing them
peaceofferings in the shape of treasured bones she had buried for her
own future use But all this gained her nothing

A careless word at besta grunt or a shove at worst were her only
rewards For the most part the men with the feedtrough or the
waterpail ignored her bounding and wrigglingly eager welcome as
completely as though she were a part of the kennel furnishings Her
short daily exercise scamper in the open was her nearest approach to
a good time

Then came a day when again a visitor stopped in front of Lasss run He
was not much of a visitor being a pallid and rather shabbily dressed
lad of twelve with a brandnew chain and collar in his hand

You see he was confiding to the bored kennelman who had been
detailed by the foreman to take him around the kennels when I got the
check from Uncle Dick this morning I made up my mind first thing to
buy a dog with it even if it took every cent But then I got to
thinking Id need something to fasten him with so he wouldnt run away
before he learned to like me and want to stay with me So when I got
the check cashed at the store I got this collar and chain

Are you a friend of the boss asked the kennelman

The boss echoed the boy You mean the man who owns this place No
sir But when Ive walked past on the road Ive seen his Collies for
Sale sign lots of times Once I saw some of them being exercised
They were the wonderfulest dogs I ever saw So the minute I got the
money for the check I came here I told the man in the front yard I
wanted to buy a dog Hes the one who turned me over to you I
wishOH he broke off in rapture coming to a halt in front of Lasss
run Look Isnt he a dandy

Lass had trotted hospitably forward to greet the guest Now she was
standing on her hind legs her front paws alternately supporting her
fragile weight on the wire of the fence and waving welcomingly toward
the boy Unknowingly she was bidding for a master And her wistful
friendliness struck a note of response in the little fellows heart
For he too was lonesome much of the time as is the fate of a sickly
only child in an overbusy home And he had the true craving of the
lonely for dog comradeship

He thrust his nonetooclean hand through the wire mesh and patted the
puppys silky head Lass wiggled ecstatically under the unfamiliar
caress All at once in the boys eyes she became quite the most
wonderful animal and the very most desirable pet on earth

Hes great sighed the youngster in admiration adding naively Is
he Champion Rothsay Chiefthe one whose picture was in The Bulletin
last Sunday

The kennelman laughed noisily Then he checked his mirth for
professional reasons as he remembered the nature of the boys quest
and foresaw a bare possibility of getting rid of the unwelcome Lass

Nope he said This isnt Chief If it was I guess your Uncle
Dicks check would have to have four figures in it before you could
make a deal But this is one of Chiefs daughters This is Rothsay
Lass A grand little girl aint she Sayin a confidential
whispersince youve took a fancy for her maybe I could coax the
old man into lettin you have her at an easy price He was plannin to
sell her for a hundred or so But he goes pretty much by what I say He
might let her go forHow much of a check did you say your uncle sent
you

Twelve dollars answered the boyone for each year Because Im
named for him Its my birthday you know Butbut a dollar of it went
for the chain and the collar How much do you suppose the gentleman
would want for Rothsay Lass

The kennelman considered for a moment Then he went back to the house
leaving the lad alone at the gate of the run Eleven dollars for a
highpedigreed collie pup was a joke price But no one else wanted
Lass and her feed was costing more every day According to Rothsay
standards the list of broodfemales was already complete Even as a
gift the kennels would be making money by getting rid of the
prickeared second Wherefore he went to consult with the foreman

Left alone with Lass the boy opened the gate and went into the run A
little to his surprise Lass neither shrank from him nor attacked him
She danced about his legs in delight varying this by jumping up and
trying to lick his excited face Then she thrust her cold nose into the
cup of his hand as a plea to be petted

When the kennelman came back the boy was sitting on the dusty ground
of the run and Lass was curled up rapturously in his lap learning how
to shake hands at his order

You can have her the boss says vouchsafed the kennelman Wheres
the eleven dollars

By this graceless speech Dick Hazen received the key to the Seventh
Paradise and a lifemembership in the worldwide Order of DogLovers

The homeward walk for Lass and her new master was no walk at all but
a form of spiritual levitation The halfmile pilgrimage consumed a
full hour of time Not that Lass hung back or rebelled at her first
taste of collar and chain These petty annoyances went unfelt in the
wild joy of a real walk and in the infinitely deeper happiness of
knowing her friendshipfamine was appeased at last

The walk was long for various reasonspartly because in her frisking
gyrations Lass was forever tangling the new chain around Dicks thin
ankles partly because he stopped every block or so to pat her or to
give her further lessons in the art of shaking hands Also there were
admiring boyacquaintances along the way to whom the wonderful pet
must be exhibited

At last Dick turned in at the gate of a cheap bungalow on a cheap
streeta bungalow with a discouraged geranium plot in its
pockethandkerchief front yard and with a double line of drying
clothes in the no larger space behind the house

As Dick and his chum rounded the house a woman emerged from between
the two lines of flapping sheets whose hanging she had been
superintending She stopped at sight of her son and the dog

Oh she commented with no enthusiasm at all Well you did it hey
I was hoping youd have better sense and spend your check on a nice
new suit or something Hes kind of pretty though she went on the
puppys friendliness and beauty wringing the word of grudging praise
from her What kind of a dog is he And youre sure he isnt savage
arent you

Collie answered Dick proudly Pedigreed collie You bet she isnt
savage either Why shes an angel She minds me already Seeshake
hands Lass Lass ejaculated Mrs Hazen SHE Dick you dont
mean to tell me youve gone and bought yourself aa FEMALE dog

The woman spoke in the tone of horrified contempt that might well have
been hers had she found a rattlesnake and a brace of toads in her sons
pocket And she lowered her voice as is the manner of her kind when
forced to speak of the unspeakable She moved back from the puppys
politely outthrust forepaw as from the passing of a garbage cart

A female dog she reiterated Well of all the chuckleheads A
nasty FEMALE dog with your birthday money

Shes not one bit nasty flamed Dick burying the grubby fingers of
his right hand protectively in the fluffy mass of the puppys
halfgrown ruff Shes the dandiest dog ever She

Dont talk back to me snapped Mrs Hazen Here Turn right around
and take her to the cheats who sold her to you Tell them to keep her
and give you the good money you paid for her Take her out of my yard
this minute Quick

A hot mist of tears sprang into the boys eyes Lass with the queer
intuition that tells a female collie when her master is unhappy whined
softly and licked his clenched hand

Iaw PLEASE Ma he begged chokingly PLEASE Itsits my
birthday and everything Please let me keep her II love her better
than most anything there is Cant I please keep her Please

You heard what I said returned his mother curtly

The washerwoman who one day a week lightened Mrs Hazens household
labors waddled into view from behind the billows of windswirled
clothes She was an excellent person and was built for endurance
rather than for speed At sight of Lass she paused in real interest

My she exclaimed with flattering approval So you got your dog did
you You didnt waste no time And hes sure a handsome little critter
Whatcher goin to call him

Its not a him Irene contradicted Mrs Hazen with another modest
lowering of her strong voice Its a HER And Im sending Dick back
with her to where she came from Ive got my opinion of people who
will take advantage of a childs ignorance by palming off a horrid
female dog on him too Take her away Dick I wont have her here
another minute You hear me

Please Ma stammered Dick battling with his desire to cry Aw
PLEASE II

Your mas right Dick chimed in the washerwoman her first
interested glance at the puppy changing to one of refined and lofty
scorn Take her back You dont want any female dogs around No nice
folks do

Why not demanded the boy in sudden hopeless anger as he pressed
lovingly the nose Lass thrust so comfortingly into his hand WHY dont
we want a female dog around Folks have female cats around them and
female women Why isnt a female dog

That will do Dick broke in his shocked mother Take her away

I wont said the boy speaking very slowly and with no excitement
at all

A slap on the side of his head from his mothers punitive palm made
him stagger a little Her hand was upraised for a second installment of
rebellionquellingwhen a slender little body flashed through the air
and landed heavily against her chest A set of white puppyteeth all
but grazed her wrathful red face

Lass who never before had known the impulse to attack had jumped to
the rescue of the beaten youngster whom she had adopted as her god The
woman screeched in terror Dick flung an arm about the furry whirlwind
that was seeking to avenge his punishment and pulled the dog back to
his side

Mrs Hazens shriek and the obbligato accompaniment of the
washerwoman made an approaching man quicken his steps as he strolled
around the side of the house The newcomer was Dicks father
superintendent of the local bottling works On his way home to lunch
he walked in on a scene of hysteria

Kill her sir bawled the washerwoman at sight of him Kill her
Shes a mad dog She just tried to kill Miz Hazen

She didnt do anything of the kind wailed Dick She was pertecting
me Ma hit me and Lass

Ed tearily proclaimed Mrs Hazen if you dont send for a policeman
to shoot that filthy beast Ill

Hold on interrupted the man at a loss to catch the drift of these
appeals by reason of their all being spoken in a succession so rapid
as to make a single blurred sentence Hold on Whats wrong And where
did the pup come from Hes a looker all right a cute little cuss
Whats the row

With the plangently useless iterations of a Greek chorus the tale was
flung at him piecemeal and in chunks and in a triple key When
presently he understood Hazen looked down for a moment at the
puppywhich was making sundry advances of a shy but friendly nature
toward him Then he looked at the boy and noted Dicks heroeffort to
choke back the onrush of babyish sobs And then with a roughly
tolerant gesture he silenced the two raucous women who were beginning
the tale over again for the third time

I see he said I see I see how it is Neednt din it at me any
more folks And I see Dickys side of it too Yes and I see the
pups side of it I know a lot about dogs That pup isnt vicious She
knows she belongs to Dick You lammed into him and she took up and
defended him Thats all there is to the maddog part of it

But Ed sputtered his wife

Now you let ME do the talking Sade he insisted halfgrinning yet
more than half grimly Im the boss here If Im not then its safe
to listen to me till the boss gets here And were goin to do whatever
I say we arewithout any backtalk or sulks either Its this way
Your brother gave the boy a birthday check We promised he could spend
it any way he had a mind to He said he wanted a dog didnt he And I
said Go to it didnt I Well he got the dog Just because it
happens to be a she thats no reason why he oughtnt to be allowed to
keep it And he can That goes

Oh Dad squealed Dick in grateful heroworship Youre a brick Im
not ever going to forget this so long as I live Say watch her shake
hands Dad Ive taught her already to

Ed Hazen loudly protested his wife Of all the softies You havent
backbone enough for a prune And if my orders to my own son are going
to be

Thatll be all Sade interposed the man stifflyadding By the
way I got a queer piece of news to tell you Come into the kitchen a
minute

Grumbling rebellious scowlingyet unable to resist the lure of a
queer piece of news Mrs Hazen followed her husband indoors leaving
Dick and his pet to gambol deliriously around the clothesfestooned
yard in celebration of their victory

Listen here old girl began Hazen the moment the kitchen door was
shut behind them Use some sense cant you I gave you the wink and
you wouldnt catch on So I had to make the grandstand play Im no
more stuck on having a measly shedog around here than you are And
were not going to have her either But

Then why did you say you were going to Why did you make a fool of me
before Irene and everything she demanded wrathful yet bewildered

Its the boys birthday isnt it urged Hazen And Id promised
him hadnt I And last time he had one of those turns didnt Doc
Colfax say we mustnt let him fret and worry any moren we could help
Well if he had to take that dog back today itd have broke his
heart Hed have felt like we were his enemies and hed never have
felt the same to us again And it might have hurt his health toothe
shock and all So

But I tell you she persisted I wont have a dirty little female

We arent going to he assured her Keep your hair on till Ive
finished Tonight after Dicks asleep Im going to get rid of her
Hell wake up in the morning and find shes gone and the doorll be
open Hell think shes run away Hell go looking for her and hell
keep on hoping to find her So thatll ease the shock you see by
letting him down bit by bit instead of snatching his pet away from him
violentlike And he wont hold it up against US either as he would
the other way I can offer a reward for her too

There was a long and thoughtcrammed pause The woman plunged deep into
the silences as her fat brain wrought over the suggestion Then

Maybe you HAVE got just a few grains of sense after all Ed
grudgingly vouchsafed Mrs Hazen It isnt a bad idea Only hell
grieve a lot for her

Hell be hoping though said her husband Hell be hoping all the
while That always takes the razoredge off of grieving Leave it to
me

That was the happiest day Dick Hazen had ever known And it was the
first actively happy day in all Lasss five months of life

Boy and dog spent hours in a ramble through the woods They began
Lasss educationwhich was planned to include more intricate tricks
than a performing elephant and a troupe of circus dogs could hope to
learn in a lifetime They became sworn chums Dick talked to Lass as if
she were human She amazed the enraptured boy by her cleverness and
spirits His initiation to the dogmasters guild was joyous and
complete

It was a tired and ravenous pair of friends who scampered home at
dinnertime that evening The pallor was gone from Dicks face His
cheeks were glowing and his eyes shone He ate greedily His parents
looked covertly at each other And the selfcomplacency lines around
Hazens mouth blurred

Boy and dog went to bed early being blissfully sleepy and full of
foodalso because another and longer woodland ramble was scheduled for
the morrow

Timidly Dick asked leave to have Lass sleep on the foot of his cotbed
After a second telegraphing of glances his parents consented Half an
hour later the playmates were sound asleep the puppy snuggling deep in
the hollow of her masters arm her furry head across his thin chest

It was in this pose that Hazen found them when late in the evening he
tiptoed into Dicks cubbyhole room He gazed down at the slumberous
pair for a space while he fought and conquered an impulse toward fair
play Then he stooped to pick up the dog

Lass waking at the slight creak of a floorboard lifted her head At
sight of the figure leaning above her adored master the lip curled
back from her white teeth Far down in her throat a growl was born
Then she recognized the intruder as the man who had petted her and fed
her that evening The growl died in her throat giving place to a
welcoming thump or two of her bushy tail Dick stirred uneasily

Patting the puppy lightly on her upraised head Hazen picked up Lass in
his arms and tiptoed out of the room with her Mistaking this move for
a form of caress she tried to lick his face The man winced

Downstairs and out into the street Hazen bore his trustful little
burden halting only to put on his hat and for a whispered word with
his wife For nearly a mile he carried the dog Lass greatly enjoyed
the ride She was pleasantly tired and it was nice to be carried thus
by some one who was so considerate as to save her the bother of walking

At the edge of the town Hazen set her on the ground and at once began
to walk rapidly away in the direction of home He had gone perhaps
fifty yards when Lass was gamboling merrily around his feet A kick
sent the dismayed and agonized puppy flying through the air like a
whimpering catapult and landed her against a bank with every atom of
breath knocked out of her Before she had fairly struck groundbefore
she could look about herHazen had doubled around a corner and had
vanished

At a run he made for home glad the unpleasant job was over At the
door his wife met him

Well she demanded did you drown her in the canal the way you
said

No he confessed sheepishly I didnt exactly drown her You see
she nestled down into my arms so cozy and trustinglike that Iwell
I fixed it so shell never show up around here again Trust me to do a
job thoroughly if I do it at all I

A dramatic gesture from Mrs Hazens stubby forefinger interrupted him
He followed the fingers angry point Close at his side stood Lass
wagging her tail and staring expectantly up at him

With her keen power of scent it had been no exploit at all to track
the man over a mile of unfamiliar ground Already she had forgiven the
kick or had put it down to accident on his part And at the end of her
eager chase she was eager for a word of greeting

Ill be gurgled Hazen blinking stupidly

I guess you will be conceded his wife If thats the thorough way
you do your jobs at the factory

Say he mumbled in a sort of wondering appeal is there any HUMAN
that would like to trust a feller so much as to risk another
ribcracking kick just for the sake of being where he is I almost
wish

But the wish was unspoken Hazen was a true American husband He feared
his wife more than he loved fairness And his wifes glare was full
upon him With a grunt he picked Lass up by the neck tucked her under
his arm and made off through the dark

He did not take the road toward the canal however Instead he made for
the railroad tracks He remembered how as a lad he had once gotten
rid of a mangy cat and he resolved to repeat the exploit It was far
more merciful to the puppyor at least to Hazens consciencethan
to pitch Lass into the slimy canal with a stone tied to her neck

A line of freight carsemptieswas on a siding a short distance
above the station Hazen walked along the track trying the door of
each car he passed The fourth he came to was unlocked He slid back
the newly greased side door thrust Lass into the chilly and black
interior and quickly slid shut the door behind her Then with the silly
feeling of having committed a crime he stumbled away through the
darkness at top speed

A freight car has a myriad uses beyond the carrying of legitimate
freight From time immemorial it has been a favorite repository for
all manner of illicit flotsam and jetsam human or otherwise

Its popularity with tramps and similar derelicts has long been a theme
for comic paper and vaudeville jest Though heaven knows the inside
of a moving boxcar has few jocose features except in the imagination
of humorous artist or vaudevillian

But a far more frequent use for such cars has escaped the notice of the
public at large As any old railroader can testify trainhands are
forever finding in boxcars every genus and species of stray

These finds range all the way from cats and dogs and discarded white
rabbits and canaries to goats Dozens of babies have been discovered
wailing and deserted in boxcar recesses perhaps a hundred miles from
the siding where furtively the tiny human bundle was thrust inside
some conveniently unlatched side door

A freight train offers glittering chances for the disposal of the
Unwanted More than once a slain man or woman has been sent along the
line in this grisly but effective fashion far beyond the reach of
recognition

Hazen had done nothing original or new in depositing the luckless
collie pup in one of these wheeled receptacles He was but following an
oldestablished custom familiar to many in his line of life There was
no novelty to itexcept to Lass

The car was dark and cold and smelly Lass hated it She ran to its
door Here she found a gleam of hope for escape and for return to the
home where every one that day had been so kind to her Hazen had shut
the door with such vehemence that it had rebounded The hasp was down
and so the catch had not done its duty The door had slid open a few
inches from the impetus of Hazens shove

It was not wide enough open to let Lass jump out but it was wide
enough for her to push her nose through And by vigorous thrusting
with her triangular head as a wedge she was able to widen the
aperture inch by inch In less than three minutes she had broadened it
far enough for her to wriggle out of the car and leap to the side of
the track There she stood bewildered

A spring snow was drifting down from the sulky sky The air was damp
and penetrating By reason of the new snow the scent of Hazens
departing footsteps was blotted out Hazen himself was no longer in
sight As Lass had made the journey from house to tracks with her head
tucked confidingly under her kidnapers arm she had not noted the
direction She was lost

A little way down the track the station lights were shining with misty
warmth through the snow Toward these lights the puppy trotted

Under the station eaves and waiting to be taken aboard the almostdue
elevenforty express several crates and parcels were grouped One
crate was the scene of much the same sort of escapedrama that Lass had
just enacted

The crate was big and comfortable bedded down with soft sacking and
with insets at either side containing food and water But commodious
as was the box the unwonted confinement did not at all please its
occupanta temperamental and highly bred young collie in process of
shipment from the Rothsay Kennels to a purchaser forty miles up the
line

This collie wearying of the delay and the loneliness and the strange
quarters had begun to plunge from one side of the crate to the other
in an effort to break out A carelessly nailed slat gave away under the
impact The dog scrambled through the gap and proceeded to gallop
homeward through the snow

Ten seconds later Lass drawn by the lights and by the scent of the
other dog came to the crate She looked in There made to order for
her was a nice bed There too were food and drink to appease the
everpresent appetite of a puppy Lass writhed her way in through the
gap as easily as the former occupant had crawled out

After doing due justice to the broken puppy biscuits in the
insettrough she curled herself up for a nap

The clangor and glare of the oncoming express awakened her She cowered
in one corner of the crate Just then two stationhands began to move
the express packages out to the edge of the platform One of them
noticed the displaced board of the crate He drove home its loosened
nails with two sharp taps from a monkeywrench glanced inside to make
certain the dog had not gotten out and presently hoisted the crate
aboard the expresscar

Two hours later the crate was unloaded at a waystation At seven in the
morning an expressman drove two miles with it to a countryhome a mile
or so from the village where Lass had been disembarked from the train

An eager knot of peoplethe Mistress the Master and two
gardenerscrowded expectantly around the crate as it was set down on
the lawn in front of The Places veranda The latch was unfastened and
the crates top was lifted back on its hinges

Out stepped Lasstired confused a little frightened but eagerly
willing to make friends with a world which she still insisted on
believing was friendly It is hard to shake a collie pups inborn faith
in the friendliness of mankind but once shaken it is more than
shaken It is shattered beyond hope of complete mending

For an instant she stood thus looking in timid appeal from one to
another of the faces about her These faces were blank enough as they
returned her gaze The glad expectancy was wiped from them as with a
sponge It was the Master who first found voice

And THATS Rothsay Princess he snorted indignantly Thats the pup
worth two hundred dollars at eight months because she has every
single good point of Champion Rothsay Chief and not a flaw from nostril
to tailtip Rothsay wrote those very words about her you remember
And hes supposed to be the most dependable man in the collie business
Lord Shes undersizedno bigger than a five monther And shes
prickeared and appledomed and her heads as wide as a church door

Apparently these humans were not glad to see her Lass was grieved at
their cold appraisal and a little frightened by the Masters tone of
disgust Yet she was eager as ever to make a good impression and to
lure people into liking her Shyly she walked up to the Mistress and
laid one white little paw on her knee

Handshaking was Lasss one accomplishment It had been taught her by
Dick It had pleased the boy He had been proud of her ability to do
it Perhaps it might also please these strangers And after the odd
fashion of all new arrivals who came to The Place Lass picked out the
Mistress rather than any one else as a potential friend

The Mistress had ever roused the impatience of collie experts by
looking past the showier points of a dog and into the soul and brain
and disposition that lay behind them So now she looked and what she
saw in Lasss darkly wistful eyes established the intruders status at
The Place

Let her stay pleaded the Mistress as the Master growled something
about bundling the dog into her crate again and sending her back to the
Rothsay Kennels Let her stay please Shes a dear

But were not breeding dears observed the Master We planned to
breed a strain of perfect collies And this is a mutt

Her pedigree says theres no better collie blood in America denied
the Mistress And even if she happens to be a second thats no sign
her puppies will be seconds See how pretty and loving and wise she is
DO keep her

Which of course settled the matter

Up the lawn from his morning swim in the lake strolled a great
mahoganyandwhite collie At sight of Lass he lowered his head for a
charge He was king of The Places dogs this mighty thoroughbred
Sunnybank Lad And he did not welcome canine intruders

But he halted midway in his dash toward the puppy who frisked forth so
gayly to meet him For he recognized her as a female And man is the
only animal that will molest the female of his species

The fiercely silent charge was changed in a trice to a coldly civil
touching of noses and the majestic wagging of a plumy tail After
which side by side the two colliesbig and littleold and
newwalked up to the veranda to be petted by the humans who had so
amusedly watched their encounter

See exclaimed the Mistress in triumph Lad has accepted her He
vouches for her That ought to be enough for any one

Thus it was that Lass found a home

As she never yet had been taught to know her name she learned readily
to respond to the title of Princess And for several months life went
on evenly and happily for her

Indeed life was always wondrous pleasant there at The Placefor
humans and for animals alike A fireblue lake bordered the grounds on
two sides Behind stretched the forest And on every side arose the
soft green mountains hemming in and brooding over The Place as though
they loved it In the winter evenings there was the huge library hearth
with its blaze and warmth and a disreputable fur rug in front of it
that might have been ordained expressly for tired dogs to drowse on
And there were the Mistress and the Master Especially the Mistress
The Mistress somehow had a way of making all the world seem worth while

Then of a morning when Lass was just eleven months old two things
happened

The Mistress and the Master went down to her kennel after breakfast
Lass did not run forth to greet them as usual She lay still wagging
her tail in feeble welcome as they drew near But she did not get up

Crowding close to her tawny side was a tiny shapeless creature that
looked more like a fat blind rat than like anything else It was a
tenhourold collie pupa male and yellowish brown of hue

Thats the climax complained the Master breaking in on the
Mistresss rhapsodies Here weve been planning to start a kennel of
homebred collies And see what results we get One solitary puppy Not
once in ten times are there less than six in a collielitter Sometimes
there are a dozen And here the dog you wheedled me into keeping has
just one I expected at least seven

If its a freak to be the only puppy in a litter answered the
Mistress refusing to part with her enthusiasm over the miracle then
this one ought to bring us luck Lets call him Bruce You remember
the original Bruce won because of the mystic number seven This Bruce
has got to make up to us for the seven puppies that werent born See
how proud she is of him Isnt she a sweet little mother

The second of the mornings events was a visit from the foreman of the
Rothsay Kennels who motored across to The Place intent on clearing up
a mystery

The Boss found a collie yesterday tied in the front yard of a negro
cabin a mile or two from our kennels he told the Master He
recognized her right away as Rothsay Princess The negro claims to have
found her wandering around near the railroad tracks one night six
months ago Now whats the answer

The answer said the Master is that your boss is mistaken Ive had
Rothsay Princess for the past six months And shes the last dog Ill
ever get from the Rothsay Kennels I was stung good and plenty on
that deal

My wife wanted to keep her or Id have made a kick in the courts for
having to pay two hundred dollars for a cheeky appledomed prick
eared

Prickeared exclaimed the foreman aghast at the volleyed sacrilege
Rothsay Princess has the best ears of any pup weve bred since
Champion Rothsay Chief Not a flaw in that pup She

Not a flaw hey sniffed the Master Come down to the kennel and
take a look at her She has as many flaws as a streetcur has fleas

He led the way to the kennel At sight of the stranger Lass growled and
showed her teeth For a collie mother will let nobody but proven
friends come near to her newborn brood

The foreman stared at the hostile young mother for a halfminute
whistling bewilderedly between his teeth Then he laughed aloud

Thats no more Rothsay Princess than I am he declared I know who
she IS though Id remember that funny mask among a million Thats
Rothsay Lass Though how she got HERE

We couldnt have shipped her by mistake either he went on
confused For wed sold her that same day to a kid in our town I
ought to know Because the kid kept on pestering us every day for a
month afterward to find if she had come back to us He said she ran
away in the night He still comes around once a week or so to ask A
spindly weak sicklooking little chap he is I dont get the point
of this thing from any angle But we run our kennels on the square
And I can promise the bossll either send back your check or send
Rothsay Princess to you and take Lass back

Two days later while all The Place was still mulling over the mystery
a letter came for the Master from Lasss home town It was signed
Edwd Hazen and it was written on the cheap stationery of his
employers bottling works It read

Dear Sir

Six months ago my son bought a dog from the Rothsay Kennels It was a
shedog and his ma and I didnt want one around So I put it aboard a
freightcar on the sly My boy went sick over losing his dog He has
never rightly got over it but he peaks and mopes and gets thinner all
the time If I had known how hard he was going to take it I would of
cut off my hand before I would of done such a thing And my wife feels
just like I do about it We would both of us have given a hundred
dollars to get the dog back for him when we saw how bad he felt But
it was too late Somehow or other it is most generally too late when a
rotten thing has been done

Today he went again to the Rothsay Kennels to ask if she had come
back He has always been hoping she would And they told him you have
her Now sir I am a poor man but if one hundred dollars will make
you sell me that dog Ill send it to you in a money order by return
mail It will be worth ten times that much to my wife and me to have
Dick happy again I inclose a stamp Will you let me know

Six weeks afterward The Places car brought Dick Hazen across to
receive his longlost pet

The boy was thinner and shakier and whiter than when he had gone to
sleep with his cherished puppy curled against his narrow chest But
there was a light in his eyes and an eagerness in his heart that had
not been there in many a long week

Lass was on the veranda to welcome him And as Dick scrambled out of
the car and ran to pick her up she came more than halfway to meet
him With a flurry of fastpattering steps and a bark of eager welcome
she flung herself upon her longvanished master For a highbred collie
does not forget And at first glimpse of the boy Lass remembered him

Dick caught her up in his armsa harder feat than of yore because of
her greater weight and his own sapped strengthand hugged her tight
to his breast Winking very fast indeed to disperse tears that had no
place in the eyes of a selfcontained man of twelve he sputtered
rapturously

I KNEW Id find you LassieI knew it all the timeeven the times
when I was deadsure I wouldnt Gee but youve grown though And
youre beautifuler than ever Isnt she Miss he demanded turning to
the Mistress with instinctive knowledge that here at least he would
find confirmation Indeed she is the Mistress assured him

And see how glad she is to be with you again She

And Dad says she can stay with me for keeps exulted Dick He says
hell put a new lock on the cellar door so she cant ever push out
again the way she did last time But I guess shes had her lesson in
going out for walks at night and not being able to find her way back
She and I are going to have the dandiest times together that ever
happened Arent we Lass Is that her little boy he broke off in
eager curiosity as the Master appeared from the kennels carrying
Bruce

The puppy was set down on the veranda floor for Dicks inspection

Hes cunning isnt he Kind of like a Teddy Bearthe sort kids play
with But with a tinge of worry Im not sure Ma will let me keep
two Maybe

Perhaps suggested the Mistress perhaps youd like us to keep
little Bruce to remember Lass by Well try to make him very happy

Yesm agreed Dick in much haste his brow clearing from a mental
vision of Mrs Hazens face when she should see him return with twice
as many dogs as he had set out for Yesm If you wouldnt mind very
much Spose we leave it that way I guess Brucell like being with
you Miss II guess pretty near anybody would Youllyoull try not
to be too homesick for Lass wont you

On the steps of the veranda the downy and fat puppy watched his
mothers departure with no especial interest By the Mistresss wish
Mr Hazen had not been required to make any part of his proffered
hundreddollar payment for the return of his boys pet All the
Mistress had stipulated was that Lass might be allowed to remain at The
Place until baby Bruce should no longer need her

Bruce said the Mistress as the car rolled up the drive and out of
sight you are the sole visible result of The Places experiment in
raising prize collies You have a tremendous responsibility on those
fat little shoulders of yoursto live up to it all

By way of showing his scorn for such trifles as a tremendous
responsibility Bruce proceeded to make a ferocious onslaught at the
Mistresss temperamental gray Persian kitten Tipperary which was
picking a mincing way across the veranda

A howl of pain and two scratches on his tiny nose immediately followed
the attack Tipperary then went on with her mincing promenade And
Bruce with loud lamentations galloped to the shelter of the
Mistresss skirt

Poor little chap soothed the Mistress picking him up and comforting
him Responsibility isnt such a joke after all is it Baby



CHAPTER II The Pest

Thackeray as a lad was dropped from college for laziness and for
gambling Bismarck failed to get a University degree because he lacked
power to study and because he preferred midnight beer to midnight oil
George Washington in student days could never grasp the simplest
rules of spelling The young Lincoln loved to sprawl in the shade with
fishpole or tattered book when he should have been working

Now these men were giantsphysically as well as mentally Being
giants they were by nature slow of development

The kitten at six months of age is graceful and compact and of
perfect poise The lioncub at the same age is a gawky and foolish
and illknit mass of legs and fur deficient in sense and in symmetry
Yet at six years the lion and the cat are not to be compared for power
or beauty or majesty or brain or along any other lines

The foregoing is not an essay on the slow development of the Great It
is merely a condensation of the Mistresss earnest arguments against
the selling or giving away of a certain hopelessly awkward and
senseless and altogether undesirable collie pup named Bruce

From the very first the Mistress had been Bruces champion at The
Place There was no competition for that office She and she alone
could see any promise in the shambling youngster

Because he had been born on The Place and because he was the only son
of Rothsay Lass whom the Mistress had also championed against strong
opposition it had been decided to keep and raise him But daily this
decision seemed less and less worth while Only the Mistresss
championing of the Undesirable prevented his early banishment

From a fuzzy and adventurous fluffball of graygoldandwhite fur
Bruce swiftly developed into a lanky giant He was almost as large
again as is the average collie pup of his age but big as he was his
legs and feet and head were huge out of all proportion to the rest of
him The head did not bother him Being hampered by no weight of brain
it would be navigated with more or less ease in spite of its bulk But
the legs and feet were not only in his own way but in every one elses

He seemed totally lacking in sense as well as in bodily coordination
He was forever getting into needless trouble He was a stormcenter No
one but a born foolcanine or humancould possibly have caused
onetenth as much bother

The Mistress had named him Bruce after the stately Scottish
chieftain who was her historyhero And she still called him
Brucefifty times a dayin the weary hope of teaching him his name
But every one else on The Place gave him a title instead of a namea
title that stuck The Pest He spent twentyfour hours daily living
up to it

Compared with Bruces helplessly clownish troubleseeking propensities
Charlie Chaplins screen exploits are miracles of heroic dignity and of
good luck

There was a little artificial waterlily pool on The Place perhaps
four feet deep By actual count Bruce fell into it no less than nine
times in a single week Once or twice he had nearly drowned there
before some member of the family chanced to fish him out And learning
nothing from experience he would fall in again promptly the next day

The Master at last rigged up a sort of sloping wooden platform running
from the lip of the pool into the water so that Bruce could crawl out
easily next time he should tumble in Bruce watched the placing of
this platform with much grave interest The moment it was completed he
trotted down it on a tour of investigation At its lower edge he
slipped and rolled into the pool There he floundered with no thought
at all of climbing out as he had got in until the Master rescued him
and spread a wire net over the whole pool to avert future accidents

Thenceforth Bruce met with no worse mischance there than the
perpetual catching of his toepads in the meshes of the wire Thus
ensnared he would stand howling most lamentably until his yells
brought rescue

Though the pool could be covered with a net the wide lake at the foot
of the lawn could not be Into the lake Bruce would wade till the water
reached his shoulders Then with a squeal of venturesome joy he would
launch himself outward for a swim and once facing away from shore he
never had sense enough to turn around

After a halfhour of steady swimming his soft young strength would
collapse A howl of terror would apprise the world at large that he was
about to drown Whereat some passing boatman would pick him up and hold
him for ransom or else some one from The Place must jump into skiff or
canoe and hie with all speed to the rescue The same thing would be
repeated day after day

The local SPCA threatened to bring action against the Master for
letting his dog risk death in this way from drowning Morbidly the
Master wished the risk might verge into a certainty

The puppys ravenous appetite was the wonder of all He stopped eating
only when there was nothing edible in reach And as his ideas of edible
food embraced everything that was chewablefrom bathtowels to
axlegreasehe was seldom fasting and was frequently ill

Nature does more for animals than for humans By a single experience
she warns them as a rule what they may safely eat and what they may
not Bruce was the exception He would pounce upon and devour a
luscious bit of laundrysoap with just as much relish as though a
similar bit of soap had not made him horribly sick the day before

Once he munched relishfully a twopound box of starch box and all
on his recovery he began upon a second box and was unhappy when it
was taken from him

He would greet members of the family with falsettothunderous barks of
challenge as they came down the drive from the highway But he would
frisk out in joyous welcome to meet and fawn upon tramps or peddlers
who sought to invade The Place He could scarce learn his own name He
could hardly be taught to obey the simplest command As for shaking
hands or lying down at order those two earliest bits of any dogs
education they meant no more to Bruce than did the theory of
quadratic equations

At three months he launched forth merrily as a chickenkiller
gleefully running down and beheading The Places biggest Orpington
rooster But his first kill was his last The Master saw to that

There is no use in thrashing a dog for killing poultry There is but
one practically sure cure for the habit And this one cure the Master
applied

He tied the slain rooster firmly around Bruces furry throat and made
the puppy wear it as a heavy and increasingly malodorous pendant for
three warm days and nights

Before the end of this seventytwohour period Bruce had grown to
loathe the sight and scent of chicken Stupid as he was he learned
this lesson with absolute thoroughnessas will almost any
chickenkilling pupand it seemed to be the only teaching that his
unawakened young brain had the power to grasp

In looks too Bruce was a failure His yellowishandwhite body was
all but shapeless His coat was thick and heavy enough but it showed a
tendency to curlalmost to kinkinstead of waving crisply as a
collies ought The head was coarse and blurred in line The body was
gaunt in spite of its incessant feedings As for contour or style

It was when the Master in disgust pointed out these diverse failings
of the pup that the Mistress was wont to draw on historic precedent
for other instances of slow development and to take in vain the names
of Thackeray Lincoln Washington and Bismarck and the rest

Give him time she urged once He isnt quite six months old yet
and he has grown so terribly fast Why hes over two feet tall at the
shoulder even nowmuch bigger than most fullgrown collies Champion
Howgill Rival is spoken of as a big dog yet he is only twentyfour
inches at the shoulder Mr Leighton says Surely its something to own
a dog that is so big

It IS something gloomily conceded the Master In our case it is a
catastrophe I dont set up to be an expert judge of collies so maybe
I am all wrong about him Im going to get professional opinion
though Next week they are going to have the spring dogshow at Hampton
Its a little holeinacorner show of course But Symonds is to be
the allaround judge except for the toy breeds And Symonds knows
collies from the ground up I am going to take Bruce over there and
enter him for the puppy class If he is any good Symonds will know it
If the dog is as worthless as I think he is Ill get rid of him If
Symonds gives any hope for him Ill keep him on a while longer

But ventured the Mistress if Symonds says Thumbs down then

Then Ill buy a pet armadillo or an ornithorhynchus instead
threatened the Master Either of them will look more like a collie
than Bruce does

II wonder if Mr Symonds smokes mused the Mistress under her
breath

Smokes echoed the Master Whats that got to do with it

I was only wondering she made hesitant answer if a box of very
wonderful cigars sent to him with our cards mightnt perhaps

Its a fine sportsmanly proposition laughed the Master When women
get to ruling the world of sport therell be no need of comic
cartoons Genuine photographs will do as well If its just the same to
you dear girl well let Symonds buy his own cigars for the present
The dogshow game is almost the only one I know of where a judge is
practically always on the square People doubt his judgment sometimes
but there is practically never any doubt of his honesty Besides we
want to get the exact dope on Bruce Not that I havent got it
already If Symonds gates him Im going to offer him for sale at
the show If nobody buys him there Im going

He hasnt been gated yet answered the Mistress in calm confidence

At the little spring show at Hampton a meager eighty dogs were
exhibited of which only nine were collies This collie division
contained no specimens to startle the dogworld Most of the exhibits
were pets And like nearly all pets they were secondsin other
words the less desirable dogs of thoroughbred litters

Hamptons town hall auditorium was filled to overcrowding with a mass
of visitors who paraded interestedly along the aisles between the
raised rows of stalllike benches where the dogs were tied or who
grouped densely around all four sides of the roped judgingring in the
center of the hall

For a dogshow has a welnigh universal appeal to humanity at large
even as the love for dogs is one of the primal and firmrooted human
emotions Not only the actual exhibitor and their countless friends
flock to such shows but the public at large is drawn thither as to no
other function of the kind

Horseracing it is true brings out a crowd many times larger than
does a dogshow But only because of the thrill of winning or losing
money For where ones spare cash is there is his heart and his
allabsorbing interest Yet it is a matter of record that grass is
growing high on the racetracks in such states as have been able to
enforce the antibetting laws The sport of kings flourishes only
where wagers may accompany it Remove the betting element and you turn
your racetrack into a huge and untrodden lot

There is practically no betting connected with any dogshow People go
there to see the dogs and to watch their judging and for nothing else
As a rule the show is not even a social event Nevertheless the
average dogshow is thronged with spectators Try to cross Madison
Square Garden on Washingtons Birthday afternoon while the
Westminster Kennel Clubs Show is in progress If you can work your way
through the press of visitors in less than half an hour then Nature
intended you for a football champion

The fortunate absence of a bettinginterest alone keeps such affairs
from becoming among the foremost sporting features of the world Many
of the dogs on view are fools of course Because many of them have
been bred solely with a view to showpoints And their owners and
handlers have done nothing to awaken in their exhibits the halfhuman
brain and heart that is a dogs heritage All has been sacrificed to
pointsto points which are arbitrary and which change as freakily as
do fashions in dress

For example a few years ago a financial giant collected and exhibited
one of the finest bunches of collies on earth He had a competent
manager and an army of kennelmen to handle them He took inordinate
pride in these priceless collies of his Once I watched him at the
Garden Show displaying them to some Wall Street friends Three times
he made errors in naming his dogs Once when he leaned too close to
the star collie of his kennels the dog mistook him for a stranger and
resented the intrusion by snapping at him He did not know his own
pets one from another And they did not know their owner by sight or
by scent

At the small shows there is an atmosphere wholly different Few of the
big breeders bother to compete at such contests The dogs are for the
most part pets for which their owners feel a keen personal affection
and which have been brought up as members of their masters households
Thus if small shows seldom bring forth a worldbeating dog they at
least are full of clever and humanized exhibits and of men and women to
whom the success or failure of their canine friends is a matter of
intensest personal moment Wherefore the small show often gives the
beholder something he can find but rarely in a larger exhibition

A few dogs genuinely enjoy showsor are supposed to To many others a
dogshow is a horror

Which windy digression brings us back by prosy degrees to Bruce and to
the Hampton dogshow

The collies were the first breed to be judged And the puppy class as
usual was the first to be called to the ring

There were but three collie pups all males One was a rangy tricolor
of eleven months with a fair head and a bad coat The second was an
exquisite sixmonths puppy rich of coat prematurely perfect of head
and cowhocked These two and Bruce formed the puppy class which paraded
before Symonds in the oblong ring

Anyhow whispered the Mistress as the Master led his stolidly
gigantic entry toward the enclosure Bruce cant get worse than a
thirdprize yellow ribbon We ought to be a little proud of that There
are only three entries in his class

But even that bit of barren pride was denied the awkward youngsters
sponsor As the three pups entered the enclosure the judges halfshut
eyes rested on Bruceat first idly then in real amazement Crossing
to the Master before giving the signal for the first maneuvers he
said in tired disgust

Please take your measly St Bernard monstrosity out of the ring This
is a class for collies not for freaks I refuse to judge that pup as a
collie

Hes a thoroughbred crossly protested the Master I have his
certified pedigree Theres no better blood in

I dont care what his ancestors were snapped the judge Hes a
throwback to the dinosaur or the Great Auk And I wont judge him as a
collie Take him out of the ring Youre delaying the others

A judges decision is final Red with angry shame and suppressing an
unworthy desire to kick the luckless Bruce the Master led the pup back
to his allotted bench Bruce trotted cheerily along with a maddening
air of having done something to be proud of Deaf to the Mistresss
sympathy and to her timidly voiced protests the Master scrawled on an
envelopeback the words For Sale Name Your Own Price and pinned it
on the edge of the bench

Here endeth the first lesson in collieraising so far as The Place is
concerned he decreed stalking back to the ringside to watch the rest
of the judging

The Mistress lingered behind to bestow a furtive consolatory pat upon
the disqualified Bruce Then she joined her husband beside the ring

It was probably by accident that her skirt brushed sharply against the
benchedge as she wentknocking the For Sale sign down into the
litter of straw below

But a wellmeaning fellowexhibitor across the aisle saw the bit of
paper flutter floorward This good soul rescued it from the straw and
pinned it back in place

The world is full of helpful folk That is perhaps one reason why the
Millenniums date is still so indefinite

An hour later a man touched the Master on the arm

That dog of yours on Bench 48 began the stranger the big pup with
the For Sale sign on his bench What do you want for him

The Mistress was several feet away talking to the superintendent of
the show Guiltily yet gratefully the Master led the wouldbe
purchaser back to the benches without attracting his wifes notice

A few minutes afterward he returned to where she and the superintendent
were chatting

Well said the Master trying to steel himself against his wifes
possible disappointment I found a buyer for Brucea Dr Halding
from New York He likes the pup Says Bruce looks as if he was strong
and had lots of endurance I wonder if he wants him for a sledgedog
He paid me fifteen dollars for him and it was a mighty good bargain I
was lucky to get more than a nickel for such a cur

The Master shot forth this speech in almost a single rapid breath
Then before his wife could replyand without daring to look into her
troubled eyeshe discovered an acquaintance on the far side of the
ring and bustled off to speak to him The Master you see was a
husband not a hero

The Mistress turned a worried gaze on the superintendent

It was best I suppose she said bravely We agreed he must be sold
if the judge decided he was not any good But Im sorry For Im fond
of him Im sorry he is going to live in New York too A big city is
no place for a big dog I hope this Dr Halding will be nice to the
poor puppy

DrWHO sharply queried the superintendent who had not caught the
name when the Master had spoken it in his rapidfire speech Dr
Halding Of New York Huh

You neednt worry about the effect of city life on your dog he went
on with venomous bitterness The pup wont have a very long spell of
it If I had my way that man Halding would be barred from every
dogshow and stuck in jail Its an old trick of his to buy up
thoroughbreds cheap at shows The bigger and the stronger they are
the more he pays for them He seems to think pedigreed dogs are better
for his filthy purposes than street curs They have a higher nervous
organism I suppose The swine

What do you mean asked the Mistress puzzled by his vehemence I
dont

You must have heard of Halding and his socalled research work the
superintendent went on He is one of the most notorious
vivisectionists in

The superintendent got no further He was talking to empty air The
Mistress had fled Her determined small figure made a tumbled wake
through the crowd as she sped toward Bruces bench The puppy was no
longer there In another second the Mistress was at the door of the
building

A line of parked cars was stretched across the opposite side of the
village street Into one of these cars a large and loosejointed man
was lifting a large and loosejointed dog The dog did not like his
treatment and was struggling pathetically in vain awkwardness to get
free

Bruce called the Mistress fiercely as she dashed across the street

The puppy heard the familiar voice and howled for release Dr Halding
struck him roughly over the head and scrambled into the machine with
him reaching with his one disengaged hand for the selfstarter button
Before he could touch it the Mistress was on the runningboard of the
car

As she ran she had opened her wristbag Now flinging on the
runabouts seat a ten and a fivedollar bill she demanded

Give me my dog There is the money you paid for him

He isnt for sale grinned the Doctor Stand clear please Im
starting

Youre doing nothing of the sort was the hot reply Youll give
back my dog Do you understand

For answer Halding reached again toward his selfstarter A renewed
struggle from the whimpering puppy frustrated his aim and forced him to
devote both hands to the subduing of Bruce The dog was making frantic
writhings to get to the Mistress She caught his furry ruff and raged
on sick with anger

I know who you are and what you want this poor frightened puppy for
You shant have him There seems to be no law to prevent human devils
from strapping helpless dogs to a table and torturing them to death in
the unholy name of science But if there isnt a corner waiting for
them below its only because Hades cant be made hot enough to punish
such men as they ought to be punished Youre not going to torture
Bruce Theres your money Let go of him

You talk like all silly sloppy sentimentalists scoffed the Doctor
his slight German accent becoming more noticeable as he continued A
woman cant have the intellect to understand our services to humanity
We

Neither have half the real doctors she flashed Fully half of them
deny that vivisection ever helped humanity And half the remainder say
they are in doubt They cant point to a single definite case where it
has been of use Alienists say its a distinct form of mental
perversionthe craving to torture dumb animals to death and to make
scientific notes of their sufferings

Pah he sniffed I

She hurried on

If humanity cant be helped without cutting live dogs and kittens to
shreds in slow agonythen so much the worse for humanity If you
vivisectors would be content to practice on one anotheror on
condemned murderersinstead of on friendly and innocent dogs thered
be no complaint from any one But leave our pets alone Let go of my
puppy

By way of response the Doctor grunted in lofty contempt At the same
time he tucked the wriggling dog under his right arm holding him thus
momentarily safe and pressed the selfstarter button

There was a subdued whir A move of Haldings foot and a release of the
brake and the car started forward

Stand clear he ordered Im going

The jolt of the sudden start was too much for the Mistresss balance on
the runningboard Back she toppled Only by luck did she land on her
feet instead of her head upon the greasy pavement of the street

But she sprang forward again with a little cry of indignant dismay
and reached desperately into the moving car for Bruce calling him
eagerly by name

Dr Halding was steering with his left hand while his viselike right
arm still encircled the protesting collie As the Mistress ran
alongside and grasped frantically for her doomed pet he let go of
Bruce for an instant to fend off her handor perhaps to thrust her
away from the peril of the fastmoving mudguards At the Mistresss
cryand at the brief letup of pressure caused by the Doctors menacing
gesture toward the unhappy womanBruces longsleeping soul awoke He
answered the cry and the mans blow at his deity in the immemorial
fashion of all dogs whose human gods are threatened

There was a snarling wildbeast growl the first that ever had come
from the clownlike puppys throatand Bruce flung his unwieldy young
body straight for the vivisectors throat

Halding with a vicious fistlunge sent the pup to the floor of the
car in a crumpled heap but not before the curving white eyeteeth had
slashed the side of the mans throat in an ugly fleshwound that drove
its way dangerously close to the jugular

Half stunned by the blow and with the breath knocked out of him Bruce
none the less gathered himself together with lightning speed and
launched his bulk once more for Haldings throat

This time he missed his markfor several things happened all at once

At the dogs first onslaught Haldings foot had swung forward along
with his fist in an instinctive kick The kick did not reach Bruce
But it landed full and effectively on the accelerator

The powerful car responded to the touch with a bound And it did so at
the very moment that the flash of white teeth at his throat made
Halding snatch his own left hand instinctively from the steeringwheel
in order to guard the threatened spot

A second later the runabout crashed at full speed into the wall of a
house on the narrow streets opposite side

The rest was chaos

When a crowd of idlers and a policeman at last righted the wrecked car
two bodies were found huddled inertly amid a junkheap of splintered
glass and shivered wood and twisted metal The local ambulance carried
away one of these limp bodies The Places car rushed the smashups
other senseless victim to the office of the nearest veterinary Dr
Halding with a shattered shoulderblade and a fractured nose and jaw
and a mild case of brainconcussionwas received as a guest of honor
at the village hospital

Bruce his left foreleg broken and a nasty assortment of glasscuts
marring the fluffiness of his fur was skillfully patched up by the
vet and carried back that night to The Place

The puppy had suddenly taken on a new value in his owners eyespartly
for his gallantly puny effort at defending the Mistress partly because
of his pitiful condition And he was nursed right zealously back to
life and health

In a few weeks the plaster cast on the convalescents broken foreleg
had been replaced by a bandage In another week or two the vet
pronounced Bruce as well as ever The dog through habit still held
the mended foreleg off the ground even after the bandage was removed
Whereat the Master tied a bandage tightly about the uninjured foreleg

Bruce at once decided that this and not the other was the lame leg
and he began forthwith to limp on it As it was manifestly impossible
to keep both forelegs off the ground at the same time when he was
walking he was forced to make use of the oncebroken leg Finding to
his amaze that he could walk on it with perfect ease he devoted his
limping solely to the well leg And as soon as the Master took the
bandage from that Bruce ceased to limp at all

Meanwhile a lawyer whose name sounded as though it had been culled
from a Rhine Wine list had begun suit in Dr Haldings name against
the Mistress as a contributory cause of his clients accident The
suit never came to trial It was dropped indeed with much haste Not
from any change of heart on the plaintiffs behalf but because at
that juncture Dr Halding chanced to be arrested and interned as a
dangerous Enemy Alien Our country had recently declared war on
Germany and the belated spyhunt was up

During the Federal officers search of the doctors house for
treasonable documents of which they found an ample supply they came
upon his laboratory No fewer than five dogs in varying stages of
hideous torture were found strapped to tables or hanging to
wallhooks The vivisector bewailed loudly and gutturally this cruel
interruption to his researches in Sciences behalf

One day two months after the accident Bruce stood on all four feet
once more with no vestige left of scars or of lameness And then for
the first time a steady change that had been so slow as to escape any
ones notice dawned upon the Mistress and the Master It struck them
both at the same moment And they stared dully at their pet

The shapeless bumptious foolish Pest of two months ago had vanished
In his place by a very normal process of naturemagic stood a
magnificently stately thoroughbred collie

The big head had tapered symmetrically and had lost its puppy
formlessness It was now a head worthy of Landseers own pencil The
bonily awkward body had lengthened and had lost its myriad knobs and
angles It had grown massively graceful

The former thatch of halfcurly and indeterminately yellowish fuzz had
changed to a rough tawny coat wavy and unbelievably heavy stippled at
the ends with glossy black There was a strange depth and repose and
Soul in the dark eyesyes and a keen intelligence too

It was the old story of the Ugly Duckling all over again

Why gasped the Mistress Heshes BEAUTIFUL And I never knew it

At her loved voice the great dog moved across to where she sat Lightly
he laid one little white paw on her knee and looked gravely up into her
eyes

Hes got sense too chimed in the Master Look at those eyes if
you doubt it Theyre alive with intelligence Itsits a miracle He
cant be the same worthless whelp I wanted to get rid of He CANT

And he was not The long illness at the most formative time of the
dogs growth had done its work in developing what all the time had
lain latent The same illnessand the longenforced personal touch
with humanshad done an equally transforming work on the puppys
undeveloped mind The ThackerayWashingtonLincolnBismarck simile had
held good

What looked like a miracle was no more than the same beautifully simple
process which Nature enacts every day when she changes an awkward and
dirtcolored cygnet into a glorious swan or a leggily gawky colt into a
superb Derbywinner But Bruces metamorphosis seemed none the less
wonderful in the eyes of the two people who had learned to love him

Somewhere in the hideous wreck of Dr Haldings motorcar the dog had
found a souland the rest had followed as a natural course of growth

At the autumn dogshow in Hampton a darksableandwhite collie of
unwonted size and beauty walked proudly into the ring close to the
Mistresss side when the puppy class was calleda class that includes
all dogs under twelve months old Six minutes later the Mistress was
gleesomely accepting the firstprize blue ribbon for best puppy
from Judge Symonds own gnarled hand

Then came the other classes for colliesNovice Open Limit
Local American Bred And as Bruce paced majestically out of the
ring at last he was the possessor of five more blue ribbonsas well
as the blue Winners rosette for best collie in the show

Great dog youve got there madam commented Symonds in solemn
approval as he handed the Winners rosette to the Mistress Fine dog
in every way Fine promise He will go far One of the best types
Ive

Do you really think so sweetly replied the Mistress Why one of
the foremost collie judges in America has gone on record as calling him
a measly St Bernard monstrosity

No snorted Symonds incredulous You dont say so A judge who
would speak so of that dog doesnt understand his business He

Oh yes he does contradicted the Mistress glancing lovingly at her
handful of blue ribbons I think he understands his business very well
indeedNOW



CHAPTER III The War Dog

The guest had decided to wait until next morning before leaving The
Place instead of following his first plan of taking a night train to
New York He was a captain in our regular army and had newly come back
from France to forget an assortment of shrapnelbites and to teach
practical tactics to rookies

He reached his decision to remain over night at The Place while he and
the Mistress and the Master were sitting on the vinehung west veranda
after dinner watching the flood of sunset change the lake to molten
gold and the sky to pink fire It would be pleasant to steal another
few hours at this backcountry House of Peace before returning to the
humdrum duties of camp And the guest yielded to the temptation

Im mighty glad you can stay over till morning said the Master
Ill send word to Roberts not to bring up the car

As he spoke he scrawled a penciled line on an envelopeback then he
whistled

From a cool loungingplace beneath the wistariavines arose a huge
colliestately of form dark brown and white of coat deepset of eye
and with a head that somehow reminded one of a Landseer engraving The
collie trotted up the steps of the veranda and stood expectant before
the Master The latter had been folding the envelope lengthwise Now he
slipped it through the ring in the dogs collar

Give it to Roberts he said

The big collie turned and set off at a handgallop

Good approved the guest Bruce didnt seem to be in any doubt as to
what you wanted him to do He knows where Roberts is likely to be

No said the Master But he can track him and find him if Roberts
is anywhere within a mile or so from here That was one of the first
things we taught himto carry messages All we do is to slip the paper
into his collarring and tell him the name of the person to take it to
Naturally he knows us all by name So it is easy enough for him to do
it We look on the trick as tremendously clever But thats because we
love Bruce Almost any dog can be taught to do it I suppose We

Youre mistaken corrected the guest Almost any dog CANT be taught
to Some dogs can of course but they are the exception I ought to
know for Ive been where dogcouriers are a decidedly important
feature of trenchwarfare I stopped at one of the dogtraining schools
in England too on my way back from Picardy and watched the teaching
of the dogs that are sent to France and Flanders Not one in ten can be
trained to carry messages and not one in thirty can be counted on to
do it reliably You ought to be proud of Bruce

We are replied the Mistress He is one of the family We think
everything of him He was such a stupid and awkward puppy too Then
in just a few months he shaped up as he is now And his brain woke

Bruce interrupted the talk by reappearing on the veranda The folded
envelope was still in the ring on his collar The guest glanced
furtively at the Master expecting some sign of chagrin at the collies
failure

Instead the Master took the envelope unfolded it and glanced at a
word or two that had been written beneath his own scrawl then he made
another penciled addition to the envelopes writing stuck the twisted
paper back into the ring and said

Roberts

Off trotted Bruce on his second trip

I had forgotten to say which train youll have to take in the
morning explained the Master So Roberts wrote asking what time he
was to have the car at the door after breakfast It was careless of me

The guest did not answer But when Bruce presently returnedthis time
with no paper in his collarringthe officer passed his hand
appraisingly through the dogs heavy coat and looked keenly down into
his dark eyes

Gunshy asked the guest Or perhaps hes never heard a gun fired

Hes heard hundreds of guns fired said the Master I never allow a
gun to be fired on The Place of course because weve made it a bird
refuge But Bruce went with us in the car to the testing of the Lewis
machineguns up at Haskell They made a most ungodly racket But
somehow it didnt seem to bother the Big Dog at all

Hm mused the guest his professional interest vehemently roused
He would be worth a fortune over there There are a lot of collies in
the service in one capacity or anotheralmost as many as the
Airedales and the police dogs And they are doing grand work But I
never saw one that was better fitted for it than Bruce Its a pity he
lives on the wrong side of the Atlantic He could do his bit to more
effect than the average human There are hundreds of thousands of men
for the ranks but pitifully few perfect courierdogs

The Mistress was listening with a tensity which momentarily grew more
painful The Masters forehead too was creased with a new thought
that seemed to hurt him To break the brief silence that followed the
guests words he asked

Are the dogs over there really doing such great work as the papers
say they are I read the other day

Great work repeated the guest I should say so Not only in
finding the wounded and acting as guards on listening posts and all
that but most of all as couriers There are plenty of times when the
wireless cant be used for sending messages from one point to another
and where there is no telephone connection and where the firing is too
hot for a human courier to get through That is where is the war dogs
have proved their weight in radium Collies mostly There are a
million true stories of their prowess told at campfires Here are
just two such incidentsboth of them on record by the way at the
British War Office

A collie down near Soissons was sent across a bad strip of
firescourged ground with a message A boche sharpshooter fired at him
and shattered his jaw The dog kept on in horrible agony and
delivered the message Another collie was sent over a still hotter and
much longer stretch of territory with a message That was during the
Somme drive of 1916 He was shot at a dozen times as he ran At last
two bullets got him He fell over mortally wounded He scrambled to
his feet and kept on falling stumbling staggeringtill he got to his
destination Then he dropped dead at the side of the Colonel the
message had been sent to And those are only two of thousands of true
collieanecdotes Yet some fools are trying to get American dogs done
away with as nonutilitarian while the war lasts As if the dogs in
France today werent earning their overseas brothers right to
liveand live well

Neither of his hearers made reply when the guest finished his earnest
eager recital Neither of them had paid much heed to his final words
For the Master and the Mistress were looking at each other in mute
unhappiness The same miserable thought was in the mind of each And
each knew the thought that was torturing the mind of the other

Presently at a glint of inquiry in the Masters eye the Mistress
suddenly bent over and buried her face in the deep mass of Bruces ruff
as the dog stood lovingly beside her Then still stroking the collies
silken head she returned her husbands wretchedly questioning glance
with a resigned little nod The Master cleared his throat noisily
before he could speak with the calm indifference he sought Then
turning to the apparently unnoticing guest he said

I think I told you I tried to get across to France at the very
startand I was barred because I am past forty and because I have a
bum heart and several other defects that a soldier isnt supposed to
have My wife and I have tried to do what little we can for the Cause
on this side of the ocean But it has seemed woefully little when we
remember what others are doing And we have no son we can send

Again he cleared his throat and went on with sulky ungraciousness

We both know what youve been driving at for the past five minutes
Andand we agree Bruce can go

Great applauded the guest Thats fine Hell be worth his

If you think were a couple of fools for not doing this more
willingly went on the Master with savage earnestness just stop to
think what it means to a man to give up the dog he loves Not to give
him up to some one who will assure him a good home but to send him
over into that hell where a German bullet or a shellfragment or
hunger or disease is certain to get him soon or late To think of him
lying smashed and helpless somewhere in No Mans Land waiting for
death or caught by the enemy and eaten The Red Cross bulletin says
no less than eight thousand dogs were eaten in Saxony alone in 1913
the year BEFORE the war began Or else to be captured and then cut up
by some German vivisectorsurgeon in the sacred interests of Science
Oh we can bring ourselves to send Bruce over there But dont expect
us to do it with a good grace For we cant

I began the embarrassed guest but the Mistress chimed in her
sweet voice not quite steady

You see Captain weve made such a petsuch a babyof Bruce All
his life he has lived herehere where he had the woods to wander in
and the lake to swim in and this house for his home He will be so
unhappy andWell dont lets talk about that When I think of the
people who give their sons and everything they have to the country I
feel ashamed of not being more willing to let a mere dog go But then
Bruce is not just a mere dog He ishe is BRUCE All I ask is that
if he is injured and not killed youll arrange to have him sent back
here to us Well pay for it of course And will you write to whomever
you happen to know at that dogtraining school in England and ask
that Bruce be treated nicely while he is training there Hes never
been whipped Hes never needed it you see


The Mistress might have spared herself much worry as to Bruces
treatment in the training school to which he was consigned It was not
a place of cruelty but of development And when out of the thousands
of dogs sent there the corps of trainers found one with promise of
strong ability such a pupil was handled with all the care and
gentleness and skill that a temperamental prima donna might expect

Such a dog was the big American collie debarked from a goods car at
the training camp railway station six weeks after the Mistress and the
Master had consented to his enlistment And the handlers treated him
accordingly

The Master himself had taken Bruce to the transport in Brooklyn and
had led him aboard the overfull ship The new sights and sounds around
him interested the homebred collie But when the Master turned him
over to the officer in whose charge he was to be for the voyage
Bruces deepset eyes clouded with a sudden heartsick foreboding

Wrenching himself free from the friendly hand on his collar he sprang
in pursuit of his departing deitythe loved Master who was leaving
him alone and desolate among all these strange scenes and noises The
Master plodding sullen and heavyhearted toward the gangway was
aware of a cold nose thrust into his dejected hand

Looking down he beheld Bruce staring up at him with a world of stark
appeal in his troubled gaze The Master swallowed hard then laid his
hand on the beautiful head pressed so confidingly against his knee
Turning he led the dog back to the quarters assigned to him

Stay here old friend he commanded huskily Its all right Youll
make good I know that And theres a chance in a billion that youll
come back to us ImIm not deserting you And I guess theres
precious little danger that any one on The Place will ever forget you
Itsits all right Millions of humans are doing it Id give
everything Ive got if I could go too ITS ALL RIGHT

Then Bruce understood at last that he was to stay in this place of
abominations far from everything he loved and that he must do so
because the Master ordained it He made no further effort to break away
and to follow his god ashore But he shivered convulsively from head to
foot and his desolate gaze continued to trace the Masters receding
figure out of sight Then with a long sigh he lay down heavily his
head between his white forepaws and resigned himself to whatever of
future misery his deities might have ordained for him

Ensued a fortnight of mental and bodily anguish as the inlandreared
dog tasted the horrors of a voyage in a rolling ship through heaving
seas Afterward came the landing at a British port and the train ride
to the camp which was to be his home for the next three months

Bruces sense of smell told him the camp contained more dogs than ever
he had beheld in all his brief life put together But his hearing would
have led him to believe there were not a dozen other dogs within a mile
of him

From the encampment arose none of the rackety barking which betokens
the presence of many canines and which deafens visitors to a dogshow

One of the camps first and most stringent rules forbade barking
except under special order These dogsor the pick of themwere
destined for work at the front The bark of a dog has a carrying
quality greater than the combined shouting of ten men It is the last
sound to follow a balloonist after he has risen above the reach of all
other earthnoises

Hence a chance bark rising through the night to where some enemy
airman soared with engines turned off might well lead to the bombing
of hitherto unlocated trenches or detachmentcamps For this and divers
other reasons the first lesson taught to arriving wardogs was to
abstain from barking

The dogs were divided roughly by breeds as regarded the line of
training assigned to them The collies were taught courierwork The
Airedales toohideous cruel snakeheadedwere used as couriers
as well as to bear Red Cross supplies and to hunt for the wounded The
gaunt and wolflike police dogs were pressed into the two latter tasks
and were taught listeningpost duty And so on through all available
breedsincluding the stolidly wise Old English sheepdogs who were to
prove invaluable in finding and succoring and reporting the
woundeddown to the humble terriers and mongrels who were taught to
rid trenches of vermin

Everywhere was quiet efficiency and tirelessly patient and skillful
work on the part of the trainers For Britains best dog men had been
recruited for service here On the perfection of their charges
training might depend the fate of many thousand gallant soldiers
Wherefore the training was perfect

Hundreds of dogs proved stupid or unreliable or gunshy or too easily
confused in moments of stress These were weeded out continually and
shipped back to the masters who had proffered them

Others developed with amazing speed and cleverness grasping their
profession as could few human soldiers And Bruce lonely and
heartsore yet throwing himself into his labors with all the zest of
the best thoroughbred typewas one of this group

His early teachings now stood him in good stead What once had been a
jolly game for his own amusement and that of the Mistress and the
Master was now his lifework Steadily his trainer wrought over him
bringing out latent abilities that would have dumfounded his earliest
teachers steadying and directing the gayly dashing intelligence
upbuilding and rounding out all his native gifts

A dog of Bruces rare type made up to the trainers for the dullness of
their average pupils He learned with bewildering ease He never forgot
a lesson once taught

No the Mistress need not have interceded to save him from beating As
soon would an impresario think of thrashing Caruso or Paderewski as
would Bruces glum Scottish trainer have laid whip to this best pupil
of his Life was bare and strict for Bruce But life was never unkind
to him in these first months of exile from The Place And bit by bit
he began to take a joy in his work

Not for a dayperhaps not for an hour did the big collie forget the
home of his babyhood or those he had delighted to worship there And
the look of sadness in his dark eyes became a settled aspect Yet
here there was much to interest and to excite him And he grew to look
forward with pleasure to his daily lessons

At the end of three months he was shipped to France There his
seemingly aimless studies at the training camp were put to active use

     

At the foot of the long Flanders hillslope the HereWeCome
Regiment of mixed American and French infantry held a
caterpillarshaped line of trenches

To the right a few hundred yards away was posted a Lancashire
regiment supported by a battalion from Cornwall On the left were two
French regiments In front facing the hillslope and not a halfmile
distant was the geometric arrangement of sandbags that marked the
contour of the German firstline trenches

The hill behind them the boches in front of them French and British
troops on either side of themthe HereWeComes were helping to defend
what was known as a quiet sector Behind the hill and on loftier
heights far to the rear the Allied artillery was posted Somewhere in
the same general locality lay a division of British reserves

It is almost a waste of words to have described thus the surroundings
of the HereWeComes For with no warning at all those entire
surroundings were about to be changed

Ludendorff and his little playmates were just then engaged in the
congenial sport of delivering unexpected blows at various successive
points of the Allied line in an effort to find some spot that was soft
enough to cave in under the impact and let through a horde of grayclad
Huns And though none of the defenders knew it this quiet sector had
been chosen for such a minor blow

The men in higher command back there behind the hill crest had a
belated inkling though of a proposed attack on the lightly defended
front trenches For the Allied airplanes which drifted in the upper
heavens like a scattered handful of dragonflies were not drifting
there aimlessly They were the eyes of the snakelike columns that
crawled so blindly on the scarred brown surface of the earth And those
eyes had discerned the massing of a force behind the German line had
discerned and had duly reported it

The attack might come in a day It might not come in a week But it was
comingunless the behindthelines preparations were a gigantic feint

A quiet dawn in the quiet trenches of the quiet sector Desultory
artillery and somewhat less desultory sniping had prevailed throughout
the night and at daybreak but nothing out of the ordinary

Two men on listeningpost had been shot and so had an overcurious
sentry who peeped just an inch too far above a parapet A shell had
burst in a trench knocking the telephone connection out of gear and
half burying a squad of sleepers under a lot of earth Otherwise
things were drowsily dull

In a dugout sprawled TopSergeant Mahanformerly of Uncle Sams
regular army playing an uninspiring game of poker with Sergeant Dale
of his company and Sergeant Vivier of the French infantry The
Frenchman was slow in learning pokers mysteries

And anyway all three men were temporarily penniless and were forced
to play for IOUswhich is stupid sport at best

So when from the German line came a quick sputtsputtsputt from a
halfdozen sharpshooters rifles all three men looked up from their
desultory game in real interest Mahan got to his feet with a grunt

Some other fool has been trying to see how far he can rubber above the
sandbags without drawing boche fire he hazarded starting out to
investigate Its a miracle to me how a boche bullet can go through
heads that are so full of firstquality ivory as those rubberers

But Mahans strictures were quite unwarranted The sharpshooters were
not firing at the parapet Their scattering shots were flying high and
hitting against the slope of the hill behind the trenches

Adown this shellpocked hillside as Mahan and the other disturbed
idlers gazed came cantering a huge darkbrownandwhite collie The
morning wind stirred the black stippling that edged his tawny fur
showing the goldgray undercoat beneath it His white chest was like a
snowdrift and offered a fine mark for the German rifles A bullet or
two sang whiningly past his gayly upflung head

A hundred voices from the HereWeCome trenches hailed the advancing
dog

Why its Bruce cried Mahan in glad welcome I might a known he
or another of the collies would be along I might a known it when
the telephones went out of commission He

Regardezdonc interrupted the admiring Vivier He acts like bullets
was made of flies Mooch he care for boche leadpills ce brave vieux

Yes growled Dale worriedly and one of these days a bullet will
find its way into that splendid carcass of his Hes been shot at a
thousand times to my own knowledge And all I ask is a chance with a
riflebutt at the skull of the Hun who downs him

Downs Bruce queried Vivier in fine scorn The boche he is no borned
who can do it Bruce has what you call it in Ainglish the charm
life He go safe where other caniche be pepperpotted full of holes
Ive watch heem I know

Unscathed by the several shots that whined past him Bruce came to a
halt at the edge of a traverse There he stood wagging his plume of a
tail in grave friendliness while a score of khakiclad arms reached up
to lift him bodily into the trench

A sergeant unfastened the message from the dogs collar and posted off
to the colonel with it

The message was similar to one which had been telephoned to each of the
supporting bodies to right and to left of the HereWeComes It bade
the colonel prepare to withdraw his command from the front trenches at
nightfall and to move back on the main force behind the hillcrest
The front trenches were not important and they were far too lightly
manned to resist a mass attack Wherefore the drawingin and
consolidating of the whole outflung line

Bruce his work done now had leisure to respond to the countless
offers of hospitality that encompassed him One man brought him a slice
of cold broiled bacon Another spread porkgrease over a bit of bread
and proffered it A third unearthed from some sacredly guarded
hidingplace an excessively stale halfinch square of sweet chocolate

Had the dog so chosen he might then and there have eaten himself to
death on the multitude of votive offerings But in a few minutes he had
had enough and he merely sniffed in polite refusal at all further
gifts

See lectured Mahan Thats the beast of it When you say a fellow
eats or drinks like a beast you ought to remember that a beast wont
eat or drink a mouthful more than is good for him

Gee commented the somewhat corpulent Dale Im glad Im not a
beastespecially on payday

Presently Bruce tired of the ovation tendered him These ovations were
getting to be an old story They had begun as far back as his
trainingcamp dayswhen the story of his joining the army was told by
the man to whom The Places guest had written commending the dog to the
trainers kindness

At the trainingcamp this story had been reenforced by the chief
collieteachera dour little Hieland Scot named McQuibigaskie who on
the first day declared that the American dog had more sense and more
promise and more soul than a tother tykes south o Kirkcudbright
Brae

Being only mortal Bruce found it pleasanter to be admired and petted
than ignored or kicked He was impersonally friendly with the soldiers
when he was off duty and he relished the dainties they were forever
thrusting at him

But at times his soft eyes would grow dark with homesickness for the
quiet loveliness of The Place and for the Mistress and the Master who
were his loyally worshiped gods Life had been so happy and so sweetly
uneventful for him at The Place And there had been none of the awful
endless thunder and the bewilderingly horrible smells and gruesome
sights which here met him at every turn

The dogs loving heart used to grow sick with it all and he longed
unspeakably for home But he was a gallant soldier and he did his work
not only well but with a snap and a dash and an almost uncanny
intelligence which made him an idol to the men

Presently now having eaten all he wanted and having been patted and
talked to until he craved solitude Bruce strolled ever to an empty
dugout curled up on a torn blanket there put his nose between his
white paws and went to sleep

The German artilleryfire had swelled from an occasional explosion to a
ceaseless roar that made the ground vibrate and heave and that beat
on the eardrums with nauseating iterance But it did not bother Bruce
For months he had been used to this sort of annoyance and he had
learned to sleep snugly through it all

Meanwhile outside his dugout life was speeding up at a dizzying rate
The German artillery had sprung to sudden and wholesale activity Far
to the right of the HereWeCome regiments trenches a haze had begun
to crawl along the ground and to send snaky tendrils high in
airtendrils that blended into a single grayishgreen wall as they
moved forward The hazewalls graygreen was shot by yellow and purple
tinges as the suns weak rays touched it To the left of the
HereWeComes and then in front of them appeared the same wall of
billowing gas

The HereWeComes were ready for it with their hastily donned masks
But there was no need of the precaution By one of the sudden
windfreaks so common in the story of the war the gascloud was cleft
in two by a swirling breeze and it rolled dankly on to right and
left leaving the central trenches clear

Now an artillery barrage accompanied or followed by a
gasdemonstration can mean but one thing a general attack Therefore
telephonic word came to the detachments to left and right of the
HereWeComes to fall back under cover of the gascloud to safer
positions Two dogs were sent with the same order to the
HereWeComes One of the dogs was gassed A bit of shrapnel found the
other

Thus it was that the HereWeComes were left alone though they did not
know it to hold the positionwith no support on either side and
with a mere handful of men wherewith to stem the impending rush

On the heels of the dispersing gascloud and straight across the
halfmile or less of broken ground came a line of gray In five
successive waves according to custom the boches charged Each wave
hurled itself forward as fast as efficiency would let it in face of
the opposing fire and as far as human endurance would be goaded Then
it went down and its survivors attached themselves to the succeeding
wave

Hence by the time the fifth and mightiest wave got into motion it was
swelled by the survivors of all four of its predecessors and was an
allbutresistless mass of shouting and running men

The rifles and machineguns of the HereWeComes played merrily into
the advancing gray swarms stopping wave after wave and at last
checking the fifth and master wave almost at the very brink of the
FrancoAmerican parapet

Thats how they do Mahan pantingly explained to a rather shaky
newcomer as the last wave fell back They count on numbers and
bullrushes to get them there If theyd had ten thousand men in that
rush instead of five thousand theyd have got us And if they had
twice as many men in their whole army as they have theyd win this
war But praise be they havent twice as many That is one of the
fiftyseven reasons why the Allies are going to lick Germany

Mahan talked jubilantly The same jubilation ran all along the line of
victors But the colonel and his staff were not rejoicing They had
just learned of the withdrawal of the forces to either side of them
and they knew they themselves could not hope to stand against a second
and larger charge

Such a charge the enemy were certain to make The Germans too must
soon learn of the defection of the supports It was now only a question
of an hour or less before a charge with a doubleenveloping movement
would surround and bag the HereWeComes catching the whole regiment
in an inescapable trap

To fall back now up that long bare hillside under full fire of the
augmented German artillery would mean a decimating of the entire
command The HereWeComes could not retreat They could not hope to
hold their ground The sole chance for life lay in the arrival of
strong reenforcements from the rear to help them hold the trenches
until night or to man the supporting positions Reserves were within
easy striking distance But as happened so many times in the war
there was no routine way to summon them in time

It was the chance sight of a crumpled message lying on his dugouttable
that reminded the colonel of Bruces existence and of his presence in
the front trench It was a matter of thirty seconds for the colonel to
scrawl an urgent appeal and a brief statement of conditions Almost as
soon as the note was ready an orderly appeared at the dugout entrance
convoying the newly awakened Bruce

The allimportant message was fastened in place The colonel himself
went to the edge of the traverse and with his own arms lifted the
eightypound collie to the top

There was tenderness as well as strength in the lifting arms As he set
Bruce down on the brink the colonel said as if speaking to a
fellowhuman

I hate to do it old chap I HATE to There isnt one chance in three
of your getting all the way up the hill alive But there wouldnt be
one chance in a hundred for a MAN The boches will be on the lookout
for just this move And their best sharpshooters will be waiting for
youeven if you dodge the shrapnel and the rest of the artillery Im
sorry Andgoodby

Then tersely he rasped out the command

Bruce Headquarters Headquarters QUICK

At a bound the dog was gone

Breasting the rise of the hill Bruce set off at a sweeping run his
tawnyandwhite mane flying in the wind

A thousand eyes from the HereWeCome trenches watched his flight
And as many eyes from the German lines saw the huge collies dash up
the coverless slope

Scarce had Bruce gotten fairly into his stride when the boche bullets
began to singnot a desultory little flurry of shots as before but
by the score and with a murderous earnestness When he had appeared
on his way to the trenches an hour earlier the Germans had opened
fire on him merely for their own amusementupon the same merry
principle which always led them to shoot at an Ally wardog But now
they understood his allimportant mission and they strove with their
best skill to thwart it

The colonel of the HereWeComes drew his breath sharply between his
teeth He did not regret the sending of the collie It had been a move
of stark military necessity And there was an off chance that it might
mean the saving of his whole command

But the colonel was fond of Bruce and it angered him to hear the
frantic effort of the boche marksmen to down so magnificent a creature
The bullets were spraying all about the galloping dog kicking up tiny
swirls of dust at his heels and in front of him and to either side

Mahan watching with streaming eyes and blaspheming lips recalled the
French sergeants theory that Bruce bore a charmed life And he prayed
that Vivier might be right But in his prayer was very little faith
For under such a fusillade it seemed impossible that at least one
highpower bullet should not reach the collie before the slope could be
traversed A fastrunning dog is not an easy mark for a
bulletespecially if the dog be a collie with a trace of
wolfancestry in his gait A dog at best does not gallop straight
ahead as does a horse There is almost always a sidewise lilt to his
run

Bruce was still further aided by the shellplowed condition of the
hillside Again and again he had to break his stride to leap some
shellhole Often he had to encircle such holes More than once he
bounded headlong down into a gaping crater and scrambled up its far
side These erratic moves and the ninehundredyard distance a
distance that was widening at every second made the sharpshooters
task anything but an exact science

Mahans gaze followed the dogs every step Bruce had cleared more than
threefourths of the slope The topsergeant permitted himself the
luxury of a broad grin

Ill buy Vivier all the redink wine he can gargle next payday he
vowed He was dead right about the dog No bullet was ever molded that
can get

Mahan broke off in his exultation with an explosive oath as a new
note in the firing smote upon his trained hearing

The swine he roared The filthy unsportsmanly dogeating Prussian
swine Theyre turning MACHINEGUNS on him

In place of the intermittent rattle of rifleshots now came the purring
cough of rapidfire guns The bullets hit the upper hillside in swathes
beginning a few yards behind the flying collie and moving upward toward
him like a sweeping of an unseen scythe

Thats the windup groaned Mahan Lord send me an even break
against one of those Hun machinegunners some day If

Again Mahan failed to finish his train of thought He stared
openmouthed up the hill Almost at the very summit within a rod or
two of the point where the crest would intervene between him and his
foes Bruce whirled in midair and fell prone

The fastfollowing swaths of machinegun bullets had not reached him
But another German enemy had From behind a heap of offal on the
crest a yellowgray dog had sprung and had launched himself bodily
upon Bruces flank as the unnoticing collie had flashed past him

The assailant was an enormous and hyenalike German policedog He was
one of the many of his breed that were employed for work or food in
the German camps and which used to sneak away from their hardkicking
soldierowners to ply a more congenial trade as scavengers and as
seekers for the dead For in traits as well as in looks the
policedog often emulates the ghoulish hyena

Seeing the approaching collie always inveterate foe of his kind the
policedog had gauged the distance and had launched his surprise attack
with true Teuton sportsmanship and efficiency Down went Bruce under
the fierce weight that crashed against his shoulder But before the
other could gain his coveted throatgrip Bruce was up again Like a
furry whirlwind he was at the policedog fighting more like a wolf
than a civilized collietearing into his opponent with a maniac rage
snapping slashing his glittering white fangs driving at a dozen
vulnerable points in a single second

It was as though Bruce knew he had no time to waste from his
lifeanddeath mission He could not elude this enemy so he must
finish him as quickly as possible

Give me your rifle sputtered Mahan to the soldier nearest him Ill
take one potshot at that Prussian cur before the machineguns get the
two of em Even if I hit Bruce by mistake hed rather die by a
Christian Yankeemade bullet than

Just then the scythelike machinegun fire reached the hillcrest
combatants And in the same instant a shell smote the ground
apparently between them Up went a geyser of smoke and dirt and rocks
When the cloud settled there was a deep gully in the ground where a
moment earlier Bruce and the policedog had waged their deathbattle

That settles it muttered the colonel

And he went to make ready for such puny defense as his men might hope
to put up against the German rush

While these futile preparations were still under way terrific
artillery fire burst from the Allied batteries behind the hill
shielding the HereWeCome trenches with a curtain of fire whose lower
folds draped themselves right unlovingly around the German lines Under
cover of this barrage down the hill swarmed the Allied reserves

How did you get word demanded the astonished colonel of the
HereWeComes later in the day

From your note of course replied the general he had questioned
The collieold Bruce

Bruce babbled the colonel foolishly

Of course answered the general Who else But Im afraid its the
last message hell ever deliver He came rolling and staggering up to
headquartersone mass of blood and three inches thick with caked
dirt His right side was torn open from a shellwound and he had two
machinegun bullets in his shoulder Hes deaf as a post too from
shellshock He tumbled over in a heap on the steps of headquarters
But he GOT there Thats Bruce all over Thats the best type of
collie all over Some of us were for putting him out of his misery
with a shot through the head Wed have done it too if it had been
any other dog But the surgeongeneral waded in and took a hand in the
gamecarried Bruce to his own quarters We left him working over the
dog himself And he swears Bruce will pull through



CHAPTER IV When Eyes Were No Use

Yes its an easy enough trade to pick up lectured TopSergeant
Mahan formerly of the regular army Youve just got to remember a few
things But youve got to keep on remembering those few all the time
If you forget one of em its the last bit of forgetting youre ever
likely to do

TopSergeant Mahan of the mixed FrenchandAmerican regiment known as
HereWeCome was squatting at ease on the trench firingstep From
that professorial seat he was dispensing useful knowledge to a group of
fellowcountrymennewly arrived from the base to pad the
HereWeCome ranks which had been thinned at the Rache attack

What sort of things have we got to remember Sergeant jauntily asked
a lanky Missourian Weve got the drill pretty pat and the trench
instructions and

Gee ejaculated Mahan I had no idea of that Then why dont you
walk straight ahead into Berlin If you know all you say you do about
war theres nothing more for you to learn Ill drop a line to General
Foch and suggest to him that you rookies be detailed to teach the game
to us oldsters

I didnt mean to be fresh apologized the jaunty one Wont you go
ahead and tell us the things we need to remember

Well exhorted Mahan appeased by the newcomers humility there
arent so many of them after all Learn to duck when you hear a
Minnie grunt or a whizzbang cut loose or a fivenine begin to whimper
Learn not to bother to duck when the rifles get to jabberingfor
youll never hear the bullet that gets you Study the nocturnal habits
of machineguns and the ways of snipers and the right time not to play
the fool And keep saying to yourself The bullet aint molded that
can get ME Mean it when you say it When youve learned those few
things the rest of the wargame is dead easy

Except timidly amended old Sergeant Vivier the gray little
Frenchman except when eyes areare what you call it no use
Thats right assented Mahan In the times when eyes are no use all
rules fail And then the only thing you can do is to trust to your
Yankee luck I remember

When eyes are no use repeated the recruit If you mean after
dark at nighthavent we got the searchlights and the starshells and
all that

Son replied Mahan we have Though I dont see how you ever guessed
such an important secret But since you know everything maybe youll
just kindly tell us what good all the lights in the world are going to
do us when the filthy yellowgray fog begins to ooze up out of the mud
and the shellholes and the filthy gray mist oozes down from the
clouds to meet it Fog is the one thing that all the warscience wont
overcome A fogpenetrator hasnt been invented yet If it had been
thered be many a husky lad living today who has gone West this past
few years on account of the fogs Fog is the boches pet It gives
Fritzy a lovely chance to creep up or us It

It is the helper of US too suggested old Vivier More than one
time it has kept me safe when I was on patrol And did it not help to
save us at Rache when

The fog may have helped us one per cent at Rache admitted Mahan
But Bruce did ninetynine per cent of the saving

A Scotch general asked the recruit as Vivier nodded cordial
affirmation of Mahans words and as others of the oldtimers muttered
approval

No contradicted Mahan A Scotch collie If you were dry behind the
ears in this life you wouldnt have to ask who Bruce is

I dont understand faltered the rookie suspicious of a possible
joke

You will soon Mahan told him Bruce will be here today I heard
the KO saying the big dog is going to be sent down with some
dispatches or something from headquarters Its his first trip since
he was cut up so

I am saving himthis proclaimed Vivier disgorging from the flotsam
of his pocket a lump of oncewhite sugar My wife she smuggle three
of these to me in her last paquet One I eat in my cafe noir one I
present to mon cher vieux ce bon Mahan one I keep for the grand dog
what save us all that day

Whats the idea queried the mystified rookie I dont

We were stuck in the front line of the Rache salient explained
Mahan eager to recount his dogfriends prowess On both sides our
supports got word to fall back We couldnt get the word because our
telephone connection was knocked galleywest There we were waiting
for a Hun attack to wipe us out We couldnt fall back for they were
peppering the hillslope behind us We were at the bottom Theyd have
cut us to ribbons if wed shown our carcasses in the open Bruce was
here with a message hed brought The KO sent him back to
headquarters for the reserves The boche heavies and snipers and
machineguns all cut loose to stop him as he scooted up the hill And a
measly giant of a German police dog tried to kill him too Bruce got
through the lot of them and he reached headquarters with the SOS call
that saved us The poor chap was cut and gouged and torn by bullets and
shellscraps and he was nearly dead from shellshock too But the
surgeon general worked over him himself and pulled him back to life
He

He is a loved pet of a man and a woman in your America I have heard
one say chimed in Vivier And his home there was in the quiet
country He was lent to the cause as a patriotic offering ce brave
And of a certainty he has earned his welcome

When Bruce an hour later trotted into the trenches on the way to the
HereWeCome colonels quarters he was received like a visiting
potentate Dozens of men hailed him eagerly by name as he made his way
to his destination with the message affixed to his collar

Many of these men were his wellremembered friends and comrades Mahan
and Vivier and one or two more he had grown to likeas well as he
could like any one in that land of horrors three thousand miles away
from The Place where he was born and from the Mistress and the
Master who were his loyally worshiped gods

Moreover being only mortal and afflicted with a hearty appetite Bruce
loved the food and other delicacies the men were forever offering him
as a variation on the stodgy fare dished out to him and his fellow
wardogs

As much to amuse and interest the soldiers whose hero he was as for
any special importance in the dispatch he carried Bruce had been sent
now to the trenches of the HereWeComes It was his first visit to the
regiment he had saved since the days of the Rache assault two months
earlier Thanks to supremely clever surgery and to tender care the dog
was little the worse for his wounds His hearing gradually had come
back In one shoulder he had a very slight stiffness which was not a
limp and a newhealed furrow scarred the left side of his tawny coat
Otherwise he was as good as new

As Bruce trotted toward the group that so recently had been talking of
him the Missouri recruit watched with interest for the dogs joy at
this reunion with his old friends Bruces snowy chest and
blackstippled coat were fluffed out by many recent baths His splendid
head high and his dark eyes bright the collie advanced toward the
group

Mahan greeted him joyously Vivier stretched out a hand which displayed
temptingly the longhoarded lump of sugar A third man produced from
nowhere in particular a large and meatfringed soupbone

I wonder which of you hell come to first said the interested
Missourian

The question was answered at once and right humiliatingly For Bruce
did not falter in his swinging stride as he came abreast of the group
Not by so much as a second glance did he notice Mahans hail and the
tempting food

As he passed within six inches of the lump of sugar which Vivier was
holding out to him the dogs silken ears quivered slightly sure sign
of hardrepressed emotion in a thoroughbred colliebut he gave no
other manifestation that he knew any one was there

Well Ill be blessed snickered the Missourian in high derision as
Bruce passed out of sight around an angle of the trench So thats the
pup who is such a pal of you fellows is he Gee but it was a treat to
see how tickled he was to meet you again

To the rookies amazement none of his hearers seemed in the least
chagrined over the dogs chilling disregard of them Instead Mahan
actually grunted approbation

Hell be back prophesied the Sergeant Dont you worry Hell be
back We ought to have had more sense than try to stop him when hes on
duty He has better discipline than the rest of us Thats one of very
first things they teach a courierdogto pay no attention to anybody
when hes on dispatch duty When Bruce has delivered his message to the
KO hell have the right to hunt up his chums And no one knows it
bettern Bruce himself

It was a sina thoughtlessnessof me to hold the sugar at him said
old Vivier Ah but he is a so good soldier ce brave Bruce He look
not to the left nor yet to the right nor yet to the sodesired
sugarlump He keep his head at attention All but the furry tips of
his ears Them he has not yet taught to be good soldiers They tremble
when he smell the sugar and the good soupbone They quiver like the
little leaf But he keep on He

There was a scurry of fastcantering feet Around the angle of the
trench dashed Bruce Head erect soft dark eyes shining with a light of
gay mischief he galloped up to the grinning Sergeant Vivier and stood
The dogs great plume of a tail was wagging violently His tulip ears
were cocked His whole interest in life was fixed on the precious lump
of sugar which Vivier held out to him

From puppyhood Bruce had adored lump sugar Even at The Place sugar
had been a rarity for him for the Mistress and the Master had known
the damage it can wreak upon a dogs teeth and digestion Yet once in
a while as a special luxury the Mistress had been wont to give him a
solitary lump of sugar

Since his arrival in France the dog had never seen nor scented such a
thing until now Yet he did not jump for the gift He did not try to
snatch it from Vivier Instead he waited until the old Frenchman held
it closer toward him with the invitation

Take it mon vieux It is for you

Then and then only did Bruce reach daintily forward and grip the grimy
bit of sugar between his mighty jaws Vivier stroked the collies head
while Bruce wagged his tail and munched the sugar and blinked
gratefully up at the donor Mahan looked on enviously A dogs got
fortytwo teeth instead of the thirtytwo that us humans have to chew
on observed the Sergeant A vet told me that once And sugar is bad
for all fortytwo of em Maybe you didnt know that Monsoo Vivier
Likely at this rate well have to chip in before long and buy poor
Brucie a double set of false teeth Just because youve put his real
ones out of business with lumps of sugar

Vivier looked genuinely concerned at this grim forecast Bruce wandered
across to the place where the donor of the soupbone brandished his
offering Other men too were crowding around with gifts

Between petting and feeding the collie spent a busy hour among his
comradesatarms He was to stay with the HereWeComes until the
following day and then carry back to headquarters a reconnaissance
report

At four oclock that afternoon the sky was softly blue and the air was
unwontedly clear By five oclock a gentle Indiasummer haze blurred
the worlds sharper outlines By six a blanketfog rolled in and the
air was wetly unbreatheable The fog lay so thick over the soggy earth
that objects ten feet away were invisible

This commented Sergeant Mahan is one of the times I was talking
about this morningwhen eyes are no use This is sure the country for
fogs in wartime The cockneys tell me the London fogs arent a patch
on em

The HereWeComes were encamped for the while at the edge of a
sector from whence all military importance had recently been removed by
a convulsive twist of a hundredmile battlefront In this dull
holeinacorner the newarrived rivets were in process of welding into
the more veteran structure of the mixed regiment

Not a quartermile awayacross No Mans Land and athwart two barriers
of barbed wirelay a series of German trenches Now in all
probability and from all outward signs the occupants of this boche
position consisted only of a regiment or two which had been so badly
cut up in a foiled drive as to need a month of nonexciting routine
before going back into more perilous service

Yet the commander of the division to which the HereWeComes were
attached did not trust to probabilities nor to outward signs He had
been at the front long enough to realize that the only thing likely to
happen was the thing which seemed unlikeliest And he felt a morbid
curiosity to learn more about the personnel of those dormant German
trenches

Wherefore he had sent an order that a handful of the HereWeComes go
forth into No Mans Land on the first favorable night and try to pick
up a boche prisoner or two for questioningpurposes A scouring of the
doubly wired area between the hostile lines might readily harvest some
solitary sentinel or some other man on special duty or even the
occupants of a listeningpost And the division commander earnestly
desired to question such prisoner or prisoners The fog furnished an
ideal night for such an expedition

Thus it was that a very young lieutenant and Sergeant Mahan and ten
privatesthe lanky Missourian among themwere detailed for the
prisonerseeking job At eleven oclock they crept over the top
single file

It was a night wherein a hundred searchlights and a million starflares
would not have made more impression on the density of the fog than
would the striking of a safety match Yet the twelve reconnoiterers
were instructed to proceed in the cautious manner customary to such
nocturnal expeditions into No Mans Land They moved forward at the
lieutenants order tiptoeing abreast some twenty feet apart from one
another and advancing in threefoot strides At every thirty steps the
entire line was required to halt and to reestablish contactin other
words to dress on the lieutenant who was at the extreme right

This maneuver was more timewasting and less simple than its recital
would imply For in the dark unaccustomed legs are liable to
miscalculation in the matter of length of stride even when shellholes
and other inequalities of ground do not complicate the calculations
still further And it is hard to maintain a perfectly straight line
when moving forward through choking fog and over scores of obstacles

The halts for realignment consumed much time and caused no little
confusion Nervousness began to encompass the Missouri recruit He was
as brave as the next man But there is something creepy about walking
with measured tread through an invisible space with no sound but the
stealthy padpadpad of equally hesitant footsteps twenty feet away on
either side The Missourian was grateful for the intervals that brought
the men into mutual contact as the eerie march continued

The first line of barbed wire was cut and passed Then followed an
endless groping progress across No Mans Land and several delays as
one man or another had trouble in finding contact with his neighbor

At last the party came to the German wires The lieutenant had drawn on
a rubber glove In his gloved hand he grasped a strip of steel which he
held in front of him like a wand fanning the air with it

As he came to the entanglement he probed the barbed wire carefully
with his wand watching for an ensuing spark For the Germans more than
once had been known to electrify their wires with fatal results to
luckless prowlers

These wires tonight were not charged And with pliers the
lieutenant and Mahan started to cut a passageway through them

As the very first strand parted under his pressure Mahan laid one hand
warningly on the lieutenants sleeve and then passed the same
prearranged warning down the line to the left

Silencemoveless tense sharply listening silencefollowed his
motion Then the rest of the party heard the sound which Mahans keener
ears had caught a moment earlierthe thud of many marching feet Here
was no furtive creeping as when the twelve Yankees had moved along
Rather was it the rhythmic beat of at least a hundred pairs of
shapeless army bootsperhaps of more The unseen marchers were moving
wordlessly but with no effort at muffling the even tread of their
multiple feet

Theyre coming this way breathed Sergeant Mahan almost without
sound his lips close to the excited young lieutenants ear And
theyre not fifty paces off That means theyre boches So near the
German wire our men would either be crawling or else charging not
marching Its a companymaybe a battalioncoming back from a
reconnaissance and making for a gap in their own wire some where near
here If we lay low theres an off chance they may pass us by

Without awaiting the lieutenants order Mahan passed along the signal
for every man to drop to earth and lie there He all but forced the
eagerly gesticulating lieutenant to the ground

On came the swinging tread of the Germans Mahan listening
breathlessly tried to gauge the distance and the direction He
figured presently that the break the Germans had made in their wire
could be only a few yards below the spot where he and the lieutenant
had been at work with the pliers Thus the intruders from their
present course must inevitably pass very close to the prostrate
Americansso close perhaps as to brush against the nearest of them
or even to step on one or more of the crouching figures

Mahan whispered to the man on his immediate left the rookie from
Missouri

Edge closer to the wireclose as you can wiggle and lie flat Pass
on the word

The Missourian obeyed Before writhing his long body forward against
the bristly mass of wire he passed the instructions on to the man at
his own left

But his nerves were at breakingpoint

It had been bad enough to crawl through the blind fog with the ghostly
steps of his comrades pattering softly at either side of him But it
was a thousand times harder to lie helpless here in the choking fog
and on the soaked ground while countless enemies were bearing down
unseen upon him on one side and an impenetrable wire cut off his
retreat on the other

The Missourian had let his imagination begin to work always a mistake
in a private soldier He was visualizing the moment when this tramping
German force should become aware of the presence of their puny foes and
should slaughter them against the merciless wires It would not be a
fair standup fight this murderrush of hundreds of men against twelve
who were penned in and could not maneuver nor escape And the thought
of it was doing queer things to the rookies overwrought nerves

Having passed the word to creep closer to the wires he began to
execute the order in person with no delay at all But he was a
fraction of a second too late The Germans were moving in
hikeformation with points thrown out in advance to either sidea
point being a private soldier who for scouting and other purposes
marches at some distance from the main body

The point ahead of the platoon had swerved too far to the left in
the blacknessan error that would infallibly have brought him up
against the wires with considerable force in another two steps But
the Missourian was between him and the wires And the points
heavyshod foot came down heel first on the back of the rookies
outgroping hand Such a crushing impact on the handback is one of
the most agonizing minor injuries a man can sustain And this fact the
Missourian discovered with great suddenness

His tootaut nerves forced from his throat a yell that split the
deathly stillness with an earpiercing vehemence He sprang to his
feet forgetful of orders intent only on thrusting his bayonet through
the Hun who had caused such acute torture to his hand Half way up the
rookies feet went out from under him in the slimy mud He caromed
against the point then fell headlong

The German doubtless thinking he had stumbled upon a single stray
American scout whirled his own rifle aloft to dash out the brains of
his luckless foe But before the upflung butt could descendbefore
the rookie could rise or dodgethe point added his quota to the rude
breaking of the nights silence He screamed in panic terror dropped
his brandished gun and reeled backward clawing at his own throat

For out of the eerie darkness something had launched itself at
himsomething silent and terrible that had flown to the Missourians
aid Down with a crash went the German on his back He rolled against
the Missourian who promptly sought to grapple with him

But even as he clawed for the German the rookies nerves wrung from
him a second yellthis time less of rage than of horror

Sufferin cats he bellowed Why didnt anybody ever tell me Germans
was covered with fur instead of clothes

The boche platoon was no longer striding along in hikeformation It
was broken up into masses of wildly running men all of them bearing
down upon the place whence issued this ungodly racket and turmoil
Stumbling reeling blindly falling and rising again they came on

Some one among them loosed a rifleshot in the general direction of the
yelling A second and a third German rifleman followed the example of
the first From the distant American trenches one or two snipers began
to pepper away toward the enemy lines though the fog was too thick for
them to see the German rifleflashes

The boches farthest to the left in the blind rush fouled with the
wires German snipers from behind the Hun parapets opened fire A
minute earlier the night had been still as the grave Now it fairly
vibrated with clangor All because one rookies nerves had been less
staunch than his courage and because that same rookie had not only had
his hand stepped on in the dark but had encountered something swirling
and hairy when he grabbed for the soldier who had stepped on him


The American lieutenant at the onset of the clamor sprang to his
feet whipping out his pistol his dry lips parted in a command to
chargea command which naturally would have reduced his eleven men
and himself to twelve corpses or to an equal number of mishandled
prisoners within the next few seconds But a big hand was clapped
unceremoniously across the young officers mouth silencing the
halfspoken suicidal order

Sergeant Mahans career in the regular army had given him an almost
uncanny power of sizing up his fellowmen And he had long ago decided
that this was the sort of thing his untried lieutenant would be likely
to do in just such an emergency Wherefore his flagrant breach of
discipline in shoving his palm across the mouth of his superior officer

And as he was committing this breach of discipline he heard the
Missourians strangled gasp of

Why didnt anybody ever tell me Germans was covered with fur

In a flash Mahan understood Wheeling he stooped low and flung out
both arms in a widesweeping circle Luckily his right hands
fingertips as they completed the circle touched something fastmoving
and furry

Bruce he whispered fiercely tightening his precarious grip on the
wisp of fur his fingers had touched Bruce Stand still boy Its YOU
whos got to get us clear of this Nobody else short of the good Lord
can do it

Bruce had had a pleasantly lazy day with his friends in the firstline
trenches There had been much good food and more petting And at last
comfortably tired of it all he had gone to sleep He had awakened in a
most friendly mood and a little hungry Wherefore he had sallied forth
in search of human companionship He found plenty of soldiers who were
more than willing to talk to him and make much of him But a little
farther ahead he saw his good friend Sergeant Mahan and others of
his acquaintances starting over the parapet on what promised to be a
jolly evening stroll

All dogs find it hard to resist the mysterious lure of a walk in human
companionship True the night was not an ideal one for a ramble and
the fog had a way of congealing wetly on Bruces shaggy coat Still a
damp coat was not enough of a discomfort to offset the joy of a stroll
with his friends So Bruce had followed the twelve men quietly into No
Mans Land falling decorously into step behind Mahan

It had not been much of a walk for speed or for fun For the humans
went ridiculously slowly and had an eccentric way of bunching
together every now and again and then of stringing out into a
shambling line Still it was a walk and therefore better than loafing
behind in the trenches And Bruce had kept his noiseless place at the
Sergeants heels

Thenlong before Mahan heard the approaching tramp of feetBruce
caught not only the sound but the scent of the German platoon The
scent at once told him that the strangers were not of his own army A
German soldier and an American soldierbecause of their difference in
diet as well as for certain other and more cogent reasonshave by no
means the same odor to a collies trained scent nor to that of other
breeds of wardogs Official records of dogsentinels prove that

Aliens were nearing Bruces friends And the dogs ruff began to stand
up But Mahan and the rest seemed in no way concerned in spirit
therebythough to the dogs understanding they must surely be aware
of the approach So Bruce gave no further sign of displeasure He was
out for a walk as a guest He was not on sentryduty

But when the nearest German was almost upon them and all twelve
Americans dropped to the ground the collie became interested once
more A German stepped on the hand of one of his newest friends And
the friend yelled in pain Whereat the German made as if to strike the
steppedon man

This was quite enough for loyal Bruce Without so much as a growl of
warning he jumped at the offender

Dog and man tumbled earthward together Then after an instant of flurry
and noise Bruce felt Mahans fingers on his shoulder and heard the
stark appeal of Mahans whispered voice Instantly the dog was a
professional soldier once morealertly obedient and resourceful

Catch hold my left arm Lieutenant Mahan was exhorting Close up
there boysevery mans hand grabbing tight to the shoulder of the man
on his left Pass the word And you Missouri hang onto the
Lieutenant Quick there And tread soft and tread fast and dont let
go whatever happens Not a sound out of any one Im leading the way
And Bruce is going to lead me

There was a scurrying scramble as the men groped for one another Mahan
tightened his hold on Bruces mane

Bruce he said very low but with a strength of appeal that was not
lost on the listening dog Bruce Camp Back to CAMP And keep QUIET
Back to camp boy CAMP

He had no need to repeat his command so often and so strenuously Bruce
was a trained courier The one word Camp was quite enough to tell
him what he was to do

Turning he faced the American lines and tried to break into a gallop
His scent and his knowledge of direction were all the guides he needed
A dog always relies on his nose first and his eyes last The fog was no
obstacle at all to the collie He understood the Sergeants order and
he set out at once to obey it

But at the very first step he was checked Mahan did not release that
feverishly tight hold on his mane but merely shifted to his collar

Bruce glanced back impatient at the delay But Mahan did not let go
Instead he said once more

CAMP boy

And Bruce understood he was expected to make his way to camp with
Mahan hanging on to his collar

Bruce did not enjoy this mode of locomotion It was inconvenient and
there seemed no sense in it but there were many things about this
strenuous wartrade that Bruce neither enjoyed nor comprehended yet
which he performed at command

So again he turned campward Mahan at his collar and an annoyingly
hindering tail of men stumbling silently on behind them All around
were the Germansbutting drunkenly through the blanketdense fog
swinging their rifles like flails shouting confused orders
occasionally firing Now and then two or more of them would collide and
would wrestle in blind fury thinking they had encountered an American

Impeded by their own sightlessly swarming numbers as much as by the
impenetrable darkness they sought the foe And but for Bruce they must
quickly have found what they sought Even in compact form the
Americans could not have had the sheer luck to dodge every scattered
contingent of Huns which starred the German end of No Mans Landmost
of them between the fugitives and the American lines

But Bruce was on dispatch duty It was his work to obey commands and to
get back to camp at once It was bad enough to be handicapped by
Mahans grasp on his collar He was not minded to suffer further delay
by running into any of the clumps of gesticulating and cabbagereeking
Germans between him and his goal So he steered clear of such groups
making several wide detours in order to do so Once or twice he stopped
short to let some of the Germans grope past him not six feet away
Again he veered sharply to the leftincreasing his pace and forcing
Mahan and the rest to increase theirsto avoid a squad of thirty men
who were quartering the field in close formation and who all but
jostled the dog as they strode sightlessly by An occasional rifleshot
spat forth its challenge From both trenchlines men were firing at a
venture A few of the bullets sang nastily close to the twelve huddled
men and their canine leader Once a German not three yards away
screamed aloud and fell sprawling and kicking as one such chance
bullet found him Above and behind sounded the plop of starshells
sent up by the enemy in futile hope of penetrating the viscid fog And
everywhere was heard the shuffle and stumbling of innumerable boots

At last the noise of feet began to die away and the uneven groping
tread of the twelve Americans to sound more distinctly for the
lessening of the surrounding turmoil And in another few seconds Bruce
came to a haltnot to an abrupt stop as when he had allowed an enemy
squad to pass in front of him but a leisurely checking of speed to
denote that he could go no farther with the load he was helping to haul

Mahan put out his free hand It encountered the American wires Bruce
had stopped at the spot where the party had cut a narrow path through
the entanglement on the outward journey Alone the dog could easily
have passed through the gap but he could not be certain of pulling
Mahan with him Wherefore the halt

     

The last of the twelve men scrambled down to safety in the American
firstline trench Bruce among them The lieutenant went straight to
his commanding officer to make his report Sergeant Mahan went
straight to his company cook whom he woke from a snoreful sleep
Presently Mahan ran back to where the soldiers were gathered admiringly
around Bruce

The Sergeant carried a chunk of fried beef for which he had just given
the cook his entire remaining stock of cigarettes

Here you are Bruce he exclaimed The best in the shop is none too
good for the dog that got us safe out of that filthy mess Eat hearty

Bruce did not so much as sniff at the more or less tempting bit of
meat Coldly he looked up at Mahan Then with sensitive ears laid flat
against his silken head in token of strong contempt he turned his
back on the Sergeant and walked away

Which was Bruces method of showing what he thought of a human fool who
would give him a command and who would then hold so tightly to him that
the dog could hardly carry out the order



CHAPTER V The Double Cross

In the background lay a landscape that had once been beautiful In the
middle distance rotted a village that had once been alive In the
foreground stood an edifice that had once been a church The
oncebeautiful landscape had the look of a gigantic pockmarked face so
scored was it by shellscar and crater Its vegetation was swept away
Its trees were shattered stumps Its farmsteads were charred piles of
rubble

The village was unlike the general landscape in that it had never been
beautiful In spite of globetrotters sentimental gush not all
villages of northern France were beautiful Many were built for thrift
and for comfort and for expediency not for architectural or natural
loveliness

But this village of MeranenLaye was not merely deprived of what
beauty it once might or might not have possessed Except by courtesy it
was no longer a village at all It was a double row of squalid ruins
zigzagging along the two sides of what was left of its main street
Here and there a cottage or tiny shop or shed was still habitable The
rest was debris

The church in the foreground was recognizable as such by the shape and
size of its ragged walls and by a halfsmashed image of the Virgin and
Child which slanted out at a perilous angle above its facade

Yet miserable as the ruined hamlet seemed to the casual eye it was at
present a vacationresortand a decidedly welcome oneto no less than
three thousand tired men The wrecked church was an impromptu hospital
beneath whose shattered roof dozens of these men lay helpless on
makeshift cots

For the mixed American and French regiment known as the HereWeComes
was billeted at MeranenLaye during a respite from the rigors and
perils of the frontline trenches

The rest and the freedom from risks supposed to be a part of the
billeting system were not wholly the portion of the HereWe Comes
MeranenLaye was just then a somewhat important little speck on the
warmap

The Germans had been up to their favorite field sport of trying to
split in half two of the Allied armies and to roll up each
independently The effort had been a failure yet it had come so near
to success that many railway communications were cut off or deflected
And MeranenLaye had for the moment gained new importance by virtue
of a spur railwayline which ran through its outskirts and which made
junction with a new set of tracks the American engineers were
completing Along this transverse of roads much ammunition and food and
many fighting men were daily rushed

The safety of the village had thus become of much significance While
it was too far behind the lines to be in grave danger of enemy raids
yet such danger existed to some extent Wherefore the presence of the
HereWeComesfor the paradoxical double purpose of resting up and
of guarding the railway Function

Still it was better than trenchwork and the HereWeComes enjoyed
itfor a day or so Then trouble had set in

A group of soldiers were lounging on the stone seat in front of the
village estaminet Being off duty they were reveling in that popular
martial pastime known to the Tommy as grousing and to the Yankee
doughboy as airing a grouch

TopSergeant Mahan formerly of the regular army was haranguing the
others Some listened approvingly others dissentingly and others not
at all

I tell you Mahan declared for the fourth time somebodys
doublecrossing us again Theres a leak And if they dont find out
where it is a whole lot of good men and a million dollars worth of
supplies are liable to spill out through that same leak It

But argued his crony old Sergeant Vivier in his hardlearned
English but it may all be of a chance mon vieux It may not be the
doubled crosswhatever a doubled cross meansbut the mere chance
Such things often

Chance my grandmothers walleyed cat snorted Mahan Maybe it
might have been chancewhen this place hadnt been bombed for a
monthfor a whole flight of boche artillery and airship grenades to
cut loose against it the day General Pershing happened to stop here for
an hour on his way to ChateauThierry Maybe that was chancethough I
know blamed well it wasnt Maybe it was chance that the place wasnt
bombed again till two days ago when that trooptrain had to spend such
a lot of time getting shunted at the junction Maybe it was chance that
the church over across the street hadnt been touched since the last
drive till our regiments wounded were put in itand that its been
hit three times since then Maybe any one of those thingsand of a
dozen others was chance But its a cinch that ALL of them werent
chance Chance doesnt work that way I

Perhaps doubtfully assented old Vivier perhaps But I little like
to believe it For it means a spy And a spy in ones midst is like to
a snake in ones blankets It is a not pleasing comrade And it stands
in sore need of killing

Theres spies everywhere averred Mahan Thats been proved often
enough So why not here But I wish to the Lord I could lay hands on
him If this was one of the little sheltered villages in a valley his
work would be harder And the boche airships and the longrangers
wouldnt find us such a simple target But up here on this ridge all a
spy has to do is to flash a signal any night that a boche airman can
pick up or that can even be seen with good glasses from some high point
where it can be relayed to the German lines The guy who laid out this
burg was sure thoughtless He might have known thered be a war some
day He might even have strained his mind and guessed that wed be
stuck here Gee

He broke off with a grunt of disgust nor did he so much as listen to
another of the group who sought to lure him into an opinion as to
whether the spy might be an inhabitant of the village or a
campfollower

Sucking at his pipe the Sergeant glowered moodily down the ruined
street The village drowsed under the hot midday Here and there a
soldier lounged along aimlessly or tried out his exercisebook French
on some puzzled native Now and then an officer passed in or out of
the halfunroofed mairie which served as regimental headquarters

Beyond in the handkerchiefsized village square a platoon was
drilling A thin French housewife was hanging sheets on a line behind a
shelltwisted hovel A Red Cross nurse came out of the hospitalchurch
across the street from the estaminet and seated herself on the stone
steps with a basketful of sewing

Mahans halfshut eyes rested critically on the drilling
platoonamusedly on the woman who was so carefully hanging the ragged
sheetsand then approvingly upon the Red Cross nurse on the church
steps across the way

Mahan like most other soldiers honored and revered the Red Cross for
its work of mercy in the army And the sight of one of the several
local nurses of the Order won from him a glance of real approbation

But presently into his weatherbeaten face came an expression of glad
welcome Out of the mairie gate and into the sleepy warmth of the
street lounged a huge darkbrownandwhite collie The don stretched
himself lazily fore and aft in true collie style then stood gazing
about him as if in search of something of interest to occupy his bored
attention

Hello observed Mahan breaking in on a homily of Viviers Theres
Bruce

Viviers leathery face brightened at sound of the collies name He
looked eagerly in the direction of Mahans pointing finger

Ce brave exclaimed the Frenchman I did not know even that he was
in the village It must be he is but newarriven Otherwise he would
of an assuredly have hunted up his old friends Ohe Bruce he called
invitingly

The big dog must have gotten here just a few minutes ago said
Sergeant Mahan He was coming out of headquarters when I saw him That
must mean hes just struck the town and with a message for the KO He
always goes like greased lightning when hes on dispatch duty till he
has delivered his message Then if hes to be allowed to hang around a
while before hes sent back he loafs lazylike the way you see him
now If all the courierdogs were like him every human courier would
be out of a job

At Viviers hail the great collie had pricked his ears and glanced
inquiringly up and down the street Catching sight of the group seated
in front of the estaminet he began to wag his plumy tail and set off
toward them at a trot

Ten minutes earlier Bruce had cantered into MeranenLaye from the
opposite end of the street bearing in his collar a dispatch from the
corps commander to the colonel of the HereWeComes The colonel at
the mairie had read the dispatch and had patted its bearer then had
bidden the dog lie down and rest if he chose after his long run

Instead Bruce had preferred to stroll out in search of friends

TopSergeant Mahan by the way would have felt highly flattered had he
chanced to get a glimpse of the dispatch Bruce had brought to the
colonel For it bore out Mahans own theory regarding the presence of
spies at or near the village and it bade the HereWeCome colonel
use every means for tracing them

It added the information that three trooptrains with nine engines were
to pass through the village that night on their way to the trenches
and that the trains were due at the junction at nine oclock or shortly
thereafter The mairie was on the other side of the street from the
estaminet Incidentally it was on the shady side of the streetfor
which reason Brucebeing wise and the day being hotremained on
that side until he should come opposite the bench where his friends
awaited him

His course thus brought him directly past the church

As he trotted by the steps the Red Cross nurse who sat sewing there
chirped timidly at him Bruce paused in his leisurely progress to see
who had accosted him whether an old acquaintance to be greeted as
such or merely a pleasantly inclined stranger

His soft brown eyes rested first in idle inquiry upon the angular and
whiterobed figure on the steps Then on the instant the friendly
inquiring look left his eyes and their softness went with itleaving
the dogs gaze cold and frankly hostile

One corner of Bruces lips slowly lifted revealing a tiny view of the
terrible white fangs behind them His gayly erect head was lowered and
in the depths of his furry throat a growl was born When a dog barks
and holds his head up there is little enough to fear from him But
when he lowers his head and growlthen look out

Mahan knew dogs In stark amazement he now noted Bruces strange
attitude toward the nurse Never before had he seen the dog show active
hostility toward a strangerleast of all toward a stranger who had in
no way molested him It was incredible that the wontedly dignified and
sweettempered collie had thus returned a greeting Especially from a
woman

Mahan had often seen Red Cross nurses stop to caress Bruce He had been
amused at the dogs almost protective cordiality toward all women
whether the French peasants or the wearers of the brassard of mercy

Toward menexcept those he had learned to look on as friendsthe
collie always comported himself with a courteous aloofness But he had
seemed to regard every woman as something to be humored and guarded and
to be treated with the same cordial friendliness that he bestowed on
their childrenwhich is the way of the best type of collie Yet Bruce
had actually snarled at this woman who had chirped to him from the
steps of the church And he showed every sign of following up the
challenge by still more drastic measures

Bruce called Mahan sharply BRUCE Shame Come over here Come
NOW

At the Sergeants vehement summons Bruce turned reluctantly away from
the foot of the church steps and came across the street toward the
estaminet He came slowly Midway he halted and looked back over his
shoulder at the nurse his fangs glinting once more in a snarl At a
second and more emphatic call from Mahan the dog continued his progress

The nurse had started back in alarm at the collies angry
demonstration Now gathering up her work she retreated into the
church

Im sorry Miss Mahan shouted after her I never saw him that way
before when a lady spoke to him If it was any dog but old Bruce Id
give him a whaling for acting like that to you Im deadsure he didnt
mean any harm

Oh I was going in anyway replied the nurse from the doorway It
is of no consequence

She spoke nervously her rich contralto voice shaken by the dogs
fierce show of enmity Then she vanished into the church and Mahan and
Vivier took turns in lecturing Bruce on his shameful dearth of courtesy

The big dog paid no heed at all to his friends discourse He was
staring sullenly at the doorway through which the nurse had gone

Thats one swell way for a decently bred dog to treat a woman Mahan
was telling him Least of all a Red Cross nurse Im clean ashamed of
you

Bruce did not listen In his heart he was still angryand very much
perplexed as well For he knew what these stupid humans did not seem to
know

HE KNEW THE RED CROSS NURSE WAS NO WOMAN AT ALL BUT A MAN

Bruce knew too that the nurse did not belong to his loved friends of
the Red Cross For his uncanny power of scent told him the garments
worn by the impostor belonged to some one else To mere humans a small
and slender man who can act and who dons womans garb is a woman To
any dog such a man is no more like a woman than a horse with a
lambskin saddlepad is a lamb He is merely a man who is differently
dressed from other meneven as this man who had chirped to Bruce from
the church steps was no less a man for the costume in which he had
swathed his body Any dog at a glance and at a sniff would have known
that

Women for one thing do not usually smoke dozens of rank cigars daily
for years until their flesh is permeated with the smell of tobacco A
human could not have detected such a smellsuch a MANsmellon the
person who had chirped to Bruce Any dog twenty feet away would have
noticed it and would have tabulated the whiteclad masquerader as a
man Nor do a womans hair and skin carry the faint but unmistakable
odor of barracks and of tentlife and of martial equipment as did this
mans The masquerader was evidently not only a man but a soldier

Dogshighstrung dogsdo not like to have tricks played on them
least of all by strangers Bruce seemed to take the nursedisguise as a
personal affront to himself Then too the man was not of his own
army On the contrary the scent proclaimed him one of the horde whom
Bruces friends so manifestly hatedone of the breed that had more
than once fired on the dog

Diet and equipment and other causes give a German soldier a markedly
different scent to dogs miraculously keen nostrilsand to those of
certain humansfrom the French or British or American troops War
records prove this Once having learned the scent and having learned
to detest it Bruce was not to be deceived

For all these reasons he had snarled loathingly at the man in white
For these same reasons he could not readily forget the incident but
continued every now and then to glance curiously across toward the
church

Presentlynot relishing the rebukes of the friends who had heretofore
pestered him by overmuch pettingthe collie arose quietly from his
couch of trampled earth at the foot of the stone bench and strolled
back across the street Most of the men were too busy talking to note
Bruces departure But Sergeant Mahan caught sight of him just as the
dog was mounting the last of the steps leading into the church

As a rule when Bruce went investigating he walked carelessly and with
his tail slightly awag Now his tail was stiff as an icicle and he
moved warily on the tips of his toes His tawnymaned neck was low
Mahan understanding dogs did not like the collies demeanor
Remembering that the nurse had entered the church a few minutes
earlier the Sergeant got to his feet and hastily followed Bruce

The dog meanwhile had passed through the crazily splintered doorway
and had paused on the threshold of the improvised hospital as the reek
of iodoform and of carbolic smote upon his sensitive nostrils In front
of him was the stonepaved vestibule Beyond was the interior of the
shattered church lined now with double rows of cots

Seated on a campchair in the shadowy vestibule was the pseudo Red
Cross nurse At sight of the collie the nurse got up in some haste
Bruce still walking stifflegged drew closer

Out from under the white skirt flashed a capable and solidlyshod foot
In a swinging kick the foot let drive at the oncoming dog Before
Bruce could dodge or could so much as guess what was comingthe kick
smote him with agonizing force square on the shoulder

To a spirited collie a kick carries more than the mere pain of its
inflicting It is a grossly unforgivable affront as wellas many a
tramp and thief have learned at high cost

By the time the kick had fairly landed Bruce had recovered from his
instant of incredulous surprise and with lightning swiftness he hurled
himself at his assailant

No bark or growl heralded the murderous throatlunge It was all the
more terrible for the noiselessness wherewith it was delivered The
masquerading man saw it coming just too late to guard against it He
lurched backward belatedly throwing both hands up to defend his
throat It was the involuntary backward step which saved his jugular
For his heel caught in the hem of his white skirt And wholly off
balance he pitched headlong to the floor

This jerky shift of position on the part of the foe spoiled Bruces
aim His fearful jaws snapped together harmlessly in empty air at a
spot where a fraction of a second earlier the others throat had
been Down crashed the disguised man And atop of him the furious dog
hurled himself seeking a second time the throatgrip he had so narrowly
missed

At this point on the program Sergeant Mahan arrived just in time to
bury both hands in the mass of Bruces furry ruff and to drag the
snarlingly rabid dog back from his prey

The place was in an uproar Nurses and doctors came rushing out into
the vestibule sick and wounded men sat up on their cots and eagerly
craned their necks to catch sight of the scrimmage Soldiers ran in
from the street

Strong as he was Mahan had both hands full in holding the frantic
Bruce back from his enemy Under the insult of the kick from this
masquerader whom he had already recognized as a foe the collie had
temporarily lost every vestige of his stately dignity He was for the
moment merely a wild beast seeking revenge for a brutal injury He
writhed and fought in Mahans grasp Never once did he seek to attack
the struggling man who held him But he strained every giant sinew to
get at the foe who had kicked him

The dogs opponent scrambled to his feet helped by a dozen willing
hands and accosted by as many solicitous voices The victims face was
bonegray with terror His lips twitched convulsively Yet as befitted
a person in his position he had a splendid set of nerves And almost
at once he recovered partial control over himself

II dont know how it happened he faltered his rich contralto
voice shaky with the groundswells of his recent shock It began when
I was sitting on the steps sewing This dog came past He growled at
me so threateningly that I came indoors A minute later while I was
sitting here sewing he sprang at me and threw me down I believe he
wouldwould have killed me the narrator finished with a very
genuine shudder if I had not been rescued when I was Such
bloodthirsty brutes ought to be shot

He not only OUGHT to be hotly agreed the chief surgeon but he is
GOING to be Take him out into the street one of you men and put a
ball in his head

The surgeon turned to the panting nurse

Youre certain he didnt hurt you he asked I dont want a
newcomer like yourself to think this is the usual treatment our
nurses get Lie down and rest You look scared to death And dont be
nervous about the cur attacking you again Hell be dead inside of
three minutes

The nurse with a mumbled word of thanks scuttled off into the rear of
the church where the tumbledown vestry had been fitted up as a
dormitory

Bruce had calmed down somewhat under Mahans sharp reproof But he now
struggled afresh to get at his vanished quarry And again the Sergeant
had a tussle to hold him

I dont know whats got into the big fellow exclaimed Mahan to
Vivier as the old Frenchman joined the tumultuous group Hes gone
clean daft Hed of killed that poor woman if I hadnt

Get him out of here ordered the surgeon And clear out yourselves
all of you This rumpus has probably set a lot of my patients
temperatures to rocketing Take the cur out and shoot him

Excuse me sir spoke up Mahan as Vivier stared aghast at the man
who commanded Bruces destruction but hes no cur Hes a
couriercollie officially in the service of the United States
Government And hes the best courierdog in France today This is

I dont care what he is raged the surgeon He

This is Bruce continued Mahan the dog that saved the
HereWeComes at Rache and that steered a detail of us to safety one
night in the fog in the ChateauThierry sector If you order any man
of the HereWeComes to shoot Bruce youre liable to have a mutiny
on your handsofficer or no officer But if you wish sir I can
transmit your order to the KO If he endorses it

But the surgeon sought at that moment to save the remnants of his
dignity and of a bad situation by stalking loftily back into the
hospital and leaving Mahan in the middle of his speech

Or sir the Sergeant grinningly called after him you might write
to the General Commanding and tell him you want Bruce shot The Big
Dog always sleeps in the generals own room when hes offduty at
Division Headquarters Maybe the general will OK his deathsentence
if you ask him to He

Somewhat quickening his stately stride the surgeon passed out of
earshot At the officers mess of the HereWeComes he had often
heard Bruces praises sung He had never chanced to see the dog until
now But beneath his armor of dignity he quaked to think what the
results to himself must have been had he obeyed his first impulse of
drawing his pistol and shooting the adored and pricelessly useful
collie

Mahanstolidly rejoicing in his victory over the toplofty potentate
whom he dislikedled the way out of the crowded vestibule into the
street Bruce followed demurely at his heels and Vivier bombarded
everybody in sight for information as to what the whole fracas was
about

Bruce was himself again Now that the detested man in womans clothes
had gone away there was no sense in continuing to struggle or to waste
energy in a show of fury Nevertheless in his big heart burned
deathless hatred toward the German who had kicked him And like an
elephant a collie never forgets

But Vivier was demanding of everybody but why should the gentle
Bruce have attacked a good nurse It is not what you call makesense
Cest un gentilhomme ce vieux He would not attack a woman less still
a sister of the Red Cross He

Of course he wouldnt glumly assented the downhearted Mahan But he
DID Thats the answer I saw him do it He knocked her down and

Which nurse was she asked a soldier who had come up after the
trouble was over

A new one here I dont know her name She came last week I saw her
when she got here I was on duty at the KOs office when she
reported She had a letter from some one on the surgeongenerals
staff But why Bruce should have gone for her todayor for any
womanis more than I can see She was scared half to death Its lucky
she heard the surgeon order him shot Shell suppose hes dead by now
And thatll cure her scare We must try to keep Bruce away from this
end of the street till he goes back to headquarters tomorrow

As a result Bruce was coaxed to Mahans companyshed and by dint of
foodgifts and petting was induced to spend most of the day there

At sunset Bruce tired of his dull surroundings Mahan had gone on duty
so had Vivier so had others of his friends The dog was bored and
lonely Also he had eaten much And a walk is good not only for
loneliness but for settling an overfull stomach Bruce decided to go
for a walk

Through the irregular street of the village he picked his way and on
toward the open country beyond A sentry or two snapped fingers of
greeting to him as he strolled past them The folk of the village eyed
his bulk and graceful dignity with something like awe

Beyond the hamlet the ridge of hilltop ran on for perhaps a
quartermile before dipping into the plain below At one end of this
little plateau a company of infantry was drilling Bruce recognized
Mahan among the marching lines but he saw his friend was on duty and
refrained from going up to him

Above the sunset sky was cloudless Like tiny specks miles to
eastward a few enemy airships circled above the heap of clustered
hills which marked the nearest German position The tornup plain
between seemed barren of life So at first did the farther end of
the jutting ridge on which the village was perched But presently
Bruces idly wandering eye was caught by a flutter of white among some
boulders that clumped together on the ridges brow farthest from the
village

Some onea woman from the dresswas apparently picking her way
through the boulders As Bruce moved forward a big rock shut her off
from his view and from the view of the hamlet and of the maneuvering
infantry company a furlong away

Just then a puff of breeze blew from eastward toward the collie and it
bore to him a faint scent that set his ruff abristle and his soft
brown eyes ablaze To a dog a scent once smelled is as recognizable
again as is the sight of a onceseen face to a human Bruce set off at
a handgallop toward the clump of boulders

The Red Cross nurse whom Bruce had so nearly killed was off duty
until the nightshift should go on at the hospital The nurse had taken
advantage of this brief surcease from toil by going for a little walk
in the cool sunset air and had carried along a bag of sewing

Up to three months ago this nurse had been known as Heinrich Stolz and
had been a valued member of the Wilhelmstrasses workingforce of secret
agents Then acting under orders Herr Heinrich Stolz had vanished
from his accustomed haunts Soon thereafter a Red Cross nurseFelicia
Stuart by name had reported for duty at Paris having been transferred
thither from Italy and bearing indubitable credentials to that effect

From carefully pickedup information Stolz had just learned of the
expected arrival of the three trooptrains at the junction at nine that
evening The tidings had interested him keenly and he knew of other
people to whom they would be far more interesting

Seating himself under the lee of the easternmost rock Stolz primly
opened his sewingbag and drew forth various torn garments The
garments were for the most part white but one or two were of gaudy
colors

By way of precaution in case of discovery the spy threaded a needle
Thus if any one should chance to see him shake out a garment
preparatory to laying it on his knee and mending it there could be no
reasonable cause for suspicion Herr Stolz was nothing if not efficient

He held up the needle and poked the thread at its eye in truly feminine
fashion

He had just finished this feat of dexterity when he chanced to look up
from his work at sound of fastpattering feet Not thirty feet away
charging head on at him rushed the great brownandwhite collie he
supposed had been shot

With a jump of abject terror Herr Stolz sprang up Mingled with his
normal fear of the dog was a tinge of superstitious dread He had been
so certain the beast was shot The doctor had given the order for his
killing The doctor was a commissioned officer Stolzs German mind
could not grasp the possibility of a soldier disobeying an officers
imperative command

The collie was upon him by the time the spy gained his feet Stolz
reached frantically under his dressfolds for the deadly little pistol
that he always kept there But he was still a novice in the mysteries
of feminine apparel And before his fingers could close on the weapon
Bruces bared fangs were gleaming at his throat

Stolz ceased to search for the weapon And as before he threw up both
frantic hands to ward off the furious jaws

He was barely in time Bruces white teeth drove deep into the spys
forearm and Bruces eighty pounds of furry muscular bulk smote Stolz
full in the chest Down went the spy under the terrific impact
sprawling wildly on his back and fighting with both bleeding hands to
push back the dog

Bruce colliefashion did not stick to one grip but bit and slashed a
dozen times in three seconds tearing and rending his way toward the
throathold he craved driving through flesh of hands and of forearms
toward his goal

Like many another German Stolz was far more adept at causing pain than
at enduring it Also from birth he had had an unconquerable fear of
dogs His nerves too were not yet recovered from Bruces attack
earlier in the day All this and the spectral suddenness of the
onslaught robbed him of every atom of his usual stony selfcontrol

Sergeant Mahan was a good soldier Yet a minute earlier he had almost
ruined his reputation as such He had been hard put to it to refrain
from leaving the ranks of his drilling company a furlong from the
rocks and running at record speed toward the boulders For he had seen
the supposed nurse pass that way And almost directly afterward he had
seen Bruce follow her thither And he could guess what would happen

Luckily for the sake of discipline the order of Break ranks was
given before Mahan could disgrace himself by such unmartial behavior
And on the instant the Sergeant broke into a run in the direction of
the rocks

Wondering at his eccentric action several of the soldiers followed
The company captain at sight of a knot of his men dashing at breakneck
speed toward the boulders started at a more leisurely pace in the same
direction

Mahan had reached the edge of the rocks when his ears were greeted by a
yell of mortal fear The captain and the rest catching the sound went
faster Screech after screech rang from the rocky enclosure

Mahan rounded the big boulder at the crest of the ridge and flung
himself upon the two combatants as they thrashed about in a tumultuous
dual mass on the ground And just then Bruce at last found his grip on
Stolzs throat

A stoical German signalcorps officer on a hilltop some miles to
eastward laid aside his fieldglass and calmly remarked to a man at
his side

We have lost a good spy

Such was the sole epitaph and eulogy of Herr Heinrich Stolz from his
army

Meantime Sergeant Mahan was prying loose the collies ferocious jaws
from their prey and was tugging with all his might to drag the dog off
the shrieking spy The throathold he noted was a bare inch from the
jugular

The rest of the soldiers rushing up pellmell helped him pull the
infuriated Bruce from his victim The spectacle of their admired
doghero so murderously mauling a woman of the Red Cross dazed them
with horror

Take him AWAY bellowed Stolz delirious with pain and fear Hes
KILLED meder gottverdammte Teufelhund

And now the crazed victims unconscious use of German was not needed to
tell every one within hearing just who and what he was For the
quavering tones were no longer a rich contralto They were a throaty
baritone And the accent was Teutonic

Bruce observed TopSergeant Mahan next morning Ive always said a
man who kicks a dog is more of a cur than the dog is But youll never
know how near I came to kicking you yesterday when I caught you
mangling that filthy spy And Brucie if I had kicked you wellId be
praying at this minute that the good Lord would grow a third leg on me
so that I could kick myself all the way from here to Berlin



CHAPTER VI The Werewolf

When Bruce left the quiet peace of The Place for the hell of the
Western Front it had been stipulated by the Mistress and the Master
that if ever he were disabled he should be shipped back to The Place
at their expense

It was a stipulation made rather to soothe the Mistresss sorrow at
parting from her loved pet than in any hope that it could be fulfilled
for the average life of a courierdog on the battlefront was tragically
short And his fate was more than ordinarily certain If the boche
bullets and shrapnel happened to miss him there were countless
diseasesbred of trench and of hardship and of abominable foodto
kill him

The Red Cross appeal raised countless millions of dollars and brought
rescue to innumerable human warriors But in caring for humans the
generosity of most givers reached its limit and the Blue Crossfor
the relief of dogs and horses injured in the service of the
Allieswas forced to take what it could get Yet many a man and many
a body of men owed life and safety to the heroism of some wardog a
dog which surely merited special care when its own certain hour of
agony struck

Bruces warmest overseas friends were to be found in the ranks of the
mixed FrancoAmerican regiment nicknamed the HereWeComes Right
gallantly in more than one tight place had Bruce been of use to the
HereWeComes On his official visits to the regiment he was always
received with a joyous welcome that would have turned any head less
steady than a thoroughbred collies

Bruce enjoyed this treatment He enjoyed too the fooddainties
wherewith the HereWeComes plied him But to no man in the army
would he give the adoring personal loyalty he had left at The Place
with the Mistress and the Master Those two were still his only gods
And he missed them and his sweet life at The Place most bitterly Yet
he was too good a soldier to mope

     

For months the HereWeComes had been quartered in a quietor only
occasionally tumultuoussector near ChateauThierry Then the
comparative quiet all at once turned to pandemonium

A lanky and degenerate youth who before the war had been unlovingly
known throughout Europe as the White Rabbit and who now was mentioned
in dispatches as the Crown Prince had succeeded in leading some
halfmillion fellowGermans into a pocket that had lately been merely
a salient

From the three lower sides of the pocket the Allies ecstatically flung
themselves upon their trapped foes in a laudable effort to crush the
halfmillion boches and their rabbitfaced princeling into surrender
before the latter could get out of the snare and to the shelter of the
high ground and the reenforcements that lay behind it The Germans
objected most strenuously to this crushing process And the three
beleaguered edges of the pocket became a triplesection of hell

It was a period when no ones nerves were in any degree normalleast
of all the nerves of the eternally hammered Germans Even the fiercely
advancing FrancoAmericans the HereWeComes had lost the grimly
humorous composure that had been theirs and waxed sullen and ferocious
in their eagerness

Thus it was that Bruce missed his wontedly uproarious welcome as he
cantered at sunset one July day into a smashed farmstead where his
friends the HereWeComes were bivouacked for the night By
instinct the big dog seemed to know where to find the temporary
regimental headquarters

He trotted past a sentry into an unroofed cattleshed where the
colonel was busily scribbling a detailed report of the work done by the
HereWeComes during that days drive

Coming to a halt by the colonels side Bruce stood expectantly wagging
his plumy tail and waiting for the folded message from division
headquarters to be taken off his collar

Usually on such visits the colonel made much of the dog Today he
merely glanced up abstractedly from his writing at sight of Bruces
silken head at his side He unfastened the message read it frowned
and went on with his report

Bruce continued to wag his tail and to look up wistfully for the wonted
petting and word of commendation But the colonel had forgotten his
existence So presently the collie wearied of waiting for a caress from
a man whose caresses at best he did not greatly value He turned and
strolled out of the shed His message delivered he knew he was at
liberty to amuse himself as he might choose to until such time as he
must carry back to his general a reply to the dispatch he had brought

From outside came the voices of tired and lounging soldiers A
traveling kitchen had just been set up near by From it arose a blend
of smells that were mighty tempting to a healthily hungry dog Thither
at a decorous but expectant pace Bruce bent his steps

TopSergeant Mahan was gazing with solicitous interest upon the toil of
the cooks at the wheeled kitchen Beside him sharing his concern in
the supper preparations was Mahans closest crony old Sergeant
Vivier The wizened little Frenchman as a boy had been in the
surrender of Sedan Nightly ever since he had besought the saints to
give him some day a tiny share in the avenging of that black disgrace

Mahan and Vivier were the warmest of Bruces many admirers in the
HereWeComes Ordinarily a dual whoop of joy from them would have
greeted his advent This afternoon they merely chirped abstractedly at
him and Mahan patted him carelessly on the head before returning to
the inspection of the cooking food

Since an hour before dawn both men had been in hot action The command
for the HereWeComes to turn aside and bivouac for the night had
been a sharp disappointment to them as well as to every unwounded man
in the regiment

When a gambler is in the middle of a winning streak when an athlete
feels he has the race in his own hands when a business man has all but
closed the deal that means fortune to himat such crises it is
maddening to be halted at the very verge of triumph But to soldiers
who after months of reverses at last have their hated foe on the run
such a check does odd things to temper and to nerves

In such plight were the men of the HereWeComes on this late
afternoon Mahan and Vivier were too seasoned and too sane to give way
to the bursts of temper and the swirls of blasphemy that swayed so many
of their comrades Nevertheless they were glum and silent and had no
heart for jolly welcomingseven to so dear a friend as Bruce

Experience told them that a square meal would work miracles in the way
of calming and bracing them Hence apart from stark hunger their
interest in the cooking of supper

Bruce was too much a philosopherand not devoted enough to his soldier
friendsto be hurt at the lack of warmth in the greeting With the air
of an epicure he sniffed at the contents of one of the kitchens
bubbling kettles Then he walked off and curled himself comfortably on
a pile of bedding there to rest until supper should be ready

Several times as he lay there soldiers passed and repassed One or
two of them snapped their fingers at the dog or even stooped in
passing to stroke his head But on the faces of all of them was unrest
and a certain wolfish eagerness which precluded playing with pets at
such a time The hot zest of the manhunt was upon them It was gnawing
in the veins of the newest recruit ever as in the heart of the
usually selfcontained colonel of the regiment

The colonel in fact had been so carried away by the joy of seeing his
men drive the hated graycoats before them that day that he had
overstepped the spirit of his own orders from the division commander

In brief he had made no effort to dress his command in the advance
upon the regiments to either side of it As a result when the signal
to bivouac for the night was given the HereWeComes were something
like a mile ahead of the regiment which should have been at their
immediate right and nearly two miles in front of the brigade at their
left

In other words the HereWeComes now occupied a salient of their
own ahead of the rest of the FrancoAmerican line It was in rebuke for
this bit of good progress and bad tactics that the division commander
had written to the colonel in the dispatch which Bruce had brought

German airmen sailing far above and dodging as best they could the
charges of the Allied planes had just noted that the HereWeComes
salient was really no salient at all So far had it advanced that
for the moment it was out of touch with the rest of the division It
was indeed in an excellent position to be cut off and demolished by a
dashing nightattack And a report to this effect was delivered to a
fumingly distracted German major general who yearned for a chance to
atone in some way for the days shameful reverses

If they hadnt halted us and made us call it a day just as we were
getting into our stride loudly grumbled one Yankee private to another
as the two clumped up to the kitchen wed have been in
FereenTardenois by now What lazy guy is running this drive anyhow

The same lazy guy that will stick you into the hoosgow for
insubordination and leave you to do your bit there while the rest of us
stroll on to Berlin snapped TopSergeant Mahan wheeling upon the
grumbler Till you learn how to obey orders without grouching it
isnt up to you to knock wiser men Shut up

Though Mahans tone of reproof was professionally harsh his spirit was
not in his words And the silenced private knew it He knew too that
the topsergeant was as savage over the early halt as were the rest of
the men

Bruce as a rule when he honored the HereWeComes with a visit
spent the bulk of his time with Mahan and old Vivier But today
neither of these friends was an inspiring companion Nor were the rest
of Bruces acquaintances disposed to friendliness Wherefore as soon
as supper was eaten the dog returned to his heap of bedding for the
hour or so of laziness which Nature teaches all her children to demand
after a full mealand which the socalled dumb animals alone are
intelligent enough to take

Dusk had merged into night when Bruce got to his feet again Taps had
just sounded The tired men gladly rolled themselves into their
blankets and fell into a dead sleep A sentryrelief set forth to
replace the first batch of sentinels with the second

Mahan was of the party Though the topsergeant had been a stupid
comrade thus far today he was now evidently going for a walk And
even though it was a dutywalk yet the idea of it appealed to the dog
after his long inaction

So Bruce got up and followed As he came alongside the stiffly marching
topsergeant the collie so far subverted discipline as to thrust his
nose in friendly greeting into Mahans slightly cupped palm And the
topsergeant so far abetted the breach of discipline as to give the
collies head a furtive pat The night was dim as the moon had not
risen so the mutual contact of goodfellowship was not visible to the
marching men on either side of Mahan and the dog And discipline
therefore did not suffer much after all

At one post after another a sentinel was relieved and a fresh man took
his place Farthest in front of the HereWeComes linesand nearest
to the Germanwas posted a lanky Missourian whom Bruce liked a man
who had a way of discovering in his deep pockets stray bits of food
which he had hoarded there for the collie and delighted to dole out to
him The Missourian had a drawlingly soft voice the dog liked and he
used to talk to Bruce as if the latter were another human

For all these reasonsand because Mahan was too busy and too grumpy to
bother with himBruce elected to stay where he was for a while and
share the Missourians vigil So when the rest of the party moved
along to the next sentrygo the dog remained The Missourian was only
too glad to have him do so It is tedious and stupid to pace a desolate
beat alone at dead of night after a day of hard fighting And the
man welcomed the companionship of the dog

For a time as the Missourian paced his solitary stretch of broken and
shrubgrown ground Bruce gravely paced to and fro at his side But
presently this aimless promenade began to wax uninteresting And as
the two came to the far end of the beat Bruce yawned and lay down It
was pleasanter to lie there and to watch the sentinel do the walking

Stretched out in a little grasshollow the dog followed blinkingly
with his soft brown eyes the pendulumlike progress of his friend And
always the dogs plumed tail would beat rhythmic welcome against the
ground as the sentry approached him

Thus nearly an hour wore on A fat moon butted its lazy way through the
smokemists of the eastern skyline

Then something happenedsomething that Bruce could readily have
forestalled if the wind had been blowing from the other direction and
if a dogs eyes were not as nearsighted as his nose is farsmelling

The Missourian paused to run his hand caressingly over the collies
rough mane and moved on down the lonely beat Bruce watched his
receding figure drowsily At the end of ninety yards or more the
Missourian passed by a bunch of low bushes which grew at the near side
of a stretch of hilly and shellpocked ground He moved past the bushes
still watched by the somewhat bored dog

It was then that Bruce saw a patch of bushshadow detach itself from the
rest under the glow of the rising moon The shadow was humpy and
squat Noiseless it glided out from among the bushes close at the
sentrys heels and crept after him

Bruce pricked his ears and started to get up His curiosity was roused
The direction of the wind prevented him from smelling out the nature of
the mystery It also kept his keen hearing from supplying any clue And
the distance would not permit him to see with any distinctness

Still his curiosity was very mild Surely if danger threatened the
sentinel would realize it For by this time the Shadow was a bare three
feet behind him near enough by Bruces system of logic for the
Missourian to have smelled and heard the pursuer So Bruce got up in
the most leisurely fashion preparatory to strolling across to
investigate But at almost his first step he saw something that changed
his gracefully slouching walk into a charging run

The Shadow suddenly had merged with the sentinel For an instant in
stark silence the two seemed to cling together Then the Shadow fled
and the lanky Missourian slumped to the earth in a sprawling heap his
throat cut

The slayer had been a deft hand at the job No sound had escaped the
Missourian from the moment the stranglingly tight left arm had been
thrown around his throat from behind until a second later he fell
bleeding and lifeless

In twenty leaping strides Bruce came up to the slain sentinel and bent
over him Doginstinct told the collie his friend had been done to
death And the dogs power of scent told him it was a German who had
done the killing

For many months Bruce had been familiar with the scent of German
soldiers so different from that of the army in which he toiled And he
had learned to hate it even as a dog hates the vague crushed
cucumber smell of a pitviper But while every dog dreads the
vipersmell as much as he loathes it Bruce had no fear at all of the
boche odor Instead it always awoke in him a bloodlust as fierce as
any that had burned in his wolfancestors

This same fury swept him now as he stood quivering above the body of
the kindly man who so lately had petted him this and a craving to
revenge the murder of his human friend

For the briefest time Bruce stood there his dark eyes abrim with
unhappiness and bewilderment as he gazed down on the huddled form in
the wet grass Then an electric change came over him The softness fled
from his eyes leaving them bloodshot and blazing His great tawny ruff
bristled like an angry cats The lazy gracefulness departed from his
mighty body It became tense and terrible In the growing moonlight his
teeth gleamed whitely from under his upcurled lip

In a flash he turned and set off at a loping run nose close to ground
his long stride deceptively swift The zest of the manhunt had
obsessed him as completely as that day it had spurred the advance of
the HereWeComes

The trail of the slayer was fresh even over such broken ground Fast
as the German had fled Bruce was flying faster Despite the murderers
long start the dog speedily cut down the distance between his quarry
and himself Not trusting to sight but solely to his unerring sense of
smell Bruce sped on

Then in a moment or two his hearing reenforced his scent He could
catch the padpadpad of running feet And the increasing of the sound
told him he was gaining fast

But in another bound his ears told him something elsesomething he
would have heard much sooner had not the night wind been setting so
strongly in the other direction He heard not only the pounding of his
preys heavyshod feet but the soft thud of hundredsperhaps
thousandsof other army shoes And now despite the adverse wind the
odor of innumerable soldiers came to his fiercely sniffing nostrils
Not only was it the scent of soldiers but of German soldiers

For the first time Bruce lifted his head from the ground as he ran
and peered in front of him The moon had risen above the lowlying
horizon vapors into a clear sky and the reach of country was sharply
visible

Bruce saw the man he was chasingsaw him plainly The German was
still running but not at all as one who flees from peril He ran
rather as might the bearer of glad tidings And he was even now
drawing up to a group of men who awaited eagerly his coming There must
have been fifty men in the group Behind themin open formation and as
far as the dogs nearsighted eyes could seewere more men and more
and morethousands of them all moving stealthily forward

Now a collie in brain though never in heart is much more wolf than
dog A bullterrier or an Airedale would have charged on at his foe
and would have let himself be hacked to pieces before loosing his hold
on the man

Buteven as a wolf checks his pursuit of a galloping sheep when the
latter dashes into the guarded foldBruce came to an abrupt halt at
sight of these reenforcements He stood irresolute still mad with
vengeful anger but not foolish enough to assail a whole brigade of
armed men

It is quite impossible though Mahan and Vivier used to swear it must
be true that Bruce had the reasoning powers to figure out the whole
situation which confronted him He could not have known that a German
brigade had been sent to take advantage of the HereWeComes
temporarily isolated positionthat three sentries had been killed in
silence and that their deaths had left a wide gap through which the
brigade hoped to creep unobserved until they should be within striking
distance of their unsuspectingly slumbering victims

Bruce could not have known this He could not have grasped the
slightest fraction of the idea being only a reallife dog and not a
fairytale animal But what he could and did realize was that a mass of
detested Germans was moving toward him and that he could not hope to
attack them singlehanded also that he was not minded to slink
peacefully away and leave his friend unavenged

Thwarted rage dragged from his furry throat a deep growl a growl that
resounded eerily through that silent place of stealthy moves And he
stepped majestically forth from the surrounding long grass into the
full glare of moonlight

The deceptive glow made him loom gigantic and black and tinged his
snowy chest with the phosphorous gleam of a snowfield His eyes shone
like a wild beasts

     

Corporal Rudolph Freund of the Konigin Luise Regiment had just
finished his threeword report to his superior He had merely saluted
and announced

He is dead

Corporal Freund did not thrill as usual to the colonels grunt of
approval The Corporal was worried He was a Black Forest peasant and
while iron military life had dulled his native superstitions it had
not dispelled them

The night was mystic in its odd blend of moon and shadows However
hardened one may be it is a nervestrain to creep through long grass
like a red Indian to the murder of a hostile sentinel And every
German in the Pocket had been under frightful mental and physical
stress for the past week

Corporal Rudolph Freund was a brave man and a brute But that week had
sapped his nerve And the work of this night had been the climax The
desolate ground over which he had crawled to the killing had suddenly
seemed peopled with evil gnomes and goblins whose existence no true
Black Forest peasant can doubt And on the run back he had been
certain he heard some unseen monster tearing through the underbrush in
hot pursuit of him So certain had he been that he had redoubled his
speed

There were no wolves or other large wild animals in that region When
he had wriggled toward the slowpacing American sentinel he had seen
and heard no creature of any sort Yet he was sure that on the way back
he had been pursued byby Something And into his scared memory as he
ran had flashed the ofttold Black Forest tale of the Werewolfthe
devilbeast that is entered by the soul of a murdered man and which
tracks the murderer to his death

Glad was the unnerved Corporal Freund when his run ceased and he stood
close to his grossly solid and rankscented fellowmen once more Almost
he was inclined to laugh at his fears of the fabled Werewolfand
especially at the idea that he had been pursued He drew a long breath
of relief He drew the breath in But he did not at once expel it For
on his ears came the sound of a hideous menacing growl

Corporal Freund spun about in the direction of the mysterious threat
And there not thirty feet from him in the ghostly moonlight stood
the Werewolf

This time there could be no question of overstrained nerves and of
imagination The Thing was THERE

Horribly visible in every detail the Werewolf was glaring at him He
could see the red glow of the gigantic devilbeasts eyes the white
flash of its teeth the ghostly shimmering of its snowy chest The soul
of the man he had slain had taken this traditional form and was hunting
down the slayer A thousand stories of Freunds childhood verified the
frightful truth And overwrought human natures endurance went to
pieces under the shock

A maniac howl of terror split the midnight stillness Shriek after
shriek rent the air Freund tumbled convulsively to the ground at his
colonels feet gripping the officers booted knees and screeching for
protection The colonel raging that the surprise attack should be
imperiled by such a racket beat the frantic man over the mouth with
his heavy fist kicking ferociously at his upturned writhing face and
snarling to him to be silent

The shower of blows brought Freund back to sanity to the extent of
changing his craven terror into Fears secondary phasethe impulse to
strike back at the thing that had caused the fright Rolling over and
over on the ground under the impact of his superiors fist blows and
kicks Freund somehow regained his feet

Reeling up to the nearest soldier the paniccrazed corporal snatched
the privates rifle and fired three times blindly at Bruce Then
foaming at the mouth Freund fell heavily to earth again chattering
and twitching in a fit

Bruce at the second shot leaped high in the air and collapsed in an
inert furry heap among the bushes There he layhis career as a
courierdog forever ended

Corporal Rudolph Freund was perhaps the best sniper in his regiment
Wildly though he had fired marksmaninstinct had guided his bullets
And at such close range there was no missing Bruce went to earth with
one rifle ball through his body and another in his leg A third had
reached his skull

Now the complete element of surprise was allneedful for the attack
the Germans had planned against the HereWeComes Deprived of that
advantage the expedition was doomed to utter failure For given a
chance to wake and to rally the regiment could not possibly be
rushed in vivid moonlight before the nearest Allied forces could
move up to its support And those forces were only a mile or so to the
rear There can be no possible hope for a surprise attack upon a
wellappointed camp when the nights stillness has been shattered by a
series of maniac screams and by three echoing rifleshots

Already the guard was out A bugle was blowing In another minute the
sentrycalls would locate the gap made by the three murdered sentinels

A swift guttural conference among the leaders of the grayclad
marauders was followed by the barking of equally guttural commands And
the Germans withdrew as quietly and as rapidly as they had come

     

It was the mouthing and jabbering of the fitpossessed Corporal Rudolph
Freund that drew to him the notice of a squad of Yankees led by
TopSergeant Mahan ten minutes later It was the shudderaccompanied
pointing of the delirious mans finger toward the nearby clump of
undergrowth that revealed to them the still warm body of Bruce

Back to camp carried lovingly in Mahans strong arms went all that
was left of the great courierdog Back to camp propelled between two
nonetoogentle soldiers staggered the fitridden Corporal Freund

At the colonels quarters a compelling dose of stimulant cleared some
of the mists from the prisoners brain His nerve and his willpower
still gone to smash he babbled eagerly enough of the night attack of
the killing of the sentries and of his encounter with the Werewolf

I saw him fall he raved But he is not dead The Werewolf can be
killed only by a silver bullet marked with a cross and blessed by a
priest He will live to track me down Lock me where he cannot find me
for the sake of sweet mercy

And in this way the HereWeComes learned of Bruces part in the
nights averted disaster

Old Vivier wept unashamed over the body of the dog he had loved
TopSergeant Mahanthe big tears splashing unnoted from his own red
eyesbesought the Frenchman to strive for better selfcontrol and not
to set a crybaby example to the men

Then a group of grimfaced soldiers dug a grave And carried by Mahan
and Vivier the beautiful dogs body was borne to its restingplace A
throng of men in the gray dawn stood wordless around the grave Some
one shamefacedly took off his hat With equal shamefacedness everybody
else followed the example

Mahan laid the dogs body on the ground at the graves brink Then
looking about him he cleared his throat noisily and spoke

Boys he began when a human dies for other humans theres a
Christian burial service read over him Id have asked the chaplain to
read one over Bruce here if I hadnt known hed say no But the Big
Dog isnt going to rest without a word said over his grave for all
that

Mahan cleared his throat noisily once more winked fast then went on

You can laugh at me if any of you feel like it But theres some of
you here who wouldnt be alive to laugh if Bruce hadnt done what he
did last night He was only just a dogwith no soul and with no life
after this one I spose So he went ahead and did his work and took
the risks and asked no pay

And by and by he died still doing his work and asking no pay

He didnt work with the idea of getting a cross or a ribbon or a
promotion or a pension or his name in the paper or to make the crowd
cheer him when he got back home or to brag to the homefolks about how
he was a hero He just went ahead and WAS a hero Thats because he was
only a dog with no souland not a man

All of us humans are working for some reward even if its only for
our pay or for the fun of doing our share But Bruce was a hero because
he was just a dog and because he didnt know enough to be anything
else but a hero

Ive heard about him before he joined up with us I guess most of us
have He lived up in Jersey somewhere With folks that had bred him
Ill bet a years pay he was made a lot of by those folks and that it
wrenched em to let him go You could see hed been brought up that
way Life must a been pretty happy for the old chap back there Then
he was picked up and slung into the middle of this hell

So was the rest of us says you But youre wrong Those of us that
waited for the draft had our choice of going to the hoosgow as
conscientious objectors if we didnt want to fight And every
mothers son of us knew we was fighting for the Right and that we was
making the world a decenter and safer place for our grandchildren and
our womenfolks to live in We didnt brag about God being on our side
like the boches do It was enough for us to know WE was on GODS side
and fighting His great fight for Him We had patriotism and religion
and Right behind us to give us strength

Brucie hadnt a one of those things He didnt know what he was here
forand why hed been pitched out of his nice home into all this He
didnt have a chance to say Yes or No He didnt have any spellbinders
to tell him he was making the world safe for dmocracy He was MADE to
come

How would any of us humans have acted if a deal like that had been
handed to us Wed a grouched and slacked and maybe deserted Thats
because were lords of creation and have souls and brains and such
What did Bruce do He jumped into this game with bells on He risked
his life a hundred times and he was just as ready to risk it again the
next day

Yes and he knew he was risking it too Theres blame little he
didnt know He saw wardogs all around him choking to death from
gas or screaming their lives out in No Mans Land when a bit of
shell had disemboweled em or a bullet had cracked their backbones He
saw em starve to death He saw em one bloody mass of scars and sores
He saw em die of pneumonia and mange and every rotten trench disease
And he knew it might be his turn any time at all to die as they were
dying and he knew the humans was too busy nursing other humans to
have time to spare on caring for tortured dogs Though those same dogs
were dying for the humans if it comes to that

Yes Bruce knew what the end was bound to be He knew it And he kept
on as gay and as brave as if he was on a days romp He never
flinched Not even that time the KO sent him up the hill for
reenforcements at Rache when every sharpshooter in the boche trenches
was laying for him and when the machine guns were trained on him too
Bruce knew he was running into death then and a dozen other times
And he went at it like a white man

ImIm getting longwinded And Ill stop Butmaybe if you boys
will remember the Big Dogand what he did for uswhen you get back
homeif youll remember him and what he did and what thousands of
other wardogs have donethen maybe youll be men enough to punch the
jaw of any guy who gets to saying that dogs are nuisances and that
vivisections a good thing and all that If youll just do that much
thenwell then Bruce hasnt lived and died for nothing

Brucie old boy bending to lift the tawny body and lower it into the
grave its goodby Its goodby to the cleanest whitest pal that a
poor dub of a doughboy ever had I

Mahan glowered across at the clump of silent men

If anybody thinks Im crying he continued thickly hes a liar I
got a cold and

Sacre bon Dieu yelled old Vivier insanely Regardedonc Nom dune
pipe

He knelt quickly beside the body in an ecstasy of excitement The
others craned their necks to see Then from a hundred throats went up a
gasp of amazement

Bruce slowly and dazedly was lifting his magnificent head

Chase off for the surgeon bellowed Mahan plumping down on his knees
beside Vivier and examining the wound in the dogs scalp The bullet
only creased his skull It didnt go through Its just put him out for
a few hours like Ive seen it do to men Get the surgeon If that
bullet in his body didnt hit something vital well pull him around
yet GLORY BE

     

It was late summer again at The Place late opulent summer with the
peace of green earth and blue sky the heavy droning of bees and the
promise of harvest The long shadows of late afternoon stretched
lovingly across the lawn from the great lakeside trees Over
everything brooded a dreamy amber light The war seemed a million miles
away

The Mistress and the Master came down from the vineshaded veranda for
their sunset walk through the grounds At sound of their steps on the
gravel a huge darkbrownandwhite collie emerged from his
restingplace under the wistariaarbor

He stretched himself lazily fore and aft in colliefashion Then he
trotted up to his two deities and thrust his muzzle playfully into the
Mistresss palm as he fell into step with the promenaders

He walked with a stiffness in one foreleg His gait was not a limp But
the legs strength could no longer be relied on for a tenmile gallop
Along his forehead was a newhealed bulletcrease And the fur on his
sides had scarcely yet grown over the mark of the highpowered ball
which had gone clear through him without touching a mortal spot

Truly the regimental surgeon of the HereWeComes had done a job
worthy of his own high fame And the dogs wonderful condition had done
the rest

Apart from scars and stiffness Bruce was none the worse for his year
on the battlefront He could serve no longer as a dashing courier But
his life as a pet was in no way impaired

Heres something that came by the afternoon mail Bruce the Master
greeted him as the collie ranged alongside It belongs to you Take a
look at it

The Master drew from his pocket a leather box and opened it On the
oblong of white satin within the cover was pinned a very small and
very thin gold medal But light as it was it had represented much
abstinence from estaminets and tobaccoshops on the part of its donors

Listen the Master said holding the medal in front of the collie
Listen while I read you the inscription To Bruce From some of the
boys he saved from the boches

Bruce was sniffing the thin gold lozenge interestedly The inscription
meant nothing to him Butstrong and vivid to his trained nostrilshe
scented on the medal the loving fingertouch of his old friend and
admirer TopSergeant Mahan
