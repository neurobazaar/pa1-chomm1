PIERRE GRASSOU


Whenever you have gone to take a serious look at the exhibition of works
of sculpture and painting such as it has been since the revolution
of 1830 have you not been seized by a sense of uneasiness weariness
sadness at the sight of those long and overcrowded galleries Since
1830 the true Salon no longer exists The Louvre has again been taken
by assaultthis time by a populace of artists who have maintained
themselves in it

In other days when the Salon presented only the choicest works of art
it conferred the highest honor on the creations there exhibited Among
the two hundred selected paintings the public could still choose a
crown was awarded to the masterpiece by hands unseen Eager impassioned
discussions arose about some picture The abuse showered on Delacroix
on Ingres contributed no less to their fame than the praises and
fanaticism of their adherents Today neither the crowd nor the
criticism grows impassioned about the products of that bazaar Forced to
make the selection for itself which in former days the examining
jury made for it the attention of the public is soon wearied and the
exhibition closes Before the year 1817 the pictures admitted never went
beyond the first two columns of the long gallery of the old masters but
in that year to the great astonishment of the public they filled the
whole space Historical highart genre paintings easel pictures
landscapes flowers animals and watercolorsthese eight specialties
could surely not offer more than twenty pictures in one year worthy of
the eyes of the public which indeed cannot give its attention to a
greater number of such works The more the number of artists increases
the more careful and exacting the jury of admission ought to be

The true character of the Salon was lost as soon as it spread along
the galleries The Salon should have remained within fixed limits of
inflexible proportions where each distinct specialty could show its
masterpieces only An experience of ten years has shown the excellence
of the former institution Now instead of a tournament we have a mob
instead of a noble exhibition we have a tumultuous bazaar instead of
a choice selection we have a chaotic mass What is the result A great
artist is swamped Decamps Turkish Cafe Children at a Fountain
Joseph and The Torture would have redounded far more to his credit
if the four pictures had been exhibited in the great Salon with the
hundred good pictures of that year than his twenty pictures could
among three thousand others jumbled together in six galleries

By some strange contradiction ever since the doors are open to every
one there has been much talk of unknown and unrecognized genius When
twelve years earlier Ingres Courtesan and that of Sigalon the
Medusa of Gericault the Massacre of Scio by Delacroix the Baptism
of Henri IV by Eugene Deveria admitted by celebrated artists accused
of jealousy showed the world in spite of the denials of criticism
that young and vigorous palettes existed no such complaint was made
Now when the veriest dauber of canvas can send in his work the whole
talk is of genius neglected Where judgment no longer exists there is
no longer anything judged But whatever artists may be doing now they
will come back in time to the examination and selection which presents
their works to the admiration of the crowd for whom they work Without
selection by the Academy there will be no Salon and without the Salon
art may perish

Ever since the catalogue has grown into a book many names have appeared
in it which still remain in their native obscurity in spite of the ten
or a dozen pictures attached to them Among these names perhaps the most
unknown to fame is that of an artist named Pierre Grassou coming from
Fougeres and called simply Fougeres among his brotherartists who
at the present moment holds a place as the saying is in the sun and
who suggested the rather bitter reflections by which this sketch of
his life is introducedreflections that are applicable to many other
individuals of the tribe of artists

In 1832 Fougeres lived in the rue de Navarin on the fourth floor of
one of those tall narrow houses which resemble the obelisk of Luxor
and possess an alley a dark little stairway with dangerous turnings
three windows only on each floor and within the building a courtyard
or to speak more correctly a square pit or well Above the three or
four rooms occupied by Grassou of Fougeres was his studio looking over
to Montmartre This studio was painted in brickcolor for a background
the floor was tinted brown and well frotted each chair was furnished
with a bit of carpet bound round the edges the sofa simple enough was
clean as that in the bedroom of some worthy bourgeoise All these things
denoted the tidy ways of a small mind and the thrift of a poor man A
bureau was there in which to put away the studio implements a table
for breakfast a sideboard a secretary in short all the articles
necessary to a painter neatly arranged and very clean The stove
participated in this Dutch cleanliness which was all the more visible
because the pure and little changing light from the north flooded with
its cold clear beams the vast apartment Fougeres being merely a genre
painter does not need the immense machinery and outfit which ruin
historical painters he has never recognized within himself sufficient
faculty to attempt highart and he therefore clings to easel painting

At the beginning of the month of December of that year a season at
which the bourgeois of Paris conceive periodically the burlesque idea
of perpetuating their forms and figures already too bulky in themselves
Pierre Grassou who had risen early prepared his palette and lighted
his stove was eating a roll steeped in milk and waiting till the frost
on his windows had melted sufficiently to let the full light in The
weather was fine and dry At this moment the artist who ate his bread
with that patient resigned air that tells so much heard and recognized
the step of a man who had upon his life the influence such men have
on the lives of nearly all artiststhe step of Elie Magus a
picturedealer a usurer in canvas The next moment Elie Magus entered
and found the painter in the act of beginning his work in the tidy
studio

How are you old rascal said the painter

Fougeres had the cross of the Legion of honor and Elie Magus bought his
pictures at two and three hundred francs apiece so he gave himself the
airs of a fine artist

Business is very bad replied Elie You artists have such
pretensions You talk of two hundred francs when you havent put six
sous worth of color on a canvas However you are a good fellow Ill
say that You are steady and Ive come to put a good bit of business in
your way

Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes said Fougeres Do you know Latin

No

Well it means that the Greeks never proposed a good bit of business
to the Trojans without getting their fair share of it In the olden time
they used to say Take my horse Now we say Take my bear Well
what do you want UlyssesLagingeoleElie Magus

These words will give an idea of the mildness and wit with which
Fougeres employed what painters call studio fun

Well I dont deny that you are to paint me two pictures for nothing

Oh oh

Ill leave you to do it or not I dont ask it But youre an honest
man

Come out with it

Well Im prepared to bring you a father mother and only daughter

All for me

Yesthey want their portraits taken These bourgeoisthey are crazy
about arthave never dared to enter a studio The girl has a dot of a
hundred thousand francs You can paint all threeperhaps theyll turn
out family portraits

And with that the old Dutch log of wood who passed for a man and who was
called Elie Magus interrupted himself to laugh an uncanny laugh which
frightened the painter He fancied he heard Mephistopheles talking
marriage

Portraits bring five hundred francs apiece went on Elie so you can
very well afford to paint me three pictures

True for you cried Fougeres gleefully

And if you marry the girl you wont forget me

Marry I cried Pierre GrassouI who have a habit of sleeping
alone and get up at cockcrow and all my life arranged

One hundred thousand francs said Magus and a quiet girl full of
golden tones as you call em like a Titian

What class of people are they

Retired merchants just now in love with art have a countryhouse at
Ville dAvray and ten or twelve thousand francs a year

What business did they do

Bottles

Now dont say that word it makes me think of corks and sets my teeth
on edge

Am I to bring them

Three portraitsI could put them in the Salon I might go in for
portraitpainting Well yes

Old Elie descended the staircase to go in search of the Vervelle family
To know to what extend this proposition would act upon the painter and
what effect would be produced upon him by the Sieur and Dame Vervelle
adorned by their only daughter it is necessary to cast an eye on the
anterior life of Pierre Grassou of Fougeres

When a pupil Fougeres had studied drawing with Servin who was
thought a great draughtsman in academic circles After that he went to
Schinners to learn the secrets of the powerful and magnificent color
which distinguishes that master Master and scholars were all discreet
at any rate Pierre discovered none of their secrets From there he went
to Sommervieux atelier to acquire that portion of the art of painting
which is called composition but composition was shy and distant to him
Then he tried to snatch from Decamps and Granet the mystery of their
interior effects The two masters were not robbed Finally Fougeres
ended his education with DuvalLecamus During these studied and
these different transformations Fougeres habits and ways of life were
tranquil and moral to a degree that furnished matter of jesting to the
various ateliers where he sojourned but everywhere he disarmed his
comrades by his modesty and by the patience and gentleness of a lamblike
nature The masters however had no sympathy for the good lad masters
prefer bright fellows eccentric spirits droll or fiery or else gloomy
and deeply reflective which argue future talent Everything about
Pierre Grassou smacked of mediocrity His nickname Fougeres that
of the painter in the play of The Eglantine was the source of much
teasing but by force of circumstances he accepted the name of the
town in which he had first seen light

Grassou of Fougeres resembled his name Plump and of medium height he
had a dull complexion brown eyes black hair a turnedup nose rather
wide mouth and long ears His gentle passive and resigned air gave a
certain relief to these leading features of a physiognomy that was full
of health but wanting in action This young man born to be a virtuous
bourgeois having left his native place and come to Paris to be clerk
with a colormerchant formerly of Mayenne and a distant connection of
the Orgemonts made himself a painter simply by the fact of an obstinacy
which constitutes the Breton character What he suffered the manner in
which he lived during those years of study God only knows He suffered
as much as great men suffer when they are hounded by poverty and hunted
like wild beasts by the pack of commonplace minds and by troops of
vanities athirst for vengeance

As soon as he thought himself able to fly on his own wings Fougeres
took a studio in the upper part of the rue des Martyrs where he began
to delve his way He made his first appearance in 1819 The first
picture he presented to the jury of the Exhibition at the Louvre
represented a village wedding rather laboriously copied from Greuzes
picture It was rejected When Fougeres heard of the fatal decision
he did not fall into one of those fits of epileptic selflove to which
strong natures give themselves up and which sometimes end in challenges
sent to the director or the secretary of the Museum or even by threats
of assassination Fougeres quietly fetched his canvas wrapped it in
a handkerchief and brought it home vowing in his heart that he would
still make himself a great painter He placed his picture on the easel
and went to one of his former masters a man of immense talentto
Schinner a kind and patient artist whose triumph at that years Salon
was complete Fougeres asked him to come and criticise the rejected
work The great painter left everything and went at once When poor
Fougeres had placed the work before him Schinner after a glance
pressed Fougeres hand

You are a fine fellow he said youve a heart of gold and I must
not deceive you Listen you are fulfilling all the promises you made in
the studios When you find such things as that at the tip of your brush
my good Fougeres you had better leave colors with Brullon and not take
the canvas of others Go home early put on your cotton nightcap and
be in bed by nine oclock The next morning early go to some government
office ask for a place and give up art

My dear friend said Fougeres my picture is already condemned it is
not a verdict that I want of you but the cause of that verdict

Wellyou paint gray and sombre you see nature being a crape veil
your drawing is heavy pasty your composition is a medley of Greuze
who only redeemed his defects by the qualities which you lack

While detailing these faults of the picture Schinner saw on Fougeres
face so deep an expression of sadness that he carried him off to dinner
and tried to console him The next morning at seven oclock Fougeres was
at his easel working over the rejected picture he warmed the colors he
made the corrections suggested by Schinner he touched up his figures
Then disgusted with such patching he carried the picture to Elie
Magus Elie Magus a sort of DutchFlemishBelgian had three reasons
for being what he becamerich and avaricious Coming last from
Bordeaux he was just starting in Paris selling old pictures and living
on the boulevard BonneNouvelle Fougeres who relied on his palette
to go to the bakers bravely ate bread and nuts or bread and milk or
bread and cherries or bread and cheese according to the seasons Elie
Magus to whom Pierre offered his first picture eyed it for some time
and then gave him fifteen francs

With fifteen francs a year coming in and a thousand francs for
expenses said Fougeres smiling a man will go fast and far

Elie Magus made a gesture he bit his thumbs thinking that he might
have had that picture for five francs

For several days Pierre walked down from the rue des Martyrs and
stationed himself at the corner of the boulevard opposite to Elies
shop whence his eye could rest upon his picture which did not obtain
any notice from the eyes of the passers along the street At the end of
a week the picture disappeared Fougeres walked slowly up and approached
the dealers shop in a lounging manner The Jew was at his door

Well I see you have sold my picture

No here it is said Magus Ive framed it to show it to some one
who fancies he knows about painting

Fougeres had not the heart to return to the boulevard He set about
another picture and spent two months upon iteating mouses meals and
working like a galleyslave

One evening he went to the boulevard his feet leading him fatefully to
the dealers shop His picture was not to be seen

Ive sold your picture said Elie Magus seeing him

For how much

I got back what I gave and a small interest Make me some Flemish
interiors a lesson of anatomy landscapes and such like and Ill buy
them of you said Elie

Fougeres would fain have taken old Magus in his arms he regarded him as
a father He went home with joy in his heart the great painter Schinner
was mistaken after all In that immense city of Paris there were some
hearts that beat in unison with Pierres his talent was understood and
appreciated The poor fellow of twentyseven had the innocence of a lad
of sixteen Another man one of those distrustful surly artists would
have noticed the diabolical look on Elies face and seen the twitching
of the hairs of his beard the irony of his moustache and the movement
of his shoulders which betrayed the satisfaction of Walter Scotts Jew
in swindling a Christian

Fougeres marched along the boulevard in a state of joy which gave to his
honest face an expression of pride He was like a schoolboy protecting
a woman He met Joseph Bridau one of his comrades and one of those
eccentric geniuses destined to fame and sorrow Joseph Bridau who had
to use his own expression a few sous in his pocket took Fougeres to
the Opera But Fougeres didnt see the ballet didnt hear the music he
was imagining pictures he was painting He left Joseph in the middle
of the evening and ran home to make sketches by lamplight He invented
thirty pictures all reminiscence and felt himself a man of genius The
next day he bought colors and canvases of various dimensions he piled
up bread and cheese on his table he filled a waterpot with water
he laid in a provision of wood for his stove then to use a studio
expression he dug at his pictures He hired several models and Magus
lent him stuffs

After two months seclusion the Breton had finished four pictures Again
he asked counsel of Schinner this time adding Bridau to the invitation
The two painters saw in three of these pictures a servile imitation
of Dutch landscapes and interiors by Metzu in the fourth a copy of
Rembrandts Lesson of Anatomy

Still imitating said Schinner Ah Fougeres cant manage to be
original

You ought to do something else than painting said Bridau

What asked Fougeres

Fling yourself into literature

Fougeres lowered his head like a sheep when it rains Then he asked and
obtained certain useful advice and retouched his pictures before taking
them to Elie Magus Elie paid him twentyfive francs apiece At that
price of course Fougeres earned nothing neither did he lose thanks to
his sober living He made a few excursions to the boulevard to see what
became of his pictures and there he underwent a singular hallucination
His neat clean paintings hard as tin and shiny as porcelain were
covered with a sort of mist they looked like old daubs Magus was out
and Pierre could obtain no information on this phenomenon He fancied
something was wrong with his eyes

The painter went back to his studio and made more pictures After seven
years of continued toil Fougeres managed to compose and execute quite
passable work He did as well as any artist of the second class
Elie bought and sold all the paintings of the poor Breton who earned
laboriously about two thousand francs a year while he spent but twelve
hundred

At the Exhibition of 1829 Leon de Lora Schinner and Bridau who all
three occupied a great position and were in fact at the head of the
art movement were filled with pity for the perseverance and the poverty
of their old friend and they caused to be admitted into the grand salon
of the Exhibition a picture by Fougeres This picture powerful in
interest but derived from Vigneron as to sentiment and from Dubufes
first manner as to execution represented a young man in prison whose
hair was being cut around the nape of the neck On one side was
a priest on the other two women one old one young in tears A
sheriffs clerk was reading aloud a document On a wretched table was a
meal untouched The light came in through the bars of a window near
the ceiling It was a picture fit to make the bourgeois shudder and
the bourgeois shuddered Fougeres had simply been inspired by the
masterpiece of Gerard Douw he had turned the group of the Dropsical
Woman toward the window instead of presenting it full front The
condemned man was substituted for the dying womansame pallor same
glance same appeal to God Instead of the Dutch doctor he had painted
the cold official figure of the sheriffs clerk attired in black but
he had added an old woman to the young one of Gerard Douw The cruelly
simple and goodhumored face of the executioner completed and dominated
the group This plagiarism very cleverly disguised was not discovered
The catalogue contained the following

 510 Grassou de Fougeres Pierre rue de Navarin 2
 Deathtoilet of a Chouan condemned to execution in 1809

Though wholly secondrate the picture had immense success for it
recalled the affair of the chauffeurs of Mortagne A crowd collected
every day before the now fashionable canvas even Charles X paused to
look at it Madame being told of the patient life of the poor Breton
became enthusiastic over him The Duc dOrleans asked the price of
the picture The clergy told Madame la Dauphine that the subject was
suggestive of good thoughts and there was in truth a most satisfying
religious tone about it Monseigneur the Dauphin admired the dust on
the stonefloora huge blunder by the way for Fougeres had painted
greenish tones suggestive of mildew along the base of the walls
Madame finally bought the picture for a thousand francs and the
Dauphin ordered another like it Charles X gave the cross of the Legion
of honor to this son of a peasant who had fought for the royal cause
in 1799 Joseph Bridau the great painter was not yet decorated The
minister of the Interior ordered two church pictures of Fougeres

This Salon of 1829 was to Pierre Grassou his whole fortune fame
future and life Be original invent and you die by inches copy
imitate and youll live After this discovery of a gold mine Grassou
de Fougeres obtained his benefit of the fatal principle to which society
owes the wretched mediocrities to whom are intrusted in these days the
election of leaders in all social classes who proceed naturally to
elect themselves and who wage a bitter war against all true talent The
principle of election applied indiscriminately is false and France will
some day abandon it

Nevertheless the modesty simplicity and genuine surprise of the good
and gentle Fougeres silenced all envy and all recriminations Besides
he had on his side all of his clan who had succeeded and all who
expected to succeed Some persons touched by the persistent energy of a
man whom nothing had discouraged talked of Domenichino and said

Perseverance in the arts should be rewarded Grassou hasnt stolen his
successes he has delved for ten years the poor dear man

That exclamation of poor dear man counted for half in the support
and the congratulations which the painter received Pity sets up
mediocrities as envy pulls down great talents and in equal numbers
The newspapers it is true did not spare criticism but the chevalier
Fougeres digested them as he had digested the counsel of his friends
with angelic patience

Possessing by this time fifteen thousand francs laboriously earned
he furnished an apartment and studio in the rue de Navarin and painted
the picture ordered by Monseigneur the Dauphin also the two church
pictures and delivered them at the time agreed on with a punctuality
that was very discomforting to the exchequer of the ministry accustomed
to a different course of action Butadmire the good fortune of men who
are methodicalif Grassou belated with his work had been caught by
the revolution of July he would not have got his money

By the time he was thirtyseven Fougeres had manufactured for Elie Magus
some two hundred pictures all of them utterly unknown by the help of
which he had attained to that satisfying manner that point of execution
before which the true artist shrugs his shoulders and the bourgeoisie
worships Fougeres was dear to friends for rectitude of ideas for
steadiness of sentiment absolute kindliness and great loyalty though
they had no esteem for his palette they loved the man who held it

What a misfortune it is that Fougeres has the vice of painting said
his comrades

But for all this Grassou gave excellent counsel like those
feuilletonists incapable of writing a book who know very well where a
book is wanting There was this difference however between literary
critics and Fougeres he was eminently sensitive to beauties he felt
them he acknowledged them and his advice was instinct with a spirit
of justice that made the justness of his remarks acceptable After
the revolution of July Fougeres sent about ten pictures a year to the
Salon of which the jury admitted four or five He lived with the most
rigid economy his household being managed solely by an old charwoman
For all amusement he visited his friends he went to see works of art
he allowed himself a few little trips about France and he planned to go
to Switzerland in search of inspiration This detestable artist was an
excellent citizen he mounted guard duly went to reviews and paid his
rent and provisionbills with bourgeois punctuality

Having lived all his life in toil and poverty he had never had the time
to love Poor and a bachelor until now he did not desire to complicate
his simple life Incapable of devising any means of increasing his
little fortune he carried every three months to his notary Cardot
his quarterly earnings and economies When the notary had received
about three thousand francs he invested them in some first mortgage the
interest of which he drew himself and added to the quarterly payments
made to him by Fougeres The painter was awaiting the fortunate moment
when his property thus laid by would give him the imposing income of two
thousand francs to allow himself the otium cum dignitate of the
artist and paint pictures but oh what pictures true pictures each a
finished picture chouette Koxnoff chocnosoff His future his dreams
of happiness the superlative of his hopesdo you know what it was
To enter the Institute and obtain the grade of officer of the Legion
of honor to side down beside Schinner and Leon de Lora to reach the
Academy before Bridau to wear a rosette in his buttonhole What a
dream It is only commonplace men who think of everything

Hearing the sound of several steps on the staircase Fougeres rubbed up
his hair buttoned his jacket of bottlegreen velveteen and was not a
little amazed to see entering his doorway a simpleton face vulgarly
called in studio slang a melon This fruit surmounted a pumpkin
clothed in blue cloth adorned with a bunch of tintinnabulating baubles
The melon puffed like a walrus the pumpkin advanced on turnips
improperly called legs A true painter would have turned the little
bottlevendor off at once assuring him that he didnt paint vegetables
This painter looked at his client without a smile for Monsieur Vervelle
wore a threethousandfranc diamond in the bosom of his shirt

Fougeres glanced at Magus and said Theres fat in it using a slang
term then much in vogue in the studios

Hearing those words Monsieur Vervelle frowned The worthy bourgeois drew
after him another complication of vegetables in the persons of his wife
and daughter The wife had a fine veneer of mahogany on her face and
in figure she resembled a cocoanut surmounted by a head and tied in
around the waist She pivoted on her legs which were taprooted
and her gown was yellow with black stripes She proudly exhibited
unutterable mittens on a puffy pair of hands the plumes of a
firstclass funeral floated on an overflowing bonnet laces adorned
her shoulders as round behind as they were before consequently the
spherical form of the cocoanut was perfect Her feet of a kind that
painters call abatis rose above the varnished leather of the shoes in a
swelling that was some inches high How the feet were ever got into the
shoes no one knows

Following these vegetable parents was a young asparagus who presented
a tiny head with smoothly banded hair of the yellowcarroty tone that a
Roman adores long stringy arms a fairly white skin with reddish spots
upon it large innocent eyes and white lashes scarcely any brows a
leghorn bonnet bound with white satin and adorned with two honest bows
of the same satin hands virtuously red and the feet of her mother The
faces of these three beings wore as they looked round the studio an
air of happiness which bespoke in them a respectable enthusiasm for Art

So it is you monsieur who are going to take our likenesses said the
father assuming a jaunty air

Yes monsieur replied Grassou

Vervelle he has the cross whispered the wife to the husband while
the painters back was turned

Should I be likely to have our portraits painted by an artist who
wasnt decorated returned the former bottledealer

Elie Magus here bowed to the Vervelle family and went away Grassou
accompanied him to the landing

Theres no one but you who would fish up such whales

One hundred thousand francs of dot

Yes but what a family

Three hundred thousand francs of expectations a house in the rue
Boucherat and a countryhouse at Ville dAvray

Bottles and corks bottles and corks said the painter they set my
teeth on edge

Safe from want for the rest of your days said Elie Magus as he
departed

That idea entered the head of Pierre Grassou as the daylight had burst
into his garret that morning

While he posed the father of the young person he thought the
bottledealer had a good countenance and he admired the face full
of violent tones The mother and daughter hovered about the easel
marvelling at all his preparations they evidently thought him a
demigod This visible admiration pleased Fougeres The golden calf threw
upon the family its fantastic reflections

You must earn lots of money but of course you dont spend it as you
get it said the mother

No madame replied the painter I dont spend it I have not the
means to amuse myself My notary invests my money he knows what I have
as soon as I have taken him the money I never think of it again

Ive always been told cried old Vervelle that artists were baskets
with holes in them

Who is your notaryif it is not indiscreet to ask said Madame
Vervelle

A good fellow all round replied Grassou His name is Cardot

Well well if that isnt a joke exclaimed Vervelle Cardot is our
notary too

Take care dont move said the painter

Do pray hold still Antenor said the wife If you move about youll
make monsieur miss you should just see him working and then youd
understand

Oh why didnt you have me taught the arts said Mademoiselle Vervelle
to her parents

Virginie said her mother a young person ought not to learn certain
things When you are marriedwell till then keep quiet

During this first sitting the Vervelle family became almost intimate
with the worthy artist They were to come again two days later As they
went away the father told Virginie to walk in front but in spite of
this separation she overheard the following words which naturally
awakened her curiosity

Decoratedthirtyseven years oldan artist who gets ordersputs his
money with our notary Well consult Cardot Hein Madame de Fougeres
not a bad namedoesnt look like a bad man either One might prefer a
merchant but before a merchant retires from business one can never know
what ones daughter may come to whereas an economical artistand then
you know we love ArtWell well see

While the Vervelle family discussed Pierre Grassou Pierre Grassou
discussed in his own mind the Vervelle family He found it impossible to
stay peacefully in his studio so he took a walk on the boulevard and
looked at all the redhaired women who passed him He made a series of
the oddest reasonings to himself gold was the handsomest of metals a
tawny yellow represented gold the Romans were fond of redhaired women
and he turned Roman etc After two years of marriage what man would
ever care about the color of his wifes hair Beauty fadesbut
ugliness remains Money is onehalf of all happiness That night when he
went to bed the painter had come to think Virginie Vervelle charming

When the three Vervelles arrived on the day of the second sitting the
artist received them with smiles The rascal had shaved and put on clean
linen he had also arranged his hair in a pleasing manner and chosen
a very becoming pair of trousers and red leather slippers with pointed
toes The family replied with smiles as flattering as those of the
artist Virginie became the color of her hair lowered her eyes and
turned aside her head to look at the sketches Pierre Grassou thought
these little affectations charming Virginie had such grace happily she
didnt look like her father or her mother but whom did she look like

During this sitting there were little skirmishes between the family
and the painter who had the audacity to call pere Vervelle witty This
flattery brought the family on the doublequick to the heart of the
artist he gave a drawing to the daughter and a sketch to the mother

What for nothing they said

Pierre Grassou could not help smiling

You shouldnt give away your pictures in that way they are money
said old Vervelle

At the third sitting pere Vervelle mentioned a fine gallery of pictures
which he had in his countryhouse at Ville dAvrayRubens Gerard Douw
Mieris Terburg Rembrandt Titian Paul Potter etc

Monsieur Vervelle has been very extravagant said Madame Vervelle
ostentatiously He has over one hundred thousand francs worth of
pictures

I love Art said the former bottledealer

When Madame Vervelles portrait was begun that of her husband was nearly
finished and the enthusiasm of the family knew no bounds The notary
had spoken in the highest praise of the painter Pierre Grassou was he
said one of the most honest fellows on earth he had laid by thirtysix
thousand francs his days of poverty were over he now saved about ten
thousand francs a year and capitalized the interest in short he was
incapable of making a woman unhappy This last remark had enormous
weight in the scales Vervelles friends now heard of nothing but the
celebrated painter Fougeres

The day on which Fougeres began the portrait of Mademoiselle Virginie
he was virtually soninlaw to the Vervelle family The three Vervelles
bloomed out in this studio which they were now accustomed to consider
as one of their residences there was to them an inexplicable attraction
in this clean neat pretty and artistic abode Abyssus abyssum the
commonplace attracts the commonplace Toward the end of the sitting the
stairway shook the door was violently thrust open by Joseph Bridau he
came like a whirlwind his hair flying He showed his grand haggard face
as he looked about him casting everywhere the lightning of his glance
then he walked round the whole studio and returned abruptly to Grassou
pulling his coat together over the gastric region and endeavouring but
in vain to button it the button mould having escaped from its capsule
of cloth

Wood is dear he said to Grassou

Ah

The British are after me slang term for creditors Gracious do you
paint such things as that

Hold your tongue

Ah to be sure yes

The Vervelle family extremely shocked by this extraordinary apparition
passed from its ordinary red to a cherryred two shades deeper

Brings in hey continued Joseph Any shot in your locker

How much do you want

Five hundred Ive got one of those bulldog dealers after me and if
the fellow once gets his teeth in he wont let go while theres a bit of
me left What a crew

Ill write you a line for my notary

Have you got a notary

Yes

That explains to me why you still make cheeks with pink tones like a
perfumers sign

Grassou could not help coloring for Virginie was sitting

Take Nature as you find her said the great painter going on with his
lecture Mademoiselle is redhaired Well is that a sin All things
are magnificent in painting Put some vermillion on your palette and
warm up those cheeks touch in those little brown spots come butter it
well in Do you pretend to have more sense than Nature

Look here said Fougeres take my place while I go and write that
note

Vervelle rolled to the table and whispered in Grassous ear

Wont that country lout spoilt it

If he would only paint the portrait of your Virginie it would be worth
a thousand times more than mine replied Fougeres vehemently

Hearing that reply the bourgeois beat a quiet retreat to his wife who
was stupefied by the invasion of this ferocious animal and very uneasy
at his cooperation in her daughters portrait

Here follow these indications said Bridau returning the palette
and taking the note I wont thank you I can go back now to dArthez
chateau where I am doing a diningroom and Leon de Lora the tops of
the doorsmasterpieces Come and see us

And off he went without taking leave having had enough of looking at
Virginie

Who is that man asked Madame Vervelle

A great artist answered Grassou

There was silence for a moment

Are you quite sure said Virginie that he has done no harm to my
portrait He frightened me

He has only done it good replied Grassou

Well if he is a great artist I prefer a great artist like you said
Madame Vervelle

The ways of genius had ruffled up these orderly bourgeois

The phase of autumn so pleasantly named Saint Martins summer was
just beginning With the timidity of a neophyte in presence of a man of
genius Vervelle risked giving Fougeres an invitation to come out to
his countryhouse on the following Sunday He knew he said how little
attraction a plain bourgeois family could offer to an artist

You artists he continued want emotions great scenes and witty
talk but youll find good wines and I rely on my collection of
pictures to compensate an artist like you for the bore of dining with
mere merchants

This form of idolatry which stroked his innocent selflove was
charming to our poor Pierre Grassou so little accustomed to such
compliments The honest artist that atrocious mediocrity that heart
of gold that loyal soul that stupid draughtsman that worthy fellow
decorated by royalty itself with the Legion of honor put himself under
arms to go out to Ville dAvray and enjoy the last fine days of the
year The painter went modestly by public conveyance and he could not
but admire the beautiful villa of the bottledealer standing in a park
of five acres at the summit of Ville dAvray commanding a noble view
of the landscape Marry Virginie and have that beautiful villa some day
for his own

He was received by the Vervelles with an enthusiasm a joy a
kindliness a frank bourgeois absurdity which confounded him It was
indeed a day of triumph The prospective soninlaw was marched about
the grounds on the nankeencolored paths all raked as they should be
for the steps of so great a man The trees themselves looked brushed and
combed and the lawns had just been mown The pure country air wafted
to the nostrils a most enticing smell of cooking All things about the
mansion seemed to say

We have a great artist among us

Little old Vervelle himself rolled like an apple through his park the
daughter meandered like an eel the mother followed with dignified step
These three beings never let go for one moment of Pierre Grassou
for seven hours After dinner the length of which equalled its
magnificence Monsieur and Madame Vervelle reached the moment of their
grand theatrical effectthe opening of the picture gallery illuminated
by lamps the reflections of which were managed with the utmost care
Three neighbours also retired merchants an old uncle from whom were
expectations an elderly Demoiselle Vervelle and a number of other
guests invited to be present at this ovation to a great artist followed
Grassou into the picture gallery all curious to hear his opinion of the
famous collection of pere Vervelle who was fond of oppressing them with
the fabulous value of his paintings The bottlemerchant seemed to have
the idea of competing with King LouisPhilippe and the galleries of
Versailles

The pictures magnificently framed each bore labels on which was read
in black letters on a gold ground

 Rubens
 Dance of fauns and nymphs

 Rembrandt
 Interior of a dissecting room The physician van Tromp
 instructing his pupils

In all there were one hundred and fifty pictures varnished and dusted
Some were covered with green baize curtains which were not undrawn in
presence of young ladies

Pierre Grassou stood with arms pendent gaping mouth and no word upon
his lips as he recognized half his own pictures in these works of art
He was Rubens he was Rembrandt Mieris Metzu Paul Potter Gerard
Douw He was twenty great masters all by himself

What is the matter Youve turned pale

Daughter a glass of water quick cried Madame Vervelle The painter
took pere Vervelle by the button of his coat and led him to a corner on
pretence of looking at a Murillo Spanish pictures were then the rage

You bought your pictures from Elie Magus

Yes all originals

Between ourselves tell me what he made you pay for those I shall point
out to you

Together they walked round the gallery The guests were amazed at the
gravity in which the artist proceeded in company with the host to
examine each picture

Three thousand francs said Vervelle in a whisper as they reached the
last but I tell everybody forty thousand

Forty thousand for a Titian said the artist aloud Why it is
nothing at all

Didnt I tell you said Vervelle that I had three hundred thousand
francs worth of pictures

I painted those pictures said Pierre Grassou in Vervelles ear and
I sold them one by one to Elie Magus for less than ten thousand francs
the whole lot

Prove it to me said the bottledealer and I double my daughters
dot for if it is so you are Rubens Rembrandt Titian Gerard Douw

And Magus is a famous picturedealer said the painter who now saw
the meaning of the misty and aged look imparted to his pictures in
Elies shop and the utility of the subjects the picturedealer had
required of him

Far from losing the esteem of his admiring bottlemerchant Monsieur
de Fougeres for so the family persisted in calling Pierre Grassou
advanced so much that when the portraits were finished he presented them
gratuitously to his fatherinlaw his motherinlaw and his wife

At the present day Pierre Grassou who never misses exhibiting at the
Salon passes in bourgeois regions for a fine portraitpainter He earns
some twenty thousand francs a year and spoils a thousand francs worth
of canvas His wife has six thousand francs a year in dowry and he
lives with his fatherinlaw The Vervelles and the Grassous who agree
delightfully keep a carriage and are the happiest people on earth
Pierre Grassou never emerges from the bourgeois circle in which he
is considered one of the greatest artists of the period Not a family
portrait is painted between the barrier du Trone and the rue du Temple
that is not done by this great painter none of them costs less than
five hundred francs The great reason which the bourgeois families have
for employing him is this

Say what you will of him he lays by twenty thousand francs a year with
his notary

As Grassou took a creditable part on the occasion of the riots of May
12th he was appointed an officer of the Legion of honor He is a major
in the National Guard The Museum of Versailles felt it incumbent to
order a battlepiece of so excellent a citizen who thereupon walked
about Paris to meet his old comrades and have the happiness of saying to
them

The King has given me an order for the Museum of Versailles

Madame de Fougeres adores her husband to whom she has presented two
children This painter a good father and a good husband is unable to
eradicate from his heart a fatal thought namely that artists laugh at
his work that his name is a term of contempt in the studios and that
the feuilletons take no notice of his pictures But he still works on
he aims for the Academy where undoubtedly he will enter Andoh
vengeance which dilates his hearthe buys the pictures of celebrated
artists who are pinched for means and he substitutes these true works
of arts that are not his own for the wretched daubs in the collection at
Ville dAvray

There are many mediocrities more aggressive and more mischievous than
that of Pierre Grassou who is moreover anonymously benevolent and
truly obliging
