VOLUME I DEPARTMENTAL DITTIES AND OTHER VERSES

 I have eaten your bread and salt
 I have drunk your water and wine
 The deaths ye died I have watched beside
 And the lives that ye led were mine

 Was there aught that I did not share
 In vigil or toil or ease
 One joy or woe that I did not know
 Dear hearts across the seas

 I have written the tale of our life
 For a sheltered peoples mirth
 In jesting guisebut ye are wise
 And ye know what the jest is worth




GENERAL SUMMARY

 We are very slightly changed
 From the semiapes who ranged
 Indias prehistoric clay
 Whoso drew the longest bow
 Ran his brother down you know
 As we run men down today

 Dowb the first of all his race
 Met the Mammoth face to face
 On the lake or in the cave
 Stole the steadiest canoe
 Ate the quarry others slew
 Diedand took the finest grave

 When they scratched the reindeerbone
 Someone made the sketch his own
 Filched it from the artistthen
 Even in those early days
 Won a simple Viceroys praise
 Through the toil of other men

 Ere they hewed the Sphinxs visage
 Favoritism governed kissage
 Even as it does in this age

 Who shall doubt the secret hid
 Under Cheops pyramid
 Was that the contractor did
 Cheops out of several millions
 Or that Josephs sudden rise
 To Comptroller of Supplies
 Was a fraud of monstrous size
 On King Pharoahs swart Civilians

 Thus the artless songs I sing
 Do not deal with anything
 New or never said before

 As it was in the beginning
 Is today official sinning
 And shall be forevermore




ARMY HEADQUARTERS

 Old is the song that I sing
 Old as my unpaid bills
 Old as the chicken that kitmutgars bring
 Men at dakbungalowsold as the Hills

 Ahasuerus Jenkins of the Operatic Own
 Was dowered with a tenor voice of superSantley tone

 His views on equitation were perhaps a trifle queer
 He had no seat worth mentioning but oh he had an ear

 He clubbed his wretched company a dozen times a day
 He used to quit his charger in a parabolic way
 His method of saluting was the joy of all beholders
 But Ahasuerus Jenkins had a head upon his shoulders

 He took two months to Simla when the year was at the spring
 And underneath the deodars eternally did sing

 He warbled like a bulbul but particularly at
 Cornelia Agrippina who was musical and fat

 She controlled a humble husband who in turn controlled a Dept
 Where Cornelia Agrippinas human singingbirds were kept
 From April to October on a plump retaining fee
 Supplied of course per mensem by the Indian Treasury

 Cornelia used to sing with him and Jenkins used to play
 He praised unblushingly her notes for he was false as they
 So when the winds of April turned the budding roses brown
 Cornelia told her husband Tom you mustnt send him down

 They haled him from his regiment which didnt much regret him
 They found for him an officestool and on that stool they set him
 To play with maps and catalogues three idle hours a day
 And draw his plump retaining feewhich means his double pay

 Now ever after dinner when the coffeecups are brought
 Ahasuerus waileth oer the grand pianoforte
 And thanks to fair Cornelia his fame hath waxen great
 And Ahasuerus Jenkins is a power in the State




STUDY OF AN ELEVATION IN INDIAN INK

 This ditty is a string of lies
 Buthow the deuce did Gubbins rise

 POTIPHAR GUBBINS C E
 Stands at the top of the tree
 And I muse in my bed on the reasons that led
 To the hoisting of Potiphar G

 Potiphar Gubbins C E
 Is seven years junior to Me
 Each bridge that he makes he either buckles or breaks
 And his work is as rough as he

 Potiphar Gubbins C E
 Is coarse as a chimpanzee
 And I cant understand why you gave him your hand
 Lovely Mehitabel Lee

 Potiphar Gubbins C E
 Is dear to the Powers that Be
 For They bow and They smile in an affable style
 Which is seldom accorded to Me

 Potiphar Gubbins C E
 Is certain as certain can be
 Of a highlypaid post which is claimed by a host
 Of seniorsincluding Me

 Careless and lazy is he
 Greatly inferior to Me

 What is the spell that you manage so well
 Commonplace Potiphar G

 Lovely Mehitabel Lee
 Let me inquire of thee
 Should I have riz to what Potiphar is
 Hadst thou been mated to me




A LEGEND

 This is the reason why Rustum Beg
 Rajah of Kolazai
 Drinketh the simpkin and brandy peg
 Maketh the money to fly
 Vexeth a Government tender and kind
 Alsobut this is a detailblind

 RUSTUM BEG of Kolazaislightly backward native state
 Lusted for a C S Iso began to sanitate
 Built a Jail and Hospitalnearly built a City drain
 Till his faithful subjects all thought their Ruler was insane

 Strange departures made he thenyea Departments stranger still
 Half a dozen Englishmen helped the Rajah with a will
 Talked of noble aims and high hinted of a future fine
 For the state of Kolazai on a strictly Western line

 Rajah Rustum held his peace lowered octroi dues a half
 Organized a State Police purified the Civil Staff
 Settled cess and tax afresh in a very liberal way
 Cut temptations of the fleshalso cut the Bukhshis pay

 Roused his Secretariat to a fine Mahratta fury
 By a Hookum hinting at supervision of dasturi
 Turned the State of Kolazai very nearly upsidedown
 When the end of May was nigh waited his achievement crown

 When the Birthday Honors came
 Sad to state and sad to see
 Stood against the Rajahs name nothing more than C I E
     

 Things were lively for a week in the State of Kolazai
 Even now the people speak of that time regretfully

 How he disendowed the Jailstopped at once the City drain
 Turned to beauty fair and frailgot his senses back again
 Doubled taxes cesses all cleared away each newbuilt thana
 Turned the twolakh Hospital into a superb Zenana

 Heaped upon the Bukhshi Sahib wealth and honors manifold
 Clad himself in Eastern garbsqueezed his people as of old

 Happy happy Kolazai Never more will Rustum Beg
 Play to catch the Viceroys eye He prefers the simpkin peg




THE STORY OF URIAH

 Now there were two men in one city
 the one rich and the other poor

 Jack Barrett went to Quetta
 Because they told him to
 He left his wife at Simla
 On threefourths his monthly screw
 Jack Barrett died at Quetta
 Ere the next months pay he drew

 Jack Barrett went to Quetta
 He didnt understand
 The reason of his transfer
 From the pleasant mountainland
 The season was September
 And it killed him out of hand

 Jack Barrett went to Quetta
 And there gave up the ghost
 Attempting two mens duty
 In that very healthy post
 And Mrs Barrett mourned for him
 Five lively months at most

 Jack Barretts bones at Quetta
 Enjoy profound repose
 But I shouldnt be astonished
 If now his spirit knows
 The reason of his transfer
 From the Himalayan snows

 And when the Last Great Bugle Call
 Adown the Hurnal throbs
 When the last grim joke is entered
 In the big black Book of Jobs
 And Quetta graveyards give again
 Their victims to the air
 I shouldnt like to be the man
 Who sent Jack Barrett there




THE POST THAT FITTED

 Though tangled and twisted the course of true love
 This ditty explains
 No tangles so tangled it cannot improve
 If the Lover has brains

 Ere the steamer bore him Eastward Sleary was engaged to marry
 An attractive girl at Tunbridge whom he called my little Carrie

 Slearys pay was very modest Sleary was the other way
 Who can cook a twoplate dinner on eight poor rupees a day

 Long he pondered oer the question in his scantly furnished quarters
 Then proposed to Minnie Boffkin eldest of Judge Boffkins daughters

 Certainly an impecunious Subaltern was not a catch
 But the Boffkins knew that Minnie mightnt make another match

 So they recognised the business and to feed and clothe the bride
 Got him made a Something Something somewhere on the Bombay side

 Anyhow the billet carried pay enough for him to marry
 As the artless Sleary put itJust the thing for me and Carrie

 Did he therefore jilt Miss Boffkinimpulse of a baser mind
 No He started epileptic fits of an appalling kind

 Of his modus operandi only this much I could gather
 Pearss shaving sticks will give you little taste and lots of lather

 Frequently in public places his affliction used to smite
 Sleary with distressing vigouralways in the Boffkins sight

 Ere a week was over Minnie weepingly returned his ring
 Told him his unhappy weakness stopped all thought of marrying

 Sleary bore the information with a chastened holy joy
 Epileptic fits dont matter in Political employ
 Wired three short words to Carrietook his ticket packed his kit
 Bade farewell to Minnie Boffkin in one last long lingering fit

 Four weeks later Carrie Sleary readand laughed until she wept
 Mrs Boffkins warning letter on the wretched epilept

 Year by year in pious patience vengeful Mrs Boffkin sits
 Waiting for the Sleary babies to develop Slearys fits

 PUBLIC WASTE

 Walpole talks of a man and his price
 List to a ditty queer
 The sale of a DeputyActingVice
 ResidentEngineer
 Bought like a bullock hoof and hide
 By the Little Tin Gods on the Mountain Side

 By the Laws of the Family Circle tis written in letters of brass
 That only a Colonel from Chatham can manage the Railways of State
 Because of the gold on his breeks and the subjects wherein he must pass
 Because in all matters that deal not with Railways his knowledge is great

 Now Exeter Battleby Tring had laboured from boyhood to eld
 On the Lines of the East and the West and eke of the North and South
 Many Lines had he built and surveyedimportant the posts which he held
 And the Lords of the Iron Horse were dumb when he opened his mouth

 Black as the raven his garb and his heresies jettier still
 Hinting that Railways required lifetimes of study and knowledge
 Never clanked sword by his sideVauban he knew not nor drill
 Nor was his name on the list of the men who had passed through the College

 Wherefore the Little Tin Gods harried their little tin souls
 Seeing he came not from Chatham jingled no spurs at his heels
 Knowing that nevertheless was he first on the Government rolls
 For the billet of Railway Instructor to Little Tin Gods on Wheels

 Letters not seldom they wrote him having the honour to state
 It would be better for all men if he were laid on the shelf
 Much would accrue to his bankbook an he consented to wait
 Until the Little Tin Gods built him a berth for himself

 Special well paid and exempt from the Law of the Fifty and Five
 Even to Ninety and Ninethese were the terms of the pact
 Thus did the Little Tin Gods long may Their Highnesses thrive
 Silence his mouth with rupees keeping their Circle intact

 Appointing a Colonel from Chatham who managed the Bhamo State Line
 The which was one mile and one furlonga guaranteed twentyinch gauge
 So Exeter Battleby Tring consented his claims to resign
 And died on four thousand a month in the ninetieth year of his age




DELILAH

 We have another viceroy nowthose days are dead and done
 Of Delilah Aberyswith and depraved Ulysses Gunne

 Delilah Aberyswith was a ladynot too young
 With a perfect taste in dresses and a badlybitted tongue
 With a thirst for information and a greater thirst for praise
 And a little house in Simla in the Prehistoric Days

 By reason of her marriage to a gentleman in power
 Delilah was acquainted with the gossip of the hour
 And many little secrets of the halfofficial kind
 Were whispered to Delilah and she bore them all in mind

 She patronized extensively a man Ulysses Gunne
 Whose mode of earning money was a low and shameful one
 He wrote for certain papers which as everybody knows
 Is worse than serving in a shop or scaring off the crows

 He praised her queenly beauty first and later on he hinted
 At the vastness of her intellect with compliment unstinted
 He went with her ariding and his love for her was such
 That he lent her all his horses andshe galled them very much

 One day THEY brewed a secret of a fine financial sort
 It related to Appointments to a Man and a Report
 Twas almost worth the keepingonly seven people knew it
 And Gunne rose up to seek the truth and patiently pursue it

 It was a Viceroys Secret butperhaps the wine was red
 Perhaps an Aged Councillor had lost his aged head
 Perhaps Delilahs eyes were brightDelilahs whispers sweet
 The Aged Member told her what twere treason to repeat

 Ulysses went ariding and they talked of love and flowers
 Ulysses went acalling and he called for several hours
 Ulysses went awaltzing and Delilah helped him dance
 Ulysses let the waltzes go and waited for his chance

 The summer sun was setting and the summer air was still
 The couple went awalking in the shade of Summer Hill
 The wasteful sunset faded out in Turkishgreen and gold
 Ulysses pleaded softly and that bad Delilah told

 Next morn a startled Empire learnt the allimportant news
 Next week the Aged Councillor was shaking in his shoes
 Next month I met Delilah and she did not show the least
 Hesitation in affirming that Ulysses was a beast
     

 We have another Viceroy now those days are dead and done
 Of Delilah Aberyswith and most mean Ulysses Gunne




WHAT HAPPENED

 Hurree Chunder Mookerjee pride of Bow Bazaar
 Owner of a native press BarrishteratLar
 Waited on the Government with a claim to wear
 Sabres by the bucketful rifles by the pair

 Then the Indian Government winked a wicked wink
 Said to Chunder Mookerjee Stick to pen and ink
 They are safer implements but if you insist
 We will let you carry arms wheresoeer you list

 Hurree Chunder Mookerjee sought the gunsmith and
 Bought the tubes of Lancaster Ballard Dean and Bland
 Bought a shiny bowieknife bought a townmade sword
 Jingled like a carriagehorse when he went abroad

 But the Indian Government always keen to please
 Also gave permission to horrid men like these
 Yar Mahommed Yusufzai down to kill or steal
 Chimbu Singh from Bikaneer Tantia the Bhil

 Killar Khan the Marri chief Jowar Singh the Sikh
 Nubbee Baksh Punjabi Jat Abdul Huq Rafiq
 He was a Wahabi last little Boh Hlaoo
 Took advantage of the Acttook a Snider too

 They were unenlightened men Ballard knew them not
 They procured their swords and guns chiefly on the spot
 And the lore of centuries plus a hundred fights
 Made them slow to disregard one anothers rights

 With a unanimity dear to patriot hearts
 All those hairy gentlemen out of foreign parts
 Said The good old days are backlet us go to war
 Swaggered down the Grand Trunk Road into Bow Bazaar

 Nubbee Baksh Punjabi Jat found a hidebound flail
 Chimbu Singh from Bikaneer oiled his Tonk jezail
 Yar Mahommed Yusufzai spat and grinned with glee
 As he ground the butcherknife of the Khyberee

 Jowar Singh the Sikh procured sabre quoit and mace
 Abdul Huq Wahabi jerked his dagger from its place
 While amid the junglegrass danced and grinned and jabbered
 Little Boh Hlaoo and cleared his dahblade from the scabbard

 What became of Mookerjee Soothly who can say
 Yar Mahommed only grins in a nasty way
 Jowar Singh is reticent Chimbu Singh is mute
 But the belts of all of them simply bulge with loot

 What became of Ballards guns Afghans black and grubby
 Sell them for their silver weight to the men of Pubbi
 And the shiny bowieknife and the townmade sword are
 Hanging in a Marri camp just across the Border

 What became of Mookerjee Ask Mahommed Yar
 Prodding Sivas sacred bull down the Bow Bazaar
 Speak to placid Nubbee Bakshquestion land and sea
 Ask the Indian Congressmenonly dont ask me




PINK DOMINOES

 They are fools who kiss and tell
 Wisely has the poet sung
 Man may hold all sorts of posts
 If hell only hold his tongue

 Jenny and Me were engaged you see
 On the eve of the Fancy Ball
 So a kiss or two was nothing to you
 Or any one else at all

 Jenny would go in a domino
 Pretty and pink but warm
 While I attended clad in a splendid
 Austrian uniform

 Now we had arranged through notes exchanged
 Early that afternoon
 At Number Four to waltz no more
 But to sit in the dusk and spoon

 I wish you to see that Jenny and Me
 Had barely exchanged our troth
 So a kiss or two was strictly due
 By from and between us both

 When Three was over an eager lover
 I fled to the gloom outside
 And a Domino came out also
 Whom I took for my future bride

 That is to say in a casual way
 I slipped my arm around her
 With a kiss or two which is nothing to you
 And ready to kiss I found her

 She turned her head and the name she said
 Was certainly not my own
 But ere I could speak with a smothered shriek
 She fled and left me alone

 Then Jenny came and I saw with shame
 Shed doffed her domino
 And I had embraced an alien waist
 But I did not tell her so

 Next morn I knew that there were two
 Dominoes pink and one
 Had cloaked the spouse of Sir Julian House
 Our big Political gun

 Sir J was old and her hair was gold
 And her eye was a blue cerulean
 And the name she said when she turned her head
 Was not in the least like Julian




THE MAN WHO COULD WRITE

 Shunshun the Bowl That fatal facile drink
 Has ruined many geese who dipped their quills in t
 Bribe murder marry but steer clear of Ink
 Save when you write receipts for paidup bills in t

 There may be silver in the blueblackall
 I know of is the iron and the gall

 Boanerges Blitzen servant of the Queen
 Is a dismal failureis a Mighthavebeen
 In a luckless moment he discovered men
 Rise to high position through a ready pen
 Boanerges Blitzen argued thereforeI
 With the selfsame weapon can attain as high
 Only he did not possess when he made the trial
 Wicked wit of Clvn irony of Ll

 Men who spar with Government need to back their blows
 Something more than ordinary journalistic prose

 Never young Civilians prospects were so bright
 Till an Indian paper found that he could write
 Never young Civilians prospects were so dark
 When the wretched Blitzen wrote to make his mark
 Certainly he scored it bold and black and firm
 In that Indian papermade his seniors squirm
 Quoted office scandals wrote the tactless truth
 Was there ever known a more misguided youth
 When the Rag he wrote for praised his plucky game
 Boanerges Blitzen felt that this was Fame
 When the men he wrote of shook their heads and swore
 Boanerges Blitzen only wrote the more

 Posed as Young Ithuriel resolute and grim
 Till he found promotion didnt come to him
 Till he found that reprimands weekly were his lot
 And his many Districts curiously hot

 Till he found his furlough strangely hard to win
 Boanerges Blitzen didnt care to pin
 Then it seemed to dawn on him something wasnt right
 Boanerges Blitzen put it down to spite

 Languished in a District desolate and dry
 Watched the Local Government yearly pass him by
 Wondered where the hitch was called it most unfair
         

 That was seven years agoand he still is there




MUNICIPAL

 Why is my District deathrate low
 Said Binks of Hezabad
 Well drains and sewageoutfalls are
 My own peculiar fad

 I learnt a lesson once It ran
 Thus quoth that most veracious man

 It was an August evening and in snowy garments clad
 I paid a round of visits in the lines of Hezabad
 When presently my Waler saw and did not like at all
 A Commissariat elephant careering down the Mall

 I couldnt see the driver and across my mind it rushed
 That that Commissariat elephant had suddenly gone musth

 I didnt care to meet him and I couldnt well get down
 So I let the Waler have it and we headed for the town

 The buggy was a new one and praise Dykes it stood the strain
 Till the Waler jumped a bullock just above the City Drain
 And the next that I remember was a hurricane of squeals
 And the creature making toothpicks of my fivefoot patent wheels

 He seemed to want the owner so I fled distraught with fear
 To the Main Drain sewageoutfall while he snorted in my ear
 Reached the fourfoot drainhead safely and in darkness and despair
 Felt the brutes proboscis fingering my terrorstiffened hair

 Heard it trumpet on my shouldertried to crawl a little higher
 Found the Main Drain sewage outfall blocked some eight feet up with mire
 And for twenty reeking minutes Sir my very marrow froze
 While the trunk was feeling blindly for a purchase on my toes

 It missed me by a fraction but my hair was turning grey
 Before they called the drivers up and dragged the brute away

 Then I sought the City Elders and my words were very plain
 They flushed that fourfoot drainhead andit never choked again

 You may hold with surfacedrainage and the sunforgarbage cure
 Till youve been a periwinkle shrinking coyly up a sewer

 I believe in wellflushed culverts

 This is why the deathrates small
 And if you dont believe me get shikarred yourself Thats all




A CODE OF MORALS

 Lest you should think this story true
 I merely mention I
 Evolved it lately Tis a most
 Unmitigated misstatement

 Now Jones had left his newwed bride to keep his house in order
 And hied away to the Hurrum Hills above the Afghan border
 To sit on a rock with a heliograph but ere he left he taught
 His wife the working of the Code that sets the miles at naught

 And Love had made him very sage as Nature made her fair
 So Cupid and Apollo linked per heliograph the pair
 At dawn across the Hurrum Hills he flashed her counsel wise
 At een the dying sunset bore her husbands homilies

 He warned her gainst seductive youths in scarlet clad and gold
 As much as gainst the blandishments paternal of the old
 But kept his gravest warnings for hereby the ditty hangs
 That snowyhaired Lothario LieutenantGeneral Bangs

 Twas General Bangs with Aide and Staff who tittupped on the way
 When they beheld a heliograph tempestuously at play
 They thought of Border risings and of stations sacked and burnt
 So stopped to take the message downand this is what they learnt

 Dash dot dot dot dot dash dot dash dot twice The General swore

 Was ever General Officer addressed as dear before
 My Love i faith My Duck Gadzooks My darling popsywop
 Spirit of great Lord Wolseley who is on that mountaintop

 The artless Aidedecamp was mute the gilded Staff were still
 As dumb with pentup mirth they booked that message from the hill
 For clear as summer lightningflare the husbands warning ran
 Dont dance or ride with General Bangsa most immoral man

 At dawn across the Hurrum Hills he flashed her counsel wise
 But howsoever Love be blind the world at large hath eyes
 With damnatory dot and dash he heliographed his wife
 Some interesting details of the Generals private life

 The artless Aidedecamp was mute the shining Staff were still
 And red and ever redder grew the Generals shaven gill

 And this is what he said at last his feelings matter not
 I think weve tapped a private line Hi Threes about there Trot

 All honour unto Bangs for neer did Jones thereafter know
 By word or act official who read off that helio

 But the tale is on the Frontier and from Michni to Mooltan
 They know the worthy General as that most immoral man




THE LAST DEPARTMENT

 Twelve hundred million men are spread
 About this Earth and I and You
 Wonder when You and I are dead
 What will those luckless millions do

 None whole or clean we cry or free from stain
 Of favour Wait awhile till we attain
 The Last Department where nor fraud nor fools
 Nor grade nor greed shall trouble us again

 Fear Favour or Affectionwhat are these
 To the grim Head who claims our services
 I never knew a wife or interest yet
 Delay that pukka step miscalled decease

 When leave long overdue none can deny
 When idleness of all Eternity
 Becomes our furlough and the marigold
 Our thriftless bullionminting Treasury

 Transferred to the Eternal Settlement
 Each in his strait woodscantled office pent
 No longer Brown reverses Smiths appeals
 Or Jones records his Minute of Dissent

 And One long since a pillar of the Court
 As mud between the beams thereof is wrought
 And One who wrote on phosphates for the crops
 Is subjectmatter of his own Report

 These be the glorious ends whereto we pass
 Let Him who Is go call on Him who Was
 And He shall see the mallie steals the slab
 For curriegrinder and for goats the grass

 A breath of wind a Border bullets flight
 A draught of water or a horses fright
 The droning of the fat Sheristadar
 Ceases the punkah stops and falls the night

 For you or Me Do those who live decline
 The step that offers or their work resign
 Trust me Todays Most Indispensables
 Five hundred men can take your place or mine




OTHER VERSES




RECESSIONAL
 A Victorian Ode

 God of our fathers known of old
 Lord of our farflung battle line
 Beneath whose awful hand we hold
 Dominion over palm and pine

 Lord God of Hosts be with us yet
 Lest we forgetlest we forget

 The tumult and the shouting dies
 The Captains and the Kings depart
 Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice
 An humble and a contrite heart

 Lord God of Hosts be with us yet
 Lest we forgetlest we forget

 Farcalled our navies melt away
 On dune and headland sinks the fire
 Lo all our pomp of yesterday
 Is one with Nineveh and Tyre

 Judge of the Nations spare us yet
 Lest we forgetlest we forget

 If drunk with sight of power we loose
 Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe
 Such boastings as the Gentiles use
 Or lesser breeds without the Law

 Lord God of Hosts be with us yet
 Lest we forgetlest we forget

 For heathen heart that puts her trust
 In reeking tube and iron shard
 All valiant dust that builds on dust
 And guarding calls not Thee to guard

 For frantic boast and foolish word
 Thy Mercy on Thy People Lord
 Amen




THE VAMPIRE

 The versesas suggested by the painting by Philip Burne Jones first
 exhibited at the new gallery in London in 1897

 A fool there was and he made his prayer
 Even as you and I
 To a rag and a bone and a hank of hair
 We called her the woman who did not care
 But the fool he called her his lady fair
 Even as you and I

 Oh the years we waste and the tears we waste
 And the work of our head and hand
 Belong to the woman who did not know
 And now we know that she never could know
 And did not understand

 A fool there was and his goods he spent
 Even as you and I
 Honor and faith and a sure intent
 But a fool must follow his natural bent
 And it wasnt the least what the lady meant
 Even as you and I

 Oh the toil we lost and the spoil we lost
 And the excellent things we planned
 Belong to the woman who didnt know why
 And now we know she never knew why
 And did not understand

 The fool we stripped to his foolish hide
 Even as you and I
 Which she might have seen when she threw him aside
 But it isnt on record the lady tried
 So some of him lived but the most of him died
 Even as you and I

 And it isnt the shame and it isnt the blame
 That stings like a white hot brand

 Its coming to know that she never knew why
 Seeing at last she could never know why
 And never could understand




TO THE UNKNOWN GODDESS

 Will you conquer my heart with your beauty my soul going out from afar
 Shall I fall to your hand as a victim of crafty and cautious shikar

 Have I met you and passed you already unknowing unthinking and blind
 Shall I meet you next session at Simla O sweetest and best of your kind

 Does the P and O bear you to meward or clad in short frocks in the West
 Are you growing the charms that shall capture and torture the heart in my
 breast

 Will you stay in the Plains till Septembermy passion as warm as the day
 Will you bring me to book on the Mountains or where the thermantidotes play

 When the light of your eyes shall make pallid the mean lesser lights I pursue
 And the charm of your presence shall lure me from love of the gay thirteen
 two

 When the peg and the pigskin shall please not when I buy me Calcuttabuild
 clothes
 When I quit the Delight of Wild Asses forswearing the swearing of oaths
 As a deer to the hand of the hunter when I turn mid the gibes of my friends
 When the days of my freedom are numbered and the life of the bachelor ends

 Ah Goddess child spinster or widowas of old on Mars Hill whey they
 raised
 To the God that they knew not an altarso I a young Pagan have praised
 The Goddess I know not nor worship yet if half that men tell me be true
 You will come in the future and therefore these verses are written to you




THE RUPAIYAT OF OMAR KALVIN

 Allowing for the difference twixt prose and rhymed exaggeration this ought
 to reproduce the sense of what Sir A told the nation sometime ago when the
 Government struck from our incomes two per cent

 Now the New Year reviving last Years Debt
 The Thoughtful Fisher casteth wide his Net
 So I with begging Dish and ready Tongue
 Assail all Men for all that I can get

 Imports indeed are gone with all their Dues
 Lo Salt a Lever that I dare not use
 Nor may I ask the Tillers in Bengal
 Surely my Kith and Kin will not refuse

 Payand I promise by the Dust of Spring
 Retrenchment If my promises can bring
 Comfort Ye have Them now a thousandfold
 By Allah I will promise Anything

 Indeed indeed Retrenchment oft before
 I sworebut did I mean it when I swore
 And then and then We wandered to the Hills
 And so the Little Less became Much More

 Whether a Boileaugunge or Babylon
 I know not how the wretched Thing is done
 The Items of Receipt grow surely small
 The Items of Expense mount one by one

 I cannot help it What have I to do
 With One and Five or Four or Three or Two
 Let Scribes spit Blood and Sulphur as they please
 Or Statesmen call me foolishHeed not you

 Behold I promiseAnything You will
 Behold I greet you with an empty Till
 Ah FellowSinners of your Charity
 Seek not the Reason of the Dearth but fill

 For if I sinned and fell where lies the Gain
 Of Knowledge Would it ease you of your Pain
 To know the tangled Threads of Revenue
 I ravel deeper in a hopeless Skein

 Who hath not Prudencewhat was it I said
 Of Her who paints her Eyes and tires Her Head
 And gibes and mocks the People in the Street
 And fawns upon them for Her thriftless Bread

 Accursed is She of Eves daughtersShe
 Hath cast off Prudence and Her End shall be
 Destruction Brethren of your Bounty
 Some portion of your daily Bread to Me




LA NUIT BLANCHE

 A muchdiscerning Public hold
 The Singer generally sings
 And prints and sells his past for gold

 Whatever I may here disclaim
 The very clever folk I sing to
 Will most indubitably cling to
 Their pet delusion just the same

 I had seen as the dawn was breaking
 And I staggered to my rest
 Tari Devi softly shaking
 From the Cart Road to the crest

 I had seen the spurs of Jakko
 Heave and quiver swell and sink
 Was it Earthquake or tobacco
 Day of Doom or Night of Drink

 In the full fresh fragrant morning
 I observed a camel crawl
 Laws of gravitation scorning
 On the ceiling and the wall
 Then I watched a fender walking
 And I heard grey leeches sing
 And a redhot monkey talking
 Did not seem the proper thing

 Then a Creature skinned and crimson
 Ran about the floor and cried
 And they said that I had the jims on
 And they dosed me with bromide
 And they locked me in my bedroom
 Me and one wee Blood Red Mouse
 Though I said To give my head room
 You had best unroof the house

 But my words were all unheeded
 Though I told the grave MD
 That the treatment really needed
 Was a dip in open sea
 That was lapping just below me
 Smooth as silver white as snow
 And it took three men to throw me
 When I found I could not go

 Half the night I watched the Heavens
 Fizz like 81 champagne
 Fly to sixes and to sevens
 Wheel and thunder back again
 And when all was peace and order
 Save one planet nailed askew
 Much I wept because my warder
 Would not let me set it true

 After frenzied hours of waiting
 When the Earth and Skies were dumb
 Pealed an awful voice dictating
 An interminable sum
 Changing to a tangle story
 What she said you said I said
 Till the Moon arose in glory
 And I found her in my head

 Then a Face came blind and weeping
 And It couldnt wipe its eyes
 And It muttered I was keeping
 Back the moonlight from the skies
 So I patted it for pity
 But it whistled shrill with wrath
 And a huge black Devil City
 Poured its peoples on my path

 So I fled with steps uncertain
 On a thousandyear long race
 But the bellying of the curtain
 Kept me always in one place
 While the tumult rose and maddened
 To the roar of Earth on fire
 Ere it ebbed and sank and saddened
 To a whisper tense as wire

 In tolerable stillness
 Rose one little little star
 And it chuckled at my illness
 And it mocked me from afar
 And its brethren came and eyed me
 Called the Universe to aid
 Till I lay with naught to hide me
 Neath the Scorn of All Things Made

 Dun and saffron robed and splendid
 Broke the solemn pitying Day
 And I knew my pains were ended
 And I turned and tried to pray
 But my speech was shattered wholly
 And I wept as children weep

 Till the dawnwind softly slowly
 Brought to burning eyelids sleep




MY RIVAL

 I go to concert party ball
 What profit is in these
 I sit alone against the wall
 And strive to look at ease

 The incense that is mine by right
 They burn before her shrine
 And thats because Im seventeen
 And She is fortynine

 I cannot check my girlish blush
 My color comes and goes
 I redden to my fingertips
 And sometimes to my nose

 But She is white where white should be
 And red where red should shine
 The blush that flies at seventeen
 Is fixed at fortynine

 I wish I had Her constant cheek
 I wish that I could sing
 All sorts of funny little songs
 Not quite the proper thing

 Im very gauche and very shy
 Her jokes arent in my line
 And worst of all Im seventeen
 While She is fortynine

 The young men come the young men go
 Each pink and white and neat
 Shes older than their mothers but
 They grovel at Her feet

 They walk beside Her rickshaw wheels
 None ever walk by mine
 And thats because Im seventeen
 And She is fortynine

 She rides with half a dozen men
 She calls them boys and mashers
 I trot along the Mall alone
 My prettiest frocks and sashes
 Dont help to fill my programmecard
 And vainly I repine
 From ten to two AM Ah me
 Would I were fortynine

 She calls me darling pet and dear
 And sweet retiring maid
 Im always at the back I know
 She puts me in the shade

 She introduces me to men
 Cast lovers I opine
 For sixty takes to seventeen
 Nineteen to fortynine

 But even She must older grow
 And end Her dancing days
 She cant go on forever so
 At concerts balls and plays

 One ray of priceless hope I see
 Before my footsteps shine
 Just think that Shell be eightyone
 When I am fortynine




THE LOVERS LITANY

 Eyes of greya sodden quay
 Driving rain and falling tears
 As the steamer wears to sea
 In a parting storm of cheers

 Sing for Faith and Hope are high
 None so true as you and I
 Sing the Lovers Litany
 Love like ours can never die

 Eyes of blacka throbbing keel
 Milky foam to left and right
 Whispered converse near the wheel
 In the brilliant tropic night

 Cross that rules the Southern Sky
 Stars that sweep and wheel and fly
 Hear the Lovers Litany
 Love like ours can never die

 Eyes of browna dusty plain
 Split and parched with heat of June
 Flying hoof and tightened rein
 Hearts that beat the old old tune

 Side by side the horses fly
 Frame we now the old reply
 Of the Lovers Litany
 Love like ours can never die

 Eyes of bluethe Simla Hills
 Silvered with the moonlight hoar
 Pleading of the waltz that thrills
 Dies and echoes round Benmore

 Mabel Officers Goodbye
 Glamour wine and witchery
 On my souls sincerity
 Love like ours can never die

 Maidens of your charity
 Pity my most luckless state
 Four times Cupids debtor I
 Bankrupt in quadruplicate

 Yet despite this evil case
 And a maiden showed me grace
 Fourandforty times would I
 Sing the Lovers Litany
 Love like ours can never die




A BALLAD OF BURIAL

 Saint Proxeds ever was the Church for peace

 If down here I chance to die
 Solemnly I beg you take
 All that is left of I
 To the Hills for old sakes sake
 Pack me very thoroughly
 In the ice that used to slake
 Pegs I drank when I was dry
 This observe for old sakes sake

 To the railway station hie
 There a single ticket take
 For UmballagoodstrainI
 Shall not mind delay or shake

 I shall rest contentedly
 Spite of clamor coolies make
 Thus in state and dignity
 Send me up for old sakes sake

 Next the sleepy Babu wake
 Book a Kalka van for four
 Few I think will care to make
 Journeys with me any more
 As they used to do of yore

 I shall need a special break
 Thing I never took before
 Get me one for old sakes sake

 After thatarrangements make

 No hotel will take me in
 And a bullocks back would break
 Neath the teak and leaden skin
 Tonga ropes are frail and thin
 Or did I a backseat take
 In a tonga I might spin
 Do your best for old sakes sake

 After thatyour work is done

 Recollect a Padre must
 Mourn the dear departed one
 Throw the ashes and the dust

 Dont go down at once I trust
 You will find excuse to snake
 Three days casual on the bust
 Get your fun for old sakes sake

 I could never stand the Plains
 Think of blazing June and May
 Think of those September rains
 Yearly till the Judgment Day
 I should never rest in peace
 I should sweat and lie awake

 Rail me then on my decease
 To the Hills for old sakes sake




DIVIDED DESTINIES

 It was an artless Bandar and he danced upon a pine
 And much I wondered how he lived and where the beast might dine
 And many many other things till oer my morning smoke
 I slept the sleep of idleness and dreamt that Bandar spoke

 He said O man of many clothes Sad crawler on the Hills
 Observe I know not Rankens shop nor Rankens monthly bills
 I take no heed to trousers or the coats that you call dress
 Nor am I plagued with little cards for little drinks at Mess

 I steal the bunnias grain at morn at noon and eventide
 For he is fat and I am spare I roam the mountain side
 I follow no mans carriage and no never in my life
 Have I flirted at Pelitis with another Bandars wife

 O man of futile fopperiesunnecessary wraps
 I own no ponies in the hills I drive no tallwheeled traps
 I buy me not twelvebutton gloves shortsixes eke or rings
 Nor do I waste at Hamiltons my wealth on pretty things

 I quarrel with my wife at home we never fight abroad
 But Mrs B has grasped the fact I am her only lord

 I never heard of feverdumps nor debts depress my soul
 And I pity and despise you Here he poached my breakfastroll

 His hide was very mangy and his face was very red
 And ever and anon he scratched with energy his head
 His manners were not always nice but how my spirit cried
 To be an artless Bandar loose upon the mountain side

 So I answered Gentle Bandar an inscrutable Decree
 Makes thee a gleesome fleasome Thou and me a wretched Me
 Go Depart in peace my brother to thy home amid the pine
 Yet forget not once a mortal wished to change his lot for thine

 Our cattle reel beneath the yoke they bear
 The earth is iron and the skies are brass
 And faint with fervour of the flaming air
 The languid hours pass

 The young wheat withers ere it reach a span
 And belts of blinding sand show cruelly
 Where once the river ran

 Chorus of the Crystallised Facts

 Before the beginning of years
 There came to the rule of the State
 Men with a pair of shears
 Men with an Estimate
 Strachey with Muir for leaven
 Lytton with locks that fell
 Ripon fooling with Heaven
 And Temple riding like Hll
 And the bigots took in hand
 Cess and the falling of rain
 And the measure of sifted sand
 The dealer puts in the grain
 Imports by land and sea
 To uttermost decimal worth
 And registrationfree
 In the houses of death and of birth

 And fashioned with pens and paper
 And fashioned in black and white
 With Life for a flickering taper
 And Death for a blazing light
 With the Armed and the Civil Power
 That his strength might endure for a span
 From Adams Bridge to Peshawur
 The Much Administered Man

 In the towns of the North and the East
 They gathered as unto rule
 They bade him starve his priest
 And send his children to school

 Railways and roads they wrought
 For the needs of the soil within
 A time to squabble in court
 A time to bear and to grin

 And gave him peace in his ways
 Jailsand Police to fight
 Justiceat length of days
 And Rightand Might in the Right

 His speech is of mortgaged bedding
 On his kine he borrows yet
 At his heart is his daughters wedding
 In his eye foreknowledge of debt

 He eats and hath indigestion
 He toils and he may not stop
 His life is a longdrawn question
 Between a crop and a crop




THE MARES NEST

 Jane Austen Beecher Stowe de Rouse
 Was good beyond all earthly need
 But on the other hand her spouse
 Was very very bad indeed

 He smoked cigars called churches slow
 And racedbut this she did not know

 For Belial Machiavelli kept
 The little fact a secret and
 Though oer his minor sins she wept
 Jane Austen did not understand
 That Lillythirteentwo and bay
 Absorbed onehalf her husbands pay

 She was so good she made him worse
 Some women are like this I think
 He taught her parrot how to curse
 Her Assam monkey how to drink

 He vexed her righteous soul until
 She went up and he went down hill

 Then came the crisis strange to say
 Which turned a good wife to a better

 A telegraphic peon one day
 Brought hernow had it been a letter
 For Belial Machiavelli I
 Know Jane would just have let it lie

 But twas a telegram instead
 Marked urgent and her duty plain
 To open it Jane Austen read
 Your Lillys got a cough again
 Cant understand why she is kept
 At your expense Jane Austen wept

 It was a misdirected wire
 Her husband was at Shaitanpore
 She spread her anger hot as fire
 Through six thin foreign sheets or more

 Sent off that letter wrote another
 To her solicitorand mother

 Then Belial Machiavelli saw
 Her error and I trust his own
 Wired to the minion of the Law
 And traveled wifewardnot alone

 For Lillythirteentwo and bay
 Came in a horsebox all the way

 There was a scenea weep or two
 With many kisses Austen Jane
 Rode Lilly all the season through
 And never opened wires again

 She races now with Belial This
 Is very sad but so it is




POSSIBILITIES

 Ay lay him neath the Simla pine
 A fortnight fully to be missed
 Behold we lose our fourth at whist
 A chair is vacant where we dine

 His place forgets him other men
 Have bought his ponies guns and traps
 His fortune is the Great Perhaps
 And that cool resthouse down the glen

 Whence he shall hear as spirits may
 Our mundane revel on the height
 Shall watch each flashing rickshawlight
 Sweep on to dinner dance and play

 Benmore shall woo him to the ball
 With lighted rooms and braying band
 And he shall hear and understand
 Dream Faces better than us all

 For think you as the vapours flee
 Across Sanjaolie after rain
 His soul may climb the hill again
 To each field of victory

 Unseen who women held so dear
 The strong mans yearning to his kind
 Shall shake at most the windowblind
 Or dull awhile the cardrooms cheer

 In his own place of power unknown
 His Light o Love anothers flame
 And he an alien and alone

 Yet may he meet with many a friend
 Shrewd shadows lingering long unseen
 Among us when God save the Queen
 Shows even extras have an end

 And when we leave the heated room
 And when at four the lights expire
 The crew shall gather round the fire
 And mock our laughter in the gloom

 Talk as we talked and they ere death
 Flirt wanly dance in ghostlywise
 With ghosts of tunes for melodies
 And vanish at the mornings breath




CHRISTMAS IN INDIA

 Dim dawn behind the tamarisksthe sky is saffronyellow
 As the women in the village grind the corn
 And the parrots seek the riverside each calling to his fellow
 That the Day the staring Easter Day is born

 Oh the white dust on the highway Oh the stenches in the byway
 Oh the clammy fog that hovers oer the earth
 And at Home theyre making merry neath the white and scarlet berry
 What part have Indias exiles in their mirth

 Full day behind the tamarisksthe sky is blue and staring
 As the cattle crawl afield beneath the yoke
 And they bear One oer the fieldpath who is past all hope or caring
 To the ghat below the curling wreaths of smoke

 Call on Rama going slowly as ye bear a brother lowly
 Call on Ramahe may hear perhaps your voice
 With our hymnbooks and our psalters we appeal to other altars
 And today we bid good Christian men rejoice

 High noon behind the tamarisksthe sun is hot above us
 As at Home the Christmas Day is breaking wan
 They will drink our healths at dinnerthose who tell us how they love us
 And forget us till another year be gone

 Oh the toil that knows no breaking Oh the Heimweh ceaseless aching
 Oh the black dividing Sea and alien Plain
 Youth was cheapwherefore we sold it
 Gold was goodwe hoped to hold it
 And today we know the fulness of our gain

 Grey dusk behind the tamarisksthe parrots fly together
 As the sun is sinking slowly over Home
 And his last ray seems to mock us shackled in a lifelong tether
 That drags us back howeer so far we roam

 Hard her service poor her paymentshe is ancient tattered raiment
 India she the grim Stepmother of our kind
 If a year of life be lent her if her temples shrine we enter
 The door is shutwe may not look behind

 Black night behind the tamarisksthe owls begin their chorus
 As the conches from the temple scream and bray
 With the fruitless years behind us and the hopeless years before us
 Let us honor O my brother Christmas Day

 Call a truce then to our laborslet us feast with friends and
 neighbors
 And be merry as the custom of our caste
 For if faint and forced the laughter and if sadness follow after
 We are richer by one mocking Christmas past




PAGETT MP

 The toad beneath the harrow knows
 Exactly where each toothpoint goes
 The butterfly upon the road
 Preaches contentment to that toad

 Pagett MP was a liar and a fluent liar therewith
 He spoke of the heat of India as the Asian Solar Myth
 Came on a four months visit to study the East in November
 And I got him to sign an agreement vowing to stay till September

 March came in with the koil Pagett was cool and gay
 Called me a bloated Brahmin talked of my princely pay
 March went out with the roses Where is your heat said he
 Coming said I to Pagett Skittles said Pagett MP

 April began with the punkah coolies and pricklyheat
 Pagett was dear to mosquitoes sandflies found him a treat
 He grew speckled and mumpyhammered I grieve to say
 Aryan brothers who fanned him in an illiberal way

 May set in with a duststormPagett went down with the sun
 All the delights of the season tickled him one by one
 Imprimisten days liverdue to his drinking beer
 Later a dose of feverslight but he called it severe

 Dysentry touched him in June after the Chota Bursat
 Lowered his portly personmade him yearn to depart
 He didnt call me a Brahmin or bloated or overpaid
 But seemed to think it a wonder that any one stayed

 July was a trifle unhealthyPagett was ill with fear
 Called it the Cholera Morbus hinted that life was dear
 He babbled of Eastern Exile and mentioned his home with tears
 But I havent seen my children for close upon seven years

 We reached a hundred and twenty once in the Court at noon
 Ive mentioned Pagett was portly Pagett went off in a swoon
 That was an end to the business Pagett the perjured fled
 With a practical working knowledge of Solar Myths in his head

 And I laughed as I drove from the station but the mirth died out on my lips
 As I thought of the fools like Pagett who write of their Eastern trips
 And the sneers of the traveled idiots who duly misgovern the land
 And I prayed to the Lord to deliver another one into my hand




THE SONG OF THE WOMEN

 How shall she know the worship we would do her
 The walls are high and she is very far
 How shall the womans message reach unto her
 Above the tumult of the packed bazaar
 Free wind of March against the lattice blowing
 Bear thou our thanks lest she depart unknowing

 Go forth across the fields we may not roam in
 Go forth beyond the trees that rim the city
 To whatsoeer fair place she hath her home in
 Who dowered us with wealth of love and pity
 Out of our shadow pass and seek her singing
 I have no gifts but Love alone for bringing

 Say that we be a feeble folk who greet her
 But old in grief and very wise in tears
 Say that we being desolate entreat her
 That she forget us not in after years
 For we have seen the light and it were grievous
 To dim that dawning if our lady leave us

 By life that ebbed with none to stanch the failing
 By Loves sad harvest garnered in the spring
 When Love in ignorance wept unavailing
 Oer young buds dead before their blossoming
 By all the grey owl watched the pale moon viewed
 In past grim years declare our gratitude

 By hands uplifted to the Gods that heard not
 By fits that found no favor in their sight
 By faces bent above the babe that stirred not
 By nameless horrors of the stifling night
 By ills foredone by peace her toils discover
 Bid Earth be good beneath and Heaven above her

 If she have sent her servants in our pain
 If she have fought with Death and dulled his sword
 If she have given back our sick again
 And to the breast the waking lips restored
 Is it a little thing that she has wrought
 Then Life and Death and Motherhood be nought

 Go forth O wind our message on thy wings
 And they shall hear thee pass and bid thee speed
 In reedroofed hut or whitewalled home of kings
 Who have been helpen by her in their need

 All spring shall give thee fragrance and the wheat
 Shall be a tasselled floorcloth to thy feet

 Haste for our hearts are with thee take no rest
 Loudvoiced ambassador from sea to sea
 Proclaim the blessing manifold confessed
 Of those in darkness by her hand set free

 Then very softly to her presence move
 And whisper Lady lo they know and love




A BALLAD OF JAKKO HILL

 One moment bid the horses wait
 Since tiffin is not laid till three
 Below the upward path and straight
 You climbed a year ago with me

 Love came upon us suddenly
 And loosedan idle hour to kill
 A headless armless armory
 That smote us both on Jakko Hill

 Ah Heaven we would wait and wait
 Through Time and to Eternity
 Ah Heaven we could conquer Fate
 With more than Godlike constancy
 I cut the date upon a tree
 Here stand the clumsy figures still
 10785 AD
 Damp with the mist of Jakko Hill

 What came of high resolve and great
 And until Death fidelity
 Whose horse is waiting at your gate
 Whose rickshawwheels ride over me
 No Saints I swear andlet me see
 Tonight what names your programme fill
 We drift asunder merrily
 As drifts the mist on Jakko Hill

 LENVOI

 Princess behold our ancient state
 Has clean departed and we see
 Twas Idleness we took for Fate
 That bound light bonds on you and me

 Amen Here ends the comedy
 Where it began in all good will
 Since Love and Leave together flee
 As driven mist on Jakko Hill




THE PLEA OF THE SIMLA DANCERS

 Too late alas the song
 To remedy the wrong
 The rooms are taken from us swept and
 garnished for their fate
 But these tearbesprinkled pages
 Shall attest to future ages
 That we cried against the crime of it
 too late alas too late

 What have we ever done to bear this grudge
 Was there no room save only in Benmore
 For docket duftar and for office drudge
 That you usurp our smoothest dancing floor
 Must babus do their work on polished teak
 Are ballrooms fittest for the ink you spill
 Was there no other cheaper house to seek
 You might have left them all at Strawberry Hill

 We never harmed you Innocent our guise
 Dainty our shining feet our voices low
 And we revolved to divers melodies
 And we were happy but a year ago

 Tonight the moon that watched our lightsome wiles
 That beamed upon us through the deodars
 Is wan with gazing on official files
 And desecrating desks disgust the stars

 Nay by the memory of tuneful nights
 Nay by the witchery of flying feet
 Nay by the glamour of foredone delights
 By all things merry musical and meet
 By wine that sparkled and by sparkling eyes
 By wailing waltzby reckless galops strain
 By dim verandas and by soft replies
 Give us our ravished ballroom back again

 Orhearken to the curse we lay on you
 The ghosts of waltzes shall perplex your brain
 And murmurs of past merriment pursue
 Your wildered clerks that they indite in vain
 And when you count your poor Provincial millions
 The only figures that your pen shall frame
 Shall be the figures of dear dear cotillions
 Danced out in tumult long before you came

 Yea See Saw shall upset your estimates
 Dream Faces shall your heavy heads bemuse
 Because your hand unheeding desecrates
 Our temple fit for higher worthier use
 And all the long verandas eloquent
 With echoes of a score of Simla years
 Shall plague you with unbidden sentiment
 Babbling of kisses laughter love and tears

 So shall you mazed amid old memories stand
 So shall you toil and shall accomplish nought
 And ever in your ears a phantom Band
 Shall blare away the staid official thought

 Whereforeand ere this awful curse he spoken
 Cast out your swarthy sacrilegious train
 And giveere dancing cease and hearts be broken
 Give us our ravished ballroom back again




THE BALLAD OF FISHERS BOARDINGHOUSE

 That night when through the mooringchains
 The wideeyed corpse rolled free
 To blunder down by Garden Reach
 And rot at Kedgeree
 The tale the Hughli told the shoal
 The lean shoal told to me

 T was Fultah Fishers boardinghouse
 Where sailormen reside
 And there were men of all the ports
 From Mississip to Clyde
 And regally they spat and smoked
 And fearsomely they lied

 They lied about the purple Sea
 That gave them scanty bread
 They lied about the Earth beneath
 The Heavens overhead
 For they had looked too often on
 Black rum when that was red

 They told their tales of wreck and wrong
 Of shame and lust and fraud
 They backed their toughest statements with
 The Brimstone of the Lord
 And crackling oaths went to and fro
 Across the fistbanged board

 And there was Hans the blueeyed Dane
 Bullthroated bare of arm
 Who carried on his hairy chest
 The maid Ultrudas charm
 The little silver crucifix
 That keeps a man from harm

 And there was Jake WithouttheEars
 And Pamba the Malay
 And Carboy Gin the Guinea cook
 And Luz from Vigo Bay
 And Honest Jack who sold them slops
 And harvested their pay

 And there was Salem Hardieker
 A lean Bostonian he
 Russ German English Halfbreed Finn
 Yank Dane and Portuguee
 At Fultah Fishers boardinghouse
 They rested from the sea

 Now Anne of Austria shared their drinks
 Collinga knew her fame
 From Tarnau in Galicia
 To Juan Bazaar she came
 To eat the bread of infamy
 And take the wage of shame

 She held a dozen men to heel
 Rich spoil of war was hers
 In hose and gown and ring and chain
 From twenty mariners
 And by Port Law that week men called
 her Salem Hardiekers

 But seamen learntwhat landsmen know
 That neither gifts nor gain
 Can hold a winking Light o Love
 Or Fancys flight restrain
 When Anne of Austria rolled her eyes
 On Hans the blueeyed Dane

 Since Life is strife and strife means knife
 From Howrah to the Bay
 And he may die before the dawn
 Who liquored out the day
 In Fultah Fishers boardinghouse
 We woo while yet we may

 But cold was Hans the blueeyed Dane
 Bullthroated bare of arm
 And laughter shook the chest beneath
 The maid Ultrudas charm
 The little silver crucifix
 That keeps a man from harm

 You speak to Salem Hardieker
 You was his girl I know

 I ship mineselfs tomorrow see
 Und round the Skaw we go
 South down the Cattegat by Hjelm
 To Besser in Saro

 When love rejected turns to hate
 All ill betide the man

 You speak to Salem Hardieker
 She spoke as woman can
 A screama sobHe called menames
 And then the fray began

 An oath from Salem Hardieker
 A shriek upon the stairs
 A dance of shadows on the wall
 A knifethrust unawares
 And Hans came down as cattle drop
 Across the broken chairs
      

 In Anne of Austrias trembling hands
 The weary head fell low
 I ship mineselfs tomorrow straight
 For Besser in Saro
 Und there Ultruda comes to me
 At Easter und I go

 South down the CattegatWhats here
 Therearenolightsto guide
 The mutter ceased the spirit passed
 And Anne of Austria cried
 In Fultah Fishers boardinghouse
 When Hans the mighty died

 Thus slew they Hans the blueeyed Dane
 Bullthroated bare of arm
 But Anne of Austria looted first
 The maid Ultrudas charm
 The little silver crucifix
 That keeps a man from harm




AS THE BELL CLINKS

 As I left the Halls at Lumley rose the vision of a comely
 Maid last season worshipped dumbly watched with fervor from afar
 And I wondered idly blindly if the maid would greet me kindly

 That was allthe rest was settled by the clinking tongabar
 Yea my life and hers were coupled by the tonga couplingbar

 For my misty meditation at the second changinstation
 Suffered sudden dislocation fled before the tuneless jar
 Of a Wagner obbligato scherzo doublehand staccato
 Played on either ponys saddle by the clacking tongabar

 Played with human speech I fancied by the jigging jolting bar

 She was sweet thought I last season but twere surely wild unreason
 Such tiny hope to freeze on as was offered by my Star
 When she whispered something sadly Iwe feel your going badly
 And you let the chance escape you rapped the rattling tongabar

 What a chance and what an idiot clicked the vicious tongabar

 Heart of manoh heart of putty Had I gone by Kakahutti
 On the old Hillroad and rutty I had scaped that fatal car
 But his fortune each must bide by so I watched the milestones slide by
 To You call on Her tomorrowfugue with cymbals by the bar

 You must call on Her tomorrowposthorn gallop by the bar

 Yet a further stage my goal onwe were whirling down to Solon
 With a double lurch and roll on best foot foremost ganz und gar
 She was very sweet I hinted If a kiss had been imprinted
 Would ha saved a world of trouble clashed the busy tongabar

 Been accepted or rejected banged and clanged the tongabar

 Then a notion wild and daring spite the income taxs paring
 And a hasty thought of sharingless than many incomes are
 Made me put a question private you can guess what I would drive at
 You must work the sum to prove it clanked the careless tongabar

 Simple Rule of Two will prove it lilted back the tongabar

 It was under Khyraghaut I mused Suppose the maid be haughty
 There are lovers richand rottywait some wealthy Avatar
 Answer monitor untiring twixt the ponies twain perspiring
 Faint heart never won fair lady creaked the straining tongabar

 Can I tell you ere you ask Her pounded slow the tongabar

 Last the Tara Devi turning showed the lights of Simla burning
 Lit my little lazy yearning to a fiercer flame by far

 As below the Mall we jingled through my very heart it tingled
 Did the iterated order of the threshing tongabar

 Try your luckyou cant do better twanged the loosened tongabar




AN OLD SONG

 So long as neath the Kalka hills
 The tongahorn shall ring
 So long as down the Solon dip
 The hardheld ponies swing
 So long as Tara Devi sees
 The lights of Simla town
 So long as Pleasure calls us up
 Or Duty drives us down
 If you love me as I love you
 What pair so happy as we two

 So long as Aces take the King
 Or backers take the bet
 So long as debt leads men to wed
 Or marriage leads to debt
 So long as little luncheons Love
 And scandal hold their vogue
 While there is sport at Annandale
 Or whisky at Jutogh
 If you love me as I love you
 What knife can cut our love in two

 So long as down the rocking floor
 The raving polka spins
 So long as Kitchen Lancers spur
 The maddened violins
 So long as through the whirling smoke
 We hear the ofttold tale
 Twelve hundred in the Lotteries
 And Whatshername for sale
 If you love me as I love you
 Well play the game and win it too

 So long as Lust or Lucre tempt
 Straight riders from the course
 So long as with each drink we pour
 Black brewage of Remorse
 So long as those unloaded guns
 We keep beside the bed
 Blow off by obvious accident
 The lucky owners head
 If you love me as I love you
 What can Life kill or Death undo

 So long as Death twixt dance and dance
 Chills best and bravest blood
 And drops the reckless rider down
 The rotten rainsoaked khud
 So long as rumours from the North
 Make loving wives afraid
 So long as Burma takes the boy
 Or typhoid kills the maid
 If you love me as I love you
 What knife can cut our love in two

 By all that lights our daily life
 Or works our lifelong woe
 From Boileaugunge to Simla Downs
 And those grim glades below
 Where heedless of the flying hoof
 And clamour overhead
 Sleep with the grey langur for guard
 Our very scornful Dead
 If you love me as I love you
 All Earth is servant to us two

 By Docket Billetdoux and File
 By Mountain Cliff and Fir
 By Fan and Sword and Officebox
 By Corset Plume and Spur
 By Riot Revel Waltz and War
 By Women Work and Bills
 By all the life that fizzes in
 The everlasting Hills
 If you love me as I love you
 What pair so happy as we two




CERTAIN MAXIMS OF HAFIZ

 I
 If It be pleasant to look on stalled in the packed serai
 Does not the Young Man try Its temper and pace ere he buy
 If She be pleasant to look on what does the Young Man say
 Lo She is pleasant to look on give Her to me today

 II
 Yea though a Kafir die to him is remitted Jehannum
 If he borrowed in life from a native at sixty per cent per annum

 III
 Blister we not for bursati So when the heart is vexed
 The pain of one maidens refusal is drowned in the pain of the next

 IV
 The temper of chums the love of your wife and a new pianos tune
 Which of the three will you trust at the end of an Indian June

 V
 Who are the rulers of Indto whom shall we bow the knee
 Make your peace with the women and men will make you L G

 VI
 Does the woodpecker flit round the young ferash
 Does grass clothe a newbuilt wall
 Is she under thirty the woman who holds a boy in her thrall

 VII
 If She grow suddenly graciousreflect Is it all for thee
 The blackbuck is stalked through the bullock and Man through jealousy

 VIII
 Seek not for favor of women So shall you find it indeed
 Does not the boar break cover just when youre lighting a weed

 IX
 If He play being young and unskilful for shekels of silver and gold
 Take his money my son praising Allah The kid was ordained to be sold

 X
 With a weed among men or horses verily this is the best
 That you work him in office or dogcart lightlybut give him no rest

 XI
 Pleasant the snaffle of Courtship improving the manners and carriage
 But the colt who is wise will abstain from the terrible thornbit of Marriage

 XII
 As the thriftless gold of the babul so is the gold that we spend
 On a derby Sweep or our neighbors wife or the horse that we buy from a
 friend

 XIII
 The ways of man with a maid be strange yet simple and tame
 To the ways of a man with a horse when selling or racing that same

 XIV
 In public Her face turneth to thee and pleasant Her smile when ye meet
 It is ill The cold rocks of ElGidar smile thus on the waves at their feet

 In public Her face is averted with anger She nameth thy name
 It is well Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game

 XV
 If She have spoken a word remember thy lips are sealed
 And the Brand of the Dog is upon him by whom is the secret revealed

 If She have written a letter delay not an instant but burn it
 Tear it to pieces O Fool and the wind to her mate shall return it

 If there be trouble to Herward and a lie of the blackest can clear
 Lie while thy lips can move or a man is alive to hear

 XVI
 My Son if a maiden deny thee and scufflingly bid thee give oer
 Yet lip meets with lip at the last wordget out
 She has been there before
 They are pecked on the ear and the chin and the nose who are lacking in lore

 XVII
 If we fall in the race though we win the hoofslide is scarred on the
 course
 Though Allah and Earth pardon Sin remaineth forever Remorse

 XVIII
 By all I am misunderstood if the Matron shall say or the Maid
 Alas I do not understand my son be thou nowise afraid

 In vain in the sight of the Bird is the net of the Fowler displayed

 XIX
 My son if I Hafiz the father take hold of thy knees in my pain
 Demanding thy name on stamped paper one day or one hourrefrain

 Are the links of thy fetters so light that thou cravest another mans chain




THE GRAVE OF THE HUNDRED HEAD

 Theres a widow in sleepy Chester
 Who weeps for her only son
 Theres a grave on the Pabeng River
 A grave that the Burmans shun
 And theres Subadar Prag Tewarri
 Who tells how the work was done

 A Snider squibbed in the jungle
 Somebody laughed and fled
 And the men of the First Shikaris
 Picked up their Subaltern dead
 With a big blue mark in his forehead
 And the back blown out of his head

 Subadar Prag Tewarri
 Jemadar Hira Lal
 Took command of the party
 Twenty rifles in all
 Marched them down to the river
 As the day was beginning to fall

 They buried the boy by the river
 A blanket over his face
 They wept for their dead Lieutenant
 The men of an alien race
 They made a samadh in his honor
 A mark for his restingplace

 For they swore by the Holy Water
 They swore by the salt they ate
 That the soul of Lieutenant Eshmitt Sahib
 Should go to his God in state
 With fifty file of Burman
 To open him Heavens gate

 The men of the First Shikaris
 Marched till the break of day
 Till they came to the rebel village
 The village of Pabengmay
 A jingal covered the clearing
 Calthrops hampered the way

 Subadar Prag Tewarri
 Bidding them load with ball
 Halted a dozen rifles
 Under the village wall
 Sent out a flankingparty
 With Jemadar Hira Lal

 The men of the First Shikaris
 Shouted and smote and slew
 Turning the grinning jingal
 On to the howling crew
 The Jemadars flankingparty
 Butchered the folk who flew

 Long was the morn of slaughter
 Long was the list of slain
 Five score heads were taken
 Five score heads and twain
 And the men of the First Shikaris
 Went back to their grave again

 Each man bearing a basket
 Red as his palms that day
 Red as the blazing village
 The village of Pabengmay
 And the dripdripdrip from the baskets
 Reddened the grass by the way

 They made a pile of their trophies
 High as a tall mans chin
 Head upon head distorted
 Set in a sightless grin
 Anger and pain and terror
 Stamped on the smokescorched skin

 Subadar Prag Tewarri
 Put the head of the Boh
 On the top of the mound of triumph
 The head of his son below
 With the sword and the peacockbanner
 That the world might behold and know

 Thus the samadh was perfect
 Thus was the lesson plain
 Of the wrath of the First Shikaris
 The price of a white man slain
 And the men of the First Shikaris
 Went back into camp again

 Then a silence came to the river
 A hush fell over the shore
 And Bohs that were brave departed
 And Sniders squibbed no more
 For the Burmans said
 That a kullahs head
 Must be paid for with heads five score

 Theres a widow in sleepy Chester
 Who weeps for her only son
 Theres a grave on the Pabeng River
 A grave that the Burmans shun
 And theres Subadar Prag Tewarri
 Who tells how the work was done




THE MOON OF OTHER DAYS

 Beneath the deep verandas shade
 When bats begin to fly
 I sit me down and watchalas
 Another evening die

 Bloodred behind the sere ferash
 She rises through the haze
 Sainted Diana can that be
 The Moon of Other Days

 Ah shade of little Kitty Smith
 Sweet Saint of Kensington
 Say was it ever thus at Home
 The Moon of August shone
 When arm in arm we wandered long
 Through Putneys evening haze
 And Hammersmith was Heaven beneath
 The Moon of Other Days

 But Wandles stream is Sutlej now
 And Putneys evening haze
 The dust that half a hundred kine
 Before my window raise
 Unkempt unclean athwart the mist
 The seething city looms
 In place of Putneys golden gorse
 The sickly babul blooms

 Glare down old Hecate through the dust
 And bid the piedog yell
 Draw from the drain its typhoidgerm
 From each bazaar its smell
 Yea suck the fever from the tank
 And sap my strength therewith
 Thank Heaven you show a smiling face
 To little Kitty Smith




THE OVERLAND MAIL
 FootService to the Hills

 In the name of the Empress of India make way
 O Lords of the Jungle wherever you roam
 The woods are astir at the close of the day
 We exiles are waiting for letters from Home
 Let the robber retreatlet the tiger turn tail
 In the Name of the Empress the Overland Mail

 With a jingle of bells as the dusk gathers in
 He turns to the footpath that heads up the hill
 The bags on his back and a cloth round his chin
 And tucked in his waistbelt the Post Office bill
 Despatched on this date as received by the rail
 Per runner two bags of the Overland Mail

 Is the torrent in spate He must ford it or swim
 Has the rain wrecked the road He must climb by the cliff
 Does the tempest cry Halt What are tempests to him
 The Service admits not a but or and if
 While the breaths in his mouth he must bear without fail
 In the Name of the Empress the Overland Mail

 From aloe to roseoak from roseoak to fir
 From level to upland from upland to crest
 From ricefield to rockridge from rockridge to spur
 Fly the soft sandalled feet strains the brawny brown chest
 From rail to ravineto the peak from the vale
 Up up through the night goes the Overland Mail

 Theres a speck on the hillside a dot on the road
 A jingle of bells on the footpath below
 Theres a scuffle above in the monkeys abode
 The world is awake and the clouds are aglow

 For the great Sun himself must attend to the hail
 In the name of the Empress the Overland Mail




WHAT THE PEOPLE SAID
 June 21st 1887

 By the well where the bullocks go
 Silent and blind and slow
 By the field where the young corn dies
 In the face of the sultry skies
 They have heard as the dull Earth hears
 The voice of the wind of an hour
 The sound of the Great Queens voice
 My God hath given me years
 Hath granted dominion and power
 And I bid you O Land rejoice

 And the ploughman settles the share
 More deep in the grudging clod
 For he saith The wheat is my care
 And the rest is the will of God

 He sent the Mahratta spear
 As He sendeth the rain
 And the Mlech in the fated year
 Broke the spear in twain

 And was broken in turn Who knows
 How our Lords make strife
 It is good that the young wheat grows
 For the bread is Life

 Then far and near as the twilight drew
 Hissed up to the scornful dark
 Great serpents blazing of red and blue
 That rose and faded and rose anew

 That the Land might wonder and mark
 Today is a day of days they said
 Make merry O People all
 And the Ploughman listened and bowed his head
 Today and tomorrow Gods will he said
 As he trimmed the lamps on the wall

 He sendeth us years that are good
 As He sendeth the dearth
 He giveth to each man his food
 Or Her food to the Earth

 Our Kings and our Queens are afar
 On their peoples be peace
 God bringeth the rain to the Bar
 That our cattle increase

 And the Ploughman settled the share
 More deep in the sundried clod
 Mogul Mahratta and Mlech from the North
 And White Queen over the Seas
 God raiseth them up and driveth them forth
 As the dust of the ploughshare flies in the breeze
 But the wheat and the cattle are all my care
 And the rest is the will of God




THE UNDERTAKERS HORSE

 Totschinshu is condemned to death
 How can he drink tea with the Executioner
 Japanese Proverb

 The eldest son bestrides him
 And the pretty daughter rides him
 And I meet him oft o mornings on the Course
 And there kindles in my bosom
 An emotion chill and gruesome
 As I canter past the Undertakers Horse

 Neither shies he nor is restive
 But a hideously suggestive
 Trot professional and placid he affects
 And the cadence of his hoofbeats
 To my mind this grim reproof beats
 Mend your pace my friend Im coming Whos the next

 Ah studbred of illomen
 I have watched the strongest gomen
 Of pith and might and muscleat your heels
 Down the plantainbordered highway
 Heaven send it neer be my way
 In a lacquered box and jetty upon wheels

 Answer sombre beast and dreary
 Where is Brown the young the cheery
 Smith the pride of all his friends and half the Force
 You were at that last dread dak
 We must cover at a walk
 Bring them back to me O Undertakers Horse

 With your mane unhogged and flowing
 And your curious way of going
 And that businesslike black crimping of your tail
 Een with Beauty on your back Sir
 Pacing as a ladys hack Sir
 What wonder when I meet you I turn pale

 It may be you wait your time Beast
 Till I write my last bad rhyme Beast
 Quit the sunlight cut the rhyming drop the glass
 Follow after with the others
 Where some dusky heathen smothers
 Us with marigolds in lieu of English grass

 Or perchance in years to follow
 I shall watch your plump sides hollow
 See Carnifex gone lame become a corse
 See old age at last oerpower you
 And the Station Pack devour you
 I shall chuckle then O Undertakers Horse

 But to insult jibe and quest Ive
 Still the hideously suggestive
 Trot that hammers out the unrelenting text
 And I hear it hard behind me
 In what place soeer I find me
 Sure to catch you sooner or later Whos the next




THE FALL OF JOCK GILLESPIE

 This fell when dinnertime was done
 Twixt the first an the second rub
 That oor mon Jock cam hame again
 To his rooms ahist the Club

 An syne he laughed an syne he sang
 An syne we thocht him fou
 An syne he trumped his partners trick
 An garred his partner rue

 Then up and spake an elder mon
 That held the Spade its Ace
 God save the lad Whence comes the licht
 That wimples on his face

 An Jock he sniggered an Jock he smiled
 An ower the cardbrim wunk
 Im a too fresh fra the stirruppeg
 May be that I am drunk

 Theres whusky brewed in Galashils
 An L L L forbye
 But never liquor lit the lowe
 That keeks fra oot your eye

 Theres a third o hair on your dresscoat breast
 Aboon the heart a wee
 Oh that is fra the langhaired Skye
 That slobbers ower me

 Oh langhaired Skyes are lovin beasts
 An terrier dogs are fair
 But never yet was terrier born
 Wi elllang gowden hair

 Theres a smirch o pouther on your breast
 Below the left lappel
 Oh that is fra my auld cigar
 Whenas the stumpend fell

 Mon Jock ye smoke the Trichi coarse
 For ye are short o cash
 An best Havanas couldna leave
 Sae white an pure an ash

 This nicht ye stopped a story braid
 An stopped it wi a curse
 Last nicht ye told that tale yoursel
 An capped it wi a worse

 Oh were no fou Oh were no fou
 But plainly we can ken
 Yere fallin fallin fra the band
 O cantie single men

 An it fell when sirrisshaws were sere
 An the nichts were lang and mirk
 In braw new breeks wi a gowden ring
 Oor Jock gaed to the Kirk




ARITHMETIC ON THE FRONTIER

 A great and glorious thing it is
 To learn for seven years or so
 The Lord knows what of that and this
 Ere reckoned fit to face the foe
 The flying bullet down the Pass
 That whistles clear All flesh is grass

 Three hundred pounds per annum spent
 On making brain and body meeter
 For all the murderous intent
 Comprised in villainous saltpetre
 And afterask the Yusufzaies
 What comes of all our ologies

 A scrimmage in a Border Station
 A canter down some dark defile
 Two thousand pounds of education
 Drops to a tenrupee jezail
 The Crammers boast the Squadrons pride
 Shot like a rabbit in a ride

 No proposition Euclid wrote
 No formulae the textbooks know
 Will turn the bullet from your coat
 Or ward the tulwars downward blow
 Strike hard who caresshoot straight who can
 The odds are on the cheaper man

 One swordknot stolen from the camp
 Will pay for all the school expenses
 Of any Kurrum Valley scamp
 Who knows no word of moods and tenses
 But being blessed with perfect sight
 Picks off our messmates left and right

 With homebred hordes the hillsides teem
 The troopships bring us one by one
 At vast expense of time and steam
 To slay Afridis where they run

 The captives of our bow and spear
 Are cheapalas as we are dear




THE BETROTHED

 You must choose between me and your cigar
 BREACH OF PROMISE CASE CIRCA 1885

 Open the old cigarbox get me a Cuba stout
 For things are running crossways and Maggie and I are out

 We quarrelled about Havanaswe fought oer a good cheroot
 And I knew she is exacting and she says I am a brute

 Open the old cigarboxlet me consider a space
 In the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on Maggies face

 Maggie is pretty to look atMaggies a loving lass
 But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle the truest of loves must pass

 Theres peace in a Larranaga theres calm in a Henry Clay
 But the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away

 Thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown
 But I could not throw away Maggie for fear o the talk o the town

 Maggie my wife at fiftygrey and dour and old
 With never another Maggie to purchase for love or gold

 And the light of Days that have Been the dark of the Days that Are
 And Loves torch stinking and stale like the butt of a dead cigar

 The butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in your pocket
 With never a new one to light tho its charred and black to the socket

 Open the old cigarboxlet me consider a while
 Here is a mild Manilathere is a wifely smile

 Which is the better portionbondage bought with a ring
 Or a harem of dusky beauties fifty tied in a string

 Counsellors cunning and silentcomforters true and tried
 And never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride

 Thought in the early morning solace in time of woes
 Peace in the hush of the twilight balm ere my eyelids close

 This will the fifty give me asking nought in return
 With only a Suttees passionto do their duty and burn

 This will the fifty give me When they are spent and dead
 Five times other fifties shall be my servants instead

 The furrows of faroff Java the isles of the Spanish Main
 When they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again

 I will take no heed to their raiment nor food for their mouths withal
 So long as the gulls are nesting so long as the showers fall

 I will scent em with best vanilla with tea will I temper their hides
 And the Moor and the Mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides

 For Maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
 The wee little whimpering Love and the great god Nick o Teen

 And I have been servant of Love for barely a twelvemonth clear
 But I have been Priest of Cabanas a matter of seven year

 And the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
 Of stumps that I burned to Friendship and Pleasure and Work and Fight

 And I turn my eyes to the future that Maggie and I must prove
 But the only light on the marshes is the WillotheWisp of Love

 Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire
 Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it shall I follow the fitful fire

 Open the old cigarboxlet me consider anew
 Old friends and who is Maggie that I should abandon you

 A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke
 And a woman is only a woman but a good Cigar is a Smoke

 Light me another CubaI hold to my firstsworn vows
 If Maggie will have no rival Ill have no Maggie for Spouse




A TALE OF TWO CITIES

 Where the sobercolored cultivator smiles
 On his byles
 Where the cholera the cyclone and the crow
 Come and go
 Where the merchant deals in indigo and tea
 Hides and ghi
 Where the Babu drops inflammatory hints
 In his prints
 Stands a CityCharnock chose itpacked away
 Near a Bay
 By the Sewage rendered fetid by the sewer
 Made impure
 By the Sunderbunds unwholesome by the swamp
 Moist and damp
 And the City and the Viceroy as we see
 Dont agree

 Once two hundred years ago the trader came
 Meek and tame

 Where his timid foot first halted there he stayed
 Till mere trade
 Grew to Empire and he sent his armies forth
 South and North
 Till the country from Peshawur to Ceylon
 Was his own

 Thus the midday halt of Charnockmores the pity
 Grew a City

 As the fungus sprouts chaotic from its bed
 So it spread
 Chancedirected chanceerected laid and built
 On the silt
 Palace byre hovelpoverty and pride
 Side by side
 And above the packed and pestilential town
 Death looked down

 But the Rulers in that City by the Sea
 Turned to flee
 Fled with each returning springtide from its ills
 To the Hills

 From the clammy fogs of morning from the blaze
 Of old days
 From the sickness of the noontide from the heat
 Beat retreat
 For the country from Peshawur to Ceylon
 Was their own

 But the Merchant risked the perils of the Plain
 For his gain

 Now the restingplace of Charnock neath the palms
 Asks an alms
 And the burden of its lamentation is
 Briefly this
 Because for certain months we boil and stew
 So should you

 Cast the Viceroy and his Council to perspire
 In our fire
 And for answer to the argument in vain
 We explain
 That an amateur Saint Lawrence cannot fry
 All must fry
 That the Merchant risks the perils of the Plain
 For gain

 Nor can Rulers rule a house that men grow rich in
 From its kitchen

 Let the Babu drop inflammatory hints
 In his prints
 And matureconsistent soulhis plan for stealing
 To Darjeeling
 Let the Merchant seek who makes his silver pile
 Englands isle
 Let the City Charnock pitched onevil day
 Go Her way

 Though the argosies of Asia at Her doors
 Heap their stores
 Though Her enterprise and energy secure
 Income sure
 Though outstation orders punctually obeyed
 Swell Her trade
 Still for rule administration and the rest
 Simlas best

 The End
        




VOLUME II BALLADS AND BARRACKROOM BALLADS




BALLADS




THE BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST

 Oh East is East and West is West and never the twain shall
 meet
 Till Earth and Sky stand presently at Gods great Judgment
 Seat
 But there is neither East nor West Border nor Breed nor Birth
 When two strong men stand face to face
 tho they come from the ends of the earth

 Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Borderside
 And he has lifted the Colonels mare that is the Colonels pride
 He has lifted her out of the stabledoor between the dawn and the day
 And turned the calkins upon her feet and ridden her far away

 Then up and spoke the Colonels son that led a troop of the Guides
 Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides
 Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan the son of the Ressaldar
 If ye know the track of the morningmist ye know where his pickets are

 At dusk he harries the Abazaiat dawn he is into Bonair
 But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare
 So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly
 By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai

 But if he be past the Tongue of Jagai right swiftly turn ye then
 For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamals men
 There is rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between
 And ye may hear a breechbolt snick where never a man is seen

 The Colonels son has taken a horse and a raw rough dun was he
 With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell and the head of the gallows
 tree

 The Colonels son to the Fort has won they bid him stay to eat
 Who rides at the tail of a Border thief he sits not long at his meat

 Hes up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly
 Till he was aware of his fathers mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai
 Till he was aware of his fathers mare with Kamal upon her back
 And when he could spy the white of her eye he made the pistol crack

 He has fired once he has fired twice but the whistling ball went wide
 Ye shoot like a soldier Kamal said Show now if ye can ride

 Its up and over the Tongue of Jagai as blown dustdevils go
 The dun he fled like a stag of ten but the mare like a barren doe

 The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above
 But the red mare played with the snafflebars as a maiden plays with a glove

 There was rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between
 And thrice he heard a breechbolt snick tho never a man was seen

 They have ridden the low moon out of the sky their hoofs drum up the dawn
 The dun he went like a wounded bull but the mare like a newroused fawn

 The dun he fell at a watercoursein a woful heap fell he
 And Kamal has turned the red mare back and pulled the rider free

 He has knocked the pistol out of his handsmall room was there to strive
 Twas only by favour of mine quoth he ye rode so long alive
 There was not a rock for twenty mile there was not a clump of tree
 But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee

 If I had raised my bridlehand as I have held it low
 The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row
 If I had bowed my head on my breast as I have held it high
 The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly
 Lightly answered the Colonels son Do good to bird and beast
 But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast

 If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away
 Belike the price of a jackals meal were more than a thief could pay

 They will feed their horse on the standing crop their men on the garnered
 grain
 The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain

 But if thou thinkest the price be fairthy brethren wait to sup
 The hound is kin to the jackalspawnhowl dog and call them up
 And if thou thinkest the price be high in steer and gear and stack
 Give me my fathers mare again and Ill fight my own way back

 Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet
 No talk shall be of dogs said he when wolf and gray wolf meet

 May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath
 What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death
 Lightly answered the Colonels son I hold by the blood of my clan
 Take up the mare for my fathers giftby God she has carried a man
 The red mare ran to the Colonels son and nuzzled against his breast
 We be two strong men said Kamal then but she loveth the younger best

 So she shall go with a lifters dower my turquoisestudded rein
 My broidered saddle and saddlecloth and silver stirrups twain
 The Colonels son a pistol drew and held it muzzleend
 Ye have taken the one from a foe said he
 will ye take the mate from a friend
 A gift for a gift said Kamal straight a limb for the risk of a limb

 Thy father has sent his son to me Ill send my son to him
 With that he whistled his only son that dropped from a mountaincrest
 He trod the ling like a buck in spring and he looked like a lance in rest

 Now here is thy master Kamal said who leads a troop of the Guides
 And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides
 Till Death or I cut loose the tie at camp and board and bed
 Thy life is histhy fate it is to guard him with thy head

 So thou must eat the White Queens meat and all her foes are thine
 And thou must harry thy fathers hold for the peace of the Borderline
 And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power
 Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur

 They have looked each other between the eyes and there they found no fault
 They have taken the Oath of the BrotherinBlood on leavened bread and salt
 They have taken the Oath of the BrotherinBlood on fire and freshcut sod
 On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife and the Wondrous Names of God

 The Colonels son he rides the mare and Kamals boy the dun
 And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one

 And when they drew to the QuarterGuard full twenty swords flew clear
 There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer

 Ha done ha done said the Colonels son
 Put up the steel at your sides
 Last night ye had struck at a Border thief
 tonight tis a man of the Guides

 Oh East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet
 Till Earth and Sky stand presently at Gods great Judgment Seat
 But there is neither East nor West Border nor Breed nor Birth
 When two strong men stand face to face
 tho they come from the ends of the earth




THE LAST SUTTEE

 Not many years ago a King died in one of the Rajpoot States His wives
 disregarding the orders of the English against Suttee would have broken out
 of the palace had not the gates been barred

 But one of them disguised as the Kings favourite dancinggirl passed
 through the line of guards and reached the pyre There her courage failing
 she prayed her cousin a baron of the court to kill her This he did not
 knowing who she was




Udai Chand lay sick to death
 In his hold by Gungra hill
 All night we heard the deathgongs ring
 For the soul of the dying Rajpoot King
 All night beat up from the womens wing
 A cry that we could not still

 All night the barons came and went
 The lords of the outer guard
 All night the cressets glimmered pale
 On Ulwar sabre and Tonk jezail
 Mewar headstall and Marwar mail
 That clinked in the palace yard

 In the Golden room on the palace roof
 All night he fought for air
 And there was sobbing behind the screen
 Rustle and whisper of women unseen
 And the hungry eyes of the Boondi Queen
 On the death she might not share

 He passed at dawnthe deathfire leaped
 From ridge to riverhead
 From the Malwa plains to the Abu scars
 And wail upon wail went up to the stars
 Behind the grim zenanabars
 When they knew that the King was dead

 The dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth
 And robe him for the pyre
 The Boondi Queen beneath us cried
 See now that we die as our mothers died
 In the bridalbed by our masters side
 Out womento the fire

 We drove the great gates home apace
 White hands were on the sill
 But ere the rush of the unseen feet
 Had reached the turn to the open street
 The bars shot down the guarddrum beat
 We held the dovecot still

 A face looked down in the gathering day
 And laughing spoke from the wall
 Ohe they mourn here let me by
 Azizun the Lucknow nautchgirl I
 When the house is rotten the rats must fly
 And I seek another thrall

 For I ruled the King as neer did Queen
 Tonight the Queens rule me
 Guard them safely but let me go
 Or ever they pay the debt they owe
 In scourge and torture She leaped below
 And the grim guard watched her flee

 They knew that the King had spent his soul
 On a Northbred dancinggirl
 That he prayed to a flatnosed Lucknow god
 And kissed the ground where her feet had trod
 And doomed to death at her drunken nod
 And swore by her lightest curl

 We bore the King to his fathers place
 Where the tombs of the Sunborn stand
 Where the gray apes swing and the peacocks preen
 On fretted pillar and jewelled screen
 And the wild boar couch in the house of the Queen
 On the drift of the desert sand

 The herald read his titles forth
 We set the logs aglow
 Friend of the English free from fear
 Baron of Luni to Jeysulmeer
 Lord of the Desert of Bikaneer
 King of the Junglego

 All night the red flame stabbed the sky
 With wavering windtossed spears
 And out of a shattered temple crept
 A woman who veiled her head and wept
 And called on the Kingbut the great King slept
 And turned not for her tears

 Small thought had he to mark the strife
 Cold fear with hot desire
 When thrice she leaped from the leaping flame
 And thrice she beat her breast for shame
 And thrice like a wounded dove she came
 And moaned about the fire

 One watched a bowshot from the blaze
 The silent streets between
 Who had stood by the King in sport and fray
 To blade in ambush or boar at bay
 And he was a baron old and gray
 And kin to the Boondi Queen

 He said O shameless put aside
 The veil upon thy brow
 Who held the King and all his land
 To the wanton will of a harlots hand
 Will the white ash rise from the blistered brand
 Stoop down and call him now

 Then she By the faith of my tarnished soul
 All things I did not well
 I had hoped to clear ere the fire died
 And lay me down by my masters side
 To rule in Heaven his only bride
 While the others howl in Hell

 But I have felt the fires breath
 And hard it is to die
 Yet if I may pray a Rajpoot lord
 To sully the steel of a Thakurs sword
 With baseborn blood of a trade abhorred
 And the Thakur answered Ay

 He drew and struck the straight blade drank
 The life beneath the breast

 I had looked for the Queen to face the flame
 But the harlot dies for the Rajpoot dame
 Sister of mine pass free from shame
 Pass with thy King to rest

 The black log crashed above the white
 The little flames and lean
 Red as slaughter and blue as steel
 That whistled and fluttered from head to heel
 Leaped up anew for they found their meal
 On the heart ofthe Boondi Queen




THE BALLAD OF THE KINGS MERCY

 Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief
 of him is the story told
 His mercy fills the Khyber hills
 his grace is manifold
 He has taken toll of the North and the South
 his glory reacheth far
 And they tell the tale of his charity
 from Balkh to Kandahar




Before the old Peshawur Gate where Kurd and Kaffir meet
 The Governor of Kabul dealt the Justice of the Street
 And that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife
 Tho he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life




There was a hound of Hindustan had struck a Euzufzai
 Wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die

 It chanced the King went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife
 The Kaffir grovelled underhoof and clamoured for his life




Then said the King Have hope O friend Yea Death disgraced is hard
 Much honour shall be thine and called the Captain of the Guard
 Yar Khan a bastard of the Blood so citybabble saith
 And he was honoured of the Kingthe which is salt to Death
 And he was son of Daoud Shah the Reiver of the Plains
 And blood of old Durani Lords ran fire in his veins
 And twas to tame an Afghan pride nor Hell nor Heaven could bind
 The King would make him butcher to a yelping cur of Hind




Strike said the King Kings blood art thouhis death shall be his
 pride
 Then louder that the crowd might catch Fear nothis arms are tied
 Yar Khan drew clear the Khyber knife and struck and sheathed again
 O man thy will is done quoth he a King this dog hath slain

 Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief
 to the North and the South is sold
 The North and the South shall open their mouth
 to a Ghilzai flag unrolled
 When the big guns speak to the Khyber peak
 and his dogHeratis fly
 Ye have heard the songHow long How long
 Wolves of the Abazai

 That night before the watch was set when all the streets were clear
 The Governor of Kabul spoke My King hast thou no fear
 Thou knowestthou hast heardhis speech died at his masters face

 And grimly said the Afghan King I rule the Afghan race
 My path is minesee thou to thinetonight upon thy bed
 Think who there be in Kabul now that clamour for thy head

 That night when all the gates were shut to City and to throne
 Within a little gardenhouse the King lay down alone

 Before the sinking of the moon which is the Night of Night
 Yar Khan came softly to the King to make his honour white
 The children of the town had mocked beneath his horses hoofs
 The harlots of the town had hailed him butcher from their roofs

 But as he groped against the wall two hands upon him fell
 The King behind his shoulder spake Dead man thou dost not well
 Tis ill to jest with Kings by day and seek a boon by night
 And that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write

 But three days hence if God be good and if thy strength remain
 Thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain
 For I am merciful to all and most of all to thee

 My butcher of the shambles restno knife hast thou for me

 Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief
 holds hard by the South and the North
 But the Ghilzai knows ere the melting snows
 when the swollen banks break forth
 When the redcoats crawl to the sungar wall
 and his Usbeg lances fail
 Ye have heard the songHow long How long
 Wolves of the Zuka Kheyl

 They stoned him in the rubbishfield when dawn was in the sky
 According to the written word See that he do not die

 They stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain
 And those the labouring limbs displaced they tumbled back again




One watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered
 thing
 And him the King with laughter called the Herald of the King




It was upon the second night the night of Ramazan
 The watcher leaning earthward heard the message of Yar Khan

 From shattered breast through shrivelled lips broke forth the rattling breath
 Creature of God deliver me from agony of Death

 They sought the King among his girls and risked their lives thereby
 Protector of the Pitiful give orders that he die

 Bid him endure until the day a lagging answer came
 The night is short and he can pray and learn to bless my name

 Before the dawn three times he spoke and on the day once more
 Creature of God deliver me and bless the King therefor

 They shot him at the morning prayer to ease him of his pain
 And when he heard the matchlocks clink he blessed the King again

 Which thing the singers made a song for all the world to sing
 So that the Outer Seas may know the mercy of the King

 Abdhur Rahman the Durani Chief
 of him is the story told
 He has opened his mouth to the North and the South
 they have stuffed his mouth with gold

 Ye know the truth of his tender ruth
 and sweet his favours are
 Ye have heard the songHow long How long
 from Balkh to Kandahar




THE BALLAD OF THE KINGS JEST

 When springtime flushes the desert grass
 Our kafilas wind through the Khyber Pass

 Lean are the camels but fat the frails
 Light are the purses but heavy the bales
 As the snowbound trade of the North comes down
 To the marketsquare of Peshawur town

 In a turquoise twilight crisp and chill
 A kafila camped at the foot of the hill

 Then blue smokehaze of the cooking rose
 And tentpeg answered to hammernose
 And the picketed ponies shag and wild
 Strained at their ropes as the feed was piled
 And the bubbling camels beside the load
 Sprawled for a furlong adown the road
 And the Persian pussycats brought for sale
 Spat at the dogs from the camelbale
 And the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food
 And the campfires twinkled by Fort Jumrood
 And there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk
 A savour of camels and carpets and musk
 A murmur of voices a reek of smoke
 To tell us the trade of the Khyber woke

 The lid of the fleshpot chattered high
 The knives were whetted andthen came I
 To Mahbub Ali the muleteer
 Patching his bridles and counting his gear
 Crammed with the gossip of half a year

 But Mahbub Ali the kindly said
 Better is speech when the belly is fed
 So we plunged the hand to the midwrist deep
 In a cinnamon stew of the fattailed sheep
 And he who never hath tasted the food
 By Allah he knoweth not bad from good

 We cleansed our beards of the muttongrease
 We lay on the mats and were filled with peace
 And the talk slid north and the talk slid south
 With the sliding puffs from the hookahmouth

 Four things greater than all things are
 Women and Horses and Power and War

 We spake of them all but the last the most
 For I sought a word of a Russian post
 Of a shifty promise an unsheathed sword
 And a graycoat guard on the Helmund ford

 Then Mahbub Ali lowered his eyes
 In the fashion of one who is weaving lies

 Quoth he Of the Russians who can say
 When the night is gathering all is gray
 But we look that the gloom of the night shall die
 In the morning flush of a bloodred sky

 Friend of my heart is it meet or wise
 To warn a King of his enemies
 We know what Heaven or Hell may bring
 But no man knoweth the mind of the King

 That unsought counsel is cursed of God
 Attesteth the story of Wali Dad

 His sire was leaky of tongue and pen
 His dam was a clucking Khuttuck hen
 And the colt bred close to the vice of each
 For he carried the curse of an unstanched speech

 Therewith madnessso that he sought
 The favour of kings at the Kabul court
 And travelled in hope of honour far
 To the line where the graycoat squadrons are

 There have I journeyed toobut I
 Saw naught said naught anddid not die
 He harked to rumour and snatched at a breath
 Of this one knoweth and that one saith
 Legends that ran from mouth to mouth
 Of a graycoat coming and sack of the South

 These have I also heardthey pass
 With each new spring and the winter grass

 Hotfoot southward forgotten of God
 Back to the city ran Wali Dad
 Even to Kabulin full durbar
 The King held talk with his Chief in War

 Into the press of the crowd he broke
 And what he had heard of the coming spoke




Then Gholam Hyder the Red Chief smiled
 As a mother might on a babbling child
 But those who would laugh restrained their breath
 When the face of the King showed dark as death

 Evil it is in full durbar
 To cry to a ruler of gathering war
 Slowly he led to a peachtree small
 That grew by a cleft of the city wall

 And he said to the boy They shall praise thy zeal
 So long as the red spurt follows the steel

 And the Russ is upon us even now
 Great is thy prudenceawait them thou
 Watch from the tree Thou art young and strong
 Surely thy vigil is not for long

 The Russ is upon us thy clamour ran
 Surely an hour shall bring their van
 Wait and watch When the host is near
 Shout aloud that my men may hear

 Friend of my heart is it meet or wise
 To warn a King of his enemies
 A guard was set that he might not flee
 A score of bayonets ringed the tree

 The peachbloom fell in showers of snow
 When he shook at his death as he looked below
 By the power of God who alone is great
 Till the seventh day he fought with his fate

 Then madness took him and men declare
 He mowed in the branches as ape and bear
 And last as a sloth ere his body failed
 And he hung as a bat in the forks and wailed
 And sleep the cord of his hands untied
 And he fell and was caught on the points and died

 Heart of my heart is it meet or wise
 To warn a King of his enemies
 We know what Heaven or Hell may bring
 But no man knoweth the mind of the King

 Of the graycoat coming who can say
 When the night is gathering all is gray

 To things greater than all things are
 The first is Love and the second War

 And since we know not how War may prove
 Heart of my heart let us talk of Love




THE BALLAD OF BOH DA THONE

 This is the ballad of Boh Da Thone
 Erst a Pretender to Theebaws throne
 Who harried the district of Alalone
 How he met with his fate and the VPP

 At the hand of Harendra Mukerji
 Senior Gomashta GBT

 Boh Da Thone was a warrior bold
 His sword and his Snider were bossed with gold

 And the Peacock Banner his henchmen bore
 Was stiff with bullion but stiffer with gore

 He shot at the strong and he slashed at the weak
 From the Salween scrub to the Chindwin teak

 He crucified noble he sacrificed mean
 He filled old ladies with kerosene

 While over the water the papers cried
 The patriot fights for his countryside

 But little they cared for the Native Press
 The worn white soldiers in Khaki dress

 Who tramped through the jungle and camped in the byre
 Who died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire

 Who gave up their lives at the Queens Command
 For the Pride of their Race and the Peace of the Land

 Now first of the foemen of Boh Da Thone
 Was Captain ONeil of the Black Tyrone
 And his was a Company seventy strong
 Who hustled that dissolute Chief along

 There were lads from Galway and Louth and Meath
 Who went to their death with a joke in their teeth
 And worshipped with fluency fervour and zeal
 The mud on the bootheels of Crook ONeil

 But ever a blight on their labours lay
 And ever their quarry would vanish away
 Till the sundried boys of the Black Tyrone
 Took a brotherly interest in Boh Da Thone
 And sooth if pursuit in possession ends
 The Boh and his trackers were best of friends

 The word of a scouta march by night
 A rush through the mista scattering fight
 A volley from covera corpse in the clearing
 The glimpse of a loincloth and heavy jade earring
 The flare of a villagethe tally of slain
 Andthe Boh was abroad on the raid again

 They cursed their luck as the Irish will
 They gave him credit for cunning and skill
 They buried their dead they bolted their beef
 And started anew on the track of the thief
 Till in place of the Kalends of Greece men said
 When Crook and his darlings come back with the head

 They had hunted the Boh from the hills to the plain
 He doubled and broke for the hills again
 They had crippled his power for rapine and raid
 They had routed him out of his pet stockade
 And at last they came when the Day Star tired
 To a camp deserteda village fired

 A black cross blistered the Morninggold
 And the body upon it was stark and cold
 The wind of the dawn went merrily past
 The high grass bowed her plumes to the blast

 And out of the grass on a sudden broke
 A spirtle of fire a whorl of smoke

 And Captain ONeil of the Black Tyrone
 Was blessed with a slug in the ulnarbone
 The gift of his enemy Boh Da Thone

 Now a slug that is hammered from telegraphwire
 Is a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire
     

 The shotwound festeredas shotwounds may
 In a steaming barrack at Mandalay

 The left arm throbbed and the Captain swore
 Id like to be after the Boh once more
 The fever held himthe Captain said
 Id give a hundred to look at his head

 The Hospital punkahs creaked and whirred
 But Babu Harendra Gomashta heard

 He thought of the canebrake green and dank
 That girdled his home by the Dacca tank
 He thought of his wife and his High School son
 He thoughtbut abandoned the thoughtof a gun
 His sleep was broken by visions dread
 Of a shining Boh with a silver head

 He kept his counsel and went his way
 And swindled the cartmen of half their pay
     

 And the months went on as the worst must do
 And the Boh returned to the raid anew

 But the Captain had quitted the longdrawn strife
 And in far Simoorie had taken a wife
 And she was a damsel of delicate mould
 With hair like the sunshine and heart of gold

 And little she knew the arms that embraced
 Had cloven a man from the brow to the waist
 And little she knew that the loving lips
 Had ordered a quivering lifes eclipse

 And the eye that lit at her lightest breath
 Had glared unawed in the Gates of Death

 For these be matters a man would hide
 As a general rule from an innocent Bride

 And little the Captain thought of the past
 And of all men Babu Harendra last
     

 But slow in the sludge of the Kathun road
 The Government Bullock Train toted its load
 Speckless and spotless and shining with ghee
 In the rearmost cart sat the Babujee

 And ever a phantom before him fled
 Of a scowling Boh with a silver head

 Then the leadcart stuck though the coolies slaved
 And the cartmen flogged and the escort raved
 And out of the jungle with yells and squeals
 Pranced Boh Da Thone and his gang at his heels

 Then belching blunderbuss answered back
 The Sniders snarl and the carbines crack
 And the blithe revolver began to sing
 To the blade that twanged on the lockingring
 And the brown flesh blued where the baynet kissed
 As the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist
 And the great white bullocks with onyx eyes
 Watched the souls of the dead arise
 And over the smoke of the fusillade
 The Peacock Banner staggered and swayed

 Oh gayest of scrimmages man may see
 Is a wellworked rush on the GBT

 The Babu shook at the horrible sight
 And girded his ponderous loins for flight
 But Fate had ordained that the Boh should start
 On a lonehand raid of the rearmost cart
 And out of that cart with a bellow of woe
 The Babu fellflat on the top of the Boh

 For years had Harendra served the State
 To the growth of his purse and the girth of his _pet_

 There were twenty stone as the tallyman knows
 On the broad of the chest of this best of Bohs
 And twenty stone from a height discharged
 Are bad for a Boh with a spleen enlarged

 Oh short was the strugglesevere was the shock
 He dropped like a bullockhe lay like a block
 And the Babu above him convulsed with fear
 Heard the labouring lifebreath hissed out in his ear

 And thus in a fashion undignified
 The princely pest of the Chindwin died
     

 Turn now to Simoorie where lapped in his ease
 The Captain is petting the Bride on his knees
 Where the whit of the bullet the wounded mans scream
 Are mixed as the mist of some devilish dream
 Forgotten forgotten the sweat of the shambles
 Where the hilldaisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols
 From the swordbelt set free and released from the steel
 The Peace of the Lord is with Captain ONeil
     

 Up the hill to Simooriemost patient of drudges
 The bags on his shoulder the mailrunner trudges

 For Captain ONeil Sahib One hundred and ten
 Rupees to collect on delivery
 Then

 Their breakfast was stopped while the screwjack and hammer
 Tore waxcloth split teakwood and chipped out the dammer

 Openeyed openmouthed on the naperys snow
 With a crash and a thud rolledthe Head of the Boh

 And gummed to the scalp was a letter which ran
 IN FIELDING FORCE SERVICE

 Encampment
 th Jan

 Dear SirI have honour to send as you said
 For final approval see under Bohs Head

 Was took by myself in most bloody affair

 By High Education brought pressure to bear

 Now violate Liberty time being bad
 To mail VPP rupees hundred Please add

 Whatever Your Honour can pass Price of Blood
 Much cheap at one hundred and children want food

 So trusting Your Honour will somewhat retain
 True love and affection for Govt Bullock Train

 And show awful kindness to satisfy me
 I am
 Graceful Master
 Your
 H MUKERJI
     

 As the rabbit is drawn to the rattlesnakes power
 As the smokers eye fills at the opium hour
 As a horse reaches up to the manger above
 As the waiting ear yearns for the whisper of love
 From the arms of the Bride ironvisaged and slow
 The Captain bent down to the Head of the Boh

 And een as he looked on the Thing where It lay
 Twixt the winking new spoons and the napkins array
 The freed mind fled back to the longago days
 The handtohand scufflethe smoke and the blaze
 The forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn
 The banjo at twilight the burial ere morn
 The stench of the marshesthe raw piercing smell
 When the overhand stabbingcut silenced the yell
 The oaths of his Irish that surged when they stood
 Where the black crosses hung oer the Kuttamow flood

 As a derelict ship drifts away with the tide
 The Captain went out on the Past from his Bride

 Back back through the springs to the chill of the year
 When he hunted the Boh from Maloon to Tsaleer

 As the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep water
 In his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter
 And men who had fought with ONeil for the life
 Had gazed on his face with less dread than his wife

 For she who had held him so long could not hold him
 Though a fourmonth Eternity should have controlled him
 But watched the twin Terrorthe head turned to head
 The scowling scarred Black and the flushed savage Red
 The spirit that changed from her knowing and flew to
 Some grim hidden Past she had never a clue to

 But It knew as It grinned for he touched it unfearing
 And muttered aloud So you kept that jade earring

 Then nodded and kindly as friend nods to friend
 Old man you fought well but you lost in the end
     

 The visions departed and Shame followed Passion
 He took what I said in this horrible fashion

 Ill write to Harendra With language unsainted
 The Captain came back to the Bride who had fainted
     

 And this is a fiction No Go to Simoorie
 And look at their baby a twelvemonth old Houri
 A pert little Irisheyed Kathleen Mavournin
 Shes always about on the Mall of a mornin

 And youll see if her right shoulderstrap is displaced
 This Gules upon argent a Bohs Head erased




THE LAMENT OF THE BORDER CATTLE THIEF

 O woe is me for the merry life
 I led beyond the Bar
 And a treble woe for my winsome wife
 That weeps at Shalimar

 They have taken away my long jezail
 My shield and sabre fine
 And heaved me into the Central jail
 For lifting of the kine

 The steer may low within the byre
 The Jat may tend his grain
 But therell be neither loot nor fire
 Till I come back again

 And God have mercy on the Jat
 When once my fetters fall
 And Heaven defend the farmers hut
 When I am loosed from thrall

 Its woe to bend the stubborn back
 Above the grinching quern
 Its woe to hear the legbar clack
 And jingle when I turn

 But for the sorrow and the shame
 The brand on me and mine
 Ill pay you back in leaping flame
 And loss of the butchered kine

 For every cow I spared before
 In charity set free
 If I may reach my hold once more
 Ill reive an honest three

 For every time I raised the low
 That scared the dusty plain
 By sword and cord by torch and tow
 Ill light the land with twain

 Ride hard ride hard to Abazai
 Young Sahib with the yellow hair
 Lie close lie close as khuttucks lie
 Fat herds below Bonair

 The one Ill shoot at twilighttide
 At dawn Ill drive the other
 The black shall mourn for hoof and hide
 The white man for his brother

 Tis war red war Ill give you then
 War till my sinews fail
 For the wrong you have done to a chief of men
 And a thief of the Zukka Kheyl

 And if I fall to your hand afresh
 I give you leave for the sin
 That you cram my throat with the foul pigs flesh
 And swing me in the skin




THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS

 This ballad appears to refer to one of the exploits of the notorious Paul
 Jones the American pirate It is founded on fact




 At the close of a winter day
 Their anchors down by London town the Three Great Captains lay
 And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye
 And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby
 And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall
 And he was Captain of the Fleetthe bravest of them all

 Their good guns guarded their great gray sides that were thirty foot in the
 sheer
 When there came a certain tradingbrig with news of a privateer

 Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze
 Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas

 Light she rode in the rude tiderip to left and right she rolled
 And the skipper sat on the scuttlebutt and stared at an empty hold

 I ha paid Port dues for your Law quoth he and where is the Law ye boast
 If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast
 Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk
 We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a plunging Peiho junk
 I had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare
 Till I met with a limewashed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre

 There were canvas blinds to his bowgun ports to screen the weight he bore
 And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore

 He would not fly the Rovers flagthe bloody or the black
 But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack
 He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crewhe swore it was only a loan
 But when I would ask for my own again he swore it was none of my own

 He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line
 He has stripped my rails of the shaddockfrails and the green unripened pine
 He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas
 He has taken my grinning heathen godsand what should he want o these
 My foremast would not mend his boom my deckhouse patch his boats
 He has whittled the two this Yank Yahoo to peddle for shoepeg oats

 I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beamsea beside
 But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied

 Had I had guns as I had goods to work my Christian harm
 I had run him up from his quarterdeck to trade with his own yardarm
 I had nailed his ears to my capstanhead and ripped them off with a saw
 And soused them in the bilgewater and served them to him raw
 I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark
 I had towed him aft of his own craft a bait for his brother shark
 I had lapped him round with cocoa husk and drenched him with the oil
 And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil
 I had stripped his hide for my hammockside and tasselled his beard i the
 mesh
 And spitted his crew on the live bamboo that grows through the gangrened
 flesh
 I had hove him down by the mangroves brown where the mudreef sucks and
 draws
 Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the landcrabs claws
 He is lazar within and lime without ye can nose him far enow
 For he carries the taint of a musky shipthe reek of the slavers dhow
 The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold
 And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold
 And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttlebutt
 Good Sir we ha dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut

 Your words be words of a lawless race and the Law it standeth thus
 He comes of a race that have never a Law and he never has boarded us

 We ha sold him canvas and rope and sparwe know that his price is fair
 And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre

 And since he is damned for a gallowsthief by you and better than you
 We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true
 The skipper called to the tall taffrailAnd what is that to me
 Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventythree
 Do I loom so large from your quarterdeck that I lift like a ship o the Line
 He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine

 There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in
 But we do not steal the niggers meal for that is a niggers sin

 Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw or laid in brass on his wheel
 Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers Fore Gad then why does he
 steal
 The skipper bit on a deepsea word and the word it was not sweet
 For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet

 But three and two in white and blue the whimpering flags began
 We have heard a tale of aforeign sail but he is a merchantman
 The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon
 Fore Gad the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon
 By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air
 We have sold our spars to the merchantmanwe know that his price is fair
 The skipper winked his Western eye and swore by a China storm
 They ha rigged him a Josephs jurycoat to keep his honour warm
 The halliards twanged against the tops the bunting bellied broad
 The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord

 Mastheadmasthead the signal sped by the line o the British craft
 The skipper called to his Lascar crew and put her about and laughed
 Its mainsail haul my bully boys allwell out to the seas again
 Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint or scrub at his grapnelchain

 Its foresheet free with her head to the sea and the swing of the unbought
 brine
 Well make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o the Line
 Till we come as a ship o the Line my lads of thirty foot in the sheer
 Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer
 Flying his pluck at our mizzentruck for weft of Admiralty
 Heaving his head for our dipseylead in sign that we keep the sea

 Then foresheet home as she lifts to the foamwe stand on the outward tack
 We are paid in the coin of the white mans tradethe bezant is hard ay and
 black

 The frigatebird shall carry my word to the Kling and the OrangLaut
 How a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a Christian port
 How a man may be robbed in Christian port while Three Great Captains there
 Shall dip their flag to a slavers ragto show that his trade is fair




THE BALLAD OF THE CLAMPHERDOWN

 It was our warship Clampherdown
 Would sweep the Channel clean
 Wherefore she kept her hatches close
 When the merry Channel chops arose
 To save the bleached marine

 She had one bowgun of a hundred ton
 And a great sterngun beside
 They dipped their noses deep in the sea
 They racked their stays and stanchions free
 In the wash of the windwhipped tide

 It was our warship Clampherdown
 Fell in with a cruiser light
 That carried the dainty Hotchkiss gun
 And a pair o heels wherewith to run
 From the grip of a closefought fight

 She opened fire at seven miles
 As ye shoot at a bobbing cork
 And once she fired and twice she fired
 Till the bowgun drooped like a lily tired
 That lolls upon the stalk

 Captain the bowgun melts apace
 The deckbeams break below
 Twere well to rest for an hour or twain
 And patch the shattered plates again
 And he answered Make it so

 She opened fire within the mile
 As ye shoot at the flying duck
 And the great sterngun shot fair and true
 With the heave of the ship to the stainless blue
 And the great sternturret stuck

 Captain the turret fills with steam
 The feedpipes burst below
 You can hear the hiss of the helpless ram
 You can hear the twisted runners jam
 And he answered Turn and go

 It was our warship Clampherdown
 And grimly did she roll
 Swung round to take the cruisers fire
 As the White Whale faces the Threshers ire
 When they war by the frozen Pole

 Captain the shells are falling fast
 And faster still fall we
 And it is not meet for English stock
 To bide in the heart of an eightday clock
 The death they cannot see

 Lie down lie down my bold AB
 We drift upon her beam
 We dare not ram for she can run
 And dare ye fire another gun
 And die in the peeling steam

 It was our warship Clampherdown
 That carried an armourbelt
 But fifty feet at stern and bow
 Lay bare as the paunch of the pursers sow
 To the hail of the Nordenfeldt

 Captain they hack us through and through
 The chilled steel bolts are swift
 We have emptied the bunkers in open sea
 Their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be
 And he answered Let her drift

 It was our warship Clampherdown
 Swung round upon the tide
 Her two dumb guns glared south and north
 And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth
 And she ground the cruisers side

 Captain they cry the fight is done
 They bid you send your sword
 And he answered Grapple her stern and bow
 They have asked for the steel They shall have it now
 Out cutlasses and board

 It was our warship Clampherdown
 Spewed up four hundred men
 And the scalded stokers yelped delight
 As they rolled in the waist and heard the fight
 Stamp oer their steelwalled pen

 They cleared the cruiser end to end
 From conningtower to hold
 They fought as they fought in Nelsons fleet
 They were stripped to the waist they were bare to the feet
 As it was in the days of old

 It was the sinking Clampherdown
 Heaved up her battered side
 And carried a million pounds in steel
 To the cod and the corpsefed congereel
 And the scour of the Channel tide

 It was the crew of the Clampherdown
 Stood out to sweep the sea
 On a cruiser won from an ancient foe
 As it was in the days of long ago
 And as it still shall be




THE BALLAD OF THE BOLIVAR

 Seven men from all the world back to Docks again
 Rolling down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain
 Give the girls another drink fore we sign away
 We that took the Bolivar out across the Bay

 We put out from Sunderland loaded down with rails
 We put back to Sunderland cause our cargo shifted
 We put out from Sunderlandmet the winter gales
 Seven days and seven nights to the Start we drifted

 Racketing her rivets loose smokestack white as snow
 All the coals adrift adeck half the rails below
 Leaking like a lobsterpot steering like a dray
 Out we took the Bolivar out across the Bay

 One by one the Lights came up winked and let us by
 Mile by mile we waddled on coal and focsle short
 Met a blow that laid us down heard a bulkhead fly
 Left the Wolf behind us with a twofoot list to port

 Trailing like a wounded duck working out her soul
 Clanging like a smithyshop after every roll
 Just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray
 So we threshed the Bolivar out across the Bay

 Felt her hog and felt her sag betted when shed break
 Wondered every time she raced if shed stand the shock
 Heard the seas like drunken men pounding at her strake
 Hoped the Lord ud keep his thumb on the plummerblock

 Banged against the iron decks bilges choked with coal
 Flayed and frozen foot and hand sick of heart and soul
 Last we prayed shed buck herself into judgment Day
 Hi we cursed the Bolivarknocking round the Bay

 O her nose flung up to sky groaning to be still
 Up and down and back we went never time for breath
 Then the money paid at Lloyds caught her by the heel
 And the stars ran round and round dancin at our death

 Aching for an hours sleep dozing off between
 Heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green
 Watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play
 That was on the Bolivar south across the Bay




Once we saw between the squalls lyin head to swell
 Mad with work and weariness wishin they was we
 Some damned Liners lights go by like a long hotel
 Cheered her from the Bolivarswampin in the sea

 Then a grayback cleared us out then the skipper laughed
 Boys the wheel has gone to Hellrig the winches aft
 Yoke the kicking rudderheadget her under way
 So we steered her pulleyhaul out across the Bay

 Just a pack o rotten plates puttied up with tar
 In we came an time enough cross Bilbao Bar

 Overloaded undermanned meant to founder we
 Euchred God Almightys storm bluffed the Eternal Sea

 Seven men from all the world back to town again
 Rollin down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain
 Seven men from out of Hell Aint the owners gay
 Cause we took the Bolivar safe across the Bay




THE ENGLISH FLAG

 Above the portico a flagstaff bearing the Union Jack
 remained fluttering in the flames for some time but ultimately
 when it fell the crowds rent the air with shouts
 and seemed to see significance in the incidentDAILY PAPERS




Winds of the World give answer They are whimpering to and fro
 And what should they know of England who only England know
 The poor little streetbred people that vapour and fume and brag
 They are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English Flag

 Must we borrow a clout from the Boerto plaster anew with dirt
 An Irish liars bandage or an English cowards shirt

 We may not speak of England her Flags to sell or share
 What is the Flag of England Winds of the World declare

 The North Wind blewFrom Bergen my steelshod vanguards go
 I chase your lazy whalers home from the Disko floe
 By the great North Lights above me I work the will of God
 And the liner splits on the icefield or the Dogger fills with cod

 I barred my gates with iron I shuttered my doors with flame
 Because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came
 I took the sun from their presence I cut them down with my blast
 And they died but the Flag of England blew free ere the spirit passed

 The lean white bear hath seen it in the long long Arctic night
 The muskox knows the standard that flouts the Northern Light
 What is the Flag of England Ye have but my bergs to dare
 Ye have but my drifts to conquer Go forth for it is there

 The South Wind sighedFrom the Virgins my midsea course was taen
 Over a thousand islands lost in an idle main
 Where the seaegg flames on the coral and the longbacked breakers croon
 Their endless ocean legends to the lazy locked lagoon

 Strayed amid lonely islets mazed amid outer keys
 I waked the palms to laughterI tossed the scud in the breeze
 Never was isle so little never was sea so lone
 But over the scud and the palmtrees an English flag was flown

 I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the Horn
 I have chased it north to the Lizardribboned and rolled and torn
 I have spread its fold oer the dying adrift in a hopeless sea
 I have hurled it swift on the slaver and seen the slave set free

 My basking sunfish know it and wheeling albatross
 Where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the Southern Cross
 What is the Flag of England Ye have but my reefs to dare
 Ye have but my seas to furrow Go forth for it is there

 The East Wind roaredFrom the Kuriles the Bitter Seas I come
 And me men call the HomeWind for I bring the English home
 Looklook well to your shipping By the breath of my mad typhoon
 I swept your closepacked Praya and beached your best at Kowloon

 The reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before
 I raped your richest roadsteadI plundered Singapore
 I set my hand on the Hoogli as a hooded snake she rose
 And I flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows

 Never the lotus closes never the wildfowl wake
 But a soul goes out on the East Wind that died for Englands sake
 Man or woman or suckling mother or bride or maid
 Because on the bones of the English the English Flag is stayed

 The desertdust hath dimmed it the flying wildass knows
 The scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows
 What is the Flag of England Ye have but my sun to dare
 Ye have but my sands to travel Go forth for it is there

 The West Wind calledIn squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly
 That bear the wheat and cattle lest streetbred people die
 They make my might their porter they make my house their path
 Till I loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath

 I draw the gliding fogbank as a snake is drawn from the hole
 They bellow one to the other the frighted shipbells toll
 For day is a drifting terror till I raise the shroud with my breath
 And they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death

 But whether in calm or wrackwreath whether by dark or day
 I heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away
 First of the scattered legions under a shrieking sky
 Dipping between the rollers the English Flag goes by

 The dead dumb fog hath wrapped itthe frozen dews have kissed
 The naked stars have seen it a fellowstar in the mist
 What is the Flag of England Ye have but my breath to dare
 Ye have but my waves to conquer Go forth for it is there




CLEARED
 In Memory of a Commission

 Help for a patriot distressed a spotless spirit hurt
 Help for an honorable clan sore trampled in the dirt
 From Queenstown Bay to Donegal O listen to my song
 The honorable gentlemen have suffered grievous wrong

 Their noble names were mentionedO the burning black disgrace
 By a brutal Saxon paper in an Irish shootingcase
 They sat upon it for a year then steeled their heart to brave it
 And coruscating innocence the learned Judges gave it

 Bear witness Heaven of that grim crime beneath the surgeons knife
 The honorable gentlemen deplored the loss of life
 Bear witness of those chanting choirs that burk and shirk and snigger
 No man laid hand upon the knife or finger to the trigger

 Cleared in the face of all mankind beneath the winking skies
 Like phoenixes from Phoenix Park and what lay there they rise
 Go shout it to the emerald seasgive word to Erin now
 Her honorable gentlemen are clearedand this is how

 They only paid the Moonlighter his cattlehocking price
 They only helped the murderer with councils best advice
 Butsure it keeps their honor whitethe learned Court believes
 They never gave a piece of plate to murderers and thieves

 They ever told the ramping crowd to card a womans hide
 They never marked a man for deathwhat fault of theirs he died
 They only said intimidate and talked and went away
 By God the boys that did the work were braver men than they

 Their sin it was that fed the firesmall blame to them that heard
 The bhoys get drunk on rhetoric and madden at the word
 They knew whom they were talking at if they were Irish too
 The gentlemen that lied in Court they knew and well they knew

 They only took the Judasgold from Fenians out of jail
 They only fawned for dollars on the blooddyed ClannaGael
 If black is black or white is white ill black and white its down
 Theyre only traitors to the Queen and rebels to the Crown

 Cleared honorable gentlemen Be thankful its no more
 The widows curse is on your house the dead are at your door
 On you the shame of open shame on you from North to South
 The band of every honest man flatheeled across your mouth

 Less black than we were paintedFaith no word of black was said
 The lightest touch was human blood and that ye know runs red
 Its sticking to your fist today for all your sneer and scoff
 And by the Judges wellweighed word you cannot wipe it off

 Hold up those hands of innocencego scare your sheep together
 The blundering tripping tups that bleat behind the old bellwether
 And if they snuff the taint and break to find another pen
 Tell them its tar that glistens so and daub them yours again

 The charge is oldAs old as Cainas fresh as yesterday
 Old as the Ten Commandments have ye talked those laws away
 If words are words or death is death or powder sends the ball
 You spoke the words that sped the shotthe curse be on you all

 Our friends believe Of course they doas sheltered women may
 But have they seen the shrieking soul ripped from the quivering clay
 TheyIf their own front door is shut theyll swear the whole worlds warm
 What do they know of dread of death or hanging fear of harm

 The secret half a country keeps the whisper in the lane
 The shriek that tells the shot went home behind the broken pane
 The dry blood crisping in the sun that scares the honest bees
 And shows the bhoys have heard your talkwhat do they know of these

 But youyou knoway ten times more the secrets of the dead
 Black terror on the countryside by word and whisper bred
 The mangled stallions scream at night the tailcropped heifers low
 Who set the whisper going first You know and well you know

 My soul Id sooner lie in jail for murder plain and straight
 Pure crime Id done with my own hand for money lust or hate
 Than take a seat in Parliament by fellowfelons cheered
 While one of those not provens proved me cleared as you are cleared

 Clearedyou that lost the League accountsgo guard our honor still
 Go help to make our countrys laws that broke Gods laws at will
 One hand stuck out behind the back to signal strike again
 The other on your dressshirt front to show your heart is dane

 If black is black or white is white in black and white its down
 Youre only traitors to the Queen and but rebels to the Crown
 If print is print or words are words the learned Court perpends
 We are not ruled by murderers onlyby their friends




AN IMPERIAL RESCRIPT

 Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser decreed
 To ease the strong of their burden to help the weak in their need
 He sent a word to the peoples who struggle and pant and sweat
 That the straw might be counted fairly and the tally of bricks be set

 The Lords of Their Hands assembled from the East and the West they drew
 Baltimore Lille and Essen Brummagem Clyde and Crewe
 And some were black from the furnace and some were brown from the soil
 And some were blue from the dyevat but all were wearied of toil

 And the young King saidI have found it the road to the rest ye seek
 The strong shall wait for the weary the hale shall halt for the weak
 With the even tramp of an army where no man breaks from the line
 Ye shall march to peace and plenty in the bond of brotherhoodsign

 The paper lay on the table the strong heads bowed thereby
 And a wail went up from the peoplesAy signgive rest for we die
 A hand was stretched to the goosequill a fist was cramped to scrawl
 Whenthe laugh of a blueeyed maiden ran clear through the councilhall

 And each one heard Her laughing as each one saw Her plain
 Saidie Mimi or Olga Gretchen or Mary Jane
 And the Spirit of Man that is in Him to the light of the vision woke
 And the men drew back from the paper as a Yankee delegate spoke

 Theres a girl in Jersey City who works on the telephone
 Were going to hitch our horses and dig for a house of our own
 With gas and water connections and steamheat through to the top
 And W Hohenzollern I guess I shall work till I drop

 And an English delegate thunderedThe weak an the lame be blowed
 Ive a berth in the SouWest workshops a home in the Wandsworth Road
 And till the sociation has footed my buryin bill
 I work for the kids an the missus Pull up I be damned if I will

 And over the German benches the bearded whisper ran
 Lager der girls und der dollars dey makes or dey breaks a man
 If Schmitt haf collared der dollars he collars der girl deremit
 But if Schmitt bust in der pizness we collars der girl from Schmitt

 They passed one resolutionYour subcommittee believe
 You can lighten the curse of Adam when youve lightened the curse of Eve
 But till we are built like angels with hammer and chisel and pen
 We will work for ourself and a woman for ever and ever amen

 Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser held
 The day that they razored the Grindstone the day that the Cat was belled
 The day of the Figs from Thistles the day of the Twisted Sands
 The day that the laugh of a maiden made light of the Lords of Their Hands




TOMLINSON

 Now Tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in Berkeley Square
 And a Spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair
 A Spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away
 Till he heard as the roar of a rainfed ford the roar of the Milky Way
 Till he heard the roar of the Milky Way die down and drone and cease
 And they came to the Gate within the Wall where Peter holds the keys

 Stand up stand up now Tomlinson and answer loud and high
 The good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die
 The good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone
 And the naked soul of Tomlinson grew white as a rainwashed bone

 O I have a friend on earth he said that was my priest and guide
 And well would he answer all for me if he were by my side
 For that ye strove in neighbourlove it shall be written fair
 But now ye wait at Heavens Gate and not in Berkeley Square
 Though we called your friend from his bed this night he could not speak for
 you
 For the race is run by one and one and never by two and two
 Then Tomlinson looked up and down and little gain was there
 For the naked stars grinned overhead and he saw that his soul was bare
 The Wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife
 And Tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life

 This I have read in a book he said and that was told to me
 And this I have thought that another man thought of a Prince in Muscovy
 The good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path
 And Peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath

 Ye have read ye have heard ye have thought he said and the tale is yet
 to run
 By the worth of the body that once ye had give answerwhat haye done
 Then Tomlinson looked back and forth and little good it bore
 For the Darkness stayed at his shoulderblade and Heavens Gate before
 O this I have felt and this I have guessed and this I have heard men say
 And this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in Norroway
 Ye have read ye have felt ye have guessed good lack Ye have hampered
 Heavens Gate
 Theres little room between the stars in idleness to prate
 O none may reach by hired speech of neighbour priest and kin
 Through borrowed deed to Gods good meed that lies so fair within
 Get hence get hence to the Lord of Wrong for doom has yet to run
 And the faith that ye share with Berkeley Square uphold you Tomlinson
     

 The Spirit gripped him by the hair and sun by sun they fell
 Till they came to the belt of Naughty Stars that rim the mouth of Hell
 The first are red with pride and wrath the next are white with pain
 But the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again
 They may hold their path they may leave their path with never a soul to
 mark
 They may burn or freeze but they must not cease in the Scorn of the Outer
 Dark

 The Wind that blows between the worlds it nipped him to the bone
 And he yearned to the flare of HellGate there as the light of his own hearth
 stone

 The Devil he sat behind the bars where the desperate legions drew
 But he caught the hasting Tomlinson and would not let him through

 Wot ye the price of good pitcoal that I must pay said he
 That ye rank yoursel so fit for Hell and ask no leave of me
 I am all oersib to Adams breed that ye should give me scorn
 For I strove with God for your First Father the day that he was born

 Sit down sit down upon the slag and answer loud and high
 The harm that ye did to the Sons of Men or ever you came to die
 And Tomlinson looked up and up and saw against the night
 The belly of a tortured star bloodred in HellMouth light
 And Tomlinson looked down and down and saw beneath his feet
 The frontlet of a tortured star milkwhite in HellMouth heat

 O I had a love on earth said he that kissed me to my fall
 And if ye would call my love to me I know she would answer all
 All that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair
 But now ye wait at HellMouth Gate and not in Berkeley Square
 Though we whistled your love from her bed tonight I trow she would not run
 For the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one
 The Wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife
 And Tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life
 Once I ha laughed at the power of Love and twice at the grip of the Grave
 And thrice I ha patted my God on the head that men might call me brave
 The Devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool
 Do ye think I would waste my good pitcoal on the hide of a brainsick fool
 I see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did
 That I should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid
 Then Tomlinson looked back and forth and there was little grace
 For HellGate filled the houseless Soul with the Fear of Naked Space

 Nay this I ha heard quo Tomlinson and this was noised abroad
 And this I ha got from a Belgian book on the word of a dead French lord
 Ye ha heard ye ha read ye ha got good lack and the tale begins
 afresh
 Have ye sinned one sin for the pride o the eye or the sinful lust of the
 flesh
 Then Tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered Let me in
 For I mind that I borrowed my neighbours wife to sin the deadly sin
 The Devil he grinned behind the bars and banked the fires high
 Did ye read of that sin in a book said he and Tomlinson said Ay
 The Devil he blew upon his nails and the little devils ran
 And he said Go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man
 Winnow him out twixt star and star and sieve his proper worth
 Theres sore decline in Adams line if this be spawn of earth

 Empusas crew so nakednew they may not face the fire
 But weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire
 Over the coal they chased the Soul and racked it all abroad
 As children rifle a caddiscase or the ravens foolish hoard

 And back they came with the tattered Thing as children after play
 And they said The soul that he got from God he has bartered clean away

 We have threshed a stook of print and book and winnowed a chattering wind
 And many a soul wherefrom he stole but his we cannot find
 We have handled him we have dandled him we have seared him to the bone
 And sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own
 The Devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low
 Im all oersib to Adams breed that I should bid him go

 Yet close we lie and deep we lie and if I gave him place
 My gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face
 Theyd call my house a common stews and me a careless host
 AndI would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost
 The Devil he looked at the mangled Soul that prayed to feel the flame
 And he thought of Holy Charity but he thought of his own good name
 Now ye could haste my coal to waste and sit ye down to fry
 Did ye think of that theft for yourself said he and Tomlinson said Ay
 The Devil he blew an outward breath for his heart was free from care
 Ye have scarce the soul of a louse he said but the roots of sin are
 there
 And for that sin should ye come in were I the lord alone
 But sinful pride has rule insideand mightier than my own

 Honour and Wit foredamned they sit to each his priest and whore
 Nay scarce I dare myself go there and you theyd torture sore

 Ye are neither spirit nor spirk he said ye are neither book nor brute
 Go get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of Mans repute

 Im all oersib to Adams breed that I should mock your pain
 But look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again
 Get hence the hearse is at your doorthe grim black stallions wait
 They bear your clay to place today Speed lest ye come too late
 Go back to Earth with a lip unsealedgo back with an open eye
 And carry my word to the Sons of Men or ever ye come to die
 That the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one
 And the God that you took from a printed book be with you Tomlinson

 They sent me to the gallery or round the musicalls
 But when it comes to fightin Lord theyll shove me in the stalls
 For its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy wait outside
 But its Special train for Atkins when the troopers on the tide

FUZZYWUZZY
 Soudan Expeditionary Force

 Weve fought with many men acrost the seas
 An some of em was brave an some was not
 The Paythan an the Zulu an Burmese
 But the Fuzzy was the finest o the lot

 We never got a haporths change of im
 E squatted in the scrub an ocked our orses
 E cut our sentries up at Suakim
 An e played the cat an banjo with our forces

 So eres to you FuzzyWuzzy at your ome in the Soudan
 Youre a pore benighted eathen but a firstclass fightin man
 We gives you your certificate an if you want it signed
 Well come an ave a romp with you whenever youre inclined

 We took our chanst among the Khyber ills
 The Boers knocked us silly at a mile
 The Burman give us Irriwaddy chills
 An a Zulu impi dished us up in style
 But all we ever got from such as they
 Was pop to what the Fuzzy made us swaller
 We eld our bloomin own the papers say
 But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us oller

 Then eres to you FuzzyWuzzy an the missis and the kid
 Our orders was to break you an of course we went an did
 We sloshed you with Martinis an it wasnt ardly fair
 But for all the odds agin you FuzzyWuz you broke the square

 E asnt got no papers of is own
 E asnt got no medals nor rewards
 So we must certify the skill es shown
 In usin of is long twoanded swords
 When es oppin in an out among the bush
 With is coffineaded shield an shovelspear
 An appy day with Fuzzy on the rush
 Will last an ealthy Tommy for a year

 So eres to you FuzzyWuzzy an your friends which are no more
 If we adnt lost some messmates we would elp you to deplore
 But give an takes the gospel an well call the bargain fair
 For if you ave lost more than us you crumpled up the square

 E rushes at the smoke when we let drive
 An before we know es ackin at our ead
 Es all ot sand an ginger when alive
 An es generally shammin when es dead

 Es a daisy es a ducky es a lamb
 Es a injiarubber idiot on the spree

SCREWGUNS

 Smokin my pipe on the mountings
 sniffin the mornin cool
 I walks in my old brown gaiters
 along o my old brown mule
 With seventy gunners beind me
 an never a beggar forgets
 Its only the pick of the Army
 that handles the dear little petsTss Tss
 For you all love the screwgunsthe screwguns they all love you
 So when we call round with a few guns
 o course you will know what to dohoo hoo
 Jest send in your Chief an surrender
 its worse if you fights or you runs
 You can go where you please you can skid up the trees
 but you dont get away from the guns

 They sends us along where the roads are but mostly we goes where they aint
 Wed climb up the side of a signboard an trust to the stick o the paint
 Weve chivied the Naga an Looshai
 weve give the Afreedeeman fits
 For we fancies ourselves at two thousand
 we guns that are built in two bitsTss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns

 If a man doesnt work why we drills im
 an teaches im ow to behave
 If a beggar cant march why we kills im
 an rattles im into is grave
 Youve got to stand up to our business
 an spring without snatchin or fuss
 Dyou say that you sweat with the fieldguns
 By God you must lather with usTss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns

 The eagles is screamin around us
 the rivers amoanin below
 Were clear o the pine an the oakscrub
 were out on the rocks an the snow
 An the wind is as thin as a whiplash
 what carries away to the plains
 The rattle an stamp o the leadmules
 the jingletyjink o the chainsTss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns

 Theres a wheel on the Horns o the Mornin
 an a wheel on the edge o the Pit
 An a drop into nothin beneath you as straight as a beggar can spit
 With the sweat runnin out o your shirtsleeves
 an the sun off the snow in your face
 An arf o the men on the dragropes
 to hold the old gun in er placeTss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns

 Smokin my pipe on the mountings
 sniffin the mornin cool
 I climbs in my old brown gaiters
 along o my old brown mule
 The monkey can say what our road was
 the wildgoat e knows where we passed

 Stand easy you longeared old darlins
 Out dragropes With shrapnel Hold fastTss Tss

 For you all love the screwgunsthe screwguns they all love
 you
 So when we take tea with a few guns
 o course you will know what to dohoo hoo
 Jest send in your Chief an surrender
 its worse if you fights or you runs
 You may hide in the caves theyll be only your graves
 but you cant get away from the guns




GUNGA DIN

 You may talk o gin and beer
 When youre quartered safe out ere
 An youre sent to pennyfights an Aldershot it
 But when it comes to slaughter
 You will do your work on water
 An youll lick the bloomin boots of im thats got it

 Now in Injias sunny clime
 Where I used to spend my time
 Aservin of Er Majesty the Queen
 Of all them blackfaced crew
 The finest man I knew
 Was our regimental bhisti Gunga Din

 He was Din Din Din
 You limpin lump o brickdust Gunga Din
 Hi slippy hitherao
 Water get it Panee lao1
 You squidgynosed old idol Gunga Din

 The uniform e wore
 Was nothin much before
 An rather less than arf o that beind
 For a piece o twisty rag
 An a goatskin waterbag
 Was all the fieldequipment e could find

 When the sweatin trooptrain lay
 In a sidin through the day
 Where the eat would make your bloomin eyebrows crawl
 We shouted Harry By 2
 Till our throats were brickydry
 Then we wopped im cause e couldnt serve us all

 It was Din Din Din
 You eathen where the mischief ave you been
 You put some juldee 3 in it
 Or Ill marrow 4 you this minute
 If you dont fill up my helmet Gunga Din

 E would dot an carry one
 Till the longest day was done
 An e didnt seem to know the use o fear

 If we charged or broke or cut
 You could bet your bloomin nut
 Ed be waitin fifty paces right flank rear
 With is mussick 5 on is back
 E would skip with our attack
 An watch us till the bugles made Retire
 An for all is dirty ide
 E was white clear white inside
 When e went to tend the wounded under fire
 It was Din Din Din
 With the bullets kickin dustspots on the green

 When the cartridges ran out
 You could hear the frontfiles shout
 Hi ammunitionmules an Gunga Din

 I shant forgit the night
 When I dropped beind the fight
 With a bullet where my beltplate should a been
 I was chokin mad with thirst
 An the man that spied me first
 Was our good old grinnin gruntin Gunga Din
 E lifted up my ead
 An he plugged me where I bled
 An e guv me arfapint o watergreen
 It was crawlin and it stunk
 But of all the drinks Ive drunk
 Im gratefullest to one from Gunga Din

 It was Din Din Din
 Eres a beggar with a bullet through is spleen
 Es chawin up the ground
 An es kickin all around
 For Gawds sake git the water Gunga Din

 E carried me away
 To where a dooli lay
 An a bullet come an drilled the beggar clean
 E put me safe inside
 An just before e died
 I ope you liked your drink sez Gunga Din
 So Ill meet im later on
 At the place where e is gone
 Where its always double drill and no canteen
 Ell be squattin on the coals
 Givin drink to poor damned souls
 An Ill get a swig in hell from Gunga Din
 Yes Din Din Din
 You Lazarushianleather Gunga Din
 Though Ive belted you and flayed you
 By the livin Gawd that made you
 Youre a better man than I am Gunga Din

OONTS
 Northern India Transport Train

 Wot makes the soldiers eart to penk wot makes im to perspire
 It isnt standin up to charge nor lyin down to fire
 But its everlastin waitin on a everlastin road
 For the commissariat camel an is commissariat load
 O the oont 1 O the oont O the commissariat oont
 With is silly neck abobbin like a basket full o snakes
 We packs im like an idol an you ought to ear im grunt
 An when we gets im loaded up is blessed girthrope breaks

 Wot makes the rearguard swear so ard when night is drorin in
 An every native follower is shiverin for is skin
 It aint the chanst o being rushed by Paythans from the ills
 Its the commissariat camel puttin on is bloomin frills
 O the oont O the oont O the hairy scary oont
 Atrippin over tentropes when weve got the night alarm
 We socks im with a stretcherpole an eads im off in front
 An when weve saved is bloomin life e chaws our bloomin arm

 The orse e knows above a bit the bullocks but a fool
 The elephants a gentleman the batterymules a mule
 But the commissariat camuel when all is said an done
 Es a devil an a ostrich an a orphanchild in one
 O the oont O the oont O the Gawdforsaken oont
 The lumpyumpy umminbird asingin where e lies
 Es blocked the whole division from the rearguard to the front
 An when we get him up againthe beggar goes an dies

 Ell gall an chafe an lame an fighte smells most awful vile
 Ell lose isself for ever if you let im stray a mile
 Es game to graze the ole day long an owl the ole night through
 An when e comes to greasy ground e splits isself in two
 O the oont O the oont O the floppin droppin oont
 When is long legs give from under an is meltin eye is dim
 The tribes is up beind us and the tribes is out in front
 It aint no jam for Tommy but its kites an crows for im

 So when the cruel march is done an when the roads is blind
 An when we sees the camp in front an ears the shots beind
 Ho then we strips is saddle off and all is woes is past
 E thinks on us that used im so and gets revenge at last
 O the oont O the oont O the floatin bloatin oont
 The late lamented camel in the watercut e lies
 We keeps a mile beind im an we keeps a mile in front
 But e gets into the drinkincasks and then o course we dies

 1 Cameloo is pronounced like u in bull but by Mr Atkins to
 rhyme with front




LOOT

 If youve ever stole a pheasantegg beind the keepers back
 If youve ever snigged the washin from the line
 If youve ever crammed a gander in your bloomin aversack
 You will understand this little song o mine

 But the service rules are ard an from such we are debarred
 For the same with English morals does not suit

 Cornet Toot toot
 Wy they call a man a robber if e stuffs is marchin clobber
 With the
 Chorus Loo loo Lulu lulu Loo loo Loot loot loot

 Bloomin loot
 Thats the thing to make the boys git up an shoot
 Its the same with dogs an men
 If youd make em come again
 Clap em forward with a Loo loo Lulu Loot

 If youve knocked a nigger edgeways when es thrustin for your life
 You must leave im very careful where e fell
 An may thank your stars an gaiters if you didnt feel is knife
 That you aint told off to bury im as well

 Then the sweatin Tommies wonder as they spade the beggars under
 Why lootin should be entered as a crime
 So if my song youll ear I will learn you plain an clear
 Ow to pay yourself for fightin overtime

 Chorus With the loot

 Now remember when youre acking round a gilded Burma god
 That is eyes is very often precious stones
 An if you treat a nigger to a dose o cleaninrod

 Where you ear it answer ollow to the boot

 When the ground begins to sink shove your baynick down the chink

 When youve turned em inside out an it seems beyond a doubt
 As if there werent enough to dust a flute
 Cornet Toot toot
 Before you sling your ook at the ousetops take a look
 For its underneath the tiles they ide the loot

SNARLEYOW

 This appened in a battle to a battry of the corps
 Which is first among the women an amazin first in war
 An what the bloomin battle was I dont remember now
 But Twos offlead e answered to the name o Snarleyow

 Down in the Infantry nobody cares
 Down in the Cavalry Colonel e swears
 But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
 Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog

 They was movin into action they was needed very sore
 To learn a little schoolin to a native army corps
 They ad nipped against an uphill they was tuckin down the brow
 When a tricky trundlin roundshot give the knock to Snarleyow

 They cut im loose an left ime was almost tore in two
 But he tried to follow after as a welltrained orse should do
 E went an fouled the limber an the Drivers Brother squeals
 Pull up pull up for Snarleyowis heads between is eels

 The Driver umped is shoulder for the wheels was goin round
 An there aint no Stop conductor when a battrys changin ground
 Sez e I broke the beggar in an very sad I feels
 But I couldnt pull up not for youyour ead between your eels

 E adnt ardly spoke the word before a droppin shell
 A little right the battry an between the sections fell
 An when the smoke ad cleared away before the limber wheels
 There lay the Drivers Brother with is ead between is eels

 Then sez the Drivers Brother an is words was very plain
 For Gawds own sake get over me an put me out o pain
 They saw is wounds was mortial an they judged that it was best
 So they took an drove the limber straight across is back an chest

 The Driver e give nothin cept a little coughin grunt
 But e swung is orses andsome when it came to Action Front
 An if one wheel was juicy you may lay your Monday head
 Twas juicier for the niggers when the case begun to spread

 The moril of this story it is plainly to be seen
 You avnt got no families when servin of the Queen
 You avnt got no brothers fathers sisters wives or sons
 If you want to win your battles take an work your bloomin guns

 Down in the Infantry nobody cares
 Down in the Cavalry Colonel e swears
 But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
 Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog

BELTS

 There was a row in Silver Street thats near to Dublin Quay
 Between an Irish regiment an English cavalree
 It started at Revelly an it lasted on till dark
 The first man dropped at Harrisons the last forninst the Park

 For it wasBelts belts belts an thats one for you
 An it was Belts belts belts an thats done for you
 O buckle an tongue
 Was the song that we sung
 From Harrisons down to the Park

 There was a row in Silver Streetthe regiments was out
 They called us Delhi Rebels an we answered Threes about
 That drew them like a hornets nestwe met them good an large
 The English at the double an the Irish at the charge

 Then it wasBelts

 There was a row in Silver Streetan I was in it too
 We passed the time o day an then the belts went whirraru
 I misremember what occurred but subsequint the storm
 A Freemans Journal Supplemint was all my uniform

 O it wasBelts




There was a row in Silver Streetthey sent the Polis there
 The English were too drunk to know the Irish didnt care
 But when they grew impertinint we simultaneous rose
 Till half o them was Liffey mud an half was tatthered cloes

 For it wasBelts

 There was a row in Silver Streetit might ha raged till now
 But some one drew his sidearm clear an nobody knew how
 Twas Hogan took the point an dropped we saw the red blood run
 An so we all was murderers that started out in fun

 While it wasBelts

 There was a row in Silver Streetbut that put down the shine
 Wid each man whisperin to his next Twas never work o mine
 We went away like beaten dogs an down the street we bore him
 The poor dumb corpse that couldnt tell the bhoys were sorry for him

 When it wasBelts

 There was a row in Silver Streetit isnt over yet
 For half of us are under guard wid punishments to get
 Tis all a merricle to me as in the Clink I lie
 There was a row in Silver Streetbegod I wonder why

 But it wasBelts belts belts an thats one for you
 An it was Belts belts belts an thats done for you
 O buckle an tongue
 Was the song that we sung
 From Harrisons down to the Park




THE YOUNG BRITISH SOLDIER

 When the arfmade recruity goes out to the East
 E acts like a babe an e drinks like a beast
 An e wonders because e is frequent deceased
 Ere es fit for to serve as a soldier

 Serve serve serve as a soldier
 Serve serve serve as a soldier
 Serve serve serve as a soldier
 Sooldier of the Queen

 Now all you recruities whats drafted today
 You shut up your ragbox an ark to my lay
 An Ill sing you a soldier as far as I may
 A soldier whats fit for a soldier

 Fit fit fit for a soldier

 First mind you steer clear o the grogsellers huts
 For they sell you Fixed Baynets that rots out your guts
 Ay drink that ud eat the live steel from your butts
 An its bad for the young British soldier

 Bad bad bad for the soldier

 When the cholera comesas it will past a doubt
 Keep out of the wet and dont go on the shout
 For the sickness gets in as the liquor dies out
 An it crumples the young British soldier

 Crum crum crumples the soldier

 But the worst o your foes is the sun overead
 You must wear your elmet for all that is said
 If e finds you uncovered ell knock you down dead
 An youll die like a fool of a soldier

 Fool fool fool of a soldier

 If youre cast for fatigue by a sergeant unkind
 Dont grouse like a woman nor crack on nor blind
 Be handy and civil and then you will find
 That its beer for the young British soldier

 Beer beer beer for the soldier

 Now if you must marry take care she is old
 A troopsergeants widows the nicest Im told
 For beauty wont help if your rations is cold
 Nor love aint enough for a soldier

 Nough nough nough for a soldier

 If the wife should go wrong with a comrade be loath
 To shoot when you catch emyoull swing on my oath
 Make im take er and keep er thats Hell for them both
 An youre shut o the curse of a soldier

 Curse curse curse of a soldier

 When first under fire an youre wishful to duck
 Dont look nor take eed at the man that is struck
 Be thankful youre livin and trust to your luck
 And march to your front like a soldier

 Front front front like a soldier

 When arf of your bullets fly wide in the ditch
 Dont call your Martini a crosseyed old bitch
 Shes human as you areyou treat her as sich
 An shell fight for the young British soldier

 Fight fight fight for the soldier

 When shakin their bustles like ladies so fine
 The guns o the enemy wheel into line
 Shoot low at the limbers an dont mind the shine
 For noise never startles the soldier

 Start start startles the soldier

 If your officers dead and the sergeants look white
 Remember its ruin to run from a fight
 So take open order lie down and sit tight
 And wait for supports like a soldier

 Wait wait wait like a soldier

 When youre wounded and left on Afghanistans plains
 And the women come out to cut up what remains
 Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains
 An go to your Gawd like a soldier

 Go go go like a soldier
 Go go go like a soldier
 Go go go like a soldier
 Sooldier of the Queen




MANDALAY

 By the old Moulmein Pagoda lookin lazy at the sea
 Theres a Burma girl asettin and I know she thinks o me
 For the wind is in the palmtrees and the templebells they say
 Come you back you British soldier come you back to Mandalay
 Come you back to Mandalay
 Where the old Flotilla lay
 Cant you ear their paddles chunkin from Rangoon to Mandalay
 On the road to Mandalay
 Where the flyinfishes play
 An the dawn comes up like thunder outer China crost the Bay

 Er petticoat was yaller an er little cap was green
 An er name was Supiyawlatjes the same as Theebaws Queen
 An I seed her first asmokin of a whackin white cheroot
 An awastin Christian kisses on an eathen idols foot
 Bloomin idol made omud
 Wot they called the Great Gawd Budd
 Plucky lot she cared for idols when I kissed er where she stud
 On the road to Mandalay

 When the mist was on the ricefields an the sun was droppin slow
 Shed git er little banjo an shed sing Kullalolo
 With er arm upon my shoulder an er cheek agin my cheek
 We useter watch the steamers an the hathis pilin teak
 Elephints apilin teak
 In the sludgy squdgy creek
 Where the silence ung that eavy you was arf afraid to speak
 On the road to Mandalay

 But thats all shove beind melong ago an fur away
 An there aint no busses runnin from the Bank to Mandalay
 An Im learnin ere in London what the tenyear soldier tells
 If youve eard the East acallin you wont never eed naught else
 No you wont eed nothin else
 But them spicy garlic smells
 An the sunshine an the palmtrees an the tinkly templebells
 On the road to Mandalay

 I am sick o wastin leather on these gritty pavinstones
 An the blasted Henglish drizzle wakes the fever in my bones
 Tho I walks with fifty ousemaids outer Chelsea to the Strand
 An they talks a lot o lovin but wot do they understand
 Beefy face an grubby and
 Law wot do they understand
 Ive a neater sweeter maiden in a cleaner greener land
 On the road to Mandalay

 Ship me somewheres east of Suez where the best is like the worst
 Where there arent no Ten Commandments an a man can raise a thirst
 For the templebells are callin an its there that I would be
 By the old Moulmein Pagoda looking lazy at the sea
 On the road to Mandalay
 Where the old Flotilla lay
 With our sick beneath the awnings when we went to Mandalay
 On the road to Mandalay
 Where the flyinfishes play
 An the dawn comes up like thunder outer China crost the Bay

ROUTE MARCHIN

 Were marchin on relief over Injias sunny plains
 A little front o Christmastime an just beind the Rains
 Ho get away you bullockman youve eard the bugle blowed
 Theres a regiment acomin down the Grand Trunk Road
 With its best foot first
 And the road asliding past
 An every bloomin campinground exactly like the last
 While the Big Drum says
 With is rowdydowdydow
 Kiko kissywarsti dont you hamsher argy jow 2

 Oh theres them Injian temples to admire when you see
 Theres the peacock round the corner an the monkey up the tree
 An theres that rummy silver grass awavin in the wind
 An the old Grand Trunk atrailin like a riflesling beind

 While its best foot first

 At halfpast fives Revelly an our tents they down must come
 Like a lot of button mushrooms when you pick em up at ome
 But its over in a minute an at six the column starts
 While the women and the kiddies sit an shiver in the carts

 An its best foot first

 Oh then its open order an we lights our pipes an sings
 An we talks about our rations an a lot of other things
 An we thinks o friends in England an we wonders what theyre at
 An ow they would admire for to hear us sling the bat1

 An its best foot first

 Its none so bad o Sunday when youre lyin at your ease
 To watch the kites awheelin round them feathereaded trees
 For although there aint no women yet there aint no barrickyards
 So the orficers goes shootin an the men they plays at cards

 Till its best foot first

 So ark an eed you rookies which is always grumblin sore
 Theres worser things than marchin from Umballa to Cawnpore
 An if your eels are blistered an they feels to urt like ell
 You drop some tallow in your socks an that will make em well

 For its best foot first

 Were marchin on relief over Injias coral strand
 Eight undred fightin Englishmen the Colonel and the Band

VOLUME III THE PHANTOM RICKSHAW AND OTHER GHOST STORIES




THE PHANTOM RICKSHAW

 May no ill dreams disturb my rest
 Nor Powers of Darkness me molest
 Evening Hymn

ONE of the few advantages that India has over England is a great
Knowability After five years service a man is directly or indirectly
acquainted with the two or three hundred Civilians in his Province all
the Messes of ten or twelve Regiments and Batteries and some fifteen
hundred other people of the nonofficial caste In ten years his
knowledge should be doubled and at the end of twenty he knows or knows
something about every Englishman in the Empire and may travel anywhere
and everywhere without paying hotelbills

Globetrotters who expect entertainment as a right have even within my
memory blunted this openheartedness but none the less today if you
belong to the Inner Circle and are neither a Bear nor a Black Sheep
all houses are open to you and our small world is very very kind and
helpful

Rickett of Kamartha stayed with Polder of Kumaon some fifteen years ago
He meant to stay two nights but was knocked down by rheumatic fever
and for six weeks disorganized Polders establishment stopped Polders
work and nearly died in Polders bedroom Polder behaves as though he
had been placed under eternal obligation by Rickett and yearly
sends the little Ricketts a box of presents and toys It is the same
everywhere The men who do not take the trouble to conceal from you
their opinion that you are an incompetent ass and the women who blacken
your character and misunderstand your wifes amusements will work
themselves to the bone in your behalf if you fall sick or into serious
trouble

Heatherlegh the Doctor kept in addition to his regular practice
a hospital on his private accountan arrangement of loose boxes for
Incurables his friend called itbut it was really a sort of fittingup
shed for craft that had been damaged by stress of weather The weather
in India is often sultry and since the tale of bricks is always a fixed
quantity and the only liberty allowed is permission to work overtime
and get no thanks men occasionally break down and become as mixed as
the metaphors in this sentence

Heatherlegh is the dearest doctor that ever was and his invariable
prescription to all his patients is lie low go slow and keep cool
He says that more men are killed by overwork than the importance of this
world justifies He maintains that overwork slew Pansay who died under
his hands about three years ago He has of course the right to speak
authoritatively and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack
in Pansays head and a little bit of the Dark World came through and
pressed him to death Pansay went off the handle says Heatherlegh
after the stimulus of long leave at Home He may or he may not have
behaved like a blackguard to Mrs KeithWessington My notion is that
the work of the Katabundi Settlement ran him off his legs and that he
took to brooding and making much of an ordinary P  0 flirtation He
certainly was engaged to Miss Mannering and she certainly broke off the
engagement Then he took a feverish chill and all that nonsense about
ghosts developed Overwork started his illness kept it alight and
killed him poor devil Write him off to the Systemone man to take the
work of two and a half men

I do not believe this I used to sit up with Pansay sometimes when
Heatherlegh was called out to patients and I happened to be within
claim The man would make me most unhappy by describing in a low even
voice the procession that was always passing at the bottom of his bed
He had a sick mans command of language

When he recovered I suggested that he should write out the whole affair
from beginning to end knowing that ink might assist him to ease his
mind When little boys have learned a new bad word they are never happy
till they have chalked it up on a door And this also is Literature

He was in a high fever while he was writing and the bloodandthunder
Magazine diction he adopted did not calm him Two months afterward
he was reported fit for duty but in spite of the fact that he was
urgently needed to help an undermanned Commission stagger through a
deficit he preferred to die vowing at the last that he was hagridden
I got his manuscript before he died and this is his version of the
affair dated 1885

My doctor tells me that I need rest and change of air It is not
improbable that I shall get both ere longrest that neither the
redcoated messenger nor the midday gun can break and change of air
far beyond that which any homewardbound steamer can give me In the
meantime I am resolved to stay where I am and in flat defiance of my
doctors orders to take all the world into my confidence You shall
learn for yourselves the precise nature of my malady and shall too
judge for yourselves whether any man born of woman on this weary earth
was ever so tormented as I

Speaking now as a condemned criminal might speak ere the dropbolts are
drawn my story wild and hideously improbable as it may appear
demands at least attention That it will ever receive credence I utterly
disbelieve Two months ago I should have scouted as mad or drunk the man
who had dared tell me the like Two months ago I was the happiest man in
India Today from Peshawur to the sea there is no one more wretched
My doctor and I are the only two who know this His explanation is that
my brain digestion and eyesight are all slightly affected giving rise
to my frequent and persistent delusions Delusions indeed I call him
a fool but he attends me still with the same unwearied smile the same
bland professional manner the same neatly trimmed red whiskers till I
begin to suspect that I am an ungrateful eviltempered invalid But you
shall judge for yourselves

Three years ago it was my fortunemy great misfortuneto sail
from Gravesend to Bombay on return from long leave with one Agnes
KeithWessington wife of an officer on the Bombay side It does not in
the least concern you to know what manner of woman she was Be content
with the knowledge that ere the voyage had ended both she and I were
desperately and unreasoningly in love with one another Heaven knows
that I can make the admission now without one particle of vanity In
matters of this sort there is always one who gives and another who
accepts From the first day of our illomened attachment I was
conscious that Agness passion was a stronger a more dominant andif
I may use the expressiona purer sentiment than mine Whether she
recognized the fact then I do not know Afterward it was bitterly plain
to both of us

Arrived at Bombay in the spring of the year we went our respective
ways to meet no more for the next three or four months when my leave
and her love took us both to Simla There we spent the season together
and there my fire of straw burned itself out to a pitiful end with the
closing year I attempt no excuse I make no apology Mrs Wessington
had given up much for my sake and was prepared to give up all From my
own lips in August 1882 she learned that I was sick of her presence
tired of her company and weary of the sound of her voice Ninetynine
women out of a hundred would have wearied of me as I wearied of them
seventyfive of that number would have promptly avenged themselves by
active and obtrusive flirtation with other men Mrs Wessington was the
hundredth On her neither my openly expressed aversion nor the cutting
brutalities with which I garnished our interviews had the least effect
Jack darling was her one eternal cuckoo cry Im sure its all a
mistakea hideous mistake and well be good friends again some day
Please forgive me Jack dear

I was the offender and I knew it That knowledge transformed my pity
into passive endurance and eventually into blind hatethe same
instinct I suppose which prompts a man to savagely stamp on the spider
he has but half killed And with this hate in my bosom the season of
1882 came to an end

Next year we met again at Simlashe with her monotonous face and timid
attempts at reconciliation and I with loathing of her in every fibre of
my frame Several times I could not avoid meeting her alone and on each
occasion her words were identically the same Still the unreasoning wail
that it was all a mistake and still the hope of eventually making
friends I might have seen had I cared to look that that hope only was
keeping her alive She grew more wan and thin month by month You will
agree with me at least that such conduct would have driven any one to
despair It was uncalled for childish unwomanly I maintain that she
was much to blame And again sometimes in the black feverstricken
nightwatches I have begun to think that I might have been a little
kinder to her But that really is a delusion I could not have
continued pretending to love her when I didnt could I It would have
been unfair to us both

Last year we met againon the same terms as before The same weary
appeal and the same curt answers from my lips At least I would make
her see how wholly wrong and hopeless were her attempts at resuming the
old relationship As the season wore on we fell apartthat is to say
she found it difficult to meet me for I had other and more absorbing
interests to attend to When I think it over quietly in my sickroom
the season of 1884 seems a confused nightmare wherein light and shade
were fantastically intermingledmy courtship of little Kitty Mannering
my hopes doubts and fears our long rides together my trembling
avowal of attachment her reply and now and again a vision of a white
face flitting by in the rickshaw with the black and white liveries
I once watched for so earnestly the wave of Mrs Wessingtons gloved
hand and when she met me alone which was but seldom the irksome
monotony of her appeal I loved Kitty Mannering honestly heartily
loved her and with my love for her grew my hatred for Agnes In August
Kitty and I were engaged The next day I met those accursed magpie
jhampanies at the back of Jakko and moved by some passing sentiment of
pity stopped to tell Mrs Wessington everything She knew it already

So I hear youre engaged Jack dear Then without a moments
pauseIm sure its all a mistakea hideous mistake We shall be as
good friends some day Jack as we ever were

My answer might have made even a man wince It cut the dying woman
before me like the blow of a whip Please forgive me Jack I didnt
mean to make you angry but its true its true

And Mrs Wessington broke down completely I turned away and left her to
finish her journey in peace feeling but only for a moment or two that
I had been an unutterably mean hound I looked back and saw that she
had turned her rickshaw with the idea I suppose of overtaking me

The scene and its surroundings were photographed on my memory

The rainswept sky we were at the end of the wet weather the sodden
dingy pines the muddy road and the black powderriven cliffs formed
a gloomy background against which the black and white liveries of
the jhampanies the yellowpaneled rickshaw and Mrs Wessingtons
downbowed golden head stood out clearly She was holding her
handkerchief in her left hand and was leaning back exhausted against
the rickshaw cushions I turned my horse up a bypath near the Sanjowlie
Reservoir and literally ran away Once I fancied I heard a faint call
of Jack This may have been imagination I never stopped to verify it
Ten minutes later I came across Kitty on horseback and in the delight
of a long ride with her forgot all about the interview

A week later Mrs Wessington died and the inexpressible burden of her
existence was removed from my life I went Plainsward perfectly happy
Before three months were over I had forgotten all about her except
that at times the discovery of some of her old letters reminded me
unpleasantly of our bygone relationship By January I had disinterred
what was left of our correspondence from among my scattered belongings
and had burned it At the beginning of April of this year 1885 I was
at Simlasemideserted Simlaonce more and was deep in lovers talks
and walks with Kitty It was decided that we should be married at the
end of June You will understand therefore that loving Kitty as I
did I am not saying too much when I pronounce myself to have been at
that time the happiest man in India

Fourteen delightful days passed almost before I noticed their flight

Then aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortals
circumstanced as we were I pointed out to Kitty that an engagement ring
was the outward and visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl and
that she must forthwith come to Hamiltons to be measured for one Up to
that moment I give you my word we had completely forgotten so trivial
a matter To Hamiltons we accordingly went on the 15th of April 1885
Remember thatwhatever my doctor may say to the contraryI was then in
perfect health enjoying a wellbalanced mind and an absolute tranquil
spirit Kitty and I entered Hamiltons shop together and there
regardless of the order of affairs I measured Kitty for the ring in
the presence of the amused assistant The ring was a sapphire with two
diamonds We then rode out down the slope that leads to the Combermere
Bridge and Pelitis shop

While my Waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale and
Kitty was laughing and chattering at my sidewhile all Simla that is
to say as much of it as had then come from the Plains was grouped round
the Readingroom and Pelitis verandaI was aware that some one
apparently at a vast distance was calling me by my Christian name It
struck me that I had heard the voice before but when and where I could
not at once determine In the short space it took to cover the road
between the path from Hamiltons shop and the first plank of the
Combermere Bridge I had thought over half a dozen people who might have
committed such a solecism and had eventually decided that it must have
been singing in my ears Immediately opposite Pelitis shop my eye was
arrested by the sight of four jharnpanies in magpie livery pulling a
yellowpaneled cheap bazar rickshaw In a moment my mind flew back to
the previous season and Mrs Wessington with a sense of irritation and
disgust Was it not enough that the woman was dead and done with
without her black and white servitors reappearing to spoil the days
happiness Whoever employed them now I thought I would call upon and
ask as a personal favor to change her jhampanies livery I would hire
the men myself and if necessary buy their coats from off their backs
It is impossible to say here what a flood of undesirable memories their
presence evoked

Kitty I cried there are poor Mrs Wessingtons jhampanies turned up
again I wonder who has them now

Kitty had known Mrs Wessington slightly last season and had always
been interested in the sickly woman What Where she asked I cant
see them anywhere

Even as she spoke her horse swerving from a laden mule threw himself
directly in front of the advancing rickshaw I had scarcely time to
utter a word of warning when to my unutterable horror horse and rider
passed through men and carriage as if they had been thin air

Whats the matter cried Kitty what made you call out so foolishly
Jack If I am engaged I dont want all creation to know about it There
was lots of space between the mule and the veranda and if you think I
cant ride

There

Whereupon wilful Kitty set off her dainty little head in the air at a
handgallop in the direction of the Bandstand fully expecting as
she herself afterward told me that I should follow her What was the
matter Nothing indeed Either that I was mad or drunk or that Simla
was haunted with devils I reined in my impatient cob and turned round
The rickshaw had turned too and now stood immediately facing me near
the left railing of the Combermere Bridge

Jack Jack darling There was no mistake about the words this time
they rang through my brain as if they had been shouted in my ear Its
some hideous mistake Im sure Please forgive me jack and lets be
friends again

The rickshawhood had fallen back and inside as I hope and pray daily
for the death I dread by night sat Mrs KeithWessington handkerchief
in hand and golden head bowed on her breast

How long I stared motionless I do not know Finally I was aroused by
my syce taking the Walers bridle and asking whether I was ill From the
horrible to the commonplace is but a step I tumbled off my horse and
dashed half fainting into Pelitis for a glass of cherrybrandy There
two or three couples were gathered round the coffeetables discussing
the gossip of the day Their trivialities were more comforting to me
just then than the consolations of religion could have been I plunged
into the midst of the conversation at once chatted laughed and jested
with a face when I caught a glimpse of it in a mirror as white and
drawn as that of a corpse Three or four men noticed my condition and
evidently setting it down to the results of overmany pegs charitably
endeavoured to draw me apart from the rest of the loungers But I
refused to be led away I wanted the company of my kindas a child
rushes into the midst of the dinnerparty after a fright in the dark
I must have talked for about ten minutes or so though it seemed an
eternity to me when I heard Kittys clear voice outside inquiring for
me In another minute she had entered the shop prepared to roundly
upbraid me for failing so signally in my duties Something in my face
stopped her

Why Jack she cried what have you been doing What has happened
Are you ill Thus driven into a direct lie I said that the sun had
been a little too much for me It was close upon five oclock of a
cloudy April afternoon and the sun had been hidden all day I saw my
mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth attempted to recover
it blundered hopelessly and followed Kitty in a regal rage out of
doors amid the smiles of my acquaintances I made some excuse I have
forgotten what on the score of my feeling faint and cantered away to
my hotel leaving Kitty to finish the ride by herself

In my room I sat down and tried calmly to reason out the matter

Here was I Theobald Jack Pansay a welleducated Bengal Civilian in
the year of grace 1885 presumably sane certainly healthy driven in
terror from my sweethearts side by the apparition of a woman who had
been dead and buried eight months ago These were facts that I could
not blink Nothing was further from my thought than any memory of Mrs
Wessington when Kitty and I left Hamiltons shop Nothing was more
utterly commonplace than the stretch of wall opposite Pelitis It was
broad daylight The road was full of people and yet here look you
in defiance of every law of probability in direct outrage of Natures
ordinance there had appeared to me a face from the grave

Kittys Arab had gone through the rickshaw so that my first hope that
some woman marvelously like Mrs Wessington had hired the carriage and
the coolies with their old livery was lost Again and again I went round
this treadmill of thought and again and again gave up baffled and
in despair The voice was as inexplicable as the apparition I had
originally some wild notion of confiding it all to Kitty of begging her
to marry me at once and in her arms defying the ghostly occupant of the
rickshaw After all I argued the presence of the rickshaw is in
itself enough to prove the existence of a spectral illusion One may see
ghosts of men and women but surely never of coolies and carriages The
whole thing is absurd Fancy the ghost of a hillman

Next morning I sent a penitent note to Kitty imploring her to overlook
my strange conduct of the previous afternoon My Divinity was still very
wroth and a personal apology was necessary I explained with a fluency
born of nightlong pondering over a falsehood that I had been attacked
with sudden palpitation of the heartthe result of indigestion This
eminently practical solution had its effect and Kitty and I rode out
that afternoon with the shadow of my first lie dividing us

Nothing would please her save a canter round Jakko With my nerves still
unstrung from the previous night I feebly protested against the notion
suggesting Observatory Hill Jutogh the Boileaugunge roadanything
rather than the Jakko round Kitty was angry and a little hurt so I
yielded from fear of provoking further misunderstanding and we set out
together toward Chota Simla We walked a greater part of the way and
according to our custom cantered from a mile or so below the Convent
to the stretch of level road by the Sanjowlie Reservoir The wretched
horses appeared to fly and my heart beat quicker and quicker as we
neared the crest of the ascent My mind had been full of Mrs Wessington
all the afternoon and every inch of the Jakko road bore witness to our
oldtime walks and talks The bowlders were full of it the pines sang it
aloud overhead the rainfed torrents giggled and chuckled unseen over
the shameful story and the wind in my ears chanted the iniquity aloud

As a fitting climax in the middle of the level men call the Ladies
Mile the Horror was awaiting me No other rickshaw was in sightonly
the four black and white jhampanies the yellowpaneled carriage and
the golden head of the woman withinall apparently just as I had left
them eight months and one fortnight ago For an instant I fancied that
Kitty must see what I sawwe were so marvelously sympathetic in all
things Her next words undeceived meNot a soul in sight Come along
Jack and Ill race you to the Reservoir buildings Her wiry little
Arab was off like a bird my Waler following close behind and in this
order we dashed under the cliffs Half a minute brought us within fifty
yards of the rickshaw I pulled my Waler and fell back a little The
rickshaw was directly in the middle of the road and once more the Arab
passed through it my horse following Jack Jack dear Please forgive
me rang with a wail in my ears and after an intervalIts a
mistake a hideous mistake

I spurred my horse like a man possessed When I turned my head at
the Reservoir works the black and white liveries were still
waitingpatiently waitingunder the grey hillside and the wind
brought me a mocking echo of the words I had just heard Kitty bantered
me a good deal on my silence throughout the remainder of the ride I had
been talking up till then wildly and at random

To save my life I could not speak afterward naturally and from
Sanjowlie to the Church wisely held my tongue

I was to dine with the Mannerings that night and had barely time to
canter home to dress On the road to Elysium Hill I overheard two men
talking together in the duskIts a curious thing said one how
completely all trace of it disappeared You know my wife was insanely
fond of the woman never could see anything in her myself and wanted
me to pick up her old rickshaw and coolies if they were to be got for
love or money Morbid sort of fancy I call it but Ive got to do what
the Memsahib tells me

Would you believe that the man she hired it from tells me that all four
of the menthey were brothersdied of cholera on the way to Hardwar
poor devils and the rickshaw has been broken up by the man himself
Told me he never used a dead Memsahibs rickshaw Spoiled his luck
Queer notion wasnt it Fancy poor little Mrs Wessington spoiling any
ones luck except her own I laughed aloud at this point and my laugh
jarred on me as I uttered it So there were ghosts of rickshaws after
all and ghostly employments in the other world How much did Mrs
Wessington give her men What were their hours Where did they go

And for visible answer to my last question I saw the infernal Thing
blocking my path in the twilight The dead travel fast and by short
cuts unknown to ordinary coolies I laughed aloud a second time and
checked my laughter suddenly for I was afraid I was going mad Mad to
a certain extent I must have been for I recollect that I reined in my
horse at the head of the rickshaw and politely wished Mrs Wessington
Good evening Her answer was one I knew only too well I listened
to the end and replied that I had heard it all before but should
be delighted if she had anything further to say Some malignant devil
stronger than I must have entered into me that evening for I have a dim
recollection of talking the commonplaces of the day for five minutes to
the Thing in front of me

Mad as a hatter poor devilor drunk Max try and get him to come
home

Surely that was not Mrs Wessingtons voice The two men had overheard
me speaking to the empty air and had returned to look after me They
were very kind and considerate and from their words evidently gathered
that I was extremely drunk I thanked them confusedly and cantered away
to my hotel there changed and arrived at the Mannerings ten minutes
late I pleaded the darkness of the night as an excuse was rebuked by
Kitty for my unloverlike tardiness and sat down

The conversation had already become general and under cover of it I
was addressing some tender small talk to my sweetheart when I was aware
that at the further end of the table a short redwhiskered man was
describing with much broidery his encounter with a mad unknown that
evening

A few sentences convinced me that he was repeating the incident of half
an hour ago In the middle of the story he looked round for applause as
professional storytellers do caught my eye and straightway collapsed
There was a moments awkward silence and the redwhiskered man muttered
something to the effect that he had forgotten the rest thereby
sacrificing a reputation as a good storyteller which he had built
up for six seasons past I blessed him from the bottom of my heart
andwent on with my fish

In the fulness of time that dinner came to an end and with genuine
regret I tore myself away from Kittyas certain as I was of my
own existence that It would be waiting for me outside the door The
redwhiskered man who had been introduced to me as Doctor Heatherlegh
of Simla volunteered to bear me company as far as our roads lay
together I accepted his offer with gratitude

My instinct had not deceived me It lay in readiness in the Mall and
in what seemed devilish mockery of our ways with a lighted headlamp
The redwhiskered man went to the point at once in a manner that showed
he bad been thinking over it all dinner time

I say Pansay what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on
the Elysium road The suddenness of the question wrenched an answer
from me before I was aware

That said I pointing to It

That may be either D T or Eyes for aught I know Now you dont
liquor I saw as much at dinner so it cant be D T Theres nothing
whatever where youre pointing though youre sweating and trembling
with fright like a scared pony Therefore I conclude that its Eyes
And I ought to understand all about them Come along home with me Im
on the Blessington lower road

To my intense delight the rickshaw instead of waiting for us kept
about twenty yards aheadand this too whether we walked trotted or
cantered In the course of that long night ride I had told my companion
almost as much as I have told you here

Well youve spoiled one of the best tales Ive ever laid tongue to
said he but Ill forgive you for the sake of what youve gone through
Now come home and do what I tell you and when Ive cured you
young man let this be a lesson to you to steer clear of women and
indigestible food till the day of your death

The rickshaw kept steady in front and my redwhiskered friend seemed
to derive great pleasure from my account of its exact whereabouts

Eyes Pansayall Eyes Brain and Stomach And the greatest of these
three is Stomach Youve too much conceited Brain too little Stomach
and thoroughly unhealthy Eyes Get your Stomach straight and the rest
follows And all thats French for a liver pill

Ill take sole medical charge of you from this hour for youre too
interesting a phenomenon to be passed over

By this time we were deep in the shadow of the Blessington lower road
and the rickshaw came to a dead stop under a pineclad overhanging
shale cliff Instinctively I halted too giving my reason Heatherlegh
rapped out an oath

Now if you think Im going to spend a cold night on the hillside
for the sake of a stomachcumBraincumEye illusionLord ha mercy
Whats that

There was a muffled report a blinding smother of dust just in front
of us a crack the noise of rent boughs and about ten yards of the
cliffsidepines undergrowth and allslid down into the road below
completely blocking it up The uprooted trees swayed and tottered for a
moment like drunken giants in the gloom and then fell prone among their
fellows with a thunderous crash Our two horses stood motionless and
sweating with fear As soon as the rattle of falling earth and stone had
subsided my companion mutteredMan if wed gone forward we should
have been ten feet deep in our graves by now There are more things
in heaven and earth Come home Pansay and thank God I want a peg
badly

We retraced our way over the Church Ridge and I arrived at Dr
Heatherleghs house shortly after midnight

His attempts toward my cure commenced almost immediately and for a week
I never left his sight Many a time in the course of that week did I
bless the good fortune which had thrown me in contact with Simlas best
and kindest doctor Day by day my spirits grew lighter and more equable
Day by day too I became more and more inclined to fall in with
Heatherleghs spectral illusion theory implicating eyes brain and
stomach I wrote to Kitty telling her that a slight sprain caused by a
fall from my horse kept me indoors for a few days and that I should be
recovered before she had time to regret my absence

Heatherleghs treatment was simple to a degree It consisted of liver
pills coldwater baths and strong exercise taken in the dusk or at
early dawnfor as he sagely observedA man with a sprained
ankle doesnt walk a dozen miles a day and your young woman might be
wondering if she saw you

At the end of the week after much examination of pupil and pulse and
strict injunction as to diet and pedestrianism Heatherlegh dismissed
me as brusquely as he had taken charge of me Here is his parting
benedictionMan I can certify to your mental cure and thats as
much as to say Ive cured most of your bodily ailments Now get your
traps out of this as soon as you can and be off to make love to Miss
Kitty

I was endeavoring to express my thanks for his kindness He cut me
short

Dont think I did this because I like you I gather that youve behaved
like a blackguard all through But all the same you re a phenomenon
and as queer a phenomenon as you are a blackguard Nochecking me
a second timenot a rupee please Go out and see if you can find the
eyesbrainandstomach business again Ill give you a lakh for each
time you see it

Half an hour later I was in the Mannerings drawingroom with
Kittydrunk with the intoxication of present happiness and the
foreknowledge that I should never more be troubled with Its hideous
presence Strong in the sense of my newfound security I proposed a
ride at once and by preference a canter round Jakko

Never had I felt so well so overladen with vitality and mere animal
spirits as I did on the afternoon of the 30th of April Kitty was
delighted at the change in my appearance and complimented me on it in
her delightfully frank and outspoken manner We left the Mannerings
house together laughing and talking and cantered along the Chota Simla
road as of old

I was in haste to reach the Sanjowlie Reservoir and there make my
assurance doubly sure The horses did their best but seemed all too
slow to my impatient mind Kitty was astonished at my boisterousness
Why Jack she cried at last you are behaving like a child What are
you doing

We were just below the Convent and from sheer wantonness I was making
my Waler plunge and curvet across the road as I tickled it with the loop
of my ridingwhip

Doing I answered nothing dear Thats just it If youd been doing
nothing for a week except lie up youd be as riotous as I

Singing and murmuring in your feastful mirth Joying to feel yourself
alive Lord over Nature Lord of the visible Earth Lord of the senses
five

My quotation was hardly out of my lips before we had rounded the corner
above the Convent and a few yards further on could see across to
Sanjowlie In the centre of the level road stood the black and white
liveries the yellowpaneled rickshaw and Mrs KeithWessington
I pulled up looked rubbed my eyes and I believe must have said
something The next thing I knew was that I was lying face downward on
the road with Kitty kneeling above me in tears

Has it gone child I gasped Kitty only wept more bitterly

Has what gone Jack dear what does it all mean There must be a
mistake somewhere Jack A hideous mistake Her last words brought me
to my feetmadraving for the time being

Yes there is a mistake somewhere I repeated a hideous mistake
Come and look at It

I have an indistinct idea that I dragged Kitty by the wrist along the
road up to where It stood and implored her for pitys sake to speak to
It to tell It that we were betrothed that neither Death nor Hell could
break the tie between us and Kitty only knows how much more to the
same effect Now and again I appealed passionately to the Terror in the
rickshaw to bear witness to all I had said and to release me from
a torture that was killing me As I talked I suppose I must have told
Kitty of my old relations with Mrs Wessington for I saw her listen
intently with white face and blazing eyes

Thank you Mr Pansay she said thats quite enough Syce ghora
lao

The syces impassive as Orientals always are had come up with the
recaptured horses and as Kitty sprang into her saddle I caught hold of
the bridle entreating her to hear me out and forgive My answer was the
cut of her ridingwhip across my face from mouth to eye and a word
or two of farewell that even now I cannot write down So I judged and
judged rightly that Kitty knew all and I staggered back to the side
of the rickshaw My face was cut and bleeding and the blow of the
ridingwhip had raised a livid blue wheal on it I had no selfrespect
Just then Heatherlegh who must have been following Kitty and me at a
distance cantered up

Doctor I said pointing to my face heres Miss Mannerings
signature to my order of dismissal andIll thank you for that lakh as
soon as convenient

Heatherleghs face even in my abject misery moved me to laughter

Ill stake my professional reputationhe began

Dont be a fool I whispered Ive lost my lifes happiness and youd
better take me home

As I spoke the rickshaw was gone Then I lost all knowledge of what was
passing The crest of Jakko seemed to heave and roll like the crest of a
cloud and fall in upon me

Seven days later on the 7th of May that is to say I was aware that I
was lying in Heatherleghs room as weak as a little child Heatherlegh
was watching me intently from behind the papers on his writingtable
His first words were not encouraging but I was too far spent to be much
moved by them

Heres Miss Kitty has sent back your letters You corresponded a good
deal you young people Heres a packet that looks like a ring and
a cheerful sort of a note from Mannering Papa which Ive taken the
liberty of reading and burning The old gentlemans not pleased with
you

And Kitty I asked dully

Rather more drawn than her father from what she says By the same token
you must have been letting out any number of queer reminiscences just
before I met you Says that a man who would have behaved to a woman as
you did to Mrs Wessington ought to kill himself out of sheer pity for
his kind Shes a hotheaded little virago your mash Will have it
too that you were suffering from D T when that row on the Jakko road
turned up Says shell die before she ever speaks to you again

I groaned and turned over to the other side

Now youve got your choice my friend This engagement has to be broken
off and the Mannerings dont want to be too hard on you Was it broken
through D T or epileptic fits Sorry I cant offer you a better
exchange unless youd prefer hereditary insanity Say the word and Ill
tell em its fits All Simla knows about that scene on the Ladies
Mile Come Ill give you five minutes to think over it

During those five minutes I believe that I explored thoroughly the
lowest circles of the Inferno which it is permitted man to tread on
earth And at the same time I myself was watching myself faltering
through the dark labyrinths of doubt misery and utter despair
I wondered as Heatherlegh in his chair might have wondered which
dreadful alternative I should adopt Presently I heard myself answering
in a voice that I hardly recognized Theyre confoundedly particular
about morality in these parts Give em fits Heatherlegh and my love
Now let me sleep a bit longer

Then my two selves joined and it was only I half crazed devildriven
I that tossed in my bed tracing step by step the history of the past
month

But I am in Simla I kept repeating to myself I Jack Pansay am in
Simla and there are no ghosts here Its unreasonable of that woman to
pretend there are Why couldnt Agnes have left me alone I never did
her any harm It might just as well have been me as Agnes Only Id
never have come back on purpose to kill her Why cant I be left
aloneleft alone and happy

It was high noon when I first awoke and the sun was low in the sky
before I sleptslept as the tortured criminal sleeps on his rack too
worn to feel further pain

Next day I could not leave my bed Heatherlegh told me in the morning
that he had received an answer from Mr Mannering and that thanks to
his Heatherleghs friendly offices the story of my affliction had
traveled through the length and breadth of Simla where I was on all
sides much pitied

And thats rather more than you deserve he concluded pleasantly
though the Lord knows youve been going through a pretty severe mill
Never mind well cure you yet you perverse phenomenon

I declined firmly to be cured Youve been much too good to me already
old man said I but I dont think I need trouble you further

In my heart I knew that nothing Heatherlegh could do would lighten the
burden that had been laid upon me

With that knowledge came also a sense of hopeless impotent rebellion
against the unreasonableness of it all There were scores of men no
better than I whose punishments had at least been reserved for another
world and I felt that it was bitterly cruelly unfair that I alone
should have been singled out for so hideous a fate This mood would in
time give place to another where it seemed that the rickshaw and I were
the only realities in a world of shadows that Kitty was a ghost that
Mannering Heatherlegh and all the other men and women I knew were all
ghosts and the great grey hills themselves but vain shadows devised
to torture me From mood to mood I tossed backward and forward for
seven weary days my body growing daily stronger and stronger until the
bedroom lookingglass told me that I had returned to everyday life and
was as other men once more Curiously enough my face showed no signs
of the struggle I had gone through It was pale indeed but as
expressionless and commonplace as ever I had expected some permanent
alterationvisible evidence of the disease that was eating me away I
found nothing

On the 15th of May I left Heatherleghs house at eleven oclock in the
morning and the instinct of the bachelor drove me to the Club There I
found that every man knew my story as told by Heatherlegh and was in
clumsy fashion abnormally kind and attentive Nevertheless I recognized
that for the rest of my natural life I should be among but not of my
fellows and I envied very bitterly indeed the laughing coolies on
the Mall below I lunched at the Club and at four oclock wandered
aimlessly down the Mall in the vague hope of meeting Kitty Close to
the Bandstand the black and white liveries joined me and I heard Mrs
Wessingtons old appeal at my side I had been expecting this ever since
I came out and was only surprised at her delay The phantom rickshaw
and I went side by side along the Chota Simla road in silence Close to
the bazar Kitty and a man on horseback overtook and passed us For any
sign she gave I might have been a dog in the road She did not even pay
me the compliment of quickening her pace though the rainy afternoon had
served for an excuse

So Kitty and her companion and I and my ghostly LightoLove crept
round Jakko in couples The road was streaming with water the pines
dripped like roofpipes on the rocks below and the air was full of
fine driving rain Two or three times I found myself saying to myself
almost aloud Im Jack Pansay on leave at Simlaat Simla Everyday
ordinary Simla I mustnt forget thatI mustnt forget that Then I
would try to recollect some of the gossip I had heard at the Club the
prices of SoandSos horsesanything in fact that related to
the workaday AngloIndian world I knew so well I even repeated the
multiplicationtable rapidly to myself to make quite sure that I was
not taking leave of my senses It gave me much comfort and must have
prevented my hearing Mrs Wessington for a time

Once more I wearily climbed the Convent slope and entered the level
road Here Kitty and the man started off at a canter and I was left
alone with Mrs Wessington Agnes said I will you put back your
hood and tell me what it all means The hood dropped noiselessly and
I was face to face with my dead and buried mistress She was wearing
the dress in which I had last seen her alive carried the same tiny
handkerchief in her right hand and the same cardcase in her left A
woman eight months dead with a cardcase I had to pin myself down to
the multiplicationtable and to set both hands on the stone parapet of
the road to assure myself that that at least was real

Agnes I repeated for pitys sake tell me what it all means Mrs
Wessington leaned forward with that odd quick turn of the head I used
to know so well and spoke

If my story had not already so madly overleaped the hounds of all human
belief I should apologize to you now As I know that no oneno not
even Kitty for whom it is written as some sort of justification of
my conductwill believe me I will go on Mrs Wessington spoke and
I walked with her from the Sanjowlie road to the turning below the
CommanderinChiefs house as I might walk by the side of any living
womans rickshaw deep in conversation The second and most tormenting
of my moods of sickness had suddenly laid hold upon me and like the
Prince in Tennysons poem I seemed to move amid a world of ghosts
There had been a gardenparty at the CommanderinChiefs and we two
joined the crowd of homewardbound folk As I saw them then it seemed
that they were the shadowsimpalpable fantastic shadowsthat divided
for Mrs Wessingtons rickshaw to pass through What we said during
the course of that weird interview I cannotindeed I dare nottell
Heatherleghs comment would have been a short laugh and a remark that I
had been mashing a braineyeandstomach chimera It was a ghastly and
yet in some indefinable way a marvelously dear experience Could it be
possible I wondered that I was in this life to woo a second time the
woman I had killed by my own neglect and cruelty

I met Kitty on the homeward roada shadow among shadows

If I were to describe all the incidents of the next fortnight in their
order my story would never come to an end and your patience would Be
exhausted Morning after morning and evening after evening the ghostly
rickshaw and I used to wander through Simla together Wherever I went
there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore me company
to and from my hotel At the Theatre I found them amid the crowd of
yelling jhampanies outside the Club veranda after a long evening of
whist at the Birthday Ball waiting patiently for my reappearance and
in broad daylight when I went calling Save that it cast no shadow the
rickshaw was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and
iron More than once indeed I have had to check myself from warning
some hardriding friend against cantering over it More than once I have
walked down the Mall deep in conversation with Mrs Wessington to the
unspeakable amazement of the passersby

Before I had been out and about a week I learned that the fit theory
had been discarded in favor of insanity However I made no change in my
mode of life I called rode and dined out as freely as ever I had
a passion for the society of my kind which I had never felt before I
hungered to be among the realities of life and at the same time I
felt vaguely unhappy when I had been separated too long from my ghostly
companion It would be almost impossible to describe my varying moods
from the 15th of May up to today

The presence of the rickshaw filled me by turns with horror blind
fear a dim sort of pleasure and utter despair I dared not leave
Simla and I knew that my stay there was killing me I knew moreover
that it was my destiny to die slowly and a little every day My only
anxiety was to get the penance over as quietly as might be Alternately
I hungered for a sight of Kitty and watched her outrageous flirtations
with my successorto speak more accurately my successorswith amused
interest She was as much out of my life as I was out of hers By day I
wandered with Mrs Wessington almost content By night I implored Heaven
to let me return to the world as I used to know it Above all these
varying moods lay the sensation of dull numbing wonder that the Seen
and the Unseen should mingle so strangely on this earth to hound one
poor soul to its grave

    

August 27Heatherlegh has been indefatigable in his attendance on me
and only yesterday told me that I ought to send in an application for
sick leave An application to escape the company of a phantom A request
that the Government would graciously permit me to get rid of five ghosts
and an airy rickshaw by going to England Heatherleghs proposition
moved me to almost hysterical laughter I told him that I should await
the end quietly at Simla and I am sure that the end is not far off
Believe me that I dread its advent more than any word can say and I
torture myself nightly with a thousand speculations as to the manner of
my death

Shall I die in my bed decently and as an English gentleman should die
or in one last walk on the Mall will my soul be wrenched from me to
take its place forever and ever by the side of that ghastly phantasm
Shall I return to my old lost allegiance in the next world or shall
I meet Agnes loathing her and bound to her side through all eternity
Shall we two hover over the scene of our lives till the end of Time
As the day of my death draws nearer the intense horror that all living
flesh feels toward escaped spirits from beyond the grave grows more and
more powerful It is an awful thing to go down quick among the dead with
scarcely onehalf of your life completed It is a thousand times more
awful to wait as I do in your midst for I know not what unimaginable
terror Pity me at least on the score of my delusion for I know you
will never believe what I have written here Yet as surely as ever a man
was done to death by the Powers of Darkness I am that man

In justice too pity her For as surely as ever woman was killed by
man I killed Mrs Wessington And the last portion of my punishment is
ever now upon me

    




MY OWN TRUE GHOST STORY

 As I came through the Desert thus it was
 As I came through the Desert
 The City of Dreadful Night

Somewhere in the Other World where there are books and pictures and
plays and shop windows to look at and thousands of men who spend their
lives in building up all four lives a gentleman who writes real stories
about the real insides of people and his name is Mr Walter Besant
But he will insist upon treating his ghostshe has published half
a workshopful of themwith levity He makes his ghostseers talk
familiarly and in some cases flirt outrageously with the phantoms
You may treat anything from a Viceroy to a Vernacular Paper with
levity but you must behave reverently toward a ghost and particularly
an Indian one

There are in this land ghosts who take the form of fat cold pobby
corpses and hide in trees near the roadside till a traveler passes
Then they drop upon his neck and remain There are also terrible ghosts
of women who have died in childbed These wander along the pathways at
dusk or hide in the crops near a village and call seductively But to
answer their call is death in this world and the next Their feet are
turned backward that all sober men may recognize them There are ghosts
of little children who have been thrown into wells These haunt well
curbs and the fringes of jungles and wail under the stars or catch
women by the wrist and beg to be taken up and carried These and the
corpse ghosts however are only vernacular articles and do not attack
Sahibs No native ghost has yet been authentically reported to have
frightened an Englishman but many English ghosts have scared the life
out of both white and black

Nearly every other Station owns a ghost There are said to be two
at Simla not counting the woman who blows the bellows at Syree
dakbungalow on the Old Road Mussoorie has a house haunted of a very
lively Thing a White Lady is supposed to do nightwatchman round a
house in Lahore Dalhousie says that one of her houses repeats on
autumn evenings all the incidents of a horrible horseandprecipice
accident Murree has a merry ghost and now that she has been swept
by cholera will have room for a sorrowful one there are Officers
Quarters in Mian Mir whose doors open without reason and whose
furniture is guaranteed to creak not with the heat of June but with
the weight of Invisibles who come to lounge in the chairs Peshawur
possesses houses that none will willingly rent and there is
somethingnot feverwrong with a big bungalow in Allahabad The older
Provinces simply bristle with haunted houses and march phantom armies
along their main thoroughfares

Some of the dakbungalows on the Grand Trunk Road have handy little
cemeteries in their compoundwitnesses to the changes and chances
of this mortal life in the days when men drove from Calcutta to the
Northwest These bungalows are objectionable places to put up in They
are generally very old always dirty while the khansamah is as ancient
as the bungalow He either chatters senilely or falls into the long
trances of age In both moods he is useless If you get angry with him
he refers to some Sahib dead and buried these thirty years and says
that when he was in that Sahibs service not a khansamah in the Province
could touch him Then he jabbers and mows and trembles and fidgets among
the dishes and you repent of your irritation

In these dakbungalows ghosts are most likely to be found and when
found they should be made a note of Not long ago it was my business to
live in dakbungalows I never inhabited the same house for three
nights running and grew to be learned in the breed I lived in
Governmentbuilt ones with red brick walls and rail ceilings an
inventory of the furniture posted in every room and an excited snake at
the threshold to give welcome I lived in converted onesold houses
officiating as dakbungalowswhere nothing was in its proper place
and there wasnt even a fowl for dinner I lived in secondhand
palaces where the wind blew through openwork marble tracery just as
uncomfortably as through a broken pane I lived in dakbungalows where
the last entry in the visitors book was fifteen months old and where
they slashed off the currykids head with a sword It was my good
luck to meet all sorts of men from sober traveling missionaries and
deserters flying from British Regiments to drunken loafers who threw
whisky bottles at all who passed and my still greater good fortune just
to escape a maternity case Seeing that a fair proportion of the tragedy
of our lives out here acted itself in dakbungalows I wondered that
I had met no ghosts A ghost that would voluntarily hang about a
dakbungalow would be mad of course but so many men have died mad in
dakbungalows that there must be a fair percentage of lunatic ghosts

In due time I found my ghost or ghosts rather for there were two of
them Up till that hour I had sympathized with Mr Besants method of
handling them as shown in The Strange Case of Mr Lucraft and Other
Stories I am now in the Opposition

We will call the bungalow Katmal dakbungalow But THAT was the smallest
part of the horror A man with a sensitive hide has no right to sleep in
dakbungalows He should marry Katmal dakbungalow was old and rotten
and unrepaired The floor was of worn brick the walls were filthy and
the windows were nearly black with grime It stood on a bypath largely
used by native SubDeputy Assistants of all kinds from Finance to
Forests but real Sahibs were rare The khansamah who was nearly bent
double with old age said so

When I arrived there was a fitful undecided rain on the face of the
land accompanied by a restless wind and every gust made a noise
like the rattling of dry bones in the stiff toddy palms outside The
khansamah completely lost his head on my arrival He had served a Sahib
once Did I know that Sahib He gave me the name of a wellknown man who
has been buried for more than a quarter of a century and showed me an
ancient daguerreotype of that man in his prehistoric youth I had seen a
steel engraving of him at the head of a double volume of Memoirs a month
before and I felt ancient beyond telling

The day shut in and the khansamah went to get me food He did not go
through the pretense of calling it khanamans victuals He said
ratub and that means among other things grubdogs rations
There was no insult in his choice of the term He had forgotten the
other word I suppose

While he was cutting up the dead bodies of animals I settled myself
down after exploring the dakbungalow There were three rooms beside
my own which was a corner kennel each giving into the other through
dingy white doors fastened with long iron bars The bungalow was a very
solid one but the partition walls of the rooms were almost jerrybuilt
in their flimsiness Every step or bang of a trunk echoed from my room
down the other three and every footfall came back tremulously from the
far walls For this reason I shut the door There were no lampsonly
candles in long glass shades An oil wick was set in the bathroom

For bleak unadulterated misery that dakbungalow was the worst of
the many that I had ever set foot in There was no fireplace and
the windows would not open so a brazier of charcoal would have been
useless The rain and the wind splashed and gurgled and moaned round the
house and the toddy palms rattled and roared

Half a dozen jackals went through the compound singing and a hyena
stood afar off and mocked them A hyena would convince a Sadducee of the
Resurrection of the Deadthe worst sort of Dead Then came the ratuba
curious meal half native and half English in compositionwith the old
khansamah babbling behind my chair about dead and gone English people
and the windblown candles playing shadowbopeep with the bed and the
mosquitocurtains It was just the sort of dinner and evening to make
a man think of every single one of his past sins and of all the others
that he intended to commit if he lived

Sleep for several hundred reasons was not easy The lamp in the
bathroom threw the most absurd shadows into the room and the wind was
beginning to talk nonsense

Just when the reasons were drowsy with bloodsucking I heard the
regularLetustakeandheavehimover grunt of dooliebearers
in the compound First one doolie came in then a second and then a
third I heard the doolies dumped on the ground and the shutter in
front of my door shook Thats some one trying to come in I said
But no one spoke and I persuaded myself that it was the gusty wind The
shutter of the room next to mine was attacked flung back and the inner
door opened Thats some SubDeputy Assistant I said and he has
brought his friends with him Now theyll talk and spit and smoke for an
hour

But there were no voices and no footsteps No one was putting his
luggage into the next room The door shut and I thanked Providence that
I was to be left in peace But I was curious to know where the doolies
had gone I got out of bed and looked into the darkness There was never
a sign of a doolie Just as I was getting into bed again I heard
in the next room the sound that no man in his senses can possibly
mistakethe whir of a billiard ball down the length of the slates when
the striker is stringing for break No other sound is like it A
minute afterwards there was another whir and I got into bed I was not
frightenedindeed I was not I was very curious to know what had become
of the doolies I jumped into bed for that reason

Next minute I heard the double click of a cannon and my hair sat up It
is a mistake to say that hair stands up The skin of the head tightens
and you can feel a faint prickly bristling all over the scalp That is
the hair sitting up

There was a whir and a click and both sounds could only have been made
by one thinga billiard ball I argued the matter out at great length
with myself and the more I argued the less probable it seemed that one
bed one table and two chairsall the furniture of the room next to
minecould so exactly duplicate the sounds of a game of billiards
After another cannon a threecushion one to judge by the whir I
argued no more I had found my ghost and would have given worlds to have
escaped from that dakbungalow I listened and with each listen the
game grew clearer

There was whir on whir and click on click Sometimes there was a double
click and a whir and another click Beyond any sort of doubt people
were playing billiards in the next room And the next room was not big
enough to hold a billiard table

Between the pauses of the wind I heard the game go forwardstroke
after stroke I tried to believe that I could not hear voices but that
attempt was a failure

Do you know what fear is Not ordinary fear of insult injury or death
but abject quivering dread of something that you cannot seefear that
dries the inside of the mouth and half of the throatfear that makes
you sweat on the palms of the hands and gulp in order to keep the uvula
at work This is a fine Feara great cowardice and must be felt to
be appreciated The very improbability of billiards in a dakbungalow
proved the reality of the thing No mandrunk or sobercould imagine a
game at billiards or invent the spitting crack of a screwcannon

A severe course of dakbungalows has this disadvantageit
breeds infinite credulity If a man said to a confirmed
dakbungalowhaunterThere is a corpse in the next room and theres
a mad girl in the next but one and the woman and man on that camel
have just eloped from a place sixty miles away the hearer would not
disbelieve because he would know that nothing is too wild grotesque or
horrible to happen in a dakbungalow

This credulity unfortunately extends to ghosts A rational person
fresh from his own house would have turned on his side and slept I
did not So surely as I was given up as a bad carcass by the scores
of things in the bed because the bulk of my blood was in my heart so
surely did I hear every stroke of a long game at billiards played in the
echoing room behind the ironbarred door My dominant fear was that the
players might want a marker It was an absurd fear because creatures
who could play in the dark would be above such superfluities I only
know that that was my terror and it was real

After a long long while the game stopped and the door banged I slept
because I was dead tired Otherwise I should have preferred to have kept
awake Not for everything in Asia would I have dropped the doorbar and
peered into the dark of the next room

When the morning came I considered that I had done well and wisely and
inquired for the means of departure

By the way khansamah I said what were those three doolies doing in
my compound in the night

There were no doolies said the khansamah

I went into the next room and the daylight streamed through the open
door I was immensely brave I would at that hour have played Black
Pool with the owner of the big Black Pool down below

Has this place always been a dakbungalow I asked

No said the khansamah Ten or twenty years ago I have forgotten how
long it was a billiard room

A how much

A billiard room for the Sahibs who built the Railway I was khansamah
then in the big house where all the RailwaySahibs lived and I used to
come across with brandyshrab These three rooms were all one and
they held a big table on which the Sahibs played every evening But
the Sahibs are all dead now and the Railway runs you say nearly to
Kabul

Do you remember anything about the Sahibs

It is long ago but I remember that one Sahib a fat man and always
angry was playing here one night and he said to meMangal Khan
brandypani do and I filled the glass and he bent over the table to
strike and his head fell lower and lower till it hit the table and his
spectacles came off and when wethe Sahibs and I myselfran to lift
him he was dead I helped to carry him out Aha he was a strong Sahib
But he is dead and I old Mangal Khan am still living by your favor

That was more than enough I had my ghosta firsthand authenticated
article I would write to the Society for Psychical ResearchI would
paralyze the Empire with the news But I would first of all put eighty
miles of assessed crop land between myself and that dakbungalow before
nightfall The Society might send their regular agent to investigate
later on

I went into my own room and prepared to pack after noting down the facts
of the case As I smoked I heard the game begin againwith a miss in
balk this time for the whir was a short one

The door was open and I could see into the room Clickclick That was
a cannon I entered the room without fear for there was sunlight within
and a fresh breeze without The unseen game was going on at a tremendous
rate And well it might when a restless little rat was running to and
fro inside the dingy ceilingcloth and a piece of loose windowsash was
making fifty breaks off the windowbolt as it shook in the breeze

Impossible to mistake the sound of billiard balls Impossible to mistake
the whir of a ball over the slate But I was to be excused Even when I
shut my enlightened eyes the sound was marvelously like that of a fast
game

Entered angrily the faithful partner of my sorrows Kadir Baksh

This bungalow is very bad and lowcaste No wonder the Presence was
disturbed and is speckled Three sets of dooliebearers came to the
bungalow late last night when I was sleeping outside and said that it
was their custom to rest in the rooms set apart for the English people
What honor has the khansamah They tried to enter but I told them to
go No wonder if these Oorias have been here that the Presence is
sorely spotted It is shame and the work of a dirty man

Kadir Baksh did not say that he had taken from each gang two annas for
rent in advance and then beyond my earshot had beaten them with the
big green umbrella whose use I could never before divine But Kadir
Baksh has no notions of morality

There was an interview with the khansamah but as he promptly lost his
head wrath gave place to pity and pity led to a long conversation
in the course of which he put the fat EngineerSahibs tragic death in
three separate stationstwo of them fifty miles away The third shift
was to Calcutta and there the Sahib died while driving a dogcart

If I had encouraged him the khansamah would have wandered all through
Bengal with his corpse

I did not go away as soon as I intended I stayed for the night while
the wind and the rat and the sash and the windowbolt played a dingdong
hundred and fifty up Then the wind ran out and the billiards stopped
and I felt that I had ruined my one genuine hallmarked ghost story

Had I only stopped at the proper time I could have made anything out of
it

That was the bitterest thought of all




THE STRANGE RIDE OF MORROWBIE JUKES

 Alive or deadthere is no other way
 Native Proverb

THERE is as the conjurers say no deception about this tale Jukes by
accident stumbled upon a village that is well known to exist though
he is the only Englishman who has been there A somewhat similar
institution used to flourish on the outskirts of Calcutta and there is
a story that if you go into the heart of Bikanir which is in the heart
of the Great Indian Desert you shall come across not a village but a
town where the Dead who did not die but may not live have established
their headquarters And since it is perfectly true that in the same
Desert is a wonderful city where all the rich money lenders retreat
after they have made their fortunes fortunes so vast that the owners
cannot trust even the strong hand of the Government to protect them
but take refuge in the waterless sands and drive sumptuous Cspring
barouches and buy beautiful girls and decorate their palaces with gold
and ivory and Minton tiles and motherofpearl I do not see why Jukess
tale should not be true He is a Civil Engineer with a head for plans
and distances and things of that kind and he certainly would not take
the trouble to invent imaginary traps He could earn more by doing his
legitimate work He never varies the tale in the telling and grows
very hot and indignant when he thinks of the disrespectful treatment
he received He wrote this quite straightforwardly at first but he has
since touched it up in places and introduced Moral Reflections thus

In the beginning it all arose from a slight attack of fever My work
necessitated my being in camp for some months between Pakpattan and
Muharakpura desolate sandy stretch of country as every one who has had
the misfortune to go there may know My coolies were neither more nor
less exasperating than other gangs and my work demanded sufficient
attention to keep me from moping had I been inclined to so unmanly a
weakness

On the 23d December 1884 I felt a little feverish There was a full
moon at the time and in consequence every dog near my tent was baying
it The brutes assembled in twos and threes and drove me frantic A few
days previously I had shot one loudmouthed singer and suspended his
carcass in terrorem about fifty yards from my tentdoor But his friends
fell upon fought for and ultimately devoured the body and as it
seemed to me sang their hymns of thanksgiving afterward with renewed
energy

The lightheartedness which accompanies fever acts differently on
different men My irritation gave way after a short time to a fixed
determination to slaughter one huge black and white beast who had been
foremost in song and first in flight throughout the evening Thanks to
a shaking hand and a giddy head I had already missed him twice with both
barrels of my shotgun when it struck me that my best plan would be to
ride him down in the open and finish him off with a hogspear This of
course was merely the semidelirious notion of a fever patient but I
remember that it struck me at the time as being eminently practical and
feasible

I therefore ordered my groom to saddle Pornic and bring him round
quietly to the rear of my tent When the pony was ready I stood at his
head prepared to mount and dash out as soon as the dog should again lift
up his voice Pornic by the way had not been out of his pickets for a
couple of days the night air was crisp and chilly and I was armed
with a specially long and sharp pair of persuaders with which I had been
rousing a sluggish cob that afternoon You will easily believe then
that when he was let go he went quickly In one moment for the brute
bolted as straight as a die the tent was left far behind and we were
flying over the smooth sandy soil at racing speed

In another we had passed the wretched dog and I had almost forgotten
why it was that I had taken the horse and hogspear

The delirium of fever and the excitement of rapid motion through the
air must have taken away the remnant of my senses I have a faint
recollection of standing upright in my stirrups and of brandishing my
hogspear at the great white Moon that looked down so calmly on my mad
gallop and of shouting challenges to the camelthorn bushes as they
whizzed past Once or twice I believe I swayed forward on Pornics
neck and literally hung on by my spursas the marks next morning
showed

The wretched beast went forward like a thing possessed over what seemed
to be a limitless expanse of moonlit sand Next I remember the ground
rose suddenly in front of us and as we topped the ascent I saw the
waters of the Sutlej shining like a silver bar below Then Pornic
blundered heavily on his nose and we rolled together down some unseen
slope

I must have lost consciousness for when I recovered I was lying on
my stomach in a heap of soft white sand and the dawn was beginning to
break dimly over the edge of the slope down which I had fallen As
the light grew stronger I saw that I was at the bottom of a horseshoe
shaped crater of sand opening on one side directly on to the shoals of
the Sutlej My fever had altogether left me and with the exception of
a slight dizziness in the head I felt no had effects from the fall over
night

Pornic who was standing a few yards away was naturally a good deal
exhausted but had not hurt himself in the least His saddle a favorite
polo one was much knocked about and had been twisted under his belly
It took me some time to put him to rights and in the meantime I had
ample opportunities of observing the spot into which I had so foolishly
dropped

At the risk of being considered tedious I must describe it at length
inasmuch as an accurate mental picture of its peculiarities will be of
material assistance in enabling the reader to understand what follows

Imagine then as I have said before a horseshoeshaped crater of sand
with steeply graded sand walls about thirtyfive feet high The slope
I fancy must have been about 65 degrees This crater enclosed a level
piece of ground about fifty yards long by thirty at its broadest part
with a crude well in the centre Round the bottom of the crater
about three feet from the level of the ground proper ran a series of
eightythree semicircular ovoid square and multilateral holes all
about three feet at the mouth Each hole on inspection showed that it
was carefully shored internally with driftwood and bamboos and over
the mouth a wooden dripboard projected like the peak of a jockeys
cap for two feet No sign of life was visible in these tunnels but a
most sickening stench pervaded the entire amphitheatrea stench fouler
than any which my wanderings in Indian villages have introduced me to

Having remounted Pornic who was as anxious as I to get back to camp I
rode round the base of the horseshoe to find some place whence an exit
would be practicable The inhabitants whoever they might be had not
thought fit to put in an appearance so I was left to my own devices My
first attempt to rush Pornic up the steep sandbanks showed me that
I had fallen into a trap exactly on the same model as that which the
antlion sets for its prey At each step the shifting sand poured down
from above in tons and rattled on the dripboards of the holes like
small shot A couple of ineffectual charges sent us both rolling down to
the bottom half choked with the torrents of sand and I was constrained
to turn my attention to the riverbank

Here everything seemed easy enough The sand hills ran down to the river
edge it is true but there were plenty of shoals and shallows across
which I could gallop Pornic and find my way back to terra firma by
turning sharply to the right or left As I led Pornic over the sands I
was startled by the faint pop of a rifle across the river and at the
same moment a bullet dropped with a sharp whit close to Pornics head

There was no mistaking the nature of the missilea regulation
MartiniHenry picket About five hundred yards away a countryboat was
anchored in midstream and a jet of smoke drifting away from its bows in
the still morning air showed me whence the delicate attention had come
Was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse The treacherous
sand slope allowed no escape from a spot which I had visited most
involuntarily and a promenade on the river frontage was the signal for
a bombardment from some insane native in a boat Im afraid that I lost
my temper very much indeed

Another bullet reminded me that I had better save my breath to cool
my porridge and I retreated hastily up the sands and back to the
horseshoe where I saw that the noise of the rifle had drawn sixtyfive
human beings from the badgerholes which I had up till that point
supposed to be untenanted I found myself in the midst of a crowd of
spectatorsabout forty men twenty women and one child who could not
have been more than five years old They were all scantily clothed in
that salmoncolored cloth which one associates with Hindu mendicants
and at first sight gave me the impression of a band of loathsome
fakirs The filth and repulsiveness of the assembly were beyond
all description and I shuddered to think what their life in the
badgerholes must be

Even in these days when local self government has destroyed the greater
part of a natives respect for a Sahib I have been accustomed to a
certain amount of civility from my inferiors and on approaching the
crowd naturally expected that there would be some recognition of my
presence As a matter of fact there was but it was by no means what I
had looked for

The ragged crew actually laughed at mesuch laughter I hope I may never
hear again They cackled yelled whistled and howled as I walked into
their midst some of them literally throwing themselves down on the
ground in convulsions of unholy mirth In a moment I had let go Pornics
head and irritated beyond expression at the mornings adventure
commenced cuffing those nearest to me with all the force I could The
wretches dropped under my blows like ninepins and the laughter gave
place to wails for mercy while those yet untouched clasped me round the
knees imploring me in all sorts of uncouth tongues to spare them

In the tumult and just when I was feeling very much ashamed of myself
for having thus easily given way to my temper a thin high voice
murmured in English from behind my shoulder Sahib Sahib Do you not
know me Sahib it is Gunga Dass the telegraphmaster

I spun round quickly and faced the speaker

Gunga Dass I have of course no hesitation in mentioning the mans
real name I had known four years before as a Deccanee Brahmin loaned by
the Punjab Government to one of the Khalsia States He was in charge
of a branch telegraphoffice there and when I had last met him was
a jovial fullstomached portly Government servant with a marvelous
capacity for making had puns in Englisha peculiarity which made
me remember him long after I had forgotten his services to me in his
official capacity It is seldom that a Hindu makes English puns

Now however the man was changed beyond all recognition Castemark
stomach slatecolored continuations and unctuous speech were all gone
I looked at a withered skeleton turbanless and almost naked with long
matted hair and deepset codfisheyes

But for a crescentshaped scar on the left cheekthe result of an
accident for which I was responsible I should never have known him
But it was indubitably Gunga Dass andfor this I was thankfulan
Englishspeaking native who might at least tell me the meaning of all
that I had gone through that day

The crowd retreated to some distance as I turned toward the miserable
figure and ordered him to show me some method of escaping from the
crate He held a freshly plucked crow in his hand and in reply to my
question climbed slowly on a platform of sand which ran in front of
the holes and commenced lighting a fire there in silence Dried bents
sandpoppies and driftwood burn quickly and I derived much consolation
from the fact that he lit them with an ordinary sulphurmatch When they
were in a bright glow and the crow was neatly spitted in front thereof
Gunga Dass began without a word of preamble

There are only two kinds of men Sar The alive and the dead When you
are dead you are dead but when you are alive you live Here the crow
demanded his attention for an instant as it twirled before the fire in
danger of being burned to a cinder If you die at home and do not die
when you come to the ghat to be burned you come here

The nature of the reeking village was made plain now and all that I had
known or read of the grotesque and the horrible paled before the fact
just communicated by the exBrahmin Sixteen years ago when I first
landed in Bombay I had been told by a wandering Armenian of the
existence somewhere in India of a place to which such Hindus as had
the misfortune to recover from trance or catalepsy were conveyed and
kept and I recollect laughing heartily at what I was then pleased to
consider a travelers tale

Sitting at the bottom of the sandtrap the memory of Watsons Hotel
with its swinging punkahs whiterobed attendants and the sallowfaced
Armenian rose up in my mind as vividly as a photograph and I burst
into a loud fit of laughter The contrast was too absurd

Gunga Dass as he bent over the unclean bird watched me curiously
Hindus seldom laugh and his surroundings were not such as to move Gunga
Dass to any undue excess of hilarity He removed the crow solemnly
from the wooden spit and as solemnly devoured it Then he continued his
story which I give in his own words

In epidemics of the cholera you are carried to be burned almost before
you are dead When you come to the riverside the cold air perhaps
makes you alive and then if you are only little alive mud is put on
your nose and mouth and you die conclusively If you are rather more
alive more mud is put but if you are too lively they let you go
and take you away I was too lively and made protestation with anger
against the indignities that they endeavored to press upon me In those
days I was Brahmin and proud man

Now I am dead man and eathere he eyed the wellgnawed breast
bone with the first sign of emotion that I had seen in him since we
metcrows and other things They took me from my sheets when they saw
that I was too lively and gave me medicines for one week and I survived
successfully Then they sent me by rail from my place to Okara Station
with a man to take care of me and at Okara Station we met two other
men and they conducted we three on camels in the night from Okara
Station to this place and they propelled me from the top to the bottom
and the other two succeeded and I have been here ever since two and a
half years Once I was Brahmin and proud man and now I eat crows

There is no way of getting out

None of what kind at all When I first came I made experiments
frequently and all the others also but we have always succumbed to the
sand which is precipitated upon our heads

But surely I broke in at this point the riverfront is open and
it is worth while dodging the bullets while at nightI had already
matured a rough plan of escape which a natural instinct of selfishness
forbade me sharing with Gunga Dass He however divined my
unspoken thought almost as soon as it was formed and to my intense
astonishment gave vent to a long low chuckle of derisionthe laughter
be it understood of a superior or at least of an equal

You will nothe had dropped the Sir completely after his opening
sentencemake any escape that way But you can try I have tried Once
only

The sensation of nameless terror and abject fear which I had in vain
attempted to strive against overmastered me completely My long fastit
was now close upon ten oclock and I had eaten nothing since tiffin on
the previous daycombined with the violent and unnatural agitation of
the ride had exhausted me and I verily believe that for a few minutes
I acted as one mad I hurled myself against the pitiless sandslope I
ran round the base of the crater blaspheming and praying by turns I
crawled out among the sedges of the riverfront only to be driven back
each time in an agony of nervous dread by the riflebullets which cut
up the sand round mefor I dared not face the death of a mad dog among
that hideous crowdand finally fell spent and raving at the curb of
the well No one had taken the slightest notion of an exhibition which
makes me blush hotly even when I think of it now

Two or three men trod on my panting body as they drew water but they
were evidently used to this sort of thing and had no time to waste
upon me The situation was humiliating Gunga Dass indeed when he had
banked the embers of his fire with sand was at some pains to throw half
a cupful of fetid water over my head an attention for which I could
have fallen on my knees and thanked him but he was laughing all the
while in the same mirthless wheezy key that greeted me on my first
attempt to force the shoals And so in a semicomatose condition I lay
till noon

Then being only a man after all I felt hungry and intimated as much
to Gunga Dass whom I had begun to regard as my natural protector
Following the impulse of the outer world when dealing with natives I
put my hand into my pocket and drew out four annas The absurdity of the
gift struck me at once and I was about to replace the money

Gunga Dass however was of a different opinion Give me the money
said he all you have or I will get help and we will kill you All
this as if it were the most natural thing in the world

A Britons first impulse I believe is to guard the contents of his
pockets but a moments reflection convinced me of the futility
of differing with the one man who had it in his power to make me
comfortable and with whose help it was possible that I might eventually
escape from the crater I gave him all the money in my possession Rs
985nine rupees eight annas and five piefor I always keep small
change as bakshish when I am in camp Gunga Dass clutched the coins and
hid them at once in his ragged loin cloth his expression changing to
something diabolical as he looked round to assure himself that no one
had observed us

Now I will give you something to eat said he

What pleasure the possession of my money could have afforded him I am
unable to say but inasmuch as it did give him evident delight I was not
sorry that I had parted with it so readily for I had no doubt that he
would have had me killed if I had refused One does not protest against
the vagaries of a den of wild beasts and my companions were lower than
any beasts While I devoured what Gunga Dass had provided a coarse
chapatti and a cupful of the foul wellwater the people showed not the
faintest sign of curiositythat curiosity which is so rampant as a
rule in an Indian village

I could even fancy that they despised me At all events they treated me
with the most chilling indifference and Gunga Dass was nearly as bad
I plied him with questions about the terrible village and received
extremely unsatisfactory answers So far as I could gather it had been
in existence from time immemorialwhence I concluded that it was at
least a century oldand during that time no one had ever been known to
escape from it I had to control myself here with both hands lest the
blind terror should lay hold of me a second time and drive me raving
round the crater Gunga Dass took a malicious pleasure in emphasizing
this point and in watching me wince Nothing that I could do would
induce him to tell me who the mysterious They were

It is so ordered he would reply and I do not yet know any one who
has disobeyed the orders

Only wait till my servants find that I am missing I retorted and I
promise you that this place shall be cleared off the face of the earth
and Ill give you a lesson in civility too my friend

Your servants would be torn in pieces before they came near this place
and besides you are dead my dear friend It is not your fault of
course but none the less you are dead and buried

At irregular intervals supplies of food I was told were dropped down
from the land side into the amphitheatre and the inhabitants fought for
them like wild beasts When a man felt his death coming on he retreated
to his lair and died there The body was sometimes dragged out of the
hole and thrown on to the sand or allowed to rot where it lay

The phrase thrown on to the sand caught my attention and I asked
Gunga Dass whether this sort of thing was not likely to breed a
pestilence

That said he with another of his wheezy chuckles you may see for
yourself subsequently You will have much time to make observations

Whereat to his great delight I winced once more and hastily continued
the conversationAnd how do you live here from day to day What do
you do The question elicited exactly the same answer as before coupled
with the information that this place is like your European heaven
there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage

Gunga Dass had been educated at a Mission School and as he himself
admitted had he only changed his religion like a wise man might have
avoided the living grave which was now his portion But as long as I was
with him I fancy he was happy

Here was a Sahib a representative of the dominant race helpless as
a child and completely at the mercy of his native neighbors In a
deliberate lazy way he set himself to torture me as a schoolboy would
devote a rapturous halfhour to watching the agonies of an impaled
beetle or as a ferret in a blind burrow might glue himself comfortably
to the neck of a rabbit The burden of his conversation was that there
was no escape of no kind whatever and that I should stay here till I
died and was thrown on to the sand If it were possible to forejudge
the conversation of the Damned on the advent of a new soul in their
abode I should say that they would speak as Gunga Dass did to me
throughout that long afternoon I was powerless to protest or answer
all my energies being devoted to a struggle against the inexplicable
terror that threatened to overwhelm me again and again I can compare
the feeling to nothing except the struggles of a man against the
overpowering nausea of the Channel passageonly my agony was of the
spirit and infinitely more terrible

As the day wore on the inhabitants began to appear in full strength to
catch the rays of the afternoon sun which were now sloping in at the
mouth of the crater They assembled in little knots and talked among
themselves without even throwing a glance in my direction About four
oclock as far as I could judge Gunga Dass rose and dived into his lair
for a moment emerging with a live crow in his hands The wretched bird
was in a most draggled and deplorable condition but seemed to be in no
way afraid of its master Advancing cautiously to the river front Gunga
Dass stepped from tussock to tussock until he had reached a smooth patch
of sand directly in the line of the boats fire The occupants of the
boat took no notice Here he stopped and with a couple of dexterous
turns of the wrist pegged the bird on its back with outstretched wings
As was only natural the crow began to shriek at once and beat the air
with its claws In a few seconds the clamor had attracted the attention
of a bevy of wild crows on a shoal a few hundred yards away where they
were discussing something that looked like a corpse Half a dozen crows
flew over at once to see what was going on and also as it proved to
attack the pinioned bird Gunga Dass who had lain down on a tussock
motioned to me to be quiet though I fancy this was a needless
precaution In a moment and before I could see how it happened a
wild crow who had grappled with the shrieking and helpless bird was
entangled in the latters claws swiftly disengaged by Gunga Dass and
pegged down beside its companion in adversity Curiosity it seemed
overpowered the rest of the flock and almost before Gunga Dass and I
had time to withdraw to the tussock two more captives were struggling
in the upturned claws of the decoys So the chaseif I can give it so
dignified a namecontinued until Gunga Dass had captured seven crows
Five of them he throttled at once reserving two for further operations
another day I was a good deal impressed by this to me novel method of
securing food and complimented Gunga Dass on his skill

It is nothing to do said he Tomorrow you must do it for me You are
stronger than I am

This calm assumption of superiority Upset me not a little and I
answered peremptorilyIndeed you old ruffian What do you think I
have given you money for

Very well was the unmoved reply Perhaps not tomorrow nor the day
after nor subsequently but in the end and for many years you will
catch crows and eat crows and you will thank your European God that you
have crows to catch and eat

I could have cheerfully strangled him for this but judged it best under
the circumstances to smother my resentment An hour later I was eating
one of the crows and as Gunga Dass had said thanking my God that I
had a crow to eat Never as long as I live shall I forget that evening
meal The whole population were squatting on the hard sand platform
opposite their dens huddled over tiny fires of refuse and dried rushes
Death having once laid his hand upon these men and forborne to strike
seemed to stand aloof from them now for most of our company were
old men bent and worn and twisted with years and women aged to all
appearance as the Fates themselves They sat together in knots and
talkedGod only knows what they found to discussin low equable tones
curiously in contrast to the strident babble with which natives are
accustomed to make day hideous Now and then an access of that sudden
fury which had possessed me in the morning would lay hold on a man or
woman and with yells and imprecations the sufferer would attack the
steep slope until baffled and bleeding he fell back on the platform
incapable of moving a limb The others would never even raise their
eyes when this happened as men too well aware of the futility of their
fellows attempts and wearied with their useless repetition I saw four
such outbursts in the course of the evening

Gunga Dass took an eminently businesslike view of my situation and
while we were diningI can afford to laugh at the recollection now but
it was painful enough at the timepropounded the terms on which he would
consent to do for me My nine rupees eight annas he argued at the
rate of three annas a day would provide me with food for fiftyone
days or about seven weeks that is to say he would be willing to cater
for me for that length of time At the end of it I was to look after
myself For a further considerationvidelicet my bootshe would be
willing to allow me to occupy the den next to his own and would supply
me with as much dried grass for bedding as he could spare

Very well Gunga Dass I replied to the first terms I cheerfully
agree but as there is nothing on earth to prevent my killing you as
you sit here and taking everything that you have I thought of the two
invaluable crows at the time I flatly refuse to give you my boots and
shall take whichever den I please

The stroke was a bold one and I was glad when I saw that it had
succeeded Gunga Dass changed his tone immediately and disavowed all
intention of asking for my boots At the time it did not strike me as at
all strange that I a Civil Engineer a man of thirteen years standing
in the Service and I trust an average Englishman should thus
calmly threaten murder and violence against the man who had for a
consideration it is true taken me under his wing I had left the world
it seemed for centuries I was as certain then as I am now of my own
existence that in the accursed settlement there was no law save that
of the strongest that the living dead men had thrown behind them every
canon of the world which had cast them out and that I had to depend
for my own life on my strength and vigilance alone The crew of the
illfated Mignonette are the only men who would understand my frame of
mind At present I argued to myself I am strong and a match for six
of these wretches It is imperatively necessary that I should for my
own sake keep both health and strength until the hour of my release
comesif it ever does

Fortified with these resolutions I ate and drank as much as I could
and made Gunga Dass understand that I intended to be his master and
that the least sign of insubordination on his part would be visited with
the only punishment I had it in my power to inflictsudden and violent
death Shortly after this I went to bed

That is to say Gunga Dass gave me a double armful of dried bents which
I thrust down the mouth of the lair to the right of his and followed
myself feet foremost the hole running about nine feet into the
sand with a slight downward inclination and being neatly shored with
timbers From my den which faced the riverfront I was able to watch
the waters of the Sutlej flowing past under the light of a young moon
and compose myself to sleep as best I might

The horrors of that night I shall never forget My den was nearly as
narrow as a coffin and the sides had been worn smooth and greasy by
the contact of innumerable naked bodies added to which it smelled
abominably Sleep was altogether out of question to one in my excited
frame of mind As the night wore on it seemed that the entire
amphitheatre was filled with legions of unclean devils that trooping up
from the shoals below mocked the unfortunates in their lairs

Personally I am not of an imaginative temperamentvery few Engineers
arebut on that occasion I was as completely prostrated with nervous
terror as any woman After half an hour or so however I was able once
more to calmly review my chances of escape Any exit by the steep sand
walls was of course impracticable I had been thoroughly convinced of
this some time before It was possible just possible that I might in
the uncertain moonlight safely run the gauntlet of the rifle shots The
place was so full of terror for me that I was prepared to undergo
any risk in leaving it Imagine my delight then when after creeping
stealthily to the riverfront I found that the infernal boat was not
there My freedom lay before me in the next few steps

By walking out to the first shallow pool that lay at the foot of the
projecting left horn of the horseshoe I could wade across turn
the flank of the crater and make my way inland Without a moments
hesitation I marched briskly past the tussocks where Gunga Dass had
snared the crows and out in the direction of the smooth white sand
beyond My first step from the tufts of dried grass showed me how
utterly futile was any hope of escape for as I put my foot down I
felt an indescribable drawing sucking motion of the sand below Another
moment and my leg was swallowed up nearly to the knee In the moonlight
the whole surface of the sand seemed to be shaken with devilish delight
at my disappointment I struggled clear sweating with terror and
exertion back to the tussocks behind me and fell on my face

My only means of escape from the semicircle was protected with a
quicksand

How long I lay I have not the faintest idea but I was roused at last
by the malevolent chuckle of Gunga Dass at my ear I would advise you
Protector of the Poor the ruffian was speaking English to return to
your house It is unhealthy to lie down here Moreover when the boat
returns you will most certainly be rifled at He stood over me in the
dim light of the dawn chuckling and laughing to himself Suppressing
my first impulse to catch the man by the neck and throw him on to the
quicksand I rose sullenly and followed him to the platform below the
burrows

Suddenly and futilely as I thought while I spoke I askedGunga Dass
what is the good of the boat if I cant get out anyhow I recollect
that even in my deepest trouble I had been speculating vaguely on the
waste of ammunition in guarding an already well protected foreshore

Gunga Dass laughed again and made answerThey have the boat only in
daytime It is for the reason that there is a way I hope we shall have
the pleasure of your company for much longer time It is a pleasant spot
when you have been here some years and eaten roast crow long enough

I staggered numbed and helpless toward the fetid burrow allotted to
me and fell asleep An hour or so later I was awakened by a piercing
screamthe shrill highpitched scream of a horse in pain Those who
have once heard that will never forget the sound I found some little
difficulty in scrambling out of the burrow When I was in the open I
saw Pornic my poor old Pornic lying dead on the sandy soil How they
had killed him I cannot guess Gunga Dass explained that horse was
better than crow and greatest good of greatest number is political
maxim We are now Republic Mister Jukes and you are entitled to a fair
share of the beast If you like we will pass a vote of thanks Shall I
propose

Yes we were a Republic indeed A Republic of wild beasts penned at the
bottom of a pit to eat and fight and sleep till we died I attempted
no protest of any kind but sat down and stared at the hideous sight
in front of me In less time almost than it takes me to write this
Pornics body was divided in some unclear way or other the men and
women had dragged the fragments on to the platform and were preparing
their normal meal Gunga Dass cooked mine The almost irresistible
impulse to fly at the sand walls until I was wearied laid hold of me
afresh and I had to struggle against it with all my might Gunga Dass
was offensively jocular till I told him that if he addressed another
remark of any kind whatever to me I should strangle him where he sat
This silenced him till silence became insupportable and I bade him say
something

You will live here till you die like the other Feringhi he said
coolly watching me over the fragment of gristle that he was gnawing

What other Sahib you swine Speak at once and dont stop to tell me a
lie

He is over there answered Gunga Dass pointing to a burrowmouth
about four doors ta the left of my own You can see for yourself He
died in the burrow as you will die and I will die and as all these men
and women and the one child will also die

For pitys sake tell me all you know about him Who was he When did he
come and when did he die

This appeal was a weak step on my part Gunga Dass only leered and
repliedI will notunless you give me something first

Then I recollected where I was and struck the man between the eyes
partially stunning him He stepped down from the platform at once and
cringing and fawning and weeping and attempting to embrace my feet led
me round to the burrow which he had indicated

I know nothing whatever about the gentleman Your God be my witness
that I do not He was as anxious to escape as you were and he was
shot from the boat though we all did all things to prevent him from
attempting He was shot here Gunga Dass laid his hand on his lean
stomach and bowed to the earth

Well and what then Go on

And thenand then Your Honor we carried him in to his house and
gave him water and put wet cloths on the wound and he laid down in his
house and gave up the ghost

In how long In how long

About half an hour after he received his wound I call Vishnu to
witness yelled the wretched man that I did everything for him
Everything which was possible that I did

He threw himself down on the ground and clasped my ankles But I had
my doubts about Gunga Dasss benevolence and kicked him off as he lay
protesting

I believe you robbed him of everything he had But I can find out in a
minute or two How long was the Sahib here

Nearly a year and a half I think he must have gone mad But hear me
swear Protector of the Poor Wont Your Honor hear me swear that I
never touched an article that belonged to him What is Your Worship
going to do

I had taken Gunga Dass by the waist and had hauled him on to the
platform opposite the deserted burrow As I did so I thought of my
wretched fellowprisoners unspeakable misery among all these horrors
for eighteen months and the final agony of dying like a rat in a hole
with a bulletwound in the stomach Gunga Dass fancied I was going
to kill him and howled pitifully The rest of the population in the
plethora that follows a full flesh meal watched us without stirring

Go inside Gunga Dass said I and fetch it out

I was feeling sick and faint with horror now Gunga Dass nearly rolled
off the platform and howled aloud

But I am Brahmin Sahiba highcaste Brahmin By your soul by your
fathers soul do not make me do this thing

Brahmin or no Brahmin by my soul and my fathers soul in you go
I said and seizing him by the shoulders I crammed his head into
the mouth of the burrow kicked the rest of him in and sitting down
covered my face with my hands

At the end of a few minutes I heard a rustle and a creak then Gunga
Dass in a sobbing choking whisper speaking to himself then a soft
thudand I uncovered my eyes

The dry sand had turned the corpse entrusted to its keeping into a
yellowbrown mummy I told Gunga Dass to stand off while I examined it

The bodyclad in an olivegreen huntingsuit much stained and worn
with leather pads on the shoulderswas that of a man between thirty and
forty above middle height with light sandy hair long mustache and a
rough unkempt beard The left canine of the upper jaw was missing and
a portion of the lobe of the right ear was gone On the second finger of
the left hand was a ringa shieldshaped bloodstone set in gold with
a monogram that might have been either BK or BL On the third
finger of the right hand was a silver ring in the shape of a coiled
cobra much worn and tarnished Gunga Dass deposited a handful of
trifles he had picked out of the burrow at my feet and covering the
face of the body with my handkerchief I turned to examine these I give
the full list in the hope that it may lead to the identification of the
unfortunate man

1 Bowl of a briarwood pipe serrated at the edge much worn and
blackened bound with string at the crew

2 Two patentlever keys wards of both broken

3 Tortoiseshellhandled penknife silver or nickel nameplate marked
with monogram BK

4 Envelope postmark Undecipherable bearing a Victorian stamp
addressed to Miss Mon rest illegible hamnt

5 Imitation crocodileskin notebook with pencil First fortyfive pages
blank four and a half illegible fifteen others filled with private
memoranda relating chiefly to three personsa Mrs L Singleton
abbreviated several times to Lot Single Mrs S May and
Garmison referred to in places as Jerry or Jack

6 Handle of smallsized huntingknife Blade snapped short Bucks horn
diamond cut with swivel and ring on the butt fragment of cotton cord
attached

It must not be supposed that I inventoried all these things on the spot
as fully as I have here written them down The notebook first attracted
my attention and I put it in my pocket with a view of studying it later
on

The rest of the articles I conveyed to my burrow for safetys sake and
there being a methodical man I inventoried them I then returned to
the corpse and ordered Gunga Dass to help me to carry it out to the
riverfront While we were engaged in this the exploded shell of an old
brown cartridge dropped out of one of the pockets and rolled at my feet
Gunga Dass had not seen it and I fell to thinking that a man does not
carry exploded cartridgecases especially browns which will not
bear loading twice about with him when shooting In other words that
cartridgecase had been fired inside the crater Consequently there must
be a gun somewhere I was on the verge of asking Gunga Dass but checked
myself knowing that he would lie We laid the body down on the edge of
the quicksand by the tussocks It was my intention to push it out and
let it be swallowed upthe only possible mode of burial that I could
think of I ordered Gunga Dass to go away

Then I gingerly put the corpse out on the quicksand In doing soit
was lying face downwardI tore the frail and rotten khaki shootingcoat
open disclosing a hideous cavity in the back I have already told you
that the dry sand had as it were mummified the body A moments glance
showed that the gaping hole had been caused by a gunshot wound the
gun must have been fired with the muzzle almost touching the back The
shootingcoat being intact had been drawn over the body after death
which must have been instantaneous The secret of the poor wretchs
death was plain to me in a flash Some one of the crater presumably
Gunga Dass must have shot him with his own gunthe gun that fitted the
brown cartridges He had never attempted to escape in the face of the
riflefire from the boat

I pushed the corpse out hastily and saw it sink from sight literally in
a few seconds I shuddered as I watched In a dazed halfconscious way
I turned to peruse the notebook A stained and discolored slip of paper
bad been inserted between the binding and the back and dropped out as I
opened the pages This is what it containedFour out from crowclump
three left nine out two right three back two left fourteen out two
left seven out one left nine back two right six back four right
seven back The paper had been burned and charred at the edges What it
meant I could not understand I sat down on the dried bents turning
it over and over between my fingers until I was aware of Gunga Dass
standing immediately behind me with glowing eyes and outstretched hands

Have you got it he panted Will you not let me look at it also I
swear that I will return it

Got what Return what asked

That which you have in your hands It will help us both He stretched
out his long birdlike talons trembling with eagerness

I could never find it he continued He had secreted it about his
person Therefore I shot him but nevertheless I was unable to obtain
it

Gunga Dass had quite forgotten his little fiction about the
riflebullet I received the information perfectly calmly Morality is
blunted by consorting with the Dead who are alive

What on earth are you raving about What is it you want me to give
you

The piece of paper in the notebook It will help us both Oh you fool
You fool Can you not see what it will do for us We shall escape

His voice rose almost to a scream and he danced with excitement before
me I own I was moved at the chance of my getting away

Dont skip Explain yourself Do you mean to say that this slip of
paper will help us What does it mean

Read it aloud Read it aloud I beg and I pray you to read it aloud

I did so Gunga Dass listened delightedly and drew an irregular line in
the sand with his fingers

See now It was the length of his gunbarrels without the stock I have
those barrels Four gunbarrels out from the place where I caught crows
straight out do you follow me Then three leftAh how well I remember
when that man worked it out night after night Then nine out and so on
Out is always straight before you across the quicksand He told me so
before I killed him

But if you knew all this why didnt you get out before

I did not know it He told me that he was working it out a year and a
half ago and how he was working it out night after night when the boat
had gone away and he could get out near the quicksand safely Then he
said that we would get away together But I was afraid that he would
leave me behind one night when he had worked it all out and so I shot
him Besides it is not advisable that the men who once get in here
should escape Only I and I am a Brahmin

The prospect of escape had brought Gunga Dasss caste back to him He
stood up walked about and gesticulated violently Eventually I managed
to make him talk soberly and he told me how this Englishman had spent
six months night after night in exploring inch by inch the passage
across the quicksand how he had declared it to be simplicity itself up
to within about twenty yards of the river bank after turning the flank
of the left horn of the horseshoe This much he had evidently not
completed when Gunga Dass shot him with his own gun

In my frenzy of delight at the possibilities of escape I recollect
shaking hands effusively with Gunga Dass after we had decided that we
were to make an attempt to get away that very night It was weary work
waiting throughout the afternoon

About ten oclock as far as I could judge when the Moon had just risen
above the lip of the crater Gunga Dass made a move for his burrow to
bring out the gunbarrels whereby to measure our path All the other
wretched inhabitants had retired to their lairs long ago The guardian
boat drifted downstream some hours before and we were utterly alone by
the crowclump Gunga Dass while carrying the gunbarrels let slip
the piece of paper which was to be our guide I stooped down hastily to
recover it and as I did so I was aware that the diabolical Brahmin
was aiming a violent blow at the back of my head with the gunbarrels
It was too late to turn round I must have received the blow somewhere
on the nape of my neck A hundred thousand fiery stars danced before my
eyes and I fell forwards senseless at the edge of the quicksand

When I recovered consciousness the Moon was going down and I was
sensible of intolerable pain in the back of my head Gunga Dass had
disappeared and my mouth was full of blood I lay down again and prayed
that I might die without more ado Then the unreasoning fury which I had
before mentioned laid hold upon me and I staggered inland toward the
walls of the crater It seemed that some one was calling to me in a
whisperSahib Sahib Sahib exactly as my bearer used to call me in
the morning I fancied that I was delirious until a handful of sand
fell at my feet Then I looked up and saw a head peering down into
the amphitheatrethe head of Dunnoo my dogboy who attended to my
collies As soon as he had attracted my attention he held up his hand
and showed a rope I motioned staggering to and fro for the while that
he should throw it down It was a couple of leather punkahropes knotted
together with a loop at one end I slipped the loop over my head and
under my arms heard Dunnoo urge something forward was conscious that I
was being dragged face downward up the steep sand slope and the
next instant found myself choked and half fainting on the sand
hills overlooking the crater Dunnoo with his face ashy grey in the
moonlight implored me not to stay but to get back to my tent at once

It seems that he had tracked Pornics footprints fourteen miles across
the sands to the crater had returned and told my servants who flatly
refused to meddle with any one white or black once fallen into the
hideous Village of the Dead whereupon Dunnoo had taken one of my ponies
and a couple of punkahropes returned to the crater and hauled me out
as I have described

To cut a long story short Dunnoo is now my personal servant on a gold
mohur a montha sum which I still think far too little for the services
he has rendered Nothing on earth will induce me to go near that
devilish spot again or to reveal its whereabouts more clearly than I
have done Of Gunga Dass I have never found a trace nor do I wish to
do My sole motive in giving this to be published is the hope that some
one may possibly identify from the details and the inventory which I
have given above the corpse of the man in the olivegreen huntingsuit

     




THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING

 Brother to a Prince and fellow to a beggar if he be found worthy

The Law as quoted lays down a fair conduct of life and one not easy to
follow I have been fellow to a beggar again and again under
circumstances which prevented either of us finding out whether the other
was worthy I have still to be brother to a Prince though I once came
near to kinship with what might have been a veritable King and was
promised the reversion of a Kingdomarmy lawcourts revenue and
policy all complete But today I greatly fear that my King is dead
and if I want a crown I must go hunt it for myself

The beginning of everything was in a railwaytrain upon the road to Mhow
from Ajmir There had been a Deficit in the Budget which necessitated
travelling not Secondclass which is only half as dear as FirstClass
but by Intermediate which is very awful indeed There are no cushions
in the Intermediate class and the population are either Intermediate
which is Eurasian or native which for a long night journey is nasty
or Loafer which is amusing though intoxicated Intermediates do not buy
from refreshmentrooms They carry their food in bundles and pots and
buy sweets from the native sweetmeatsellers and drink the roadside
water This is why in hot weather Intermediates are taken out of the
carriages dead and in all weathers are most properly looked down upon

My particular Intermediate happened to be empty till I reached
Nasirabad when the big blackbrowed gentleman in shirtsleeves entered
and following the custom of Intermediates passed the time of day He
was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself but with an educated
taste for whisky He told tales of things he had seen and done of
outoftheway corners of the Empire into which he had penetrated and
of adventures in which he risked his life for a few days food

If India was filled with men like you and me not knowing more than
the crows where theyd get their next days rations it isnt seventy
millions of revenue the land would be payingits seven hundred
millions said he and as I looked at his mouth and chin I was disposed
to agree with him

We talked politicsthe politics of Loaferdom that sees things from
the under side where the lath and plaster is not smoothed offand we
talked postal arrangements because my friend wanted to send a telegram
back from the next station to Ajmir the turningoff place from the
Bombay to the Mhow line as you travel westward My friend had no money
beyond eight annas which he wanted for dinner and I had no money at
all owing to the hitch in the Budget before mentioned Further I was
going into a wilderness where though I should resume touch with the
Treasury there were no telegraph offices I was therefore unable to
help him in any way

We might threaten a Stationmaster and make him send a wire on tick
said my friend but thatd mean inquiries for you and for me and Ive
got my hands full these days Did you say you were travelling back along
this line within any days

Within ten I said

Cant you make it eight said he Mine is rather urgent business

I can send your telegrams within ten days if that will serve you I
said

I couldnt trust the wire to fetch him now I think of it Its this
way He leaves Delhi on the 23rd for Bombay That means hell be running
through Ajmir about the night of the 23rd

But Im going into the Indian Desert I explained

Well and good said he Youll be changing at Marwar Junction to get
into Jodhpore territoryyou must do thatand hell be coming through
Marwar Junction in the early morning of the 24th by the Bombay Mail Can
you be at Marwar Junction on that time T wont be inconveniencing you
because I know that theres precious few pickings to be got out of these
Central India Stateseven though you pretend to be correspondent of the
Backwoodsman

Have you ever tried that trick I asked

Again and again but the Residents find you out and then you get
escorted to the Border before youve time to get your knife into them
But about my friend here I must give him a word o mouth to tell him
whats come to me or else he wont know where to go I would take it
more than kind of you if you was to come out of Central India in time to
catch him at Marwar Junction and say to him He has gone South for the
week Hell know what that means Hes a big man with a red beard and
a great swell he is

Youll find him sleeping like a gentleman with all his luggage round him
in a Secondclass apartment But dont you be afraid

Slip down the window and say He has gone South for the week and
hell tumble Its only cutting your time of stay in those parts by
two days I ask you as a strangergoing to the West he said with
emphasis

Where have you come from said I

From the East said he and I am hoping that you will give him the
message on the squarefor the sake of my Mother as well as your own

Englishmen are not usually softened by appeals to the memory of their
mothers but for certain reasons which will be fully apparent I saw
fit to agree

Its more than a little matter said he and thats why I asked
you to do itand now I know that I can depend on you doing it A
Secondclass carriage at Marwar Junction and a redhaired man asleep
in it Youll be sure to remember I get out at the next station and I
must hold on there till he comes or sends me what I want

Ill give the message if I catch him I said and for the sake of
your Mother as well as mine Ill give you a word of advice Dont try
to run the Central India States just now as the correspondent of the
Backwoodsman Theres a real one knocking about here and it might
lead to trouble

Thank you said he simply and when will the swine be gone I
cant starve because hes ruining my work I wanted to get hold of the
Degumber Rajah down here about his fathers widow and give him a jump

What did he do to his fathers widow then

Filled her up with red pepper and slippered her to death as she hung
from a beam I found that out myself and Im the only man that would
dare going into the State to get hushmoney for it Theyll try to
poison me same as they did in Chortumna when I went on the loot there
But youll give the man at Marwar Junction my message

He got out at a little roadside station and I reflected I had heard
more than once of men personating correspondents of newspapers and
bleeding small Native States with threats of exposure but I had never
met any of the caste before They lead a hard life and generally die
with great suddenness The Native States have a wholesome horror of
English newspapers which may throw light on their peculiar methods of
government and do their best to choke correspondents with champagne
or drive them out of their mind with fourinhand barouches They do not
understand that nobody cares a straw for the internal administration
of Native States so long as oppression and crime are kept within decent
limits and the ruler is not drugged drunk or diseased from one end
of the year to the other They are the dark places of the earth full
of unimaginable cruelty touching the Railway and the Telegraph on one
side and on the other the days of HarunalRaschid When I left the
train I did business with divers Kings and in eight days passed through
many changes of life Sometimes I wore dressclothes and consorted with
Princes and Politicals drinking from crystal and eating from silver
Sometimes I lay out upon the ground and devoured what I could get from
a plate made of leaves and drank the running water and slept under the
same rug as my servant It was all in the days work

Then I headed for the Great Indian Desert upon the proper date as I
had promised and the night Mail set me down at Marwar Junction where
a funny little happygolucky native managed railway runs to Jodhpore
The Bombay Mail from Delhi makes a short halt at Marwar She arrived
just as I got in and I had just time to hurry to her platform and go
down the carriages There was only one Secondclass on the train
I slipped the window and looked down upon a flamingred beard half
covered by a railwayrug That was my man fast asleep and I dug him
gently in the ribs

He woke with a grunt and I saw his face in the light of the lamps

It was a great and shining face

Tickets again said he

No said I I am to tell you that he is gone South for the week He
has gone South for the week

The train had begun to move out The red man rubbed his eyes

He has gone South for the week he repeated Now thats just like his
impidence Did he say that I was to give you anything Cause I wont

He didnt I said and dropped away and watched the red lights die
out in the dark It was horribly cold because the wind was blowing off
the sands I climbed into my own trainnot an Intermediate carriage
this timeand went to sleep

If the man with the beard had given me a rupee I should have kept it as
a memento of a rather curious affair But the consciousness of having
done my duty was my only reward

Later on I reflected that two gentlemen like my friends could not do any
good if they foregathered and personated correspondents of newspapers
and might if they blackmailed one of the little rattrap States
of Central India or Southern Rajputana get themselves into serious
difficulties I therefore took some trouble to describe them as
accurately as I could remember to people who would be interested in
deporting them and succeeded so I was later informed in having them
headed back from the Degumber borders

Then I became respectable and returned to an office where there were no
Kings and no incidents outside the daily manufacture of a newspaper A
newspaper office seems to attract every conceivable sort of person to
the prejudice of discipline Zenanamission ladies arrive and beg that
the Editor will instantly abandon all his duties to describe a Christian
prizegiving in a back slum of a perfectly inaccessible village
Colonels who have been overpassed for command sit down and sketch the
outline of a series of ten twelve or twentyfour leading articles on
Seniority versus Selection missionaries wish to know why they have not
been permitted to escape from their regular vehicles of abuse and swear
at a brother missionary under special patronage of the editorial We
Stranded theatrical companies troop up to explain that they cannot pay
for their advertisements but on their return from New Zealand or Tahiti
will do so with interest inventors of patent punkapulling machines
carriage couplings and unbreakable swords and axletrees call with
specifications in their pockets and hours at their disposal tea
companies enter and elaborate their prospectuses with the office pens
secretaries of ball committees clamour to have the glories of their last
dance more fully described strange ladies rustle in and say I want a
hundred ladys cards printed at once please which is manifestly part
of an Editors duty and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramped
the Grand Trunk Road makes it his business to ask for employment as a
proofreader And all the time the telephonebell is ringing madly
and Kings are being killed on the Continent and Empires are saying
Youre another and Mister Gladstone is calling down brimstone upon
the British Dominions and the little black copyboys are whining
kaapi chayhayeh Copy wanted like tired bees and most of the
paper is as blank as Modreds shield

But that is the amusing part of the year There are six other months
when none ever come to call and the thermometer walks inch by inch
up to the top of the glass and the office is darkened to just above
readinglight and the pressmachines are redhot to touch and nobody
writes anything but accounts of amusements in the Hillstations or
obituary notices Then the telephone becomes a tinkling terror because
it tells you of the sudden deaths of men and women that you knew
intimately and the prickly heat covers you with a garment and you
sit down and write A slight increase of sickness is reported from
the Khuda Janta Khan District The outbreak is purely sporadic in
its nature and thanks to the energetic efforts of the District
authorities is now almost at an end It is however with deep regret
we record the death etc

Then the sickness really breaks out and the less recording and
reporting the better for the peace of the subscribers But the Empires
and the Kings continue to divert themselves as selfishly as before and
the Foreman thinks that a daily paper really ought to come out once in
twentyfour hours and all the people at the Hillstations in the
middle of their amusements say Good gracious why cant the paper be
sparkling Im sure theres plenty going on up here

That is the dark half of the moon and as the advertisements say must
be experienced to be appreciated

It was in that season and a remarkably evil season that the paper
began running the last issue of the week on Saturday night which is to
say Sunday morning after the custom of a London paper This was a great
convenience for immediately after the paper was put to bed the dawn
would lower the thermometer from 96 degrees to almost 84 degrees for
half an hour and in that chillyou have no idea how cold is 84 degrees
on the grass until you begin to pray for ita very tired man could get
off to sleep ere the heat roused him

One Saturday night it was my pleasant duty to put the paper to bed
alone A King or courtier or a courtesan or a Community was going to
die or get a new Constitution or do something that was important on
the other side of the world and the paper was to be held open till the
latest possible minute in order to catch the telegram

It was a pitchyblack night as stifling as a June night can be and
the loo the redhot wind from the westward was booming among the
tinderdry trees and pretending that the rain was on its heels

Now and again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with
the flop of a frog but all our weary world knew that was only pretence
It was a shade cooler in the pressroom than the office so I sat there
while the type ticked and clicked and the nightjars hooted at the
windows and the all but naked compositors wiped the sweat from their
foreheads and called for water The thing that was keeping us back
whatever it was would not come off though the loo dropped and the last
type was set and the whole round earth stood still in the choking heat
with its finger on its lip to wait the event I drowsed and wondered
whether the telegraph was a blessing and whether this dying man or
struggling people might be aware of the inconvenience the delay was
causing There was no special reason beyond the heat and worry to make
tension but as the clockhands crept up to three oclock and the
machines spun their flywheels two and three times to see that all was
in order before I said the word that would set them off I could have
shrieked aloud

Then the roar and rattle of the wheels shivered the quiet into little
bits I rose to go away but two men in white clothes stood in front
of me The first one said Its him The second said So it is And
they both laughed almost as loudly as the machinery roared and mopped
their foreheads We seed there was a light burning across the road
and we were sleeping in that ditch there for coolness and I said to my
friend here The office is open Lets come along and speak to him as
turned us back from Degumber State said the smaller of the two He was
the man I had met in the Mhow train and his fellow was the redbearded
man of Marwar Junction There was no mistaking the eyebrows of the one
or the beard of the other

I was not pleased because I wished to go to sleep not to squabble with
loafers What do you want I asked

Half an hours talk with you cool and comfortable in the office
said the redbearded man Wed like some drinkthe Contrack doesnt
begin yet Peachey so you neednt lookbut what we really want is
advice We dont want money We ask you as a favour because we found
out you did us a bad turn about Degumber State

I led from the pressroom to the stifling office with the maps on the
walls and the redhaired man rubbed his hands Thats something like
said he This was the proper shop to come to

Now Sir let me introduce you to Brother Peachey Carnehan thats
him and Brother Daniel Dravot that is me and the less said about
our professions the better for we have been most things in our
timesoldier sailor compositor photographer proofreader
streetpreacher and correspondents of the Backwoodsman when we
thought the paper wanted one Carnehan is sober and so am I Look at us
first and see thats sure It will save you cutting into my talk Well
take one of your cigars apiece and you shall see us light up

I watched the test The men were absolutely sober so I gave them each a
tepid whiskyandsoda

Well and good said Carnehan of the eyebrows wiping the froth from
his moustache Let me talk now Dan We have been all over India
mostly on foot We have been boilerfitters enginedrivers petty
contractors and all that and we have decided that India isnt big
enough for such as us

They certainly were too big for the office Dravots beard seemed to
fill half the room and Carnehans shoulders the other half as they sat
on the big table Carnehan continued The country isnt half worked
out because they that governs it wont let you touch it They spend all
their blessed time in governing it and you cant lift a spade nor
chip a rock nor look for oil nor anything like that without all the
Government saying Leave it alone and let us govern Therefore such
as it is we will let it alone and go away to some other place where
a man isnt crowded and can come to his own We are not little men and
there is nothing that we are afraid of except Drink and we have signed
a Contrack on that

Therefore we are going away to be Kings

Kings in our own right muttered Dravot

Yes of course I said Youve been tramping in the sun and its
a very warm night and hadnt you better sleep over the notion Come
tomorrow

Neither drunk nor sunstruck said Dravot We have slept over the
notion half a year and require to see Books and Atlases and we have
decided that there is only one place now in the world that two strong
men can Sarawhack They call it Kafiristan By my reckoning its the
top righthand corner of Afghanistan not more than three hundred miles
from Peshawar They have two and thirty heathen idols there and well
be the thirtythird and fourth Its a mountaineous country the women
of those parts are very beautiful

But that is provided against in the Contrack said Carnehan Neither
Women nor Liquor Daniel

And thats all we know except that no one has gone there and they
fight and in any place where they fight a man who knows how to drill
men can always be a King We shall go to those parts and say to any King
we find D you want to vanquish your foes and we will show him how
to drill men for that we know better than anything else Then we will
subvert that King and seize his Throne and establish a Dynasty

Youll be cut to pieces before youre fifty miles across the Border
I said You have to travel through Afghanistan to get to that country
Its one mass of mountains and peaks and glaciers and no Englishman has
been through it The people are utter brutes and even if you reached
them you couldnt do anything

Thats more like said Carnehan If you could think us a little more
mad we would be more pleased We have come to you to know about this
country to read a book about it and to be shown maps We want you to
tell us that we are fools and to show us your books He turned to the
bookcases

Are you at all in earnest I said

A little said Dravot sweetly As big a map as you have got even
if its all blank where Kafiristan is and any books youve got We can
read though we arent very educated

I uncased the big thirtytwomilestotheinch map of India and two
smaller Frontier maps hauled down volume INFKAN of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica and the men consulted them

See here said Dravot his thumb on the map Up to Jagdallak Peachey
and me know the road We was there with Roberts Army Well have to
turn off to the right at Jagdallak through Laghmann territory Then we
get among the hillsfourteen thousand feetfifteen thousandit will
be cold work there but it dont look very far on the map

I handed him Wood on the Sources of the Oxus Carnehan was deep in the
Encyclopaedia

Theyre a mixed lot said Dravot reflectively and it wont help
us to know the names of their tribes The more tribes the more theyll
fight and the better for us From Jagdallak to Ashang Hmm

But all the information about the country is as sketchy and inaccurate
as can be I protested No one knows anything about it really Heres
the file of the United Services Institute Read what Bellew says

Blow Bellew said Carnehan Dan theyre a stinkin lot of heathens
but this book here says they think theyre related to us English

I smoked while the men poured over Raverty Wood the maps and the
Encyclopaedia

There is no use your waiting said Dravot politely Its about four
oclock now Well go before six oclock if you want to sleep and we
wont steal any of the papers Dont you sit up Were two harmless
lunatics and if you come tomorrow evening down to the Serai well say
goodbye to you

You are two fools I answered Youll be turned back at the Frontier
or cut up the minute you set foot in Afghanistan Do you want any money
or a recommendation downcountry I can help you to the chance of work
next week

Next week we shall be hard at work ourselves thank you said Dravot
It isnt so easy being a King as it looks When weve got our Kingdom
in going order well let you know and you can come up and help us
govern it

Would two lunatics make a Contrack like that said Carnehan with
subdued pride showing me a greasy halfsheet of notepaper on which was
written the following I copied it then and there as a curiosity

This Contrack between me and you persuing witnesseth in the name of
GodAmen and so forth

One That me and you will settle this matter together ie to be
Kings of Kafiristan

TwoThat you and me will not while this matter is being settled look
at any Liquor nor any Woman black white or brown so as to get mixed
up with one or the other harmful

Three That we conduct ourselves with Dignity and Discretion and if
one of us gets into trouble the other will stay by him

Signed by you and me this day

Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan

Daniel Dravot

Both Gentlemen at Large


There was no need for the last article said Carnehan blushing
modestly but it looks regular Now you know the sort of men that
loafers arewe are loafers Dan until we get out of Indiaand
do you think that we would sign a Contrack like that unless we was in
earnest We have kept away from the two things that make life worth
having

You wont enjoy your lives much longer if you are going to try this
idiotic adventure Dont set the office on fire I said and go away
before nine oclock

I left them still poring over the maps and making notes on the back of
the Contrack Be sure to come down to the Serai tomorrow were their
parting words

The Kumharsen Serai is the great foursquare sink of humanity where the
strings of camels and horses from the North load and unload All the
nationalities of Central Asia may be found there and most of the folk
of India proper Balkh and Bokhara there meet Bengal and Bombay and try
to draw eyeteeth You can buy ponies turquoises Persian pussycats
saddlebags fattailed sheep and musk in the Kumharsen Serai and get
many strange things for nothing In the afternoon I went down to see
whether my friends intended to keep their word or were lying there
drunk

A priest attired in fragments of ribbons and rags stalked up to me
gravely twisting a childs paper whirligig Behind him was his servant
bending under the load of a crate of mud toys The two were loading up
two camels and the inhabitants of the Serai watched them with shrieks
of laughter

The priest is mad said a horsedealer to me He is going up to Kabul
to sell toys to the Amir He will either be raised to honour or have his
head cut off He came in here this morning and has been behaving madly
ever since

The witless are under the protection of God stammered a flatcheeked
Usbeg in broken Hindi They foretell future events

Would they could have foretold that my caravan would have been cut up
by the Shinwaris almost within shadow of the Pass grunted the Eusufzai
agent of a Rajputana tradinghouse whose goods had been diverted into
the hands of other robbers just across the Border and whose misfortunes
were the laughingstock of the bazaar Ohe priest whence come you
and whither do you go

From Roum have I come shouted the priest waving his whirligig from
Roum blown by the breath of a hundred devils across the sea O thieves
robbers liars the blessing of Pir Khan on pigs dogs and perjurers
Who will take the Protected of God to the North to sell charms that are
never still to the Amir The camels shall not gall the sons shall not
fall sick and the wives shall remain faithful while they are away
of the men who give me place in their caravan Who will assist me to
slipper the King of the Roos with a golden slipper with a silver heel
The protection of Pir Khan be upon his labours He spread out the
skirts of his gabardine and pirouetted between the lines of tethered
horses

There starts a caravan from Peshawar to Kabul in twenty days Huzrut
said the Eusufzai trader My camels go therewith Do thou also go and
bring us good luck

I will go even now shouted the priest I will depart upon my winged
camels and be at Peshawar in a day Ho Hazar Mir Khan he yelled to
his servant drive out the camels but let me first mount my own

He leaped on the back of his beast as it knelt and turning round to
me cried Come thou also Sahib a little along the road and I will
sell thee a charman amulet that shall make thee King of Kafiristan

Then the light broke upon me and I followed the two camels out of the
Serai till we reached open road and the priest halted

What d you think o that said he in English Carnehan cant talk
their patter so Ive made him my servant He makes a handsome servant
T isnt for nothing that Ive been knocking about the country for
fourteen years Didnt I do that talk neat Well hitch on to a caravan
at Peshawar till we get to Jagdallak and then well see if we can get
donkeys for our camels and strike into Kafiristan Whirligigs for the
Amir O Lor Put your hand under the camelbags and tell me what you
feel

I felt the butt of a Martini and another and another

Twenty of em said Dravot placidly Twenty of em and ammunition to
correspond under the whirligigs and the mud dolls

Heaven help you if you are caught with those things I said A
Martini is worth her weight in silver among the Pathans

Fifteen hundred rupees of capitalevery rupee we could beg borrow or
stealare invested on these two camels said Dravot

We wont get caught Were going through the Khaiber with a regular
caravan Whod touch a poor mad priest

Have you got everything you want I asked overcome with astonishment

Not yet but we shall soon Give us a memento of your kindness
Brother You did me a service yesterday and that time in Marwar Half
my Kingdom shall you have as the saying is I slipped a small charm
compass from my watchchain and handed it up to the priest

Goodbye said Dravot giving me hand cautiously Its the last time
well shake hands with an Englishman these many days Shake hands with
him Carnehan he cried as the second camel passed me

Carnehan leaned down and shook hands Then the camels passed away along
the dusty road and I was left alone to wonder My eye could detect no
failure in the disguises The scene in the Serai proved that they were
complete to the native mind There was just the chance therefore that
Carnehan and Dravot would be able to wander through Afghanistan without
detection But beyond they would find deathcertain and awful death

Ten days later a native correspondent giving me the news of the day
from Peshawar wound up his letter with There has been much laughter
here on account of a certain mad priest who is going in his estimation
to sell petty gauds and insignificant trinkets which he ascribes as
great charms to H H the Amir of Bokhara He passed through Peshawar
and associated himself to the Second Summer caravan that goes to Kabul
The merchants are pleased because through superstition they imagine that
such mad fellows bring good fortune

The two then were beyond the Border I would have prayed for them but
that night a real King died in Europe and demanded an obituary notice

The wheel of the world swings through the same phases again and again
Summer passed and winter thereafter and came and passed again The
daily paper continued and I with it and upon the third summer there
fell a hot night a night issue and a strained waiting for something to
be telegraphed from the other side of the world exactly as had happened
before A few great men had died in the past two years the machines
worked with more clatter and some of the trees in the office garden
were a few feet taller But that was all the difference

I passed over to the pressroom and went through just such a scene as
I have already described The nervous tension was stronger than it
had been two years before and I felt the heat more acutely At three
oclock I cried Print off and turned to go when there crept to my
chair what was left of a man He was bent into a circle his head was
sunk between his shoulders and he moved his feet one over the other
like a bear I could hardly see whether he walked or crawledthis
ragwrapped whining cripple who addressed me by name crying that he
was come back Can you give me a drink he whimpered For the Lords
sake give me a drink

I went back to the office the man following with groans of pain and I
turned up the lamp

Dont you know me he gasped dropping into a chair and he turned his
drawn face surmounted by a shock of gray hair to the light

I looked at him intently Once before had I seen eyebrows that met over
the nose in an inchbroad black band but for the life of me I could not
tell where

I dont know you I said handing him the whisky What can I do for
you

He took a gulp of the spirit raw and shivered in spite of the
suffocating heat

Ive come back he repeated and I was the King of Kafiristanme and
Dravotcrowned Kings we was In this office we settled ityou setting
there and giving us the books I am PeacheyPeachey Taliaferro
Carnehanand youve been setting here ever sinceO Lord

I was more than a little astonished and expressed my feelings
accordingly

Its true said Carnehan with a dry cackle nursing his feet which
were wrapped in ragstrue as gospel Kings we were with crowns upon
our headsme and Dravotpoor Danoh poor poor Dan that would never
take advice not though I begged of him

Take the whisky I said and take your own time Tell me all you can
recollect of everything from beginning to end You got across the Border
on your camels Dravot dressed as a mad priest and you his servant Do
you remember that

I aint madyet but I shall be that way soon Of course I remember
Keep looking at me or maybe my words will go all to pieces Keep
looking at me in my eyes and dont say anything

I leaned forward and looked into his face as steadily as I could He
dropped one hand upon the table and I grasped it by the wrist It
was twisted like a birds claw and upon the back was a ragged red
diamondshaped scar

No dont look there Look at me said Carnehan That comes
afterward but for the Lords sake dont distrack me We left with that
caravan me and Dravot playing all sorts of antics to amuse the people
we were with Dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the
people was cooking their dinnerscooking their dinners and
what did they do then They lit little fires with sparks that went into
Dravots beard and we all laughedfit to die Little red fires they
was going into Dravots big red beardso funny His eyes left mine
and he smiled foolishly

You went as far as Jagdallak with that caravan I said at a venture
after you had lit those fires To Jagdallak where you turned off to
try to get into Kafiristan

No we didnt neither What are you talking about We turned off
before Jagdallak because we heard the roads was good But they wasnt
good enough for our two camelsmine and Dravots When we left the
caravan Dravot took off all his clothes and mine too and said we would
be heathen because the Kafirs didnt allow Mohammedans to talk to them
So we dressed betwixt and between and such a sight as Daniel Dravot
I never saw yet nor expect to see again He burned half his beard and
slung a sheepskin over his shoulder and shaved his head into patterns
He shaved mine too and made me wear outrageous things to look like
a heathen That was in a most mountaineous country and our camels
couldnt go along any more because of the mountains They were tall and
black and coming home I saw them fight like wild goatsthere are lots
of goats in Kafiristan And these mountains they never keep still no
more than the goats Always fighting they are and dont let you sleep
at night

Take some more whisky I said very slowly What did you and Daniel
Dravot do when the camels could go no farther because of the rough roads
that led into Kafiristan

What did which do There was a party called Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan
that was with Dravot Shall I tell you about him He died out there in
the cold Slap from the bridge fell old Peachey turning and twisting in
the air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the Amir No they
was two for three hapence those whirligigs or I am much mistaken and
woful sore And then these camels were no use and Peachey said to
Dravot For the Lords sake lets get out of this before our heads
are chopped off and with that they killed the camels all among the
mountains not having anything in particular to eat but first they took
off the boxes with the guns and the ammunition till two men came along
driving four mules Dravot up and dances in front of them singing
Sell me four mules Says the first man If you are rich enough to
buy you are rich enough to rob but before ever he could put his hand
to his knife Dravot breaks his neck over his knee and the other party
runs away So Carnehan loaded the mules with the rifles that was taken
off the camels and together we starts forward into those bittercold
mountaineous parts and never a road broader than the back of your
hand

He paused for a moment while I asked him if he could remember the
nature of the country through which he had journeyed

I am telling you as straight as I can but my head isnt as good as it
might be They drove nails through it to make me hear better how Dravot
died The country was mountaineous and the mules were most contrary
and the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary They went up and up and
down and down and that other party Carnehan was imploring of Dravot
not to sing and whistle so loud for fear of bringing down the tremenjus
avalanches But Dravot says that if a King couldnt sing it wasnt worth
being King and whacked the mules over the rump and never took no
heed for ten cold days We came to a big level valley all among the
mountains and the mules were near dead so we killed them not having
anything in special for them or us to eat We sat upon the boxes and
played odd and even with the cartridges that was jolted out

Then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley chasing twenty
men with bows and arrows and the row was tremenjus

They was fair menfairer than you or mewith yellow hair and
remarkable well built Says Dravot unpacking the guns This is the
beginning of the business Well fight for the ten men and with that
he fires two rifles at the twenty men and drops one of them at two
hundred yards from the rock where he was sitting The other men began to
run but Carnehan and Dravot sits on the boxes picking them off at all
ranges up and down the valley Then we goes up to the ten men that
had run across the snow too and they fires a footy little arrow at us
Dravot he shoots above their heads and they all falls down flat Then
he walks over them and kicks them and then he lifts them up and shakes
hands all round to make them friendly like He calls them and gives them
the boxes to carry and waves his hand for all the world as though he
was King already They takes the boxes and him across the valley and up
the hill into a pine wood on the top where there was half a dozen
big stone idols Dravot he goes to the biggesta fellow they call
Imbraand lays a rifle and a cartridge at his feet rubbing his nose
respectfully with his own nose patting him on the head and nods his
head and says Thats all right Im in the know too and these old
jimjams are my friends Then he opens his mouth and points down it and
when the first man brings him food he says No and when the second
man brings him food he says no but when one of the old priests and
the boss of the village brings him food he says Yes very haughty
and eats it slow That was how he came to our first village without any
trouble just as though we had tumbled from the skies But we tumbled
from one of those damned ropebridges you see andyou couldnt expect
a man to laugh much after that

Take some more whisky and go on I said That was the first village
you came into How did you get to be King

I wasnt King said Carnehan Dravot he was the King and a handsome
man he looked with the gold crown on his head and all Him and the other
party stayed in that village and every morning Dravot sat by the side
of old Imbra and the people came and worshipped That was Dravots
order Then a lot of men came into the valley and Carnehan Dravot picks
them off with the rifles before they knew where they was and runs down
into the valley and up again the other side and finds another village
same as the first one and the people all falls down flat on their
faces and Dravot says Now what is the trouble between you two
villages and the people points to a woman as fair as you or me that
was carried off and Dravot takes her back to the first village and
counts up the deadeight there was For each dead man Dravot pours
a little milk on the ground and waves his arms like a whirligig and
Thats all right says he Then he and Carnehan takes the big boss of
each village by the arm and walks them down the valley and shows them
how to scratch a line with a spear right down the valley and gives each
a sod of turf from both sides of the line Then all the people comes
down and shouts like the devil and all and Dravot says Go and dig the
land and be fruitful and multiply which they did though they didnt
understand Then we asks the names of things in their lingobread and
water and fire and idols and such and Dravot leads the priest of each
village up to the idol and says he must sit there and judge the people
and if anything goes wrong he is to be shot

Next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet as
bees and much prettier and the priests heard all the complaints and
told Dravot in dumbshow what it was about Thats just the beginning
says Dravot They think were Gods He and Carnehan picks out twenty
good men and shows them how to click off a rifle and form fours and
advance in line and they was very pleased to do so and clever to see
the hang of it Then he takes out his pipe and his baccypouch and
leaves one at one village and one at the other and off we two goes to
see what was to be done in the next valley That was all rock and there
was a little village there and Carnehan says Send em to the old
valley to plant and takes em there and gives em some land that
wasnt took before They were a poor lot and we blooded em with a kid
before letting em into the new Kingdom That was to impress the people
and then they settled down quiet and Carnehan went back to Dravot who
had got into another valley all snow and ice and most mountaineous

There was no people there and the Army got afraid so Dravot shoots
one of them and goes on till he finds some people in a village and the
Army explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better
not shoot their little matchlocks for they had matchlocks We makes
friends with the priest and I stays there alone with two of the Army
teaching the men how to drill and a thundering big Chief comes across
the snow with kettledrums and horns twanging because he heard there was
a new God kicking about Carnehan sights for the brown of the men half
a mile across the snow and wings one of them Then he sends a message
to the Chief that unless he wished to be killed he must come and shake
hands with me and leave his arms behind The Chief comes alone first
and Carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his arms about same as
Dravot used and very much surprised that Chief was and strokes
my eyebrows Then Carnehan goes alone to the Chief and asks him in
dumbshow if he had an enemy he hated I have says the chief So
Carnehan weeds out the pick of his men and sets the two of the Army to
show them drill and at the end of two weeks the men can manoeuvre about
as well as Volunteers So he marches with the Chief to a great big plain
on the top of a mountain and the Chiefs men rushes into a village and
takes it we three Martinis firing into the brown of the enemy So we
took that village too and I gives the Chief a rag from my coat and
says Occupy till I come which was scriptural By way of a reminder
when me and the Army was eighteen hundred yards away I drops a bullet
near him standing on the snow and all the people falls flat on their
faces Then I sends a letter to Dravot wherever he be by land or by
sea

At the risk of throwing the creature out of train I interrupted How
could you write a letter up yonder

The letterohthe letter Keep looking at me between the eyes
please It was a stringtalk letter that wed learned the way of it
from a blind beggar in the Punjab

I remember that there had once come to the office a blind man with
a knotted twig and a piece of string which he wound round the twig
according to some cipher of his own He could after the lapse of days
or hours repeat the sentence which he had reeled up

He had reduced the alphabet to eleven primitive sounds and tried to
teach me his method but I could not understand

I sent that letter to Dravot said Carnehan and told him to come
back because this Kingdom was growing too big for me to handle and then
I struck for the first valley to see how the priests were working They
called the village we took along with the Chief Bashkai and the first
village we took ErHeb The priests at ErHeb was doing all right but
they had a lot of pending cases about land to show me and some men from
another village had been firing arrows at night I went out and looked
for that village and fired four rounds at it from a thousand yards
That used all the cartridges I cared to spend and I waited for Dravot
who had been away two or three months and I kept my people quiet

One morning I heard the devils own noise of drums and horns and Dan
Dravot marches down the hill with his Army and a tail of hundreds of
men and which was the most amazing a great gold crown on his head
My Gord Carnehan says Daniel this is a tremenjus business and
weve got the whole country as far as its worth having I am the son
of Alexander by Queen Semiramis and youre my younger brother and a
God too Its the biggest thing weve ever seen Ive been marching and
fighting for six weeks with the Army and every footy little village for
fifty miles has come in rejoiceful and more than that Ive got the key
of the whole show as youll see and Ive got a crown for you I told
em to make two of em at a place called Shu where the gold lies in the
rock like suet in mutton Gold Ive seen and turquoise Ive kicked out
of the cliffs and theres garnets in the sands of the river and heres
a chunk of amber that a man brought me Call up all the priests and
here take your crown

One of the men opens a black hair bag and I slips the crown on It was
too small and too heavy but I wore it for the glory Hammered gold it
wasfive pounds weight like a hoop of a barrel

Peachey says Dravot we dont want to fight no more The Crafts
the trick so help me and he brings forward that same Chief that I
left at BashkaiBilly Fish we called him afterward because he was so
like Billy Fish that drove the big tankengine at Mach on the Bolan in
the old days Shake hands with him says Dravot and I shook hands
and nearly dropped for Billy Fish gave me the Grip I said nothing but
tried him with the Fellowcraft Grip He answers all right and I tried
the Masters Grip but that was a slip A Fellowcraft he is I says
to Dan Does he know the word He does says Dan and all the
priests know Its a miracle The Chiefs and the priests can work a
Fellowcraft Lodge in a way thats very like ours and theyve cut the
marks on the rocks but they dont know the Third Degree and theyve
come to find out Its Gords Truth Ive known these long years that
the Afghans knew up to the Fellowcraft Degree but this is a miracle
A God and a Grand Master of the Craft am I and a Lodge in the Third
Degree I will open and well raise the head priests and the Chiefs of
the villages

Its against all the law I says holding a Lodge without warrant
from any one and you know we never held office in any Lodge

Its a master stroke o policy says Dravot It means running the
country as easy as a fourwheeled bogie on a down grade We cant stop
to inquire now or theyll turn against us Ive forty Chiefs at my
heel and passed and raised according to their merit they shall be
Billet these men on the villages and see that we run up a Lodge of some
kind The temple of Imbra will do for a Lodgeroom The women must make
aprons as you show them Ill hold a levee of Chiefs tonight and Lodge
tomorrow

I was fair run off my legs but I wasnt such a fool as not to see what
a pull this Craft business gave us I showed the priests families how
to make aprons of the degrees but for Dravots apron the blue border
and marks was made of turquoise lumps on white hide not cloth We took
a great square stone in the temple for the Masters chair and little
stones for the officers chairs and painted the black pavement with
white squares and did what we could to make things regular

At the levee which was held that night on the hillside with big
bonfires Dravot gives out that him and me were Gods and sons of
Alexander and Passed Grand Masters in the Craft and was come to make
Kafiristan a country where every man should eat in peace and drink in
quiet and specially obey us Then the Chiefs come round to shake hands
and they were so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with
old friends We gave them names according as they was like men we had
known in IndiaBilly Fish Holly Dilworth Pikky Kergan that was
Bazaarmaster when I was at Mhow and so on and so on

The most amazing miracles was at Lodge next night One of the old priests
was watching us continuous and I felt uneasy for I knew wed have to
fudge the Ritual and I didnt know what the men knew The old priest
was a stranger come in from beyond the village of Bashkai The minute
Dravot puts on the Masters apron that the girls had made for him the
priest fetches a whoop and a howl and tries to overturn the stone
that Dravot was sitting on Its all up now I says That comes of
meddling with the Craft without warrant Dravot never winked an
eye not when ten priests took and tilted over the Grand Masters
chairwhich was to say the stone of Imbra The priest begins rubbing
the bottom end of it to clear away the black dirt and presently he
shows all the other priests the Masters Mark same as was on Dravots
apron cut into the stone Not even the priests of the temple of Imbra
knew it was there The old chap falls flat on his face at Dravots feet
and kisses em Luck again says Dravot across the Lodge to me
they say its the missing Mark that no one could understand the why of

Were more than safe now Then he bangs the butt of his gun for a
gavel and says By virtue of the authority vested in me by my own right
hand and the help of Peachey I declare myself Grand Master of all
Freemasonry in Kafiristan in this the Mother Lodge o the country and
King of Kafiristan equally with Peachey At that he puts on his crown
and I puts on mineI was doing Senior Wardenand we opens the Lodge
in most ample form It was an amazing miracle The priests moved in
Lodge through the first two degrees almost without telling as if the
memory was coming back to them After that Peachey and Dravot raised
such as was worthyhigh priests and Chiefs of faroff villages Billy
Fish was the first and I can tell you we scared the soul out of him It
was not in any way according to Ritual but it served our turn We
didnt raise more than ten of the biggest men because we didnt want to
make the Degree common And they was clamouring to be raised

In another six months says Dravot well hold another Communication
and see how you are working Then he asks them about their villages
and learns that they was fighting one against the other and were sick
and tired of it And when they wasnt doing that they was fighting with
the Mohammedans You can fight those when they come into our country
says Dravot Tell off every tenth man of your tribes for a Frontier
guard and send two hundred at a time to this valley to be drilled
Nobody is going to be shot or speared any more so long as he does well
and I know that you wont cheat me because youre white peoplesons
of Alexanderand not like common black Mohammedans You are my people
and by God says he running off into English at the end Ill make a
damned fine Nation of you or Ill die in the making

I cant tell all we did for the next six months because Dravot did a
lot I couldnt see the hang of and he learned their lingo in a way I
never could My work was to help the people plough and now and again
go out with some of the Army and see what the other villages were doing
and make em throw rope bridges across the ravines which cut up the
country horrid Dravot was very kind to me but when he walked up and
down in the pine wood pulling that bloody red beard of his with both
fists I knew he was thinking plans I could not advise about and I just
waited for orders

But Dravot never showed me disrespect before the people They were
afraid of me and the Army but they loved Dan He was the best of
friends with the priests and the Chiefs but any one could come across
the hills with a complaint and Dravot would hear him out fair and call
four priests together and say what was to be done

He used to call in Billy Fish from Bashkai and Pikky Kergan from Shu
and an old Chief we called Kafuzelumit was like enough to his real
nameand hold councils with em when there was any fighting to be done
in small villages That was his Council of War and the four priests of
Bashkai Shu Khawak and Madora was his Privy Council Between the lot
of em they sent me with forty men and twenty rifles and sixty men
carrying turquoises into the Ghorband country to buy those handmade
Martini rifles that come out of the Amirs workshops at Kabul from one
of the Amirs Herati regiments that would have sold the very teeth out
of their mouths for turquoises

I stayed in Ghorband a month and gave the Governor there the pick of
my baskets for hushmoney and bribed the Colonel of the regiment some
more and between the two and the tribespeople we got more than a
hundred handmade Martinis a hundred good Kohat Jezails thatll throw
to six hundred yards and forty manloads of very bad ammunition for
the rifles I came back with what I had and distributed em among
the men that the Chiefs sent in to me to drill Dravot was too busy to
attend to those things but the old Army that we first made helped me
and we turned out five hundred men that could drill and two hundred
that knew how to hold arms pretty straight Even those corkscrewed
handmade guns was a miracle to them Dravot talked big about
powdershops and factories walking up and down in the pine wood when
the winter was coming on

I wont make a Nation says he Ill make an Empire These men
arent niggers theyre English Look at their eyeslook at their
mouths Look at the way they stand up They sit on chairs in their own
houses Theyre the Lost Tribes or something like it and theyve grown
to be English Ill take a census in the spring if the priests dont get
frightened There must be a fair two million of em in these hills The
villages are full o little children Two million peopletwo hundred
and fifty thousand fighting menand all English They only want the
rifles and a little drilling Two hundred and fifty thousand men ready
to cut in on Russias right flank when she tries for India Peachey
man he says chewing his beard in great hunks we shall be
EmperorsEmperors of the Earth Rajah Brooke will be a suckling to
us Ill treat with the Viceroy on equal terms Ill ask him to send me
twelve picked Englishtwelve that I know ofto help us govern a bit
Theres Mackray Serjeant Pensioner at Segowlimanys the good dinner
hes given me and his wife a pair of trousers Theres Donkin the
Warder of Tounghoo Jail theres hundreds that I could lay my hand on if
I was in India The Viceroy shall do it for me Ill send a man through
in the spring for those men and Ill write for a dispensation from
the Grand Lodge for what Ive done as Grand Master Thatand all the
Sniders thatll be thrown out when the native troops in India take up
the Martini Theyll be worn smooth but theyll do for fighting in
these hills Twelve English a hundred thousand Sniders run through the
Amirs country in dribletsId be content with twenty thousand in one
yearand wed be an Empire

When everything was shipshape Id hand over the crownthis crown Im
wearing nowto Queen Victoria on my knees and shed say Rise up Sir
Daniel Dravot Oh its big Its big I tell you But theres so much
to be done in every placeBashkai Khawak Shu and everywhere else

What is it I says There are no more men coming in to be drilled
this autumn Look at those fat black clouds Theyre bringing the snow

It isnt that says Daniel putting his hand very hard on my
shoulder and I dont wish to say anything thats against you for no
other living man would have followed me and made me what I am as you
have done Youre a firstclass CommanderinChief and the people know
you butits a big country and somehow you cant help me Peachey in
the way I want to be helped

Go to your blasted priests then I said and I was sorry when I made
that remark but it did hurt me sore to find Daniel talking so superior
when Id drilled all the men and done all he told me

Dont lets quarrel Peachey says Daniel without cursing Youre
a King too and the half of this Kingdom is yours but cant you see
Peachey we want cleverer men than us nowthree or four of em that
we can scatter about for our Deputies Its a hugeous great State and
I cant always tell the right thing to do and I havent time for all I
want to do and heres the winter coming on and all

He put half his beard into his mouth all red like the gold of his
crown

Im sorry Daniel says I Ive done all I could Ive drilled
the men and shown the people how to stack their oats better and Ive
brought in those tinware rifles from Ghorbandbut I know what youre
driving at I take it Kings always feel oppressed that way

Theres another thing too says Dravot walking up and down The
winters coming and these people wont be giving much trouble and if
they do we cant move about I want a wife

For Gords sake leave the women alone I says Weve both got all
the work we can though I am a fool Remember the Contrack and keep
clear o women

The Contrack only lasted till such time as we was Kings and Kings
we have been these months past says Dravot weighing his crown in his
hand You go get a wife too Peacheya nice strappin plump girl
thatll keep you warm in the winter Theyre prettier than English
girls and we can take the pick of em Boil em once or twice in hot
water and theyll come out like chicken and ham

Dont tempt me I says I will not have any dealings with a woman
not till we are a dam side more settled than we are now Ive been
doing the work o two men and youve been doing the work of three
Lets lie off a bit and see if we can get some better tobacco from
Afghan country and run in some good liquor and no women

Whos talking o women says Dravot I said wifea Queen to breed
a Kings son for the King A Queen out of the strongest tribe thatll
make them your bloodbrothers and thatll lie by your side and tell
you all the people thinks about you and their own affairs Thats what I
want

Do you remember that Bengali woman I kept at Mogul Serai when I was
a platelayer says I A fat lot o good she was to me She taught me
the lingo and one or two other things but what happened She ran away
with the Stationmasters servant and half my months pay Then
she turned up at Dadur Junction in tow of a halfcaste and had the
impidence to say I was her husbandall among the drivers in the
runningshed too

Weve done with that says Dravot these women are whiter than you
or me and a Queen I will have for the winter months

For the last time o asking Dan do not I says Itll only bring
us harm The Bible says that Kings aint to waste their strength on
women specially when theyve got a new raw Kingdom to work over

For the last time of answering I will said Dravot and he went away
through the pine trees looking like a big red devil the sun being on
his crown and beard and all

But getting a wife was not as easy as Dan thought He put it before the
Council and there was no answer till Billy Fish said that hed better
ask the girls Dravot damned them all round

Whats wrong with me he shouts standing by the idol Imbra Am I
a dog or am I not enough of a man for your wenches Havent I put the
shadow of my hand over this country Who stopped the last Afghan raid
It was me really but Dravot was too angry to remember Who bought your
guns Who repaired the bridges Whos the Grand Master of the sign cut
in the stone says he and he thumped his hand on the block that he
used to sit on in Lodge and at Council which opened like Lodge always
Billy Fish said nothing and no more did the others Keep your hair
on Dan said I and ask the girls Thats how its done at Home and
these people are quite English

The marriage of the King is a matter of State says Dan in a
whitehot rage for he could feel I hope that he was going against
his better mind He walked out of the Councilroom and the others sat
still looking at the ground

Billy Fish says I to the Chief of Bashkai whats the difficulty
here A straight answer to a true friend

You know says Billy Fish How should a man tell you who knows
everything How can daughters of men marry Gods or Devils Its not
proper

I remembered something like that in the Bible but if after seeing us
as long as they had they still believed we were Gods it wasnt for me
to undeceive them

A God can do anything says I If the King is fond of a girl hell
not let her die Shell have to said Billy Fish There are all
sorts of Gods and Devils in these mountains and now and again a girl
marries one of them and isnt seen any more Besides you two know the
Mark cut in the stone Only the Gods know that We thought you were men
till you showed the sign of the Master

I wished then that we had explained about the loss of the genuine
secrets of a Master Mason at the first gooff but I said nothing All
that night there was a blowing of horns in a little dark temple halfway
down the hill and I heard the girl crying fit to die One of the
priests told us that she was being prepared to marry the King

Ill have no nonsense of that kind says Dan I dont want to
interfere with your customs but Ill take my own wife The girls a
little bit afraid says the priest She thinks shes going to die and
they are aheartening of her up down in the temple

Hearten her very tender then says Dravot or Ill hearten you with
the butt of a gun so youll never want to be heartened again

He licked his lips did Dan and stayed up walking about more than half
the night thinking of the wife that he was going to get in the morning
I wasnt any means comfortable for I knew that dealings with a woman
in foreign parts though you was a crowned King twenty times over could
not but be risky I got up very early in the morning while Dravot was
asleep and I saw the priests talking together in whispers and the
Chiefs talking together too and they looked at me out of the corners of
their eyes

What is up Fish I say to the Bashkai man who was wrapped up in his
furs and looking splendid to behold

I cant rightly say says he but if you can make the King drop all
this nonsense about marriage youll be doing him and me and yourself a
great service

That I do believe says I But sure you know Billy as well as me
having fought against and for us that the King and me are nothing more
than two of the finest men that God Almighty ever made Nothing more I
do assure you

That may be says Billy Fish and yet I should be sorry if it was
He sinks his head upon his great fur cloak for a minute and thinks
King says he be you man or God or Devil Ill stick by you today
I have twenty of my men with me and they will follow me Well go to
Bashkai until the storm blows over

A little snow had fallen in the night and everything was white except
the greasy fat clouds that blew down and down from the north Dravot
came out with his crown on his head swinging his arms and stamping his
feet and looking more pleased than Punch

For the last time drop it Dan says I in a whisper Billy Fish
here says that there will be a row

A row among my people says Dravot Not much Peachey youre a fool
not to get a wife too Wheres the girl says he with a voice as loud
as the braying of a jackass Call up all the Chiefs and priests and
let the Emperor see if his wife suits him

There was no need to call any one They were all there leaning on their
guns and spears round the clearing in the centre of the pine wood A lot
of priests went down to the little temple to bring up the girl and the
horns blew fit to wake the dead Billy Fish saunters round and gets as
close to Daniel as he could and behind him stood his twenty men with
matchlocksnot a man of them under six feet I was next to Dravot and
behind me was twenty men of the regular Army Up comes the girl and a
strapping wench she was covered with silver and turquoises but white
as death and looking back every minute at the priests

Shell do said Dan looking her over Whats to be afraid of lass
Come and kiss me He puts his arm round her She shuts her eyes
gives a bit of a squeak and down goes her face in the side of Dans
flamingred beard

The sluts bitten me says he clapping his hand to his neck and
sure enough his hand was red with blood Billy Fish and two of his
matchlock men catches hold of Dan by the shoulders and drags him into
the Bashkai lot while the priests howls in their lingo Neither God
nor Devil but a man I was all taken aback for a priest cut at me in
front and the Army behind began firing into the Bashkai men

God Amighty says Dan what is the meaning o this

Come back Come away says Billy Fish Ruin and Mutiny is the
matter Well break for Bashkai if we can

I tried to give some sort of orders to my menthe men o the regular
Armybut it was no use so I fired into the brown of em with an
English Martini and drilled three beggars in a line The valley was full
of shouting howling creatures and every soul was shrieking Not a God
nor a Devil but only a man The Bashkai troops stuck to Billy Fish all
they were worth but their matchlocks wasnt half as good as the Kabul
breechloaders and four of them dropped Dan was bellowing like a bull
for he was very wrathy and Billy Fish had a hard job to prevent him
running out at the crowd

We cant stand says Billy Fish Make a run for it down the valley
The whole place is against us The matchlockmen ran and we went down
the valley in spite of Dravot He was swearing horrible and crying
out that he was a King The priests rolled great stones on us and
the regular Army fired hard and there wasnt more than six men not
counting Dan Billy Fish and Me that came down to the bottom of the
valley alive

Then they stopped firing and the horns in the temple blew again

Come awayfor Gords sake come away says Billy Fish Theyll send
runners out to all the villages before ever we get to Bashkai I can
protect you there but I cant do anything now

My own notion is that Dan began to go mad in his head from that hour
He stared up and down like a stuck pig Then he was all for walking back
alone and killing the priests with his bare hands which he could have
done An Emperor am I says Daniel and next year I shall be a Knight
of the Queen

All right Dan says I but come along now while theres time

Its your fault says he for not looking after your Army better
There was mutiny in the midst and you didnt knowyou damned
enginedriving platelaying missionaryspasshunting hound He sat
upon a rock and called me every foul name he could lay tongue to I was
too heartsick to care though it was all his foolishness that brought
the smash

Im sorry Dan says I but theres no accounting for natives This
business is our Fiftyseven Maybe well make something out of it yet
when weve got to Bashkai

Lets get to Bashkai then says Dan and by God when I come
back here again Ill sweep the valley so there isnt a bug in a blanket
left

We walked all that day and all that night Dan was stumping up and down
on the snow chewing his beard and muttering to himself

Theres no hope o getting clear said Billy Fish The priests have
sent runners to the villages to say that you are only men Why didnt
you stick on as Gods till things was more settled Im a dead man says
Billy Fish and he throws himself down on the snow and begins to pray to
his Gods

Next morning we was in a cruel bad countryall up and down no level
ground at all and no food either The six Bashkai men looked at Billy
Fish hungryway as if they wanted to ask something but they never said
a word At noon we came to the top of a flat mountain all covered with
snow and when we climbed up into it behold there was an Army in
position waiting in the middle

The runners have been very quick says Billy Fish with a little bit
of a laugh They are waiting for us

Three or four men began to fire from the enemys side and a chance
shot took Daniel in the calf of the leg That brought him to his senses
He looks across the snow at the Army and sees the rifles that we had
brought into the country

Were done for says he They are Englishmen these peopleand
its my blasted nonsense that has brought you to this Get back Billy
Fish and take your men away youve done what you could and now cut
for it Carnehan says he shake hands with me and go along with
Billy Maybe they wont kill you Ill go and meet em alone Its me
that did it Me the King

Go says I Go to Hell Dan Im with you here Billy Fish you
clear out and we two will meet those folk

Im a Chief says Billy Fish quite quiet I stay with you My men
can go

The Bashkai fellows didnt wait for a second word but ran off and Dan
and Me and Billy Fish walked across to where the drums were drumming and
the horns were horning It was coldawful cold Ive got that cold in
the back of my head now Theres a lump of it there

The punkacoolies had gone to sleep Two kerosene lamps were blazing in
the office and the perspiration poured down my face and splashed on the
blotter as I leaned forward Carnehan was shivering and I feared that
his mind might go I wiped my face took a fresh grip of the piteously
mangled hands and said What happened after that

The momentary shift of my eyes had broken the clear current

What was you pleased to say whined Carnehan They took them without
any sound Not a little whisper all along the snow not though the King
knocked down the first man that set hand on himnot though old Peachey
fired his last cartridge into the brown of em Not a single solitary
sound did those swines make They just closed up tight and I tell you
their furs stunk There was a man called Billy Fish a good friend of us
all and they cut his throat Sir then and there like a pig and the
King kicks up the bloody snow and says Weve had a dashed fine run for
our money Whats coming next But Peachey Peachey Taliaferro I tell
you Sir in confidence as betwixt two friends he lost his head Sir
No he didnt neither The King lost his head so he did all along o
one of those cunning rope bridges Kindly let me have the papercutter
Sir It tilted this way They marched him a mile across that snow to a
rope bridge over a ravine with a river at the bottom You may have seen
such They prodded him behind like an ox Damn your eyes says the
King D you suppose I cant die like a gentleman

He turns to PeacheyPeachey that was crying like a child Ive
brought you to this Peachey says he Brought you out of your happy
life to be killed in Kafiristan where you was late CommanderinChief
of the Emperors forces Say you forgive me Peachey I do says
Peachey Fully and freely do I forgive you Dan Shake hands
Peachey says he Im going now Out he goes looking neither right
nor left and when he was plumb in the middle of those dizzy dancing
ropes Cut you beggars he shouts and they cut and old Dan fell
turning round and round and round twenty thousand miles for he took
half an hour to fall till he struck the water and I could see his body
caught on a rock with the gold crown close beside

But do you know what they did to Peachey between two pine trees They
crucified him Sir as Peacheys hand will show They used wooden pegs
for his hands and feet but he didnt die He hung there and screamed
and they took him down next day and said it was a miracle that he
wasnt dead They took him downpoor old Peachey that hadnt done them
any harmthat hadnt done them any

He rocked to and fro and wept bitterly wiping his eyes with the back of
his scarred hands and moaning like a child for some ten minutes

They was cruel enough to feed him up in the temple because they said
he was more of a God than old Daniel that was a man Then they turned
him out on the snow and told him to go home and Peachey came home in
about a year begging along the roads quite safe for Daniel Dravot he
walked before and said Come along Peachey Its a big thing were
doing The mountains they danced at night and the mountains they tried
to fall on Peacheys head but Dan he held up his hand and Peachey came
along bent double He never let go of Dans hand and he never let go
of Dans head They gave it to him as a present in the temple to remind
him not to come again and though the crown was pure gold and Peachey
was starving never would Peachey sell the same You know Dravot Sir
You knew Right Worshipful Brother Dravot Look at him now

He fumbled in the mass of rags round his bent waist brought out a black
horsehair bag embroidered with silver thread and shook therefrom on to
my tablethe dried withered head of Daniel Dravot The morning sun
that had long been paling the lamps struck the red beard and blind
sunken eyes struck too a heavy circlet of gold studded with raw
turquoises that Carnehan placed tenderly on the battered temples

You beold now said Carnehan the Emperor in his abit as he
livedthe King of Kafiristan with his crown upon his head Poor old
Daniel that was a monarch once

I shuddered for in spite of defacements manifold I recognised the
head of the man of Marwar Junction Carnehan rose to go I attempted to
stop him He was not fit to walk abroad Let me take away the whisky
and give me a little money he gasped I was a King once Ill go to
the Deputy Commissioner and ask to set in the Poorhouse till I get my
health No thank you I cant wait till you get a carriage for me Ive
urgent private affairsin the southat Marwar

He shambled out of the office and departed in the direction of the
Deputy Commissioners house That day at noon I had occasion to go down
the blindinghot Mall and I saw a crooked man crawling along the white
dust of the roadside his hat in his hand quavering dolorously after
the fashion of streetsingers at Home There was not a soul in sight
and he was out of all possible earshot of the houses And he sang
through his nose turning his head from right to left

 The Son of Man goes forth to war
 A golden crown to gain
 His bloodred banner streams afar
 Who follows in His train

I waited to hear no more but put the poor wretch into my carriage and
drove him off to the nearest missionary for eventual transfer to the
Asylum He repeated the hymn twice while he was with me whom he did not
in the least recognise and I left him singing it to the missionary

Two days later I inquired after his welfare of the Superintendent of the
Asylum

He was admitted suffering from sunstroke He died early yesterday
morning said the Superintendent Is it true that he was half an hour
bareheaded in the sun at midday

Yes said I but do you happen to know if he had anything upon him by
any chance when he died

Not to my knowledge said the Superintendent

And there the matter rests

     




THE FINEST STORY IN THE WORLD

 O ever the knightly years were gone
 With the old world to the grave
 I was a king in Babylon
 And you were a Christian slave
 W E Henley

His name was Charlie Mears he was the only son of his mother who was a
widow and he lived in the north of London coming into the City
every day to work in a bank He was twenty years old and suffered from
aspirations I met him in a public billiardsaloon where the marker
called him by his given name and he called the marker Bullseyes
Charley explained a little nervously that he had only come to the
place to look on and since looking on at games of skill is not a cheap
amusement for the young I suggested that Charlie should go back to his
mother

That was our first step toward better acquaintance He would call on
me sometimes in the evenings instead of running about London with his
fellowclerks and before long speaking of himself as a young man must
he told me of his aspirations which were all literary He desired to
make himself an undying name chiefly through verse though he was not
above sending stories of love and death to the dropapennyintheslot
journals It was my fate to sit still while Charlie read me poems of
many hundred lines and bulky fragments of plays that would surely
shake the world My reward was his unreserved confidence and the
selfrevelations and troubles of a young man are almost as holy as those
of a maiden

Charlie had never fallen in love but was anxious to do so on the first
opportunity he believed in all things good and all things honorable
but at the same time was curiously careful to let me see that he
knew his way about the world as befitted a bank clerk on twentyfive
shillings a week He rhymed dove with love and moon with June
and devoutly believed that they had never so been rhymed before The
long lame gaps in his plays he filled up with hasty words of apology and
description and swept on seeing all that he intended to do so clearly
that he esteemed it already done and turned to me for applause

I fancy that his mother did not encourage his aspirations and I know
that his writingtable at home was the edge of his washstand This he
told me almost at the outset of our acquaintance when he was ravaging
my bookshelves and a little before I was implored to speak the truth
as to his chances of writing something really great you know Maybe
I encouraged him too much for one night he called on me his eyes
flaming with excitement and said breathlessly

Do you mindcan you let me stay here and write all this evening I
wont interrupt you I wont really Theres no place for me to write in
at my mothers

Whats the trouble I said knowing well what that trouble was

Ive a notion in my head that would make the most splendid story that
was ever written Do let me write it out here Its such a notion

There was no resisting the appeal I set him a table he hardly
thanked me but plunged into the work at once For half an hour the pen
scratched without stopping Then Charlie sighed and tugged his hair The
scratching grew slower there were more erasures and at last ceased
The finest story in the world would not come forth

It looks such awful rot now he said mournfully And yet it seemed so
good when I was thinking about it Whats wrong

I could not dishearten him by saying the truth So I answered Perhaps
you dont feel in the mood for writing

Yes I doexcept when I look at this stuff Ugh

Read me what youve done I said He read and it was wondrous bad
and he paused at all the specially turgid sentences expecting a little
approval for he was proud of those sentences as I knew he would be

It needs compression I suggested cautiously

I hate cutting my things down I dont think you could alter a word
here without spoiling the sense It reads better aloud than when I was
writing it

Charlie youre suffering from an alarming disease afflicting a
numerous class Put the thing by and tackle it again in a week

I want to do it at once What do you think of it

How can I judge from a halfwritten tale Tell me the story as it lies
in your head

Charlie told and in the telling there was everything that his ignorance
had so carefully prevented from escaping into the written word I looked
at him and wondering whether it were possible that he did not know the
originality the power of the notion that had come in his way It was
distinctly a Notion among notions Men had been puffed up with pride by
notions not a tithe as excellent and practicable But Charlie babbled
on serenely interrupting the current of pure fancy with samples of
horrible sentences that he purposed to use I heard him out to the end
It would be folly to allow his idea to remain in his own inept hands
when I could do so much with it Not all that could be done indeed but
oh so much

What do you think he said at last I fancy I shall call it The
Story of a Ship

I think the ideas pretty good but you wont Be able to handle it for
ever so long Now I

Would it be of any use to you Would you care to take it I should be
proud said Charlie promptly

There are few things sweeter in this world than the guileless
hotheaded intemperate open admiration of a junior Even a woman in
her blindest devotion does not fall into the gait of the man she adores
tilt her bonnet to the angle at which he wears his hat or interlard her
speech with his pet oaths And Charlie did all these things Still
it was necessary to salve my conscience before I possessed myself of
Charlies thoughts

Lets make a bargain Ill give you a fiver for the notion I said

Charlie became a bankclerk at once

Oh thats impossible Between two pals you know if I may call you
so and speaking as a man of the world I couldnt Take the notion if
its any use to you Ive heaps more

He hadnone knew this better than Ibut they were the notions of other
men

Look at it as a matter of businessbetween men of the world I
returned Five pounds will buy you any number of poetrybooks Business
is business and you may be sure I shouldnt give that price unless

Oh if you put it that way said Charlie visibly moved by the thought
of the books The bargain was clinched with an agreement that he should
at unstated intervals come to me with all the notions that he possessed
should have a table of his own to write at and unquestioned right to
inflict upon me all his poems and fragments of poems Then I said Now
tell me how you came by this idea

It came by itself Charlies eyes opened a little

Yes but you told me a great deal about the hero that you must have
read before somewhere

I havent any time for reading except when you let me sit here and
on Sundays Im on my bicycle or down the river all day Theres nothing
wrong about the hero is there

Tell me again and I shall understand clearly You say that your hero
went pirating How did he live

He was on the lower deck of this shipthing that I was telling you
about

What sort of ship

It was the kind rowed with oars and the sea spurts through the
oarholes and the men row sitting up to their knees in water Then
theres a bench running down between the two lines of oars and an
overseer with a whip walks up and down the bench to make the men work

How do you know that

Its in the table Theres a rope running overhead looped to the upper
deck for the overseer to catch hold of when the ship rolls When the
overseer misses the rope once and falls among the rowers remember the
hero laughs at him and gets licked for it Hes chained to his oar of
coursethe hero

How is he chained

With an iron band round his waist fixed to the bench he sits on and a
sort of handcuff on his left wrist chaining him to the oar Hes on the
lower deck where the worst men are sent and the only light comes from
the hatchways and through the oarholes Cant you imagine the sunlight
just squeezing through between the handle and the hole and wobbling
about as the ship moves

I can but I cant imagine your imagining it

How could it be any other way Now you listen to me The long oars on
the upper deck are managed by four men to each bench the lower ones
by three and the lowest of all by two Remember its quite dark on the
lowest deck and all the men there go mad When a man dies at his oar
on that deck he isnt thrown overboard but cut up in his chains and
stuffed through the oarhole in little pieces

Why I demanded amazed not so much at the information as the tone of
command in which it was flung out

To save trouble and to frighten the others It needs two overseers to
drag a mans body up to the top deck and if the men at the lower deck
oars were left alone of course theyd stop rowing and try to pull up
the benches by all standing up together in their chains

Youve a most provident imagination Where have you been reading about
galleys and galleyslaves

Nowhere that I remember I row a little when I get the chance But
perhaps if you say so I may have read something

He went away shortly afterward to deal with booksellers and I wondered
how a bank clerk aged twenty could put into my hands with a profligate
abundance of detail all given with absolute assurance the story of
extravagant and bloodthirsty adventure riot piracy and death in
unnamed seas He had led his hero a desperate dance through revolt
against the overseas to command of a ship of his own and ultimate
establishment of a kingdom on an island somewhere in the sea you
know and delighted with my paltry five pounds had gone out to buy
the notions of other men that these might teach him how to write I
had the consolation of knowing that this notion was mine by right of
purchase and I thought that I could make something of it

When next he came to me he was drunkroyally drunk on many poets for
the first time revealed to him His pupils were dilated his words
tumbled over each other and he wrapped himself in quotations Most of
all was he drunk with Longfellow

Isnt it splendid Isnt it superb he cried after hasty greetings

Listen to this

Wouldst thou so the helmsman answered Know the secret of the sea
Only those who brave its dangers Comprehend its mystery

By gum

Only those who brave its dangers Comprehend its mystery he repeated
twenty times walking up and down the room and forgetting me But I can
understand it too he said to himself I dont know how to thank you
for that fiver And this listen

I remember the black wharves and the ships And the seatides tossing
free And the Spanish sailors with bearded lips And the beauty and
mystery of the ships And the magic of the sea

I havent braved any dangers but I feel as if I knew all about it

You certainly seem to have a grip of the sea Have you ever seen it

When I was a little chap I went to Brighton once we used to live in
Coventry though before we came to London I never saw it

When descends on the Atlantic The gigantic Stormwind of the
Equinox

He shook me by the shoulder to make me understand the passion that was
shaking himself

When that storm comes he continued I think that all the oars in
the ship that I was talking about get broken and the rowers have their
chests smashed in by the bucking oarheads By the way have you done
anything with that notion of mine yet

No I was waiting to hear more of it from you Tell me how in the world
youre so certain about the fittings of the ship You know nothing of
ships

I dont know Its as real as anything to me until I try to write it
down I was thinking about it only last night in bed after you had
loaned me Treasure Island and I made up a whole lot of new things to
go into the story

What sort of things

About the food the men ate rotten figs and black beans and wine in a
skin bag passed from bench to bench

Was the ship built so long ago as that

As what I dont know whether it was long ago or not Its only a
notion but sometimes it seems just as real as if it was true Do I
bother you with talking about it

Not in the least Did you make up anything else

Yes but its nonsense Charlie flushed a little

Never mind lets hear about it

Well I was thinking over the story and after awhile I got out of bed
and wrote down on a piece of paper the sort of stuff the men might be
supposed to scratch on their oars with the edges of their handcuffs It
seemed to make the thing more lifelike It is so real to me yknow

Have you the paper on you

Yees but whats the use of showing it Its only a lot of scratches
All the same we might have em reproduced in the book on the front
page

Ill attend to those details Show me what your men wrote

He pulled out of his pocket a sheet of notepaper with a single line of
scratches upon it and I put this carefully away

What is it supposed to mean in English I said

Oh I dont know Perhaps it means Im beastly tired Its great
nonsense he repeated but all those men in the ship seem as real
people to me Do do something to the notion soon I should like to see
it written and printed

But all youve told me would make a long book

Make it then Youve only to sit down and write it out

Give me a little time Have you any more notions

Not just now Im reading all the books Ive bought Theyre splendid

When he had left I looked at the sheet of notepaper with the
inscription upon it Then I took my head tenderly between both hands to
make certain that it was not coming off or turning round

Thenbut there seemed to be no interval between quitting my rooms and
finding myself arguing with a policeman outside a door marked Private
in a corridor of the British Museum All I demanded as politely as
possible was the Greek antiquity man The policeman knew nothing
except the rules of the Museum and it became necessary to forage
through all the houses and offices inside the gates An elderly
gentleman called away from his lunch put an end to my search by holding
the notepaper between finger and thumb and sniffing at it scornfully

What does this mean Hmm said he So far as I can ascertain it is
an attempt to write extremely corrupt Greek on the parthere he glared
at me with intentionof an extremely illiterateahperson He read
slowly from the paper Pollock Erckman Tauchnitz Hennikerfour
names familiar to me

Can you tell me what the corruption is supposed to meanthe gist of
the thing I asked

I have beenmany timesovercome with weariness in this particular
employment That is the meaning He returned me the paper and I fled
without a word of thanks explanation or apology

I might have been excused for forgetting much To me of all men had been
given the chance to write the most marvelous tale in the world nothing
less than the story of a Greek galleyslave as told by himself Small
wonder that his dreaming had seemed real to Charlie The Fates that are
so careful to shut the doors of each successive life behind us had in
this case been neglectful and Charlie was looking though that he did
not know where never man had been permitted to look with full knowledge
since Time began Above all he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge
sold to me for five pounds and he would retain that ignorance for
bankclerks do not understand metempsychosis and a sound commercial
education does not include Greek He would supply mehere I capered
among the dumb gods of Egypt and laughed in their battered faceswith
material to make my tale sureso sure that the world would hail it as
an impudent and vamped fiction And II alone would know that it was
absolutely and literally true I alone held this jewel to my hand for
the cutting and polishing

Therefore I danced again among the gods till a policeman saw me and took
steps in my direction

It remained now only to encourage Charlie to talk and here there was no
difficulty But I had forgotten those accursed books of poetry He came
to me time after time as useless as a surcharged phonographdrunk on
Byron Shelley or Keats Knowing now what the boy had been in his past
lives and desperately anxious not to lose one word of his babble I
could not hide from him my respect and interest He misconstrued both
into respect for the present soul of Charlie Mears to whom life was as
new as it was to Adam and interest in his readings and stretched my
patience to breaking point by reciting poetrynot his own now but
that of others I wished every English poet blotted out of the memory of
mankind I blasphemed the mightiest names of song because they had drawn
Charlie from the path of direct narrative and would later spur him to
imitate them but I choked down my impatience until the first flood of
enthusiasm should have spent itself and the boy returned to his dreams

Whats the use of my telling you what I think when these chaps wrote
things for the angels to read he growled one evening Why dont you
write something like theirs

I dont think youre treating me quite fairly I said speaking under
strong restraint

Ive given you the story he said shortly replunging into Lara

But I want the details

The things I make up about that damned ship that you call a galley
Theyre quite easy You can just make em up yourself Turn up the gas a
little I want to go on reading

I could have broken the gas globe over his head for his amazing
stupidity I could indeed make up things for myself did I only know what
Charlie did not know that he knew But since the doors were shut behind
me I could only wait his youthful pleasure and strive to keep him
in good temper One minutes want of guard might spoil a priceless
revelation now and again he would toss his books asidehe kept them
in my rooms for his mother would have been shocked at the waste of
good money had she seen themand launched into his sea dreams Again I
cursed all the poets of England The plastic mind of the bankclerk had
been overlaid colored and distorted by that which he had read and the
result as delivered was a confused tangle of other voices most like the
muttered song through a City telephone in the busiest part of the day

He talked of the galleyhis own galley had he but known itwith
illustrations borrowed from the Bride of Abydos He pointed the
experiences of his hero with quotations from The Corsair and threw
in deep and desperate moral reflections from Cain and Manfred
expecting me to use them all Only when the talk turned on Longfellow
were the jarring crosscurrents dumb and I knew that Charlie was
speaking the truth as he remembered it

What do you think of this I said one evening as soon as I understood
the medium in which his memory worked best and before he could
expostulate read him the whole of The Saga of King Olaf

He listened openmouthed flushed his hands drumming on the back of the
sofa where he lay till I came to the Songs of Emar Tamberskelver and
the verse

Emar then the arrow taking From the loosened string Answered That
was Norway breaking Neath thy hand O King

He gasped with pure delight of sound

Thats better than Byron a little I ventured

Better Why its true How could he have known

I went back and repeated

 What was that said Olaf standing
 On the quarterdeck
 Something heard I like the stranding
 Of a shattered wreck

How could he have known how the ships crash and the oars rip out and go
zzzp all along the line Why only the other nightBut go back please
and read The Skerry of Shrieks again

No Im tired Lets talk What happened the other night

I had an awful nightmare about that galley of ours I dreamed I was
drowned in a fight You see we ran alongside another ship in harbor The
water was dead still except where our oars whipped it up You know where
I always sit in the galley He spoke haltingly at first under a fine
English fear of being laughed at

No Thats news to me I answered meekly my heart beginning to beat

On the fourth oar from the bow on the right side on the upper deck
There were four of us at the oar all chained I remember watching the
water and trying to get my handcuffs off before the row began Then we
closed up on the other ship and all their fighting men jumped over our
bulwarks and my bench broke and I was pinned down with the three other
fellows on top of me and the big oar jammed across our backs

Well Charlies eyes were alive and alight He was looking at the wall
behind my chair

I dont know how we fought The men were trampling all over my back
and I lay low Then our rowers on the left sidetied to their oars you
knowbegan to yell and back water I could hear the water sizzle and
we spun round like a cockchafer and I knew lying where I was that
there was a galley coming up bowon to ram us on the left side I could
just lift up my head and see her sail over the bulwarks We wanted to
meet her bow to bow but it was too late We could only turn a little
bit because the galley on our right had hooked herself on to us and
stopped our moving Then by gum there was a crash Our left oars began
to break as the other galley the moving one yknow stuck her nose into
them Then the lowerdeck oars shot up through the deckplanking butt
first and one of them jumped clean up into the air and came down again
close to my head

How was that managed

The moving galleys bow was plunking them back through their own
oarholes and I could hear the devil of a shindy in the decks below
Then her nose caught us nearly in the middle and we tilted sideways
and the fellows in the righthand galley unhitched their hooks and
ropes and threw things on to our upper deckarrows and hot pitch or
something that stung and we went up and up and up on the left side
and the right side dipped and I twisted my head round and saw the water
stand still as it topped the right bulwarks and then it curled over and
crashed down on the whole lot of us on the right side and I felt it hit
my back and I woke

One minute Charlie When the sea topped the bulwarks what did it look
like I had my reasons for asking A man of my acquaintance had
once gone down with a leaking ship in a still sea and had seen the
waterlevel pause for an instant ere it fell on the deck

It looked just like a banjostring drawn tight and it seemed to stay
there for years said Charlie

Exactly The other man had said It looked like a silver wire laid down
along the bulwarks and I thought it was never going to break He had
paid everything except the bare life for this little valueless piece of
knowledge and I had traveled ten thousand weary miles to meet him
and take his knowledge at second hand But Charlie the bankclerk on
twentyfive shillings a week he who had never been out of sight of a
London omnibus knew it all It was no consolation to me that once in
his lives he had been forced to die for his gains I also must have died
scores of times but behind me because I could have used my knowledge
the doors were shut

And then I said trying to put away the devil of envy

The funny thing was though in all the mess I didnt feel a bit
astonished or frightened It seemed as if Id been in a good many
fights because I told my next man so when the row began But that cad
of an overseer on my deck wouldnt unloose our chains and give us a
chance He always said that wed all Be set free after a battle but we
never were We never were Charlie shook his head mournfully

What a scoundrel

I should say he was He never gave us enough to eat and sometimes
we were so thirsty that we used to drink saltwater I can taste that
saltwater still

Now tell me something about the harbor where the fight was fought

I didnt dream about that I know it was a harbor though because we
were tied up to a ring on a white wall and all the face of the stone
under water was covered with wood to prevent our ram getting chipped
when the tide made us rock

Thats curious Our hero commanded the galley Didnt he

Didnt he just He stood by the bows and shouted like a good un He
was the man who killed the overseer

But you were all drowned together Charlie werent you

I cant make that fit quite he said with a puzzled look The galley
must have gone down with all hands and yet I fancy that the hero went on
living afterward Perhaps he climbed into the attacking ship I wouldnt
see that of course I was dead you know

He shivered slightly and protested that he could remember no more

I did not press him further but to satisfy myself that he lay in
ignorance of the workings of his own mind deliberately introduced him
to Mortimer Collinss Transmigration and gave him a sketch of the
plot before he opened the pages

What rot it all is he said frankly at the end of an hour I dont
understand his nonsense about the Red Planet Mars and the King and the
rest of it Chuck me the Longfellow again

I handed him the book and wrote out as much as I could remember of his
description of the seafight appealing to him from time to time for
confirmation of fact or detail He would answer without raising his eyes
from the book as assuredly as though all his knowledge lay before flint
on the printed page I spoke under the normal key of my voice that the
current might not be broken and I know that he was not aware of what he
was saying for his thoughts were out on the sea with Longfellow

Charlie I asked when the rowers on the galleys mutinied how did
they kill their overseers

Tore up the benches and brained em That happened when a heavy sea was
running An overseer on the lower deck slipped from the centre plank and
fell among the rowers They choked him to death against the side of the
ship with their chained hands quite quietly and it was too dark for the
other overseer to see what had happened When he asked he was pulled
down too and choked and the lower deck fought their way up deck by
deck with the pieces of the broken benches banging behind em How they
howled

And what happened after that

I dont know The hero went awayred hair and red beard and all That
was after he had captured our galley I think

The sound of my voice irritated him and he motioned slightly with his
left hand as a man does when interruption jars

You never told me he was redheaded before or that he captured your
galley I said after a discreet interval

Charlie did not raise his eyes

He was as red as a red bear said he abstractedly He came from the
north they said so in the galley when he looked for rowersnot slaves
but free men Afterwardyears and years afterwardnews came from
another ship or else he came backHis lips moved in silence He was
rapturously retasting some poem before him

Where had he been then I was almost whispering that the sentence
might come gentle to whichever section of Charlies brain was working on
my behalf

To the Beachesthe Long and Wonderful Beaches was the reply after a
minute of silence

To Furdurstrandi I asked tingling from head to foot

Yes to Furdurstrandi he pronounced the word in a new fashion And I
too sawThe voice failed

Do you know what you have said I shouted incautiously

He lifted his eyes fully roused now No he snapped I wish youd
let a chap go on reading Hark to this

But Othere the old sea captain He neither paused nor stirred Till
the king listened and then

 Once more took up his pen
 And wrote down every word

 And to the King of the Saxons
 In witness of the truth
 Raising his noble head
 He stretched his brown hand and said
 Behold this walrus tooth

By Jove what chaps those must have been to go sailing all over the
shop never knowing where theyd fetch the land Hah

Charlie I pleaded if youll only be sensible for a minute or two
Ill make our hero in our tale every inch as good as Othere

Umph Longfellow wrote that poem I dont care about writing things
any more I want to read He was thoroughly out of tune now and raging
over my own illluck I left him

Conceive yourself at the door of the worlds treasurehouse guarded by a
childan idle irresponsible child playing knuckleboneson whose favor
depends the gift of the key and you will imagine onehalf my torment
Till that evening Charlie had spoken nothing that might not lie within
the experiences of a Greek galleyslave But now or there was no virtue
in books he had talked of some desperate adventure of the Vikings of
Thorfin Karlsefnes sailing to Wineland which is America in the ninth
or tenth century The battle in the harbor he had seen and his own
death he had described But this was a much more startling plunge into
the past Was it possible that he had skipped half a dozen lives and was
then dimly remembering some episode of a thousand years later It was
a maddening jumble and the worst of it was that Charlie Mears in his
normal condition was the last person in the world to clear it up I
could only wait and watch but I went to bed that night full of the
wildest imaginings There was nothing that was not possible if Charlies
detestable memory only held good

I might rewrite the Saga of Thorfin Karlsefne as it had never been
written before might tell the story of the first discovery of America
myself the discoverer But I was entirely at Charlies mercy and so
long as there was a threeandsixpenny Bohn volume within his reach
Charlie would not tell I dared not curse him openly I hardly dared jog
his memory for I was dealing with the experiences of a thousand years
ago told through the mouth of a boy of today and a boy of today is
affected by every change of tone and gust of opinion so that he lies
even when he desires to speak the truth

I saw no more of him for nearly a week When next I met him it was in
Gracechurch Street with a billbook chained to his waist

Business took him over London Bridge and I accompanied him He was very
full of the importance of that book and magnified it

As we passed over the Thames we paused to look at a steamer unloading
great slabs of white and brown marble A barge drifted under the
steamers stern and a lonely cow in that barge bellowed

Charlies face changed from the face of the bankclerk to that of an
unknown andthough he would not have believed thisa much shrewder
man He flung out his arm across the parapet of the bridge and laughing
very loudly said When they heard our bulls bellow the Skroelings ran
away

I waited only for an instant but the barge and the cow had disappeared
under the bows of the steamer before I answered

Charlie what do you suppose are Skroelings

Never heard of em before They sound like a new kind of seagull What
a chap you are for asking questions he replied I have to go to the
cashier of the Omnibus Company yonder Will you wait for me and we can
lunch somewhere together Ive a notion for a poem

No thanks Im off Youre sure you know nothing about Skroelings

Not unless hes been entered for the Liverpool Handicap He nodded and
disappeared in the crowd

Now it is written in the Saga of Eric the Red or that of Thorfin
Karlsefne that nine hundred years ago when Karlsefnes galleys came
to Leifs booths which Leif had erected in the unknown land
called Markland which may or may not have been Rhode Island the
Skroelingsand the Lord He knows who these may or may not have
beencame to trade with the Vikings and ran away because they were
frightened at the bellowing of the cattle which Thorfin had brought with
him in the ships But what in the world could a Greek slave know of that
affair I wandered up and down among the streets trying to unravel the
mystery and the more I considered it the more baffling it grew One
thing only seemed certain and that certainty took away my breath for the
moment If I came to full knowledge of anything at all it would not be
one life of the soul in Charlie Mearss body but half a dozenhalf a
dozen several and separate existences spent on blue water in the morning
of the world

Then I walked round the situation

Obviously if I used my knowledge I should stand alone and unapproachable
until all men were as wise as myself That would be something but
manlike I was ungrateful It seemed bitterly unfair that Charlies
memory should fail me when I needed it most

Great Powers aboveI looked up at them through the fog smokedid the
Lords of Life and Death know what this meant to me Nothing less than
eternal fame of the best kind that comes from One and is shared by one
alone I would be contentremembering Clive I stood astounded at my
own moderationwith the mere right to tell one story to work out one
little contribution to the light literature of the day If Charlie were
permitted full recollection for one hourfor sixty short minutesof
existences that had extended over a thousand yearsI would forego all
profit and honor from all that I should make of his speech I would take
no share in the commotion that would follow throughout the particular
corner of the earth that calls itself the world The thing should be
put forth anonymously Nay I would make other men believe that they had
written it They would hire bullhided selfadvertising Englishmen to
bellow it abroad Preachers would found a fresh conduct of life upon it
swearing that it was new and that they had lifted the fear of death from
all mankind Every Orientalist in Europe would patronize it discursively
with Sanskrit and Pali texts Terrible women would invent unclean
variants of the mens belief for the elevation of their sisters
Churches and religions would war over it Between the hailing and
restarting of an omnibus I foresaw the scuffles that would arise among
half a dozen denominations all professing the doctrine of the True
Metempsychosis as applied to the world and the New Era and saw too
the respectable English newspapers shying like frightened kine
over the beautiful simplicity of the tale The mind leaped forward a
hundredtwo hundreda thousand years I saw with sorrow that men would
mutilate and garble the story that rival creeds would turn it upside
down till at last the western world which clings to the dread of death
more closely than the hope of life would set it aside as an interesting
superstition and stampede after some faith so long forgotten that it
seemed altogether new Upon this I changed the terms of the bargain that
I would make with the Lords of Life and Death Only let me know let me
write the story with sure knowledge that I wrote the truth and I would
burn the manuscript as a solemn sacrifice Five minutes after the last
line was written I would destroy it all But I must be allowed to write
it with absolute certainty

There was no answer The flaming colors of an Aquarium poster caught my
eye and I wondered whether it would be wise or prudent to lure Charlie
into the hands of the professional mesmerist and whether if he were
under his power he would speak of his past lives If he did and if
people believed himbut Charlie would be frightened and flustered or
made conceited by the interviews In either case he would begin to lie
through fear or vanity He was safest in my own hands

They are very funny fools your English said a voice at my elbow and
turning round I recognized a casual acquaintance a young Bengali law
student called Grish Chunder whose father had sent him to England to
become civilized The old man was a retired native official and on an
income of five pounds a month contrived to allow his son two hundred
pounds a year and the run of his teeth in a city where he could pretend
to be the cadet of a royal house and tell stories of the brutal Indian
bureaucrats who ground the faces of the poor

Grish Chunder was a young fat fullbodied Bengali dressed with
scrupulous care in frock coat tall hat light trousers and tan gloves
But I had known him in the days when the brutal Indian Government paid
for his university education and he contributed cheap sedition to Sachi
Durpan and intrigued with the wives of his schoolmates

That is very funny and very foolish he said nodding at the poster
I am going down to the Northbrook Club Will you come too

I walked with him for some time You are not well he said What is
there in your mind You do not talk

Grish Chunder youve been too well educated to believe in a God
havent you

Oah yes here But when I go home I must conciliate popular
superstition and make ceremonies of purification and my women will
anoint idols

And bang up tulsi and feast the purohit and take you back into
caste again and make a good khuttri of you again you advanced social
Freethinker And youll eat desi food and like it all from the smell
in the courtyard to the mustard oil over you

I shall very much like it said Grish Chunder unguardedly Once a
Hindualways a Hindu But I like to know what the English think they
know

Ill tell you something that one Englishman knows Its an old tale to
you

I began to tell the story of Charlie in English but Grish Chunder put
a question in the vernacular and the history went forward naturally in
the tongue best suited for its telling After all it could never have
been told in English Grish Chunder heard me nodding from time to time
and then came up to my rooms where I finished the tale

Beshak he said philosophically Lekin darwaza band hai Without
doubt but the door is shut I have heard of this remembering of
previous existences among my people It is of course an old tale with
us but to happen to an Englishmana cowfed Malechkan outcast By
Jove that is most peculiar

Outcast yourself Grish Chunder You eat cowbeef every day Lets
think the thing over The boy remembers his incarnations

Does he know that said Grish Chunder quietly swinging his legs as
he sat on my table He was speaking in English now

He does not know anything Would I speak to you if he did Go on

There is no going on at all If you tell that to your friends they will
say you are mad and put it in the papers Suppose now you prosecute
for libel

Lets leave that out of the question entirely Is there any chance of
his being made to speak

There is a chance Oah yess But if he spoke it would mean that all
this world would end nowinstantofall down on your head These things
are not allowed you know As I said the door is shut

Not a ghost of a chance

How can there be You are a Christian and it is forbidden to eat in
your books of the Tree of Life or else you would never die How shall
you all fear death if you all know what your friend does not know that
he knows I am afraid to be kicked but I am not afraid to die because
I know what I know You are not afraid to be kicked but you are afraid
to die If you were not by God you English would be all over the shop
in an hour upsetting the balances of power and making commotions It
would not be good But no fear He will remember a little and a little
less and he will call it dreams Then he will forget altogether When
I passed my First Arts Examination in Calcutta that was all in the
crambook on Wordsworth Trailing clouds of glory you know

This seems to be an exception to the rule

There are no exceptions to rules Some are not so hardlooking as
others but they are all the same when you touch If this friend of
yours said soandso and soandso indicating that he remembered all
his lost lives or one piece of a lost life he would not be in the bank
another hour He would be what you called sack because he was mad and
they would send him to an asylum for lunatics You can see that my
friend

Of course I can but I wasnt thinking of him His name need never
appear in the story

Ah I see That story will never be written You can try

I am going to

For your own credit and for the sake of money of course

No For the sake of writing the story On my honor that will be all

Even then there is no chance You cannot play with the Gods It is a
very pretty story now As they say Let it go on thatI mean at that
Be quick he will not last long

How do you mean

What I say He has never so far thought about a woman

Hasnt he though I remembered some of Charlies confidences

I mean no woman has thought about him When that comes bushogyaall
up I know There are millions of women here Housemaids for instance

I winced at the thought of my story being ruined by a housemaid

And yet nothing was more probable

Grish Chunder grinned

Yesalso pretty girlscousins of his house and perhaps not of his
house One kiss that he gives back again and remembers will cure all
this nonsense or else

Or else what Remember he does not know that he knows

I know that Or else if nothing happens he will become immersed in the
trade and the financial speculations like the rest It must be so You
can see that it must be so But the woman will come first I think

There was a rap at the door and Charlie charged in impetuously He had
been released from office and by the look in his eyes I could see
that he had come over for a long talk most probably with poems in his
pockets Charlies poems were very wearying but sometimes they led him
to talk about the galley

Grish Chunder looked at him keenly for a minute

I beg your pardon Charlie said uneasily I didnt know you had any
one with you

I am going said Grish Chunder

He drew me into the lobby as he departed

That is your man he said quickly I tell you he will never speak
all you wish That is rotbosh But he would be most good to make to
see things Suppose now we pretend that it was only playI had never
seen Grish Chunder so excitedand pour the inkpool into his hand
Eh what do you think I tell you that he could see anything that a man
could see Let me get the ink and the camphor He is a seer and he will
tell us very many things

He may be all you say but Im not going to trust him to your Gods and
devils

It will not hurt him He will only feel a little stupid and dull when
he wakes up You have seen boys look into the inkpool before

That is the reason why I am not going to see it any more Youd better
go Grish Chunder

He went declaring far down the staircase that it was throwing away my
only chance of looking into the future

This left me unmoved for I was concerned for the past and no peering
of hypnotized boys into mirrors and inkpools would help me do that But
I recognized Grish Chunders point of view and sympathized with it

What a big black brute that was said Charlie when I returned to
him Well look here Ive just done a poem dil it instead of playing
dominoes after lunch May I read it

Let me read it to myself

Then you miss the proper expression Besides you always make my things
sound as if the rhymes were all wrong

Read it aloud then Youre like the rest of em

Charlie mouthed me his poem and it was not much worse than the average
of his verses He had been reading his book faithfully but he was not
pleased when I told him that I preferred my Longfellow undiluted with
Charlie

Then we began to go through the MS line by line Charlie parrying every
objection and correction with Yes that may be better but you dont
catch what Im driving at

Charlie was in one way at least very like one kind of poet

There was a pencil scrawl at the back of the paper and Whats that I
said

Oh thats not poetry t all Its some rot I wrote last night before I
went to bed and it was too much bother to hunt for rhymes so I made it
a sort of a blank verse instead

Here is Charlies blank verse

We pulled for you when the wind was against us and the sails were low

Will you never let us go

We ate bread and onions when you took towns or ran aboard quickly when
you were beaten back by the foe

The captains walked up and down the deck in fair weather singing songs
but we were below

We fainted with our chins on the oars and you did not see that we were
idle for we still swung to and fro

Will you never let us go

The salt made the oar handles like sharkskin our knees were cut to the
bone with salt cracks our hair was stuck to our foreheads and our lips
were cut to our gums and you whipped us because we could not row

Will you never let us go

But in a little time we shall run out of the portholes as the water
runs along the oarblade and though you tell the others to row after us
you will never catch us till you catch the oarthresh and tie up the
winds in the belly of the sail Aho Will you never let us go

Hm Whats oarthresh Charlie

The water washed up by the oars Thats the sort of song they might
sing in the galley yknow Arent you ever going to finish that story
and give me some of the profits

It depends on yourself If you had only told me more about your hero in
the first instance it might have been finished by now Youre so hazy in
your notions

I only want to give you the general notion of itthe knocking about
from place to place and the fighting and all that Cant you fill in the
rest yourself Make the hero save a girl on a pirategalley and marry
her or do something

Youre a really helpful collaborator I suppose the hero went through
some few adventures before he married

Well then make him a very artful carda low sort of mana sort
of political man who went about making treaties and breaking thema
blackhaired chap who hid behind the mast when the fighting began

But you said the other day that he was redhaired

I couldnt have Make him blackhaired of course Youve no
imagination

Seeing that I had just discovered the entire principles upon which the
halfmemory falsely called imagination is based I felt entitled to
laugh but forbore for the sake of the tale

Youre right Youre the man with imagination A blackhaired chap in a
decked ship I said

No an open shiplike a big boat

This was maddening

Your ship has been built and designed closed and decked in you said
so yourself I protested

No no not that ship That was open or half decked becauseBy Jove
youre right You made me think of the hero as a redhaired chap
Of course if he were red the ship would be an open one with painted
sails

Surely I thought he would remember now that he had served in two
galleys at leastin a threedecked Greek one under the blackhaired
political man and again in a Vikings open seaserpent under the
man red as a red bear who went to Markland The devil prompted me to
speak

Why of course Charlie said I I dont know Are you making fun
of me

The current was broken for the time being I took up a notebook and
pretended to make many entries in it

Its a pleasure to work with an imaginative chap like yourself I said
after a pause The way that youve brought out the character of the
hero is simply wonderful

Do you think so he answered with a pleased flush I often tell
myself that theres more in me than mythan people think

Theres an enormous amount in you

Then wont you let me send an essay on The Ways of Bank Clerks to
TitBits and get the guinea prize

That wasnt exactly what I meant old fellow perhaps it would be
better to wait a little and go ahead with the galleystory

Ah but I shant get the credit of that TitBits would publish my
name and address if I win What are you grinning at They would

I know it Suppose you go for a walk I want to look through my notes
about our story

Now this reprehensible youth who left me a little hurt and put back
might for aught he or I knew have been one of the crew of the Argohad
been certainly slave or comrade to Thorfin Karlsefne Therefore he was
deeply interested in guinea competitions Remembering what Grish Chunder
had said I laughed aloud The Lords of Life and Death would never allow
Charlie Mears to speak with full knowledge of his pasts and I must even
piece out what he had told me with my own poor inventions while Charlie
wrote of the ways of bankclerks

I got together and placed on one file all my notes and the net result
was not cheering I read them a second time There was nothing that
might not have been compiled at secondhand from other peoples
booksexcept perhaps the story of the fight in the harbor The
adventures of a Viking bad been written many times before the history
of a Greek galleyslave was no new thing and though I wrote both who
could challenge or confirm the accuracy of my details I might as well
tell a tale of two thousand years hence The Lords of Life and Death
were as cunning as Grish Chunder had hinted They would allow nothing
to escape that might trouble or make easy the minds of men Though I
was convinced of this yet I could not leave the tale alone Exaltation
followed reaction not once but twenty times in the next few weeks My
moods varied with the March sunlight and flying clouds By night or in
the beauty of a spring morning I perceived that I could write that tale
and shift continents thereby In the wet windy afternoons I saw that
the tale might indeed be written but would be nothing more than a
faked falsevarnished shamrusted piece of Wardour Street work at the
end Then I blessed Charlie in many waysthough it was no fault of his
He seemed to be busy with prize competitions and I saw less and less of
him as the weeks went by and the earth cracked and grew ripe to spring
and the buds swelled in their sheaths He did not care to read or talk
of what he had read and there was a new ring of selfassertion in
his voice I hardly cared to remind him of the galley when we met but
Charlie alluded to it on every occasion always as a story from which
money was to be made

I think I deserve twentyfive per cent dont I at least he said
with beautiful frankness I supplied all the ideas didnt I

This greediness for silver was a new side in his nature I assumed that
it had been developed in the City where Charlie was picking up the
curious nasal drawl of the underbred City man

When the things done well talk about it I cant make anything of it
at present Redhaired or blackhaired hero are equally difficult

He was sitting by the fire staring at the red coals I cant understand
what you find so difficult Its all as clean as mud to me he replied
A jet of gas puffed out between the bars took light and whistled
softly Suppose we take the redhaired heros adventures first from
the time that he came south to my galley and captured it and sailed to
the Beaches

I knew better now than to interrupt Charlie I was out of reach of
pen and paper and dared not move to get them lest I should break the
current The gasjet puffed and whinnied Charlies voice dropped almost
to a whisper and he told a tale of the sailing of an open galley to
Furdurstrandi of sunsets on the open sea seen under the curve of the
one sail evening after evening when the galleys beak was notched into
the centre of the sinking disc and we sailed by that for we had no
other guide quoth Charlie He spoke of a landing on an island and
explorations in its woods where the crew killed three men whom they
found asleep under the pines Their ghosts Charlie said followed the
galley swimming and choking in the water and the crew cast lots and
threw one of their number overboard as a sacrifice to the strange gods
whom they had offended Then they ate seaweed when their provisions
failed and their legs swelled and their leader the redhaired man
killed two rowers who mutinied and after a year spent among the woods
they set sail for their own country and a wind that never failed
carried them back so safely that they all slept at night This and much
more Charlie told Sometimes the voice fell so low that I could not
catch the words though every nerve was on the strain He spoke of their
leader the redhaired man as a pagan speaks of his God for it was he
who cheered them and slew them impartially as he thought best for their
needs and it was he who steered them for three days among floating ice
each floe crowded with strange beasts that tried to sail with us said
Charlie and we beat them back with the handles of the oars

The gasjet went out a burned coal gave way and the fire settled down
with a tiny crash to the bottom of the grate Charlie ceased speaking
and I said no word

By Jove he said at last shaking his head Ive been staring at the
fire till Im dizzy What was I going to say

Something about the galley

I remember now Its 25 per cent of the profits isnt it

Its anything you like when Ive done the tale

I wanted to be sure of that I must go now Ive Ive an appointment
And he left me

Had my eyes not been held I might have known that that broken muttering
over the fire was the swansong of Charlie Mears But I thought it the
prelude to fuller revelation At last and at last I should cheat the
Lords of Life and Death

When next Charlie came to me I received him with rapture He was nervous
and embarrassed but his eyes were very full of light and his lips a
little parted

Ive done a poem he said and then quickly its the best Ive ever
done Read it He thrust it into my hand and retreated to the window

I groaned inwardly It would be the work of half an hour to
criticisethat is to say praisethe poem sufficiently to please
Charlie Then I had good reason to groan for Charlie discarding his
favorite centipede metres had launched into shorter and choppier verse
and verse with a motive at the back of it This is what I read

 The day is most fair the cheery wind
 Halloos behind the hill
 Where bends the wood as seemeth good

 And the sapling to his will
 Riot O wind there is that in my blood
 That would not have thee still

 She gave me herself O Earth O Sky
 Grey sea she is mine aloneI
 Let the sullen boulders hear my cry
 And rejoice tho they be but stone

 Mine I have won her O good brown earth
 Make merry Tis bard on Spring
 Make merry my love is doubly worth
 All worship your fields can bring
 Let the hind that tills you feel my mirth
 At the early harrowing

Yes its the early harrowing past a doubt I said with a dread at
my heart Charlie smiled but did not answer

 Red cloud of the sunset tell it abroad I am victor
 Greet me O Sun Dominant master and absolute lord
 Over the soul of one

Well said Charlie looking over my shoulder

I thought it far from well and very evil indeed when he silently laid
a photograph on the paperthe photograph of a girl with a curly head
and a foolish slack mouth

Isnt itisnt it wonderful he whispered pink to the tips of his
ears wrapped in the rosy mystery of first love I didnt know I
didnt thinkit came like a thunderclap

Yes It comes like a thunderclap Are you very happy Charlie

My Godsheshe loves me He sat down repeating the last words to
himself I looked at the hairless face the narrow shoulders already
bowed by deskwork and wondered when where and bow he had loved in
his past lives

What will your mother say I asked cheerfully

I dont care a damn what she says

At twenty the things for which one does not care a damn should
properly be many but one must not include mothers in the list I told
him this gently and he described Her even as Adam must have described
to the newly named beasts the glory and tenderness and beauty of Eve
Incidentally I learned that She was a tobacconists assistant with a
weakness for pretty dress and had told him four or five times already
that She had never been kissed by a man before

Charlie spoke on and on and on while I separated from him by
thousands of years was considering the beginnings of things Now I
understood why the Lords of Life and Death shut the doors so carefully
behind us It is that we may not remember our first wooings Were it not
so our world would be without inhabitants in a hundred years

Now about that galleystory I said still more cheerfully in a
pause in the rush of the speech

Charlie looked up as though he had been hit The galleywhat galley
Good heavens dont joke man This is serious You dont know how
serious it is

Grish Chunder was right Charlie had tasted the love of woman that kills
remembrance and the finest story in the world would never be written

     




VOLUME IV UNDER THE DEODARS




THE EDUCATION OF OTIS YEERE


I

 In the pleasant orchardcloses
 God bless all our gains say we
 But May God bless all our losses
 Better suits with our degree
 The Lost Bower

This is the history of a failure but the woman who failed said that it
might be an instructive tale to put into print for the benefit of the
younger generation The younger generation does not want instruction
being perfectly willing to instruct if any one will listen to it None
the less here begins the story where every rightminded story should
begin that is to say at Simla where all things begin and many come to
an evil end

The mistake was due to a very clever woman making a blunder and not
retrieving it Men are licensed to stumble but a clever womans mistake
is outside the regular course of Nature and Providence since all good
people know that a woman is the only infallible thing in this world
except Government Paper of the 70 issue bearing interest at four and
a half per cent Yet we have to remember that six consecutive days of
rehearsing the leading part of The Fallen Age at the New Gaiety Theatre
where the plaster is not yet properly dry might have brought about an
unhingement of spirits which again might have led to eccentricities

Mrs Hauksbee came to The Foundry to tiffin with Mrs Mallowe her one
bosom friend for she was in no sense a womans woman And it was a
womans tiffin the door shut to all the world and they both talked
chiffons which is French for Mysteries

Ive enjoyed an interval of sanity Mrs Hauksbee announced after
tiffin was over and the two were comfortably settled in the little
writingroom that opened out of Mrs Mallowes bedroom

My dear girl what has he done said Mrs Mallowe sweetly It is
noticeable that ladies of a certain age call each other dear girl
just as commissioners of twentyeight years standing address their
equals in the Civil List as my boy

Theres no he in the case Who am I that an imaginary man should be
always credited to me Am I an Apache

No dear but somebodys scalp is generally drying at your wigwamdoor
Soaking rather

This was an allusion to the Hawley Boy who was in the habit of riding
all across Simla in the Rains to call on Mrs Hauksbee That lady
laughed

For my sins the Aide at Tyrconnel last night told me off to The
Mussuck Hsh Dont laugh One of my most devoted admirers When the
duff camesome one really ought to teach them to make pudding at
TyrconnelThe Mussuck was at liberty to attend to me

Sweet soul I know his appetite said Mrs Mallowe Did he oh did
he begin his wooing

By a special mercy of Providence no He explained his importance as a
Pillar of the Empire I didnt laugh

Lucy I dont believe you

Ask Captain Sangar he was on the other side Well as I was saying
The Mussuck dilated

I think I can see him doing it said Mrs Mallowe pensively
scratching her foxterriers ears

I was properly impressed Most properly I yawned openly Strict
supervision and play them off one against the other said The
Mussuck shoveling down his ice by tureenfuls I assure you That Mrs
Hauksbee is the secret of our Government

Mrs Mallowe laughed long and merrily And what did you say

Did you ever know me at loss for an answer yet I said So I have
observed in my dealings with you The Mussuck swelled with pride He is
coming to call on me tomorrow The Hawley Boy is coming too

Strict supervision and play them off one against the other That Mrs
Hauksbee is the secret of our Government And I dare say if we could
get to The Mussucks heart we should find that he considers himself a
man of the world

As he is of the other two things I like The Mussuck and I wont have
you call him names He amuses me

He has reformed you too by what appears Explain the interval of
sanity and hit Tim on the nose with the papercutter please That dog
is too fond of sugar Do you take milk in yours

No thanks Polly Im wearied of this life Its hollow

Turn religious then I always said that Rome would be your fate

Only exchanging half a dozen attaches in red for one and in black and
if I fasted the wrinkles would come and never never go Has it ever
struck you dear that Im getting old

Thanks for your courtesy Ill return it Yees we are both not
exactlyhow shall I put it

What we have been I feel it in my bones as Mrs Crossley says
Polly Ive wasted my life

As how

Never mind how I feel it I want to be a Power before I die

Be a Power then Youve wits enough for anythingand beauty

Mrs Hauksbee pointed a teaspoon straight at her hostess Polly if you
heap compliments on me like this I shall cease to believe that youre a
woman Tell me how I am to be a Power

Inform The Mussuck that he is the most fascinating and slimmest man in
Asia and hell tell you anything and everything you please

Bother The Mussuck I mean an intellectual Powernot a gaspower
Polly Im going to start a salon

Mrs Mallowe turned lazily on the sofa and rested her head on her hand
Hear the words of the Preacher the son of Baruch she said

Will you talk sensibly

I will dear for I see that you are going to make a mistake

I never made a mistake in my life at least never one that I couldnt
explain away afterward

Going to make a mistake went on Mrs Mallowe composedly It is
impossible to start a salon in Simla A bar would be much more to the
point

Perhaps but why It seems so easy

Just what makes it so difficult How many clever women are there in
Simla

Myself and yourself said Mrs Hauksbee without a moments
hesitation

Modest woman Mrs Feardon would thank you for that And how many
clever men

Oherhundreds said Mrs Hauksbee vaguely

What a fatal blunder Not one They are all bespoke of the Government
Take my husband for instance Jack was a clever man though I say so
who shouldnt Government has eaten him up All his ideas and powers of
conversationhe really used to be a good talker even to his wife
in the old daysare taken from him by thisthis kitchensink of a
Government Thats the case with every man up here who is at work I
dont suppose a Russian convict under the knout is able to amuse the
rest of his gang and all our menfolk here are gilded convicts

But there are scores

I know what youre going to say Scores of idle men up on leave I
admit it but they are all of two objectionable sets The Civilian whod
be delightful if he had the military mans knowledge of the world and
style and the military man whod be adorable if lie had the Civilians
culture

Detestable word Have Civilians Culchaw I never studied the breed
deeply

Dont make fun of Jacks service Yes Theyre like the teapots in the
Lakka Bazargood material but not polished They cant help themselves
poor dears A Civilian only begins to be tolerable after he has knocked
about the world for fifteen years

And a military man

When he has had the same amount of service The young of both species
are horrible You would have scores of them in your salon

I would not said Mrs Hauksbee fiercely I would tell the bearer to
darwaza band them Id put their own colonels and commissioners at the
door to turn them away Id give them to the Topsham girl to play with

The Topsham girl would be grateful for the gift But to go back to the
salon Allowing that you had gathered all your men and women together
what would you do with them Make them talk They would all with one
accord begin to flirt Your salon would become a glorified Pelitisa
Scandal Point by lamplight

Theres a certain amount of wisdom in that view

Theres all the wisdom in the world in it Surely twelve Simla seasons
ought to have taught you that you cant focus anything in India and
a salon to be any good at all must be permanent In two seasons your
roomful would be scattered all over Asia We are only little bits of
dirt on the hillsideshere one day and blown down the khud the next
We have lost the art of talkingat least our men have We have no
cohesion

George Eliot in the flesh interpolated Mrs Hauksbee wickedly

And collectively my dear scoffer we men and women alike have no
influence

Come into the veranda and look at the Mall

The two looked down on the now rapidly filling road for all Simla was
abroad to steal a stroll between a shower and a fog

How do you propose to fix that river Look Theres The Mussuckhead
of goodness knows what He is a power in the land though he does eat
like a costermonger Theres Colonel Blone and General Grucher and Sir
Dugald Delane and Sir Henry Haughton and Mr Jellalatty All Heads of
Departments and all powerful

And all my fervent admirers said Mrs Hauksbee piously Sir Henry
Haughton raves about me But go on

One by one these men are worth something Collectively theyre just
a mob of AngloIndians Who cares for what AngloIndians say Your salon
wont weld the Departments together and make you mistress of India
dear And these creatures wont talk administrative shop in a
crowdyour salonbecause they are so afraid of the men in the lower
ranks overhearing it They have forgotten what of Literature and Art
they ever knew and the women

Cant talk about anything except the last Gymkhana or the sins of
their last nurse I was calling on Mrs Derwills this morning

You admit that They can talk to the subalterns though and the
subalterns can talk to them Your salon would suit their views
admirably if you respected the religious prejudices of the country and
provided plenty of kala juggahs

Plenty of kala juggahs Oh my poor little idea Kala juggahs in a
salon But who made you so awfully clever

Perhaps Ive tried myself or perhaps I know a woman who has I have
preached and expounded the whole matter and the conclusion thereof

You neednt go on Is Vanity Polly I thank you These vermin
Mrs Hauksbee waved her hand from the veranda to two men in the crowd
below who had raised their hats to herthese vermin shall not rejoice
in a new Scandal Point or an extra Pelitis I will abandon the notion
of a salon It did seem so tempting though But what shall I do I must
do something

Why Are not Abana and Pharphar

Jack has made you nearly as bad as himself I want to of course Im
tired of everything and everybody from a moonlight picnic at Seepee to
the blandishments of The Mussuck

Yesthat comes too sooner or later Have you nerve enough to make
your bow yet

Mrs Hauksbees mouth shut grimly Then she laughed I think I
see myself doing it Big pink placards on the Mall Mrs Hauksbee
Positively her last appearance on any stage This is to give notice No
more dances no more rides no more luncheons no more theatricals with
supper to follow no more sparring with ones dearest dearest friend
no more fencing with an inconvenient man who hasnt wit enough to clothe
what hes pleased to call his sentiments in passable speech no more
parading of The Mussuck while Mrs Tarkass calls all round Simla
spreading horrible stories about me No more of anything that is
thoroughly wearying abominable and detestable but all the same makes
life worth the having Yes I see it all Dont interrupt Polly
Im inspired A mauve and white striped cloud round my excellent
shoulders a seat in the fifth row of the Gaiety and both horses sold
Delightful vision A comfortable armchair situated in three different
draughts at every ballroom and nice large sensible shoes for all
the couples to stumble over as they go into the veranda Then at
supper Cant you imagine the scene The greedy mob gone away Reluctant
subaltern pink all over like a newlypowdered babythey really ought
to tan subalterns before they are exportedPollysent back by the
hostess to do his duty Slouches up to me across the room tugging at
a glove two sizes too large for himI hate a man who wears gloves like
overcoatsand trying to look as if hed thought of it from the first
May I ahhave the pleasure f takin you nt supper Then I get up
with a hungry smile Just like this

Lucy how can you be so absurd

And sweep out on his arm So After supper I shall go away early you
know because I shall be afraid of catching cold No one will look for
my rickshaw Mine so please you I shall stand always with that mauve
and white cloud over my head while the wet soaks into my dear old
venerable feet and Tom swears and shouts for the memsahibs gharri
Then home to bed at halfpast eleven Truly excellent life helped out
by the visits of the Padri just fresh from burying somebody down
below there She pointed through the pines toward the Cemetery and
continued with vigorous dramatic gestureListen I see it all down
down even to the stays Such stays Sixeight a pair Polly with red
flannelor list is itthat they put into the tops of those fearful
things I can draw you a picture of them

Lucy for Heavens sake dont go waving your arms about in that
idiotic manner Recollect every one can see you from the Mall

Let them see Theyll think I am rehearsing for The Fallen Angel Look
Theres The Mussuck How badly he rides There

She blew a kiss to the venerable Indian administrator with infinite
grace

Now she continued hell be chaffed about that at the Club in the
delicate manner those brutes of men affect and the Hawley Boy will tell
me all about itsoftening the details for fear of shocking me That boy
is too good to live Polly Ive serious thoughts of recommending him to
throw up his Commission and go into the Church In his present frame of
mind he would obey me Happy happy child

Never again said Mrs Mallowe with an affectation of indignation
shall you tiffin here Lucindy your behavior is scandlus

All your fault retorted Mrs Hauksbee for suggesting such a thing
as my abdication No Jamaisnevaire I will act dance ride frivol
talk scandal dine out and appropriate the legitimate captives of any
woman I choose until I drrrop or a better woman than I puts me to
shame before all Simlaand its dust and ashes in my mouth while Im
doing it

She swept into the drawingroom Mrs Mallowe followed and put an arm
round her waist

Im not said Mrs Hauksbee defiantly rummaging for her
handkerchief Ive been dining out the last ten nights and rehearsing
in the afternoon Youd be tired yourself Its only because Im tired

Mrs Mallowe did not offer Mrs Hauksbee any pity or ask her to lie
down but gave her another cup of tea and went on with the talk

Ive been through that too dear she said

I remember said Mrs Hauksbee a gleam of fun on her face In 84
wasnt it You went out a great deal less next season

Mrs Mallowe smiled in a superior and Sphinxlike fashion

I became an Influence said she

Good gracious child you didnt join the Theosophists and kiss
Buddhas big toe did you I tried to get into their set once but they
cast me out for a skepticwithout a chance of improving my poor little
mind too

No I didnt Theosophilander Jack says

Never mind Jack What a husband says is known before What did you do

I made a lasting impression

So have Ifor four months But that didnt console me in the least I
hated the man Will you stop smiling in that inscrutable way and tell me
what you mean

Mrs Mallowe told

     

Andyoumeantosay that it is absolutely Platonic on both sides

Absolutely or I should never have taken it up

And his last promotion was due to you

Mrs Mallowe nodded

And you warned him against the Topsham girl

Another nod

And told him of Sir Dugald Delanes private memo about him

A third nod

Why

What a question to ask a woman Because it amused me at first I am
proud of my property now If I live he shall continue to be successful
Yes I will put him upon the straight road to Knighthood and everything
else that a man values The rest depends upon himself

Polly you are a most extraordinary woman

Not in the least Im concentrated thats all You diffuse yourself
dear and though all Simla knows your skill in managing a team

Cant you choose a prettier word

Team of half a dozen from The Mussuck to the Hawley Boy you gain
nothing by it Not even amusement

And you

Try my recipe Take a man not a boy mind but an almost mature
unattached man and be this guide philosopher and friend Youll find
it the most interesting occupation that you ever embarked on It can be
doneyou neednt look like thatbecause Ive done it

Theres an element of risk about it that makes the notion attractive
Ill get such a man and say to him Now understand that there must be
no flirtation Do exactly what I tell you profit by my instruction and
counsels and all will yet be well as Toole says Is that the idea

More or less said Mrs Mallowe with an unfathomable smile But be
sure he understands that there must be no flirtation


II

 Dribbledribbletrickletrickle
 What a lot of raw dust
 My dollies had an accident
 And out came all the sawdust Nursery Rhyme

So Mrs Hauksbee in The Foundry which overlooks Simla Mall sat at
the feet of Mrs Mallowe and gathered wisdom The end of the Conference
was the Great Idea upon which Mrs Hauksbee so plumed herself

I warn you said Mrs Mallowe beginning to repent of her suggestion
that the matter is not half so easy as it looks Any womaneven the
Topsham girlcan catch a man but very very few know how to manage him
when caught

My child was the answer Ive been a female St Simon Stylites
looking down upon men for thesethese years past Ask The Mussuck
whether I can manage them

Mrs Hauksbee departed humming Ill go to him and say to him in manner
most ironical Mrs Mallowe laughed to herself Then she grew suddenly
sober I wonder whether Ive done well in advising that amusement
Lucys a clever woman but a thought too careless

A week later the two met at a Monday Pop Well said Mrs Mallowe

Ive caught him said Mrs Hauksbee her eyes were dancing with
merriment

Who is it mad woman Im sorry I ever spoke to you about it

Look between the pillars In the third row fourth from the end You
can see his face now Look

Otis Yeere Of all the improbable and impossible people I dont
believe you

Hsh Wait till Mrs Tarkass begins murdering Milton Wellings and Ill
tell you all about it Ssss That womans voice always reminds me of
an Underground train coming into Earls Court with the brakes on Now
listen It is really Otis Yeere

So I see but does it follow that he is your property

He is By right of trove I found him lonely and unbefriended the
very next night after our talk at the Dugald Delanes burrakhana I
liked his eyes and I talked to him Next day he called Next day we
went for a ride together and today hes tied to my rickshawwheels
hand and foot Youll see when the concerts over He doesnt know Im
here yet

Thank goodness you havent chosen a boy What are you going to do with
him assuming that youve got him

Assuming indeed Does a womando Iever make a mistake in that sort
of thing FirstMrs Hauksbee ticked off the items ostentatiously on
her little gloved fingersFirst my dear I shall dress him properly
At present his raiment is a disgrace and he wears a dress shirt like
a crumpled sheet of the Pioneer Secondly after I have made him
presentable I shall form his mannershis morals are above reproach

You seem to have discovered a great deal about him considering the
shortness of your acquaintance

Surely you ought to know that the first proof a man gives of his
interest in a woman is by talking to her about his own sweet self
If the woman listens without yawning he begins to like her If she
flatters the animals vanity he ends by adoring her

In some cases

Never mind the exceptions I know which one you are thinking of
Thirdly and lastly after he is polished and made pretty I shall as
you said be his guide philosopher and friend and he shall become a
successas great a success as your friend I always wondered how
that man got on Did The Mussuck come to you with the Civil List and
dropping on one kneeno two knees a la Gibbonhand it to you and
say Adorable angel choose your friends appointment

Lucy your long experiences of the Military Department have demoralized
you One doesnt do that sort of thing on the Civil Side

No disrespect meant to Jacks Service my dear I only asked for
information Give me three months and see what changes I shall work in
my prey

Go your own way since you must But Im sorry that I was weak enough to
suggest the amusement

I am all discretion and may be trusted to an infinite extent
quoted Mrs Hauksbee from The Fallen Angel and the conversation ceased
with Mrs Tarkasss last longdrawn warwhoop

Her bitterest enemiesand she had manycould hardly accuse Mrs
Hauksbee of wasting her time Otis Yeere was one of those wandering
dumb characters foredoomed through life to be nobodys property Ten
years in Her Majestys Bengal Civil Service spent for the most part
in undesirable Districts had given him little to be proud of and
nothing to bring confidence Old enough to have lost the first
fine careless rapture that showers on the immature Stunt imaginary
Commissionerships and Stars and sends him into the collar with coltish
earnestness and abandon too young to be yet able to look back upon the
progress he had made and thank Providence that under the conditions of
the day he had come even so far he stood upon the deadcentre of his
career And when a man stands still he feels the slightest impulse from
without Fortune had ruled that Otis Yeere should be for the first part
of his service one of the rank and file who are ground up in the wheels
of the Administration losing heart and soul and mind and strength
in the process Until steam replaces manual power in the working of the
Empire there must always be this percentagemust always be the men
who are used up expended in the mere mechanical routine For these
promotion is far off and the millgrind of every day very near and
instant The Secretariats know them only by name they are not the
picked men of the Districts with the Divisions and Collectorates
awaiting them They are simply the rank and filethe food for
feversharing with the ryot and the ploughbullock the honor of being
the plinth on which the State rests The older ones have lost their
aspirations the younger are putting theirs aside with a sigh Both
learn to endure patiently until the end of the day Twelve years in the
rank and file men say will sap the hearts of the bravest and dull the
wits of the most keen

Out of this life Otis Yeere had fled for a few months drifting for the
sake of a little masculine society into Simla When his leave was over
he would return to his swampy sourgreen undermanned district
the native Assistant the native Doctor the native Magistrate the
steaming sweltering Station the illkempt City and the undisguised
insolence of the Municipality that babbled away the lives of men Life
was cheap however The soil spawned humanity as it bred frogs in
the Rains and the gap of the sickness of one season was filled to
overflowing by the fecundity of the next Otis was unfeignedly thankful
to lay down his work for a little while and escape from the seething
whining weakly hive impotent to help itself but strong in its power
to cripple thwart and annoy the wearyeyed man who by official irony
was said to be in charge of it

    

I knew there were womendowdies in Bengal They come up here sometimes
But I didnt know that there were mendowdies too

Then for the first time it occurred to Otis Yeere that his clothes
were rather ancestral in appearance It will be seen from the above that
his friendship with Mrs Hauksbee had made great strides

As that lady truthfully says a man is never so happy as when he is
talking about himself From Otis Yeeres lips Mrs Hauksbee before long
learned everything that she wished to know about the subject of her
experiment learned what manner of life he had led in what she vaguely
called those awful cholera districts learned too but this knowledge
came later what manner of life he had purposed to lead and what dreams
he had dreamed in the year of grace 77 before the reality had knocked
the heart out of him Very pleasant are the shady bridlepaths round
Prospect Hill for the telling of such confidences

Not yet said Mrs Hauksbee to Mrs Mallowe Not yet I must wait
until the man is properly dressed at least Great Heavens is it
possible that he doesnt know what an honor it is to be taken up by Me

Mrs Hauksbee did not reckon false modesty as one of her failings

Always with Mrs Hauksbee murmured Mrs Mallowe with her sweetest
smile to Otis Oh you men you men Here are our Punjabis growling
because youve monopolized the nicest woman in Simla Theyll tear you
to pieces on the Mall some day Mr Yeere

Mrs Mallowe rattled downhill having satisfied herself by a glance
through the fringe of her sunshade of the effect of her words

The shot went home Of a surety Otis Yeere was somebody in this
bewildering whirl of Simlahad monopolized the nicest woman in it and
the Punjabis were growling The notion justified a mild glow of vanity
He had never looked upon his acquaintance with Mrs Hauksbee as a matter
for general interest

The knowledge of envy was a pleasant feeling to the man of no account
It was intensified later in the day when a luncher at the Club said
spitefully Well for a debilitated Ditcher Yeere you are going it
Hasnt any kind friend told you that shes the most dangerous woman in
Simla

Yeere chuckled and passed out When oh when would his new clothes be
ready He descended into the Mall to inquire and Mrs Hauksbee
coming over the Church Ridge in her rickshaw looked down upon him
approvingly Hes learning to carry himself as if he were a man
instead of a piece of furniture andshe screwed up her eyes to see
the better through the sunlighthe is a man when he holds himself like
that Oh blessed Conceit what should we be without you

With the new clothes came a new stock of selfconfidence Otis Yeere
discovered that he could enter a room without breaking into a gentle
perspirationcould cross one even to talk to Mrs Hauksbee as though
rooms were meant to be crossed He was for the first time in nine years
proud of himself and contented with his life satisfied with his new
clothes and rejoicing in the friendship of Mrs Hauksbee

Conceit is what the poor fellow wants she said in confidence to Mrs
Mallowe I believe they must use Civilians to plough the fields with in
Lower Bengal You see I have to begin from the very beginninghavent
I But youll admit wont you dear that he is immensely improved
since I took him in hand Only give me a little more time and he wont
know himself

Indeed Yeere was rapidly beginning to forget what he had been One of
his own rank and file put the matter brutally when he asked Yeere in
reference to nothing And who has been making you a Member of Council
lately You carry the side of half a dozen of em

IIm awfly sorry I didnt mean it you know said Yeere
apologetically

Therell be no holding you continued the old stager grimly Climb
down Otisclimb down and get all that beastly affectation knocked out
of you with fever Three thousand a month wouldnt support it

Yeere repeated the incident to Mrs Hauksbee He had come to look upon
her as his Mother Confessor

And you apologized she said Oh shame I hate a man who apologizes
Never apologize for what your friend called side Never Its a mans
business to be insolent and overbearing until he meets with a stronger
Now you bad boy listen to me

Simply and straightforwardly as the rickshaw loitered round Jakko
Mrs Hauksbee preached to Otis Yeere the Great Gospel of Conceit
illustrating it with living pictures encountered during their Sunday
afternoon stroll

Good gracious she ended with the personal argument youll
apologize next for being my attache

Never said Otis Yeere Thats another thing altogether I shall
always be

Whats coming thought Mrs Hauksbee

Proud of that said Otis

Safe for the present she said to herself

But Im afraid I have grown conceited Like Jeshurun you know When
he waxed fat then he kicked Its the having no worry on ones mind and
the Hill air I suppose

Hill air indeed said Mrs Hauksbee to herself Hed have been
hiding in the Club till the last day of his leave if I hadnt
discovered him And aloudWhy shouldnt you be You have every right
to

I Why

Oh hundreds of things Im not going to waste this lovely afternoon
by explaining but I know you have What was that heap of manuscript you
showed me about the grammar of the aboriginalwhats their names

Gullals A piece of nonsense Ive far too much work to do to bother
over Gullals now You should see my District Come down with your
husband some day and Ill show you round Such a lovely place in the
Rains A sheet of water with the railwayembankment and the snakes
sticking out and in the summer green flies and green squash The
people would die of fear if you shook a dogwhip at em But they know
youre forbidden to do that so they conspire to make your life a burden
to you My Districts worked by some man at Darjiling on the strength
of u native pleaders false reports Oh its a heavenly place

Otis Yeere laughed bitterly

Theres not the least necessity that you should stay in it Why do
you

Because I must Howm I to get out of it

How In a hundred and fifty ways If there werent so many people on
the road Id like to box your ears Ask my dear boy ask Look There
is young Hexarly with six years service and half your talents He asked
for what he wanted and he got it See down by the Convent Theres
McArthurson who has come to his present position by askingsheer
downright askingafter he had pushed himself out of the rank and file
One man is as good as another in your servicebelieve me Ive seen
Simla for more seasons than I care to think about Do you suppose men
are chosen for appointments because of their special fitness beforehand
You have all passed a high testwhat do you call itin the beginning
and except for the few who have gone altogether to the bad you can all
work hard Asking does the rest Call it cheek call it insolence call
it anything you like but ask Men argueyes I know what men saythat
a man by the mere audacity of his request must have some good in him
A weak man doesnt say Give me this and that He whines Why havent
I been given this and that If you were in the Army I should say learn
to spin plates or play a tambourine with your toes As it isask You
belong to a Service that ought to be able to command the Channel Fleet
or set a leg at twenty minutes notice and yet you hesitate over asking
to escape from a squashy green district where you admit you are not
master Drop the Bengal Government altogether Even Darjiling is
a little outoftheway hole I was there once and the rents were
extortionate Assert yourself Get the Government of India to take you
over Try to get on the Frontier where every man has a grand chance
if he can trust himself Go somewhere Do something You have twice the
wits and three times the presence of the men up here and and

Mrs Hauksbee paused for breath then continuedand in any way you
look at it you ought to You who could go so far

I dont know said Yeere rather taken aback by the unexpected
eloquence 1 havent such a good opinion of myself

It was not strictly Platonic but it was Policy Mrs Hauksbee laid
her hand lightly upon the ungloved paw that rested on the turnedback
rickshaw hood and looking the man full in the face said tenderly
almost too tenderly I believe in you if you mistrust yourself Is that
enough my friend

It is enough answered Otis very solemnly

He was silent for a long time redreaming the dreams that he had dreamed
eight years ago but through them all ran as sheetlightning through
golden cloud the light of Mrs Hauksbees violet eyes

Curious and impenetrable are the mazes of Simla lifethe only existence
in this desolate land worth the living Gradually it went abroad among
men and women in the pauses between dance play and Gymkhana that Otis
Yeere the man with the newlylit light of selfconfidence in his eyes
had done something decent in the wilds whence he came He had brought
an erring Municipality to reason appropriated the funds on his own
responsibility and saved the lives of hundreds He knew more about
the Gullals than any living man Had a vast knowledge of the aboriginal
tribes was in spite of his juniority the greatest authority on the
aboriginal Gullals No one quite knew who or what the Gullals were till
The Mussuck who had been calling on Mrs Hauksbee and prided himself
upon picking peoples brains explained they were a tribe of ferocious
hillmen somewhere near Sikkim whose friendship even the Great Indian
Empire would find it worth her while to secure Now we know that Otis
Yeere had showed Mrs Hauksbee his MS notes of six years standing on
the same Gullals He had told her too how sick and shaken with the
fever their negligence had bred crippled by the loss of his pet clerk
and savagely angry at the desolation in his charge he had once damned
the collective eyes of his intelligent local board for a set of
haramzadas Which act of brutal and tyrannous oppression won him
a Reprimand Royal from the Bengal Government but in the anecdote as
amended for Northern consumption we find no record of this Hence we are
forced to conclude that Mrs Hauksbee edited his reminiscences before
sowing them in idle ears ready as she well knew to exaggerate good or
evil And Otis Yeere bore himself as befitted the hero of many tales

You can talk to me when you dont fall into a brown study Talk now
and talk your brightest and best said Mrs Hauksbee

Otis needed no spur Look to a man who has the counsel of a woman of or
above the world to back him So long as he keeps his head he can meet
both sexes on equal groundan advantage never intended by Providence
who fashioned Man on one day and Woman on another in sign that neither
should know more than a very little of the others life Such a man goes
far or the counsel being withdrawn collapses suddenly while his world
seeks the reason

Generalled by Mrs Hauksbee who again had all Mrs Mallowes wisdom
at her disposal proud of himself and in the end believing in himself
because he was believed in Otis Yeere stood ready for any fortune that
might befall certain that it would be good He would fight for his own
hand and intended that this second struggle should lead to better issue
than the first helpless surrender of the bewildered Stunt

What might have happened it is impossible to say This lamentable thing
befell bred directly by a statement of Mrs Hauksbee that she would
spend the next season in Darjiling

Are you certain of that said Otis Yeere

Quite Were writing about a house now

Otis Yeere stopped dead as Mrs Hauksbee put it in discussing the
relapse with Mrs Mallowe

He has behaved she said angrily just like Captain Kerringtons
ponyonly Otis is a donkeyat the last Gymkhana Planted his forefeet
and refused to go on another step Polly my mans going to disappoint
me What shall I do

As a rule Mrs Mallowe does not approve of staring but on this
occasion she opened her eyes to the utmost

You have managed cleverly so far she said Speak to him and ask him
what he means

I willat tonights dance

Noo not at a dance said Mrs Mallowe cautiously Men are never
themselves quite at dances Better wait till tomorrow morning

Nonsense If hes going to revert in this insane way there isnt a day
to lose Are you going No Then sit up for me theres a dear I shant
stay longer than supper under any circumstances

Mrs Mallowe waited through the evening looking long and earnestly into
the fire and sometimes smiling to herself

    

Oh oh oh The mans an idiot A raving positive idiot Im sorry I
ever saw him

Mrs Hauksbee burst into Mrs Mallowes house at midnight almost in
tears

What in the world has happened said Mrs Mallowe but her eyes showed
that she had guessed an answer

Happened Everything has happened He was there I went to him and
said Now what does this nonsense mean Dont laugh dear I cant
bear it But you know what I mean I said Then it was a square and
I sat it out with him and wanted an explanation and he saidOh I
havent patience with such idiots You know what I said about going
to Darjiling next year It doesnt matter to me where I go Id have
changed the Station and lost the rent to have saved this He said in
so many words that he wasnt going to try to work up any more
becausebecause he would be shifted into a province away from
Darjiling and his own District where these creatures are is within a
days journey

Ahhh said Mrs Mallowe in a tone of one who has successfully
tracked an obscure word through a large dictionary

Did you ever hear of anything so madso absurd And he had the ball
at his feet He had only to kick it I would have made him anything
Anything in the wide world He could have gone to the worlds end I
would have helped him I made him didnt I Polly Didnt I create
that man Doesnt he owe everything to me And to reward me just when
everything was nicely arranged by this lunacy that spoiled everything

Very few men understand your devotion thoroughly

Oh Polly dont laugh at me I give men up from this hour I could
have killed him then and there What right had this manthis Thing I
had picked out of his filthy paddyfieldsto make love to me

He did that did he

He did I dont remember half he said I was so angry Oh but such
a funny thing happened I cant help laughing at it now though I felt
nearly ready to cry with rage He raved and I stormedIm afraid we
must have made an awful noise in our kala juggah Protect my character
dear if its all over Simla by tomorrowand then he bobbed forward in
the middle of this insanityI firmly believe the mans dementedand
kissed me

Morals above reproach purred Mrs Mallowe

So they wereso they are It was the most absurd kiss I dont believe
hed ever kissed a woman in his life before I threw my head back and
it was a sort of slidy pecking dab just on the end of the chinhere
Mrs Hauksbee tapped her masculine little chin with her fan Then of
course I was furiously angry and told him that he was no gentleman
and I was sorry Id ever met him and so on He was crushed so easily
that I couldnt be very angry Then I came away straight to you

Was this before or after supper

Oh beforeoceans before Isnt it perfectly disgusting

Let me think I withhold judgment till tomorrow Morning brings
counsel

But morning brought only a servant with a dainty bouquet of Annandale
roses for Mrs Hauksbee to wear at the dance at Viceregal Lodge that
night

He doesnt seem to be very penitent said Mrs Mallowe Whats the
billetdoux in the centre

Mrs Hauksbee opened the neatly folded noteanother accomplishment
that she had taught Otisread it and groaned tragically

Last wreck of a feeble intellect Poetry Is it his own do you think
Oh that I ever built my hopes on such a maudlin idiot

No Its a quotation from Mrs Browning and in view of the facts of
the case as Jack says uncommonly well chosen Listen

 Sweet thou has trod on a heart
 Pass Theres a world full of men
 And women as fair as thou art
 Must do such things now and then

 Thou only hast stepped unaware
 Malice not one can impute
 And why should a heart have been there
 In the way of a fair womans foot

I didntI didntI didnt said Mrs Hauksbee angrily her
eyes filling with tears there was no malice at all Oh its too
vexatious

Youve misunderstood the compliment said Mrs Mallowe He clears
you completely andahemI should think by this that he has cleared
completely too My experience of men is that when they begin to quote
poetry they are going to flit Like swans singing before they die you
know

Polly you take my sorrows in a most unfeeling way

Do I Is it so terrible If hes hurt your vanity I should say that
youve done a certain amount of damage to his heart

Oh you never can tell about a man said Mrs Hauksbee with deep
scorn

    

Reviewing the matter as an impartial outsider it strikes me that Im
about the only person who has profited by the education of Otis Yeere
It comes to twentyseven pages and bittock




AT THE PITS MOUTH

 Men say it was a stolen tide
 The Lord that sent it he knows all
 But in mine ear will aye abide
 The message that the bells let fall
 And awesome bells they were to me
 That in the dark rang Enderby
 Jean Ingelow

Once upon a time there was a man and his Wife and a Tertium Quid

All three were unwise but the Wife was the unwisest The Man should
have looked after his Wife who should have avoided the Tertium Quid
who again should have married a wife of his own after clean and
open flirtations to which nobody can possibly object round Jakko or
Observatory Hill When you see a young man with his pony in a white
lather and his hat on the back of his head flying downhill at fifteen
miles an hour to meet a girl who will be properly surprised to meet
him you naturally approve of that young man and wish him Staff
Appointments and take an interest in his welfare and as the proper
time comes give them sugartongs or sidesaddles according to your
means and generosity

The Tertium Quid flew downhill on horseback but it was to meet the
Mans Wife and when he flew uphill it was for the same end The Man
was in the Plains earning money for his Wife to spend on dresses and
fourhundredrupee bracelets and inexpensive luxuries of that kind He
worked very hard and sent her a letter or a postcard daily She also
wrote to him daily and said that she was longing for him to come up to
Simla The Tertium Quid used to lean over her shoulder and laugh as she
wrote the notes Then the two would ride to the Post Office together

Now Simla is a strange place and its customs are peculiar nor is
any man who has not spent at least ten seasons there qualified to pass
judgment on circumstantial evidence which is the most untrustworthy in
the Courts For these reasons and for others which need not appear
I decline to state positively whether there was anything irretrievably
wrong in the relations between the Mans Wife and the Tertium Quid If
there was and hereon you must form your own opinion it was the Mans
Wifes fault She was kittenish in her manners wearing generally an
air of soft and fluffy innocence But she was deadly learned and
evilinstructed and now and again when the mask dropped men saw
this shuddered and almost drew back Men are occasionally particular
and the least particular men are always the most exacting

Simla is eccentric in its fashion of tearing friendships Certain
attachments which have set and crystallized through half a dozen seasons
acquire almost the sanctity of the marriage bond and are revered as
such Again certain attachments equally old and to all appearance
equally venerable never seem to win any recognized official status
while a chancesprung acquaintance now two months born steps into the
place which by right belongs to the senior There is no law reducible to
print which regulates these affairs

Some people have a gift which secures them infinite toleration and
others have not The Mans Wife had not If she looked over the garden
wall for instance women taxed her with stealing their husbands She
complained pathetically that she was not allowed to choose her own
friends When she put up her big white muff to her lips and gazed over
it and under her eyebrows at you as she said this thing you felt
that she had been infamously misjudged and that all the other womens
instincts were all wrong which was absurd She was not allowed to own
the Tertium Quid in peace and was so strangely constructed that she
would not have enjoyed peace had she been so permitted She preferred
some semblance of intrigue to cloak even her most commonplace actions

After two months of riding first round Jakko then Elysium then Summer
Hill then Observatory Hill then under Jutogh and lastly up and down
the Cart Road as far as the Tara Devi gap in the dusk she said to the
Tertium Quid Frank people say we are too much together and people
are so horrid

The Tertium Quid pulled his moustache and replied that horrid people
were unworthy of the consideration of nice people

But they have done more than talkthey have writtenwritten to my
hubbyIm sure of it said the Mans Wife and she pulled a letter
from her husband out of her saddlepocket and gave it to the Tertium
Quid

It was an honest letter written by an honest man then stewing in the
Plains on two hundred rupees a month for he allowed his wife eight
hundred and fifty and in a silk banian and cotton trousers It is said
that perhaps she had no thought of the unwisdom of allowing her name
to be so generally coupled with the Tertium Quids that she was too
much of a child to understand the dangers of that sort of thing that
he her husband was the last man in the world to interfere jealously
with her little amusements and interests but that it would be better
were she to drop the Tertium Quid quietly and for her husbands sake
The letter was sweetened with many pretty little pet names and it
amused the Tertium Quid considerably He and She laughed over it so
that you fifty yards away could see their shoulders shaking while the
horses slouched along side by side

Their conversation was not worth reporting The upshot of it was that
next day no one saw the Mans Wife and the Tertium Quid together They
had both gone down to the Cemetery which as a rule is only visited
officially by the inhabitants of Simla

A Simla funeral with the clergyman riding the mourners riding and the
coffin creaking as it swings between the bearers is one of the most
depressing things on this earth particularly when the procession passes
under the wet dank dip beneath the Rockcliffe Hotel where the sun is
shut out and all the hill streams are wailing and weeping together as
they go down the valleys

Occasionally folk tend the graves but we in India shift and are
transferred so often that at the end of the second year the Dead have
no friendsonly acquaintances who are far too busy amusing themselves
up the hill to attend to old partners The idea of using a Cemetery as
a rendezvous is distinctly a feminine one A man would have said simply
Let people talk Well go down the Mall A woman is made differently
especially if she be such a woman as the Mans Wife She and the Tertium
Quid enjoyed each others society among the graves of men and women whom
they had known and danced with aforetime

They used to take a big horseblanket and sit on the grass a little to
the left of the lower end where there is a dip in the ground and where
the occupied graves stop short and the readymade ones are not ready
Each wellregulated India Cemetery keeps half a dozen graves permanently
open for contingencies and incidental wear and tear In the Hills these
are more usually babys size because children who come up weakened and
sick from the Plains often succumb to the effects of the Rains in
the Hills or get pneumonia from their ayahs taking them through damp
pinewoods after the sun has set In Cantonments of course the mans
size is more in request these arrangements varying with the climate and
population

One day when the Mans Wife and the Tertium Quid had just arrived in the
Cemetery they saw some coolies breaking ground They had marked out a
fullsize grave and the Tertium Quid asked them whether any Sahib was
sick They said that they did not know but it was an order that they
should dig a Sahibs grave

Work away said the Tertium Quid and lets see how its done

The coolies worked away and the Mans Wife and the Tertium Quid watched
and talked for a couple of hours while the grave was being deepened Then
a coolie taking the earth in blankets as it was thrown up jumped over
the grave

Thats queer said the Tertium Quid Wheres my ulster

Whats queer said the Mans Wife

I have got a chill down my back just as if a goose had walked over my
grave

Why do you look at the thing then said the Mans Wife Let us go

The Tertium Quid stood at the head of the grave and stared without
answering for a space Then he said dropping a pebble down It
is nasty and cold horribly cold I dont think I shall come to the
Cemetery any more I dont think gravedigging is cheerful

The two talked and agreed that the Cemetery was depressing They also
arranged for a ride next day out from the Cemetery through the Mashobra
Tunnel up to Fagoo and back because all the world was going to a
gardenparty at Viceregal Lodge and all the people of Mashobra would go
too

Coming up the Cemetery road the Tertium Quids horse tried to bolt up
hill being tired with standing so long and managed to strain a back
sinew

I shall have to take the mare tomorrow said the Tertium Quid and
she will stand nothing heavier than a snaffle

They made their arrangements to meet in the Cemetery after allowing
all the Mashobra people time to pass into Simla That night it rained
heavily and next day when the Tertium Quid came to the trystingplace
he saw that the new grave had a foot of water in it the ground being a
tough and sour clay

Jove That looks beastly said the Tertium Quid Fancy being boarded
up and dropped into that well

They then started off to Fagoo the mare playing with the snaffle and
picking her way as though she were shod with satin and the sun shining
divinely The road below Mashobra to Fagoo is officially styled the
HimalayanThibet Road but in spite of its name it is not much more than
six feet wide in most places and the drop into the valley below must be
anything between one and two thousand feet

Now were going to Thibet said the Mans Wife merrily as the horses
drew near to Fagoo She was riding on the cliffside

Into Thibet said the Tertium Quid ever so far from people who say
horrid things and hubbies who write stupid letters With youto the
end of the world

A coolie carrying a log of wood came round a corner and the mare went
wide to avoid himforefeet in and haunches out as a sensible mare
should go

To the worlds end said the Mans Wife and looked unspeakable things
over her near shoulder at the Tertium Quid

He was smiling but while she looked the smile froze stiff as it were
on his face and changed to a nervous grinthe sort of grin men wear
when they are not quite easy in their saddles The mare seemed to be
sinking by the stem and her nostrils cracked while she was trying to
realize what was happening The rain of the night before had rotted the
dropside of the HimalayanThibet Road and it was giving way under
her What are you doing said the Mans Wife The Tertium Quid gave no
answer He grinned nervously and set his spurs into the mare who rapped
with her forefeet on the road and the struggle began The Mans Wife
screamed Oh Frank get off

But the Tertium Quid was glued to the saddlehis face blue and
whiteand he looked into the Mans Wifes eyes Then the Mans Wife
clutched at the mares head and caught her by the nose instead of the
bridle The brute threw up her head and went down with a scream the
Tertium Quid upon her and the nervous grin still set on his face

The Mans Wife heard the tinkletinkle of little stones and loose earth
falling off the roadway and the sliding roar of the man and horse going
down Then everything was quiet and she called on Frank to leave his
mare and walk up But Frank did not answer He was underneath the mare
nine hundred feet below spoiling a patch of Indian corn

As the revellers came back from Viceregal Lodge in the mists of the
evening they met a temporarily insane woman on a temporarily mad
horse swinging round the corners with her eyes and her mouth open and
her head like the head of the Medusa She was stopped by a man at the
risk of his life and taken out of the saddle a limp heap and put on
the bank to explain herself This wasted twenty minutes and then she
was sent home in a ladys rickshaw still with her mouth open and her
hands picking at her ridinggloves

She was in bed through the following three days which were rainy so
she missed attending the funeral of the Tertium Quid who was lowered
into eighteen inches of water instead of the twelve to which he had
first objected




A WAYSIDE COMEDY

 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore
 the misery of man is great upon him
 Eccles viii 6

Fate and the Government of India have turned the Station of Kashima into
a prison and because there is no help for the poor souls who are now
lying there in torment I write this story praying that the Government
of India may be moved to scatter the European population to the four
winds

Kashima is bound on all sides by the rocktipped circle of the Dosehri
hills In Spring it is ablaze with roses in Summer the roses die and
the hot winds blow from the hills in Autumn the white mists from
the hills cover the place as with water and in Winter the frosts nip
everything young and tender to earthlevel There is but one view in
Kashimaa stretch of perfectly flat pasture and ploughland running up
to the greyblue scrub of the Dosehri hills

There are no amusements except snipe and tiger shooting but the tigers
have been long since hunted from their lairs in the rockcaves and the
snipe only come once a year Narkarraone hundred and fortythree miles
by roadis the nearest station to Kashima But Kashima never goes
to Narkarra where there are at least twelve English people It stays
within the circle of the Dosehri hills

All Kashima acquits Mrs Vansuythen of any intention to do harm but all
Kashima knows that she and she alone brought about their pain

Boulte the Engineer Mrs Boulte and Captain Kurrell know this They
are the English population of Kashima if we except Major Vansuythen
who is of no importance whatever and Mrs Vansuythen who is the most
important of all

You must remember though you will not understand that all laws weaken
in a small and hidden community where there is no public opinion When
a man is absolutely alone in a Station he runs a certain risk of
falling into evil ways The risk is multiplied by every addition to
the population up to twelvethe Jurynumber After that fear and
consequent restraint begin and human action becomes less grotesquely
jerky

There was deep peace in Kashima till Mrs Vansuythen arrived She was a
charming woman every one said so everywhere and she charmed every
one In spite of this or perhaps because of this since Fate is so
perverse she cared only for one man and he was Major Vansuythen Had
she been plain or stupid this matter would have been intelligible to
Kashima But she was a fair woman with very still grey eyes the color
of a lake just before the light of the sun touches it No man who had
seen those eyes could later on explain what fashion of woman she was
to look upon The eyes dazzled him Her own sex said that she was not
bad looking but spoiled by pretending to be so grave And yet her
gravity was natural It was not her habit to smile She merely went
through life looking at those who passed and the women objected while
the men fell down and worshipped

She knows and is deeply sorry for the evil she has done to Kashima but
Major Vansuythen cannot understand why Mrs Boulte does not drop in
to afternoon tea at least three times a week When there are only two
women in one Station they ought to see a great deal of each other
says Major Vansuythen

Long and long before ever Mrs Vansuythen came out of those faraway
places where there is society and amusement Kurrell had discovered that
Mrs Boulte was the one woman in the world for him andyou dare not
blame them Kashima was as out of the world as Heaven or the Other
Place and the Dosehri hills kept their secret well Boulte had no
concern in the matter He was in camp for a fortnight at a time He was
a hard heavy man and neither Mrs Boulte nor Kurrell pitied him They
had all Kashima and each other for their very very own and Kashima
was the Garden of Eden in those days When Boulte returned from his
wanderings he would slap Kurrell between the shoulders and call him old
fellow and the three would dine together Kashima was happy then when
the judgment of God seemed almost as distant as Narkarra or the railway
that ran down to the sea But the Government sent Major Vansuythen to
Kashima and with him came his wife

The etiquette of Kashima is much the same as that of a desert island
When a stranger is cast away there all hands go down to the shore to
make him welcome Kashima assembled at the masonry platform close to
the Narkarra Road and spread tea for the Vansuythens That ceremony was
reckoned a formal call and made them free of the Station its rights
and privileges When the Vansuythens were settled down they gave a tiny
housewarming to all Kashima and that made Kashima free of their house
according to the immemorial usage of the Station

Then the Rains came when no one could go into camp and the Narkarra
Road was washed away by the Kasun River and in the cuplike pastures
of Kashima the cattle waded kneedeep The clouds dropped down from the
Dosehri hills and covered everything

At the end of the Rains Boultes manner toward his wife changed and
became demonstratively affectionate They had been married twelve years
and the change startled Mrs Boulte who hated her husband with the hate
of a woman who has met with nothing but kindness from her mate and in
the teeth of this kindness had done him a great wrong Moreover
she had her own trouble to fight withher watch to keep over her own
property Kurrell For two months the Rains had hidden the Dosehri hills
and many other things besides but when they lifted they showed Mrs
Boulte that her man among men her Tedfor she called him Ted in the
old days when Boulte was out of earshotwas slipping the links of the
allegiance

The Vansuythen Woman has taken him Mrs Boulte said to herself
and when Boulte was away wept over her belief in the face of the
overvehement blandishments of Ted Sorrow in Kashima is as fortunate
as Love because there is nothing to weaken it save the flight of Time
Mrs Boulte had never breathed her suspicion to Kurrell because she was
not certain and her nature led her to be very certain before she took
steps in any direction That is why she behaved as she did

Boulte came into the house one evening and leaned against the
doorposts of the drawingroom chewing his moustache Mrs Boulte was
putting some flowers into a vase There is a pretence of civilization
even in Kashima

Little woman said Boulte quietly do you care for me

Immensely said she with a laugh Can you ask it

But Im serious said Boulte Do you care for me

Mrs Boulte dropped the flowers and turned round quickly Do you want
an honest answer

Yees Ive asked for it

Mrs Boulte spoke in a low even voice for five minutes very
distinctly that there might be no misunderstanding her meaning When
Samson broke the pillars of Gaza he did a little thing and one not to
be compared to the deliberate pulling down of a womans homestead about
her own ears There was no wise female friend to advise Mrs Boulte
the singularly cautious wife to hold her hand She struck at Boultes
heart because her own was sick with suspicion of Kurrell and worn out
with the long strain of watching alone through the Rains There was
no plan or purpose in her speaking The sentences made themselves and
Boulte listened leaning against the doorpost with his hands in his
pockets When all was over and Mrs Boulte began to breathe through her
nose before breaking out into tears he laughed and stared straight in
front of him at the Dosehri hills

Is that all he said Thanks I only wanted to know you know

What are you going to do said the woman between her sobs

Do Nothing What should I do Kill Kurrell or send you Home or
apply for leave to get a divorce Its two days dak into Narkarra He
laughed again and went on Ill tell you what you can do You can ask
Kurrell to dinner tomorrowno on Thursday that will allow you time to
packand you can bolt with him I give you my word I wont follow

He took up his helmet and went out of the room and Mrs Boulte sat till
the moonlight streaked the floor thinking and thinking and thinking
She had done her best upon the spur of the moment to pull the house
down but it would not fall Moreover she could not understand her
husband and she was afraid Then the folly of her useless truthfulness
struck her and she was ashamed to write to Kurrell saying I have
gone mad and told everything My husband says that I am free to elope
with you Get a dak for Thursday and we will fly after dinner There
was a coldbloodedness about that procedure which did not appeal to her
So she sat still in her own house and thought

At dinnertime Boulte came back from his walk white and worn and
haggard and the woman was touched at his distress As the evening wore
on she muttered some expression of sorrow something approaching to
contrition Boulte came out of a brown study and said Oh that I
wasnt thinking about that By the way what does Kurrell say to the
elopement

I havent seen him said Mrs Boulte Good God is that all

But Boulte was not listening and her sentence ended in a gulp

The next day brought no comfort to Mrs Boulte for Kurrell did not
appear and the new life that she in the five minutes madness of the
previous evening had hoped to build out of the ruins of the old seemed
to be no nearer

Boulte ate his breakfast advised her to see her Arab pony fed in the
veranda and went out The morning wore through and at midday the
tension became unendurable Mrs Boulte could not cry She had finished
her crying in the night and now she did not want to be left alone
Perhaps the Vansuythen woman would talk to her and since talking
opens the heart perhaps there might be some comfort to be found in her
company She was the only other woman in the Station

In Kashima there are no regular callinghours Every one can drop in
upon every one else at pleasure Mrs Boulte put on a big terai hat and
walked across to the Vansuythenss house to borrow last weeks Queen
The two compounds touched and instead of going up the drive she
crossed through the gap in the cactushedge entering the house from
the back As she passed through the diningroom she heard behind
the purdah that cloaked the drawingroom door her husbands voice
sayingBut on my Honor On my Soul and Honor I tell you she doesnt
care for me She told me so last night I would have told you then if
Vansuythen hadnt been with you If it is for her sake that youll have
nothing to say to me you can make your mind easy Its Kurrell

What said Mrs Vansuythen with an hysterical little laugh Kurrell
Oh it cant be You two must have made some horrible mistake Perhaps
youyou lost your temper or misunderstood or something Things cant
be as wrong as you say

Mrs Vansuythen had shifted her defence to avoid the mans pleading and
was desperately trying to keep him to a sideissue

There must be some mistake she insisted and it can be all put right
again

Boulte laughed grimly

It cant be Captain Kurrell He told me that he had never taken the
leastthe least interest in your wife Mr Boulte Oh do listen He
said he had not He swore he had not said Mrs Vansuythen

The purdah rustled and the speech was cut short by the entry of a
little thin woman with big rings round her eyes Mrs Vansuythen stood
up with a gasp

What was that you said asked Mrs Boulte Never mind that man What
did Ted say to you What did he say to you What did he say to you

Mrs Vansuythen sat down helplessly on the sofa overborne by the
trouble of her questioner

He saidI cant remember exactly what he saidbut I understood him
to saythat isBut really Mrs Boulte isnt it rather a strange
question

Will you tell me what he said repeated Mrs Boulte

Even a tiger will fly before a bear robbed of her whelps and Mrs
Vansuythen was only an ordinarily good woman She began in a sort of
desperation Well he said that he never cared for you at all and
of course there was not the least reason why he should have
andandthat was all

You said he swore he had not cared for me Was that true

Yes said Mrs Vansuythen very softly

Mrs Boulte wavered for an instant where she stood and then fell
forward fainting

What did I tell you said Boulte as though the conversation had been
unbroken You can see for yourself she cares for him The light began
to break into his dull mind and he went onAnd hewhat was he saying
to you

But Mrs Vansuythen with no heart for explanations or impassioned
protestations was kneeling over Mrs Boulte

Oh you brute she cried Are all men like this Help me to get her
into my roomand her face is cut against the table Oh will you be
quiet and help me to carry her I hate you and I hate Captain Kurrell
Lift her up carefully and nowgo Go away

Boulte carried his wife into Mrs Vansuythens bedroom and departed
before the storm of that ladys wrath and disgust impenitent
and burning with jealousy Kurrell had been making love to Mrs
Vansuythenwould do Vansuythen as great a wrong as he had done Boulte
who caught himself considering whether Mrs Vansuythen would faint if
she discovered that the man she loved had foresworn her

In the middle of these meditations Kurrell came cantering along the
road and pulled up with a cheery Good mornin Been mashing Mrs
Vansuythen as usual eh Bad thing for a sober married man that What
will Mrs Boulte say

Boulte raised his head and said slowly Oh you liar

Kurrells face changed Whats that he asked quickly

Nothing much said Boulte Has my wife told you that you two are free
to go off whenever you please She has been good enough to explain
the situation to me Youve been a true friend to me Kurrellold
manhavent you

Kurrell groaned and tried to frame some sort of idiotic sentence about
being willing to give satisfaction But his interest in the woman was
dead had died out in the Rains and mentally he was abusing her for
her amazing indiscretion It would have been so easy to have broken off
the thing gently and by degrees and now he was saddled withBoultes
voice recalled him

I dont think I should get any satisfaction from killing you and Im
pretty sure youd get none from killing me

Then in a querulous tone ludicrously disproportioned to his wrongs
Boulte addedSeems rather a pity that you havent the decency to keep
to the woman now youve got her Youve been a true friend to her too
havent you

Kurrell stared long and gravely The situation was getting beyond him

What do you mean he said

Boulte answered more to himself than the questioner My wife came
over to Mrs Vansuythens just now and it seems youd been telling
Mrs Vansuythen that youd never cared for Emma I suppose you lied as
usual What had Mrs Vansuythen to do with you or you with her Try to
speak the truth for once in a way

Kurrell took the double insult without wincing and replied by another
question Go on What happened

Emma fainted said Boulte simply But look here what had you been
saying to Mrs Vansuythen

Kurrell laughed Mrs Boulte had with unbridled tongue made havoc of
his plans and he could at least retaliate by hurting the man in whose
eyes he was humiliated and shown dishonorable

Said to her What does a man tell a lie like that for I suppose I said
pretty much what youve said unless Im a good deal mistaken

I spoke the truth said Boulte again more to himself than Kurrell
Emma told me she hated me She has no right in me

No I suppose not Youre only her husband yknow And what did Mrs
Vansuythen say after you had laid your disengaged heart at her feet

Kurrell felt almost virtuous as he put the question

I dont think that matters Boulte replied and it doesnt concern
you

But it does I tell you it does began Kurrell shamelessly

The sentence was cut by a roar of laughter from Boultes lips Kurrell
was silent for an instant and then he too laughedlaughed long and
loudly rocking in his saddle It was an unpleasant soundthe mirthless
mirth of these men on the long white line of the Narkarra Road There
were no strangers in Kashima or they might have thought that captivity
within the Dosehri hills had driven half the European population mad
The laughter ended abruptly and Kurrell was the first to speak

Well what are you going to do

Boulte looked up the road and at the hills Nothing said he
quietly whats the use Its too ghastly for anything We must let the
old life go on I can only call you a hound and a liar and I cant go
on calling you names forever Besides which I dont feel that Im much
better We cant get out of this place What is there to do

Kurrell looked round the ratpit of Kashima and made no reply The
injured husband took up the wondrous tale

Ride on and speak to Emma if you want to God knows I dont care what
you do

He walked forward and left Kurrell gazing blankly after him Kurrell did
not ride on either to see Mrs Boulte or Mrs Vansuythen He sat in his
saddle and thought while his pony grazed by the roadside

The whir of approaching wheels roused him Mrs Vansuythen was driving
home Mrs Boulte white and wan with a cut on her forehead

Stop please said Mrs Boulte I want to speak to Ted

Mrs Vansuythen obeyed but as Mrs Boulte leaned forward putting her
hand upon the splashboard of the dogcart Kurrell spoke

Ive seen your husband Mrs Boulte

There was no necessity for any further explanation The mans eyes were
fixed not upon Mrs Boulte but her companion Mrs Boulte saw the
look

Speak to him she pleaded turning to the woman at her side Oh
speak to him Tell him what you told me just now Tell him you hate him
Tell him you hate him

She bent forward and wept bitterly while the sais impassive went
forward to hold the horse Mrs Vansuythen turned scarlet and dropped
the reins She wished to be no party to such unholy explanations

Ive nothing to do with it she began coldly but Mrs Boultes sobs
overcame her and she addressed herself to the man I dont know what
I am to say Captain Kurrell I dont know what I can call you I think
youveyouve behaved abominably and she has cut her forehead terribly
against the table

It doesnt hurt It isnt anything said Mrs Boulte feebly That
doesnt matter Tell him what you told me Say you dont care for him
Oh Ted wont you believe her

Mrs Boulte has made me understand that you werethat you were fond of
her once upon a time went on Mrs Vansuythen

Well said Kurrell brutally It seems to me that Mrs Boulte had
better be fond of her own husband first

Stop said Mrs Vansuythen Hear me first I dont careI dont want
to know anything about you and Mrs Boulte but I want you to know that
I hate you that I think you are a cur and that Ill never never speak
to you again Oh I dont dare to say what I think of you youman
_Sais_ gorah _ko_ jane _do_

I want to speak to Ted moaned Mrs Boulte but the dogcart rattled
on and Kurrell was left on the road shamed and boiling with wrath
against Mrs Boulte

He waited till Mrs Vansuythen was driving back to her own house
and she being freed from the embarrassment of Mrs Boultes presence
learned for the second time her opinion of himself and his actions

In the evenings it was the wont of all Kashima to meet at the platform
on the Narkarra Road to drink tea and discuss the trivialities of
the day Major Vansuythen and his wife found themselves alone at the
gatheringplace for almost the first time in their remembrance and
the cheery Major in the teeth of his wifes remarkably reasonable
suggestion that the rest of the Station might be sick insisted upon
driving round to the two bungalows and unearthing the population

Sitting in the twilight said he with great indignation to the
Boultes Thatll never do Hang it all were one family here You must
come out and so must Kurrell Ill make him bring his banjo So great
is the power of honest simplicity and a good digestion over guilty
consciences that all Kashima did turn out even down to the banjo and
the Major embraced the company in one expansive grin As he grinned
Mrs Vansuythen raised her eyes for an instant and looked at all
Kashima Her meaning was clear Major Vansuythen would never know
anything He was to be the outsider in that happy family whose cage was
the Dosehri hills

Youre singing villainously out of tune Kurrell said the Major
truthfully Pass me that banjo

And he sang in excruciatingwise till the stars came out and all Kashima
went to dinner

    

That was the beginning of the New Life of Kashimathe life that Mrs
Boulte made when her tongue was loosened in the twilight

Mrs Vansuythen has never told the Major and since be insists upon
keeping up a burdensome geniality she has been compelled to break her
vow of not speaking to Kurrell This speech which must of necessity
preserve the semblance of politeness and interest serves admirably to
keep alive the flame of jealousy and dull hatred in Boultes bosom as
it awakens the same passions in his wifes heart Mrs Boulte hates
Mrs Vansuythen because she has taken Ted from her and in some curious
fashion hates her because Mrs Vansuythenand here the wifes eyes see
far more clearly than the husbandsdetests Ted And Tedthat gallant
captain and honorable manknows now that it is possible to hate a woman
once loved to the verge of wishing to silence her forever with blows
Above all is he shocked that Mrs Boulte cannot see the error of her
ways

Boulte and he go out tigershooting together in all friendship Boulte
has put their relationship on a most satisfactory footing

Youre a blackguard he says to Kurrell and Ive lost any
selfrespect I may ever have had but when youre with me I can
feel certain that you are not with Mrs Vansuythen or making Emma
miserable

Kurrell endures anything that Boulte may say to him Sometimes they are
away for three days together and then the Major insists upon his
wife going over to sit with Mrs Boulte although Mrs Vansuythen has
repeatedly declared that she prefers her husbands company to any in the
world From the way in which she clings to him she would certainly seem
to be speaking the truth

But of course as the Major says in a little Station we must all be
friendly




THE HILL OF ILLUSION

 What rendered vain their deep desire
 A God a God their severance ruled
 And bade between their shores to be
 The unplumbed salt estranging sea

Shaifazehat

SHE dreamily At Shaifazehat Does the Station go on still That

Amirtollah kutcha road I dont believe that could crumble till the Day
of Judgment

Ha You think so What is the mood now

SHE I cant tell How cold it is Let us get on quickly

Ha Better walk a little Stop your jhampanis and get out Whats the

SHE Nothing You must grow accustomed to my ways If Im boring you

quickly that I couldnt follow Ill apologize in dust and ashes

SHE Therell be enough of those later on Good night Captain
Congleton Going to the singingquadrilles already What dances am I
giving you next week No You must have written them down wrong Five
and Seven I said If youve made a mistake I certainly dont intend to
suffer for it You must alter your programme

HE I thought you told me that you had not been going out much this
season

SHE Quite true but when I do I dance with Captain Congleton He dances
very nicely

HE And sit out with him I suppose

SHE Yes Have you any objection Shall I stand under the chandelier in
future

HE What does he talk to you about

SHE What do men talk about when they sit out

Ha Ugh Dont Well now Im up you must dispense with the fascinating
Congleton for a while I dont like him

SHE after a pause Do you know what you have said

HE Cant say that I do exactly Im not in the best of tempers

SHE So I see and feel My true and faithful lover where is your
eternal constancy unalterable trust and reverent devotion I
remember those phrases you seem to have forgotten them I mention a
mans name

HE A good deal more than that

SHE Well speak to him about a danceperhaps the last dance that I
shall ever dance in my life before I before I go away and you at once
distrust and insult me

HE I never said a word

SHE How much did you imply Guy is this amount of confidence to be our
stock to start the new life on

HE No of course not I didnt mean that On my word of honor I
didnt Let it pass dear Please let it pass

SHE This onceyesand a second time and again and again all through
the years when I shall be unable to resent it You want too much my
Lancelot and you know too much

HE How do you mean

SHE That is a part of the punishment There cannot be perfect trust
between us

HE In Heavens name why not

SHE Hush The Other Place is quite enough Ask yourself

HE I dont follow

SHE You trust me so implicitly that when I look at another manNever
mind Guy Have you ever made love to a girla good girl

HE Something of the sort Centuries agoin the Dark Ages before I
ever met you dear

SHE Tell me what you said to her

HE What does a man say to a girl Ive forgotten

SHE I remember He tells her that he trusts her and worships the ground
she walks on and that hell love and honor and protect her till her
dying day and so she marries in that belief At least I speak of one
girl who was not protected

HE Well and then

SHE And then Guy and then that girl needs ten times the love and
trust and honoryes honorthat was enough when she was only a mere
wife ififthe other life she chooses to lead is to be made even
bearable Do you understand

HE Even bearable Itll he Paradise

SHE Ah Can you give me all Ive asked fornot now nor a few months
later but when you begin to think of what you might have done if you
had kept your own appointment and your caste herewhen you begin to
look upon me as a drag and a burden I shall want it most then Guy
for there will be no one in the wide world but you

HE Youre a little overtired tonight Sweetheart and youre taking a
stage view of the situation After the necessary business in the Courts
the road is clear to

SHE The holy state of matrimony Ha ha ha

HE Ssh Dont laugh in that horrible way

SHE II ccccant help it Isnt it too absurd Ah Ha ha ha Guy
stop me quick or I shalllllaugh till we get to the Church

HE For goodness sake stop Dont make an exhibition of yourself What
is the matter with you

SHE Nnothing Im better now

HE Thats all right One moment dear Theres a little wisp of hair
got loose from behind your right ear and its straggling over your
cheek So

SHE Thankoo Im fraid my hats on one side too

HE What do you wear these huge dagger bonnetskewers for Theyre big
enough to kill a man with

SHE Oh Dont kill me though Youre sticking it into my head Let me
do it You men are so clumsy

HE Have you had many opportunities of comparing usin this sort of
work

SHE Guy what is my name

HE Eh I dont follow

SHE Heres my cardcase Can you read

HE Yes Well

SHE Well that answers your question You know the other mans name Am
I sufficiently humbled or would you like to ask me if there is any one
else

HE I see now My darling I never meant that for an instant I was only
joking There Lucky theres no one on the road Theyd be scandalized

SHE Theyll be more scandalized before the end

HE Doont I dont like you to talk in that way

SHE Unreasonable man Who asked me to face the situation and accept
it Tell me do I look like Mrs Penner Do I look like a naughty woman
Swear I dont Give me your word of honor my honorable friend that Im
not like Mrs Buzgago Thats the way she stands with her hands clasped
at the back of her head Dyou like that

HE Dont be affected

SHE Im not Im Mrs Buzgago Listen

 Pendant une anne toute entiere
 Le regiment na pas rparu
 Au Ministere de la Guerre
 On le rporta comme perdu

 On se rnoncait a rtrouver sa trace
 Quand un matin subitement
 On le vit rparaitre sur la place
 LColonel toujours en avant

Thats the way she rolls her rs Am I like her

HE No but I object when you go on like an actress and sing stuff of
that kind Where in the world did you pick up the Chanson du Colonel It
isnt a drawingroom song It isnt proper

SHE Mrs Buzgago taught it me She is both drawingroom and proper and
in another month shell shut her drawingroom to me and thank God she
isnt as improper as I am Oh Guy Guy I wish I was like some women
and had no scruples aboutwhat is it Keene saysWearing a corpses
hair and being false to the bread they eat

HE I am only a man of limited intelligence and just now very
bewildered When you have quite finished flashing through all your moods
tell me and Ill try to understand the last one

SHE Moods Guy I havent any Im sixteen years old and youre just
twenty and youve been waiting for two hours outside the school in the
cold And now Ive met you and now were walking home together Does
that suit you My Imperial Majesty

HE No We arent children Why cant you be rational

SHE He asks me that when Im going to commit suicide for his sake and
andI dont want to be French and rave about my mother but have I ever
told you that I have a mother and a brother who was my pet before I
married Hes married now Cant you imagine the pleasure that the news
of the elopement will give him Have you any people at Home Guy to be
pleased with your performances

HE One or two One cant make omelets without breaking eggs

SHE slowly I dont see the necessity

HE Hah What do you mean

SHE Shall I speak the truth

HE Under the circumstances perhaps it would be as well

SHE Guy Im afraid

HE I thought wed settled all that What of

SHE Of you

HE Oh damn it all The old business This is too had

SHE Of you

HE And what now

SHE What do you think of me

HE Beside the question altogether What do you intend to do

SHE I darent risk it Im afraid If I could only cheat

HE A la Buzgago No thanks Thats the one point on which I have any
notion of Honor I wont eat his salt and steal too Ill loot openly or
not at all

SHE I never meant anything else

HE Then why in the world do you pretend not to be willing to come

SHE Its not pretence Guy I am afraid

HE Please explain

SHE It cant last Guy It cant last Youll get angry and then
youll swear and then youll get jealous and then youll mistrust
meyou do nowand you yourself will be the best reason for doubting
And Iwhat shall I do I shall be no better than Mrs Buzgago found
outno better than any one And youll know that Oh Guy cant you
see

HE I see that you are desperately unreasonable little woman

SHE There The moment I begin to object you get angry What will you
do when I am only your propertystolen property It cant be Guy It
cant be I thought it could but it cant Youll get tired of me

HE I tell you I shall not Wont anything make you understand that

SHE There cant you see If you speak to me like that now youll call
me horrible names later if I dont do everything as you like And if
you were cruel to me Guy where should I gowhere should I go I cant
trust you Oh I cant trust you

HE I suppose I ought to say that I can trust you Ive ample reason

SHE Please dont dear It hurts as much as if you hit me

HE It isnt exactly pleasant for me

SHE I cant help it I wish I were dead I cant trust you and I dont
trust myself Oh Guy let it die away and be forgotten

HE Too late now I dont understand youI wontand I cant trust
myself to talk this evening May I call tomorrow

SHE Yes No Oh give me time The day after I get into my rickshaw

HE Ill go on to Pelitis too I think I want a drink My worlds
knocked about my ears and the stars are falling Who are those brutes

A SECONDRATE WOMAN

 Est fuga volvitur rota
 On we drift where looms the dim port
 One Two Three Four Five contribute their quota
 Something is gained if one caught but the import
 Show it us Hugues of SaxeGotha

 Master Hugues of SaxeGotha

DRESSED Dont tell me that woman ever dressed in her life She stood
in the middle of her room while her ayahno her husbandit must have
been a manthrew her clothes at her She then did her hair with her
fingers and rubbed her bonnet in the flue under the bed I know she
did as well as if I had assisted at the orgy Who is she said Mrs
Hauksbee

Dont said Mrs Mallowe feebly You make my head ache Im
miserable today Stay me with fondants comfort me with chocolates for
I amDid you bring anything from Pelitis

Questions to begin with You shall have the sweets when you have
answered them Who and what is the creature There were at least half
a dozen men round her and she appeared to be going to sleep in their
midst

Delville said Mrs Mallowe Shady Delville to distinguish her
from Mrs Jim of that ilk She dances as untidily as she dresses I
believe and her husband is somewhere in Madras Go and call if you are
so interested

What have I to do with Shigramitish women She merely caught my
attention for a minute and I wondered at the attraction that a dowd
has for a certain type of man I expected to see her walk out of her
clothesuntil I looked at her eyes

Hooks and eyes surely drawled Mrs Mallowe

Dont be clever Polly You make my head ache And round this hayrick
stood a crowd of mena positive crowd

Perhaps they also expected

Polly dont be Rabelaisian

Mrs Mallowe curled herself up comfortably on the sofa and turned her
attention to the sweets She and Mrs Hauksbee shared the same house
at Simla and these things befell two seasons after the matter of Otis
Yeere which has been already recorded

Mrs Hauksbee stepped into the veranda and looked down upon the Mall
her forehead puckered with thought

Hah said Mrs Hauksbee shortly Indeed

What is it said Mrs Mallowe sleepily

That dowd and The Dancing Masterto whom I object

Why to The Dancing Master He is a middleaged gentleman of reprobate
and romantic tendencies and tries to be a friend of mine

Then make up your mind to lose him Dowds cling by nature and I should
imagine that this animalhow terrible her bonnet looks from aboveis
specially clingsome

She is welcome to The Dancing Master so far as I am concerned I never
could take an interest in a monotonous liar The frustrated aim of his
life is to persuade people that he is a bachelor

0oh I think Ive met that sort of man before And isnt he

No He confided that to me a few days ago Ugh Some men ought to Be
killed

What happened then

He posed as the horror of horrorsa misunderstood man Heaven knows
the femme incomprise is sad enough and had enoughbut the other thing

And so fat too I should have laughed in his face Men seldom confide
in me How is it they come to you

For the sake of impressing me with their careers in the past Protect
me from men with confidences

And yet you encourage them

What can I do They talk I listen and they vow that I am sympathetic
I know I always profess astonishment even when the plot isof the most
old possible

Yes Men are so unblushingly explicit if they are once allowed to talk
whereas womens confidences are full of reservations and fibs except

When they go mad and babble of the Unutterabilities after a weeks
acquaintance Really if you come to consider we know a great deal more
of men than of our own sex

And the extraordinary thing is that men will never believe it They say
we are trying to hide something

They are generally doing that on their own account Alas These
chocolates pall upon me and I havent eaten more than a dozen I think
I shall go to sleep

Then youll get fat dear If you took more exercise and a more
intelligent interest in your neighbors you would

Be as much loved as Mrs Hauksbee Youre a darling in many ways and I
like youyou are not a womans womanbut why do you trouble yourself
about mere human beings

Because in the absence of angels who I am sure would be horribly dull
men and women are the most fascinating things in the whole wide world
lazy one I am interested in The DowdI am interested in The Dancing
MasterI am interested in the Hawley Boyand I am interested in you

Why couple me with the Hawley Boy He is your property

Yes and in his own guileless speech Im making a good thing out
of him When he is slightly more reformed and has passed his Higher
Standard or whatever the authorities think fit to exact from him I
shall select a pretty little girl the Holt girl I think andhere
she waved her hands airilywhom Mrs Hauksbee hath joined together
let no man put asunder Thats all

And when you have yoked May Holt with the most notorious detrimental
in Simla and earned the undying hatred of Mamma Holt what will you do
with me Dispenser of the Destinies of the Universe

Mrs Hauksbee dropped into a low chair in front of the fire and chin
in band gazed long and steadfastly at Mrs Mallowe

I do not know she said shaking her head what I shall do with you
dear Its obviously impossible to marry you to some one elseyour
husband would object and the experiment might not be successful
after all I think I shall begin by preventing you fromwhat is
itsleeping on alehouse benches and snoring in the sun

Dont I dont like your quotations They are so rude Go to the
Library and bring me new books

While you sleep No If you dont come with me I shall spread your
newest frock on my rickshawbow and when any one asks me what I am
doing I shall say that I am going to Phelpss to get it let out I
shall take care that Mrs MacNamara sees me Put your things on theres
a good girl

Mrs Mallowe groaned and obeyed and the two went off to the Library
where they found Mrs Delville and the man who went by the nickname of
The Dancing Master By that time Mrs Mallowe was awake and eloquent

That is the Creature said Mrs Hauksbee with the air of one pointing
out a slug in the road

No said Mrs Mallowe The man is the Creature Ugh Goodevening
Mr Bent I thought you were coming to tea this evening

Surely it was for tomorrow was it not answered The Dancing Master
I understood I fancied Im so sorry How very unfortunate

But Mrs Mallowe had passed on

For the practiced equivocator you said he was murmured Mrs Hauksbee
he strikes me as a failure Now wherefore should he have preferred a
walk with The Dowd to tea with us Elective affinities I supposeboth
grubby Polly Id never forgive that woman as long as the world rolls

I forgive every woman everything said Mrs Mallowe He will be a
sufficient punishment for her What a common voice she has

Mrs Delvilles voice was not pretty her carriage was even less lovely
and her raiment was strikingly neglected All these things Mrs Mallowe
noticed over the top of a magazine

Now what is there in her said Mrs Hauksbee Do you see what I meant
about the clothes falling off If I were a man I would perish sooner
than be seen with that ragbag And yet she has good eyes butoh

What is it

She doesnt know how to use them On my Honor she does not Look Oh
look Untidiness I can endure but ignorance never The womans a fool

Hsh Shell hear you

All the women in Simla are fools Shell think I mean some one else
Now shes going out What a thoroughly objectionable couple she and The
Dancing Master make Which reminds me Do you suppose theyll ever dance
together

Wait and see I dont envy her the conversation of The Dancing
Masterloathly man His wife ought to be up here before long

Do you know anything about him

Only what he told me It may be all a fiction He married a girl bred
in the country I think and being an honorable chivalrous soul told
me that he repented his bargain and sent her to her mother as often as
possiblea person who has lived in the Doon since the memory of man
and goes to Mussoorie when other people go Home The wife is with her at
present So he says

Babies

One only but he talks of his wife in a revolting way I hated him for
it He thought he was being epigrammatic and brilliant

That is a vice peculiar to men I dislike him because he is generally
in the wake of some girl disappointing the Eligibles He will persecute
May Holt no more unless I am much mistaken

No I think Mrs Delville may occupy his attention for a while

Do you suppose she knows that he is the head of a family

Not from his lips He swore me to eternal secrecy Wherefore I tell
you Dont you know that type of man

Not intimately thank goodness As a general rule when a man begins to
abuse his wife to me I find that the Lord gives me wherewith to answer
him according to his folly and we part with a coolness between us I
laugh

Im different Ive no sense of humor

Cultivate it then It has been my mainstay for more years than I care
to think about A welleducated sense of Humor will save a woman when
Religion Training and Home influences fail and we may all need
salvation sometimes

Do you suppose that the Delville woman has humor

Her dress betrays her How can a Thing who wears her supplement under
her left arm have any notion of the fitness of thingsmuch less their
folly If she discards The Dancing Master after having once seen him
dance I may respect her Otherwise

But are we not both assuming a great deal too much dear You saw
the woman at Pelitishalf an hour later you saw her walking with The
Dancing Masteran hour later you met her here at the Library

Still with The Dancing Master remember

Still with The Dancing Master I admit but why on the strength of that
should you imagine

I imagine nothing I have no imagination I am only convinced that The
Dancing Master is attracted to The Dowd because he is objectionable
in every way and she in every other If I know the man as you have
described him he holds his wife in slavery at present

She is twenty years younger than he

Poor wretch And in the end after he has posed and swaggered and
liedhe has a mouth under that ragged moustache simply made for
lieshe will be rewarded according to his merits

I wonder what those really are said Mrs Mallowe

But Mrs Hauksbee her face close to the shelf of the new books was
humming softly What shall he have who killed the Deer She was a lady
of unfettered speech

One month later she announced her intention of calling upon Mrs
Delville Both Mrs Hauksbee and Mrs Mallowe were in morning wrappers
and there was a great peace in the land

I should go as I was said Mrs Mallowe It would be a delicate
compliment to her style

Mrs Hauksbee studied herself in the glass

Assuming for a moment that she ever darkened these doors I should put
on this robe after all the others to show her what a morning
wrapper ought to be It might enliven her As it is I shall go in the
dovecoloredsweet emblem of youth and innocenceand shall put on my
new gloves

If you really are going dirty tan would be too good and you know that
dovecolor spots with the rain

I care not I may make her envious At least I shall try though one
cannot expect very much from a woman who puts a lace tucker into her
habit

Just Heavens When did she do that

Yesterdayriding with The Dancing Master I met them at the back of
Jakko and the rain had made the lace lie down To complete the effect
she was wearing an unclean terai with the elastic under her chin I felt
almost too well content to take the trouble to despise her

The Hawley Boy was riding with you What did he think

Does a boy ever notice these things Should I like him if he did
He stared in the rudest way and just when I thought he had seen the
elastic he said Theres something very taking about that face I
rebuked him on the spot I dont approve of boys being taken by faces

Other than your own I shouldnt be in the least surprised if the
Hawley Boy immediately went to call

I forbade him Let her be satisfied with The Dancing Master and his
wife when she comes up Im rather curious to see Mrs Bent and the
Delville woman together

Mrs Hauksbee departed and at the end of an hour returned slightly
flushed

There is no limit to the treachery of youth I ordered the Hawley
Boy as he valued my patronage not to call The first person I stumble
overliterally stumble overin her poky dark little drawingroom
is of course the Hawley Boy She kept us waiting ten minutes and then
emerged as though he had been tipped out of the dirtyclothes
basket You know my way dear when I am all put out I was Superior
crrrushingly Superior Lifted my eyes to Heaven and had heard
of nothingdropped my eyes on the carpet and really didnt
knowplayed with my cardcase and supposed so The Hawley Boy
giggled like a girl and I had to freeze him with scowls between the
sentences

And she

She sat in a heap on the edge of a couch and managed to convey the
impression that she was suffering from stomachache at the very least
It was all I could do not to ask after her symptoms When I rose she
grunted just like a buffalo in the watertoo lazy to move

Are you certain

Am I blind Polly Laziness sheer laziness nothing elseor her
garments were only constructed for sitting down in I stayed for a
quarter of an hour trying to penetrate the gloom to guess what her
surroundings were like while she stuck out her tongue

Lucy

WellIll withdraw the tongue though Im sure if she didnt do it
when I was in the room she did the minute I was outside At any rate
she lay in a lump and grunted Ask the Hawley Boy dear I believe the
grunts were meant for sentences but she spoke so indistinctly that I
cant swear to it

You are incorrigible simply

I am not Treat me civilly give me peace with honor dont put the
only available seat facing the window and a child may eat jam in my
lap before Church But I resent being grunted at Wouldnt you Do you
suppose that she communicates her views on life and love to The Dancing
Master in a set of modulated Grmphs

You attach too much importance to The Dancing Master

He came as we went and The Dowd grew almost cordial at the sight of
him He smiled greasily and moved about that darkened dogkennel in a
suspiciously familiar way

Dont be uncharitable Any sin but that Ill forgive

Listen to the voice of History I am only describing what I saw He
entered the heap on the sofa revived slightly and the Hawley Boy and
I came away together He is disillusioned but I felt it my duty to
lecture him severely for going there And thats all

Now for Pitys sake leave the wretched creature and The Dancing Master
alone They never did you any harm

No harm To dress as an example and a stumblingblock for half Simla
and then to find this Person who is dressed by the hand of Godnot that
I wish to disparage Him for a moment but you know the tikkadhurzie
way He attires those lilies of the fieldthis Person draws the eyes of
menand some of them nice men Its almost enough to make one discard
clothing I told the Hawley Boy so

And what did that sweet youth do

Turned shellpink and looked across the far blue hills like a
distressed cherub Am I talking wildly Polly Let me say my say and
I shall be calm Otherwise I may go abroad and disturb Simla with a few
original reflections Excepting always your own sweet self there isnt
a single woman in the land who understands me when I amwhats the
word

TeteFelee suggested Mrs Mallowe

Exactly And now let us have tiffin The demands of Society are
exhausting and as Mrs Delville saysHere Mrs Hauksbee to the
horror of the khitmatgars lapsed into a series of grunts while Mrs
Mallowe stared in lazy surprise

God gie us a gude conceit of oorselves said Mrs Hauksbee piously
returning to her natural speech Now in any other woman that would
have been vulgar I am consumed with curiosity to see Mrs Bent I
expect complications

Woman of one idea said Mrs Mallowe shortly all complications are
as old as the hills I have lived through or near allallALL

And yet do not understand that men and women never behave twice alike
I am old who was youngif ever I put my head in your lap you dear big
sceptic you will learn that my parting is gauzebut never no never
have I lost my interest in men and women Polly I shall see this
business Out to the bitter end

I am going to sleep said Mrs Mallowe calmly I never interfere
with men or women unless I am compelled and she retired with dignity
to her own room

Mrs Hauksbees curiosity was not long left ungratified for Mrs Bent
came up to Simla a few days after the conversation faithfully reported
above and pervaded the Mall by her husbands side

Behold said Mrs Hauksbee thoughtfully rubbing her nose That is
the last link of the chain if we omit the husband of the Delville
whoever he may be Let me consider The Bents and the Delvilles inhabit
the same hotel and the Delville is detested by the Waddydo you know
the Waddywho is almost as big a dowd The Waddy also abominates the
male Bent for which if her other sins do not weigh too heavily she
will eventually be caught up to Heaven

Dont be irreverent said Mrs Mallowe I like Mrs Bents face

I am discussing the Waddy returned Mrs Hauksbee loftily The Waddy
will take the female Bent apart after having borrowedyeseverything
that she can from hairpins to babies bottles Such my dear is life
in a hotel The Waddy will tell the female Bent facts and fictions about
The Dancing Master and The Dowd

Lucy I should like you better if you were not always looking into
peoples back bedrooms

Anybody can look into their front drawingrooms and remember whatever
I do and whatever I look I never talkas the Waddy will Let us hope
that The Dancing Masters greasy smile and manner of the pedagogue will
soften the heart of that cow his wife If mouths speak truth I should
think that little Mrs Bent could get very angry on occasion

But what reason has she for being angry

What reason The Dancing Master in himself is a reason How does it go
If in his life some trivial errors fall Look in his face and youll
believe them all I am prepared to credit any evil of The Dancing
Master because I hate him so And The Dowd is so disgustingly badly
dressed

That she too is capable of every iniquity I always prefer to believe
the best of everybody It saves so much trouble

Very good I prefer to believe the worst It saves useless expenditure
of sympathy And you may be quite certain that the Waddy believes with
me

Mrs Mallowe sighed and made no answer

The conversation was holden after dinner while Mrs Hauksbee was
dressing for a dance

I am too tired to go pleaded Mrs Mallowe and Mrs Hauksbee left
her in peace till two in the morning when she was aware of emphatic
knocking at her door

Dont be very angry dear said Mrs Hauksbee My idiot of an ayah
has gone home and as I hope to sleep tonight there isnt a soul in
the place to unlace me

Oh this is too bad said Mrs Mallowe sulkily

Cant help it Im a lone lorn grasswidow dear but I will not
sleep in my stays And such news too Oh do unlace me theres a
darling The DowdThe Dancing MasterI and the Hawley BoyYou know
the North veranda

How can I do anything if you spin round like this protested Mrs
Mallowe fumbling with the knot of the laces

Oh I forget I must tell my tale without the aid of your eyes Do you
know youve lovely eyes dear Well to begin with I took the Hawley Boy
to a kala juggah

Did he want much taking

Lots There was an arrangement of looseboxes in kanats and she was in
the next one talking to him

Which How Explain

You know what I meanThe Dowd and The Dancing Master We could hear
every word and we listened shamelesslyspecially the Hawley Boy
Polly I quite love that woman

This is interesting There Now turn round What happened

One moment Ahh Blessed relief Ive been looking forward to taking
them off for the last halfhourwhich is ominous at my time of life
But as I was saying we listened and heard The Dowd drawl worse
than ever She drops her final gs like a barmaid or a blueblooded
AidedeCamp Look heere youre gettin too fond 0 me she said
and The Dancing Master owned it was so in language that nearly made
me ill The Dowd reflected for a while Then we heard her say Look
heere Mister Bent why are you such an awful liar I nearly exploded
while The Dancing Master denied the charge It seems that he never told
her he was a married man

I said he wouldnt

And she had taken this to heart on personal grounds I suppose She
drawled along for five minutes reproaching him with his perfidy and
grew quite motherly Now youve got a nice little wife of your ownyou
have she said Shes ten times too good for a fat old man like you
and look heere you never told me a word about her and Ive been
thinkin about it a good deal and I think youre a liar Wasnt that
delicious The Dancing Master maundered and raved till the Hawley Boy
suggested that he should burst in and beat him His voice runs up
into an impassioned squeak when he is afraid The Dowd must be an
extraordinary woman She explained that had he been a bachelor she might
not have objected to his devotion but since he was a married man and
the father of a very nice baby she considered him a hypocrite and this
she repeated twice She wound up her drawl with An Im tellin you
this because your wife is angry with me an I hate quarrellin with any
other woman an I like your wife You know how you have behaved for the
last six weeks You shouldnt have done it indeed you shouldnt Youre
too old an fat Cant you imagine how The Dancing Master would wince
at that Now go away she said I dont want to tell you what I think
of you because I think you are not nice Ill stay heere till the next
dance begins Did you think that the creature had so much in her

I never studied her as closely as you did It sounds unnatural What
happened

The Dancing Master attempted blandishment reproof jocularity and the
style of the Lord High Warden and I had almost to pinch the Hawley Boy
to make him keep quiet She grunted at the end of each sentence and in
the end he went away swearing to himself quite like a man in a novel
He looked more objectionable than ever I laughed I love that womanin
spite of her clothes And now Im going to bed What do you think of
it

I shant begin to think till the morning said Mrs Mallowe
yawning Perhaps she spoke the truth They do fly into it by accident
sometimes

Mrs Hauksbees account of her eavesdropping was an ornate one but
truthful in the main For reasons best known to herself Mrs Shady
Delville had turned upon Mr Bent and rent him limb from limb casting
him away limp and disconcerted ere she withdrew the light of her eyes
from him permanently Being a man of resource and anything but pleased
in that he had been called both old and fat he gave Mrs Bent to
understand that he had during her absence in the Doon been the victim
of unceasing persecution at the hands of Mrs Delville and he told the
tale so often and with such eloquence that he ended in believing it
while his wife marvelled at the manners and customs of some women
When the situation showed signs of languishing Mrs Waddy was always on
hand to wake the smouldering fires of suspicion in Mrs Bents bosom
and to contribute generally to the peace and comfort of the hotel Mr
Bents life was not a happy one for if Mrs Waddys story were true
he was argued his wife untrustworthy to the last degree If his own
statement was true his charms of manner and conversation were so
great that he needed constant surveillance And he received it till
he repented genuinely of his marriage and neglected his personal
appearance Mrs Delville alone in the hotel was unchanged She removed
her chair some six paces toward the head of the table and occasionally
in the twilight ventured on timid overtures of friendship to Mrs Bent
which were repulsed

She does it for my sake hinted the Virtuous Bent

A dangerous and designing woman purred Mrs Waddy

Worst of all every other hotel in Simla was full

    

Polly are you afraid of diphtheria

Of nothing in the world except smallpox Diphtheria kills but it
doesnt disfigure Why do you ask

Because the Bent baby has got it and the whole hotel is upside down
in consequence The Waddy has set her five young on the rail and fled
The Dancing Master fears for his precious throat and that miserable
little woman his wife has no notion of what ought to be done She
wanted to put it into a mustard bathfor croup

Where did you learn all this

Just now on the Mall Dr Howlen told me The Manager of the hotel
is abusing the Bents and the Bents are abusing the manager They are a
feckless couple

Well Whats on your mind

This and I know its a grave thing to ask Would you seriously object
to my bringing the child over here with its mother

On the most strict understanding that we see nothing of The Dancing
Master

He will be only too glad to stay away Polly youre an angel The
woman really is at her wits end

And you know nothing about her careless and would hold her up to
public scorn if it gave you a minutes amusement Therefore you risk
your life for the sake of her brat No Loo Im not the angel I shall
keep to my rooms and avoid her But do as you pleaseonly tell me why
you do it

Mrs Hauksbees eyes softened she looked out of the window and back
into Mrs Mallowes face

I dont know said Mrs Hauksbee simply

You dear

Pollyand for aught you knew you might have taken my fringe off
Never do that again without warning Now well get the rooms ready I
dont suppose I shall be allowed to circulate in society for a month

And I also Thank goodness I shall at last get all the sleep I want

Much to Mrs Bents surprise she and the baby were brought over to
the house almost before she knew where she was Bent was devoutly and
undisguisedly thankful for he was afraid of the infection and also
hoped that a few weeks in the hotel alone with Mrs Delville might lead
to explanations Mrs Bent had thrown her jealousy to the winds in her
fear for her childs life

We can give you good milk said Mrs Hauksbee to her and our house
is much nearer to the Doctors than the hotel and you wont feel as
though you were living in a hostile camp Where is the dear Mrs Waddy
She seemed to be a particular friend of yours

Theyve all left me said Mrs Bent bitterly Mrs Waddy went first
She said I ought to be ashamed of myself for introducing diseases there
and I am sure it wasnt my fault that little Dora

How nice cooed Mrs Hauksbee The Waddy is an infectious disease
herselfmore quickly caught than the plague and the taker runs
presently mad I lived next door to her at the Elysium three years
ago Now see you wont give us the least trouble and Ive ornamented
all the house with sheets soaked in carbolic It smells comforting
doesnt it Remember Im always in call and my ayahs at your service
when yours goes to her meals andand if you cry Ill never forgive
you

Dora Bent occupied her mothers unprofitable attention through the day
and the night The Doctor called thrice in the twentyfour hours and
the house reeked with the smell of the Condys Fluid chlorinewater
and carbolic acid washes Mrs Mallowe kept to her own roomsshe
considered that she had made sufficient concessions in the cause of
humanityand Mrs Hauksbee was more esteemed by the Doctor as a help in
the sickroom than the halfdistraught mother

I know nothing of illness said Mrs Hauksbee to the Doctor Only
tell me what to do and Ill do it

Keep that crazy woman from kissing the child and let her have as
little to do with the nursing as you possibly can said the Doctor
Id turn her out of the sickroom but that I honestly believe shed
die of anxiety She is less than no good and I depend on you and the
ayahs remember

Mrs Hauksbee accepted the responsibility though it painted olive
hollows under her eyes and forced her to her oldest dresses Mrs Bent
clung to her with more than childlike faith

I know youll make Dora well wont you she said at least twenty
times a day and twenty times a day Mrs Hauksbee answered valiantly
Of course I will

But Dora did not improve and the Doctor seemed to be always in the
house

Theres some danger of the thing taking a bad turn he said Ill
come over between three and four in the morning tomorrow

Good gracious said Mrs Hauksbee He never told me what the turn
would be My education has been horribly neglected and I have only this
foolish motherwoman to fall back upon

The night wore through slowly and Mrs Hauksbee dozed in a chair by the
fire There was a dance at the Viceregal Lodge and she dreamed of it
till she was aware of Mrs Bents anxious eyes staring into her own

Wake up Wake up Do something cried Mrs Bent piteously Doras
choking to death Do you mean to let her die

Mrs Hauksbee jumped to her feet and bent over the bed The child was
fighting for breath while the mother wrung her hands despairing

Oh what can I do What can you do She wont stay still I cant hold
her Why didnt the Doctor say this was coming screamed Mrs Bent
Wont you help me Shes dying

IIve never seen a child die before stammered Mrs Hauksbee
feebly and thenlet none blame her weakness after the strain of long
watchingshe broke down and covered her face with her hands The ayahs
on the threshold snored peacefully

There was a rattle of rickshaw wheels below the clash of an opening
door a heavy step on the stairs and Mrs Delville entered to find Mrs
Bent screaming for the Doctor as she ran round the room Mrs Hauksbee
her hands to her ears and her face buried in the chintz of a chair was
quivering with pain at each cry from the bed and murmuring Thank God
I never bore a child Oh thank God I never bore a child

Mrs Delville looked at the bed for an instant took Mrs Bent by the
shoulders and said quietly Get me some caustic Be quick

The mother obeyed mechanically Mrs Delville had thrown herself down by
the side of the child and was opening its mouth

Oh youre killing her cried Mrs Bent Wheres the Doctor Leave
her alone

Mrs Delville made no reply for a minute but busied herself with the
child

Now the caustic and hold a lamp behind my shoulder Will you do as you
are told The acidbottle if you dont know what I mean she said

A second time Mrs Delville bent over the child Mrs Hauksbee her face
still hidden sobbed and shivered One of the ayahs staggered sleepily
into the room yawning Doctor Sahib come

Mrs Delville turned her head

Youre only just in time she said It was chokin her when I came
in an Ive burned it

There was no sign of the membrane getting to the airpassages after the
last steaming It was the general weakness I feared said the Doctor
half to himself and he whispered as he looked Youve done what I
should have been afraid to do without consultation

She was dyin said Mrs Delville under her breath Can you do
anythin What a mercy it was I went to the dance

Mrs Hauksbee raised her head

Is it all over she gasped Im uselessIm worse than useless What
are you doing here

She stared at Mrs Delville and Mrs Bent realizing for the first time
who was the Goddess from the Machine stared also

Then Mrs Delville made explanation putting on a dirty long glove and
smoothing a crumpled and illfitting balldress

I was at the dance an the Doctor was tellin me about your baby bein
so ill So I came away early an your door was open an II lost my
boy this way six months ago an Ive been tryin to forget it ever
since an IIIam very sorry for intrudin an anythin that has
happened

Mrs Bent was putting out the Doctors eye with a lamp as he stooped
over Dora

Take it away said the Doctor I think the child will do thanks to
you Mrs Delville I should have come too late but I assure youhe
was addressing himself to Mrs DelvilleI had not the faintest reason
to expect this The membrane must have grown like a mushroom Will one
of you help me please

He had reason for the last sentence Mrs Hauksbee had thrown herself
into Mrs Delvilles arms where she was weeping bitterly and Mrs Bent
was unpicturesquely mixed up with both while from the tangle came the
sound of many sobs and much promiscuous kissing

Good gracious Ive spoilt all your beautiful roses said Mrs
Hauksbee lifting her head from the lump of crushed gum and calico
atrocities on Mrs Delvilles shoulder and hurrying to the Doctor

Mrs Delville picked up her shawl and slouched out of the room mopping
her eyes with the glove that she had not put on

I always said she was more than a woman sobbed Mrs Hauksbee
hysterically and that proves it

    

Six weeks later Mrs Bent and Dora had returned to the hotel Mrs
Hauksbee had come out of the Valley of Humiliation had ceased to
reproach herself for her collapse in an hour of need and was even
beginning to direct the affairs of the world as before

So nobody died and everything went off as it should and I kissed The
Dowd Polly I feel so old Does it show in my face

Kisses dont as a rule do they Of course you know what the result of
The Dowds providential arrival has been

They ought to build her a statueonly no sculptor dare copy those
skirts

Ah said Mrs Mallowe quietly She has found another reward The
Dancing Master has been smirking through Simla giving every one to
understand that she came because of her undying love for himfor
himto save his child and all Simla naturally believes this

But Mrs Bent

Mrs Bent believes it more than any one else She wont speak to The
Dowd now Isnt The Dancing Master an angel

Mrs Hauksbee lifted up her voice and raged till bedtime The doors of
the two rooms stood open

Polly said a voice from the darkness what did that
Americanheiressglobetrottergirl say last season when she was tipped
out of her rickshaw turning a corner Some absurd adjective that made
the man who picked her up explode

Paltry said Mrs Mallowe Through her noselike thisHaow
pahltry

Exactly said the voice Haow pahltry it all is

Which

Everything Babies Diphtheria Mrs Bent and The Dancing Master I
whooping in a chair and The Dowd dropping in from the clouds I wonder
what the motive wasall the motives

Um

What do you think

Dont ask me She was a woman Go to sleep

    




ONLY A SUBALTERN

  Not only to enforce by command but to encourage by
 example the energetic discharge of duty and the steady
 endurance of the difficulties and privations inseparable
 from Military Service Bengal Army Regulations

THEY made Bobby Wick pass an examination at Sandhurst He was a
gentleman before he was gazetted so when the Empress announced that
GentlemanCadet Robert Hanna Wick was posted as Second Lieutenant to
the Tyneside Tail Twisters at Kram Bokhar he became an officer and a
gentleman which is an enviable thing and there was joy in the house of
Wick where Mamma Wick and all the little Wicks fell upon their knees and
offered incense to Bobby by virtue of his achievements

Papa Wick had been a Commissioner in his day holding authority over
three millions of men in the ChotaBuldana Division building great
works for the good of the land and doing his best to make two blades
of grass grow where there was but one before Of course nobody knew
anything about this in the little English village where he was just old
Mr Wick and had forgotten that he was a Companion of the Order of the
Star of India

He patted Bobby on the shoulder and said Well done my boy

There followed while the uniform was being prepared an interval of
pure delight during which Bobby took brevetrank as a man at the
womenswamped tennisparties and teafights of the village and I dare
say had his joiningtime been extended would have fallen in love with
several girls at once Little country villages at Home are very full of
nice girls because all the young men come out to India to make their
fortunes

India said Papa Wick is the place Ive had thirty years of it and
begad Id like to go back again When you join the Tail Twisters youll
be among friends if every one hasnt forgotten Wick of ChotaBuldana
and a lot of people will be kind to you for our sakes The mother will
tell you more about outfit than I can but remember this Stick to your
Regiment Bobbystick to your Regiment Youll see men all round you
going into the Staff Corps and doing every possible sort of duty but
regimental and you may be tempted to follow suit Now so long as you
keep within your allowance and I havent stinted you there stick to
the Line the whole Line and nothing but the Line Be careful how you
back another young fools bill and if you fall in love with a woman
twenty years older than yourself dont tell me about it thats all

With these counsels and many others equally valuable did Papa Wick
fortify Bobby ere that last awful night at Portsmouth when the Officers
Quarters held more inmates than were provided for by the Regulations
and the libertymen of the ships fell foul of the drafts for India and
the battle raged from the Dockyard Gates even to the slums of Longport
while the drabs of Fratton came down and scratched the faces of the
Queens Officers

Bobby Wick with an ugly bruise on his freckled nose a sick and shaky
detachment to manoeuvre inship and the comfort of fifty scornful females
to attend to had no time to feel homesick till the Malabar reached
midChannel when he doubled his emotions with a little guardvisiting
and a great many other matters

The Tail Twisters were a most particular Regiment Those who knew them
least said that they were eaten up with side But their reserve and
their internal arrangements generally were merely protective diplomacy
Some five years before the Colonel commanding had looked into the
fourteen fearless eyes of seven plump and juicy subalterns who had all
applied to enter the Staff Corps and had asked them why the three
stars should he a colonel of the Line command a dashed nursery for
doubledashed bottlesuckers who put on condemned tin spurs and rode
qualified mokes at the hiatused heads of forsaken Black Regiments He
was a rude man and a terrible Wherefore the remnant took measures with
the halfbutt as an engine of public opinion till the rumor went abroad
that young men who used the Tail Twisters as a crutch to the Staff
Corps had many and varied trials to endure However a regiment had just
as much right to its own secrets as a woman

When Bobby came up from Deolali and took his place among the Tail
Twisters it was gently But firmly borne in upon him that the Regiment
was his father and his mother and his indissolubly wedded wife and
that there was no crime under the canopy of heaven blacker than that
of bringing shame on the Regiment which was the bestshooting
bestdrilled bestsetup bravest most illustrious and in all
respects most desirable Regiment within the compass of the Seven Seas
He was taught the legends of the Mess Plate from the great grinning
Golden Gods that had come out of the Summer Palace in Pekin to the
silvermounted markhorhorn snuffmull presented by the last C 0 he
who spake to the seven subalterns And every one of those legends told
him of battles fought at long odds without fear as without support of
hospitality catholic as an Arabs of friendships deep as the sea and
steady as the fightingline of honor won by hard roads for honors
sake and of instant and unquestioning devotion to the Regimentthe
Regiment that claims the lives of all and lives forever

More than once too he came officially into contact with the Regimental
colors which looked like the lining of a bricklayers hat on the end
of a chewed stick Bobby did not kneel and worship them because British
subalterns are not constructed in that manner Indeed he condemned them
for their weight at the very moment that they were filling with awe and
other more noble sentiments

But best of all was the occasion when he moved with the Tail Twisters
in review order at the breaking of a November day Allowing for dutymen
and sick the Regiment was one thousand and eighty strong and Bobby
belonged to them for was he not a Subaltern of the Line the whole Line
and nothing but the Lineas the tramp of two thousand one hundred and
sixty sturdy ammunition boots attested He would not have changed places
with Deighton of the Horse Battery whirling by in a pillar of cloud
to a chorus of Strong right Strong left or HoganYale of the White
Hussars leading his squadron for all it was worth with the price of
horseshoes thrown in or Tick Boileau trying to live up to his fierce
blue and gold turban while the wasps of the Bengal Cavalry stretched
to a gallop in the wake of the long lollopping Walers of the White
Hussars

They fought through the clear cool day and Bobby felt a little thrill
run down his spine when he heard the tinkletinkletinkle of the empty
cartridgecases hopping from the breechblocks after the roar of the
volleys for he knew that he should live to hear that sound in action
The review ended in a glorious chase across the plainbatteries
thundering after cavalry to the huge disgust of the White Hussars and
the Tyneside Tail Twisters hunting a Sikh Regiment till the lean lathy
Singhs panted with exhaustion Bobby was dusty and dripping long before
noon but his enthusiasm was merely focusednot diminished

He returned to sit at the feet of Revere his skipper that is to say
the Captain of his Company and to be instructed in the dark art and
mystery of managing men which is a very large part of the Profession of
Arms

If you havent a taste that way said Revere between his puffs of
his cheroot youll never be able to get the hang of it but remember
Bobby tisnt the best drill though drill is nearly everything that
hauls a Regiment through Hell and out on the other side Its the man
who knows how to handle mengoatmen swinemen dogmen and so on

Dormer for instance said Bobby I think he comes under the head of
foolmen He mopes like a sick owl

Thats where you make your mistake my son Dormer isnt a fool yet
but hes a dashed dirty soldier and his room corporal makes fun of his
socks before kitinspection Dormer being twothirds pure brute goes
into a corner and growls

How do you know said Bobby admiringly

Because a Company commander has to know these thingsbecause if he
does not know he may have crimeay murderbrewing under his very
nose and yet not see that its there Dormer is being badgered out of
his mindbig as he isand he hasnt intellect enough to resent it
Hes taken to quiet boozing and Bobby when the butt of a room goes on
the drink or takes to moping by himself measures are necessary to pull
him out of himself

What measures Man cant run round coddling his men forever

No The men would precious soon show him that he was not wanted
Youve got toHere the Colorsergeant entered with some papers Bobby
reflected for a while as Revere looked through the Company forms

Does Dormer do anything Sergeant Bobby asked with the air of one
continuing an interrupted conversation

No sir Does is dooty like a hortomato said the Sergeant who
delighted in long words A dirty soldier and es under full stoppages
for new kit Its covered with scales sir

Scales What scales

Fishscales sir Es always pokin in the mud by the river an
acleanin them muchlyfish with is thumbs Revere was still absorbed
in the Company papers and the Sergeant who was sternly fond of Bobby
continuedE generally goes down there when es got is skinful
beggin your pardon sir an they do say that the more lush
inhebriated e is the more fish e catches They call im the Looney
Fishmonger in the Compny sir

Revere signed the last paper and the Sergeant retreated

Its a filthy amusement sighed Bobby to himself Then aloud to
Revere Are you really worried about Dormer

A little You see hes never mad enough to send to a hospital or
drunk enough to run in but at any minute he may flare up brooding and
sulking as he does He resents any interest being shown in him and the
only time I took him out shooting he all but shot me by accident

I fish said Bobby with a wry face I hire a countryboat and go
down the river from Thursday to Sunday and the amiable Dormer goes with
meif you can spare us both

You blazing young fool said Revere but his heart was full of much
more pleasant words

Bobby the Captain of a dhoni with Private Dormer for mate dropped
down the river on Thursday morningthe Private at the bow the
Subaltern at the helm The Private glared uneasily at the Subaltern who
respected the reserve of the Private

After six hours Dormer paced to the stern saluted and saidBeg
ypardon sir but was you ever on the Durhm Canal

No said Bobby Wick Come and have some tiffin

They ate in silence As the evening fell Private Dormer broke forth
speaking to himselfHi was on the Durhm Canal jes such a night
come next week twelve month atrailin of my toes in the water He
smoked and said no more till bedtime

The witchery of the dawn turned the grey riverreaches to purple gold
and opal and it was as though the lumbering dhoni crept across the
splendors of a new heaven

Private Dormer popped his head out of his blanket and gazed at the glory
below and around

Welldamnmyeyes said Private Dormer in an awed whisper This
ere is like a bloomin gallantryshow For the rest of the day he was
dumb but achieved an ensanguined filthiness through the cleaning of big
fish

The boat returned on Saturday evening Dormer had been struggling with
speech since noon As the lines and luggage were being disembarked he
found tongue

Beg ypardonsir he said but would youwould you min shakin
ands with me sir

Of course not said Bobby and he shook accordingly Dormer returned
to barracks and Bobby to mess

He wanted a little quiet and some fishing I think said Bobby My
aunt but hes a filthy sort of animal Have you ever seen him clean
them muchlyfish with is thumbs

Anyhow said Revere three weeks later hes doing his best to keep
his things clean

When the spring died Bobby joined in the general scramble for Hill
leave and to his surprise and delight secured three months

As good a boy as I want said Revere the admiring skipper

The best of the batch said the Adjutant to the Colonel Keep back
that young skrimshanker Porkiss sir and let Revere make him sit up

So Bobby departed joyously to Simla Pahar with a tin box of gorgeous
raiment

Son of Wickold Wick of ChotaBuldana Ask him to dinner dear said
the aged men

What a nice boy said the matrons and the maids

Firstclass place Simla Oh riipping said Bobby Wick and ordered
new white cord breeches on the strength of it

Were in a bad way wrote Revere to Bobby at the end of two months
Since you left the Regiment has taken to fever and is fairly rotten
with ittwo hundred in hospital about a hundred in cellsdrinking to
keep off feverand the Companies on parade fifteen file strong at the
outside Theres rather more sickness in the outvillages than I care
for but then Im so blistered with pricklyheat that Im ready to hang
myself Whats the yarn about your mashing a Miss Haverley up there Not
serious I hope Youre overyoung to hang millstones round your neck
and the Colonel will turf you out of that in doublequick time if you
attempt it

It was not the Colonel that brought Bobby out of Simla but a much more
to be respected Commandant The sick ness in the outvillages spread
the Bazar was put out of bounds and then came the news that the
Tail Twisters must go into camp The message flashed to the Hill
stationsCholeraLeave stoppedOfficers recalled Alas for the
white gloves in the neatly soldered boxes the rides and the dances and
picnics that were to he the loves half spoken and the debts unpaid
Without demur and without question fast as tongue could fly or pony
gallop back to their Regiments and their Batteries as though they were
hastening to their weddings fled the subalterns

Bobby received his orders on returning from a dance at Viceregal Lodge
where he hadbut only the Haverley girl knows what Bobby had said or
how many waltzes he had claimed for the next ball Six in the morning
saw Bobby at the Tonga Office in the drenching rain the whirl of the
last waltz still in his ears and an intoxication due neither to wine
nor waltzing in his brain

Good man shouted Deighton of the Horse Battery through the mists
Whar you raise dat tonga Im coming with you Ow But Ive had a head
and a half I didnt sit out all night They say the Batterys awful
bad and he hummed dolorouslyLeave the what at the whatsitsname
Leave the flock without shelter Leave the corpse uninterred Leave the
bride at the altar

My faith Itll be more bally corpse than bride though this journey Jump
in Bobby Get on Coachman

On the Umballa platform waited a detachment of officers discussing the
latest news from the stricken cantonment and it was here that Bobby
learned the real condition of the Tail Twisters

They went into camp said an elderly Major recalled from the
whisttables at Mussoorie to a sickly Native Regiment they went into
camp with two hundred and ten sick in carts Two hundred and ten fever
cases only and the balance looking like so many ghosts with sore eyes
A Madras Regiment could have walked through em

But they were as fit as bedamned when I left them said Bobby

Then youd better make them as fit as bedamned when you rejoin said
the Major brutally

Bobby pressed his forehead against the rainsplashed windowpane as the
train lumbered across the sodden Doab and prayed for the health of the
Tyneside Tail Twisters Naini Tal had sent down her contingent with
all speed the lathering ponies of the Dalhousie Road staggered into
Pathankot taxed to the full stretch of their strength while from
cloudy Darjiling the Calcutta Mail whirled up the last straggler of the
little army that was to fight a fight in which was neither medal nor
honor for the winning against an enemy none other than the sickness
that destroyeth in the noonday

And as each man reported himself he said This is a bad business
and went about his own forthwith for every Regiment and Battery in the
cantonment was under canvas the sickness bearing them company

Bobby fought his way through the rain to the Tail Twisters temporary
mess and Revere could have fallen on the boys neck for the joy of
seeing that ugly wholesome phiz once more

Keep em amused and interested said Revere They went on the drink
poor fools after the first two cases and there was no improvement Oh
its good to have you back Bobby Porkiss is anever mind

Deighton came over from the Artillery camp to attend a dreary mess
dinner and contributed to the general gloom by nearly weeping over the
condition of his beloved Battery Porkiss so far forgot himself as to
insinuate that the presence of the officers could do no earthly good
and that the best thing would be to send the entire Regiment into
hospital and let the doctors look after them Porkiss was demoralized
with fear nor was his peace of mind restored when Revere said coldly
Oh The sooner you go out the better if thats your way of thinking
Any public school could send us fifty good men in your place but it
takes time time Porkiss and money and a certain amount of trouble
to make a Regiment Spose youre the person we go into camp for eh

Whereupon Porkiss was overtaken with a great and chilly fear which a
drenching in the rain did not allay and two days later quitted this
world for another where men do fondly hope allowances are made for the
weaknesses of the flesh The Regimental SergeantMajor looked wearily
across the Sergeants Mess tent when the news was announced

There goes the worst of them he said Itll take the best and then
please God itll stop The Sergeants were silent till one said It
couldnt be him and all knew of whom Travis was thinking

Bobby Wick stormed through the tents of his Company rallying
rebuking mildly as is consistent with the Regulations chaffing the
fainthearted haling the sound into the watery sunlight when there
was a break in the weather and bidding them be of good cheer for
their trouble was nearly at an end scuttling on his dun pony round
the outskirts of the camp and heading back men who with the innate
perversity of British soldiers were always wandering into infected
villages or drinking deeply from rainflooded marshes comforting the
panicstricken with rude speech and more than once tending the dying
who had no friendsthe men without townies organizing with banjos
and burned cork Singsongs which should allow the talent of the
Regiment full play and generally as he explained playing the giddy
gardengoat all round

Youre worth half a dozen of us Bobby said Revere in a moment of
enthusiasm How the devil do you keep it up

Bobby made no answer but had Revere looked into the breastpocket of
his coat he might have seen there a sheaf of badlywritten letters which
perhaps accounted for the power that possessed the boy A letter came
to Bobby every other day The spelling was not above reproach but the
sentiments must have been most satisfactory for on receipt Bobbys eyes
softened marvelously and he was wont to fall into a tender abstraction
for a while ere shaking his cropped head he charged into his work

By what power he drew after him the hearts of the roughest and the
Tail Twisters counted in their ranks some rough diamonds indeed was
a mystery to both skipper and C O who learned from the regimental
chaplain that Bobby was considerably more in request in the hospital
tents than the Reverend John Emery

The men seem fond of you Are you in the hospitals much said the
Colonel who did his daily round and ordered the men to get well with a
hardness that did not cover his bitter grief

A little sir said Bobby

Shouldnt go there too often if I were you They say its not
contagious but theres no use in running unnecessary risks We cant
afford to have you down yknow

Six days later it was with the utmost difficulty that the postrunner
plashed his way out to the camp with mailbags for the rain was falling
in torrents Bobby received a letter bore it off to his tent and the
programme for the next weeks Singsong being satisfactorily disposed
of sat down to answer it For an hour the unhandy pen toiled over the
paper and where sentiment rose to more than normal tidelevel Bobby
Wick stuck out his tongue and breathed heavily He was not used to
letterwriting

Beg ypardon sir said a voice at the tent door but Dormers orrid
bad sir an theyve taken him orf sir

Damn Private Dormer and you too said Bobby Wick running the blotter
over the halffinished letter Tell him Ill come in the morning

Es awful bad sir said the voice hesitatingly There was an
undecided squelching of heavy boots

Well said Bobby impatiently

Excusin imself before an for takin the liberty e says it would be
a comfort for to assist im sir if

Tattoo lao Get my pony Here come in out of the rain till Im ready
What blasted nuisances you are Thats brandy Drink some you want it
Hang on to my stirrup and tell me if I go mo fast

Strengthened by a fourfinger nip which he swallowed without a wink
the Hospital Orderly kept up with the slipping mudstained and very
disgusted pony as it shambled to the hospital tent

Private Dormer was certainly orrid bad He had all but reached the
stage of collapse and was not pleasant to look upon

Whats this Dormer said Bobby bending over the man Youre not
going out this time Youve got to come fishin with me once or twice
more yet

The blue lips parted and in the ghost of a whisper saidBeg ypardon
sir disturbin of you now but would you min oldin my and sir

Bobby sat on the side of the bed and the icy cold hand closed on his
own like a vice forcing a ladys ring which was on the little finger
deep into the flesh Bobby set his lips and waited the water dripping
from the hem of his trousers An hour passed and the grasp of the hand
did not relax nor did the expression on the drawn face change Bobby
with infinite craft lit himself a cheroot with the left handhis right
arm was numbed to the elbowand resigned himself to a night of pain

Dawn showed a very whitefaced Subaltern sitting on the side of a
sick mans cot and a Doctor in the doorway using language unfit for
publication

Have you been here all night you young ass said the Doctor

There or thereabouts said Bobby ruefully Hes frozen on to me

Dormers mouth shut with a click He turned his head and sighed The
clinging band opened and Bobbys arm fell useless at his side

Hell do said the Doctor quietly It must have been a tossup all
through the night Think youre to be congratulated on this case

Oh bosh said Bobby I thought the man had gone out long
agoonlyonly I didnt care to take my hand away Rub my arm down
theres a good chap What a grip the brute has Im chilled to the
marrow He passed out of the tent shivering

Private Dormer was allowed to celebrate his repulse of Death by strong
waters Four days later he sat on the side of his cot and said to the
patients mildly Id a liken to a spoken to imso I should

But at that time Bobby was reading yet another letterhe had the most
persistent correspondent of any man in campand was even then about to
write that the sickness had abated and in another week at the outside
would be gone He did not intend to say that the chill of a sick mans
hand seemed to have struck into the heart whose capacities for affection
he dwelt on at such length He did intend to enclose the illustrated
programme of the forthcoming Singsong whereof he was not a little
proud He also intended to write on many other matters which do not
concern us and doubtless would have done so but for the slight feverish
headache which made him dull and unresponsive at mess

You are overdoing it Bobby said his skipper Might give the rest
of us credit of doing a little work You go on as if you were the whole
Mess rolled into one Take it easy

I will said Bobby Im feeling done up somehow Revere looked at
him anxiously and said nothing

There was a flickering of lanterns about the camp that night and a
rumor that brought men out of their cots to the tent doors a paddling
of the naked feet of dooliebearers and the rush of a galloping horse

Wots up asked twenty tents and through twenty tents ran the
answerWick es down

They brought the news to Revere and he groaned Any one but Bobby and I
shouldnt have cared The SergeantMajor was right

Not going out this journey gasped Bobby as he was lifted from
the doolie Not going out this journey Then with an air of supreme
convictionI cant you see

Not if I can do anything said the SurgeonMajor who had hastened
over from the mess where he had been dining

He and the Regimental Surgeon fought together with Death for the life
of Bobby Wick Their work was interrupted by a hairy apparition in a
bluegrey dressinggown who stared in horror at the bed and criedOh
my Gawd It cant be im until an indignant Hospital Orderly whisked
him away

If care of man and desire to live could have done aught Bobby would
have been saved As it was he made a fight of three days and the
SurgeonMajors brow uncreased Well save him yet he said and the
Surgeon who though he ranked with the Captain had a very youthful
heart went out upon the word and pranced joyously in the mud

Not going out this journey whispered Bobby Wick gallantly at the
end of the third day

Bravo said the SurgeonMajor Thats the way to look at it Bobby

As evening fell a grey shade gathered round Bobbys mouth and he turned
his face to the tent wall wearily The SurgeonMajor frowned

Im awfully tired said Bobby very faintly Whats the use of
bothering me with medicine Idontwantit Let me alone

The desire for life had departed and Bobby was content to drift away on
the easy tide of Death

Its no good said the SurgeonMajor He doesnt want to live Hes
meeting it poor child And he blew his nose

Half a mile away the regimental band was playing the overture to the
Singsong for the men had been told that Bobby was out of danger The
clash of the brass and the wail of the horns reached Bobbys ears

 Is there a single joy or pain
 That I should never knoow
 You do not love me tis in vain
 Bid me goodbye and go

An expression of hopeless irritation crossed the boys face and he
tried to shake his head

The SurgeonMajor bent downWhat is it Bobby

Not that waltz muttered Bobby Thats our ownour very ownest own
Mummy dear

With this he sank into the stupor that gave place to death early next
morning

Revere his eyes red at the rims and his nose very white went into
Bobbys tent to write a letter to Papa Wick which should bow the white
head of the exCommissioner of ChotaBuldana in the keenest sorrow of
his life Bobbys little store of papers lay in confusion on the table
and among them a halffinished letter The last sentence ran So you
see darling there is really no fear because as long as I know you
care for me and I care for you nothing can touch me

Revere stayed in the tent for an hour When he came out his eyes were
redder than ever

    

Private Conklin sat on a turneddown bucket and listened to a not unfamiliar
tune Private Conklin was a convalescent and should have been tenderly
treated

Ho said Private Conklin Theres another bloomin orfcer dead

The bucket shot from under him and his eyes filled with a smithyful of
sparks A tall man in a bluegrey bedgown was regarding him with deep
disfavor

You ought to take shame for yourself Conky Orfcerbloomin
orfcer Ill learn you to misname the likes of im Hangel Bloomin
Hangel Thats wot e is

And the Hospital Orderly was so satisfied with the justice of the
punishment that he did not even order Private Dormer back to his cot

    




IN THE MATTER OF A PRIVATE

 Hurrah hurrah a soldiers life for me
 Shout boys shout for it makes you jolly and free
 The Ramrod Corps

People who have seen say that one of the quaintest spectacles of
human frailty is an outbreak of hysterics in a girls school It starts
without warning generally on a hot afternoon among the elder pupils A
girl giggles till the giggle gets beyond control Then she throws up her
head and cries Honk honk honk like a wild goose and tears mix
with the laughter If the mistress be wise she will rap out something
severe at this point to check matters If she be tenderhearted and
send for a drink of water the chances are largely in favor of another
girl laughing at the afflicted one and herself collapsing Thus the
trouble spreads and may end in half of what answers to the Lower Sixth
of a boys school rocking and whooping together Given a week of warm
weather two stately promenades per diem a heavy mutton and rice meal
in the middle of the day a certain amount of nagging from the teachers
and a few other things some amazing effects develop At least this is
what folk say who have had experience

Now the Mother Superior of a Convent and the Colonel of a British
Infantry Regiment would be justly shocked at any comparison being made
between their respective charges But it is a fact that under certain
circumstances Thomas in bulk can be worked up into dithering rippling
hysteria He does not weep but he shows his trouble unmistakably and
the consequences get into the newspapers and all the good people
who hardly know a Martini from a Snider say Take away the brutes
ammunition

Thomas isnt a brute and his business which is to look after the
virtuous people demands that he shall have his ammunition to his hand
He doesnt wear silk stockings and he really ought to be supplied with
a new Adjective to help him to express his opinions but for all that
he is a great man If you call him the heroic defender of the national
honor one day and a brutal and licentious soldiery the next you
naturally bewilder him and he looks upon you with suspicion There is
nobody to speak for Thomas except people who have theories to work off
on him and nobody understands Thomas except Thomas and he does not
always know what is the matter with himself

That is the prologue This is the story

Corporal Slane was engaged to be married to Miss Jhansi MKenna
whose history is well known in the regiment and elsewhere He had his
Colonels permission and being popular with the men every arrangement
had been made to give the wedding what Private Ortheris called eeklar
It fell in the heart of the hot weather and after the wedding
Slane was going up to the Hills with the Bride None the less Slanes
grievance was that the affair would Be only a hiredcarriage wedding
and he felt that the eeklar of that was meagre Miss MKenna did
not care so much The Sergeants wife was helping her to make her
weddingdress and she was very busy Slane was just then the only
moderately contented man in barracks All the rest were more or less
miserable

And they had so much to make them happy too All their work was over
at eight in the morning and for the rest of the day they could lie on
their backs and smoke Canteenplug and swear at the punkahcoolies They
enjoyed a fine full flesh meal in the middle of the day and then threw
themselves down on their cots and sweated and slept till it was cool
enough to go out with their towny whose vocabulary contained less
than six hundred words and the Adjective and whose views on every
conceivable question they had heard many times before

There was the Canteen of course and there was the Temperance Room with
the secondhand papers in it but a man of any profession cannot read
for eight hours a day in a temperature of 96 degrees or 98 degrees in
the shade running up sometimes to 103 degrees at midnight Very few
men even though they get a pannikin of flat stale muddy beer and hide
it under their cots can continue drinking for six hours a day One man
tried but he died and nearly the whole regiment went to his funeral
because it gave them something to do It was too early for the
excitement of fever or cholera The men could only wait and wait and
wait and watch the shadow of the barrack creeping across the blinding
white dust That was a gay life

They lounged about cantonmentsit was too hot for any sort of game
and almost too hot for viceand fuddled themselves in the evening
and filled themselves to distension with the healthy nitrogenous food
provided for them and the more they stoked the less exercise they took
and more explosive they grew Then tempers began to wear away and men
fell abrooding over insults real or imaginary for they had nothing
else to think of The tone of the repartees changed and instead of
saying lightheartedly Ill knock your silly face in men grew
laboriously polite and hinted that the cantonments were not big enough
for themselves and their enemy and that there would be more space for
one of the two in another place

It may have been the Devil who arranged the thing but the fact of the
case is that Losson had for a long time been worrying Simmons in an
aimless way It gave him occupation The two had their cots side by
side and would sometimes spend a long afternoon swearing at each other
but Simmons was afraid of Losson and dared not challenge him to a fight
He thought over the words in the hot still nights and half the hate he
felt toward Losson be vented on the wretched punkahcoolie

Losson bought a parrot in the bazar and put it into a little cage
and lowered the cage into the cool darkness of a well and sat on the
wellcurb shouting bad language down to the parrot He taught it to
say Simmons ye sooor which means swine and several other things
entirely unfit for publication He was a big gross man and he shook
like a jelly when the parrot had the sentence correctly Simmons
however shook with rage for all the room were laughing at himthe
parrot was such a disreputable puff of green feathers and it looked so
human when it chattered Losson used to sit swinging his fat legs on
the side of the cot and ask the parrot what it thought of Simmons The
parrot would answer Simmons ye sooor Good boy Losson used to
say scratching the parrots head ye ear that Sim

And Simmons used to turn over on his stomach and make answer I ear
Take eed you dont ear something one of these days

In the restless nights after he had been asleep all day fits of blind
rage came upon Simmons and held him till he trembled all over while he
thought in how many different ways he would slay Losson Sometimes he
would picture himself trampling the life out of the man with heavy
ammunitionboots and at others smashing in his face with the butt and
at others jumping on his shoulders and dragging the head back till the
neckbone cracked Then his mouth would feel hot and fevered and he
would reach out for another sup of the beer in the pannikin

But the fancy that came to him most frequently and stayed with him
longest was one connected with the great roll of fat under Lossons
right ear He noticed it first on a moonlight night and thereafter
it was always before his eyes It was a fascinating roll of fat A man
could get his hand upon it and tear away one side of the neck or he
could place the muzzle of a rifle on it and blow away all the head in
a flash Losson had no right to be sleek and contented and welltodo
when he Simmons was the butt of the room Some day perhaps he would
show those who laughed at the Simmons ye sooor joke that he was as
good as the rest and held a mans life in the crook of his forefinger
When Losson snored Simmons hated him more bitterly than ever Why
should Losson be able to sleep when Simmons had to stay awake hour after
hour tossing and turning on the tapes with the dull liver pain gnawing
into his right side and his head throbbing and aching after Canteen He
thought over this for many nights and the world became unprofitable to
him He even blunted his naturally fine appetite with beer and tobacco
and all the while the parrot talked at and made a mock of him

The heat continued and the tempers wore away more quickly than before
A Sergeants wife died of heatapoplexy in the night and the rumor ran
abroad that it was cholera Men rejoiced openly hoping that it would
spread and send them into camp But that was a false alarm

It was late on a Tuesday evening and the men were waiting in the deep
double verandas for Last Posts when Simmons went to the box at the
foot of his bed took out his pipe and slammed the lid down with a
bang that echoed through the deserted barrack like the crack of a rifle
Ordinarily speaking the men would have taken no notice but their
nerves were fretted to fiddlestrings They jumped up and three or four
clattered into the barrackroom only to find Simmons kneeling by his
box

Owl Its you is it they said and laughed foolishly We t h o u g
h t twasSimmons rose slowly If the accident had so shaken his
fellows what would not the reality do

You thought it wasdid you And what makes you think he said
lashing himself into madness as he went on to Hell with your thinking
ye dirty spies

Simmons ye sooor chuckled the parrot in the veranda sleepily
recognizing a wellknown voice Now that was absolutely all

The tension snapped Simmons fell back on the armrack
deliberatelythe men were at the far end of the roomand took out
his rifle and packet of ammunition Dont go playing the goat Sim
said Losson Put it down but there was a quaver in his voice Another
man stooped slipped his boot and hurled it at Simmonss head The
prompt answer was a shot which fired at random found its billet in
Lossons throat Losson fell forward without a word and the others
scattered

You thought it was yelled Simmons Youre drivin me to it I tell
you youre drivin me to it Get up Losson an dont lie shammin
thereyou an your blasted parrit that druv me to it

But there was an unaffected reality about Lossons pose that showed
Simmons what he had done The men were still clamoring on the veranda
Simmons appropriated two more packets of ammunition and ran into the
moonlight muttering Ill make a night of it Thirty rouns an the
last for myself Take you that you dogs

He dropped on one knee and fired into the brown of the men on the
veranda but the bullet flew high and landed in the brickwork with a
vicious phat that made some of the younger ones turn pale It is as
musketry theorists observe one thing to fire and another to be fired
at

Then the instinct of the chase flared up The news spread from barrack
to barrack and the men doubled out intent on the capture of Simmons
the wild beast who was heading for the Cavalry paradeground stopping
now and again to send back a shot and a curse in the direction of his
pursuers

Ill learn you to spy on me he shouted Ill learn you to give me
dorgs names Come on the ole lot o you Colonel John Anthony Deever
CBhe turned toward the Infantry Mess and shook his rifleyou
think yourself the devil of a manbut I tell you that if you put your
ugly old carcass outside o that door Ill make you the poorestlookin
man in the army Come out Colonel John Anthony Deever CB Come
out and see me practiss on the rainge Im the crack shot of the ole
bloomin battalion In proof of which statement Simmons fired at the
lighted windows of the messhouse

Private Simmons E Compny on the Cavalry pradeground Sir with
thirty rounds said a Sergeant breathlessly to the Colonel Shootin
right and lef Sir Shot Private Losson Whats to be done Sir

Colonel John Anthony Deever CB sallied out only to be saluted by s
spurt of dust at his feet

Pull up said the Second in Command I dont want my step in that
way Colonel Hes as dangerous as a mad dog

Shoot him like one then said the Colonel bitterly if he wont
take his chance My regiment too If it had been the Towheads I could
have under stood

Private Simmons had occupied a strong position near a well on the edge
of the paradeground and was defying the regiment to come on The
regiment was not anxious to comply for there is small honor in being
shot by a fellowprivate Only Corporal Slane rifle in band threw
himself down on the ground and wormed his way toward the well

Dont shoot said he to the men round him like as not youll hit me
Ill catch the beggar livin

Simmons ceased shouting for a while and the noise of trapwheels could
be heard across the plain Major Oldyn commanding the Horse Battery
was coming back from a dinner in the Civil Lines was driving after his
usual customthat is to say as fast as the horse could go

A orfcer A blooming spangled orfcer shrieked Simmons Ill make a
scarecrow of that orfcer The trap stopped

Whats this demanded the Major of Gunners You there drop your
rifle

Why its Jerry Blazes I aint got no quarrel with you Jerry Blazes
Pass frien an alls well

But Jerry Blazes had not the faintest intention of passing a dangerous
murderer He was as his adoring Battery swore long and fervently
without knowledge of fear and they were surely the best judges for
Jerry Blazes it was notorious had done his possible to kill a man each
time the Battery went out

He walked toward Simmons with the intention of rushing him and
knocking him down

Dont make me do it Sir said Simmons I aint got nothing agin you
Ah you wouldthe Major broke into a runTake that then

The Major dropped with a bullet through his shoulder and Simmons stood
over him He had lost the satisfaction of killing Losson in the desired
way hut here was a helpless body to his hand Should be slip in another
cartridge and blow off the head or with the butt smash in the white
face He stopped to consider and a cry went up from the far side of
the paradeground Hes killed Jerry Blazes But in the shelter of the
wellpillars Simmons was safe except when he stepped out to fire Ill
blow yer andsome ead off Jerry Blazes said Simmons reflectively
Six an three is nine an one is ten an that leaves me another
nineteen an one for myself He tugged at the string of the second
packet of ammunition Corporal Slane crawled out of the shadow of a bank
into the moonlight

I see you said Simmons Come a bit furder on an Ill do for you

Im comm said Corporal Slane briefly youve done a bad days
work Sim Come out ere an come back with me

Come tolaughed Simmons sending a cartridge home with his thumb
Not before Ive settled you an Jerry Blazes

The Corporal was lying at full length in the dust of the paradeground
a rifle under him Some of the lesscautious men in the distance
shouted Shoot im Shoot im Slane

You move and or foot Slane said Simmons an Ill kick Jerry
Blazes ead in and shoot you after

I aint movin said the Corporal raising his head you darent it
a man on is legs Let go o Jerry Blazes an come out o that with your
fistes Come an it me You darent you bloomin dogshooter

I dare

You lie you mansticker You sneakin Sheeny butcher you lie See
there Slane kicked the rifle away and stood up in the peril of his
life Come on now

The temptation was more than Simmons could resist for the Corporal in
his white clothes offered a perfect mark

Dont misname me shouted Simmons firing as he spoke The shot
missed and the shooter blind with rage threw his rifle down and
rushed at Slane from the protection of the well Within striking
distance he kicked savagely at Slanes stomach but the weedy Corporal
knew something of Simmonss weakness and knew too the deadly guard
for that kick Bowing forward and drawing up his right leg till the heel
of the right foot was set some three inches above the inside of the left
kneecap he met the blow standing on one legexactly as Gonds stand
when they meditateand ready for the fall that would follow There was
an oath the Corporal fell over his own left as shinbone met shinbone
and the Private collapsed his right leg broken an inch above the ankle

Pity you dont know that guard Sim said Slane spitting out the
dust as he rose Then raising his voice Come an take him orf
Ive bruk is leg This was not strictly true for the Private had
accomplished his own downfall since it is the special merit of
that legguard that the harder the kick the greater the kickers
discomfiture

Slane walked to Jerry Blazes and hung over him with ostentatious
anxiety while Simmons weeping with pain was carried away Ope you
aint urt badly Sir said Slane The Major had fainted and there was
an ugly ragged hole through the top of his arm Slane knelt down
and murmured Selp me I believe es dead Well if that aint my
blooming luck all over

But the Major was destined to lead his Battery afield for many a long
day with unshaken nerve He was removed and nursed and petted into
convalescence while the Battery discussed the wisdom of capturing
Simmons and blowing him from a gun They idolized their Major and his
reappearance on parade brought about a scene nowhere provided for in the
Army Regulations

Great too was the glory that fell to Slanes share The Gunners would
have made him drunk thrice a day for at least a fortnight Even the
Colonel of his own regiment complimented him upon his coolness and the
local paper called him a hero These things did not puff him up When
the Major offered him money and thanks the virtuous Corporal took the
one and put aside the other But he had a request to make and prefaced
it with many a Beg ypardon Sir Could the Major see his way to
letting the SlaneMKenna wedding be adorned by the presence of four
Battery horses to pull a hired barouche The Major could and so could
the Battery Excessively so It was a gorgeous wedding

    

Wot did I do it for said Corporal Slane For the orses O course
Jhansi aint a beauty to look at but I wasnt goin to ave a hired
turnout Jerry Blazes If I adnt a wanted something Sim might ha
blowed Jerry Blazes blooming ead into Hirish stew for aught Id a
cared

And they hanged Private Simmonshanged him as high as Haman in hollow
square of the regiment and the Colonel said it was Drink and the
Chaplain was sure it was the Devil and Simmons fancied it was both
but he didnt know and only hoped his fate would be a warning to
his companions and half a dozen intelligent publicists wrote six
beautiful leading articles on The Prevalence of Crime in the Army

But not a soul thought of comparing the bloodyminded Simmons to the
squawking gaping schoolgirl with which this story opens




THE ENLIGHTENMENTS OF PAGETT MP

 Because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring
 with their importunate chink while thousands of great cattle
 reposed beneath the shadow of the British oak chew the cud and are
 silent pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are the
 only inhabitants of the fieldthat of course they are many in
 number or that after all they are other than the little
 shrivelled meagre hopping though loud and troublesome insects of
 the hour
 Burke Reflections on the Revolution in France

They were sitting in the veranda of the splendid palace of an Indian
ProConsul surrounded by all the glory and mystery of the immemorial
East In plain English it was a onestoried tenroomed whitewashed
mudroofed bungalow set in a dry garden of dusty tamarisk trees and
divided from the road by a low mud wall The green parrots screamed
overhead as they flew in battalions to the river for their morning
drink Beyond the wall clouds of fine dust showed where the cattle and
goats of the city were passing afield to graze The remorseless white
light of the winter sunshine of Northern India lay upon everything and
improved nothing from the whining Persianwheel by the lawntennis
court to the long perspective of level road and the blue domed tombs of
Mohammedan saints just visible above the trees

A Happy New Year said Orde to his guest Its the first youve ever
spent out of England isnt it

Yes Happy New Year said Pagett smiling at the sunshine What a
divine climate you have here Just think of the brown cold fog hanging
over London now And he rubbed his hands

It was more than twenty years since he had last seen Orde his
schoolmate and their paths in the world had divided early The one
had quitted college to become a cogwheel in the machinery of the great
Indian Government the other more blessed with goods had been whirled
into a similar position in the English scheme Three successive
elections had not affected Pagetts position with a loyal constituency
and he had grown insensibly to regard himself in some sort as a pillar
of the Empire whose real worth would be known later on After a few
years of conscientious attendance at many divisions after newspaper
battles innumerable and the publication of interminable correspondence
and more hasty oratory than in his calmer moments he cared to think
upon it occurred to him as it had occurred to many of his fellows in
Parliament that a tour to India would enable him to sweep a larger lyre
and address himself to the problems of Imperial administration with a
firmer hand Accepting therefore a general invitation extended to him
by Orde some years before Pagett bad taken ship to Karachi and only
overnight had been received with joy by the DeputyCommissioner of
Amara They had sat late discussing the changes and chances of twenty
years recalling the names of the dead and weighing the futures of the
living as is the custom of men meeting after intervals of action

Next morning they smoked the afterbreakfast pipe in the veranda still
regarding each other curiously Pagett in a light grey frockcoat and
garments much too thin for the time of the year and a puggried
sunhat carefully and wonderfully made Orde in a shooting coat riding
breeches brown cowhide boots with spurs and a battered flax helmet He
had ridden some miles in the early morning to inspect a doubtful river
dam The mens faces differed as much as their attire Ordes worn and
wrinkled around the eyes and grizzled at the temples was the harder
and more square of the two and it was with something like envy that the
owner looked at the comfortable outlines of Pagetts blandly receptive
countenance the clear skin the untroubled eye and the mobile
cleanshaved lips

And this is India said Pagett for the twentieth time staring long and
intently at the grey feathering of the tamarisks

One portion of India only Its very much like this for 300 miles
in every direction By the way now that you have rested a littleI
wouldnt ask the old question beforewhat dyou think of the country

Tis the most pervasive country that ever yet was seen I acquired
several pounds of your country coming up from Karachi The air is heavy
with it and for miles and miles along that distressful eternity of rail
theres no horizon to show where air and earth separate

Yes It isnt easy to see truly or far in India But you had a decent
passage out hadnt you

Very good on the whole Your AngloIndian may be unsympathetic about
ones political views but he has reduced ship life to a science

The AngloIndian is a political orphan and if hes wise he wont be
in a hurry to be adopted by your party grandmothers But how were your
companions unsympathetic

Well there was a man called Dawlishe a judge somewhere in this
country it seems and a capital partner at whist by the way and when I
wanted to talk to him about the progress of India in a political sense
Orde hid a grin which might or might not have been sympathetic the
National Congress movement and other things in which as a Member of
Parliament Im of course interested he shifted the subject and when I
once cornered him he looked me calmly in the eye and said Thats all
Tommy rot Come and have a game at Bull You may laugh but that isnt
the way to treat a great and important question and knowing who I was
well I thought it rather rude dont you know and yet Dawlishe is a
thoroughly good fellow

Yes hes a friend of mine and one of the straightest men I know I
suppose like many AngloIndians he felt it was hopeless to give you
any just idea of any Indian question without the documents before you
and in this case the documents you want are the country and the people

Precisely That was why I came straight to you bringing an open mind
to bear on things Im anxious to know what popular feeling in India
is really like yknow now that it has wakened into political life
The National Congress in spite of Dawlishe must have caused great
excitement among the masses

On the contrary nothing could be more tranquil than the state of
popular feeling and as to excitement the people would as soon be
excited over the Rule of Three as over the Congress

Excuse me Orde but do you think you are a fair judge Isnt the
official AngloIndian naturally jealous of any external influences
that might move the masses and so much opposed to liberal ideas truly
liberal ideas that he can scarcely be expected to regard a popular
movement with fairness

What did Dawlishe say about Tommy Rot Think a moment old man You
and I were brought up together taught by the same tutors read the same
books lived the same life and new languages and work among new
races while you more fortunate remain at home Why should I change
my mindour mindbecause I change my sky Why should I and the
few hundred Englishmen in my service become unreasonable prejudiced
fossils while you and your newer friends alone remain bright and
openminded You surely dont fancy civilians are members of a Primrose
League

Of course not but the mere position of an English official gives him
a point of view which cannot but bias his mind on this question Pagett
moved his knee up and down a little uneasily as he spoke

That sounds plausible enough but like more plausible notions on
Indian matters I believe its a mistake Youll find when you come to
consult the unofficial Briton that our fault as a classI speak of
the civilian nowis rather to magnify the progress that has been made
toward liberal institutions It is of English origin such as it is and
the stress of our work since the Mutinyonly thirty years agohas
been in that direction No I think you will get no fairer or more
dispassionate view of the Congress business than such men as I can give
you But I may as well say at once that those who know most of India
from the inside are inclined to wonder at the noise our scarcely begun
experiment makes in England

But surely the gathering together of Congress delegates is of itself a
new thing

Theres nothing new under the sun When Europe was a jungle half Asia
flocked to the canonical conferences of Buddhism and for centuries the
people have gathered at Pun Hurdwar Trimbak and Benares in immense
numbers A great meeting what you call a mass meeting is really one of
the oldest and most popular of Indian institutions in this topsyturvy
land and though they have been employed in clerical work for
generations they have no practical knowledge of affairs A ships clerk
is a useful person but he is scarcely the captain and an orderly room
writer however smart he may be is not the colonel You see the writer
class in India has never till now aspired to anything like command It
wasnt allowed to The Indian gentleman for thousands of years past
has resembled Victor Hugos noble

Un vrai sire Chatelain Laisse ecrire Le vilain Sa main digne Quand il
signe Egratigne Le velin

And the little egratignures he most likes to make have been scored
pretty deeply by the sword

But this is childish and mediaeval nonsense

Precisely and from your or rather our point of view the pen is
mightier than the sword In this country its otherwise The fault
lies in our Indian balances not yet adjusted to civilized weights and
measures

Well at all events this literary class represent the natural
aspirations and wishes of the people at large though it may not exactly
lead them and in spite of all you say Orde I defy you to find
a really sound English Radical who would not sympathize with those
aspirations

Pagett spoke with some warmth and he had scarcely ceased when a
wellappointed dogcart turned into the compound gates and Orde
rose saying Here is Edwards the Master of the Lodge I neglect so
diligently come to talk about accounts I suppose

As the vehicle drove up under the porch Pagett also rose saying with
the trained effusion born of much practice But this is also my friend
my old and valued friend Edwards Im delighted to see you I knew you
were in India but not exactly where

Then it isnt accounts Mr Edwards said Orde cheerily

Why no sir I heard Mr Pagett was coming and as our works were
closed for the New Year I thought I would drive over and see him

A very happy thought Mr Edwards you may not know Orde was a
leading member of our Radical Club at Switchton when I was beginning
political life and I owe much to his exertions Theres no pleasure
like meeting an old friend except perhaps making a new one I
suppose Mr Edwards you stick to the good old cause

Well you see sir things are different out here Theres precious
little one can find to say against the Government which was the main of
our talk at home and them that do say things are not the sort o people
a man who respects himself would like to be mixed up with There are no
politics in a manner of speaking in India Its all work

Surely you are mistaken my good friend Why I have come all the way
from England just to see the working of this great National movement

I dont know where youre going to find the nation as moves to begin
with and then youll be hard put to it to find what they are moving
about Its like this sir said Edwards who had not quite relished
being called my good friend They havent got any grievancenothing
to hit with dont you see sir and then theres not much to hit
against because the Government is more like a kind of general
Providence directing an oldestablished state of things than that
at home where theres something new thrown down for us to fight about
every three months

You are probably in your workshops full of English mechanics out of
the way of learning what the masses think

I dont know so much about that There are four of us English foremen
and between seven and eight hundred native fitters smiths carpenters
painters and such like

And they are full of the Congress of course

Never hear a word of it from years end to years end and I speak the
talk too But I wanted to ask how things are going on at homeold Tyler
and Brown and the rest

We will speak of them presently but your account of the indifference
of your men surprises me almost as much as your own I fear you are a
backslider from the good old doctrine Edwards Pagett spoke as one who
mourned the death of a near relative

Not a bit Sir but I should be if I took up with a parcel of baboos
pleaders and schoolboys as never did a days work in their lives and
couldnt if they tried And if you was to poll us English railway
men mechanics tradespeople and the like of that all up and down the
country from Peshawur to Calcutta you would find us mostly in a tale
together And yet youd know were the same English you pay some respect
to at home at lection time and we have the pull o knowing something
about it

This is very curious but you will let me come and see you and perhaps
you will kindly show me the railway works and we will talk things over
at leisure And about all old friends and old times added Pagett
detecting with quick insight a look of disappointment in the mechanics
face

Nodding briefly to Orde Edwards mounted his dogcart and drove off

Its very disappointing said the Member to Orde who while his
friend discoursed with Edwards had been looking over a bundle of
sketches drawn on grey paper in purple ink brought to him by a
Chuprassee

Dont let it trouble you old chap said Orde sympathetically Look
here a moment here are some sketches by the man who made the carved
wood screen you admired so much in the diningroom and wanted a copy
of and the artist himself is here too

A native said Pagett

Of course was the reply Bishen Singh is his name and he has two
brothers to help him When there is an important job to do the three go
into partnership but they spend most of their time and all their money
in litigation over an inheritance and Im afraid they are getting
involved Thoroughbred Sikhs of the old rock obstinate touchy
bigoted and cunning but good men for all that Here is Bishen
Singhshall we ask him about the Congress

But Bishen Singh who approached with a respectful salaam had never
heard of it and he listened with a puzzled face and obviously feigned
interest to Ordes account of its aims and objects finally shaking his
vast white turban with great significance when he learned that it was
promoted by certain pleaders named by Orde and by educated natives
He began with labored respect to explain how he was a poor man with no
concern in such matters which were all under the control of God but
presently broke out of Urdu into familiar Punjabi the mere sound of
which had a rustic smack of village smokereek and ploughtail as
he denounced the wearers of white coats the jugglers with words who
filched his field from him the men whose backs were never bowed in
honest work and poured ironical scorn on the Bengali He and one of
his brothers had seen Calcutta and being at work there had Bengali
carpenters given to them as assistants

Those carpenters said Bishen Singh Black apes were more efficient
workmates and as for the Bengali babutchick The guttural click
needed no interpretation but Orde translated the rest while Pagett
gazed with interest at the woodcarver

He seems to have a most illiberal prejudice against the Bengali said
the MP

Yes its very sad that for ages outside Bengal there should be so
bitter a prejudice Pride of race which also means racehatred is the
plague and curse of India and it spreads far Orde pointed with his
ridingwhip to the large map of India on the veranda wall

See I begin with the North said he Theres the Afghan and as
a highlander he despises all the dwellers in Hindoostanwith the
exception of the Sikh whom he hates as cordially as the Sikh hates him
The Hindu loathes Sikh and Afghan and the Rajputthats a little lower
down across this yellow blot of deserthas a strong objection to put
it mildly to the Maratha who by the way poisonously hates the Afghan
Lets go North a minute The Sindhi hates everybody Ive mentioned Very
good well take less warlike races The cultivator of Northern India
domineers over the man in the next province and the Behari of the
Northwest ridicules the Bengali They are all at one on that point
Im giving you merely the roughest possible outlines of the facts of
course

Bishen Singh his clean cut nostrils still quivering watched the large
sweep of the whip as it traveled from the frontier through Sindh the
Punjab and Rajputana till it rested by the valley of the Jumna

Hateeternal and inextinguishable hate concluded Orde flicking the
lash of the whip across the large map from East to West as he sat down
Remember Cannings advice to Lord Granville Never write or speak of
Indian things without looking at a map

Pagett opened his eyes Orde resumed And the racehatred is only a
part of it Whats really the matter with Bishen Singh is classhatred
which unfortunately is even more intense and more widely spread
Thats one of the little drawbacks of caste which some of your recent
English writers find an impeccable system

The woodcarver was glad to be recalled to the business of his craft
and his eyes shone as he received instructions for a carved wooden
doorway for Pagett which he promised should be splendidly executed and
despatched to England in six months It is an irrelevant detail but in
spite of Ordes reminders fourteen months elapsed before the work was
finished Business over Bishen Singh hung about reluctant to take his
leave and at last joining his hands and approaching Orde with bated
breath and whispering humbleness said he had a petition to make Ordes
face suddenly lost all trace of expression Speak on Bishen Singh
said he and the carver in a whining tone explained that his case
against his brothers was fixed for hearing before a native judge
andhere he dropped his voice still lower till he was summarily stopped
by Orde who sternly pointed to the gate with an emphatic Begone

Bishen Singh showing but little sign of discomposure salaamed
respectfully to the friends and departed

Pagett looked inquiry Orde with complete recovery of his usual
urbanity replied Its nothing only the old story he wants his case
to be tried by an English judgethey all do thatbut when he began
to hint that the other side were in improper relations with the native
judge I had to shut him up Gunga Ram the man he wanted to make
insinuations about may not be very bright but hes as honest as
daylight on the bench But thats just what one cant get a native to
believe

Do you really mean to say these people prefer to have their cases tried
by English judges

Why certainly

Pagett drew a long breath I didnt know that before At this point a
phaeton entered the compound and Orde rose with Confound it theres
old Rasul Ali Khan come to pay one of his tiresome duty calls Im
afraid we shall never get through our little Congress discussion

Pagett was an almost silent spectator of the grave formalities of
a visit paid by a punctilious old Mahommedan gentleman to an Indian
official and was much impressed by the distinction of manner and fine
appearance of the Mohammedan landholder When the exchange of polite
banalities came to a pause he expressed a wish to learn the courtly
visitors opinion of the National Congress

Orde reluctantly interpreted and with a smile which even Mohammedan
politeness could not save from bitter scorn Rasul Ali Khan intimated
that he knew nothing about it and cared still less It was a kind of
talk encouraged by the Government for some mysterious purpose of its
own and for his own part he wondered and held his peace

Pagett was far from satisfied with this and wished to have the old
gentlemans opinion on the propriety of managing all Indian affairs on
the basis of an elective system

Orde did his best to explain but it was plain the visitor was bored
and bewildered Frankly he didnt think much of committees they had
a Municipal Committee at Lahore and had elected a menial servant an
orderly as a member He had been informed of this on good authority
and after that committees had ceased to interest him But all was
according to the rule of Government and please God it was all for the
best

What an old fossil it is cried Pagett as Orde returned from seeing
his guest to the door just like some old blueblooded hidalgo of
Spain What does he really think of the Congress after all and of the
elective system

Hates it all like poison When you are sure of a majority election
is a fine system but you can scarcely expect the Mahommedans the most
masterful and powerful minority in the country to contemplate their own
extinction with joy The worst of it is that he and his coreligionists
who are many and the landed proprietors also of Hindu race are
frightened and put out by this election business and by the importance
we have bestowed on lawyers pleaders writers and the like who have
up to now been in abject submission to them They say little but
after all they are the most important fagots in the great bundle of
communities and all the glib bunkum in the world would not pay for
their estrangement They have controlled the land

But I am assured that experience of local selfgovernment in your
municipalities has been most satisfactory and when once the principle
is accepted in your centres dont you know it is bound to spread and
these importantahpeople of yours would learn it like the rest I see
no difficulty at all and the smooth lips closed with the complacent
snap habitual to Pagett MP the man of cheerful yesterdays and
confident tomorrows

Orde looked at him with a dreary smile

The privilege of election has been most reluctantly withdrawn from
scores of municipalities others have had to be summarily suppressed
and outside the Presidency towns the actual work done has been badly
performed This is of less moment perhapsit only sends up the
local deathratesthan the fact that the public interest in municipal
elections never very strong has waned and is waning in spite of
careful nursing on the part of Government servants

Can you explain this lack of interest said Pagett putting aside the
rest of Ordes remarks

You may find a ward of the key in the fact that only one in every
thousand of our population can spell Then they are infinitely more
interested in religion and caste questions than in any sort of politics
When the business of mere existence is over their minds are occupied by
a series of interests pleasures rituals superstitions and the like
based on centuries of tradition and usage You perhaps find it hard to
conceive of people absolutely devoid of curiosity to whom the book the
daily paper and the printed speech are unknown and you would describe
their life as blank Thats a profound mistake You are in another
land another century down on the bedrock of society where the family
merely and not the community is allimportant The average Oriental
cannot be brought to look beyond his clan His life too is more
complete and selfsufficing and less sordid and lowthoughted than you
might imagine It is bovine and slow in some respects but it is never
empty You and I are inclined to put the cart before the horse and to
forget that it is the man that is elemental not the book The corn and
the cattle are all my care And the rest is the will of God Why should
such folk look up from their immemorially appointed round of duty and
interests to meddle with the unknown and fuss with votingpapers How
would you atop of all your interests care to conduct even onetenth
of your life according to the manners and customs of the Papuans lets
say Thats what it comes to

But if they wont take the trouble to vote why do you anticipate that
Mohammedans proprietors and the rest would be crushed by majorities of
them

Again Pagett disregarded the closing sentence

Because though the landholders would not move a finger on any purely
political question they could be raised in dangerous excitement by
religious hatreds Already the first note of this has been sounded by
the people who are trying to get up an agitation on the cowkilling
question and every year there is trouble over the Mohammedan Muharrum
processions

But who looks after the popular rights being thus unrepresented

The Government of Her Majesty the Queen Empress of India in which if
the Congress promoters are to be believed the people have an implicit
trust for the Congress circular specially prepared for rustic
comprehension says the movement is for the remission of tax
the advancement of Hindustan and the strengthening of the British
Government This paper is headed in large lettersMAY THE PROSPERITY
OF THE EMPIRE OF INDIA ENDURE

Really said Pagett that shows some cleverness But there are
things better worth imitation in our English methods oferpolitical
statement than this sort of amiable fraud

Anyhow resumed Orde you perceive that not a word is said about
elections and the elective principle and the reticence of the Congress
promoters here shows they are wise in their generation

But the elective principle must triumph in the end and the little
difficulties you seem to anticipate would give way on the introduction
of a wellbalanced scheme capable of indefinite extension

But is it possible to devise a scheme which always assuming that
the people took any interest in it without enormous expense ruinous
dislocation of the administration and danger to the public peace can
satisfy the aspirations of Mr Hume and his following and yet safeguard
the interests of the Mahommedans the landed and wealthy classes the
Conservative Hindus the Eurasians Parsees Sikhs Rajputs native
Christians domiciled Europeans and others who are each important and
powerful in their way

Pagetts attention however was diverted to the gate where a group of
cultivators stood in apparent hesitation

Here are the twelve Apostles by Jovecome straight out of Raffaeles
cartoons said the MP with the fresh appreciation of a newcomer

Orde loth to be interrupted turned impatiently toward the villagers
and their leader handing his long staff to one of his companions
advanced to the house

It is old Jelbo the Lumherdar or headman of Pind Sharkot and a very
intelligent man for a villager

The Jat farmer had removed his shoes and stood smiling on the edge of
the veranda His strongly marked features glowed with russet bronze and
his bright eyes gleamed under deeply set brows contracted by lifelong
exposure to sunshine His beard and moustache streaked with grey swept
from bold cliffs of brow and cheek in the large sweeps one sees drawn
by Michael Angelo and strands of long black hair mingled with the
irregularly piled wreaths and folds of his turban The drapery of stout
blue cotton cloth thrown over his broad shoulders and girt round his
narrow loins hung from his tall form in broadly sculptured folds
and he would have made a superb model for an artist in search of a
patriarch

Orde greeted him cordially and after a polite pause the countryman
started off with a long story told with impressive earnestness Orde
listened and smiled interrupting the speaker at times to argue and
reason with him in a tone which Pagett could hear was kindly and
finally checking the flux of words was about to dismiss him when Pagett
suggested that he should be asked about the National Congress

But Jelbo had never heard of it He was a poor man and such things by
the favor of his Honor did not concern him

Whats the matter with your big friend that he was so terribly in
earnest asked Pagett when he had left

Nothing much He wants the blood of the people in the next village who
have had smallpox and cattle plague pretty badly and by the help of
a wizard a currier and several pigs have passed it on to his own
village Wants to know if they cant be run in for this awful crime
It seems they made a dreadful charivari at the village boundary threw a
quantity of spellbearing objects over the border a buffalos skull and
other things then branded a chamurwhat you would call a currieron
his hinder parts and drove him and a number of pigs over into Jelbos
village Jelbo says he can bring evidence to prove that the wizard
directing these proceedings who is a Sansi has been guilty of theft
arson cattlekilling perjury and murder but would prefer to have him
punished for bewitching them and inflicting smallpox

And how on earth did you answer such a lunatic

Lunaticthe old fellow is as sane as you or I and he has some ground
of complaint against those Sansis I asked if he would like a native
superintendent of police with some men to make inquiries but he
objected on the grounds the police were rather worse than smallpox and
criminal tribes put together

Criminal tribeserI dont quite understand said Pagett

We have in India many tribes of people who in the slack antiBritish
days became robbers in various kind and preyed on the people They are
being restrained and reclaimed little by little and in time will become
useful citizens but they still cherish hereditary traditions of
crime and are a difficult lot to deal with By the way what about the
political rights of these folk under your schemes The country people
call them vermin but I suppose they would be electors with the rest

Nonsensespecial provision would be made for them in a wellconsidered
electoral scheme and they would doubtless be treated with fitting
severity said Pagett with a magisterial air

Severity yesbut whether it would be fitting is doubtful Even those
poor devils have rights and after all they only practice what they
have been taught

But criminals Orde

Yes criminals with codes and rituals of crime gods and godlings of
crime and a hundred songs and sayings in praise of it Puzzling isnt
it

Its simply dreadful They ought to be put down at once Are there many
of them

Not more than about sixty thousand in this province for many of the
tribes broadly described as criminal are really vagabond and criminal
only on occasion while others are being settled and reclaimed They are
of great antiquity a legacy from the past the golden glorious
Aryan past of Max Muller Birdwood and the rest of your spindrift
philosophers

An orderly brought a card to Orde who took it with a movement of
irritation at the interruption and banded it to Pagett a large card
with a ruled border in red ink and in the centre in schoolboy copper
plate Mr Dma Nath Give salaam said the civilian and there
entered in haste a slender youth clad in a closely fitting coat of grey
homespun tight trousers patentleather shoes and a small black velvet
cap His thin cheek twitched and his eyes wandered restlessly for the
young man was evidently nervous and uncomfortable though striving to
assume a free and easy air

Your honor may perhaps remember me he said in English and Orde
scanned him keenly

I know your face somehow You belonged to the Shershah district I
think when I was in charge there

Yes Sir my father is writer at Shershah and your honor gave me a
prize when I was first in the Middle School examination five years ago
Since then I have prosecuted my studies and I am now second years
student in the Mission College

Of course you are Kedar Naths sonthe boy who said he liked
geography better than play or sugar cakes and I didnt believe you How
is your father getting on

He is well and he sends his salaam but his circumstances are
depressed and he also is down on his luck

You learn English idioms at the Mission College it seems

Yes sir they are the best idioms and my father ordered me to ask
your honor to say a word for him to the present incumbent of your
honors shoes the latchet of which he is not worthy to open and who
knows not Joseph for things are different at Shershah now and my
father wants promotion

Your father is a good man and I will do what I can for him

At this point a telegram was handed to Orde who after glancing at it
said he must leave his young friend whom he introduced to Pagett a
member of the English House of Commons who wishes to learn about India

Orde had scarcely retired with his telegram when Pagett began

Perhaps you can tell me something of the National Congress movement

Sir it is the greatest movement of modern times and one in which all
educated men like us must join All our students are for the Congress

Excepting I suppose Mahommedans and the Christians said Pagett
quick to use his recent instruction

These are some mere exceptions to the universal rule

But the people outside the College the working classes the
agriculturists your father and mother for instance

My mother said the young man with a visible effort to bring
himself to pronounce the word has no ideas and my father is not
agriculturist nor working class he is of the Kayeth caste but he had
not the advantage of a collegiate education and he does not know
much of the Congress It is a movement for the educated
youngmanconnecting adjective and noun in a sort of vocal hyphen

Ah yes said Pagett feeling he was a little off the rails and what
are the benefits you expect to gain by it

Oh sir everything England owes its greatness to Parliamentary
institutions and we should at once gain the same high position in
scale of nations Sir we wish to have the sciences the arts the
manufactures the industrial factories with steam engines and other
motive powers and public meetings and debates Already we have a
debating club in connection with the college and elect a Mr Speaker
Sir the progress must come You also are a Member of Parliament and
worship the great Lord Ripon said the youth breathlessly and his
black eyes flashed as he finished his commaless sentences

Well said Pagett drily it has not yet occurred to me to worship
his Lordship although I believe he is a very worthy man and I am not
sure that England owes quite all the things you name to the House of
Commons You see my young friend the growth of a nation like ours
is slow subject to many influences and if you have read your history
aright

Sir I know it allall Norman Conquest Magna Charta Runnymede
Reformation Tudors Stuarts Mr Milton and Mr Burke and I have
read something of Mr Herbert Spencer and Gibbons Decline and Fall
Reynolds Mysteries of the Court and

Pagett felt like one who had pulled the string of a showerbath
unawares and hastened to stop the torrent with a question as to what
particular grievances of the people of India the attention of an elected
assembly should be first directed But young Mr Dma Nath was slow to
particularize There were many very many demanding consideration Mr
Pagett would like to hear of one or two typical examples The Repeal of
the Arms Act was at last named and the student learned for the first
time that a license was necessary before an Englishman could carry a
gun in England Then natives of India ought to be allowed to become
Volunteer Riflemen if they chose and the absolute equality of the
Oriental with his European fellowsubject in civil status should be
proclaimed on principle and the Indian Army should be considerably
reduced The student was not however prepared with answers to Mr
Pagetts mildest questions on these points and he returned to vague
generalities leaving the MP so much impressed with the crudity of
his views that he was glad on Ordes return to say goodbye to his very
interesting young friend

What do you think of young India asked Orde

Curious very curiousand callow

And yet the civilian replied one can scarcely help sympathizing
with him for his mere youths sake The young orators of the Oxford
Union arrived at the same conclusions and showed doubtless just the
same enthusiasm If there were any political analogy between India and
England if the thousand races of this Empire were one if there were
any chance even of their learning to speak one language if in short
India were a Utopia of the debatingroom and not a real land this
kind of talk might be worth listening to but it is all based on false
analogy and ignorance of the facts

But he is a native and knows the facts

He is a sort of English schoolboy but married three years and the
father of two weaklings and knows less than most English schoolboys
You saw all he is and knows and such ideas as he has acquired are
directly hostile to the most cherished convictions of the vast majority
of the people

But what does he mean by saying he is a student of a mission college
Is he a Christian

He meant just what he said and he is not a Christian nor ever will
he be Good people in America Scotland and England most of whom would
never dream of collegiate education for their own sons are pinching
themselves to bestow it in pure waste on Indian youths Their scheme
is an oblique subterranean attack on heathenism the theory being that
with the jam of secular education leading to a University degree the
pill of moral or religious instruction may he coaxed down the heathen
gullet

But does it succeed do they make converts

They make no converts for the subtle Oriental swallows the jam and
rejects the pill but the mere example of the sober righteous and
godly lives of the principals and professors who are most excellent and
devoted men must have a certain moral value Yet as Lord Lansdowne
pointed out the other day the market is dangerously overstocked
with graduates of our Universities who look for employment in the
administration An immense number are employed but year by year the
college mills grind out increasing lists of youths foredoomed to
failure and disappointment and meanwhile trades manufactures and the
industrial arts are neglected and in fact regarded with contempt by our
new literary mandarins in posse

But our young friend said he wanted steamengines and factories said
Pagett

Yes he would like to direct such concerns He wants to begin at the
top for manual labor is held to be discreditable and he would never
defile his hands by the apprenticeship which the architects engineers
and manufacturers of England cheerfully undergo and he would be aghast
to learn that the leading names of industrial enterprise in England
belonged a generation or two since or now belong to men who wrought
with their own hands And though he talks glibly of manufacturers he
refuses to see that the Indian manufacturer of the future will be the
despised workman of the present It was proposed for example a few
weeks ago that a certain municipality in this province should establish
an elementary technical school for the sons of workmen The stress of
the opposition to the plan came from a pleader who owed all he had to a
college education bestowed on him gratis by Government and missions
You would have fancied some fine old crusted Tory squire of the last
generation was speaking These people he said want no education
for they learn their trades from their fathers and to teach a workmans
son the elements of mathematics and physical science would give him
ideas above his business They must be kept in their place and it was
idle to imagine that there was any science in wood or iron work And he
carried his point But the Indian workman will rise in the social scale
in spite of the new literary caste

In England we have scarcely begun to realize that there is an
industrial class in this country yet I suppose the example of men
like Edwards for instance must tell said Pagett thoughtfully

That you shouldnt know much about it is natural enough for there are
but few sources of information India in this as in other respects is
like a badly kept ledgernot written up to date And men like Edwards
are in reality missionaries who by precept and example are teaching
more lessons than they know Only a few however of their crowds of
subordinates seem to care to try to emulate them and aim at individual
advancement the rest drop into the ancient Indian caste groove

How do you mean asked Pagett

Well it is found that the new railway and factory workmen the fitter
the smith the enginedriver and the rest are already forming separate
hereditary castes You may notice this down at Jamalpur in Bengal
one of the oldest railway centres and at other places and in other
industries they are following the same inexorable Indian law

Which means queried Pagett

It means that the rooted habit of the people is to gather in small
selfcontained selfsufficing family groups with no thought or care for
any interests but their owna habit which is scarcely compatible with
the right acceptation of the elective principle

Yet you must admit Orde that though our young friend was not able to
expound the faith that is in him your Indian army is too big

Not nearly big enough for its main purpose And as a side issue there
are certain powerful minorities of fighting folk whose interests an
Asiatic Government is bound to consider Arms is as much a means of
livelihood as civil employ under Government and law And it would be
a heavy strain on British bayonets to hold down Sikhs Jats Bilochis
Rohillas Rajputs Bhils Dogras Pathans and Gurkhas to abide by the
decisions of a numerical majority opposed to their interests Leave the
numerical majority to itself without the British bayonetsa flock of
sheep might as reasonably hope to manage a troop of collies

This complaint about excessive growth of the army is akin to another
contention of the Congress party They protest against the malversation
of the whole of the moneys raised by additional taxes as a Famine
Insurance Fund to other purposes You must be aware that this special
Famine Fund has all been spent on frontier roads and defences and
strategic railway schemes as a protection against Russia

But there was never a special famine fund raised by special taxation
and put by as in a box No sane administrator would dream of such
a thing In a time of prosperity a finance minister rejoicing in
a margin proposed to annually apply a million and a half to the
construction of railways and canals for the protection of districts
liable to scarcity and to the reduction of the annual loans for public
works But times were not always prosperous and the finance minister
had to choose whether he would bang up the insurance scheme for a year
or impose fresh taxation When a farmer hasnt got the little surplus
he hoped to have for buying a new wagon and draining a lowlying field
corner you dont accuse him of malversation if he spends what he has
on the necessary work of the rest of his farm

A clatter of hoofs was heard and Orde looked up with vexation but his
brow cleared as a horseman halted under the porch

Hello Orde just looked in to ask if you are coming to polo on
Tuesday we want you badly to help to crumple up the Krab Bokhar team

Orde explained that he had to go out into the District and while the
visitor complained that though good men wouldnt play duffers were
always keen and that his side would probably be beaten Pagett rose to
look at his mount a red lathered Biloch mare with a curious lyrelike
incurving of the ears Quite a little thoroughbred in all other
respects said the MP and Orde presented Mr Reginald Burke Manager
of the Siad and Sialkote Bank to his friend

Yes shes as good as they make em and shes all the female I possess
and spoiled in consequence arent you old girl said Burke patting
the mares glossy neck as she backed and plunged

Mr Pagett said Orde has been asking me about the Congress What is
your opinion Burke turned to the M P with a frank smile

Well if its all the same to you sir I should say Damn the
Congress but then Im no politician but only a business man

You find it a tiresome subject

Yes its all that and worse than that for this kind of agitation is
anything but wholesome for the country

How do you mean

It would be a long job to explain and Sara here wont stand but you
know how sensitive capital is and how timid investors are All this
sort of rot is likely to frighten them and we cant afford to frighten
them The passengers aboard an Ocean steamer dont feel reassured when
the ships way is stopped and they hear the workmens hammers tinkering
at the engines down below The old Arks going on all right as she is
and only wants quiet and room to move Thems my sentiments and those
of some other people who have to do with money and business

Then you are a thickandthin supporter of the Government as it is

Why no The Indian Government is much too timid with its moneylike
an old maiden aunt of minealways in a funk about her investments They
dont spend half enough on railways for instance and they are slow in
a general way and ought to be made to sit up in all that concerns
the encouragement of private enterprise and coaxing out into use the
millions of capital that lie dormant in the country

The mare was dancing with impatience and Burke was evidently anxious to
be off so the men wished him goodbye

Who is your genial friend who condemns both Congress and Government in
a breath asked Pagett with an amused smile

Just now he is Reggie Burke keener on polo than on anything else
but if you go to the Sind and Sialkote Bank tomorrow you would find Mr
Reginald Burke a very capable man of business known and liked by an
immense constituency North and South of this

Do you think he is right about the Governments want of enterprise

I should hesitate to say Better consult the merchants and chambers
of commerce in Cawnpore Madras Bombay and Calcutta But though these
bodies would like as Reggie puts it to make Government sit up it is
an elementary consideration in governing a country like India which
must be administered for the benefit of the people at large that the
counsels of those who resort to it for the sake of making money should
be judiciously weighed and not allowed to overpower the rest They are
welcome guests here as a matter of course but it has been found best
to restrain their influence Thus the rights of plantation laborers
factory operatives and the like have been protected and the
capitalist eager to get on has not always regarded Government action
with favor It is quite conceivable that under an elective system the
commercial communities of the great towns might find means to secure
majorities on labor questions and on financial matters

They would act at least with intelligence and consideration

Intelligence yes but as to consideration who at the present moment
most bitterly resents the tender solicitude of Lancashire for the
welfare and protection of the Indian factory operative English and
native capitalists running cotton mills and factories

But is the solicitude of Lancashire in this matter entirely
disinterested

It is no business of mine to say I merely indicate an example of how
a powerful commercial interest might hamper a Government intent in the
first place on the larger interests of humanity

Orde broke off to listen a moment Theres Dr Lathrop talking to my
wife in the drawingroom said he

Surely not thats a ladys voice and if my ears dont deceive me an
American

Exactly Dr Eva McCreery Lathrop chief of the new Womens Hospital
here and a very good fellow forbye Good morning Doctor he said as
a graceful figure came out on the veranda you seem to be in trouble I
hope Mrs Orde was able to help you

Your wife is real kind and good I always come to her when Im in a fix
but I fear its more than comforting I want

You work too hard and wear yourself out said Orde kindly Let me
introduce my friend Mr Pagett just fresh from home and anxious to
learn his India You could tell him something of that more important
half of which a mere man knows so little

Perhaps I could if Id any heart to do it but Im in trouble Ive
lost a case a case that was doing well through nothing in the world
but inattention on the part of a nurse I had begun to trust And when I
spoke only a small piece of my mind she collapsed in a whining heap on
the floor It is hopeless

The men were silent for the blue eyes of the lady doctor were dim
Recovering herself she looked up with a smile half sad half humorous
And I am in a whining heap too but what phase of Indian life are you
particularly interested in sir

Mr Pagett intends to study the political aspect of things and the
possibility of bestowing electoral institutions on the people

Wouldnt it be as much to the purpose to bestow pointlace collars
on them They need many things more urgently than votes Why its like
giving a breadpill for a broken leg

ErI dont quite follow said Pagett uneasily

Well whats the matter with this country is not in the least
political but an all round entanglement of physical social and moral
evils and corruptions all more or less due to the unnatural treatment
of women You cant gather figs from thistles and so long as the system
of infant marriage the prohibition of the remarriage of widows
the lifelong imprisonment of wives and mothers in a worse than penal
confinement and the withholding from them of any kind of education
or treatment as rational beings continues the country cant advance a
step Half of it is morally dead and worse than dead and thats just
the half from which we have a right to look for the best impulses Its
right here where the trouble is and not in any political considerations
whatsoever

But do they marry so early said Pagett vaguely

The average age is seven but thousands are married still earlier One
result is that girls of twelve and thirteen have to bear the burden
of wifehood and motherhood and as might be expected the rate of
mortality both for mothers and children is terrible Pauperism
domestic unhappiness and a low state of health are only a few of the
consequences of this Then when as frequently happens the boyhusband
dies prematurely his widow is condemned to worse than death She may
not remarry must live a secluded and despised life a life so unnatural
that she sometimes prefers suicide more often she goes astray You
dont know in England what such words as infantmarriage babywife
girlmother and virginwidow mean but they mean unspeakable
horrors here

Well but the advanced political party here will surely make it their
business to advocate social reforms as well as political ones said
Pagett

Very surely they will do no such thing said the lady doctor
emphatically I wish I could make you understand Why even of the
funds devoted to the Marchioness of Dufferins organization for medical
aid to the women of India it was said in print and in speech that they
would be better spent on more college scholarships for men And in
all the advanced parties talkGod forgive themand in all their
programmes they carefully avoid all such subjects They will talk about
the protection of the cow for thats an ancient superstitionthey
can all understand that but the protection of the women is a new and
dangerous idea She turned to Pagett impulsively

You are a member of the English Parliament Can you do nothing The
foundations of their life are rottenutterly and bestially rotten I
could tell your wife things that I couldnt tell you I know the inner
life that belongs to the native and I know nothing else and believe
me you might as well try to grow goldenrod in a mushroompit as to make
anything of a people that are born and reared as thesethese things
re The men talk of their rights and privileges I have seen the women
that bear these very men and againmay God forgive the men

Pagetts eyes opened with a large wonder Dr Lathrop rose
tempestuously

I must be off to lecture said she and Im sorry that I cant
show you my hospitals but you had better believe sir that its more
necessary for India than all the elections in creation

Thats a woman with a mission and no mistake said Pagett after a
pause

Yes she believes in her work and so do I said Orde Ive a notion
that in the end it will be found that the most helpful work done
for India in this generation was wrought by Lady Dufferin in drawing
attentionwhat work that was by the way even with her husbands great
name to back it to the needs of women here In effect native habits and
beliefs are an organized conspiracy against the laws of health and happy
lifebut there is some dawning of hope now

How dyou account for the general indifference then

I suppose its due in part to their fatalism and their utter
indifference to all human suffering How much do you imagine the great
province of the Punjab with over twenty million people and half a score
rich towns has contributed to the maintenance of civil dispensaries last
year About seven thousand rupees

Thats seven hundred pounds said Pagett quickly

I wish it was replied Orde but anyway its an absurdly inadequate
sum and shows one of the blank sides of Oriental character

Pagett was silent for a long time The question of direct and personal
pain did not lie within his researches He preferred to discuss the
weightier matters of the law and contented himself with murmuring
Theyll do better later on Then with a rush returning to his first
thought

But my dear Orde if its merely a class movement of a local and
temporary character how d you account for Bradlaugh who is at least a
man of sense taking it up

I know nothing of the champion of the New Brahmins but what I see in
the papers I suppose there is something tempting in being hailed by a
large assemblage as the representative of the aspirations of two hundred
and fifty millions of people Such a man looks through all the roaring
and the wreaths and does not reflect that it is a false perspective
which as a matter of fact hides the real complex and manifold India
from his gaze He can scarcely be expected to distinguish between the
ambitions of a new oligarchy and the real wants of the people of whom he
knows nothing But its strange that a professed Radical should come to
be the chosen advocate of a movement which has for its aim the revival
of an ancient tyranny Shows how even Radicalism can fall into academic
grooves and miss the essential truths of its own creed Believe me
Pagett to deal with India you want firsthand knowledge and experience
I wish he would come and live here for a couple of years or so

Is not this rather an ad hominem style of argument

Cant help it in a case like this Indeed I am not sure you ought not
to go further and weigh the whole character and quality and upbringing
of the man You must admit that the monumental complacency with which he
trotted out his ingenious little Constitution for India showed a strange
want of imagination and the sense of humor

No I dont quite admit it said Pagett

Well you know him and I dont but thats how it strikes a stranger
He turned on his heel and paced the veranda thoughtfully And after
all the burden of the actual daily unromantic toil falls on the
shoulders of the men out here and not on his own He enjoys all the
privileges of recommendation without responsibility and wewell
perhaps when youve seen a little more of India youll understand To
begin with our death rates five times higher than yoursI speak
now for the brutal bureaucratand we work on the refuse of workedout
cities and exhausted civilizations among the bones of the dead In the
case of the Congress meetings the only notable fact is that the priests
of the altar are British not Buddhist Jain or Brahminical and that
the whole thing is a British contrivance kept alive by the efforts of
Messrs Hume Eardley Norton and Digby

You mean to say then its not a spontaneous movement

What movement was ever spontaneous in any true sense of the word This
seems to be more factitious than usual You seem to know a great deal
about it try it by the touchstone of subscriptions a coarse but fairly
trustworthy criterion and there is scarcely the color of money in it
The delegates write from England that they are out of pocket for
working expenses railway fares and stationerythe mere pasteboard
and scaffolding of their show It is in fact collapsing from mere
financial inanition

But you cannot deny that the people of India who are perhaps too
poor to subscribe are mentally and morally moved by the agitation
Pagett insisted

That is precisely what I do deny The native side of the movement is
the work of a limited class a microscopic minority as Lord Dufferin
described it when compared with the people proper but still a very
interesting class seeing that it is of our own creation It is composed
almost entirely of those of the literary or clerkly castes who have
received an English education

Surely thats a very important class Its members must be the ordained
leaders of popular thought

Anywhere else they might be leaders but they have no social weight
here

Pagett laughed Thats an epigrammatic way of putting it Orde

Is it Lets see said the Deputy Commissioner of Amara striding into
the sunshine toward a halfnaked gardener potting roses He took the
mans hoe and went to a rainscarped bank at the bottom of the garden

Come here Pagett he said and cut at the sunbaked soil After
three strokes there rolled from under the blade of the hoe the half of a
clanking skeleton that settled at Pagetts feet in an unseemly jumble of
bones The MP drew back

Our houses are built on cemeteries said Orde There are scores of
thousands of graves within ten miles

Pagett was contemplating the skull with the awed fascination of a man
who has but little to do with the dead Indias a very curious place
said he after a pause

Ah Youll know all about it in three months Come in to lunch said
Orde





VOLUME V PLAIN TALES FROM THE HILLS




LISPETH

 Look you have cast out Love What Gods are these
 You bid me please
 The Three in One the One in Three Not so
 To my own Gods I go
 It may be they shall give me greater ease
 Than your cold Christ and tangled Trinities
 The Convert

She was the daughter of Sonoo a Hillman and Jadeh his wife One
year their maize failed and two bears spent the night in their only
poppyfield just above the Sutlej Valley on the Kotgarh side so next
season they turned Christian and brought their baby to the Mission
to be baptized The Kotgarh Chaplain christened her Elizabeth and
Lispeth is the Hill or pahari pronunciation

Later cholera came into the Kotgarh Valley and carried off Sonoo and
Jadeh and Lispeth became halfservant halfcompanion to the wife of
the then Chaplain of Kotgarh This was after the reign of the Moravian
missionaries but before Kotgarh had quite forgotten her title of
Mistress of the Northern Hills

Whether Christianity improved Lispeth or whether the gods of her own
people would have done as much for her under any circumstances I do not
know but she grew very lovely When a Hill girl grows lovely she is
worth traveling fifty miles over bad ground to look upon Lispeth had a
Greek faceone of those faces people paint so often and see so seldom
She was of a pale ivory color and for her race extremely tall Also
she possessed eyes that were wonderful and had she not been dressed in
the abominable printcloths affected by Missions you would meeting her
on the hillside unexpectedly have thought her the original Diana of
the Romans going out to slay

Lispeth took to Christianity readily and did not abandon it when she
reached womanhood as do some Hill girls Her own people hated her
because she had they said become a memsahib and washed herself daily
and the Chaplains wife did not know what to do with her Somehow
one cannot ask a stately goddess five foot ten in her shoes to clean
plates and dishes So she played with the Chaplains children and took
classes in the Sunday School and read all the books in the house and
grew more and more beautiful like the Princesses in fairy tales The
Chaplains wife said that the girl ought to take service in Simla as a
nurse or something genteel But Lispeth did not want to take service
She was very happy where she was

When travellersthere were not many in those yearscame to Kotgarh
Lispeth used to lock herself into her own room for fear they might take
her away to Simla or somewhere out into the unknown world

One day a few months after she was seventeen years old Lispeth went
out for a walk She did not walk in the manner of English ladiesa mile
and a half out and a ride back again She covered between twenty and
thirty miles in her little constitutionals all about and about between
Kotgarh and Narkunda This time she came back at full dusk stepping
down the breakneck descent into Kotgarh with something heavy in her
arms The Chaplains wife was dozing in the drawingroom when Lispeth
came in breathing hard and very exhausted with her burden Lispeth put
it down on the sofa and said simply

This is my husband I found him on the Bagi Road He has hurt himself
We will nurse him and when he is well your husband shall marry him to
me

This was the first mention Lispeth had ever made of her matrimonial
views and the Chaplains wife shrieked with horror However the man on
the sofa needed attention first He was a young Englishman and his head
had been cut to the bone by something jagged Lispeth said she had found
him down the khud so she had brought him in

He was breathing queerly and was unconscious

He was put to bed and tended by the Chaplain who knew something of
medicine and Lispeth waited outside the door in case she could be
useful She explained to the Chaplain that this was the man she meant
to marry and the Chaplain and his wife lectured her severely on the
impropriety of her conduct Lispeth listened quietly and repeated her
first proposition It takes a great deal of Christianity to wipe out
uncivilized Eastern instincts such as falling in love at first sight
Lispeth having found the man she worshipped did not see why she should
keep silent as to her choice She had no intention of being sent away
either She was going to nurse that Englishman until he was well enough
to marry her This was her little programme

After a fortnight of slight fever and inflammation the Englishman
recovered coherence and thanked the Chaplain and his wife and
Lispethespecially Lispethfor their kindness He was a traveller in
the East he saidthey never talked about globetrotters in those
days when the P  O fleet was young and smalland had come from
Dehra Dun to hunt for plants and butterflies among the Simla hills No
one at Simla therefore knew anything about him He fancied he must
have fallen over the cliff while stalking a fern on a rotten treetrunk
and that his coolies must have stolen his baggage and fled He thought
he would go back to Simla when he was a little stronger He desired no
more mountaineering

He made small haste to go away and recovered his strength slowly

Lispeth objected to being advised either by the Chaplain or his wife
so the latter spoke to the Englishman and told him how matters stood in
Lispeths heart He laughed a good deal and said it was very pretty and
romantic a perfect idyl of the Himalayas but as he was engaged to a
girl at Home he fancied that nothing would happen Certainly he would
behave with discretion He did that Still he found it very pleasant to
talk to Lispeth and walk with Lispeth and say nice things to her and
call her pet names while he was getting strong enough to go away It
meant nothing at all to him and everything in the world to Lispeth She
was very happy while the fortnight lasted because she had found a man
to love

Being a savage by birth she took no trouble to hide her feelings and
the Englishman was amused When he went away Lispeth walked with him
up the Hill as far as Narkunda very troubled and very miserable The
Chaplains wife being a good Christian and disliking anything in
the shape of fuss or scandalLispeth was beyond her management
entirelyhad told the Englishman to tell Lispeth that he was coming
back to marry her She is but a child you know and I fear at heart
a heathen said the Chaplains wife So all the twelve miles up the
hill the Englishman with his arm around Lispeths waist was assuring
the girl that he would come back and marry her and Lispeth made him
promise over and over again She wept on the Narkunda Ridge till he had
passed out of sight along the Muttiani path

Then she dried her tears and went in to Kotgarh again and said to the
Chaplains wife He will come back and marry me He has gone to his
own people to tell them so And the Chaplains wife soothed Lispeth
and said He will come back At the end of two months Lispeth grew
impatient and was told that the Englishman had gone over the seas
to England She knew where England was because she had read little
geography primers but of course she had no conception of the nature
of the sea being a Hill girl

There was an old puzzlemap of the World in the House Lispeth had
played with it when she was a child She unearthed it again and put it
together of evenings and cried to herself and tried to imagine where
her Englishman was As she had no ideas of distance or steamboats
her notions were somewhat erroneous It would not have made the least
difference had she been perfectly correct for the Englishman had no
intention of coming back to marry a Hill girl He forgot all about her
by the time he was butterflyhunting in Assam He wrote a book on the
East afterwards Lispeths name did not appear

At the end of three months Lispeth made daily pilgrimage to Narkunda
to see if her Englishman was coming along the road It gave her comfort
and the Chaplains wife finding her happier thought that she was
getting over her barbarous and most indelicate folly A little later
the walks ceased to help Lispeth and her temper grew very bad The
Chaplains wife thought this a profitable time to let her know the real
state of affairsthat the Englishman had only promised his love to keep
her quietthat he had never meant anything and that it was wrong and
improper of Lispeth to think of marriage with an Englishman who was of
a superior clay besides being promised in marriage to a girl of his own
people Lispeth said that all this was clearly impossible because he
had said he loved her and the Chaplains wife had with her own lips
asserted that the Englishman was coming back

How can what he and you said be untrue asked Lispeth

We said it as an excuse to keep you quiet child said the Chaplains
wife

Then you have lied to me said Lispeth you and he

The Chaplains wife bowed her head and said nothing Lispeth was
silent too for a little time then she went out down the valley and
returned in the dress of a Hill girlinfamously dirty but without the
nose and ear rings She had her hair braided into the long pigtail
helped out with black thread that Hill women wear

I am going back to my own people said she You have killed Lispeth
There is only left old Jadehs daughterthe daughter of a pahari and
the servant of Tarka Devi You are all liars you English

By the time that the Chaplains wife had recovered from the shock of the
announcement that Lispeth had verted to her mothers gods the girl had
gone and she never came back

She took to her own unclean people savagely as if to make up the
arrears of the life she had stepped out of and in a little time she
married a woodcutter who beat her after the manner of paharis and her
beauty faded soon

There is no law whereby you can account for the vagaries of the
heathen said the Chaplains wife and I believe that Lispeth was
always at heart an infidel Seeing she had been taken into the Church
of England at the mature age of five weeks this statement does not do
credit to the Chaplains wife

Lispeth was a very old woman when she died She always had a perfect
command of English and when she was sufficiently drunk could sometimes
be induced to tell the story of her first loveaffair

It was hard then to realize that the bleared wrinkled creature so
like a wisp of charred rag could ever have been Lispeth of the Kotgarh
Mission




THREE ANDAN EXTRA

 When halter and heel ropes are slipped do not give chase with
 sticks but with gram Punjabi Proverb

After marriage arrives a reaction sometimes a big sometimes a little
one but it comes sooner or later and must be tided over by both
parties if they desire the rest of their lives to go with the current

In the case of the CusackBremmils this reaction did not set in till the
third year after the wedding Bremmil was hard to hold at the best
of times but he was a beautiful husband until the baby died and Mrs
Bremmil wore black and grew thin and mourned as if the bottom of the
universe had fallen out Perhaps Bremmil ought to have comforted her He
tried to do so I think but the more he comforted the more Mrs Bremmil
grieved and consequently the more uncomfortable Bremmil grew The
fact was that they both needed a tonic And they got it Mrs Bremmil
can afford to laugh now but it was no laughing matter to her at the
time

You see Mrs Hauksbee appeared on the horizon and where she existed
was fair chance of trouble At Simla her byename was the Stormy
Petrel She had won that title five times to my own certain knowledge
She was a little brown thin almost skinny woman with big rolling
violetblue eyes and the sweetest manners in the world You had only to
mention her name at afternoon teas for every woman in the room to rise
up and call herwellNOT blessed She was clever witty brilliant
and sparkling beyond most of her kind but possessed of many devils of
malice and mischievousness She could be nice though even to her own
sex But that is another story

Bremmil went off at score after the babys death and the general
discomfort that followed and Mrs Hauksbee annexed him She took no
pleasure in hiding her captives She annexed him publicly and saw that
the public saw it He rode with her and walked with her and talked
with her and picnicked with her and tiffined at Pelitis with her
till people put up their eyebrows and said Shocking Mrs Bremmil
stayed at home turning over the dead babys frocks and crying into the
empty cradle She did not care to do anything else But some eight dear
affectionate ladyfriends explained the situation at length to her in
case she should miss the cream of it Mrs Bremmil listened quietly
and thanked them for their good offices She was not as clever as Mrs
Hauksbee but she was no fool She kept her own counsel and did not
speak to Bremmil of what she had heard This is worth remembering
Speaking to or crying over a husband never did any good yet

When Bremmil was at home which was not often he was more affectionate
than usual and that showed his hand The affection was forced partly to
soothe his own conscience and partly to soothe Mrs Bremmil It failed
in both regards

Then the ADC in Waiting was commanded by Their Excellencies Lord
and Lady Lytton to invite Mr and Mrs CusackBremmil to Peterhoff on
July 26th at 930 P MDancing in the bottomlefthand corner

I cant go said Mrs Bremmil it is too soon after poor little
Florriebut it need not stop you Tom

She meant what she said then and Bremmil said that he would go just to
put in an appearance Here he spoke the thing which was not and Mrs
Bremmil knew it She guesseda womans guess is much more accurate than
a mans certaintythat he had meant to go from the first and with Mrs
Hauksbee She sat down to think and the outcome of her thoughts was
that the memory of a dead child was worth considerably less than the
affections of a living husband

She made her plan and staked her all upon it In that hour she
discovered that she knew Tom Bremmil thoroughly and this knowledge she
acted on

Tom said she I shall be dining out at the Longmores on the evening
of the 26th Youd better dine at the club

This saved Bremmil from making an excuse to get away and dine with
Mrs Hauksbee so he was grateful and felt small and mean at the same
timewhich was wholesome Bremmil left the house at five for a ride
About halfpast five in the evening a large leathercovered basket came
in from Phelps for Mrs Bremmil She was a woman who knew how to dress
and she had not spent a week on designing that dress and having it
gored and hemmed and herringboned and tucked and rucked or whatever
the terms are for nothing It was a gorgeous dressslight mourning I
cant describe it but it was what The Queen calls a creationa thing
that hit you straight between the eyes and made you gasp She had not
much heart for what she was going to do but as she glanced at the long
mirror she had the satisfaction of knowing that she had never looked so
well in her life She was a large blonde and when she chose carried
herself superbly

After the dinner at the Longmores she went on to the dancea little
lateand encountered Bremmil with Mrs Hauksbee on his arm

That made her flush and as the men crowded round her for dances she
looked magnificent She filled up all her dances except three and those
she left blank Mrs Hauksbee caught her eye once and she knew it was
warreal warbetween them She started handicapped in the struggle
for she had ordered Bremmil about just the least little bit in the world
too much and he was beginning to resent it Moreover he had never seen
his wife look so lovely

He stared at her from doorways and glared at her from passages as she
went about with her partners and the more he stared the more taken was
he He could scarcely believe that this was the woman with the red eyes
and the black stuff gown who used to weep over the eggs at breakfast

Mrs Hauksbee did her best to hold him in play but after two dances
he crossed over to his wife and asked for a dance

Im afraid youve come too late MISTER Bremmil she said with her
eyes twinkling

Then he begged her to give him a dance and as a great favor she
allowed him the fifth waltz Luckily it stood vacant on his programme
They danced it together and there was a little flutter round the room
Bremmil had a sort of notion that his wife could dance but he never
knew she danced so divinely At the end of that waltz he asked for
anotheras a favor not as a right and Mrs Bremmil said Show me
your programme dear He showed it as a naughty little schoolboy hands
up contraband sweets to a master

There was a fair sprinkling of H on it besides H at supper

Mrs Bremmil said nothing but she smiled contemptuously ran her pencil
through 7 and 9two Hsand returned the card with her own name
written abovea pet name that only she and her husband used Then she
shook her finger at him and said laughing Oh you silly SILLY boy

Mrs Hauksbee heard that andshe owned as muchfelt that she had the
worst of it Bremmil accepted 7 and 9 gratefully They danced 7 and
sat out 9 in one of the little tents What Bremmil said and what Mrs
Bremmil said is no concern of any ones

When the band struck up The Roast Beef of Old England the two went
out into the verandah and Bremmil began looking for his wifes dandy
this was before rickshaw days while she went into the cloakroom
Mrs Hauksbee came up and said You take me in to supper I think Mr
Bremmil Bremmil turned red and looked foolish Ahhm Im going
home with my wife Mrs Hauksbee I think there has been a little
mistake Being a man he spoke as though Mrs Hauksbee were entirely
responsible

Mrs Bremmil came out of the cloakroom in a swansdown cloak with a
white cloud round her head She looked radiant and she had a right
to

The couple went off in the darkness together Bremmil riding very close
to the dandy

Then says Mrs Hauksbee to meshe looked a trifle faded and jaded in
the lamplight Take my word for it the silliest woman can manage a
clever man but it needs a very clever woman to manage a fool

Then we went in to supper




THROWN AWAY

 And some are sulky while some will plunge
 So ho Steady Stand still you
 Some you must gentle and some you must lunge
 There There Who wants to kill you
 Somethere are losses in every trade
 Will break their hearts ere bitted and made
 Will fight like fiends as the rope cuts hard
 And die dumbmad in the breakingyard
 Toolungala Stockyard Chorus

To rear a boy under what parents call the sheltered life system is if
the boy must go into the world and fend for himself not wise Unless he
be one in a thousand he has certainly to pass through many unnecessary
troubles and may possibly come to extreme grief simply from ignorance
of the proper proportions of things

Let a puppy eat the soap in the bathroom or chew a newlyblacked boot
He chews and chuckles until by and by he finds out that blacking and
Old Brown Windsor make him very sick so he argues that soap and boots
are not wholesome Any old dog about the house will soon show him the
unwisdom of biting big dogs ears Being young he remembers and goes
abroad at six months a wellmannered little beast with a chastened
appetite If he had been kept away from boots and soap and big dogs
till he came to the trinity fullgrown and with developed teeth just
consider how fearfully sick and thrashed he would be Apply that motion
to the sheltered life and see how it works It does not sound pretty
but it is the better of two evils

There was a Boy once who had been brought up under the sheltered life
theory and the theory killed him dead He stayed with his people all
his days from the hour he was born till the hour he went into Sandhurst
nearly at the top of the list He was beautifully taught in all that
wins marks by a private tutor and carried the extra weight of never
having given his parents an hours anxiety in his life What he learnt
at Sandhurst beyond the regular routine is of no great consequence
He looked about him and he found soap and blacking so to speak very
good He ate a little and came out of Sandhurst not so high as he went
in

Them there was an interval and a scene with his people who expected
much from him Next a year of living unspotted from the world in a
thirdrate depot battalion where all the juniors were children and all
the seniors old women and lastly he came out to India where he was cut
off from the support of his parents and had no one to fall back on in
time of trouble except himself

Now India is a place beyond all others where one must not take things
too seriouslythe midday sun always excepted Too much work and too
much energy kill a man just as effectively as too much assorted vice or
too much drink Flirtation does not matter because every one is being
transferred and either you or she leave the Station and never return
Good work does not matter because a man is judged by his worst output
and another man takes all the credit of his best as a rule Bad work
does not matter because other men do worse and incompetents hang on
longer in India than anywhere else Amusements do not matter because
you must repeat them as soon as you have accomplished them once and
most amusements only mean trying to win another persons money

Sickness does not matter because its all in the days work and if you
die another man takes over your place and your office in the eight
hours between death and burial Nothing matters except Home furlough
and acting allowances and these only because they are scarce This is a
slack kutcha country where all men work with imperfect instruments and
the wisest thing is to take no one and nothing in earnest but to escape
as soon as ever you can to some place where amusement is amusement and a
reputation worth the having

But this Boythe tale is as old as the Hillscame out and took all
things seriously He was pretty and was petted He took the pettings
seriously and fretted over women not worth saddling a pony to call
upon He found his new free life in India very good

It DOES look attractive in the beginning from a Subalterns point of
viewall ponies partners dancing and so on He tasted it as the
puppy tastes the soap Only he came late to the eating with a growing
set of teeth He had no sense of balancejust like the puppyand could
not understand why he was not treated with the consideration he received
under his fathers roof This hurt his feelings

He quarrelled with other boys and being sensitive to the marrow
remembered these quarrels and they excited him He found whist and
gymkhanas and things of that kind meant to amuse one after office
good but he took them seriously too just as he took the head that
followed after drink He lost his money over whist and gymkhanas because
they were new to him

He took his losses seriously and wasted as much energy and interest
over a twogoldmohur race for maiden ekkaponies with their manes
hogged as if it had been the Derby Onehalf of this came from
inexperiencemuch as the puppy squabbles with the corner of the
hearthrugand the other half from the dizziness bred by stumbling out
of his quiet life into the glare and excitement of a livelier one No
one told him about the soap and the blacking because an average man
takes it for granted that an average man is ordinarily careful in regard
to them It was pitiful to watch The Boy knocking himself to pieces as
an overhandled colt falls down and cuts himself when he gets away from
the groom

This unbridled license in amusements not worth the trouble of breaking
line for much less rioting over endured for six monthsall through
one cold weatherand then we thought that the heat and the knowledge
of having lost his money and health and lamed his horses would sober
The Boy down and he would stand steady In ninetynine cases out of a
hundred this would have happened You can see the principle working in
any Indian Station But this particular case fell through because The
Boy was sensitive and took things seriouslyas I may have said some
seven times before Of course we couldnt tell how his excesses struck
him personally

They were nothing very heartbreaking or above the average He might be
crippled for life financially and want a little nursing

Still the memory of his performances would wither away in one hot
weather and the shroff would help him to tide over the money troubles
But he must have taken another view altogether and have believed himself
ruined beyond redemption His Colonel talked to him severely when the
cold weather ended That made him more wretched than ever and it was
only an ordinary Colonels wigging

What follows is a curious instance of the fashion in which we are all
linked together and made responsible for one another THE thing that
kicked the beam in The Boys mind was a remark that a woman made when he
was talking to her There is no use in repeating it for it was only a
cruel little sentence rapped out before thinking that made him flush
to the roots of his hair He kept himself to himself for three days and
then put in for two days leave to go shooting near a Canal Engineers
Rest House about thirty miles out He got his leave and that night
at Mess was noisier and more offensive than ever He said that he was
going to shoot big game and left at halfpast ten oclock in an ekka

Partridgewhich was the only thing a man could get near the Rest
Houseis not big game so every one laughed

Next morning one of the Majors came in from short leave and heard
that The Boy had gone out to shoot big game The Major had taken an
interest in The Boy and had more than once tried to check him in
the cold weather The Major put up his eyebrows when he heard of the
expedition and went to The Boys room where he rummaged

Presently he came out and found me leaving cards on the Mess

There was no one else in the anteroom

He said The Boy has gone out shooting DOES a man shoot missing with
a revolver and a writingcase

I said Nonsense Major for I saw what was in his mind

He said Nonsense or nonsense Im going to the Canal nowat once I
dont feel easy

Then he thought for a minute and said Can you lie

You know best I answered Its my profession

Very well said the Major you must come out with me nowat
oncein an ekka to the Canal to shoot blackbuck Go and put on
shikarkitquickand drive here with a gun

The Major was a masterful man and I knew that he would not give orders
for nothing So I obeyed and on return found the Major packed up in an
ekkaguncases and food slung belowall ready for a shootingtrip

He dismissed the driver and drove himself We jogged along quietly
while in the station but as soon as we got to the dusty road across the
plains he made that pony fly A countrybred can do nearly anything at
a pinch We covered the thirty miles in under three hours but the poor
brute was nearly dead

Once I said Whats the blazing hurry Major

He said quietly The Boy has been alone by himself forone two
fivefourteen hours now I tell you I dont feel easy

This uneasiness spread itself to me and I helped to beat the pony

When we came to the Canal Engineers Rest House the Major called for The
Boys servant but there was no answer Then we went up to the house
calling for The Boy by name but there was no answer

Oh hes out shooting said I

Just then I saw through one of the windows a little hurricanelamp
burning This was at four in the afternoon We both stopped dead in the
verandah holding our breath to catch every sound and we heard inside
the room the brrbrrbrr of a multitude of flies The Major said
nothing but he took off his helmet and we entered very softly

The Boy was dead on the charpoy in the centre of the bare limewashed
room He had shot his head nearly to pieces with his revolver The
guncases were still strapped so was the bedding and on the table lay
The Boys writingcase with photographs He had gone away to die like a
poisoned rat

The Major said to himself softly Poor Boy Poor POOR devil Then he
turned away from the bed and said I want your help in this business

Knowing The Boy was dead by his own hand I saw exactly what that help
would be so I passed over to the table took a chair lit a cheroot
and began to go through the writingcase the Major looking over my
shoulder and repeating to himself We came too lateLike a rat in a
holePoor POOR devil

The Boy must have spent half the night in writing to his people and to
his Colonel and to a girl at Home and as soon as he had finished must
have shot himself for he had been dead a long time when we came in

I read all that he had written and passed over each sheet to the Major
as I finished it

We saw from his accounts how very seriously he had taken everything
He wrote about disgrace which he was unable to bearindelible
shamecriminal follywasted life and so on besides a lot of
private things to his Father and Mother too much too sacred to put into
print The letter to the girl at Home was the most pitiful of all and
I choked as I read it The Major made no attempt to keep dryeyed
I respected him for that He read and rocked himself to and fro and
simply cried like a woman without caring to hide it The letters were so
dreary and hopeless and touching We forgot all about The Boys follies
and only thought of the poor Thing on the charpoy and the scrawled
sheets in our hands It was utterly impossible to let the letters go
Home

They would have broken his Fathers heart and killed his Mother after
killing her belief in her son

At last the Major dried his eyes openly and said Nice sort of thing
to spring on an English family What shall we do

I said knowing what the Major had brought me but for The Boy died
of cholera We were with him at the time We cant commit ourselves to
halfmeasures Come along

Then began one of the most grimy comic scenes I have ever taken part
inthe concoction of a big written lie bolstered with evidence to
soothe The Boys people at Home I began the rough draft of a letter
the Major throwing in hints here and there while he gathered up all the
stuff that The Boy had written and burnt it in the fireplace It was a
hot still evening when we began and the lamp burned very badly In due
course I got the draft to my satisfaction setting forth how The Boy was
the pattern of all virtues beloved by his regiment with every promise
of a great career before him and so on how we had helped him through
the sicknessit was no time for little lies you will understandand
how he had died without pain I choked while I was putting down these
things and thinking of the poor people who would read them

Then I laughed at the grotesqueness of the affair and the laughter
mixed itself up with the chokeand the Major said that we both wanted
drinks

I am afraid to say how much whiskey we drank before the letter was
finished It had not the least effect on us Then we took off The Boys
watch locket and rings

Lastly the Major said We must send a lock of hair too A woman values
that

But there were reasons why we could not find a lock fit to send

The Boy was blackhaired and so was the Major luckily I cut off a
piece of the Majors hair above the temple with a knife and put it into
the packet we were making The laughingfit and the chokes got hold of
me again and I had to stop The Major was nearly as bad and we both
knew that the worst part of the work was to come

We sealed up the packet photographs locket seals ring letter and
lock of hair with The Boys sealingwax and The Boys seal

Then the Major said For Gods sake lets get outsideaway from the
roomand think

We went outside and walked on the banks of the Canal for an hour
eating and drinking what we had with us until the moon rose I know now
exactly how a murderer feels Finally we forced ourselves back to the
room with the lamp and the Other Thing in it and began to take up
the next piece of work I am not going to write about this It was too
horrible We burned the bedstead and dropped the ashes into the Canal
we took up the matting of the room and treated that in the same way
I went off to a village and borrowed two big hoesI did not want the
villagers to helpwhile the Major arrangedthe other matters It took
us four hours hard work to make the grave As we worked we argued out
whether it was right to say as much as we remembered of the Burial of
the Dead

We compromised things by saying the Lords Prayer with a private
unofficial prayer for the peace of the soul of The Boy Then we filled
in the grave and went into the verandahnot the houseto lie down to
sleep We were deadtired

When we woke the Major said wearily We cant go back till tomorrow
We must give him a decent time to die in He died early THIS morning
remember That seems more natural So the Major must have been lying
awake all the time thinking

I said Then why didnt we bring the body back to the cantonments

The Major thought for a minuteBecause the people bolted when they
heard of the cholera And the ekka has gone

That was strictly true We had forgotten all about the ekkapony and he
had gone home

So we were left there alone all that stifling day in the Canal Rest
House testing and retesting our story of The Boys death to see if it
was weak at any point A native turned up in the afternoon but we said
that a Sahib was dead of cholera and he ran away As the dusk gathered
the Major told me all his fears about The Boy and awful stories of
suicide or nearlycarriedout suicidetales that made ones hair crisp
He said that he himself had once gone into the same Valley of the Shadow
as the Boy when he was young and new to the country so he understood
how things fought together in The Boys poor jumbled head He also said
that youngsters in their repentant moments consider their sins much
more serious and ineffaceable than they really are We talked together
all through the evening and rehearsed the story of the death of The
Boy As soon as the moon was up and The Boy theoretically just
buried we struck across country for the Station We walked from eight
till six oclock in the morning but though we were deadtired we did
not forget to go to The Boys room and put away his revolver with the
proper amount of cartridges in the pouch Also to set his writingcase
on the table We found the Colonel and reported the death feeling more
like murderers than ever Then we went to bed and slept the clock round
for there was no more in us

The tale had credence as long as was necessary for every one forgot
about The Boy before a fortnight was over Many people however found
time to say that the Major had behaved scandalously in not bringing in
the body for a regimental funeral The saddest thing of all was a letter
from The Boys mother to the Major and mewith big inky blisters all
over the sheet She wrote the sweetest possible things about our great
kindness and the obligation she would be under to us as long as she
lived

All things considered she WAS under an obligation but not exactly as
she meant




MISS YOUGHALS SAIS

 When Man and Woman are agreed what can the Kazi do Mahomedan
 Proverb

Some people say that there is no romance in India Those people are
wrong Our lives hold quite as much romance as is good for us

Sometimes more

Strickland was in the Police and people did not understand him so
they said he was a doubtful sort of man and passed by on the other side
Strickland had himself to thank for this He held the extraordinary
theory that a Policeman in India should try to know as much about the
natives as the natives themselves Now in the whole of Upper India
there is only ONE man who can pass for Hindu or Mohammedan chamar or
faquir as he pleases He is feared and respected by the natives from
the Ghor Kathri to the Jamma Musjid and he is supposed to have the gift
of invisibility and executive control over many Devils But what good
has this done him with the Government None in the world He has never
got Simla for his charge and his name is almost unknown to Englishmen

Strickland was foolish enough to take that man for his model and
following out his absurd theory dabbled in unsavory places no
respectable man would think of exploringall among the native
riffraff He educated himself in this peculiar way for seven years and
people could not appreciate it He was perpetually going Fantee among
the natives which of course no man with any sense believes in He was
initiated into the Sat Bhai at Allahabad once when he was on leave he
knew the LizardSong of the Sansis and the HalliHukk dance which is
a religious cancan of a startling kind When a man knows who dances the
HalliHukk and how and when and where he knows something to be proud
of He has gone deeper than the skin But Strickland was not proud
though he had helped once at Jagadhri at the Painting of the Death
Bull which no Englishman must even look upon had mastered the
thievespatter of the changars had taken a Eusufzai horsethief alone
near Attock and had stood under the mimbarboard of a Border mosque and
conducted service in the manner of a Sunni Mollah

His crowning achievement was spending eleven days as a faquir in the
gardens of Baba Atal at Amritsar and there picking up the threads of
the great Nasiban Murder Case But people said justly enough Why on
earth cant Strickland sit in his office and write up his diary and
recruit and keep quiet instead of showing up the incapacity of his
seniors So the Nasiban Murder Case did him no good departmentally
but after his first feeling of wrath he returned to his outlandish
custom of prying into native life By the way when a man once acquires
a taste for this particular amusement it abides with him all his days
It is the most fascinating thing in the world Love not excepted Where
other men took ten days to the Hills Strickland took leave for what
he called shikar put on the disguise that appealed to him at the time
stepped down into the brown crowd and was swallowed up for a while He
was a quiet dark young fellowspare blackeyesand when he was not
thinking of something else a very interesting companion Strickland
on Native Progress as he had seen it was worth hearing Natives hated
Strickland but they were afraid of him He knew too much

When the Youghals came into the station Stricklandvery gravely as he
did everythingfell in love with Miss Youghal and she after a
while fell in love with him because she could not understand him Then
Strickland told the parents but Mrs Youghal said she was not going to
throw her daughter into the worst paid Department in the Empire and old
Youghal said in so many words that he mistrusted Stricklands ways
and works and would thank him not to speak or write to his daughter
any more Very well said Strickland for he did not wish to make
his ladyloves life a burden After one long talk with Miss Youghal he
dropped the business entirely

The Youghals went up to Simla in April

In July Strickland secured three months leave on urgent private
affairs He locked up his housethough not a native in the Providence
would wittingly have touched Estreekin Sahibs gear for the worldand
went down to see a friend of his an old dyer at Tarn Taran

Here all trace of him was lost until a sais met me on the Simla Mall
with this extraordinary note

Dear old man

Please give bearer a box of cherootsSupers No I for preference
They are freshest at the Club Ill repay when I reappear but at
present Im out of Society

Yours

E STRICKLAND

I ordered two boxes and handed them over to the sais with my love

That sais was Strickland and he was in old Youghals employ attached
to Miss Youghals Arab The poor fellow was suffering for an English
smoke and knew that whatever happened I should hold my tongue till the
business was over

Later on Mrs Youghal who was wrapped up in her servants began
talking at houses where she called of her paragon among saisesthe man
who was never too busy to get up in the morning and pick flowers for
the breakfasttable and who blackedactually BLACKEDthe hoofs of his
horse like a London coachman The turnout of Miss Youghals Arab was a
wonder and a delight StricklandDulloo I meanfound his reward
in the pretty things that Miss Youghal said to him when she went out
riding Her parents were pleased to find she had forgotten all her
foolishness for young Strickland and said she was a good girl

Strickland vows that the two months of his service were the most rigid
mental discipline he has ever gone through Quite apart from the little
fact that the wife of one of his fellowsaises fell in love with him and
then tried to poison him with arsenic because he would have nothing
to do with her he had to school himself into keeping quiet when Miss
Youghal went out riding with some man who tried to flirt with her and
he was forced to trot behind carrying the blanket and hearing every
word Also he had to keep his temper when he was slanged in Benmore
porch by a policemanespecially once when he was abused by a Naik he
had himself recruited from Isser Jang villageor worse still when a
young subaltern called him a pig for not making way quickly enough

But the life had its compensations He obtained great insight into the
ways and thefts of saisesenough he says to have summarily convicted
half the chamar population of the Punjab if he had been on business He
became one of the leading players at knucklebones which all jhampanis
and many saises play while they are waiting outside the Government House
or the Gaiety Theatre of nights he learned to smoke tobacco that was
threefourths cowdung and he heard the wisdom of the grizzled Jemadar
of the Government House saises whose words are valuable He saw many
things which amused him and he states on honor that no man can
appreciate Simla properly till he has seen it from the saiss point of
view

He also says that if he chose to write all he saw his head would be
broken in several places

Stricklands account of the agony he endured on wet nights hearing the
music and seeing the lights in Benmore with his toes tingling for a
waltz and his head in a horseblanket is rather amusing One of these
days Strickland is going to write a little book on his experiences
That book will be worth buying and even more worth suppressing

Thus he served faithfully as Jacob served for Rachel and his leave was
nearly at an end when the explosion came He had really done his best to
keep his temper in the hearing of the flirtations I have mentioned but
he broke down at last An old and very distinguished General took
Miss Youghal for a ride and began that specially offensive
youreonlyalittlegirl sort of flirtationmost difficult for
a woman to turn aside deftly and most maddening to listen to Miss
Youghal was shaking with fear at the things he said in the hearing of
her sais DullooStricklandstood it as long as he could Then he
caught hold of the Generals bridle and in most fluent English
invited him to step off and be heaved over the cliff Next minute Miss
Youghal began crying and Strickland saw that he had hopelessly given
himself away and everything was over

The General nearly had a fit while Miss Youghal was sobbing out the
story of the disguise and the engagement that wasnt recognized by the
parents Strickland was furiously angry with himself and more angry
with the General for forcing his hand so he said nothing but held
the horses head and prepared to thrash the General as some sort of
satisfaction but when the General had thoroughly grasped the story and
knew who Strickland was he began to puff and blow in the saddle and
nearly rolled off with laughing He said Strickland deserved a V C
if it were only for putting on a saiss blanket Then he called himself
names and vowed that he deserved a thrashing but he was too old to
take it from Strickland Then he complimented Miss Youghal on her lover

The scandal of the business never struck him for he was a nice old man
with a weakness for flirtations Then he laughed again and said
that old Youghal was a fool Strickland let go of the cobs head
and suggested that the General had better help them if that was his
opinion Strickland knew Youghals weakness for men with titles and
letters after their names and high official position

Its rather like a fortyminute farce said the General but begad I
WILL help if its only to escape that tremendous thrashing I deserved
Go along to your home my saisPoliceman and change into decent kit
and Ill attack Mr Youghal Miss Youghal may I ask you to canter home
and wait

About seven minutes later there was a wild hurroosh at the Club

A sais with a blanket and headrope was asking all the men he knew
For Heavens sake lend me decent clothes As the men did not recognize
him there were some peculiar scenes before Strickland could get a hot
bath with soda in it in one room a shirt here a collar there a pair
of trousers elsewhere and so on He galloped off with half the Club
wardrobe on his back and an utter strangers pony under him to the
house of old Youghal

The General arrayed in purple and fine linen was before him

What the General had said Strickland never knew but Youghal received
Strickland with moderate civility and Mrs Youghal touched by the
devotion of the transformed Dulloo was almost kind

The General beamed and chuckled and Miss Youghal came in and almost
before old Youghal knew where he was the parental consent had been
wrenched out and Strickland had departed with Miss Youghal to the
Telegraph Office to wire for his kit The final embarrassment was when
an utter stranger attacked him on the Mall and asked for the stolen
pony

So in the end Strickland and Miss Youghal were married on the strict
understanding that Strickland should drop his old ways and stick to
Departmental routine which pays best and leads to Simla

Strickland was far too fond of his wife just then to break his word
but it was a sore trial to him for the streets and the bazars and the
sounds in them were full of meaning to Strickland and these called to
him to come back and take up his wanderings and his discoveries Some
day I will tell you how he broke his promise to help a friend That
was long since and he has by this time been nearly spoilt for what
he would call shikar He is forgetting the slang and the beggars cant
and the marks and the signs and the drift of the undercurrents which
if a man would master he must always continue to learn

But he fills in his Departmental returns beautifully




YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER

 I am dying for you and you are dying for another Punjabi
 Proverb

When the Gravesend tender left the P  0 steamer for Bombay and went
back to catch the train to Town there were many people in it crying
But the one who wept most and most openly was Miss Agnes Laiter She
had reason to cry because the only man she ever lovedor ever could
love so she saidwas going out to India and India as every one
knows is divided equally between jungle tigers cobras cholera and
sepoys

Phil Garron leaning over the side of the steamer in the rain felt very
unhappy too but he did not cry He was sent out to tea What tea
meant he had not the vaguest idea but fancied that he would have to
ride on a prancing horse over hills covered with teavines and draw a
sumptuous salary for doing so and he was very grateful to his uncle
for getting him the berth He was really going to reform all his slack
shiftless ways save a large proportion of his magnificent salary
yearly and in a very short time return to marry Agnes Laiter Phil
Garron had been lying loose on his friends hands for three years and
as he had nothing to do he naturally fell in love He was very nice
but he was not strong in his views and opinions and principles and
though he never came to actual grief his friends were thankful when
he said goodbye and went out to this mysterious tea business near
Darjiling They saidGod bless you dear boy Let us never see your
face againor at least that was what Phil was given to understand

When he sailed he was very full of a great plan to prove himself
several hundred times better than any one had given him credit forto
work like a horse and triumphantly marry Agnes Laiter He had many good
points besides his good looks his only fault being that he was weak
the least little bit in the world weak He had as much notion of economy
as the Morning Sun and yet you could not lay your hand on any one item
and say Herein Phil Garron is extravagant or reckless Nor could
you point out any particular vice in his character but he was
unsatisfactory and as workable as putty

Agnes Laiter went about her duties at homeher family objected to the
engagementwith red eyes while Phil was sailing to Darjilinga port
on the Bengal Ocean as his mother used to tell her friends He was
popular enough on board ship made many acquaintances and a moderately
large liquor bill and sent off huge letters to Agnes Laiter at each
port Then he fell to work on this plantation somewhere between
Darjiling and Kangra and though the salary and the horse and the work
were not quite all he had fancied he succeeded fairly well and gave
himself much unnecessary credit for his perseverance

In the course of time as he settled more into collar and his work grew
fixed before him the face of Agnes Laiter went out of his mind and only
came when he was at leisure which was not often He would forget
all about her for a fortnight and remember her with a start like a
schoolboy who has forgotten to learn his lesson

She did not forget Phil because she was of the kind that never forgets
Only another mana really desirable young manpresented himself
before Mrs Laiter and the chance of a marriage with Phil was as far
off as ever and his letters were so unsatisfactory and there was a
certain amount of domestic pressure brought to bear on the girl and the
young man really was an eligible person as incomes go and the end of
all things was that Agnes married him and wrote a tempestuous whirlwind
of a letter to Phil in the wilds of Darjiling and said she should never
know a happy moment all the rest of her life Which was a true prophecy

Phil got that letter and held himself illtreated This was two years
after he had come out but by dint of thinking fixedly of Agnes Laiter
and looking at her photograph and patting himself on the back for being
one of the most constant lovers in history and warming to the work as
he went on he really fancied that he had been very hardly used He sat
down and wrote one final lettera really pathetic world without end
amen epistle explaining how he would be true to Eternity and that
all women were very much alike and he would hide his broken heart
etc etc but if at any future time etc etc he could afford to
wait etc etc unchanged affections etc etc return to her old
love etc etc for eight closelywritten pages From an artistic
point of view it was very neat work but an ordinary Philistine who
knew the state of Phils real feelingsnot the ones he rose to as he
went on writingwould have called it the thoroughly mean and selfish
work of a thoroughly mean and selfish weak man But this verdict would
have been incorrect Phil paid for the postage and felt every word he
had written for at least two days and a half

It was the last flicker before the light went out

That letter made Agnes Laiter very unhappy and she cried and put it
away in her desk and became Mrs Somebody Else for the good of her
family Which is the first duty of every Christian maid

Phil went his ways and thought no more of his letter except as an
artist thinks of a neatly touchedin sketch His ways were not bad but
they were not altogether good until they brought him across Dunmaya the
daughter of a Rajput exSubadarMajor of our Native Army The girl had a
strain of Hill blood in her and like the Hill women was not a purdah
nashin Where Phil met her or how he heard of her does not matter She
was a good girl and handsome and in her way very clever and shrewd
though of course a little hard It is to be remembered that Phil was
living very comfortably denying himself no small luxury never putting
by an anna very satisfied with himself and his good intentions was
dropping all his English correspondents one by one and beginning more
and more to look upon this land as his home Some men fall this way and
they are of no use afterwards The climate where he was stationed was
good and it really did not seem to him that there was anything to go
Home for

He did what many planters have done before himthat is to say he
made up his mind to marry a Hill girl and settle down He was seven and
twenty then with a long life before him but no spirit to go through
with it So he married Dunmaya by the forms of the English Church and
some fellowplanters said he was a fool and some said he was a
wise man Dunmaya was a thoroughly honest girl and in spite of her
reverence for an Englishman had a reasonable estimate of her husbands
weaknesses She managed him tenderly and became in less than a year a
very passable imitation of an English lady in dress and carriage It
is curious to think that a Hill man after a lifetimes education is
a Hill man still but a Hill woman can in six months master most of the
ways of her English sisters There was a coolie woman once But that is
another story Dunmaya dressed by preference in black and yellow and
looked well

Meantime the letter lay in Agness desk and now and again she would
think of poor resolute hardworking Phil among the cobras and tigers of
Darjiling toiling in the vain hope that she might come back to him Her
husband was worth ten Phils except that he had rheumatism of the
heart Three years after he was marriedand after he had tried Nice
and Algeria for his complainthe went to Bombay where he died and set
Agnes free Being a devout woman she looked on his death and the
place of it as a direct interposition of Providence and when she had
recovered from the shock she took out and reread Phils letter with the
etc etc and the big dashes and the little dashes and kissed it
several times No one knew her in Bombay she had her husbands income
which was a large one and Phil was close at hand It was wrong and
improper of course but she decided as heroines do in novels to find
her old lover to offer him her hand and her gold and with him spend
the rest of her life in some spot far from unsympathetic souls She sat
for two months alone in Watsons Hotel elaborating this decision and
the picture was a pretty one Then she set out in search of Phil Garron
Assistant on a tea plantation with a more than usually unpronounceable
name

She found him She spent a month over it for his plantation was not in
the Darjiling district at all but nearer Kangra Phil was very little
altered and Dunmaya was very nice to her

Now the particular sin and shame of the whole business is that Phil who
really is not worth thinking of twice was and is loved by Dunmaya
and more than loved by Agnes the whole of whose life he seems to have
spoilt

Worst of all Dunmaya is making a decent man of him and he will be
ultimately saved from perdition through her training

Which is manifestly unfair




FALSE DAWN

 Tonight God knows what thing shall tide
 The Earth is racked and faint
 Expectant sleepless openeyed
 And we who from the Earth were made
 Thrill with our Mothers pain
 In Durance

No man will ever know the exact truth of this story though women may
sometimes whisper it to one another after a dance when they are putting
up their hair for the night and comparing lists of victims A man of
course cannot assist at these functions So the tale must be told from
the outsidein the darkall wrong

Never praise a sister to a sister in the hope of your compliments
reaching the proper ears and so preparing the way for you later on
Sisters are women first and sisters afterwards and you will find that
you do yourself harm

Saumarez knew this when he made up his mind to propose to the elder Miss
Copleigh Saumarez was a strange man with few merits so far as men
could see though he was popular with women and carried enough
conceit to stock a Viceroys Council and leave a little over for the
CommanderinChiefs Staff He was a Civilian Very many women took an
interest in Saumarez perhaps because his manner to them was offensive
If you hit a pony over the nose at the outset of your acquaintance he
may not love you but he will take a deep interest in your movements
ever afterwards The elder Miss Copleigh was nice plump winning and
pretty The younger was not so pretty and from men disregarding the
hint set forth above her style was repellant and unattractive Both
girls had practically the same figure and there was a strong likeness
between them in look and voice though no one could doubt for an instant
which was the nicer of the two

Saumarez made up his mind as soon as they came into the station from
Behar to marry the elder one At least we all made sure that he
would which comes to the same thing She was two and twenty and he was
thirtythree with pay and allowances of nearly fourteen hundred rupees
a month So the match as we arranged it was in every way a good one
Saumarez was his name and summary was his nature as a man once said
Having drafted his Resolution he formed a Select Committee of One to
sit upon it and resolved to take his time In our unpleasant slang the
Copleigh girls hunted in couples That is to say you could do nothing
with one without the other They were very loving sisters but
their mutual affection was sometimes inconvenient Saumarez held the
balancehair true between them and none but himself could have said to
which side his heart inclined though every one guessed He rode
with them a good deal and danced with them but he never succeeded in
detaching them from each other for any length of time

Women said that the two girls kept together through deep mistrust each
fearing that the other would steal a march on her But that has nothing
to do with a man Saumarez was silent for good or bad and as
businesslikely attentive as he could be having due regard to his work
and his polo Beyond doubt both girls were fond of him

As the hot weather drew nearer and Saumarez made no sign women said
that you could see their trouble in the eyes of the girlsthat they
were looking strained anxious and irritable Men are quite blind in
these matters unless they have more of the woman than the man in their
composition in which case it does not matter what they say or think
I maintain it was the hot April days that took the color out of the
Copleigh girls cheeks They should have been sent to the Hills
early No oneman or womanfeels an angel when the hot weather is
approaching The younger sister grew more cynicalnot to say acidin
her ways and the winningness of the elder wore thin There was more
effort in it

Now the Station wherein all these things happened was though not
a little one off the line of rail and suffered through want of
attention There were no gardens or bands or amusements worth speaking
of and it was nearly a days journey to come into Lahore for a dance
People were grateful for small things to interest them

About the beginning of May and just before the final exodus of
Hillgoers when the weather was very hot and there were not more than
twenty people in the Station Saumarez gave a moonlight ridingpicnic at
an old tomb six miles away near the bed of the river It was a Noahs
Ark picnic and there was to be the usual arrangement of quartermile
intervals between each couple on account of the dust Six couples came
altogether including chaperons Moonlight picnics are useful just at
the very end of the season before all the girls go away to the Hills
They lead to understandings and should be encouraged by chaperones
especially those whose girls look sweetish in riding habits I knew a
case once But that is another story That picnic was called the Great
Pop Picnic because every one knew Saumarez would propose then to the
eldest Miss Copleigh and beside his affair there was another which
might possibly come to happiness

The social atmosphere was heavily charged and wanted clearing

We met at the paradeground at ten the night was fearfully hot

The horses sweated even at walkingpace but anything was better than
sitting still in our own dark houses When we moved off under the full
moon we were four couples one triplet and Mr Saumarez rode with the
Copleigh girls and I loitered at the tail of the procession wondering
with whom Saumarez would ride home Every one was happy and contented
but we all felt that things were going to happen We rode slowly and
it was nearly midnight before we reached the old tomb facing the ruined
tank in the decayed gardens where we were going to eat and drink I
was late in coming up and before I went into the garden I saw that the
horizon to the north carried a faint duncolored feather But no one
would have thanked me for spoiling so wellmanaged an entertainment as
this picnicand a duststorm more or less does no great harm

We gathered by the tank Some one had brought out a banjowhich is a
most sentimental instrumentand three or four of us sang

You must not laugh at this Our amusements in outoftheway Stations
are very few indeed Then we talked in groups or together lying under
the trees with the sunbaked roses dropping their petals on our feet
until supper was ready It was a beautiful supper as cold and as iced
as you could wish and we stayed long over it

I had felt that the air was growing hotter and hotter but nobody
seemed to notice it until the moon went out and a burning hot wind began
lashing the orangetrees with a sound like the noise of the sea Before
we knew where we were the duststorm was on us and everything was
roaring whirling darkness The suppertable was blown bodily into the
tank We were afraid of staying anywhere near the old tomb for fear it
might be blown down So we felt our way to the orangetrees where the
horses were picketed and waited for the storm to blow over Then the
little light that was left vanished and you could not see your hand
before your face The air was heavy with dust and sand from the bed
of the river that filled boots and pockets and drifted down necks and
coated eyebrows and moustaches It was one of the worst duststorms of
the year

We were all huddled together close to the trembling horses with the
thunder clattering overhead and the lightning spurting like water from
a sluice all ways at once There was no danger of course unless the
horses broke loose I was standing with my head downward and my hands
over my mouth hearing the trees thrashing each other I could not see
who was next me till the flashes came

Then I found that I was packed near Saumarez and the eldest Miss
Copleigh with my own horse just in front of me I recognized the eldest
Miss Copleigh because she had a pagri round her helmet and the younger
had not All the electricity in the air had gone into my body and I was
quivering and tingling from head to footexactly as a corn shoots and
tingles before rain It was a grand storm

The wind seemed to be picking up the earth and pitching it to leeward in
great heaps and the heat beat up from the ground like the heat of the
Day of Judgment

The storm lulled slightly after the first halfhour and I heard a
despairing little voice close to my ear saying to itself quietly and
softly as if some lost soul were flying about with the wind O my
God Then the younger Miss Copleigh stumbled into my arms saying
Where is my horse Get my horse I want to go home I WANT to go home
Take me home

I thought that the lightning and the black darkness had frightened her
so I said there was no danger but she must wait till the storm blew
over She answered It is not THAT It is not THAT I want to go home
O take me away from here

I said that she could not go till the light came but I felt her brush
past me and go away It was too dark to see where Then the whole sky
was split open with one tremendous flash as if the end of the world
were coming and all the women shrieked

Almost directly after this I felt a mans hand on my shoulder and heard
Saumarez bellowing in my ear Through the rattling of the trees and
howling of the wind I did not catch his words at once but at last
I heard him say Ive proposed to the wrong one What shall I do
Saumarez had no occasion to make this confidence to me I was never a
friend of his nor am I now but I fancy neither of us were ourselves
just then He was shaking as he stood with excitement and I was feeling
queer all over with the electricity

I could not think of anything to say exceptMore fool you for
proposing in a duststorm But I did not see how that would improve the
mistake

Then he shouted Wheres EdithEdith Copleigh Edith was the youngest
sister I answered out of my astonishmentWhat do you want with HER
Would you believe it for the next two minutes he and I were shouting
at each other like maniacshe vowing that it was the youngest sister he
had meant to propose to all along and I telling him till my throat
was hoarse that he must have made a mistake I cant account for
this except again by the fact that we were neither of us ourselves
Everything seemed to me like a bad dreamfrom the stamping of the
horses in the darkness to Saumarez telling me the story of his loving
Edith Copleigh since the first He was still clawing my shoulder and
begging me to tell him where Edith Copleigh was when another lull came
and brought light with it and we saw the dustcloud forming on the
plain in front of us So we knew the worst was over The moon was low
down and there was just the glimmer of the false dawn that comes about
an hour before the real one But the light was very faint and the dun
cloud roared like a bull I wondered where Edith Copleigh had gone and
as I was wondering I saw three things together First Maud Copleighs
face come smiling out of the darkness and move towards Saumarez who was
standing by me I heard the girl whisper George and slide her arm
through the arm that was not clawing my shoulder and I saw that look on
her face which only comes once or twice in a lifetimewhen a woman is
perfectly happy and the air is full of trumpets and gorgeouscolored
fire and the Earth turns into cloud because she loves and is loved At
the same time I saw Saumarezs face as he heard Maud Copleighs voice
and fifty yards away from the clump of orangetrees I saw a brown
holland habit getting upon a horse

It must have been my state of overexcitement that made me so quick
to meddle with what did not concern me Saumarez was moving off to the
habit but I pushed him back and saidStop here and explain Ill
fetch her back and I ran out to get at my own horse I had a perfectly
unnecessary notion that everything must be done decently and in order
and that Saumarezs first care was to wipe the happy look out of Maud
Copleighs face All the time I was linking up the curbchain I wondered
how he would do it

I cantered after Edith Copleigh thinking to bring her back slowly on
some pretence or another But she galloped away as soon as she saw me
and I was forced to ride after her in earnest She called back over her
shoulderGo away Im going home Oh go away two or three times
but my business was to catch her first and argue later The ride just
fitted in with the rest of the evil dream The ground was very bad and
now and again we rushed through the whirling choking dustdevils in
the skirts of the flying storm There was a burning hot wind blowing
that brought up a stench of stale brickkilns with it and through the
half light and through the dustdevils across that desolate plain
flickered the brown holland habit on the gray horse She headed for
the Station at first Then she wheeled round and set off for the river
through beds of burnt down junglegrass bad even to ride a pig over In
cold blood I should never have dreamed of going over such a country
at night but it seemed quite right and natural with the lightning
crackling overhead and a reek like the smell of the Pit in my nostrils
I rode and shouted and she bent forward and lashed her horse and the
aftermath of the duststorm came up and caught us both and drove us
downwind like pieces of paper

I dont know how far we rode but the drumming of the horsehoofs and
the roar of the wind and the race of the faint bloodred moon through
the yellow mist seemed to have gone on for years and years and I was
literally drenched with sweat from my helmet to my gaiters when the gray
stumbled recovered himself and pulled up dead lame My brute was used
up altogether Edith Copleigh was in a sad state plastered with dust
her helmet off and crying bitterly Why cant you let me alone she
said I only wanted to get away and go home Oh PLEASE let me go

You have got to come back with me Miss Copleigh Saumarez has
something to say to you

It was a foolish way of putting it but I hardly knew Miss Copleigh
and though I was playing Providence at the cost of my horse I could
not tell her in as many words what Saumarez had told me I thought he
could do that better himself All her pretence about being tired and
wanting to go home broke down and she rocked herself to and fro in the
saddle as she sobbed and the hot wind blew her black hair to leeward I
am not going to repeat what she said because she was utterly unstrung

This if you please was the cynical Miss Copleigh Here was I almost
an utter stranger to her trying to tell her that Saumarez loved her
and she was to come back to hear him say so I believe I made myself
understood for she gathered the gray together and made him hobble
somehow and we set off for the tomb while the storm went thundering
down to Umballa and a few big drops of warm rain fell I found out that
she had been standing close to Saumarez when he proposed to her sister
and had wanted to go home and cry in peace as an English girl should
She dabbled her eyes with her pockethandkerchief as we went along and
babbled to me out of sheer lightness of heart and hysteria That was
perfectly unnatural and yet it seemed all right at the time and in the
place All the world was only the two Copleigh girls Saumarez and I
ringed in with the lightning and the dark and the guidance of this
misguided world seemed to lie in my hands

When we returned to the tomb in the deep dead stillness that followed
the storm the dawn was just breaking and nobody had gone away They
were waiting for our return Saumarez most of all

His face was white and drawn As Miss Copleigh and I limped up he came
forward to meet us and when he helped her down from her saddle he
kissed her before all the picnic It was like a scene in a theatre and
the likeness was heightened by all the dustwhite ghostlylooking men
and women under the orangetrees clapping their hands as if they
were watching a playat Saumarezs choice I never knew anything so
unEnglish in my life

Lastly Saumarez said we must all go home or the Station would come
out to look for us and WOULD I be good enough to ride home with Maud
Copleigh Nothing would give me greater pleasure I said

So we formed up six couples in all and went back two by two Saumarez
walking at the side of Edith Copleigh who was riding his horse

The air was cleared and little by little as the sun rose I felt we
were all dropping back again into ordinary men and women and that
the Great Pop Picnic was a thing altogether apart and out of the
worldnever to happen again It had gone with the duststorm and the
tingle in the hot air

I felt tired and limp and a good deal ashamed of myself as I went in
for a bath and some sleep

There is a womans version of this story but it will never be written
 unless Maud Copleigh cares to try




THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES

 Thus for a season they fought it fair
 She and his cousin May
 Tactful talented debonnaire
 Decorous foes were they
 But never can battle of man compare
 With merciless feminine fray
 Two and One

Mrs Hauksbee was sometimes nice to her own sex Here is a story to
prove this and you can believe just as much as ever you please

Pluffles was a subaltern in the Unmentionables He was callow even
for a subaltern He was callow all overlike a canary that had not
finished fledging itself The worst of it was he had three times as much
money as was good for him Pluffles Papa being a rich man and Pluffles
being the only son Pluffles Mamma adored him She was only a little
less callow than Pluffles and she believed everything he said

Pluffles weakness was not believing what people said He preferred what
he called trusting to his own judgment He had as much judgment as he
had seat or hands and this preference tumbled him into trouble once or
twice But the biggest trouble Pluffles ever manufactured came about at
Simlasome years ago when he was fourandtwenty

He began by trusting to his own judgment as usual and the result
was that after a time he was bound hand and foot to Mrs Reivers
rickshaw wheels

There was nothing good about Mrs Reiver unless it was her dress

She was bad from her hairwhich started life on a Brittanys girls
headto her bootheels which were two and threeeighth inches high
She was not honestly mischievous like Mrs Hauksbee she was wicked in a
businesslike way

There was never any scandalshe had not generous impulses enough for
that She was the exception which proved the rule that AngloIndian
ladies are in every way as nice as their sisters at Home

She spent her life in proving that rule

Mrs Hauksbee and she hated each other fervently They heard far
too much to clash but the things they said of each other were
startlingnot to say original Mrs Hauksbee was honesthonest as her
own front teethand but for her love of mischief would have been
a womans woman There was no honesty about Mrs Reiver nothing but
selfishness And at the beginning of the season poor little Pluffles
fell a prey to her She laid herself out to that end and who was
Pluffles to resist He went on trusting to his judgment and he got
judged

I have seen Hayes argue with a tough horseI have seen a tongadriver
coerce a stubborn ponyI have seen a riotous setter broken to gun by a
hard keeperbut the breakingin of Pluffles of the Unmentionables was
beyond all these He learned to fetch and carry like a dog and to
wait like one too for a word from Mrs Reiver He learned to keep
appointments which Mrs Reiver had no intention of keeping He learned
to take thankfully dances which Mrs Reiver had no intention of giving
him He learned to shiver for an hour and a quarter on the windward side
of Elysium while Mrs Reiver was making up her mind to come for a
ride He learned to hunt for a rickshaw in a light dresssuit under
a pelting rain and to walk by the side of that rickshaw when he had
found it He learned what it was to be spoken to like a coolie and
ordered about like a cook He learned all this and many other things
besides And he paid for his schooling

Perhaps in some hazy way he fancied that it was fine and impressive
that it gave him a status among men and was altogether the thing to do
It was nobodys business to warn Pluffles that he was unwise The pace
that season was too good to inquire and meddling with another mans
folly is always thankless work

Pluffles Colonel should have ordered him back to his regiment when he
heard how things were going But Pluffles had got himself engaged to a
girl in England the last time he went home and if there was one
thing more than another which the Colonel detested it was a married
subaltern He chuckled when he heard of the education of Pluffles and
said it was good training for the boy But it was not good training in
the least It led him into spending money beyond his means which were
good above that the education spoilt an average boy and made it a
tenthrate man of an objectionable kind He wandered into a bad set and
his little bill at Hamiltons was a thing to wonder at

Then Mrs Hauksbee rose to the occasion She played her game alone
knowing what people would say of her and she played it for the sake of
a girl she had never seen Pluffles fiancee was to come out under the
chaperonage of an aunt in October to be married to Pluffles

At the beginning of August Mrs Hauksbee discovered that it was time to
interfere A man who rides much knows exactly what a horse is going to
do next before he does it In the same way a woman of Mrs Hauksbees
experience knows accurately how a boy will behave under certain
circumstancesnotably when he is infatuated with one of Mrs Reivers
stamp She said that sooner or later little Pluffles would break off
that engagement for nothing at allsimply to gratify Mrs Reiver who
in return would keep him at her feet and in her service just so long as
she found it worth her while

She said she knew the signs of these things If she did not no one else
could

Then she went forth to capture Pluffles under the guns of the enemy
just as Mrs CusackBremmil carried away Bremmil under Mrs Hauksbees
eyes

This particular engagement lasted seven weekswe called it the Seven
Weeks Warand was fought out inch by inch on both sides A detailed
account would fill a book and would be incomplete then

Any one who knows about these things can fit in the details for himself
It was a superb fightthere will never be another like it as long as
Jakko standsand Pluffles was the prize of victory

People said shameful things about Mrs Hauksbee They did not know what
she was playing for Mrs Reiver fought partly because Pluffles was
useful to her but mainly because she hated Mrs Hauksbee and the
matter was a trial of strength between them No one knows what Pluffles
thought He had not many ideas at the best of times and the few he
possessed made him conceited Mrs Hauksbee saidThe boy must be
caught and the only way of catching him is by treating him well

So she treated him as a man of the world and of experience so long as
the issue was doubtful Little by little Pluffles fell away from his
old allegiance and came over to the enemy by whom he was made much of
He was never sent on outpost duty after rickshaws any more nor was
he given dances which never came off nor were the drains on his
purse continued Mrs Hauksbee held him on the snaffle and after his
treatment at Mrs Reivers hands he appreciated the change

Mrs Reiver had broken him of talking about himself and made him
talk about her own merits Mrs Hauksbee acted otherwise and won
his confidence till he mentioned his engagement to the girl at Home
speaking of it in a high and mighty way as a piece of boyish folly
This was when he was taking tea with her one afternoon and discoursing
in what he considered a gay and fascinating style

Mrs Hauksbee had seen an earlier generation of his stamp bud and
blossom and decay into fat Captains and tubby Majors

At a moderate estimate there were about three and twenty sides to that
ladys character Some men say more She began to talk to Pluffles after
the manner of a mother and as if there had been three hundred years
instead of fifteen between them She spoke with a sort of throaty
quaver in her voice which had a soothing effect though what she said
was anything but soothing She pointed out the exceeding folly not to
say meanness of Pluffles conduct and the smallness of his views Then
he stammered something about trusting to his own judgment as a man of
the world and this paved the way for what she wanted to say next It
would have withered up Pluffles had it come from any other woman but
in the soft cooing style in which Mrs Hauksbee put it it only made
him feel limp and repentantas if he had been in some superior kind of
church Little by little very softly and pleasantly she began taking
the conceit out of Pluffles as you take the ribs out of an umbrella
before recovering it She told him what she thought of him and his
judgment and his knowledge of the world and how his performances had
made him ridiculous to other people and how it was his intention to
make love to herself if she gave him the chance Then she said
that marriage would be the making of him and drew a pretty little
pictureall rose and opalof the Mrs Pluffles of the future going
through life relying on the judgment and knowledge of the world of
a husband who had nothing to reproach himself with How she reconciled
these two statements she alone knew But they did not strike Pluffles as
conflicting

Hers was a perfect little homilymuch better than any clergyman could
have givenand it ended with touching allusions to Pluffles Mamma and
Papa and the wisdom of taking his bride Home

Then she sent Pluffles out for a walk to think over what she had said
Pluffles left blowing his nose very hard and holding himself very
straight Mrs Hauksbee laughed

What Pluffles had intended to do in the matter of the engagement only
Mrs Reiver knew and she kept her own counsel to her death She would
have liked it spoiled as a compliment I fancy

Pluffles enjoyed many talks with Mrs Hauksbee during the next few days
They were all to the same end and they helped Pluffles in the path of
Virtue

Mrs Hauksbee wanted to keep him under her wing to the last

Therefore she discountenanced his going down to Bombay to get married
Goodness only knows what might happen by the way she said Pluffles
is cursed with the curse of Reuben and India is no fit place for him

In the end the fiancee arrived with her aunt and Pluffles having
reduced his affairs to some sort of orderhere again Mrs Hauksbee
helped himwas married

Mrs Hauksbee gave a sigh of relief when both the I wills had been
said and went her way

Pluffles took her advice about going Home He left the Service and is
now raising speckled cattle inside green painted fences somewhere at
Home I believe he does this very judiciously He would have come to
extreme grief out here

For these reasons if any one says anything more than usually nasty about
Mrs Hauksbee tell him the story of the Rescue of Pluffles




CUPIDS ARROWS

 Pit where the buffalo cooled his hide
 By the hot sun emptied and blistered and dried
 Log in the rehgrass hidden and alone
 Bund where the earthrats mounds are strown
 Cave in the bank where the sly stream steals
 Aloe that stabs at the belly and heels
 Jump if you dare on a steed untriedSafer it is to go wide
 go wide
 Hark from in front where the best men ride
 Pull to the off boys Wide Go wide
 The Peora Hunt

Once upon a time there lived at Simla a very pretty girl the daughter
of a poor but honest District and Sessions Judge She was a good girl
but could not help knowing her power and using it

Her Mamma was very anxious about her daughters future as all good
Mammas should be

When a man is a Commissioner and a bachelor and has the right of wearing
openwork jamtart jewels in gold and enamel on his clothes and of
going through a door before every one except a Member of Council a
LieutenantGovernor or a Viceroy he is worth marrying At least that
is what ladies say There was a Commissioner in Simla in those days
who was and wore and did all I have said He was a plain manan ugly
manthe ugliest man in Asia with two exceptions His was a face to
dream about and try to carve on a pipehead afterwards His name was
SaggottBarrSaggottAnthony BarrSaggott and six letters to follow

Departmentally he was one of the best men the Government of India
owned Socially he was like a blandishing gorilla

When he turned his attentions to Miss Beighton I believe that Mrs

Beighton wept with delight at the reward Providence had sent her in her
old age

Mr Beighton held his tongue He was an easygoing man

Now a Commissioner is very rich His pay is beyond the dreams of
avariceis so enormous that he can afford to save and scrape in a way
that would almost discredit a Member of Council Most Commissioners
are mean but BarrSaggott was an exception He entertained royally he
horsed himself well he gave dances he was a power in the land and he
behaved as such

Consider that everything I am writing of took place in an almost
prehistoric era in the history of British India Some folk may remember
the years before lawntennis was born when we all played croquet There
were seasons before that if you will believe me when even croquet
had not been invented and archerywhich was revived in England in
1844was as great a pest as lawntennis is now People talked learnedly
about holding and loosing steles reflexed bows 56pound
bows backed or selfyew bows as we talk about rallies
volleys smashes returns and 16ounce rackets

Miss Beighton shot divinely over ladies distance60 yards that
isand was acknowledged the best lady archer in Simla Men called her
Diana of TaraDevi

BarrSaggott paid her great attention and as I have said the heart of
her mother was uplifted in consequence Kitty Beighton took matters more
calmly It was pleasant to be singled out by a Commissioner with letters
after his name and to fill the hearts of other girls with bad feelings
But there was no denying the fact that BarrSaggott was phenomenally
ugly and all his attempts to adorn himself only made him more
grotesque He was not christened The Langurwhich means gray apefor
nothing It was pleasant Kitty thought to have him at her feet but
it was better to escape from him and ride with the graceless Cubbonthe
man in a Dragoon Regiment at Umballathe boy with a handsome face and
no prospects Kitty liked Cubbon more than a little He never pretended
for a moment the he was anything less than head over heels in love with
her for he was an honest boy So Kitty fled now and again from the
stately wooings of BarrSaggott to the company of young Cubbon and
was scolded by her Mamma in consequence But Mother she said Mr
Saggott is suchsuch ais so FEARFULLY ugly you know

My dear said Mrs Beighton piously we cannot be other than an
allruling Providence has made us Besides you will take precedence of
your own Mother you know Think of that and be reasonable

Then Kitty put up her little chin and said irreverent things about
precedence and Commissioners and matrimony Mr Beighton rubbed the
top of his head for he was an easygoing man

Late in the season when he judged that the time was ripe BarrSaggott
developed a plan which did great credit to his administrative powers
He arranged an archery tournament for ladies with a most sumptuous
diamondstudded bracelet as prize

He drew up his terms skilfully and every one saw that the bracelet was
a gift to Miss Beighton the acceptance carrying with it the hand and
the heart of Commissioner BarrSaggott The terms were a St Leonards
Roundthirtysix shots at sixty yardsunder the rules of the Simla
Toxophilite Society

All Simla was invited There were beautifully arranged teatables under
the deodars at Annandale where the Grand Stand is now and alone in
its glory winking in the sun sat the diamond bracelet in a blue velvet
case Miss Beighton was anxiousalmost too anxious to compete On the
appointed afternoon all Simla rode down to Annandale to witness the
Judgment of Paris turned upside down

Kitty rode with young Cubbon and it was easy to see that the boy
was troubled in his mind He must be held innocent of everything that
followed Kitty was pale and nervous and looked long at the bracelet
BarrSaggott was gorgeously dressed even more nervous than Kitty and
more hideous than ever

Mrs Beighton smiled condescendingly as befitted the mother of a
potential Commissioneress and the shooting began all the world
standing in a semicircle as the ladies came out one after the other

Nothing is so tedious as an archery competition They shot and they
shot and they kept on shooting till the sun left the valley and
little breezes got up in the deodars and people waited for Miss
Beighton to shoot and win Cubbon was at one horn of the semicircle
round the shooters and BarrSaggott at the other Miss Beighton was
last on the list The scoring had been weak and the bracelet PLUS
Commissioner BarrSaggott was hers to a certainty

The Commissioner strung her bow with his own sacred hands She stepped
forward looked at the bracelet and her first arrow went true to a
hairfull into the heart of the goldcounting nine points

Young Cubbon on the left turned white and his Devil prompted
BarrSaggott to smile Now horses used to shy when BarrSaggott smiled

Kitty saw that smile She looked to her leftfront gave an almost
imperceptible nod to Cubbon and went on shooting

I wish I could describe the scene that followed It was out of the
ordinary and most improper Miss Kitty fitted her arrows with immense
deliberation so that every one might see what she was doing She was
a perfect shot and her 46pound bow suited her to a nicety She pinned
the wooden legs of the target with great care four successive times She
pinned the wooden top of the target once and all the ladies looked at
each other Then she began some fancy shooting at the white which
if you hit it counts exactly one point She put five arrows into the
white It was wonderful archery but seeing that her business was to
make golds and win the bracelet BarrSaggott turned a delicate green
like young watergrass Next she shot over the target twice then wide
to the left twicealways with the same deliberationwhile a chilly
hush fell over the company and Mrs Beighton took out her handkerchief
Then Kitty shot at the ground in front of the target and split several
arrows Then she made a redor seven pointsjust to show what she
could do if she liked and finished up her amazing performance with some
more fancy shooting at the targetsupports Here is her score as it was
picked off

 Gold Red Blue Black White Total Hits Total Score Miss Beighton
 1 1 0 0 5 7 21

BarrSaggott looked as if the last few arrowheads had been driven into
his legs instead of the targets and the deep stillness was broken by
a little snubby mottled halfgrown girl saying in a shrill voice of
triumph Then IVE won

Mrs Beighton did her best to bear up but she wept in the presence of
the people No training could help her through such a disappointment
Kitty unstrung her bow with a vicious jerk and went back to her place
while BarrSaggott was trying to pretend that he enjoyed snapping
the bracelet on the snubby girls raw red wrist It was an awkward
scenemost awkward Every one tried to depart in a body and leave Kitty
to the mercy of her Mamma

But Cubbon took her away instead andthe rest isnt worth printing




HIS CHANCE IN LIFE

 Then a pile of heads be laid
 Thirty thousand heaped on high
 All to please the Kafir maid
 Where the Oxus ripples by

 Grimly spake Atulla Khan
 Love hath made this thing a Man
 Oattas Story

If you go straight away from Levees and Government House Lists past
Trades Ballsfar beyond everything and everybody you ever knew in your
respectable lifeyou cross in time the Border line where the last
drop of White blood ends and the full tide of Black sets in It would be
easier to talk to a newmade Duchess on the spur of the moment than
to the Borderline folk without violating some of their conventions or
hurting their feelings The Black and the White mix very quaintly in
their ways Sometimes the White shows in spurts of fierce childish
pridewhich is Pride of Race run crookedand sometimes the Black
in still fiercer abasement and humility half heathenish customs and
strange unaccountable impulses to crime One of these days this
peopleunderstand they are far lower than the class whence Derozio the
man who imitated Byron sprungwill turn out a writer or a poet and
then we shall know how they live and what they feel In the meantime
any stories about them cannot be absolutely correct in fact or
inference

Miss Vezzis came from across the Borderline to look after some children
who belonged to a lady until a regularly ordained nurse could come out
The lady said Miss Vezzis was a bad dirty nurse and inattentive It
never struck her that Miss Vezzis had her own life to lead and her own
affairs to worry over and that these affairs were the most important
things in the world to Miss Vezzis

Very few mistresses admit this sort of reasoning Miss Vezzis was as
black as a boot and to our standard of taste hideously ugly

She wore cottonprint gowns and bulged shoes and when she lost her
temper with the children she abused them in the language of the
Borderlinewhich is part English part Portuguese and part Native
She was not attractive but she had her pride and she preferred being
called Miss Vezzis

Every Sunday she dressed herself wonderfully and went to see her
Mamma who lived for the most part on an old cane chair in a greasy
tussursilk dressinggown and a big rabbitwarren of a house full of
Vezzises Pereiras Ribieras Lisboas and Gansalveses and a floating
population of loafers besides fragments of the days bazar garlic
stale incense clothes thrown on the floor petticoats hung on strings
for screens old bottles pewter crucifixes dried immortelles pariah
puppies plaster images of the Virgin and hats without crowns Miss
Vezzis drew twenty rupees a month for acting as nurse and she
squabbled weekly with her Mamma as to the percentage to be given towards
housekeeping

When the quarrel was over Michele DCruze used to shamble across the
low mud wall of the compound and make love to Miss Vezzis after the
fashion of the Borderline which is hedged about with much ceremony
Michele was a poor sickly weed and very black but he had his pride
He would not be seen smoking a huqa for anything and he looked down on
natives as only a man with seveneighths native blood in his veins can
The Vezzis Family had their pride too They traced their descent from
a mythical platelayer who had worked on the Sone Bridge when railways
were new in India and they valued their English origin Michele was
a Telegraph Signaller on Rs 35 a month The fact that he was in
Government employ made Mrs Vezzis lenient to the shortcomings of his
ancestors

There was a compromising legendDom Anna the tailor brought it from
Poonanithat a black Jew of Cochin had once married into the DCruze
family while it was an open secret that an uncle of Mrs DCruze was at
that very time doing menial work connected with cooking for a Club in
Southern India He sent Mrs DCruze seven rupees eight annas a month
but she felt the disgrace to the family very keenly all the same

However in the course of a few Sundays Mrs Vezzis brought herself
to overlook these blemishes and gave her consent to the marriage of her
daughter with Michele on condition that Michele should have at least
fifty rupees a month to start married life upon This wonderful prudence
must have been a lingering touch of the mythical platelayers Yorkshire
blood for across the Borderline people take a pride in marrying when
they pleasenot when they can

Having regard to his departmental prospects Miss Vezzis might as well
have asked Michele to go away and come back with the Moon in his pocket
But Michele was deeply in love with Miss Vezzis and that helped him to
endure He accompanied Miss Vezzis to Mass one Sunday and after Mass
walking home through the hot stale dust with her hand in his he swore
by several Saints whose names would not interest you never to forget
Miss Vezzis and she swore by her Honor and the Saintsthe oath runs
rather curiously In nomine Sanctissimae whatever the name of the
sheSaint is and so forth ending with a kiss on the forehead a kiss
on the left cheek and a kiss on the mouthnever to forget Michele

Next week Michele was transferred and Miss Vezzis dropped tears
upon the windowsash of the Intermediate compartment as he left the
Station

If you look at the telegraphmap of India you will see a long line
skirting the coast from Backergunge to Madras Michele was ordered to
Tibasu a little Suboffice onethird down this line to send messages
on from Berhampur to Chicacola and to think of Miss Vezzis and his
chances of getting fifty rupees a month out of office hours He had the
noise of the Bay of Bengal and a Bengali Babu for company nothing more
He sent foolish letters with crosses tucked inside the flaps of the
envelopes to Miss Vezzis

When he had been at Tibasu for nearly three weeks his chance came

Never forget that unless the outward and visible signs of Our
Authority are always before a native he is as incapable as a child of
understanding what authority means or where is the danger of disobeying
it Tibasu was a forgotten little place with a few Orissa Mohamedans
in it These hearing nothing of the CollectorSahib for some time
and heartily despising the Hindu SubJudge arranged to start a little
Mohurrum riot of their own But the Hindus turned out and broke their
heads when finding lawlessness pleasant Hindus and Mahomedans
together raised an aimless sort of Donnybrook just to see how far they
could go They looted each others shops and paid off private grudges
in the regular way It was a nasty little riot but not worth putting in
the newspapers

Michele was working in his office when he heard the sound that a man
never forgets all his lifethe ahyah of an angry crowd

When that sound drops about three tones and changes to a thick
droning ut the man who hears it had better go away if he is alone The
Native Police Inspector ran in and told Michele that the town was in an
uproar and coming to wreck the Telegraph Office

The Babu put on his cap and quietly dropped out of the window while
the Police Inspector afraid but obeying the old raceinstinct
which recognizes a drop of White blood as far as it can be diluted
saidWhat orders does the Sahib give

The Sahib decided Michele Though horribly frightened he felt that
for the hour he the man with the Cochin Jew and the menial uncle in
his pedigree was the only representative of English authority in the
place Then he thought of Miss Vezzis and the fifty rupees and took the
situation on himself There were seven native policemen in Tibasu and
four crazy smoothbore muskets among them All the men were gray with
fear but not beyond leading Michele dropped the key of the telegraph
instrument and went out at the head of his army to meet the mob As
the shouting crew came round a corner of the road he dropped and fired
the men behind him loosing instinctively at the same time

The whole crowdcurs to the backboneyelled and ran leaving one man
dead and another dying in the road Michele was sweating with fear but
he kept his weakness under and went down into the town past the house
where the SubJudge had barricaded himself The streets were empty
Tibasu was more frightened than Michele for the mob had been taken at
the right time

Michele returned to the TelegraphOffice and sent a message to
Chicacola asking for help Before an answer came he received a
deputation of the elders of Tibasu telling him that the SubJudge said
his actions generally were unconstitional and trying to bully him
But the heart of Michele DCruze was big and white in his breast
because of his love for Miss Vezzis the nursegirl and because he had
tasted for the first time Responsibility and Success Those two make
an intoxicating drink and have ruined more men than ever has Whiskey
Michele answered that the SubJudge might say what he pleased but
until the Assistant Collector came the Telegraph Signaller was the
Government of India in Tibasu and the elders of the town would be held
accountable for further rioting Then they bowed their heads and said
Show mercy or words to that effect and went back in great fear each
accusing the other of having begun the rioting

Early in the dawn after a nights patrol with his seven policemen
Michele went down the road musket in hand to meet the Assistant
Collector who had ridden in to quell Tibasu But in the presence of
this young Englishman Michele felt himself slipping back more and more
into the native and the tale of the Tibasu Riots ended with the strain
on the teller in an hysterical outburst of tears bred by sorrow that
he had killed a man shame that he could not feel as uplifted as he had
felt through the night and childish anger that his tongue could not
do justice to his great deeds It was the White drop in Micheles veins
dying out though he did not know it

But the Englishman understood and after he had schooled those men
of Tibasu and had conferred with the SubJudge till that excellent
official turned green he found time to draught an official letter
describing the conduct of Michele Which letter filtered through the
Proper Channels and ended in the transfer of Michele upcountry once
more on the Imperial salary of sixtysix rupees a month

So he and Miss Vezzis were married with great state and ancientry and
now there are several little DCruzes sprawling about the verandahs of
the Central Telegraph Office

But if the whole revenue of the Department he serves were to be his
reward Michele could never never repeat what he did at Tibasu for the
sake of Miss Vezzis the nursegirl

Which proves that when a man does good work out of all proportion to
his pay in seven cases out of nine there is a woman at the back of the
virtue

The two exceptions must have suffered from sunstroke




WATCHES OF THE NIGHT

 What is in the Brahmins books that is in the Brahmins heart
 Neither you nor I knew there was so much evil in the world
 Hindu Proverb

This began in a practical joke but it has gone far enough now and is
getting serious

Platte the Subaltern being poor had a Waterbury watch and a plain
leather guard

The Colonel had a Waterbury watch also and for guard the lipstrap of
a curbchain Lipstraps make the best watch guards

They are strong and short Between a lipstrap and an ordinary leather
guard there is no great difference between one Waterbury watch
and another there is none at all Every one in the station knew the
Colonels lipstrap He was not a horsey man but he liked people to
believe he had been one once and he wove fantastic stories of the
huntingbridle to which this particular lipstrap had belonged
Otherwise he was painfully religious

Platte and the Colonel were dressing at the Clubboth late for their
engagements and both in a hurry That was Kismet The two watches
were on a shelf below the lookingglassguards hanging down That was
carelessness Platte changed first snatched a watch looked in the
glass settled his tie and ran Forty seconds later the Colonel did
exactly the same thing each man taking the others watch

You may have noticed that many religious people are deeply suspicious
They seemfor purely religious purposes of courseto know more about
iniquity than the Unregenerate Perhaps they were specially bad before
they became converted At any rate in the imputation of things evil
and in putting the worst construction on things innocent a certain type
of good people may be trusted to surpass all others The Colonel and
his Wife were of that type But the Colonels Wife was the worst She
manufactured the Station scandal andTALKED TO HER AYAH Nothing
more need be said The Colonels Wife broke up the Laplacess home The
Colonels Wife stopped the FerrisHaughtrey engagement The Colonels
Wife induced young Buxton to keep his wife down in the Plains through
the first year of the marriage Whereby little Mrs

Buxton died and the baby with her These things will be remembered
against the Colonels Wife so long as there is a regiment in the
country

But to come back to the Colonel and Platte They went their several
ways from the dressingroom The Colonel dined with two Chaplains while
Platte went to a bachelorparty and whist to follow

Mark how things happen If Plattes sais had put the new saddlepad on
the mare the butts of the terrets would not have worked through the
worn leather and the old pad into the mares withers when she was
coming home at two oclock in the morning She would not have reared
bolted fallen into a ditch upset the cart and sent Platte flying over
an aloehedge on to Mrs Larkyns wellkept lawn and this tale would
never have been written But the mare did all these things and while
Platte was rolling over and over on the turf like a shot rabbit the
watch and guard flew from his waistcoatas an Infantry Majors sword
hops out of the scabbard when they are firing a feu de joieand rolled
and rolled in the moonlight till it stopped under a window

Platte stuffed his handkerchief under the pad put the cart straight
and went home

Mark again how Kismet works This would not happen once in a hundred
years Towards the end of his dinner with the two Chaplains the Colonel
let out his waistcoat and leaned over the table to look at some Mission
Reports The bar of the watchguard worked through the buttonhole and
the watchPlattes watchslid quietly on to the carpet Where the
bearer found it next morning and kept it

Then the Colonel went home to the wife of his bosom but the driver of
the carriage was drunk and lost his way So the Colonel returned at an
unseemly hour and his excuses were not accepted If the Colonels Wife
had been an ordinary vessel of wrath appointed for destruction she
would have known that when a man stays away on purpose his excuse
is always sound and original The very baldness of the Colonels
explanation proved its truth

See once more the workings of Kismet The Colonels watch which came
with Platte hurriedly on to Mrs Larkyns lawn chose to stop just under
Mrs Larkyns window where she saw it early in the morning recognized
it and picked it up She had heard the crash of Plattes cart at two
oclock that morning and his voice calling the mare names She knew
Platte and liked him That day she showed him the watch and heard his
story He put his head on one side winked and saidHow disgusting
Shocking old man with his religious training too I should send the
watch to the Colonels Wife and ask for explanations

Mrs Larkyn thought for a minute of the Laplaceswhom she had known
when Laplace and his wife believed in each otherand answeredI will
send it I think it will do her good But remember we must NEVER tell
her the truth

Platte guessed that his own watch was in the Colonels possession and
thought that the return of the lipstrapped Waterbury with a soothing
note from Mrs Larkyn would merely create a small trouble for a few
minutes Mrs Larkyn knew better She knew that any poison dropped would
find good holdingground in the heart of the Colonels Wife

The packet and a note containing a few remarks on the Colonels
callinghours were sent over to the Colonels Wife who wept in her own
room and took counsel with herself

If there was one woman under Heaven whom the Colonels Wife hated with
holy fervor it was Mrs Larkyn Mrs Larkyn was a frivolous lady
and called the Colonels Wife old cat The Colonels Wife said that
somebody in Revelations was remarkably like Mrs Larkyn

She mentioned other Scripture people as well From the Old Testament
But the Colonels Wife was the only person who cared or dared to say
anything against Mrs Larkyn Every one else accepted her as an amusing
honest little body Wherefore to believe that her husband had been
shedding watches under that Things window at ungodly hours coupled
with the fact of his late arrival on the previous night was

At this point she rose up and sought her husband He denied everything
except the ownership of the watch She besought him for his Souls
sake to speak the truth He denied afresh with two bad words Then a
stony silence held the Colonels Wife while a man could draw his breath
five times

The speech that followed is no affair of mine or yours It was made up
of wifely and womanly jealousy knowledge of old age and sunken cheeks
deep mistrust born of the text that says even little babies hearts
are as bad as they make them rancorous hatred of Mrs Larkyn and the
tenets of the creed of the Colonels Wifes upbringing

Over and above all was the damning lipstrapped Waterbury ticking away
in the palm of her shaking withered hand At that hour I think the
Colonels Wife realized a little of the restless suspicions she had
injected into old Laplaces mind a little of poor Miss Haughtreys
misery and some of the canker that ate into Buxtons heart as he
watched his wife dying before his eyes The Colonel stammered and tried
to explain Then he remembered that his watch had disappeared and the
mystery grew greater The Colonels Wife talked and prayed by turns
till she was tired and went away to devise means for chastening the
stubborn heart of her husband Which translated means in our slang
tailtwisting

You see being deeply impressed with the doctrine of Original Sin she
could not believe in the face of appearances She knew too much and
jumped to the wildest conclusions

But it was good for her It spoilt her life as she had spoilt the life
of the Laplaces She had lost her faith in the Colonel andhere the
creed suspicion came inhe might she argued have erred many times
before a merciful Providence at the hands of so unworthy an instrument
as Mrs Larkyn had established his guilt

He was a bad wicked grayhaired profligate This may sound too sudden
a revulsion for a longwedded wife but it is a venerable fact that if
a man or woman makes a practice of and takes a delight in believing
and spreading evil of people indifferent to him or her he or she will
end in believing evil of folk very near and dear You may think also
that the mere incident of the watch was too small and trivial to raise
this misunderstanding It is another aged fact that in life as well as
racing all the worst accidents happen at little ditches and cutdown
fences In the same way you sometimes see a woman who would have made a
Joan of Arc in another century and climate threshing herself to pieces
over all the mean worry of housekeeping But that is another story

Her belief only made the Colonels Wife more wretched because it
insisted so strongly on the villainy of men Remembering what she had
done it was pleasant to watch her unhappiness and the pennyfarthing
attempts she made to hide it from the Station But the Station knew and
laughed heartlessly for they had heard the story of the watch with
much dramatic gesture from Mrs Larkyns lips

Once or twice Platte said to Mrs Larkyn seeing that the Colonel had
not cleared himselfThis thing has gone far enough I move we tell
the Colonels Wife how it happened Mrs Larkyn shut her lips and shook
her head and vowed that the Colonels Wife must bear her punishment
as best she could Now Mrs Larkyn was a frivolous woman in whom none
would have suspected deep hate So Platte took no action and came to
believe gradually from the Colonels silence that the Colonel must
have run off the line somewhere that night and therefore preferred
to stand sentence on the lesser count of rambling into other peoples
compounds out of calling hours Platte forgot about the watch business
after a while and moved downcountry with his regiment Mrs Larkyn
went home when her husbands tour of Indian service expired She never
forgot

But Platte was quite right when he said that the joke had gone too far
The mistrust and the tragedy of itwhich we outsiders cannot see and
do not believe inare killing the Colonels Wife and are making the
Colonel wretched If either of them read this story they can depend
upon its being a fairly true account of the case and can kiss and make
friends

Shakespeare alludes to the pleasure of watching an Engineer being
shelled by his own Battery Now this shows that poets should not write
about what they do not understand Any one could have told him that
Sappers and Gunners are perfectly different branches of the Service
But if you correct the sentence and substitute Gunner for Sapper the
moral comes just the same




THE OTHER MAN

 When the earth was sick and the skies were gray
 And the woods were rotted with rain
 The Dead Man rode through the autumn day
 To visit his love again
 Old Ballad

Far back in the seventies before they had built any Public Offices at
Simla and the broad road round Jakko lived in a pigeonhole in the P
W D hovels her parents made Miss Gaurey marry Colonel Schreiderling
He could not have been MUCH more than thirtyfive years her senior and
as he lived on two hundred rupees a month and had money of his own
he was well off He belonged to good people and suffered in the cold
weather from lung complaints In the hot weather he dangled on the brink
of heatapoplexy but it never quite killed him

Understand I do not blame Schreiderling He was a good husband
according to his lights and his temper only failed him when he was
being nursed Which was some seventeen days in each month He was almost
generous to his wife about money matters and that for him was a
concession Still Mrs Schreiderling was not happy They married her
when she was this side of twenty and had given all her poor little heart
to another man I have forgotten his name but we will call him the
Other Man He had no money and no prospects

He was not even goodlooking and I think he was in the Commissariat or
Transport But in spite of all these things she loved him very
madly and there was some sort of an engagement between the two when
Schreiderling appeared and told Mrs Gaurey that he wished to marry her
daughter Then the other engagement was broken offwashed away by
Mrs Gaureys tears for that lady governed her house by weeping over
disobedience to her authority and the lack of reverence she received
in her old age The daughter did not take after her mother She never
cried Not even at the wedding

The Other Man bore his loss quietly and was transferred to as bad a
station as he could find Perhaps the climate consoled him He suffered
from intermittent fever and that may have distracted him from his other
trouble He was weak about the heart also Both ways One of the valves
was affected and the fever made it worse

This showed itself later on

Then many months passed and Mrs Schreiderling took to being ill

She did not pine away like people in story books but she seemed to pick
up every form of illness that went about a station from simple fever
upwards She was never more than ordinarily pretty at the best of times
and the illness made her ugly Schreiderling said so He prided himself
on speaking his mind

When she ceased being pretty he left her to her own devices and went
back to the lairs of his bachelordom She used to trot up and down Simla
Mall in a forlorn sort of way with a gray Terai hat well on the back of
her head and a shocking bad saddle under her

Schreiderlings generosity stopped at the horse He said that any saddle
would do for a woman as nervous as Mrs Schreiderling She never was
asked to dance because she did not dance well and she was so dull
and uninteresting that her box very seldom had any cards in it
Schreiderling said that if he had known that she was going to be such
a scarecrow after her marriage he would never have married her He
always prided himself on speaking his mind did Schreiderling

He left her at Simla one August and went down to his regiment

Then she revived a little but she never recovered her looks I found
out at the Club that the Other Man is coming up sickvery sickon an
off chance of recovery The fever and the heartvalves had nearly
killed him She knew that too and she knewwhat I had no interest in
knowingwhen he was coming up I suppose he wrote to tell her They had
not seen each other since a month before the wedding And here comes the
unpleasant part of the story

A late call kept me down at the Dovedell Hotel till dusk one evening
Mrs Schreidlerling had been flitting up and down the Mall all the
afternoon in the rain Coming up along the Cartroad a tonga passed me
and my pony tired with standing so long set off at a canter Just by
the road down to the Tonga Office Mrs Schreiderling dripping from head
to foot was waiting for the tonga I turned uphill as the tonga was
no affair of mine and just then she began to shriek I went back at
once and saw under the Tonga Office lamps Mrs Schreiderling kneeling
in the wet road by the back seat of the newlyarrived tonga screaming
hideously

Then she fell face down in the dirt as I came up

Sitting in the back seat very square and firm with one hand on the
awningstanchion and the wet pouring off his hat and moustache was the
Other Mandead The sixtymile uphill jolt had been too much for his
valve I suppose The tongadriver saidThe Sahib died two stages out
of Solon Therefore I tied him with a rope lest he should fall out
by the way and so came to Simla Will the Sahib give me bukshish IT
pointing to the Other Man should have given one rupee

The Other Man sat with a grin on his face as if he enjoyed the joke of
his arrival and Mrs Schreiderling in the mud began to groan There
was no one except us four in the office and it was raining heavily The
first thing was to take Mrs Schreiderling home and the second was to
prevent her name from being mixed up with the affair The tongadriver
received five rupees to find a bazar rickshaw for Mrs Schreiderling
He was to tell the tonga Babu afterwards of the Other Man and the Babu
was to make such arrangements as seemed best

Mrs Schreiderling was carried into the shed out of the rain and for
threequarters of an hour we two waited for the rickshaw The Other
Man was left exactly as he had arrived Mrs Schreiderling would do
everything but cry which might have helped her She tried to scream as
soon as her senses came back and then she began praying for the Other
Mans soul Had she not been as honest as the day she would have prayed
for her own soul too I waited to hear her do this but she did not
Then I tried to get some of the mud off her habit Lastly the rickshaw
came and I got her awaypartly by force It was a terrible business
from beginning to end but most of all when the rickshaw had to squeeze
between the wall and the tonga and she saw by the lamplight that thin
yellow hand grasping the awningstanchion

She was taken home just as every one was going to a dance at Viceregal
LodgePeterhoff it was thenand the doctor found that she had fallen
from her horse that I had picked her up at the back of Jakko and
really deserved great credit for the prompt manner in which I had
secured medical aid She did not diemen of Schreiderlings stamp marry
women who dont die easily They live and grow ugly

She never told of her one meeting since her marriage with the Other
Man and when the chill and cough following the exposure of that
evening allowed her abroad she never by word or sign alluded to having
met me by the Tonga Office Perhaps she never knew

She used to trot up and down the Mall on that shocking bad saddle
looking as if she expected to meet some one round the corner every
minute Two years afterward she went Home and diedat Bournemouth I
think

Schreiderling when he grew maudlin at Mess used to talk about my
poor dear wife He always set great store on speaking his mind did
Schreiderling




CONSEQUENCES

 Rosicrucian subtleties
 In the Orient had rise
 Ye may find their teachers still
 Under Jacatalas Hill

 Seek ye Bombast Paracelsus
 Read what Flood the Seeker tells us
 Of the Dominant that runs
 Through the cycles of the Suns
 Read my story last and see
 Luna at her apogee

There are yearly appointments and twoyearly appointments and
fiveyearly appointments at Simla and there are or used to be
permanent appointments whereon you stayed up for the term of your
natural life and secured red cheeks and a nice income Of course you
could descend in the cold weather for Simla is rather dull then

Tarrion came from goodness knows whereall away and away in some
forsaken part of Central India where they call Pachmari a Sanitarium
and drive behind trotting bullocks I believe He belonged to a
regiment but what he really wanted to do was to escape from his
regiment and live in Simla forever and ever He had no preference for
anything in particular beyond a good horse and a nice partner He
thought he could do everything well which is a beautiful belief when
you hold it with all your heart He was clever in many ways and good to
look at and always made people round him comfortableeven in Central
India

So he went up to Simla and because he was clever and amusing he
gravitated naturally to Mrs Hauksbee who could forgive everything
but stupidity Once he did her great service by changing the date on an
invitationcard for a big dance which Mrs Hauksbee wished to attend
but couldnt because she had quarrelled with the ADC who took
care being a mean man to invite her to a small dance on the 6th
instead of the big Ball of the 26th It was a very clever piece of
forgery and when Mrs Hauksbee showed the ADC her invitationcard
and chaffed him mildly for not better managing his vendettas he really
thought he had made a mistake andwhich was wiserealized that it
was no use to fight with Mrs Hauksbee She was grateful to Tarrion and
asked what she could do for him He said simply Im a Freelance up
here on leave and on the lookout for what I can loot I havent a
square inch of interest in all Simla My name isnt known to any man
with an appointment in his gift and I want an appointmenta good
sound pukka one I believe you can do anything you turn yourself to do
Will you help me Mrs Hauksbee thought for a minute and passed
the last of her ridingwhip through her lips as was her custom when
thinking

Then her eyes sparkled and she saidI will and she shook hands
on it Tarrion having perfect confidence in this great woman took no
further thought of the business at all Except to wonder what sort of an
appointment he would win

Mrs Hauksbee began calculating the prices of all the Heads of
Departments and Members of Council she knew and the more she thought
the more she laughed because her heart was in the game and it amused
her Then she took a Civil List and ran over a few of the appointments
There are some beautiful appointments in the Civil List Eventually she
decided that though Tarrion was too good for the Political Department
she had better begin by trying to get him in there What were her own
plans to this end does not matter in the least for Luck or Fate played
into her hands and she had nothing to do but to watch the course of
events and take the credit of them

All Viceroys when they first come out pass through the Diplomatic
Secrecy craze It wears off in time but they all catch it in the
beginning because they are new to the country

The particular Viceroy who was suffering from the complaint just
thenthis was a long time ago before Lord Dufferin ever came from
Canada or Lord Ripon from the bosom of the English Churchhad it very
badly and the result was that men who were new to keeping official
secrets went about looking unhappy and the Viceroy plumed himself on
the way in which he had instilled notions of reticence into his Staff

Now the Supreme Government have a careless custom of committing
what they do to printed papers These papers deal with all sorts of
thingsfrom the payment of Rs 200 to a secret service native up to
rebukes administered to Vakils and Motamids of Native States and rather
brusque letters to Native Princes telling them to put their houses
in order to refrain from kidnapping women or filling offenders with
pounded red pepper and eccentricities of that kind Of course these
things could never be made public because Native Princes never err
officially and their States are officially as well administered as
Our territories Also the private allowances to various queer people
are not exactly matters to put into newspapers though they give quaint
reading sometimes

When the Supreme Government is at Simla these papers are prepared
there and go round to the people who ought to see them in officeboxes
or by post The principle of secrecy was to that Viceroy quite as
important as the practice and he held that a benevolent despotism like
Ours should never allow even little things such as appointments of
subordinate clerks to leak out till the proper time He was always
remarkable for his principles

There was a very important batch of papers in preparation at that time
It had to travel from one end of Simla to the other by hand

It was not put into an official envelope but a large square palepink
one the matter being in MS on soft crinkly paper It was addressed to
The Head Clerk etc etc Now between The Head Clerk etc etc
and Mrs Hauksbee and a flourish is no very great difference if the
address be written in a very bad hand as this was The chaprassi who
took the envelope was not more of an idiot than most chaprassis He
merely forgot where this most unofficial cover was to be delivered and
so asked the first Englishman he met who happened to be a man riding
down to Annandale in a great hurry The Englishman hardly looked said
Hauksbee Sahib ki Mem and went on So did the chaprassi because that
letter was the last in stock and he wanted to get his work over There
was no book to sign he thrust the letter into Mrs Hauksbees bearers
hands and went off to smoke with a friend

Mrs Hauksbee was expecting some cutout pattern things in flimsy paper
from a friend As soon as she got the big square packet therefore she
said Oh the DEAR creature and tore it open with a paperknife and
all the MS enclosures tumbled out on the floor

Mrs Hauksbee began reading I have said the batch was rather
important That is quite enough for you to know It referred to some
correspondence two measures a peremptory order to a native chief and
two dozen other things Mrs Hauksbee gasped as she read for the first
glimpse of the naked machinery of the Great Indian Government stripped
of its casings and lacquer and paint and guardrails impresses even
the most stupid man And Mrs Hauksbee was a clever woman She was
a little afraid at first and felt as if she had laid hold of a
lightningflash by the tail and did not quite know what to do with it
There were remarks and initials at the side of the papers and some
of the remarks were rather more severe than the papers The initials
belonged to men who are all dead or gone now but they were great in
their day

Mrs Hauksbee read on and thought calmly as she read Then the value of
her trove struck her and she cast about for the best method of using
it Then Tarrion dropped in and they read through all the papers
together and Tarrion not knowing how she had come by them vowed that
Mrs Hauksbee was the greatest woman on earth

Which I believe was true or nearly so

The honest course is always the best said Tarrion after an hour and a
half of study and conversation All things considered the Intelligence
Branch is about my form Either that or the Foreign Office I go to lay
siege to the High Gods in their Temples

He did not seek a little man or a little big man or a weak Head of a
strong Department but he called on the biggest and strongest man that
the Government owned and explained that he wanted an appointment at
Simla on a good salary The compound insolence of this amused the Strong
Man and as he had nothing to do for the moment he listened to the
proposals of the audacious Tarrion

You have I presume some special qualifications besides the gift of
selfassertion for the claims you put forwards said the Strong Man
That Sir said Tarrion is for you to judge Then he began for
he had a good memory quoting a few of the more important notes in the
papersslowly and one by one as a man drops chlorodyne into a glass
When he had reached the peremptory orderand it WAS a peremptory
orderthe Strong Man was troubled

Tarrion wound upAnd I fancy that special knowledge of this kind is
at least as valuable for let us say a berth in the Foreign Office as
the fact of being the nephew of a distinguished officers wife That
hit the Strong Man hard for the last appointment to the Foreign Office
had been by black favor and he knew it Ill see what I can do for
you said the Strong Man Many thanks said Tarrion Then he left
and the Strong Man departed to see how the appointment was to be
blocked

Followed a pause of eleven days with thunders and lightnings and much
telegraphing The appointment was not a very important one carrying
only between Rs 500 and Rs 700 a month but as the Viceroy said it
was the principle of diplomatic secrecy that had to be maintained
and it was more than likely that a boy so well supplied with special
information would be worth translating So they translated him They
must have suspected him though he protested that his information was
due to singular talents of his own Now much of this story including
the afterhistory of the missing envelope you must fill in for
yourself because there are reasons why it cannot be written If you do
not know about things Up Above you wont understand how to fill it in
and you will say it is impossible

What the Viceroy said when Tarrion was introduced to him wasSo this
is the boy who rusked the Government of India is it Recollect Sir
that is not done TWICE So he must have known something

What Tarrion said when he saw his appointment gazetted wasIf Mrs
Hauksbee were twenty years younger and I her husband I should be
Viceroy of India in twenty years

What Mrs Hauksbee said when Tarrion thanked her almost with tears
in his eyes was firstI told you so and next to herselfWhat
fools men are




THE CONVERSION OF AURELIAN McGOGGIN

 Ride with an idle whip ride with an unused heel
 But once in a way there will come a day
 When the colt must be taught to feel
 The lash that falls and the curb that galls
 And the sting of the rowelled steel
 Lifes Handicap

This is not a tale exactly It is a Tract and I am immensely proud of
it Making a Tract is a Feat

Every man is entitled to his own religious opinions but no manleast
of all a juniorhas a right to thrust these down other mens throats
The Government sends out weird Civilians now and again but McGoggin
was the queerest exported for a long time He was cleverbrilliantly
cleverbut his cleverness worked the wrong way Instead of keeping to
the study of the vernaculars he had read some books written by a
man called Comte I think and a man called Spencer and a Professor
Clifford You will find these books in the Library They deal with
peoples insides from the point of view of men who have no stomachs
There was no order against his reading them but his Mamma should have
smacked him

They fermented in his head and he came out to India with a rarefied
religion over and above his work It was not much of a creed It only
proved that men had no souls and there was no God and no hereafter and
that you must worry along somehow for the good of Humanity

One of its minor tenets seemed to be that the one thing more sinful than
giving an order was obeying it At least that was what McGoggin said
but I suspect he had misread his primers

I do not say a word against this creed It was made up in Town where
there is nothing but machinery and asphalt and buildingall shut in
by the fog Naturally a man grows to think that there is no one higher
than himself and that the Metropolitan Board of Works made everything
But in this country where you really see humanityraw brown naked
humanitywith nothing between it and the blazing sky and only the
usedup overhandled earth underfoot the notion somehow dies away
and most folk come back to simpler theories Life in India is not long
enough to waste in proving that there is no one in particular at the
head of affairs

For this reason The Deputy is above the Assistant the Commissioner
above the Deputy the LieutenantGovernor above the Commissioner and
the Viceroy above all four under the orders of the Secretary of State
who is responsible to the Empress If the Empress be not responsible to
her Makerif there is no Maker for her to be responsible tothe
entire system of Our administration must be wrong Which is manifestly
impossible At Home men are to be excused They are stalled up a good
deal and get intellectually beany When you take a gross beany
horse to exercise he slavers and slobbers over the bit till you cant
see the horns

But the bit is there just the same Men do not get beany in India The
climate and the work are against playing bricks with words

If McGoggin had kept his creed with the capital letters and the endings
in isms to himself no one would have cared but his grandfathers on
both sides had been Wesleyan preachers and the preaching strain came
out in his mind He wanted every one at the Club to see that they had no
souls too and to help him to eliminate his Creator As a good many men
told him HE undoubtedly had no soul because he was so young but it
did not follow that his seniors were equally undeveloped and whether
there was another world or not a man still wanted to read his papers in
this But that is not the pointthat is not the point Aurelian used
to say Then men threw sofacushions at him and told him to go to
any particular place he might believe in They christened him the
Blastodermhe said he came from a family of that name somewhere in
the prehistoric agesand by insult and laughter strove to choke him
dumb for he was an unmitigated nuisance at the Club besides being an
offence to the older men His Deputy Commissioner who was working on
the Frontier when Aurelian was rolling on a bedquilt told him that
for a clever boy Aurelian was a very big idiot And you know if
he had gone on with his work he would have been caught up to the
Secretariat in a few years He was just the type that goes thereall
head no physique and a hundred theories Not a soul was interested in
McGoggins soul He might have had two or none or somebodys elses
His business was to obey orders and keep abreast of his files instead of
devastating the Club with isms

He worked brilliantly but he could not accept any order without
trying to better it That was the fault of his creed It made men too
responsible and left too much to their honor You can sometimes ride an
old horse in a halter but never a colt

McGoggin took more trouble over his cases than any of the men of his
year He may have fancied that thirtypage judgments on fiftyrupee
casesboth sides perjured to the gulletadvanced the cause of
Humanity At any rate he worked too much and worried and fretted over
the rebukes he received and lectured away on his ridiculous creed out
of office till the Doctor had to warn him that he was overdoing it No
man can toil eighteen annas in the rupee in June without suffering But
McGoggin was still intellectually beany and proud of himself and his
powers and he would take no hint He worked nine hours a day steadily

Very well said the doctor youll break down because you are
overengined for your beam McGoggin was a little chap

One day the collapse cameas dramatically as if it had been meant to
embellish a Tract

It was just before the Rains We were sitting in the verandah in the
dead hot close air gasping and praying that the blackblue clouds
would let down and bring the cool Very very far away there was a
faint whisper which was the roar of the Rains breaking over the river
One of the men heard it got out of his chair listened and said
naturally enoughThank God

Then the Blastoderm turned in his place and saidWhy I assure you
its only the result of perfectly natural causesatmospheric phenomena
of the simplest kind Why you should therefore return thanks to a
Being who never did existwho is only a figment

Blastoderm grunted the man in the next chair dry up and throw
me over the Pioneer We know all about your figments The Blastoderm
reached out to the table took up one paper and jumped as if something
had stung him Then he handed the paper over

As I was saying he went on slowly and with an effortdue to
perfectly natural causesperfectly natural causes I mean

Hi Blastoderm youve given me the Calcutta Mercantile Advertiser

The dust got up in little whorls while the treetops rocked and the
kites whistled But no one was looking at the coming of the Rains

We were all staring at the Blastoderm who had risen from his chair and
was fighting with his speech Then he said still more slowly

Perfectly conceivabledictionaryred
oakamenablecauseretainingshuttlecockalone

Blastoderms drunk said one man But the Blastoderm was not drunk He
looked at us in a dazed sort of way and began motioning with his hands
in the half light as the clouds closed overhead

Thenwith a scream

What is itCantreserveattainablemarketobscure

But his speech seemed to freeze in him andjust as the lightning shot
two tongues that cut the whole sky into three pieces and the rain fell
in quivering sheetsthe Blastoderm was struck dumb He stood pawing and
champing like a hardheld horse and his eyes were full of terror

The Doctor came over in three minutes and heard the story Its
aphasia he said Take him to his room I KNEW the smash would come
We carried the Blastoderm across in the pouring rain to his quarters
and the Doctor gave him bromide of potassium to make him sleep

Then the Doctor came back to us and told us that aphasia was like all
the arrears of Punjab Head falling in a lump and that only once
beforein the case of a sepoyhad he met with so complete a case
I myself have seen mild aphasia in an overworked man but this sudden
dumbness was uncannythough as the Blastoderm himself might have said
due to perfectly natural causes

Hell have to take leave after this said the Doctor He wont be
fit for work for another three months No it isnt insanity or anything
like it Its only complete loss of control over the speech and memory
I fancy it will keep the Blastoderm quiet though

Two days later the Blastoderm found his tongue again The first
question he asked was What was it The Doctor enlightened him

But I cant understand it said the Blastoderm Im quite sane but I
cant be sure of my mind it seemsmy OWN memorycan I

Go up into the Hills for three months and dont think about it said
the Doctor

But I cant understand it repeated the Blastoderm It was my OWN
mind and memory

I cant help it said the Doctor there are a good many things you
cant understand and by the time you have put in my length of service
youll know exactly how much a man dare call his own in this world

The stroke cowed the Blastoderm He could not understand it He went
into the Hills in fear and trembling wondering whether he would be
permitted to reach the end of any sentence he began

This gave him a wholesome feeling of mistrust The legitimate
explanation that he had been overworking himself failed to satisfy
him Something had wiped his lips of speech as a mother wipes the milky
lips of her child and he was afraidhorribly afraid

So the Club had rest when he returned and if ever you come across
Aurelian McGoggin laying down the law on things Humanhe doesnt seem
to know as much as he used to about things Divineput your forefinger
on your lip for a moment and see what happens

Dont blame me if he throws a glass at your head




A GERM DESTROYER

 Pleasant it is for the Little Tin Gods
 When great Jove nods
 But Little Tin Gods make their little mistakes
 In missing the hour when great Jove wakes

As a general rule it is inexpedient to meddle with questions of State
in a land where men are highly paid to work them out for you

This tale is a justifiable exception

Once in every five years as you know we indent for a new Viceroy and
each Viceroy imports with the rest of his baggage a Private Secretary
who may or may not be the real Viceroy just as Fate ordains Fate looks
after the Indian Empire because it is so big and so helpless

There was a Viceroy once who brought out with him a turbulent Private
Secretarya hard man with a soft manner and a morbid passion for
work This Secretary was called WonderJohn Fennil Wonder The Viceroy
possessed no namenothing but a string of counties and twothirds
of the alphabet after them He said in confidence that he was the
electroplated figurehead of a golden administration and he watched
in a dreamy amused way Wonders attempts to draw matters which were
entirely outside his province into his own hands When we are all
cherubims together said His Excellency once my dear good friend
Wonder will head the conspiracy for plucking out Gabriels tailfeathers
or stealing Peters keys THEN I shall report him

But though the Viceroy did nothing to check Wonders officiousness
other people said unpleasant things Maybe the Members of Council began
it but finally all Simla agreed that there was too much Wonder
and too little Viceroy in that regime Wonder was always quoting His
Excellency It was His Excellency this His Excellency that In
the opinion of His Excellency and so on The Viceroy smiled but he
did not heed

He said that so long as his old men squabbled with his dear good
Wonder they might be induced to leave the Immemorial East in peace

No wise man has a policy said the Viceroy A Policy is the blackmail
levied on the Fool by the Unforeseen I am not the former and I do not
believe in the latter

I do not quite see what this means unless it refers to an Insurance
Policy Perhaps it was the Viceroys way of sayingLie low

That season came up to Simla one of these crazy people with only a
single idea These are the men who make things move but they are not
nice to talk to This mans name was Mellish and he had lived for
fifteen years on land of his own in Lower Bengal studying cholera He
held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a
muggy atmosphere and stuck in the branches of trees like a woolflake
The germ could be rendered sterile he said by Mellishs Own
Invincible Fumigatorya heavy violetblack powderthe result of
fifteen years scientific investigation Sir

Inventors seem very much alike as a caste They talk loudly especially
about conspiracies of monopolists they beat upon the table with
their fists and they secrete fragments of their inventions about their
persons

Mellish said that there was a Medical Ring at Simla headed by the
SurgeonGeneral who was in league apparently with all the Hospital
Assistants in the Empire I forget exactly how he proved it but it had
something to do with skulking up to the Hills and what Mellish
wanted was the independent evidence of the ViceroySteward of our
Most Gracious Majesty the Queen Sir So Mellish went up to Simla with
eightyfour pounds of Fumigatory in his trunk to speak to the Viceroy
and to show him the merits of the invention

But it is easier to see a Viceroy than to talk to him unless you chance
to be as important as Mellishe of Madras He was a sixthousandrupee
man so great that his daughters never married They contracted
alliances He himself was not paid He received emoluments and his
journeys about the country were tours of observation His business was
to stir up the people in Madras with a long poleas you stir up stench
in a pondand the people had to come up out of their comfortable old
ways and gaspThis is Enlightenment and progress Isnt it fine
Then they gave Mellishe statues and jasmine garlands in the hope of
getting rid of him

Mellishe came up to Simla to confer with the Viceroy That was one of
his perquisites The Viceroy knew nothing of Mellishe except that he was
one of those middleclass deities who seem necessary to the spiritual
comfort of this Paradise of the Middleclasses and that in all
probability he had suggested designed founded and endowed all the
public institutions in Madras Which proves that His Excellency though
dreamy had experience of the ways of sixthousandrupee men

Mellishes name was E Mellishe and Mellishs was E S Mellish and
they were both staying at the same hotel and the Fate that looks after
the Indian Empire ordained that Wonder should blunder and drop the final
e that the Chaprassi should help him and that the note which ran
Dear Mr MellishCan you set aside your other engagements and lunch
with us at two tomorrow His Excellency has an hour at your disposal
then should be given to Mellish with the Fumigatory He nearly wept
with pride and delight and at the appointed hour cantered off to
Peterhoff a big paperbag full of the Fumigatory in his coattail
pockets He had his chance and he meant to make the most of
it Mellishe of Madras had been so portentously solemn about his
conference that Wonder had arranged for a private tiffinno
ADCs no Wonder no one but the Viceroy who said plaintively
that he feared being left alone with unmuzzled autocrats like the great
Mellishe of Madras

But his guest did not bore the Viceroy On the contrary he amused him
Mellish was nervously anxious to go straight to his Fumigatory and
talked at random until tiffin was over and His Excellency asked him
to smoke The Viceroy was pleased with Mellish because he did not talk
shop

As soon as the cheroots were lit Mellish spoke like a man beginning
with his choleratheory reviewing his fifteen years scientific
labors the machinations of the Simla Ring and the excellence of
his Fumigatory while the Viceroy watched him between halfshut eyes
and thought Evidently this is the wrong tiger but it is an original
animal Mellishs hair was standing on end with excitement and he
stammered He began groping in his coattails and before the Viceroy
knew what was about to happen he had tipped a bagful of his powder into
the big silver ashtray

Jjjudge for yourself Sir said Mellish Y Excellency shall judge
for yourself Absolutely infallible on my honor

He plunged the lighted end of his cigar into the powder which began to
smoke like a volcano and send up fat greasy wreaths of coppercolored
smoke In five seconds the room was filled with a most pungent and
sickening stencha reek that took fierce hold of the trap of your
windpipe and shut it The powder then hissed and fizzed and sent out
blue and green sparks and the smoke rose till you could neither see
nor breathe nor gasp Mellish however was used to it

Nitrate of strontia he shouted baryta bonemeal etcetera
Thousand cubic feet smoke per cubic inch Not a germ could livenot a
germ Y Excellency

But His Excellency had fled and was coughing at the foot of the stairs
while all Peterhoff hummed like a hive Red Lancers came in and the
Head Chaprassi who speaks English came in and macebearers came in
and ladies ran downstairs screaming fire for the smoke was drifting
through the house and oozing out of the windows and bellying along the
verandahs and wreathing and writhing across the gardens No one could
enter the room where Mellish was lecturing on his Fumigatory till that
unspeakable powder had burned itself out

Then an AidedeCamp who desired the V C rushed through the rolling
clouds and hauled Mellish into the hall The Viceroy was prostrate with
laughter and could only waggle his hands feebly at Mellish who was
shaking a fresh bagful of powder at him

Glorious Glorious sobbed his Excellency Not a germ as you justly
observe could exist I can swear it A magnificent success

Then he laughed till the tears came and Wonder who had caught the real
Mellishe snorting on the Mall entered and was deeply shocked at the
scene But the Viceroy was delighted because he saw that Wonder would
presently depart Mellish with the Fumigatory was also pleased for he
felt that he had smashed the Simla Medical Ring

Few men could tell a story like His Excellency when he took the trouble
and the account of my dear good Wonders friend with the powder
went the round of Simla and flippant folk made Wonder unhappy by their
remarks

But His Excellency told the tale once too oftenfor Wonder As he meant
to do It was at a Seepee Picnic Wonder was sitting just behind the
Viceroy

And I really thought for a moment wound up His Excellency that my
dear good Wonder had hired an assassin to clear his way to the throne

Every one laughed but there was a delicate subtinkle in the Viceroys
tone which Wonder understood He found that his health was giving way
and the Viceroy allowed him to go and presented him with a flaming
character for use at Home among big people

My fault entirely said His Excellency in after seasons with
a twinkling in his eye My inconsistency must always have been
distasteful to such a masterly man




KIDNAPPED

 There is a tide in the affairs of men
 Which taken any way you please is bad
 And strands them in forsaken guts and creeks
 No decent soul would think of visiting

 You cannot stop the tide but now and then
 You may arrest some rash adventurer
 Whohmwill hardly thank you for your pains
 Vibarts Moralities

We are a highcaste and enlightened race and infantmarriage is very
shocking and the consequences are sometimes peculiar but nevertheless
the Hindu notionwhich is the Continental notionwhich is the
aboriginal notionof arranging marriages irrespective of the personal
inclinations of the married is sound Think for a minute and you will
see that it must be so unless of course you believe in affinities
In which case you had better not read this tale How can a man who has
never married who cannot be trusted to pick up at sight a moderately
sound horse whose head is hot and upset with visions of domestic
felicity go about the choosing of a wife He cannot see straight or
think straight if he tries and the same disadvantages exist in the
case of a girls fancies But when mature married and discreet people
arrange a match between a boy and a girl they do it sensibly with a
view to the future and the young couple live happily ever afterwards
As everybody knows

Properly speaking Government should establish a Matrimonial Department
efficiently officered with a Jury of Matrons a Judge of the Chief
Court a Senior Chaplain and an Awful Warning in the shape of a
lovematch that has gone wrong chained to the trees in the courtyard
All marriages should be made through the Department which might be
subordinate to the Educational Department under the same penalty as
that attaching to the transfer of land without a stamped document But
Government wont take suggestions It pretends that it is too busy
However I will put my notion on record and explain the example that
illustrates the theory

Once upon a time there was a good young mana firstclass officer in
his own Departmenta man with a career before him and possibly a K
C G E at the end of it All his superiors spoke well of him because
he knew how to hold his tongue and his pen at the proper times There
are today only eleven men in India who possess this secret and they
have all with one exception attained great honor and enormous incomes

This good young man was quiet and selfcontainedtoo old for his years
by far Which always carries its own punishment Had a Subaltern or a
TeaPlanters Assistant or anybody who enjoys life and has no care for
tomorrow done what he tried to do not a soul would have cared But when
Peythroppethe estimable virtuous economical quiet hardworking
young Peythroppefell there was a flutter through five Departments

The manner of his fall was in this way He met a Miss
CastriesdCastries it was originally but the family dropped the
d for administrative reasonsand he fell in love with her even more
energetically than he worked Understand clearly that there was not a
breath of a word to be said against Miss Castriesnot a shadow of a
breath She was good and very lovelypossessed what innocent people at
home call a Spanish complexion with thick blueblack hair growing low
down on her forehead into a widows peak and big violet eyes
under eyebrows as black and as straight as the borders of a Gazette
Extraordinary when a big man dies Butbutbut Well she was a VERY
sweet girl and very pious but for many reasons she was impossible
Quite so All good Mammas know what impossible means It was obviously
absurd that Peythroppe should marry her The little opaltinted onyx
at the base of her fingernails said this as plainly as print
Further marriage with Miss Castries meant marriage with several other
CastriesHonorary Lieutenant Castries her Papa Mrs Eulalie Castries
her Mamma and all the ramifications of the Castries family on incomes
ranging from Rs 175 to Rs 470 a month and THEIR wives and connections
again

It would have been cheaper for Peythroppe to have assaulted a
Commissioner with a dogwhip or to have burned the records of a Deputy
Commissioners Office than to have contracted an alliance with the
Castries It would have weighted his aftercareer lesseven under a
Government which never forgets and NEVER forgives

Everybody saw this but Peythroppe He was going to marry Miss Castries
he wasbeing of age and drawing a good incomeand woe betide the house
that would not afterwards receive Mrs Virginie Saulez Peythroppe with
the deference due to her husbands rank

That was Peythroppes ultimatum and any remonstrance drove him frantic

These sudden madnesses most afflict the sanest men There was a case
oncebut I will tell you of that later on You cannot account for the
mania except under a theory directly contradicting the one about the
Place wherein marriages are made Peythroppe was burningly anxious to
put a millstone round his neck at the outset of his career and argument
had not the least effect on him He was going to marry Miss Castries
and the business was his own business

He would thank you to keep your advice to yourself With a man in this
condition mere words only fix him in his purpose Of course he cannot
see that marriage out here does not concern the individual but the
Government he serves

Do you remember Mrs Hauksbeethe most wonderful woman in India She
saved Pluffles from Mrs Reiver won Tarrion his appointment in the
Foreign Office and was defeated in open field by Mrs CusackBremmil
She heard of the lamentable condition of Peythroppe and her brain
struck out the plan that saved him She had the wisdom of the Serpent
the logical coherence of the Man the fearlessness of the Child and
the triple intuition of the Woman Neverno neveras long as a tonga
buckets down the Solon dip or the couples go ariding at the back of
Summer Hill will there be such a genius as Mrs Hauksbee She attended
the consultation of Three Men on Peythroppes case and she stood up
with the lash of her ridingwhip between her lips and spake


Three weeks later Peythroppe dined with the Three Men and the Gazette
of India came in Peythroppe found to his surprise that he had been
gazetted a months leave Dont ask me how this was managed I believe
firmly that if Mrs Hauksbee gave the order the whole Great Indian
Administration would stand on its head

The Three Men had also a months leave each Peythroppe put the Gazette
down and said bad words Then there came from the compound the soft
padpad of camelsthieves camels the bikaneer breed that dont
bubble and howl when they sit down and get up

After that I dont know what happened This much is certain

Peythroppe disappearedvanished like smokeand the long footrest
chair in the house of the Three Men was broken to splinters Also a
bedstead departed from one of the bedrooms

Mrs Hauksbee said that Mr Peythroppe was shooting in Rajputana with
the Three Men so we were compelled to believe her

At the end of the month Peythroppe was gazetted twenty days extension
of leave but there was wrath and lamentation in the house of Castries
The marriageday had been fixed but the bridegroom never came and the
DSilvas Pereiras and Ducketts lifted their voices and mocked Honorary
Lieutenant Castries as one who had been basely imposed upon Mrs
Hauksbee went to the wedding and was much astonished when Peythroppe
did not appear After seven weeks Peythroppe and the Three Men returned
from Rajputana Peythroppe was in hard tough condition rather white
and more selfcontained than ever

One of the Three Men had a cut on his nose cause by the kick of a gun
Twelvebores kick rather curiously

Then came Honorary Lieutenant Castries seeking for the blood of his
perfidious soninlaw to be He said thingsvulgar and impossible
things which showed the raw rough ranker below the Honorary and I
fancy Peythroppes eyes were opened Anyhow he held his peace till the
end when he spoke briefly Honorary Lieutenant Castries asked for a
peg before he went away to die or bring a suit for breach of promise

Miss Castries was a very good girl She said that she would have no
breach of promise suits She said that if she was not a lady she
was refined enough to know that ladies kept their broken hearts to
themselves and as she ruled her parents nothing happened Later on
she married a most respectable and gentlemanly person He travelled for
an enterprising firm in Calcutta and was all that a good husband should
be

So Peythroppe came to his right mind again and did much good work and
was honored by all who knew him One of these days he will marry but he
will marry a sweet pinkandwhite maiden on the Government House List
with a little money and some influential connections as every wise man
should And he will never all his life tell her what happened during
the seven weeks of his shootingtour in Rajputana

But just think how much trouble and expensefor camel hire is not
cheap and those Bikaneer brutes had to be fed like humansmight have
been saved by a properly conducted Matrimonial Department under the
control of the Director General of Education but corresponding direct
with the Viceroy

 The Unedited Autobiography of Private Ortheris

IF there was one thing on which Golightly prided himself more than
another it was looking like an Officer and a gentleman He said it
was for the honor of the Service that he attired himself so elaborately
but those who knew him best said that it was just personal vanity There
was no harm about Golightlynot an ounce

He recognized a horse when he saw one and could do more than fill a
cantle He played a very fair game at billiards and was a sound man at
the whisttable Everyone liked him and nobody ever dreamed of seeing
him handcuffed on a station platform as a deserter But this sad thing
happened

He was going down from Dalhousie at the end of his leaveriding down
He had cut his leave as fine as he dared and wanted to come down in a
hurry

It was fairly warm at Dalhousie and knowing what to expect below he
descended in a new khaki suittight fittingof a delicate olivegreen
a peacockblue tie white collar and a snowy white solah helmet He
prided himself on looking neat even when he was riding post He did
look neat and he was so deeply concerned about his appearance before he
started that he quite forgot to take anything but some small change with
him He left all his notes at the hotel His servants had gone down the
road before him to be ready in waiting at Pathankote with a change of
gear That was what he called travelling in light marchingorder He
was proud of his faculty of organizationwhat we call bundobust

Twentytwo miles out of Dalhousie it began to rainnot a mere
hillshower but a good tepid monsoonish downpour Golightly bustled
on wishing that he had brought an umbrella The dust on the roads
turned into mud and the pony mired a good deal So did Golightlys
khaki gaiters But he kept on steadily and tried to think how pleasant
the coolth was

His next pony was rather a brute at starting and Golightlys hands
being slippery with the rain contrived to get rid of Golightly at a
corner He chased the animal caught it and went ahead briskly

The spill had not improved his clothes or his temper and he had lost
one spur He kept the other one employed By the time that stage was
ended the pony had had as much exercise as he wanted and in spite of
the rain Golightly was sweating freely At the end of another miserable
halfhour Golightly found the world disappear before his eyes in clammy
pulp The rain had turned the pith of his huge and snowy solahtopee
into an evilsmelling dough and it had closed on his head like a
halfopened mushroom Also the green lining was beginning to run

Golightly did not say anything worth recording here He tore off and
squeezed up as much of the brim as was in his eyes and ploughed on The
back of the helmet was flapping on his neck and the sides stuck to
his ears but the leather band and green lining kept things roughly
together so that the hat did not actually melt away where it flapped

Presently the pulp and the green stuff made a sort of slimy mildew
which ran over Golightly in several directionsdown his back and
bosom for choice The khaki color ran tooit was really shockingly bad
dyeand sections of Golightly were brown and patches were violet
and contours were ochre and streaks were ruddy red and blotches were
nearly white according to the nature and peculiarities of the dye
When he took out his handkerchief to wipe his face and the green of the
hatlining and the purple stuff that had soaked through on to his neck
from the tie became thoroughly mixed the effect was amazing

Near Dhar the rain stopped and the evening sun came out and dried him up
slightly It fixed the colors too Three miles from Pathankote the last
pony fell dead lame and Golightly was forced to walk He pushed on
into Pathankote to find his servants He did not know then that his
khitmatgar had stopped by the roadside to get drunk and would come on
the next day saying that he had sprained his ankle When he got into
Pathankote he couldnt find his servants his boots were stiff and ropy
with mud and there were large quantities of dirt about his body The
blue tie had run as much as the khaki So he took it off with the collar
and threw it away Then he said something about servants generally and
tried to get a peg He paid eight annas for the drink and this revealed
to him that he had only six annas more in his pocketor in the world as
he stood at that hour

He went to the StationMaster to negotiate for a firstclass ticket to
Khasa where he was stationed The bookingclerk said something to
the StationMaster the StationMaster said something to the Telegraph
Clerk and the three looked at him with curiosity They asked him to
wait for halfanhour while they telegraphed to Umritsar for
authority So he waited and four constables came and grouped themselves
picturesquely round him Just as he was preparing to ask them to go
away the StationMaster said that he would give the Sahib a ticket
to Umritsar if the Sahib would kindly come inside the bookingoffice
Golightly stepped inside and the next thing he knew was that a
constable was attached to each of his legs and arms while the
StationMaster was trying to cram a mailbag over his head

There was a very fair scuffle all round the bookingoffice and
Golightly received a nasty cut over his eye through falling against
a table But the constables were too much for him and they and the
StationMaster handcuffed him securely As soon as the mailbag was
slipped he began expressing his opinions and the headconstable
saidWithout doubt this is the soldierEnglishman we required Listen
to the abuse Then Golightly asked the StationMaster what the this
and the that the proceedings meant The StationMaster told him he was
Private John Binkle of theRegiment 5 ft 9 in fair hair gray
eyes and a dissipated appearance no marks on the body who had
deserted a fortnight ago Golightly began explaining at great length
and the more he explained the less the StationMaster believed him He
said that no Lieutenant could look such a ruffian as did Golightly and
that his instructions were to send his capture under proper escort to
Umritsar Golightly was feeling very damp and uncomfortable and the
language he used was not fit for publication even in an expurgated
form The four constables saw him safe to Umritsar in an intermediate
compartment and he spent the fourhour journey in abusing them as
fluently as his knowledge of the vernaculars allowed

At Umritsar he was bundled out on the platform into the arms of a
Corporal and two men of theRegiment Golightly drew himself up
and tried to carry off matters jauntily He did not feel too jaunty in
handcuffs with four constables behind him and the blood from the
cut on his forehead stiffening on his left cheek The Corporal was not
jocular either Golightly got as far asThis is a very absurd mistake
my men when the Corporal told him to stow his lip and come along
Golightly did not want to come along He desired to stop and explain
He explained very well indeed until the Corporal cut in withYOU
a orficer Its the like o YOU as brings disgrace on the likes of US
Bloomin fine orficer you are I know your regiment The Rogues
March is the quickstep where you come from Youre a black shame to the
Service

Golightly kept his temper and began explaining all over again from the
beginning Then he was marched out of the rain into the refreshmentroom
and told not to make a qualified fool of himself

The men were going to run him up to Fort Govindghar And running up is
a performance almost as undignified as the Frog March

Golightly was nearly hysterical with rage and the chill and the mistake
and the handcuffs and the headache that the cut on his forehead had
given him He really laid himself out to express what was in his mind
When he had quite finished and his throat was feeling dry one of the
men saidIve eard a few beggars in the click blind stiff and crack
on a bit but Ive never eard any one to touch this ere orficer
They were not angry with him They rather admired him They had some
beer at the refreshmentroom and offered Golightly some too because
he had swore wonerful They asked him to tell them all about the
adventures of Private John Binkle while he was loose on the countryside
and that made Golightly wilder than ever If he had kept his wits about
him he would have kept quiet until an officer came but he attempted to
run

Now the butt of a Martini in the small of your back hurts a great deal
and rotten rainsoaked khaki tears easily when two men are jerking at
your collar

Golightly rose from the floor feeling very sick and giddy with his
shirt ripped open all down his breast and nearly all down his back

He yielded to his luck and at that point the downtrain from Lahore
came in carrying one of Golightlys Majors

This is the Majors evidence in full

There was the sound of a scuffle in the secondclass refreshmentroom
so I went in and saw the most villainous loafer that I ever set eyes on
His boots and breeches were plastered with mud and beerstains He wore
a muddywhite dunghill sort of thing on his head and it hung down in
slips on his shoulders which were a good deal scratched He was half in
and half out of a shirt as nearly in two pieces as it could be and he
was begging the guard to look at the name on the tail of it As he had
rucked the shirt all over his head I couldnt at first see who he was
but I fancied that he was a man in the first stage of D T from the way
he swore while he wrestled with his rags When he turned round and I
had made allowance for a lump as big as a porkpie over one eye and
some green warpaint on the face and some violet stripes round the
neck I saw that it was Golightly He was very glad to see me said the
Major and he hoped I would not tell the Mess about it I didnt but
you can if you like now that Golightly has gone Home

Golightly spent the greater part of that summer in trying to get the
Corporal and the two soldiers tried by CourtMartial for arresting an
officer and a gentleman They were of course very sorry for their
error But the tale leaked into the regimental canteen and thence ran
about the Province




THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO

 A stones throw out on either hand
 From that wellordered road we tread
 And all the world is wild and strange
 Churel and ghoul and Djinn and sprite
 Shall bear us company tonight
 For we have reached the Oldest Land
 Wherein the Powers of Darkness range
 From the Dusk to the Dawn

The house of Suddhoo near the Taksali Gate is twostoried with four
carved windows of old brown wood and a flat roof You may recognize
it by five red handprints arranged like the Five of Diamonds on the
whitewash between the upper windows Bhagwan Dass the bunnia and a
man who says he gets his living by sealcutting live in the lower story
with a troop of wives servants friends and retainers The two upper
rooms used to be occupied by Janoo and Azizun and a little blackandtan
terrier that was stolen from an Englishmans house and given to Janoo by
a soldier Today only Janoo lives in the upper rooms Suddhoo sleeps on
the roof generally except when he sleeps in the street He used to go
to Peshawar in the cold weather to visit his son who sells curiosities
near the Edwardes Gate and then he slept under a real mud roof

Suddhoo is a great friend of mine because his cousin had a son who
secured thanks to my recommendation the post of headmessenger to
a big firm in the Station Suddhoo says that God will make me a
LieutenantGovernor one of these days I daresay his prophecy will come
true He is very very old with white hair and no teeth worth showing
and he has outlived his witsoutlived nearly everything except his
fondness for his son at Peshawar Janoo and Azizun are Kashmiris
Ladies of the City and theirs was an ancient and more or less honorable
profession but Azizun has since married a medical student from the
NorthWest and has settled down to a most respectable life somewhere
near Bareilly Bhagwan Dass is an extortionate and an adulterator He
is very rich The man who is supposed to get his living by sealcutting
pretends to be very poor

This lets you know as much as is necessary of the four principal tenants
in the house of Suddhoo Then there is Me of course but I am only the
chorus that comes in at the end to explain things So I do not count

Suddhoo was not clever The man who pretended to cut seals was the
cleverest of them allBhagwan Dass only knew how to lieexcept Janoo
She was also beautiful but that was her own affair

Suddhoos son at Peshawar was attacked by pleurisy and old Suddhoo
was troubled The sealcutter man heard of Suddhoos anxiety and made
capital out of it He was abreast of the times He got a friend in
Peshawar to telegraph daily accounts of the sons health

And here the story begins

Suddhoos cousins son told me one evening that Suddhoo wanted to see
me that he was too old and feeble to come personally and that I should
be conferring an everlasting honor on the House of Suddhoo if I went to
him I went but I think seeing how welloff Suddhoo was then that he
might have sent something better than an ekka which jolted fearfully
to haul out a future LieutenantGovernor to the City on a muggy April
evening The ekka did not run quickly

It was full dark when we pulled up opposite the door of Ranjit Singhs
Tomb near the main gate of the Fort Here was Suddhoo and he said that
by reason of my condescension it was absolutely certain that I should
become a LieutenantGovernor while my hair was yet black Then we talked
about the weather and the state of my health and the wheat crops for
fifteen minutes in the Huzuri Bagh under the stars

Suddhoo came to the point at last He said that Janoo had told him that
there was an order of the Sirkar against magic because it was feared
that magic might one day kill the Empress of India I didnt know
anything about the state of the law but I fancied that something
interesting was going to happen I said that so far from magic being
discouraged by the Government it was highly commended

The greatest officials of the State practiced it themselves If
the Financial Statement isnt magic I dont know what is Then to
encourage him further I said that if there was any jadoo afoot I had
not the least objection to giving it my countenance and sanction and to
seeing that it was clean jadoowhite magic as distinguished from
the unclean jadoo which kills folk It took a long time before Suddhoo
admitted that this was just what he had asked me to come for Then he
told me in jerks and quavers that the man who said he cut seals was
a sorcerer of the cleanest kind that every day he gave Suddhoo news of
the sick son in Peshawar more quickly than the lightning could fly and
that this news was always corroborated by the letters Further that he
had told Suddhoo how a great danger was threatening his son which could
be removed by clean jadoo and of course heavy payment I began to see
how the land lay and told Suddhoo that I also understood a little jadoo
in the Western line and would go to his house to see that everything
was done decently and in order We set off together and on the way
Suddhoo told me he had paid the sealcutter between one hundred and
two hundred rupees already and the jadoo of that night would cost two
hundred more Which was cheap he said considering the greatness of his
sons danger but I do not think he meant it

The lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when we arrived I
could hear awful noises from behind the sealcutters shopfront as if
some one were groaning his soul out Suddhoo shook all over and while
we groped our way upstairs told me that the jadoo had begun Janoo and
Azizun met us at the stairhead and told us that the jadoowork was
coming off in their rooms because there was more space there Janoo is
a lady of a freethinking turn of mind She whispered that the jadoo was
an invention to get money out of Suddhoo and that the sealcutter would
go to a hot place when he died Suddhoo was nearly crying with fear
and old age He kept walking up and down the room in the half light
repeating his sons name over and over again and asking Azizun if
the sealcutter ought not to make a reduction in the case of his own
landlord

Janoo pulled me over to the shadow in the recess of the carved
bowwindows The boards were up and the rooms were only lit by one tiny
lamp There was no chance of my being seen if I stayed still

Presently the groans below ceased and we heard steps on the staircase
That was the sealcutter He stopped outside the door as the terrier
barked and Azizun fumbled at the chain and he told Suddhoo to blow out
the lamp This left the place in jet darkness except for the red glow
from the two huqas that belonged to Janoo and Azizun The sealcutter
came in and I heard Suddhoo throw himself down on the floor and groan
Azizun caught her breath and Janoo backed to one of the beds with a
shudder There was a clink of something metallic and then shot up a
pale bluegreen flame near the ground The light was just enough to show
Azizun pressed against one corner of the room with the terrier between
her knees Janoo with her hands clasped leaning forward as she sat on
the bed Suddhoo face down quivering and the sealcutter

I hope I may never see another man like that sealcutter He was
stripped to the waist with a wreath of white jasmine as thick as my
wrist round his forehead a salmoncolored loincloth round his middle
and a steel bangle on each ankle This was not aweinspiring It was
the face of the man that turned me cold It was bluegray in the first
place In the second the eyes were rolled back till you could only
see the whites of them and in the third the face was the face of
a demona ghoulanything you please except of the sleek oily old
ruffian who sat in the daytime over his turninglathe downstairs He
was lying on his stomach with his arms turned and crossed behind him
as if he had been thrown down pinioned His head and neck were the only
parts of him off the floor They were nearly at right angles to the
body like the head of a cobra at spring It was ghastly In the centre
of the room on the bare earth floor stood a big deep brass basin
with a pale bluegreen light floating in the centre like a nightlight
Round that basin the man on the floor wriggled himself three times How
he did it I do not know I could see the muscles ripple along his spine
and fall smooth again but I could not see any other motion

The head seemed the only thing alive about him except that slow
curl and uncurl of the laboring backmuscles Janoo from the bed was
breathing seventy to the minute Azizun held her hands before her eyes
and old Suddhoo fingering at the dirt that had got into his white
beard was crying to himself The horror of it was that the creeping
crawly thing made no soundonly crawled And remember this lasted for
ten minutes while the terrier whined and Azizun shuddered and Janoo
gasped and Suddhoo cried

I felt the hair lift at the back of my head and my heart thump like a
thermantidote paddle Luckily the sealcutter betrayed himself by his
most impressive trick and made me calm again After he had finished that
unspeakable triple crawl he stretched his head away from the floor as
high as he could and sent out a jet of fire from his nostrils Now I
knew how firespouting is doneI can do it myselfso I felt at ease
The business was a fraud If he had only kept to that crawl without
trying to raise the effect goodness knows what I might not have
thought Both the girls shrieked at the jet of fire and the head
dropped chin down on the floor with a thud the whole body lying then
like a corpse with its arms trussed

There was a pause of five full minutes after this and the bluegreen
flame died down Janoo stooped to settle one of her anklets while
Azizun turned her face to the wall and took the terrier in her arms
Suddhoo put out an arm mechanically to Janoos huqa and she slid it
across the floor with her foot Directly above the body and on the wall
were a couple of flaming portraits in stamped paper frames of the
Queen and the Prince of Wales They looked down on the performance and
to my thinking seemed to heighten the grotesqueness of it all

Just when the silence was getting unendurable the body turned over and
rolled away from the basin to the side of the room where it lay stomach
up There was a faint plop from the basinexactly like the noise
a fish makes when it takes a flyand the green light in the centre
revived

I looked at the basin and saw bobbing in the water the dried
shrivelled black head of a native babyopen eyes open mouth and
shaved scalp It was worse being so very sudden than the crawling
exhibition We had no time to say anything before it began to speak

Read Poes account of the voice that came from the mesmerized dying man
and you will realize less than onehalf of the horror of that heads
voice

There was an interval of a second or two between each word and a sort
of ring ring ring in the note of the voice like the timbre of a
bell It pealed slowly as if talking to itself for several minutes
before I got rid of my cold sweat Then the blessed solution struck me
I looked at the body lying near the doorway and saw just where the
hollow of the throat joins on the shoulders a muscle that had nothing
to do with any mans regular breathing twitching away steadily The
whole thing was a careful reproduction of the Egyptian teraphin that
one read about sometimes and the voice was as clever and as appalling a
piece of ventriloquism as one could wish to hear All this time the head
was lipliplapping against the side of the basin and speaking It
told Suddhoo on his face again whining of his sons illness and of
the state of the illness up to the evening of that very night I always
shall respect the sealcutter for keeping so faithfully to the time
of the Peshawar telegrams It went on to say that skilled doctors were
night and day watching over the mans life and that he would eventually
recover if the fee to the potent sorcerer whose servant was the head in
the basin were doubled

Here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in To ask for
twice your stipulated fee in a voice that Lazarus might have used
when he rose from the dead is absurd Janoo who is really a woman of
masculine intellect saw this as quickly as I did I heard her say Asli
nahin Fareib scornfully under her breath and just as she said so
the light in the basin died out the head stopped talking and we heard
the room door creak on its hinges Then Janoo struck a match lit the
lamp and we saw that head basin and sealcutter were gone Suddhoo
was wringing his hands and explaining to any one who cared to listen
that if his chances of eternal salvation depended on it he could not
raise another two hundred rupees Azizun was nearly in hysterics in the
corner while Janoo sat down composedly on one of the beds to discuss
the probabilities of the whole thing being a bunao or makeup

I explained as much as I knew of the sealcutters way of jadoo but
her argument was much more simpleThe magic that is always demanding
gifts is no true magic said she My mother told me that the
only potent lovespells are those which are told you for love This
sealcutter man is a liar and a devil I dare not tell do anything or
get anything done because I am in debt to Bhagwan Dass the bunnia for
two gold rings and a heavy anklet I must get my food from his shop The
sealcutter is the friend of Bhagwan Dass and he would poison my food
A fools jadoo has been going on for ten days and has cost Suddhoo
many rupees each night The sealcutter used black hens and lemons and
mantras before He never showed us anything like this till tonight
Azizun is a fool and will be a purdah nashin soon Suddhoo has lost
his strength and his wits See now I had hoped to get from Suddhoo many
rupees while he lived and many more after his death and behold he
is spending everything on that offspring of a devil and a sheass the
sealcutter

Here I saidBut what induced Suddhoo to drag me into the business
Of course I can speak to the sealcutter and he shall refund The whole
thing is childs talkshameand senseless

Suddhoo IS an old child said Janoo He has lived on the roofs these
seventy years and is as senseless as a milchgoat He brought you here
to assure himself that he was not breaking any law of the Sirkar whose
salt he ate many years ago He worships the dust off the feet of the
sealcutter and that cowdevourer has forbidden him to go and see his
son What does Suddhoo know of your laws or the lightningpost I have
to watch his money going day by day to that lying beast below

Janoo stamped her foot on the floor and nearly cried with vexation
while Suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket in the corner and Azizun
was trying to guide the pipestem to his foolish old mouth


Now the case stands thus Unthinkingly I have laid myself open to the
charge of aiding and abetting the sealcutter in obtaining money under
false pretences which is forbidden by Section 420 of the Indian Penal
Code I am helpless in the matter for these reasons I cannot inform
the Police What witnesses would support my statements Janoo refuses
flatly Azizun is a veiled woman somewhere near Bareillylost in this
big India of ours I cannot again take the law into my own hands and
speak to the sealcutter for certain am I that not only would Suddhoo
disbelieve me but this step would end in the poisoning of Janoo who is
bound hand and foot by her debt to the bunnia Suddhoo is an old dotard
and whenever we meet mumbles my idiotic joke that the Sirkar rather
patronizes the Black Art than otherwise His son is well now but
Suddhoo is completely under the influence of the sealcutter by whose
advice he regulates the affairs of his life Janoo watches daily the
money that she hoped to wheedle out of Suddhoo taken by the sealcutter
and becomes daily more furious and sullen

She will never tell because she dare not but unless something
happens to prevent her I am afraid that the sealcutter will die of
cholerathe white arsenic kindabout the middle of May And thus I
shall have to be privy to a murder in the House of Suddhoo

Shakespeare says something about worms or it may be giants or beetles
turning if you tread on them too severely The safest plan is never to
tread on a wormnot even on the last new subaltern from Home with his
buttons hardly out of their tissue paper and the red of sappy English
beef in his cheeks This is the story of the worm that turned For
the sake of brevity we will call Henry Augustus Ramsay Faizanne The
Worm although he really was an exceedingly pretty boy without a hair
on his face and with a waist like a girls when he came out to the
Second Shikarris and was made unhappy in several ways The Shikarris
are a highcaste regiment and you must be able to do things wellplay
a banjo or ride more than a little or sing or actto get on with
them

The Worm did nothing except fall off his pony and knock chips out of
gateposts with his trap Even that became monotonous after a time He
objected to whist cut the cloth at billiards sang out of tune kept
very much to himself and wrote to his Mamma and sisters at Home Four
of these five things were vices which the Shikarris objected to and
set themselves to eradicate Every one knows how subalterns are by
brother subalterns softened and not permitted to be ferocious It is
good and wholesome and does no one any harm unless tempers are lost
and then there is trouble There was a man oncebut that is another
story

The Shikarris shikarred The Worm very much and he bore everything
without winking He was so good and so anxious to learn and flushed
so pink that his education was cut short and he was left to his own
devices by every one except the Senior Subaltern who continued to make
life a burden to The Worm The Senior Subaltern meant no harm but his
chaff was coarse and he didnt quite understand where to stop He had
been waiting too long for his company and that always sours a man Also
he was in love which made him worse

One day after he had borrowed The Worms trap for a lady who never
existed had used it himself all the afternoon had sent a note to The
Worm purporting to come from the lady and was telling the Mess all
about it The Worm rose in his place and said in his quiet ladylike
voice That was a very pretty sell but Ill lay you a months pay to
a months pay when you get your step that I work a sell on you that
youll remember for the rest of your days and the Regiment after you
when youre dead or broke The Worm wasnt angry in the least and the
rest of the Mess shouted Then the Senior Subaltern looked at The Worm
from the boots upwards and down again and said Done Baby The Worm
took the rest of the Mess to witness that the bet had been taken and
retired into a book with a sweet smile

Two months passed and the Senior Subaltern still educated The Worm
who began to move about a little more as the hot weather came on I have
said that the Senior Subaltern was in love The curious thing is that
a girl was in love with the Senior Subaltern Though the Colonel said
awful things and the Majors snorted and married Captains looked
unutterable wisdom and the juniors scoffed those two were engaged

The Senior Subaltern was so pleased with getting his Company and his
acceptance at the same time that he forgot to bother The Worm The girl
was a pretty girl and had money of her own She does not come into this
story at all

One night at the beginning of the hot weather all the Mess except The
Worm who had gone to his own room to write Home letters were sitting
on the platform outside the Mess House The Band had finished playing
but no one wanted to go in And the Captains wives were there also The
folly of a man in love is unlimited

The Senior Subaltern had been holding forth on the merits of the girl
he was engaged to and the ladies were purring approval while the men
yawned when there was a rustle of skirts in the dark and a tired
faint voice lifted itself

Wheres my husband

I do not wish in the least to reflect on the morality of the
Shikarris but it is on record that four men jumped up as if they had
been shot Three of them were married men Perhaps they were afraid that
their wives had come from Home unbeknownst The fourth said that he had
acted on the impulse of the moment He explained this afterwards

Then the voice criedOh Lionel Lionel was the Senior Subalterns
name A woman came into the little circle of light by the candles on
the pegtables stretching out her hands to the dark where the Senior
Subaltern was and sobbing We rose to our feet feeling that things
were going to happen and ready to believe the worst In this bad small
world of ours one knows so little of the life of the next manwhich
after all is entirely his own concernthat one is not surprised when
a crash comes Anything might turn up any day for any one Perhaps the
Senior Subaltern had been trapped in his youth Men are crippled that
way occasionally We didnt know we wanted to hear and the Captains
wives were as anxious as we If he HAD been trapped he was to be
excused for the woman from nowhere in the dusty shoes and gray
travelling dress was very lovely with black hair and great eyes full
of tears She was tall with a fine figure and her voice had a running
sob in it pitiful to hear As soon as the Senior Subaltern stood up she
threw her arms round his neck and called him my darling and said she
could not bear waiting alone in England and his letters were so short
and cold and she was his to the end of the world and would he forgive
her This did not sound quite like a ladys way of speaking It was too
demonstrative

Things seemed black indeed and the Captains wives peered under their
eyebrows at the Senior Subaltern and the Colonels face set like the
Day of Judgment framed in gray bristles and no one spoke for a while

Next the Colonel said very shortlyWell Sir and the woman sobbed
afresh The Senior Subaltern was half choked with the arms round his
neck but he gasped outIts a dd lie I never had a wife in my
life Dont swear said the Colonel Come into the Mess We must
sift this clear somehow and he sighed to himself for he believed in
his Shikarris did the Colonel

We trooped into the anteroom under the full lights and there we
saw how beautiful the woman was She stood up in the middle of us all
sometimes choking with crying then hard and proud and then holding
out her arms to the Senior Subaltern It was like the fourth act of a
tragedy She told us how the Senior Subaltern had married her when he
was Home on leave eighteen months before and she seemed to know all
that we knew and more too of his people and his past life He was
white and ashy gray trying now and again to break into the torrent
of her words and we noting how lovely she was and what a criminal he
looked esteemed him a beast of the worst kind We felt sorry for him
though

I shall never forget the indictment of the Senior Subaltern by his wife
Nor will he It was so sudden rushing out of the dark unannounced
into our dull lives The Captains wives stood back but their eyes were
alight and you could see that they had already convicted and sentenced
the Senior Subaltern The Colonel seemed five years older One Major was
shading his eyes with his hand and watching the woman from underneath
it Another was chewing his moustache and smiling quietly as if he
were witnessing a play Full in the open space in the centre by the
whisttables the Senior Subalterns terrier was hunting for fleas I
remember all this as clearly as though a photograph were in my hand
I remember the look of horror on the Senior Subalterns face It was
rather like seeing a man hanged but much more interesting Finally the
woman wound up by saying that the Senior Subaltern carried a double F
M in tattoo on his left shoulder We all knew that and to our innocent
minds it seemed to clinch the matter But one of the Bachelor Majors
said very politelyI presume that your marriage certificate would be
more to the purpose

That roused the woman She stood up and sneered at the Senior Subaltern
for a cur and abused the Major and the Colonel and all the rest
Then she wept and then she pulled a paper from her breast saying
imperiallyTake that And let my husbandmy lawfully wedded
husbandread it aloudif he dare

There was a hush and the men looked into each others eyes as the
Senior Subaltern came forward in a dazed and dizzy way and took the
paper We were wondering as we stared whether there was anything
against any one of us that might turn up later on The Senior
Subalterns throat was dry but as he ran his eye over the paper he
broke out into a hoarse cackle of relief and said to the womanYou
young blackguard

But the woman had fled through a door and on the paper was
writtenThis is to certify that I The Worm have paid in full my
debts to the Senior Subaltern and further that the Senior Subaltern
is my debtor by agreement on the 23d of February as by the Mess
attested to the extent of one months Captains pay in the lawful
currency of the India Empire

Then a deputation set off for The Worms quarters and found him betwixt
and between unlacing his stays with the hat wig serge dress etc
on the bed He came over as he was and the Shikarris shouted till the
Gunners Mess sent over to know if they might have a share of the fun I
think we were all except the Colonel and the Senior Subaltern a little
disappointed that the scandal had come to nothing But that is human
nature There could be no two words about The Worms acting It leaned
as near to a nasty tragedy as anything this side of a joke can When
most of the Subalterns sat upon him with sofacushions to find out
why he had not said that acting was his strong point he answered very
quietlyI dont think you ever asked me I used to act at Home with
my sisters But no acting with girls could account for The Worms
display that night Personally I think it was in bad taste

Besides being dangerous There is no sort of use in playing with fire
even for fun

The Shikarris made him President of the Regimental Dramatic Club and
when the Senior Subaltern paid up his debt which he did at once The
Worm sank the money in scenery and dresses He was a good Worm and
the Shikarris are proud of him The only drawback is that he has been
christened Mrs Senior Subaltern and as there are now two Mrs Senior
Subalterns in the Station this is sometimes confusing to strangers

Later on I will tell you of a case something like this but with all
the jest left out and nothing in it but real trouble




THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED

 While the snaffle holds or the longneck stings
 While the big beam tilts or the last bell rings
 While horses are horses to train and to race
 Then women and wine take a second place
 For mefor me
 While a short tenthree
 Has a field to squander or fence to face
 Song of the G R

There are more ways of running a horse to suit your book than pulling
his head off in the straight Some men forget this

Understand clearly that all racing is rottenas everything connected
with losing money must be Out here in addition to its inherent
rottenness it has the merit of being twothirds sham looking pretty
on paper only Every one knows every one else far too well for business
purposes How on earth can you rack and harry and post a man for his
losings when you are fond of his wife and live in the same Station
with him He says on the Monday following I cant settle just yet
You say All right old man and think your self lucky if you pull
off nine hundred out of a twothousand rupee debt Any way you look at
it Indian racing is immoral and expensively immoral Which is much
worse If a man wants your money he ought to ask for it or send round
a subscriptionlist instead of juggling about the country with an
Australian larrikin a brumby with as much breed as the boy a brace
of chumars in goldlaced caps three or four ekkaponies with hogged
manes and a switchtailed demirep of a mare called Arab because she
has a kink in her flag Racing leads to the shroff quicker than anything
else But if you have no conscience and no sentiments and good hands
and some knowledge of pace and ten years experience of horses and
several thousand rupees a month I believe that you can occasionally
contrive to pay your shoeingbills

Did you ever know Shacklesb w g 15138coarse loose mulelike
earsbarrel as long as a gateposttough as a telegraphwireand the
queerest brute that ever looked through a bridle He was of no brand
being one of an earnicked mob taken into the Bucephalus at 4l10s a
head to make up freight and sold raw and out of condition at Calcutta
for Rs 275 People who lost money on him called him a brumby but if
ever any horse had Harpoons shoulders and The Gins temper Shackles
was that horse Two miles was his own particular distance He trained
himself ran himself and rode himself and if his jockey insulted
him by giving him hints he shut up at once and bucked the boy off He
objected to dictation Two or three of his owners did not understand
this and lost money in consequence At last he was bought by a man who
discovered that if a race was to be won Shackles and Shackles only
would win it in his own way so long as his jockey sat still

This man had a ridingboy called Brunta lad from Perth West
Australiaand he taught Brunt with a trainers whip the hardest thing
a jock can learnto sit still to sit still and to keep on sitting
still When Brunt fairly grasped this truth Shackles devastated the
country No weight could stop him at his own distance and The fame of
Shackles spread from Ajmir in the South to Chedputter in the North
There was no horse like Shackles so long as he was allowed to do his
work in his own way But he was beaten in the end and the story of his
fall is enough to make angels weep

At the lower end of the Chedputter racecourse just before the turn into
the straight the track passes close to a couple of old brickmounds
enclosing a funnelshaped hollow The big end of the funnel is not six
feet from the railings on the offside The astounding peculiarity of
the course is that if you stand at one particular place about half a
mile away inside the course and speak at an ordinary pitch your voice
just hits the funnel of the brickmounds and makes a curious whining
echo there A man discovered this one morning by accident while out
training with a friend He marked the place to stand and speak from
with a couple of bricks and he kept his knowledge to himself EVERY
peculiarity of a course is worth remembering in a country where rats
play the mischief with the elephantlitter and Stewards build jumps to
suit their own stables

This man ran a very fairish countrybred a long racking high mare
with the temper of a fiend and the paces of an airy wandering serapha
drifty glidy stretch The mare was as a delicate tribute to Mrs
Reiver called The Lady Regula Baddunor for short Regula Baddun

Shackles jockey Brunt was a quiet wellbehaved boy but his nerves
had been shaken He began his career by riding jumpraces in Melbourne
where a few Stewards want lynching and was one of the jockeys who
came through the awful butcheryperhaps you will recollect itof the
Maribyrnong Plate The walls were colonial rampartslogs of jarrak
spiked into masonrywith wings as strong as Church buttresses Once
in his stride a horse had to jump or fall He couldnt run out In the
Maribyrnong Plate twelve horses were jammed at the second wall Red
Hat leading fell this side and threw out The Glen and the ruck
came up behind and the space between wing and wing was one struggling
screaming kicking shambles Four jockeys were taken out dead three
were very badly hurt and Brunt was among the three He told the story
of the Maribyrnong Plate sometimes and when he described how Whalley
on Red Hat said as the mare fell under himGod ha mercy Im done
for and how next instant Sithee There and White Otter had crushed
the life out of poor Whalley and the dust hid a small hell of men and
horses no one marvelled that Brunt had dropped jumpraces and Australia
together Regula Badduns owner knew that story by heart Brunt never
varied it in the telling He had no education

Shackles came to the Chedputter Autumn races one year and his owner
walked about insulting the sportsmen of Chedputter generally till
they went to the Honorary Secretary in a body and saidAppoint
Handicappers and arrange a race which shall break Shackles and humble
the pride of his owner The Districts rose against Shackles and sent
up of their best Ousel who was supposed to be able to do his mile in
153 Petard the studbred trained by a cavalry regiment who knew how
to train Gringalet the ewelamb of the 75th Bobolink the pride of
Peshawar and many others

They called that race The BrokenLink Handicap because it was to smash
Shackles and the Handicappers piled on the weights and the Fund gave
eight hundred rupees and the distance was round the course for all
horses Shackles owner saidYou can arrange the race with regard
to Shackles only So long as you dont bury him under weightcloths
I dont mind Regula Badduns owner saidI throw in my mare to fret
Ousel Six furlongs is Regulas distance and she will then lie down
and die So also will Ousel for his jockey doesnt understand a waiting
race Now this was a lie for Regula had been in work for two months
at Dehra and her chances were good always supposing that Shackles
broke a bloodvesselOR BRUNT MOVED ON HIM

The plunging in the lotteries was fine They filled eight thousand rupee
lotteries on the Broken Link Handicap and the account in the Pioneer
said that favoritism was divided In plain English the various
contingents were wild on their respective horses for the Handicappers
had done their work well The Honorary Secretary shouted himself hoarse
through the din and the smoke of the cheroots was like the smoke and
the rattling of the diceboxes like the rattle of smallarm fire

Ten horses startedvery leveland Regula Badduns owner cantered out
on his back to a place inside the circle of the course where two bricks
had been thrown He faced towards the brickmounds at the lower end of
the course and waited

he story of the running is in the Pioneer At the end of the first mile
Shackles crept out of the ruck well on the outside ready to get round
the turn lay hold of the bit and spin up the straight before the
others knew he had got away Brunt was sitting still perfectly happy
listening to the drum drum drum of the hoofs behind and knowing
that in about twenty strides Shackles would draw one deep breath and
go up the last halfmile like the Flying Dutchman As Shackles went
short to take the turn and came abreast of the brickmound Brunt heard
above the noise of the wind in his ears a whining wailing voice on the
offside sayingGod ha mercy Im done for In one stride Brunt
saw the whole seething smash of the Maribyrnong Plate before him
started in his saddle and gave a yell of terror The start brought the
heels into Shackles side and the scream hurt Shackles feelings He
couldnt stop dead but he put out his feet and slid along for fifty
yards and then very gravely and judicially bucked off Brunta
shaking terrorstricken lump while Regula Baddun made a neckandneck
race with Bobolink up the straight and won by a short headPetard
a bad third Shackles owner in the Stand tried to think that his
fieldglasses had gone wrong Regula Badduns owner waiting by the two
bricks gave one deep sigh of relief and cantered back to the stand He
had won in lotteries and bets about fifteen thousand

It was a brokenlink Handicap with a vengeance It broke nearly all the
men concerned and nearly broke the heart of Shackles owner

He went down to interview Brunt The boy lay livid and gasping with
fright where he had tumbled off The sin of losing the race never
seemed to strike him All he knew was that Whalley had called him
that the call was a warning and were he cut in two for it he would
never get up again His nerve had gone altogether and he only asked
his master to give him a good thrashing and let him go He was fit for
nothing he said He got his dismissal and crept up to the paddock
white as chalk with blue lips his knees giving way under him People
said nasty things in the paddock but Brunt never heeded He changed
into tweeds took his stick and went down the road still shaking with
fright and muttering over and over againGod ha mercy Im done
for To the best of my knowledge and belief he spoke the truth

So now you know how the BrokenLink Handicap was run and won Of course
you dont believe it You would credit anything about Russias designs
on India or the recommendations of the Currency Commission but a
little bit of sober fact is more than you can stand




BEYOND THE PALE

 Love heeds not caste nor sleep a broken bed I went in search of
 love and lost myself Hindu Proverb

A man should whatever happens keep to his own caste race and breed
Let the White go to the White and the Black to the Black

Then whatever trouble falls is in the ordinary course of
thingsneither sudden alien nor unexpected

This is the story of a man who wilfully stepped beyond the safe limits
of decent everyday society and paid for it heavily

He knew too much in the first instance and he saw too much in the
second He took too deep an interest in native life but he will never
do so again

Deep away in the heart of the City behind Jitha Megjis bustee lies
Amir Naths Gully which ends in a deadwall pierced by one grated
window At the head of the Gully is a big cowbyre and the walls on
either side of the Gully are without windows Neither Suchet Singh nor
Gaur Chand approved of their womenfolk looking into the world If
Durga Charan had been of their opinion he would have been a happier man
today and little Bisesa would have been able to knead her own bread
Her room looked out through the grated window into the narrow dark Gully
where the sun never came and where the buffaloes wallowed in the blue
slime She was a widow about fifteen years old and she prayed the
Gods day and night to send her a lover for she did not approve of
living alone

One day the manTrejago his name wascame into Amir Naths Gully on an
aimless wandering and after he had passed the buffaloes stumbled over
a big heap of cattle food

Then he saw that the Gully ended in a trap and heard a little laugh
from behind the grated window It was a pretty little laugh and
Trejago knowing that for all practical purposes the old Arabian
Nights are good guides went forward to the window and whispered that
verse of The Love Song of Har Dyal which begins

 Can a man stand upright in the face of the naked Sun
 or a Lover in the Presence of his Beloved
 If my feet fail me O Heart of my Heart am I to blame
 being blinded by the glimpse of your beauty

There came the faint tchinks of a womans bracelets from behind the
grating and a little voice went on with the song at the fifth verse

 Alas alas Can the Moon tell the Lotus of her love when the
 Gate of Heaven is shut and the clouds gather for the rains
 They have taken my Beloved and driven her with the packhorses
 to the North
 There are iron chains on the feet that were set on my heart
 Call to the bowman to make ready

The voice stopped suddenly and Trejago walked out of Amir Naths Gully
wondering who in the world could have capped The Love Song of Har Dyal
so neatly

Next morning as he was driving to the office an old woman threw a
packet into his dogcart In the packet was the half of a broken
glass bangle one flower of the blood red dhak a pinch of bhusa or
cattlefood and eleven cardamoms That packet was a letternot a
clumsy compromising letter but an innocent unintelligible lovers
epistle

Trejago knew far too much about these things as I have said No
Englishman should be able to translate objectletters But Trejago
spread all the trifles on the lid of his officebox and began to puzzle
them out

A broken glassbangle stands for a Hindu widow all India over because
when her husband dies a womans bracelets are broken on her wrists
Trejago saw the meaning of the little bit of the glass

The flower of the dhak means diversely desire come write or
danger according to the other things with it One cardamom means
jealousy but when any article is duplicated in an objectletter
it loses its symbolic meaning and stands merely for one of a number
indicating time or if incense curds or saffron be sent also
place The message ran thenA widow dhak flower and bhusaat eleven
oclock The pinch of bhusa enlightened Trejago He sawthis kind of
letter leaves much to instinctive knowledgethat the bhusa referred
to the big heap of cattlefood over which he had fallen in Amir Naths
Gully and that the message must come from the person behind the
grating she being a widow So the message ran thenA widow in
the Gully in which is the heap of bhusa desires you to come at eleven
oclock

Trejago threw all the rubbish into the fireplace and laughed He knew
that men in the East do not make love under windows at eleven in the
forenoon nor do women fix appointments a week in advance

So he went that very night at eleven into Amir Naths Gully clad in a
boorka which cloaks a man as well as a woman Directly the gongs in
the City made the hour the little voice behind the grating took up The
Love Song of Har Dyal at the verse where the Panthan girl calls upon
Har Dyal to return The song is really pretty in the Vernacular In
English you miss the wail of it It runs something like this

 Alone upon the housetops to the North
 I turn and watch the lightning in the sky
 The glamour of thy footsteps in the North
 Come back to me Beloved or I die

 Below my feet the still bazar is laid
 Far far below the weary camels lie
 The camels and the captives of thy raid
 Come back to me Beloved or I die

 My fathers wife is old and harsh with years
 And drudge of all my fathers house am I
 My bread is sorrow and my drink is tears
 Come back to me Beloved or I die

As the song stopped Trejago stepped up under the grating and
whisperedI am here

Bisesa was good to look upon

That night was the beginning of many strange things and of a double
life so wild that Trejago today sometimes wonders if it were not all a
dream Bisesa or her old handmaiden who had thrown the objectletter had
detached the heavy grating from the brickwork of the wall so that the
window slid inside leaving only a square of raw masonry into which an
active man might climb

In the daytime Trejago drove through his routine of officework or
put on his callingclothes and called on the ladies of the Station
wondering how long they would know him if they knew of poor little
Bisesa At night when all the City was still came the walk under the
evilsmelling boorka the patrol through Jitha Megjis bustee the quick
turn into Amir Naths Gully between the sleeping cattle and the dead
walls and then last of all Bisesa and the deep even breathing of
the old woman who slept outside the door of the bare little room that
Durga Charan allotted to his sisters daughter Who or what Durga Charan
was Trejago never inquired and why in the world he was not discovered
and knifed never occurred to him till his madness was over and Bisesa
But this comes later

Bisesa was an endless delight to Trejago She was as ignorant as a bird
and her distorted versions of the rumors from the outside world that had
reached her in her room amused Trejago almost as much as her lisping
attempts to pronounce his nameChristopher The first syllable was
always more than she could manage and she made funny little gestures
with her roseleaf hands as one throwing the name away and then
kneeling before Trejago asked him exactly as an Englishwoman would do
if he were sure he loved her Trejago swore that he loved her more than
any one else in the world Which was true

After a month of this folly the exigencies of his other life compelled
Trejago to be especially attentive to a lady of his acquaintance You
may take it for a fact that anything of this kind is not only noticed
and discussed by a mans own race but by some hundred and fifty natives
as well Trejago had to walk with this lady and talk to her at the
Bandstand and once or twice to drive with her never for an instant
dreaming that this would affect his dearer outoftheway life But the
news flew in the usual mysterious fashion from mouth to mouth till
Bisesas duenna heard of it and told Bisesa The child was so troubled
that she did the household work evilly and was beaten by Durga Charans
wife in consequence

A week later Bisesa taxed Trejago with the flirtation She understood
no gradations and spoke openly Trejago laughed and Bisesa stamped her
little feetlittle feet light as marigold flowers that could lie in
the palm of a mans one hand

Much that is written about Oriental passion and impulsiveness is
exaggerated and compiled at secondhand but a little of it is true and
when an Englishman finds that little it is quite as startling as any
passion in his own proper life Bisesa raged and stormed and finally
threatened to kill herself if Trejago did not at once drop the alien
Memsahib who had come between them Trejago tried to explain and
to show her that she did not understand these things from a Western
standpoint Bisesa drew herself up and said simply

I do not I know only thisit is not good that I should have made you
dearer than my own heart to me Sahib You are an Englishman
I am only a black girlshe was fairer than bargold in the Mintand
the widow of a black man

Then she sobbed and said But on my soul and my Mothers soul I love
you There shall no harm come to you whatever happens to me

Trejago argued with the child and tried to soothe her but she seemed
quite unreasonably disturbed Nothing would satisfy her save that all
relations between them should end He was to go away at once And he
went As he dropped out at the window she kissed his forehead twice
and he walked away wondering

A week and then three weeks passed without a sign from Bisesa

Trejago thinking that the rupture had lasted quite long enough went
down to Amir Naths Gully for the fifth time in the three weeks hoping
that his rap at the sill of the shifting grating would be answered He
was not disappointed

There was a young moon and one stream of light fell down into Amir
Naths Gully and struck the grating which was drawn away as he
knocked From the black dark Bisesa held out her arms into the
moonlight Both hands had been cut off at the wrists and the stumps
were nearly healed

Then as Bisesa bowed her head between her arms and sobbed some one in
the room grunted like a wild beast and something sharpknife sword or
spearthrust at Trejago in his boorka The stroke missed his body but
cut into one of the muscles of the groin and he limped slightly from
the wound for the rest of his days

The grating went into its place There was no sign whatever from inside
the housenothing but the moonlight strip on the high wall and the
blackness of Amir Naths Gully behind

The next thing Trejago remembers after raging and shouting like a
madman between those pitiless walls is that he found himself near the
river as the dawn was breaking threw away his boorka and went home
bareheaded

What the tragedy waswhether Bisesa had in a fit of causeless despair
told everything or the intrigue had been discovered and she tortured
to tell whether Durga Charan knew his name and what became of
BisesaTrejago does not know to this day Something horrible had
happened and the thought of what it must have been comes upon Trejago
in the night now and again and keeps him company till the morning
One special feature of the case is that he does not know where lies the
front of Durga Charans house It may open on to a courtyard common to
two or more houses or it may lie behind any one of the gates of Jitha
Megjis bustee Trejago cannot tell

He cannot get Bisesapoor little Bisesaback again He has lost her in
the City where each mans house is as guarded and as unknowable as the
grave and the grating that opens into Amir Naths Gully has been walled
up

But Trejago pays his calls regularly and is reckoned a very decent sort
of man

There is nothing peculiar about him except a slight stiffness caused
by a ridingstrain in the right leg




IN ERROR

 They burnt a corpse upon the sand
 The light shone out afar
 It guided home the plunging boats
 That beat from Zanzibar

 Spirit of Fire whereer Thy altars rise
 Thou art Light of Guidance to our eyes
 Salsette BoatSong

There is hope for a man who gets publicly and riotously drunk more
often that he ought to do but there is no hope for the man who drinks
secretly and alone in his own housethe man who is never seen to drink

This is a rule so there must be an exception to prove it

Moriartys case was that exception

He was a Civil Engineer and the Government very kindly put him quite
by himself in an outdistrict with nobody but natives to talk to and a
great deal of work to do He did his work well in the four years he
was utterly alone but he picked up the vice of secret and solitary
drinking and came up out of the wilderness more old and worn and
haggard than the deadalive life had any right to make him

You know the saying that a man who has been alone in the jungle for
more than a year is never quite sane all his life after People credited
Moriartys queerness of manner and moody ways to the solitude and said
it showed how Government spoilt the futures of its best men
Moriarty had built himself the plinth of a very god reputation in the
bridgedamgirder line But he knew every night of the week that
he was taking steps to undermine that reputation with L L L and
Christopher and little nips of liqueurs and filth of that kind He
had a sound constitution and a great brain or else he would have broken
down and died like a sick camel in the district as better men have done
before him

Government ordered him to Simla after he had come out of the desert
and he went up meaning to try for a post then vacant That season Mrs
Reiverperhaps you will remember herwas in the height of her power
and many men lay under her yoke Everything bad that could be said has
already been said about Mrs Reiver in another tale

Moriarty was heavilybuilt and handsome very quiet and nervously
anxious to please his neighbors when he wasnt sunk in a brown study
He started a good deal at sudden noises or if spoken to without warning
and when you watched him drinking his glass of water at dinner
you could see the hand shake a little But all this was put down to
nervousness and the quiet steady sipsipsip fill and sipsipsip
again that went on in his own room when he was by himself was never
known Which was miraculous seeing how everything in a mans private
life is public property out here

Moriarty was drawn not into Mrs Reivers set because they were not
his sort but into the power of Mrs Reiver and he fell down in front
of her and made a goddess of her This was due to his coming fresh out
of the jungle to a big town He could not scale things properly or see
who was what

Because Mrs Reiver was cold and hard he said she was stately and
dignified Because she had no brains and could not talk cleverly he
said she was reserved and shy Mrs Reiver shy Because she was unworthy
of honor or reverence from any one he reverenced her from a distance
and dowered her with all the virtues in the Bible and most of those in
Shakespeare

This big dark abstracted man who was so nervous when a pony cantered
behind him used to moon in the train of Mrs Reiver blushing with
pleasure when she threw a word or two his way His admiration was
strictly platonic even other women saw and admitted this He did not
move out in Simla so he heard nothing against his idol which was
satisfactory Mrs Reiver took no special notice of him beyond seeing
that he was added to her list of admirers and going for a walk with him
now and then just to show that he was her property claimable as such
Moriarty must have done most of the talking for Mrs Reiver couldnt
talk much to a man of his stamp and the little she said could not have
been profitable What Moriarty believed in as he had good reason to
was Mrs Reivers influence over him and in that belief set himself
seriously to try to do away with the vice that only he himself knew of

His experiences while he was fighting with it must have been peculiar
but he never described them Sometimes he would hold off from everything
except water for a week Then on a rainy night when no one had asked
him out to dinner and there was a big fire in his room and everything
comfortable he would sit down and make a big night of it by adding
little nip to little nip planning big schemes of reformation meanwhile
until he threw himself on his bed hopelessly drunk He suffered next
morning

One night the big crash came He was troubled in his own mind over his
attempts to make himself worthy of the friendship of Mrs Reiver The
past ten days had been very bad ones and the end of it all was that he
received the arrears of two and threequarter years of sipping in one
attack of delirium tremens of the subdued kind beginning with suicidal
depression going on to fits and starts and hysteria and ending with
downright raving As he sat in a chair in front of the fire or walked
up and down the room picking a handkerchief to pieces you heard what
poor Moriarty really thought of Mrs Reiver for he raved about her
and his own fall for the most part though he ravelled some P W D
accounts into the same skein of thought He talked and talked and
talked in a low dry whisper to himself and there was no stopping him
He seemed to know that there was something wrong and twice tried to
pull himself together and confer rationally with the Doctor but his
mind ran out of control at once and he fell back to a whisper and the
story of his troubles It is terrible to hear a big man babbling like a
child of all that a man usually locks up and puts away in the deep of
his heart Moriarty read out his very soul for the benefit of any one
who was in the room between tenthirty that night and twofortyfive
next morning

From what he said one gathered how immense an influence Mrs Reiver
held over him and how thoroughly he felt for his own lapse His
whisperings cannot of course be put down here but they were very
instructive as showing the errors of his estimates

When the trouble was over and his few acquaintances were pitying him
for the bad attack of junglefever that had so pulled him down Moriarty
swore a big oath to himself and went abroad again with Mrs Reiver till
the end of the season adoring her in a quiet and deferential way as an
angel from heaven Later on he took to ridingnot hacking but honest
ridingwhich was good proof that he was improving and you could slam
doors behind him without his jumping to his feet with a gasp That
again was hopeful

How he kept his oath and what it cost him in the beginning nobody
knows He certainly managed to compass the hardest thing that a man who
has drank heavily can do He took his peg and wine at dinner but he
never drank alone and never let what he drank have the least hold on
him

Once he told a bosomfriend the story of his great trouble and how the
influence of a pure honest woman and an angel as well had saved him
When the manstartled at anything good being laid to Mrs Reivers
doorlaughed it cost him Moriartys friendship

Moriarty who is married now to a woman ten thousand times better than
Mrs Reivera woman who believes that there is no man on earth as
good and clever as her husbandwill go down to his grave vowing and
protesting that Mrs Reiver saved him from ruin in both worlds

That she knew anything of Moriartys weakness nobody believed for
a moment That she would have cut him dead thrown him over and
acquainted all her friends with her discovery if she had known of it
nobody who knew her doubted for an instant

oriarty thought her something she never was and in that belief saved
himself Which was just as good as though she had been everything that
he had imagined

But the question is what claim will Mrs Reiver have to the credit of
Moriartys salvation when her day of reckoning comes




A BANK FRAUD

 He drank strong waters and his speech was coarse
 He purchased raiment and forebore to pay
 He struck a trusting junior with a horse
 And won Gymkhanas in a doubtful way

 Then twixt a vice and folly turned aside
 To do good deeds and straight to cloak them lied
 THE MESS ROOM

If Reggie Burke were in India now he would resent this tale being told
but as he is in HongKong and wont see it the telling is safe He was
the man who worked the big fraud on the Sind and Sialkote Bank He was
manager of an upcountry Branch and a sound practical man with a large
experience of native loan and insurance work He could combine the
frivolities of ordinary life with his work and yet do well Reggie
Burke rode anything that would let him get up danced as neatly as he
rode and was wanted for every sort of amusement in the Station

As he said himself and as many men found out rather to their surprise
there were two Burkes both very much at your service

Reggie Burke between four and ten ready for anything from a
hotweather gymkhana to a ridingpicnic and between ten and four Mr
Reginald Burke Manager of the Sind and Sialkote Branch Bank You might
play polo with him one afternoon and hear him express his opinions when
a man crossed and you might call on him next morning to raise a
twothousand rupee loan on a five hundred pound insurancepolicy eighty
pounds paid in premiums He would recognize you but you would have some
trouble in recognizing him

The Directors of the Bankit had its headquarters in Calcutta and its
General Managers word carried weight with the Governmentpicked their
men well They had tested Reggie up to a fairly severe breakingstrain
They trusted him just as much as Directors ever trust Managers You must
see for yourself whether their trust was misplaced

Reggies Branch was in a big Station and worked with the usual
staffone Manager one Accountant both English a Cashier and a horde
of native clerks besides the Police patrol at nights outside

The bulk of its work for it was in a thriving district was hoondi and
accommodation of all kinds A fool has no grip of this sort of business
and a clever man who does not go about among his clients and know more
than a little of their affairs is worse than a fool

Reggie was younglooking cleanshaved with a twinkle in his eye and
a head that nothing short of a gallon of the Gunners Madeira could make
any impression on

One day at a big dinner he announced casually that the Directors had
shifted on to him a Natural Curiosity from England in the Accountant
line He was perfectly correct Mr Silas Riley Accountant was a MOST
curious animala long gawky rawboned Yorkshireman full of the savage
selfconceit that blossoms only in the best county in England Arrogance
was a mild word for the mental attitude of Mr S Riley He had worked
himself up after seven years to a Cashiers position in a Huddersfield
Bank and all his experience lay among the factories of the North
Perhaps he would have done better on the Bombay side where they are
happy with onehalf per cent profits and money is cheap He was
useless for Upper India and a wheat Province where a man wants a large
head and a touch of imagination if he is to turn out a satisfactory
balancesheet

He was wonderfully narrowminded in business and being new to the
country had no notion that Indian banking is totally distinct from
Home work Like most clever selfmade men he had much simplicity in his
nature and somehow or other had construed the ordinarily polite terms
of his letter of engagement into a belief that the Directors had chosen
him on account of his special and brilliant talents and that they set
great store by him This notion grew and crystallized thus adding to
his natural Northcountry conceit

Further he was delicate suffered from some trouble in his chest and
was short in his temper

You will admit that Reggie had reason to call his new Accountant a
Natural Curiosity The two men failed to hit it off at all Riley
considered Reggie a wild featherheaded idiot given to Heaven only
knew what dissipation in low places called Messes and totally unfit
for the serious and solemn vocation of banking He could never get
over Reggies look of youth and youbedamned air and he couldnt
understand Reggies friendscleanbuilt careless men in the Armywho
rode over to big Sunday breakfasts at the Bank and told sultry stories
till Riley got up and left the room Riley was always showing Reggie
how the business ought to be conducted and Reggie had more than once to
remind him that seven years limited experience between Huddersfield and
Beverly did not qualify a man to steer a big upcountry business Then
Riley sulked and referred to himself as a pillar of the Bank and a
cherished friend of the Directors and Reggie tore his hair If a mans
English subordinates fail him in this country he comes to a hard time
indeed for native help has strict limitations In the winter Riley went
sick for weeks at a time with his lung complaint and this threw more
work on Reggie But he preferred it to the everlasting friction when
Riley was well

One of the Travelling Inspectors of the Bank discovered these collapses
and reported them to the Directors Now Riley had been foisted on the
Bank by an M P who wanted the support of Rileys father who again
was anxious to get his son out to a warmer climate because of those
lungs The M P had an interest in the Bank but one of the Directors
wanted to advance a nominee of his own and after Rileys father had
died he made the rest of the Board see that an Accountant who was sick
for half the year had better give place to a healthy man If Riley had
known the real story of his appointment he might have behaved better
but knowing nothing his stretches of sickness alternated with restless
persistent meddling irritation of Reggie and all the hundred ways in
which conceit in a subordinate situation can find play Reggie used to
call him striking and haircurling names behind his back as a relief to
his own feelings but he never abused him to his face because he said
Riley is such a frail beast that half of his loathsome conceit is due
to pains in the chest

Late one April Riley went very sick indeed The doctor punched him
and thumped him and told him he would be better before long Then the
doctor went to Reggie and saidDo you know how sick your Accountant
is No said ReggieThe worse the better confound him Hes a
clacking nuisance when hes well Ill let you take away the Bank Safe
if you can drug him silent for this hotweather

But the doctor did not laughMan Im not joking he said Ill give
him another three months in his bed and a week or so more to die in
On my honor and reputation thats all the grace he has in this world
Consumption has hold of him to the marrow

Reggies face changed at once into the face of Mr Reginald Burke and
he answeredWhat can I do

Nothing said the doctor For all practical purposes the man is dead
already Keep him quiet and cheerful and tell him hes going to recover
Thats all Ill look after him to the end of course

The doctor went away and Reggie sat down to open the evening mail

His first letter was one from the Directors intimating for his
information that Mr Riley was to resign under a months notice by the
terms of his agreement telling Reggie that their letter to Riley would
follow and advising Reggie of the coming of a new Accountant a man whom
Reggie knew and liked

Reggie lit a cheroot and before he had finished smoking he had
sketched the outline of a fraud He put awayburkedthe Directors
letter and went in to talk to Riley who was as ungracious as usual
and fretting himself over the way the bank would run during his illness
He never thought of the extra work on Reggies shoulders but solely of
the damage to his own prospects of advancement Then Reggie assured him
that everything would be well and that he Reggie would confer with
Riley daily on the management of the Bank Riley was a little soothed
but he hinted in as many words that he did not think much of Reggies
business capacity

Reggie was humble And he had letters in his desk from the Directors
that a Gilbarte or a Hardie might have been proud of

The days passed in the big darkened house and the Directors letter of
dismissal to Riley came and was put away by Reggie who every evening
brought the books to Rileys room and showed him what had been going
forward while Riley snarled Reggie did his best to make statements
pleasing to Riley but the Accountant was sure that the Bank was going
to rack and ruin without him In June as the lying in bed told on his
spirit he asked whether his absence had been noted by the Directors
and Reggie said that they had written most sympathetic letters hoping
that he would be able to resume his valuable services before long He
showed Riley the letters and Riley said that the Directors ought to
have written to him direct

A few days later Reggie opened Rileys mail in the halflight of the
room and gave him the sheetnot the envelopeof a letter to Riley
from the Directors Riley said he would thank Reggie not to interfere
with his private papers specially as Reggie knew he was too weak to
open his own letters Reggie apologized

Then Rileys mood changed and he lectured Reggie on his evil ways
his horses and his bad friends Of course lying here on my back Mr
Burke I cant keep you straight but when Im well I DO hope youll
pay some heed to my words Reggie who had dropped polo and dinners
and tennis and all to attend to Riley said that he was penitent and
settled Rileys head on the pillow and heard him fret and contradict in
hard dry hacking whispers without a sign of impatience This at the
end of a heavy days office work doing double duty in the latter half
of June

When the new Accountant came Reggie told him the facts of the case and
announced to Riley that he had a guest staying with him Riley said that
he might have had more consideration than to entertain his doubtful
friends at such a time Reggie made Carron the new Accountant sleep
at the Club in consequence Carrons arrival took some of the heavy work
off his shoulders and he had time to attend to Rileys exactionsto
explain soothe invent and settle and resettle the poor wretch in
bed and to forge complimentary letters from Calcutta At the end of the
first month Riley wished to send some money home to his mother Reggie
sent the draft At the end of the second month Rileys salary came in
just the same Reggie paid it out of his own pocket and with it wrote
Riley a beautiful letter from the Directors

Riley was very ill indeed but the flame of his life burnt unsteadily
Now and then he would be cheerful and confident about the future
sketching plans for going Home and seeing his mother

Reggie listened patiently when the office work was over and encouraged
him

At other times Riley insisted on Reggies reading the Bible and grim
Methody tracts to him Out of these tracts he pointed morals directed
at his Manager But he always found time to worry Reggie about the
working of the Bank and to show him where the weak points lay

This indoor sickroom life and constant strains wore Reggie down a
good deal and shook his nerves and lowered his billiardplay by forty
points But the business of the Bank and the business of the sickroom
had to go on though the glass was 116 degrees in the shade

At the end of the third month Riley was sinking fast and had begun
to realize that he was very sick But the conceit that made him worry
Reggie kept him from believing the worst He wants some sort of mental
stimulant if he is to drag on said the doctor

Keep him interested in life if you care about his living So Riley
contrary to all the laws of business and the finance received a
25percent rise of salary from the Directors The mental stimulant
succeeded beautifully Riley was happy and cheerful and as is often
the case in consumption healthiest in mind when the body was weakest
He lingered for a full month snarling and fretting about the Bank
talking of the future hearing the Bible read lecturing Reggie on sin
and wondering when he would be able to move abroad

But at the end of September one mercilessly hot evening he rose up in
his bed with a little gasp and said quickly to ReggieMr Burke I
am going to die I know it in myself My chest is all hollow inside and
theres nothing to breathe with To the best of my knowledge I have done
nowthe was returning to the talk of his boyhoodto lie heavy on my
conscience God be thanked I have been preserved from the grosser forms
of sin and I counsel YOU Mr Burke

Here his voice died down and Reggie stooped over him

Send my salary for September to my mother done great things with
the Bank if I had been spared mistaken policy no fault
of mine

Then he turned his face to the wall and died

Reggie drew the sheet over Its face and went out into the verandah
with his last mental stimulanta letter of condolence and sympathy
from the Directorsunused in his pocket

If Id been only ten minutes earlier thought Reggie I might have
heartened him up to pull through another day




TODS AMENDMENT

 The World hath set its heavy yoke
 Upon the old whitebearded folk
 Who strive to please the King

 Gods mercy is upon the young
 Gods wisdom in the baby tongue
 That fears not anything
 The Parable of Chajju Bhagat

Now Tods Mamma was a singularly charming woman and every one in Simla
knew Tods Most men had saved him from death on occasions

He was beyond his ayahs control altogether and perilled his life daily
to find out what would happen if you pulled a Mountain Battery mules
tail He was an utterly fearless young Pagan about six years old and
the only baby who ever broke the holy calm of the supreme Legislative
Council

It happened this way Tods pet kid got loose and fled up the hill off
the Boileaugunge Road Tods after it until it burst into the Viceregal
Lodge lawn then attached to Peterhoff The Council were sitting at
the time and the windows were open because it was warm The Red Lancer
in the porch told Tods to go away but Tods knew the Red Lancer and most
of the Members of Council personally

Moreover he had firm hold of the kids collar and was being dragged
all across the flowerbeds Give my salaam to the long Councillor
Sahib and ask him to help me take Moti back gasped Tods The Council
heard the noise through the open windows and after an interval was
seen the shocking spectacle of a Legal Member and a LieutenantGovernor
helping under the direct patronage of a CommanderinChief and a
Viceroy one small and very dirty boy in a sailors suit and a tangle
of brown hair to coerce a lively and rebellious kid They headed it off
down the path to the Mall and Tods went home in triumph and told his
Mamma that ALL the Councillor Sahibs had been helping him to catch Moti
Whereat his Mamma smacked Tods for interfering with the administration
of the Empire but Tods met the Legal Member the next day and told him
in confidence that if the Legal Member ever wanted to catch a goat he
Tods would give him all the help in his power Thank you Tods said
the Legal Member

Tods was the idol of some eighty jhampanis and half as many saises

He saluted them all as O Brother It never entered his head that
any living human being could disobey his orders and he was the
buffer between the servants and his Mammas wrath The working of that
household turned on Tods who was adored by every one from the dhoby
to the dogboy Even Futteh Khan the villainous loafer khit from
Mussoorie shirked risking Tods displeasure for fear his comates
should look down on him

So Tods had honor in the land from Boileaugunge to Chota Simla and
ruled justly according to his lights Of course he spoke Urdu but he
had also mastered many queer sidespeeches like the chotee bolee of the
women and held grave converse with shopkeepers and Hillcoolies alike
He was precocious for his age and his mixing with natives had taught
him some of the more bitter truths of life the meanness and the
sordidness of it He used over his bread and milk to deliver solemn
and serious aphorisms translated from the vernacular into the English
that made his Mamma jump and vow that Tods MUST go home next hot
weather

Just when Tods was in the bloom of his power the Supreme Legislature
were hacking out a Bill for the SubMontane Tracts a revision of the
then Act smaller than the Punjab Land Bill but affecting a few
hundred thousand people none the less The Legal Member had built
and bolstered and embroidered and amended that Bill till it looked
beautiful on paper Then the Council began to settle what they called
the minor details As if any Englishman legislating for natives knows
enough to know which are the minor and which are the major points from
the native point of view of any measure That Bill was a triumph of
safeguarding the interests of the tenant One clause provided that
land should not be leased on longer terms than five years at a stretch
because if the landlord had a tenant bound down for say twenty years
he would squeeze the very life out of him The notion was to keep up
a stream of independent cultivators in the SubMontane Tracts and
ethnologically and politically the notion was correct The only drawback
was that it was altogether wrong A natives life in India implies the
life of his son Wherefore you cannot legislate for one generation at
a time You must consider the next from the native point of view
Curiously enough the native now and then and in Northern India more
particularly hates being overprotected against himself There was
a Naga village once where they lived on dead AND buried Commissariat
mules But that is another story

For many reasons to be explained later the people concerned objected
to the Bill The Native Member in Council knew as much about Punjabis as
he knew about Charing Cross He had said in Calcutta that the Bill was
entirely in accord with the desires of that large and important class
the cultivators and so on and so on The Legal Members knowledge
of natives was limited to Englishspeaking Durbaris and his own red
chaprassis the SubMontane Tracts concerned no one in particular
the Deputy Commissioners were a good deal too driven to make
representations and the measure was one which dealt with small
landholders only Nevertheless the Legal Member prayed that it might be
correct for he was a nervously conscientious man He did not know that
no man can tell what natives think unless he mixes with them with the
varnish off And not always then But he did the best he knew And the
measure came up to the Supreme Council for the final touches while Tods
patrolled the Burra Simla Bazar in his morning rides and played with
the monkey belonging to Ditta Mull the bunnia and listened as a child
listens to all the stray talk about this new freak of the Lat Sahibs

One day there was a dinnerparty at the house of Tods Mamma and the
Legal Member came Tods was in bed but he kept awake till he heard the
bursts of laughter from the men over the coffee Then he paddled out in
his little red flannel dressinggown and his nightsuit and took refuge
by the side of his father knowing that he would not be sent back See
the miseries of having a family said Tods father giving Tods three
prunes some water in a glass that had been used for claret and telling
him to sit still Tods sucked the prunes slowly knowing that he would
have to go when they were finished and sipped the pink water like a man
of the world as he listened to the conversation Presently the Legal
Member talking shop to the Head of a Department mentioned his Bill
by its full nameThe SubMontane Tracts Ryotwari Revised Enactment
Tods caught the one native word and lifting up his small voice
saidOh I know ALL about that Has it been murramutted yet
Councillor Sahib

How much said the Legal Member

MurramuttedmendedPut theek you knowmade nice to please Ditta
Mull

The Legal Member left his place and moved up next to Tods

What do you know about Ryotwari little man he said

Im not a little man Im Tods and I know ALL about it Ditta Mull
and Choga Lall and Amir Nath andoh lakhs of my friends tell me
about it in the bazars when I talk to them

Oh they dodo they What do they say Tods

Tods tucked his feet under his red flannel dressinggown and saidI
must fink

The Legal Member waited patiently Then Tods with infinite compassion

You dont speak my talk do you Councillor Sahib

No I am sorry to say I do not said the Legal Member

Very well said Tods I must fink in English

He spent a minute putting his ideas in order and began very slowly
translating in his mind from the vernacular to English as many
AngloIndian children do You must remember that the Legal Member
helped him on by questions when he halted for Tods was not equal to the
sustained flight of oratory that follows

Ditta Mull saysThis thing is the talk of a child and was made up
by fools But I dont think you are a fool Councillor Sahib said
Tods hastily You caught my goat This is what Ditta Mull saysI am
not a fool and why should the Sirkar say I am a child I can see if
the land is good and if the landlord is good If I am a fool the sin is
upon my own head For five years I take my ground for which I have saved
money and a wife I take too and a little son is born Ditta Mull has
one daughter now but he SAYS he will have a son soon And he says At
the end of five years by this new bundobust I must go If I do not go
I must get fresh seals and takkusstamps on the papers perhaps in the
middle of the harvest and to go to the lawcourts once is wisdom but
to go twice is Jehannum That is QUITE true explained Tods gravely
All my friends say so And Ditta Mull saysAlways fresh takkus and
paying money to vakils and chaprassis and lawcourts every five years or
else the landlord makes me go Why do I want to go Am I fool If I am a
fool and do not know after forty years good land when I see it let
me die But if the new bundobust says for FIFTEEN years then it is
good and wise My little son is a man and I am burnt and he takes the
ground or another ground paying only once for the takkusstamps on the
papers and his little son is born and at the end of fifteen years is
a man too But what profit is there in five years and fresh papers
Nothing but dikh trouble dikh We are not young men who take these
lands but old onesnot jais but tradesmen with a little moneyand
for fifteen years we shall have peace Nor are we children that the
Sirkar should treat us so

Here Tods stopped short for the whole table were listening The Legal
Member said to Tods Is that all

All I can remember said Tods But you should see Ditta Mulls big
monkey Its just like a Councillor Sahib

Tods Go to bed said his father

Tods gathered up his dressinggown tail and departed

The Legal Member brought his hand down on the table with a crashBy
Jove said the Legal Member I believe the boy is right The short
tenure IS the weak point

He left early thinking over what Tods had said Now it was obviously
impossible for the Legal Member to play with a bunnias monkey by way
of getting understanding but he did better He made inquiries
always bearing in mind the fact that the real nativenot the hybrid
Universitytrained muleis as timid as a colt and little by little
he coaxed some of the men whom the measure concerned most intimately to
give in their views which squared very closely with Tods evidence

So the Bill was amended in that clause and the Legal Member was filled
with an uneasy suspicion that Native Members represent very little
except the Orders they carry on their bosoms But he put the thought
from him as illiberal He was a most Liberal Man

After a time the news spread through the bazars that Tods had got the
Bill recast in the tenure clause and if Tods Mamma had not interfered
Tods would have made himself sick on the baskets of fruit and pistachio
nuts and Cabuli grapes and almonds that crowded the verandah Till he
went Home Tods ranked some few degrees before the Viceroy in popular
estimation But for the little life of him Tods could not understand
why

In the Legal Members privatepaperbox still lies the rough draft of
the SubMontane Tracts Ryotwari Revised Enactment and opposite the
twentysecond clause pencilled in blue chalk and signed by the Legal
Member are the words Tods Amendment




IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH

 Stopped in the straight when the race was his own
 Look at him cutting itcur to the bone
 Ask ere the youngster be rated and chidden
 What did he carry and how was he ridden
 Maybe they used him too much at the start
 Maybe Fates weightcloths are breaking his heart
 Lifes Handicap

When I was telling you of the joke that The Worm played off on the
Senior Subaltern I promised a somewhat similar tale but with all the
jest left out This is that tale

Dicky Hatt was kidnapped in his early early youthneither by
landladys daughter housemaid barmaid nor cook but by a girl so
nearly of his own caste that only a woman could have said she was just
the least little bit in the world below it This happened a month
before he came out to India and five days after his oneandtwentieth
birthday The girl was nineteensix years older than Dicky in the
things of this world that is to sayand for the time twice as
foolish as he

Excepting always falling off a horse there is nothing more fatally
easy than marriage before the Registrar The ceremony costs less than
fifty shillings and is remarkably like walking into a pawnshop After
the declarations of residence have been put in four minutes will
cover the rest of the proceedingsfees attestation and all Then the
Registrar slides the blottingpad over the names and says grimly with
his pen between his teethNow youre man and wife and the couple
walk out into the street feeling as if something were horribly illegal
somewhere

But that ceremony holds and can drag a man to his undoing just
as thoroughly as the long as ye both shall live curse from the
altarrails with the bridesmaids giggling behind and The Voice that
breathed oer Eden lifting the roof off In this manner was Dicky Hatt
kidnapped and he considered it vastly fine for he had received an
appointment in India which carried a magnificent salary from the Home
point of view The marriage was to be kept secret for a year Then Mrs
Dicky Hatt was to come out and the rest of life was to be a glorious
golden mist That was how they sketched it under the Addison Road
Station lamps and after one short month came Gravesend and Dicky
steaming out to his new life and the girl crying in a thirtyshillings
a week bedandliving room in a back street off Montpelier Square near
the Knightsbridge Barracks

But the country that Dicky came to was a hard land where men of
twentyone were reckoned very small boys indeed and life was expensive
The salary that loomed so large six thousand miles away did not go far
Particularly when Dicky divided it by two and remitted more than the
fair half at 16 to Montpelier Square One hundred and thirtyfive
rupees out of three hundred and thirty is not much to live on but
it was absurd to suppose that Mrs Hatt could exist forever on the 20
pounds held back by Dicky from his outfit allowance Dicky saw this
and remitted at once always remembering that Rs 700 were to be paid
twelve months later for a firstclass passage out for a lady When you
add to these trifling details the natural instincts of a boy beginning a
new life in a new country and longing to go about and enjoy himself and
the necessity for grappling with strange workwhich properly speaking
should take up a boys undivided attentionyou will see that Dicky
started handicapped He saw it himself for a breath or two but he did
not guess the full beauty of his future

As the hot weather began the shackles settled on him and ate into his
flesh First would come lettersbig crossed seven sheet lettersfrom
his wife telling him how she longed to see him and what a Heaven upon
earth would be their property when they met

Then some boy of the chummery wherein Dicky lodged would pound on the
door of his bare little room and tell him to come out and look at a
ponythe very thing to suit him Dicky could not afford ponies He had
to explain this Dicky could not afford living in the chummery modest
as it was He had to explain this before he moved to a single room next
the office where he worked all day He kept house on a green oilcloth
tablecover one chair one charpoy one photograph one toothglass
very strong and thick a sevenrupee eightanna filter and messing by
contract at thirtyseven rupees a month Which last item was extortion
He had no punkah for a punkah costs fifteen rupees a month but he
slept on the roof of the office with all his wifes letters under his
pillow Now and again he was asked out to dinner where he got both a
punkah and an iced drink But this was seldom for people objected
to recognizing a boy who had evidently the instincts of a Scotch
tallowchandler and who lived in such a nasty fashion Dicky could not
subscribe to any amusement so he found no amusement except the pleasure
of turning over his Bankbook and reading what it said about loans
on approved security That cost nothing He remitted through a Bombay
Bank by the way and the Station knew nothing of his private affairs

Every month he sent Home all he could possibly spare for his wifeand
for another reason which was expected to explain itself shortly and
would require more money

About this time Dicky was overtaken with the nervous haunting fear
that besets married men when they are out of sorts He had no pension to
look to What if he should die suddenly and leave his wife unprovided
for The thought used to lay hold of him in the still hot nights on the
roof till the shaking of his heart made him think that he was going to
die then and there of heartdisease

Now this is a frame of mind which no boy has a right to know It is
a strong mans trouble but coming when it did it nearly drove poor
punkahless perspiring Dicky Hatt mad He could tell no one about it

A certain amount of screw is as necessary for a man as for a
billiardball It makes them both do wonderful things Dicky needed
money badly and he worked for it like a horse But naturally the men
who owned him knew that a boy can live very comfortably on a certain
incomepay in India is a matter of age not merit you see and if
their particular boy wished to work like two boys Business forbid that
they should stop him But Business forbid that they should give him an
increase of pay at his present ridiculously immature age So Dicky won
certain rises of salaryample for a boynot enough for a wife and
childcertainly too little for the sevenhundredrupee passage that he
and Mrs Hatt had discussed so lightly once upon a time And with this
he was forced to be content

Somehow all his money seemed to fade away in Home drafts and the
crushing Exchange and the tone of the Home letters changed and grew
querulous Why wouldnt Dicky have his wife and the baby out Surely he
had a salarya fine salaryand it was too bad of him to enjoy himself
in India But would hecould hemake the next draft a little more
elastic Here followed a list of babys kit as long as a Parsees
bill Then Dicky whose heart yearned to his wife and the little son
he had never seenwhich again is a feeling no boy is entitled
toenlarged the draft and wrote queer halfboy halfman letters
saying that life was not so enjoyable after all and would the little
wife wait yet a little longer But the little wife however much she
approved of money objected to waiting and there was a strange hard
sort of ring in her letters that Dicky didnt understand How could he
poor boy

Later on stilljust as Dicky had been toldapropos of another
youngster who had made a fool of himself as the saying isthat
matrimony would not only ruin his further chances of advancement but
would lose him his present appointmentcame the news that the baby his
own little little son had died and behind this forty lines of
an angry womans scrawl saying that death might have been averted if
certain things all costing money had been done or if the mother and
the baby had been with Dicky The letter struck at Dickys naked heart
but not being officially entitled to a baby he could show no sign of
trouble

How Dicky won through the next four months and what hope he kept
alight to force him into his work no one dare say He pounded on the
sevenhundredrupee passage as far away as ever and his style of living
unchanged except when he launched into a new filter

There was the strain of his officework and the strain of his
remittances and the knowledge of his boys death which touched the boy
more perhaps than it would have touched a man and beyond all the
enduring strain of his daily life Grayheaded seniors who approved
of his thrift and his fashion of denying himself everything pleasant
reminded him of the old saw that says

 If a youth would be distinguished in his art art art
 He must keep the girls away from his heart heart heart

And Dicky who fancied he had been through every trouble that a man is
permitted to know had to laugh and agree with the last line of his
balanced Bankbook jingling in his head day and night

But he had one more sorrow to digest before the end There arrived a
letter from the little wifethe natural sequence of the others if
Dicky had only known itand the burden of that letter was gone with
a handsomer man than you It was a rather curious production without
stops something like thisShe was not going to wait forever and the
baby was dead and Dicky was only a boy and he would never set eyes on
her again and why hadnt he waved his handkerchief to her when he left
Gravesend and God was her judge she was a wicked woman but Dicky was
worse enjoying himself in India and this other man loved the ground she
trod on and would Dicky ever forgive her for she would never forgive
Dicky and there was no address to write to

Instead of thanking his lucky stars that he was free Dicky discovered
exactly how an injured husband feelsagain not at all the knowledge
to which a boy is entitledfor his mind went back to his wife as he
remembered her in the thirtyshilling suite in Montpelier Square when
the dawn of his last morning in England was breaking and she was crying
in the bed Whereat he rolled about on his bed and bit his fingers He
never stopped to think whether if he had met Mrs Hatt after those
two years he would have discovered that he and she had grown quite
different and new persons This theoretically he ought to have done
He spent the night after the English Mail came in rather severe pain

Next morning Dicky Hatt felt disinclined to work He argued that he had
missed the pleasure of youth He was tired and he had tasted all the
sorrow in life before threeandtwenty His Honor was gonethat was the
man and now he too would go to the Devilthat was the boy in him So
he put his head down on the green oilcloth tablecover and wept before
resigning his post and all it offered

But the reward of his services came He was given three days to
reconsider himself and the Head of the establishment after some
telegraphings said that it was a most unusual step but in view of the
ability that Mr Hatt had displayed at such and such a time at such and
such junctures he was in a position to offer him an infinitely superior
postfirst on probation and later in the natural course of things
on confirmation And how much does the post carry said Dicky Six
hundred and fifty rupees said the Head slowly expecting to see the
young man sink with gratitude and joy

And it came then The seven hundred rupee passage and enough to have
saved the wife and the little son and to have allowed of assured and
open marriage came then Dicky burst into a roar of laughterlaughter
he could not checknasty jangling merriment that seemed as if it
would go on forever When he had recovered himself he said quite
seriouslyIm tired of work Im an old man now Its about time I
retired And I will

The boys mad said the Head

I think he was right but Dicky Hatt never reappeared to settle the
question




PIG

 Go stalk the red deer oer the heather
 Ride follow the fox if you can
 But for pleasure and profit together
 Allow me the hunting of Man
 The chase of the Human the search for the Soul
 To its ruinthe hunting of Man
 The Old Shikarri

I believe the difference began in the matter of a horse with a twist in
his temper whom Pinecoffin sold to Nafferton and by whom Nafferton was
nearly slain There may have been other causes of offence the horse was
the official stalkinghorse Nafferton was very angry but Pinecoffin
laughed and said that he had never guaranteed the beasts manners
Nafferton laughed too though he vowed that he would write off his fall
against Pinecoffin if he waited five years Now a Dalesman from beyond
Skipton will forgive an injury when the Strid lets a man live but a
South Devon man is as soft as a Dartmoor bog You can see from their
names that Nafferton had the raceadvantage of Pinecoffin He was a
peculiar man and his notions of humor were cruel He taught me a new
and fascinating form of shikar He hounded Pinecoffin from Mithankot
to Jagadri and from Gurgaon to Abbottabad up and across the Punjab
a large province and in places remarkably dry He said that he had no
intention of allowing Assistant Commissioners to sell him pups in the
shape of ramping screaming countrybreds without making their lives a
burden to them

Most Assistant Commissioners develop a bent for some special work after
their first hot weather in the country The boys with digestions hope to
write their names large on the Frontier and struggle for dreary places
like Bannu and Kohat The bilious ones climb into the Secretariat Which
is very bad for the liver

Others are bitten with a mania for District work Ghuznivide coins or
Persian poetry while some who come of farmers stock find that the
smell of the Earth after the Rains gets into their blood and calls them
to develop the resources of the Province These men are enthusiasts
Pinecoffin belonged to their class He knew a great many facts bearing
on the cost of bullocks and temporary wells and opiumscrapers and
what happens if you burn too much rubbish on a field in the hope of
enriching usedup soil All the Pinecoffins come of a landholding
breed and so the land only took back her own again Unfortunatelymost
unfortunately for Pinecoffinhe was a Civilian as well as a
farmer Nafferton watched him and thought about the horse Nafferton
saidSee me chase that boy till he drops I saidYou cant get
your knife into an Assistant Commissioner Nafferton told me that I did
not understand the administration of the Province

Our Government is rather peculiar It gushes on the agricultural and
general information side and will supply a moderately respectable man
with all sorts of economic statistics if he speaks to it prettily
For instance you are interested in goldwashing in the sands of the
Sutlej You pull the string and find that it wakes up half a dozen
Departments and finally communicates say with a friend of yours
in the Telegraph who once wrote some notes on the customs of the
goldwashers when he was on constructionwork in their part of the
Empire He may or may not be pleased at being ordered to write out
everything he knows for your benefit This depends on his temperament
The bigger man you are the more information and the greater trouble can
you raise

Nafferton was not a big man but he had the reputation of being very
earnest An earnest man can do much with a Government There was
an earnest man who once nearly wrecked but all India knows THAT
story I am not sure what real earnestness is A very fair imitation
can be manufactured by neglecting to dress decently by mooning about in
a dreamy misty sort of way by taking officework home after staying
in office till seven and by receiving crowds of native gentlemen on
Sundays That is one sort of earnestness

Nafferton cast about for a peg whereon to hang his earnestness and for
a string that would communicate with Pinecoffin He found both

They were Pig Nafferton became an earnest inquirer after Pig He
informed the Government that he had a scheme whereby a very large
percentage of the British Army in India could be fed at a very large
saving on Pig Then he hinted that Pinecoffin might supply him with the
varied information necessary to the proper inception of the scheme
So the Government wrote on the back of the letterInstruct Mr
Pinecoffin to furnish Mr Nafferton with any information in his power
Government is very prone to writing things on the backs of letters
which later lead to trouble and confusion

Nafferton had not the faintest interest in Pig but he knew that
Pinecoffin would flounce into the trap Pinecoffin was delighted at
being consulted about Pig The Indian Pig is not exactly an important
factor in agricultural life but Nafferton explained to Pinecoffin that
there was room for improvement and corresponded direct with that young
man

You may think that there is not much to be evolved from Pig It all
depends how you set to work Pinecoffin being a Civilian and wishing
to do things thoroughly began with an essay on the Primitive Pig the
Mythology of the Pig and the Dravidian Pig

Nafferton filed that informationtwentyseven foolscap sheetsand
wanted to know about the distribution of the Pig in the Punjab and
how it stood the Plains in the hot weather From this point onwards
remember that I am giving you only the barest outlines of the
affairthe guyropes as it were of the web that Nafferton spun round
Pinecoffin

Pinecoffin made a colored Pigpopulation map and collected observations
on the comparative longevity of the Pig a in the submontane tracts of
the Himalayas and b in the Rechna Doab

Nafferton filed that and asked what sort of people looked after Pig
This started an ethnological excursus on swineherds and drew from
Pinecoffin long tables showing the proportion per thousand of the caste
in the Derajat Nafferton filed that bundle and explained that the
figures which he wanted referred to the CisSutlej states where he
understood that Pigs were very fine and large and where he proposed
to start a Piggery By this time Government had quite forgotten their
instructions to Mr Pinecoffin

They were like the gentlemen in Keats poem who turned welloiled
wheels to skin other people But Pinecoffin was just entering into the
spirit of the Pighunt as Nafferton well knew he would do He had a
fair amount of work of his own to clear away but he sat up of nights
reducing Pig to five places of decimals for the honor of his Service He
was not going to appear ignorant of so easy a subject as Pig

Then Government sent him on special duty to Kohat to inquire into
the bigsevenfoot ironshod spades of that District People had been
killing each other with those peaceful tools and Government wished
to know whether a modified form of agricultural implement could
not tentatively and as a temporary measure be introduced among the
agricultural population without needlessly or unduly exasperating the
existing religious sentiments of the peasantry

Between those spades and Naffertons Pig Pinecoffin was rather heavily
burdened

 Nafferton now began to take up a The foodsupply of the indigenous Pig
with a view to the improvement of its capacities as a fleshformer
b The acclimatization of the exotic Pig maintaining its distinctive
peculiarities Pinecoffin replied exhaustively that the exotic Pig
would become merged in the indigenous type and quoted horsebreeding
statistics to prove this

The sideissue was debated at great length on Pinecoffins side till
Nafferton owned that he had been in the wrong and moved the previous
question When Pinecoffin had quite written himself out about
fleshformers and fibrins and glucose and the nitrogenous constituents
of maize and lucerne Nafferton raised the question of expense By this
time Pinecoffin who had been transferred from Kohat had developed a
Pig theory of his own which he stated in thirtythree folio pagesall
carefully filed by Nafferton Who asked for more

These things took ten months and Pinecoffins interest in the potential
Piggery seemed to die down after he had stated his own views But
Nafferton bombarded him with letters on the Imperial aspect of
the scheme as tending to officialize the sale of pork and thereby
calculated to give offence to the Mahomedan population of Upper India
He guessed that Pinecoffin would want some broad freehand work after
his niggling stippling decimal details

Pinecoffin handled the latest development of the case in masterly
style and proved that no popular ebullition of excitement was to
be apprehended Nafferton said that there was nothing like Civilian
insight in matters of this kind and lured him up a byepaththe
possible profits to accrue to the Government from the sale of
hogbristles There is an extensive literature of hogbristles and the
shoe brush and colormans trades recognize more varieties of bristles
than you would think possible After Pinecoffin had wondered a little
at Naffertons rage for information he sent back a monograph fiftyone
pages on Products of the Pig This led him under Naffertons tender
handling straight to the Cawnpore factories the trade in hogskin
for saddlesand thence to the tanners Pinecoffin wrote that
pomegranateseed was the best cure for hogskin and suggestedfor the
past fourteen months had wearied himthat Nafferton should raise his
pigs before he tanned them

Nafferton went back to the second section of his fifth question

How could the exotic Pig be brought to give as much pork as it did in
the West and yet assume the essentially hirsute characteristics of its
oriental congener Pinecoffin felt dazed for he had forgotten what
he had written sixteen months before and fancied that he was about
to reopen the entire question He was too far involved in the hideous
tangle to retreat and in a weak moment he wroteConsult my first
letter Which related to the Dravidian Pig As a matter of fact
Pinecoffin had still to reach the acclimatization stage having gone off
on a sideissue on the merging of types

THEN Nafferton really unmasked his batteries He complained to the
Government in stately language of the paucity of help accorded to me
in my earnest attempts to start a potentially remunerative industry and
the flippancy with which my requests for information are treated by a
gentleman whose pseudoscholarly attainments should at lest have taught
him the primary differences between the Dravidian and the Berkshire
variety of the genus Sus If I am to understand that the letter to which
he refers me contains his serious views on the acclimatization of a
valuable though possibly uncleanly animal I am reluctantly compelled
to believe etc etc

There was a new man at the head of the Department of Castigation

The wretched Pinecoffin was told that the Service was made for the
Country and not the Country for the Service and that he had better
begin to supply information about Pigs

Pinecoffin answered insanely that he had written everything that could
be written about Pig and that some furlough was due to him

Nafferton got a copy of that letter and sent it with the essay on the
Dravidian Pig to a downcountry paper which printed both in full The
essay was rather highflown but if the Editor had seen the stacks of
paper in Pinecoffins handwriting on Naffertons table he would not
have been so sarcastic about the nebulous discursiveness and blatant
selfsufficiency of the modern Competitionwallah and his utter
inability to grasp the practical issues of a practical question Many
friends cut out these remarks and sent them to Pinecoffin

I have already stated that Pinecoffin came of a soft stock This last
stroke frightened and shook him He could not understand it but he felt
he had been somehow shamelessly betrayed by Nafferton

He realized that he had wrapped himself up in the Pigskin without need
and that he could not well set himself right with his Government All
his acquaintances asked after his nebulous discursiveness or his
blatant selfsufficiency and this made him miserable

He took a train and went to Nafferton whom he had not seen since
the Pig business began He also took the cutting from the paper and
blustered feebly and called Nafferton names and then died down to a
watery weak protest of the Isayitstoobadyouknow order

Nafferton was very sympathetic

Im afraid Ive given you a good deal of trouble havent I said he

Trouble whimpered Pinecoffin I dont mind the trouble so much
though that was bad enough but what I resent is this showing up in
print It will stick to me like a burr all through my service And I DID
do my best for your interminable swine Its too bad of you on my soul
it is

I dont know said Nafferton have you ever been stuck with a horse
It isnt the money I mind though that is bad enough but what I resent
is the chaff that follows especially from the boy who stuck me But I
think well cry quite now

Pinecoffin found nothing to say save bad words and Nafferton smiled
ever so sweetly and asked him to dinner




THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS

 It was not in the open fight
 We threw away the sword
 But in the lonely watching
 In the darkness by the ford

 The waters lapped the nightwind blew
 Fullarmed the Fear was born and grew
 And we were flying ere we knew
 From panic in the night
 Beoni Bar

Some people hold that an English Cavalry regiment cannot run This is
a mistake I have seen four hundred and thirtyseven sabres flying over
the face of the country in abject terrorhave seen the best Regiment
that ever drew bridle wiped off the Army List for the space of two
hours If you repeat this tale to the White Hussars they will in all
probability treat you severely They are not proud of the incident

You may know the White Hussars by their side which is greater than
that of all the Cavalry Regiments on the roster If this is not a
sufficient mark you may know them by their old brandy It has been
sixty years in the Mess and is worth going far to taste

Ask for the McGaire old brandy and see that you get it If the Mess
Sergeant thinks that you are uneducated and that the genuine article
will be lost on you he will treat you accordingly He is a good man
But when you are at Mess you must never talk to your hosts about
forced marches or longdistance rides The Mess are very sensitive and
if they think that you are laughing at them will tell you so

As the White Hussars say it was all the Colonels fault He was a new
man and he ought never to have taken the Command He said that the
Regiment was not smart enough This to the White Hussars who knew they
could walk round any Horse and through any Guns and over any Foot on
the face of the earth That insult was the first cause of offence

Then the Colonel cast the DrumHorsethe DrumHorse of the White
Hussars Perhaps you do not see what an unspeakable crime he had
committed I will try to make it clear The soul of the Regiment lives
in the DrumHorse who carries the silver kettledrums He is nearly
always a big piebald Waler That is a point of honor and a Regiment
will spend anything you please on a piebald He is beyond the ordinary
laws of casting His work is very light and he only manoeuvres at a
footpace Wherefore so long as he can step out and look handsome
his wellbeing is assured He knows more about the Regiment than the
Adjutant and could not make a mistake if he tried

The DrumHorse of the White Hussars was only eighteen years old and
perfectly equal to his duties He had at least six years more work in
him and carried himself with all the pomp and dignity of a DrumMajor
of the Guards The Regiment had paid Rs 1200 for him

But the Colonel said that he must go and he was cast in due form and
replaced by a washy bay beast as ugly as a mule with a eweneck
rattail and cowhocks The Drummer detested that animal and the best
of the Bandhorses put back their ears and showed the whites of their
eyes at the very sight of him They knew him for an upstart and no
gentleman I fancy that the Colonels ideas of smartness extended to
the Band and that he wanted to make it take part in the regular parade
movements A Cavalry Band is a sacred thing It only turns out for
Commanding Officers parades and the Band Master is one degree more
important than the Colonel He is a High Priest and the Keel Row is
his holy song The Keel Row is the Cavalry Trot and the man who has
never heard that tune rising high and shrill above the rattle of the
Regiment going past the salutingbase has something yet to hear and
understand

When the Colonel cast the Drumhorse of the White Hussars there was
nearly a mutiny

The officers were angry the Regiment were furious and the Bandsman
sworelike troopers The DrumHorse was going to be put up to
auctionpublic auctionto be bought perhaps by a Parsee and put into
a cart It was worse than exposing the inner life of the Regiment to the
whole world or selling the Mess Plate to a Jewa black Jew

The Colonel was a mean man and a bully He knew what the Regiment
thought about his action and when the troopers offered to buy the
DrumHorse he said that their offer was mutinous and forbidden by the
Regulations

But one of the SubalternsHoganYale an Irishmanbought the
DrumHorse for Rs 160 at the sale and the Colonel was wroth Yale
professed repentancehe was unnaturally submissiveand said that
as he had only made the purchase to save the horse from possible
illtreatment and starvation he would now shoot him and end the
business This appeared to soothe the Colonel for he wanted the
DrumHorse disposed of He felt that he had made a mistake and could
not of course acknowledge it Meantime the presence of the DrumHorse
was an annoyance to him

Yale took to himself a glass of the old brandy three cheroots and his
friend Martyn and they all left the Mess together Yale and Martyn
conferred for two hours in Yales quarters but only the bullterrier
who keeps watch over Yales boottrees knows what they said A horse
hooded and sheeted to his ears left Yales stables and was taken very
unwillingly into the Civil Lines Yales groom went with him Two men
broke into the Regimental Theatre and took several paintpots and some
large scenery brushes Then night fell over the Cantonments and there
was a noise as of a horse kicking his loosebox to pieces in Yales
stables Yale had a big old white Waler traphorse

The next day was a Thursday and the men hearing that Yale was going
to shoot the DrumHorse in the evening determined to give the beast a
regular regimental funerala finer one than they would have given the
Colonel had he died just then They got a bullockcart and some sacking
and mounds and mounds of roses and the body under sacking was carried
out to the place where the anthrax cases were cremated twothirds of
the Regiment followed There was no Band but they all sang The Place
where the old Horse died as something respectful and appropriate to the
occasion When the corpse was dumped into the grave and the men began
throwing down armfuls of roses to cover it the FarrierSergeant ripped
out an oath and said aloudWhy it aint the DrumHorse any more than
its me The TroopSergeantMajors asked him whether he had left
his head in the Canteen The FarrierSergeant said that he knew the
DrumHorses feet as well as he knew his own but he was silenced
when he saw the regimental number burnt in on the poor stiff upturned
nearfore

Thus was the DrumHorse of the White Hussars buried the
FarrierSergeant grumbling The sacking that covered the corpse was
smeared in places with black paint and the FarrierSergeant drew
attention to this fact But the TroopSergeantMajor of E Troop kicked
him severely on the shin and told him that he was undoubtedly drunk

On the Monday following the burial the Colonel sought revenge on the
White Hussars Unfortunately being at that time temporarily in Command
of the Station he ordered a Brigade fieldday He said that he wished
to make the regiment sweat for their damned insolence and he carried
out his notion thoroughly That Monday was one of the hardest days in
the memory of the White Hussars

They were thrown against a skeletonenemy and pushed forward and
withdrawn and dismounted and scientifically handled in every
possible fashion over dusty country till they sweated profusely

Their only amusement came late in the day when they fell upon the
battery of Horse Artillery and chased it for two miles This was a
personal question and most of the troopers had money on the event the
Gunners saying openly that they had the legs of the White Hussars They
were wrong A marchpast concluded the campaign and when the Regiment
got back to their Lines the men were coated with dirt from spur to
chinstrap

The White Hussars have one great and peculiar privilege They won it at
Fontenoy I think

Many Regiments possess special rights such as wearing collars with
undress uniform or a bow of ribbon between the shoulders or red and
white roses in their helmets on certain days of the year Some
rights are connected with regimental saints and some with regimental
successes All are valued highly but none so highly as the right of
the White Hussars to have the Band playing when their horses are being
watered in the Lines Only one tune is played and that tune never
varies I dont know its real name but the White Hussars call
itTake me to London again It sounds very pretty The Regiment
would sooner be struck off the roster than forego their distinction

After the dismiss was sounded the officers rode off home to prepare
for stables and the men filed into the lines riding easy

That is to say they opened their tight buttons shifted their helmets
and began to joke or to swear as the humor took them the more careful
slipping off and easing girths and curbs A good trooper values his
mount exactly as much as he values himself and believes or should
believe that the two together are irresistible where women or men
girls or guns are concerned

Then the OrderlyOfficer gave the orderWater horses and the
Regiment loafed off to the squadrontroughs which were in rear of
the stables and between these and the barracks There were four huge
troughs one for each squadron arranged en echelon so that the whole
Regiment could water in ten minutes if it liked But it lingered for
seventeen as a rule while the Band played

The band struck up as the squadrons filed off the troughs and the men
slipped their feet out of the stirrups and chaffed each other

The sun was just setting in a big hot bed of red cloud and the road to
the Civil Lines seemed to run straight into the suns eye

There was a little dot on the road It grew and grew till it showed as
a horse with a sort of gridiron thing on his back The red cloud glared
through the bars of the gridiron Some of the troopers shaded their eyes
with their hands and saidWhat the mischief as that there orse got
on im

In another minute they heard a neigh that every soulhorse and manin
the Regiment knew and saw heading straight towards the Band the dead
DrumHorse of the White Hussars

On his withers banged and bumped the kettledrums draped in crape and
on his back very stiff and soldierly sat a bareheaded skeleton

The band stopped playing and for a moment there was a hush

Then some one in E troopmen said it was the
TroopSergeantMajorswung his horse round and yelled No one can
account exactly for what happened afterwards but it seems that at
least one man in each troop set an example of panic and the rest
followed like sheep The horses that had barely put their muzzles into
the troughs reared and capered but as soon as the Band broke which
it did when the ghost of the DrumHorse was about a furlong distant all
hooves followed suit and the clatter of the stampedequite different
from the orderly throb and roar of a movement on parade or the rough
horseplay of watering in campmade them only more terrified They felt
that the men on their backs were afraid of something When horses once
know THAT all is over except the butchery

Troop after troop turned from the troughs and rananywhere and
everywherelike spilt quicksilver It was a most extraordinary
spectacle for men and horses were in all stages of easiness and the
carbinebuckets flopping against their sides urged the horses on Men
were shouting and cursing and trying to pull clear of the Band which
was being chased by the DrumHorse whose rider had fallen forward and
seemed to be spurring for a wager

The Colonel had gone over to the Mess for a drink Most of the officers
were with him and the Subaltern of the Day was preparing to go down
to the lines and receive the watering reports from the TroopSergeant
Majors When Take me to London again stopped after twenty bars every
one in the Mess saidWhat on earth has happened A minute later
they heard unmilitary noises and saw far across the plain the White
Hussars scattered and broken and flying

The Colonel was speechless with rage for he thought that the Regiment
had risen against him or was unanimously drunk The Band a disorganized
mob tore past and at its heels labored the DrumHorsethe dead and
buried DrumHorsewith the jolting clattering skeleton HoganYale
whispered softly to MartynNo wire will stand that treatment and
the Band which had doubled like a hare came back again But the rest
of the Regiment was gone was rioting all over the Province for the
dusk had shut in and each man was howling to his neighbor that the
DrumHorse was on his flank

TroopHorses are far too tenderly treated as a rule They can on
emergencies do a great deal even with seventeen stone on their backs
As the troopers found out

How long this panic lasted I cannot say I believe that when the moon
rose the men saw they had nothing to fear and by twos and threes
and halftroops crept back into Cantonments very much ashamed of
themselves Meantime the DrumHorse disgusted at his treatment by
old friends pulled up wheeled round and trotted up to the Mess
verandahsteps for bread No one liked to run but no one cared to go
forward till the Colonel made a movement and laid hold of the skeletons
foot The Band had halted some distance away and now came back slowly
The Colonel called it individually and collectively every evil name
that occurred to him at the time for he had set his hand on the
bosom of the DrumHorse and found flesh and blood Then he beat the
kettledrums with his clenched fist and discovered that they were but
made of silvered paper and bamboo Next still swearing he tried to
drag the skeleton out of the saddle but found that it had been wired
into the cantle The sight of the Colonel with his arms round the
skeletons pelvis and his knee in the old DrumHorses stomach was
striking Not to say amusing He worried the thing off in a minute or
two and threw it down on the ground saying to the BandHere you
curs thats what youre afraid of The skeleton did not look pretty in
the twilight The BandSergeant seemed to recognize it for he began to
chuckle and choke Shall I take it away sir said the BandSergeant
Yes said the Colonel take it to Hell and ride there yourselves

The BandSergeant saluted hoisted the skeleton across his saddlebow
and led off to the stables Then the Colonel began to make inquiries
for the rest of the Regiment and the language he used was wonderful He
would disband the Regimenthe would courtmartial every soul in ithe
would not command such a set of rabble and so on and so on As the
men dropped in his language grew wilder until at last it exceeded the
utmost limits of free speech allowed even to a Colonel of Horse

Martyn took HoganYale aside and suggested compulsory retirement from
the service as a necessity when all was discovered Martyn was the
weaker man of the two HoganYale put up his eyebrows and remarked
firstly that he was the son of a Lord and secondly that he was
as innocent as the babe unborn of the theatrical resurrection of the
DrumHorse

My instructions said Yale with a singularly sweet smile were that
the DrumHorse should be sent back as impressively as possible
I ask you AM I responsible if a muleheaded friend sends him back
in such a manner as to disturb the peace of mind of a regiment of Her
Majestys Cavalry

Martyn saidyou are a great man and will in time become a General
but Id give my chance of a troop to be safe out of this affair

Providence saved Martyn and HoganYale The SecondinCommand led the
Colonel away to the little curtained alcove wherein the subalterns of
the white Hussars were accustomed to play poker of nights and there
after many oaths on the Colonels part they talked together in low
tones I fancy that the SecondinCommand must have represented the
scare as the work of some trooper whom it would be hopeless to detect
and I know that he dwelt upon the sin and the shame of making a public
laughingstock of the scare

They will call us said the SecondinCommand who had really a fine
imagination they will call us the FlybyNights they will call us
the Ghost Hunters they will nickname us from one end of the Army list
to the other All the explanations in the world wont make outsiders
understand that the officers were away when the panic began For the
honor of the Regiment and for your own sake keep this thing quiet

The Colonel was so exhausted with anger that soothing him down was not
so difficult as might be imagined He was made to see gently and by
degrees that it was obviously impossible to courtmartial the whole
Regiment and equally impossible to proceed against any subaltern who
in his belief had any concern in the hoax

But the beasts alive Hes never been shot at all shouted the
Colonel Its flat flagrant disobedience Ive known a man broke for
less dd sight less Theyre mocking me I tell you Mutman Theyre
mocking me

Once more the SecondinCommand set himself to sooth the Colonel
and wrestled with him for halfanhour At the end of that time the
Regimental SergeantMajor reported himself The situation was rather
novel tell to him but he was not a man to be put out by circumstances
He saluted and said Regiment all come back Sir Then to propitiate
the ColonelAn none of the horses any the worse Sir

The Colonel only snorted and answeredYoud better tuck the men into
their cots then and see that they dont wake up and cry in the night
The Sergeant withdrew

His little stroke of humor pleased the Colonel and further he
felt slightly ashamed of the language he had been using The
SecondinCommand worried him again and the two sat talking far into
the night

Next day but one there was a Commanding Officers parade and the
Colonel harangued the White Hussars vigorously The pith of his speech
was that since the DrumHorse in his old age had proved himself capable
of cutting up the Whole Regiment he should return to his post of pride
at the head of the band BUT the Regiment were a set of ruffians with
bad consciences

The White Hussars shouted and threw everything movable about them into
the air and when the parade was over they cheered the Colonel till
they couldnt speak No cheers were put up for Lieutenant HoganYale
who smiled very sweetly in the background

Said the SecondinCommand to the Colonel unofficiallyThese little
things ensure popularity and do not the least affect discipline

But I went back on my word said the Colonel

Never mind said the SecondinCommand The White Hussars will follow
you anywhere from today Regiments are just like women They will do
anything for trinketry

A week later HoganYale received an extraordinary letter from some one
who signed himself Secretary Charity and Zeal 3709 E C and asked
for the return of our skeleton which we have reason to believe is in
your possession

Who the deuce is this lunatic who trades in bones said HoganYale

Beg your pardon Sir said the BandSergeant but the skeleton is
with me an Ill return it if youll pay the carriage into the Civil
Lines Theres a coffin with it Sir

HoganYale smiled and handed two rupees to the BandSergeant
sayingWrite the date on the skull will you

If you doubt this story and know where to go you can see the date on
the skeleton But dont mention the matter to the White Hussars

I happen to know something about it because I prepared the DrumHorse
for his resurrection He did not take kindly to the skeleton at all




THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCECASE

 In the daytime when she moved about me
 In the night when she was sleeping at my side
 I was wearied I was wearied of her presence

 Day by day and night by night I grew to hate her
 Would to God that she or I had died
 Confessions

There was a man called Bronckhorsta threecornered middleaged man
in the Armygray as a badger and some people said with a touch of
countryblood in him That however cannot be proved

Mrs Bronckhorst was not exactly young though fifteen years younger
than her husband She was a large pale quiet woman with heavy
eyelids over weak eyes and hair that turned red or yellow as the
lights fell on it

Bronckhorst was not nice in any way He had no respect for the pretty
public and private lies that make life a little less nasty than it is
His manner towards his wife was coarse There are many thingsincluding
actual assault with the clenched fistthat a wife will endure but
seldom a wife can bearas Mrs Bronckhorst borewith a long course of
brutal hard chaff making light of her weaknesses her headaches her
small fits of gaiety her dresses her queer little attempts to make
herself attractive to her husband when she knows that she is not
what she has been andworst of allthe love that she spends on her
children That particular sort of heavyhanded jest was specially dear
to Bronckhorst I suppose that he had first slipped into it meaning
no harm in the honeymoon when folk find their ordinary stock of
endearments run short and so go to the other extreme to express their
feelings A similar impulse makes a man sayHutt you old beast
when a favorite horse nuzzles his coatfront Unluckily when the
reaction of marriage sets in the form of speech remains and the
tenderness having died out hurts the wife more than she cares to say
But Mrs Bronckhorst was devoted to her Teddy as she called him

Perhaps that was why he objected to her Perhapsthis is only a theory
to account for his infamous behavior later onhe gave way to the queer
savage feeling that sometimes takes by the throat a husband twenty
years married when he sees across the table the same face of
his wedded wife and knows that as he has sat facing it so must he
continue to sit until day of its death or his own

Most men and all women know the spasm It only lasts for three breaths
as a rule must be a throwback to times when men and women were
rather worse than they are now and is too unpleasant to be discussed

Dinner at the Bronckhorsts was an infliction few men cared to undergo
Bronckhorst took a pleasure in saying things that made his wife wince
When their little boy came in at dessert Bronckhorst used to give him
half a glass of wine and naturally enough the poor little mite got
first riotous next miserable and was removed screaming Bronckhorst
asked if that was the way Teddy usually behaved and whether Mrs
Bronckhorst could not spare some of her time to teach the little beggar
decency Mrs Bronckhorst who loved the boy more than her own life
tried not to cryher spirit seemed to have been broken by her marriage
Lastly Bronckhorst used to sayThere Thatll do thatll do
For Gods sake try to behave like a rational woman Go into the
drawingroom Mrs Bronckhorst would go trying to carry it all
off with a smile and the guest of the evening would feel angry and
uncomfortable

After three years of this cheerful lifefor Mrs Bronckhorst had no
womanfriends to talk tothe Station was startled by the news that
Bronckhorst had instituted proceedings ON THE CRIMINAL COUNT against
a man called Biel who certainly had been rather attentive to Mrs
Bronckhorst whenever she had appeared in public The utter want of
reserve with which Bronckhorst treated his own dishonor helped us to
know that the evidence against Biel would be entirely circumstantial and
native There were no letters but Bronckhorst said openly that he would
rack Heaven and Earth until he saw Biel superintending the manufacture
of carpets in the Central Jail Mrs Bronckhorst kept entirely to her
house and let charitable folks say what they pleased Opinions were
divided Some twothirds of the Station jumped at once to the conclusion
that Biel was guilty but a dozen men who knew and liked him held by
him Biel was furious and surprised He denied the whole thing and
vowed that he would thrash Bronckhorst within an inch of his life
No jury we knew could convict a man on the criminal count on native
evidence in a land where you can buy a murdercharge including the
corpse all complete for fiftyfour rupees but Biel did not care to
scrape through by the benefit of a doubt He wanted the whole thing
cleared but as he said one nightHe can prove anything with
servants evidence and Ive only my bare word This was about a month
before the case came on and beyond agreeing with Biel we could do
little All that we could be sure of was that the native evidence would
be bad enough to blast Biels character for the rest of his service for
when a native begins perjury he perjures himself thoroughly He does not
boggle over details

Some genius at the end of the table whereat the affair was being talked
over saidLook here I dont believe lawyers are any good Get a man
to wire to Strickland and beg him to come down and pull us through

Strickland was about a hundred and eighty miles up the line He had
not long been married to Miss Youghal but he scented in the telegram a
chance of return to the old detective work that his soul lusted after
and next night he came in and heard our story He finished his pipe and
said oracularlyWe must get at the evidence Oorya bearer Mussalman
khit and methraniayah I suppose are the pillars of the charge I am on
in this piece but Im afraid Im getting rusty in my talk

He rose and went into Biels bedroom where his trunk had been put and
shut the door An hour later we heard him sayI hadnt the heart
to part with my old makeups when I married Will this do There was a
lothely faquir salaaming in the doorway

Now lend me fifty rupees said Strickland and give me your Words of
Honor that you wont tell my Wife

He got all that he asked for and left the house while the table drank
his health What he did only he himself knows A faquir hung about
Bronckhorsts compound for twelve days Then a mehter appeared and when
Biel heard of HIM he said that Strickland was an angel fullfledged
Whether the mehter made love to Janki Mrs Bronckhorsts ayah is a
question which concerns Strickland exclusively

He came back at the end of three weeks and said quietlyYou spoke
the truth Biel The whole business is put up from beginning to end
Jove It almost astonishes ME That Bronckhorstbeast isnt fit to
live

There was uproar and shouting and Biel saidHow are you going to
prove it You cant say that youve been trespassing on Bronckhorsts
compound in disguise

No said Strickland Tell your lawyerfool whoever he is to get up
something strong about inherent improbabilities and discrepancies of
evidence He wont have to speak but it will make him happy IM going
to run this business

Biel held his tongue and the other men waited to see what would happen
They trusted Strickland as men trust quiet men When the case came off
the Court was crowded Strickland hung about in the verandah of the
Court till he met the Mohammedan khitmatgar Then he murmured a
faquirs blessing in his ear and asked him how his second wife did The
man spun round and as he looked into the eyes of Estreeken Sahib
his jaw dropped You must remember that before Strickland was married
he was as I have told you already a power among natives Strickland
whispered a rather coarse vernacular proverb to the effect that he was
abreast of all that was going on and went into the Court armed with a
gut trainerswhip

The Mohammedan was the first witness and Strickland beamed upon him from
the back of the Court The man moistened his lips with his tongue and
in his abject fear of Estreeken Sahib the faquir went back on every
detail of his evidencesaid he was a poor man and God was his witness
that he had forgotten every thing that Bronckhorst Sahib had told him
to say Between his terror of Strickland the Judge and Bronckhorst he
collapsed weeping

Then began the panic among the witnesses Janki the ayah leering
chastely behind her veil turned gray and the bearer left the Court He
said that his Mamma was dying and that it was not wholesome for any man
to lie unthriftily in the presence of Estreeken Sahib

Biel said politely to BronckhorstYour witnesses dont seem to work
Havent you any forged letters to produce But Bronckhorst was swaying
to and fro in his chair and there was a dead pause after Biel had been
called to order

Bronckhorsts Counsel saw the look on his clients face and without
more ado pitched his papers on the little green baize table and
mumbled something about having been misinformed The whole Court
applauded wildly like soldiers at a theatre and the Judge began to say
what he thought

Biel came out of the place and Strickland dropped a gut trainerswhip
in the verandah Ten minutes later Biel was cutting Bronckhorst into
ribbons behind the old Court cells quietly and without scandal What
was left of Bronckhorst was sent home in a carriage and his wife wept
over it and nursed it into a man again

Later on after Biel had managed to hush up the countercharge against
Bronckhorst of fabricating false evidence Mrs Bronckhorst with her
faint watery smile said that there had been a mistake but it wasnt
her Teddys fault altogether She would wait till her Teddy came back to
her Perhaps he had grown tired of her or she had tried his patience
and perhaps we wouldnt cut her any more and perhaps the mothers would
let their children play with little Teddy again He was so lonely
Then the Station invited Mrs Bronckhorst everywhere until Bronckhorst
was fit to appear in public when he went Home and took his wife with
him According to the latest advices her Teddy did come back to her
and they are moderately happy Though of course he can never forgive
her the thrashing that she was the indirect means of getting for him


What Biel wants to know isWhy didnt I press home the charge against
the Bronckhorstbrute and have him run in

What Mrs Strickland wants to know isHow DID my husband bring such
a lovely lovely Waler from your Station I know ALL his moneyaffairs
and Im CERTAIN he didnt BUY it

What I want to know isHow do women like Mrs Bronckhorst come to
marry men like Bronckhorst

And my conundrum is the most unanswerable of the three




VENUS ANNODOMINI

 And the years went on as the years must do
 But our great Diana was always new
 Fresh and blooming and blonde and fair
 With azure eyes and with aureate hair
 And all the folk as they came or went
 Offered her praise to her hearts content
 Diana of Ephesus

She had nothing to do with Number Eighteen in the Braccio Nuovo of
the Vatican between Viscontis Ceres and the God of the Nile She was
purely an Indian deityan AngloIndian deity that is to sayand
we called her THE Venus Annodomini to distinguish her from other
Annodominis of the same everlasting order There was a legend among the
Hills that she had once been young but no living man was prepared to
come forward and say boldly that the legend was true

Men rode up to Simla and stayed and went away and made their name and
did their lifes work and returned again to find the Venus Annodomini
exactly as they had left her She was as immutable as the Hills But
not quite so green All that a girl of eighteen could do in the way of
riding walking dancing picnicking and overexertion generally
the Venus Annodomini did and showed no sign of fatigue or trace of
weariness Besides perpetual youth she had discovered men said the
secret of perpetual health and her fame spread about the land From a
mere woman she grew to be an Institution insomuch that no young
man could be said to be properly formed who had not at some time or
another worshipped at the shrine of the Venus Annodomini There was no
one like her though there were many imitations Six years in her
eyes were no more than six months to ordinary women and ten made less
visible impression on her than does a weeks fever on an ordinary woman
Every one adored her and in return she was pleasant and courteous to
nearly every one Youth had been a habit of hers for so long that
she could not part with itnever realized in fact the necessity of
parting with itand took for her more chosen associates young people

Among the worshippers of the Venus Annodomini was young Gayerson

Very Young Gayerson he was called to distinguish him from his father
Young Gayerson a Bengal Civilian who affected the customsas he had
the heartof youth Very Young Gayerson was not content to worship
placidly and for forms sake as the other young men did or to accept
a ride or a dance or a talk from the Venus Annodomini in a properly
humble and thankful spirit He was exacting and therefore the Venus
Annodomini repressed him He worried himself nearly sick in a futile
sort of way over her and his devotion and earnestness made him appear
either shy or boisterous or rude as his mood might vary by the side of
the older men who with him bowed before the Venus Annodomini She was
sorry for him He reminded her of a lad who threeandtwenty years ago
had professed a boundless devotion for her and for whom in return she
had felt something more than a weeks weakness But that lad had fallen
away and married another woman less than a year after he had worshipped
her and the Venus Annodomini had almostnot quiteforgotten his name
Very Young Gayerson had the same big blue eyes and the same way of
pouting his underlip when he was excited or troubled But the Venus
Annodomini checked him sternly none the less Too much zeal was a thing
that she did not approve of preferring instead a tempered and sober
tenderness

Very Young Gayerson was miserable and took no trouble to conceal his
wretchedness He was in the Armya Line regiment I think but am not
certainand since his face was a lookingglass and his forehead an
open book by reason of his innocence his brothers in arms made his
life a burden to him and embittered his naturally sweet disposition No
one except Very Young Gayerson and he never told his views knew how
old Very Young Gayerson believed the Venus Annodomini to be Perhaps
he thought her five and twenty or perhaps she told him that she was
this age Very Young Gayerson would have forded the Gugger in flood to
carry her lightest word and had implicit faith in her Every one liked
him and every one was sorry when they saw him so bound a slave of the
Venus Annodomini Every one too admitted that it was not her fault
for the Venus Annodomini differed from Mrs Hauksbee and Mrs Reiver in
this particularshe never moved a finger to attract any one but like
Ninon de lEnclos all men were attracted to her One could admire and
respect Mrs Hauksbee despise and avoid Mrs Reiver but one was forced
to adore the Venus Annodomini

Very Young Gayersons papa held a Division or a Collectorate
or something administrative in a particularly unpleasant part of
Bengalfull of Babus who edited newspapers proving that Young
Gayerson was a Nero and a Scylla and a Charybdis and in addition
to the Babus there was a good deal of dysentery and cholera abroad
for nine months of the year Young Gayersonhe was about five and
fortyrather liked Babus they amused him but he objects to dysentery
and when he could get away went to Darjiling for the most part This
particular season he fancied that he would come up to Simla and see his
boy The boy was not altogether pleased He told the Venus Annodomini
that his father was coming up and she flushed a little and said that
she should be delighted to make his acquaintance Then she looked long
and thoughtfully at Very Young Gayerson because she was very very
sorry for him and he was a very very big idiot

My daughter is coming out in a fortnight Mr Gayerson she said

Your WHAT said he

Daughter said the Venus Annodomini Shes been out for a year at
Home already and I want her to see a little of India She is nineteen
and a very sensible nice girl I believe

Very Young Gayerson who was a short twentytwo years old nearly fell
out of his chair with astonishment for he had persisted in believing
against all belief in the youth of the Venus Annodomini

 She with her back to the curtained window watched the effect of her
sentences and smiled

Very Young Gayersons papa came up twelve days later and had not been
in Simla four and twenty hours before two men old acquaintances of
his had told him how Very Young Gayerson had been conducting himself

Young Gayerson laughed a good deal and inquired who the Venus
Annodomini might be Which proves that he had been living in Bengal
where nobody knows anything except the rate of Exchange Then he said
boys will be boys and spoke to his son about the matter

Very Young Gayerson said that he felt wretched and unhappy and
Young Gayerson said that he repented of having helped to bring a fool
into the world He suggested that his son had better cut his leave short
and go down to his duties This led to an unfilial answer and relations
were strained until Young Gayerson demanded that they should call on
the Venus Annodomini Very Young Gayerson went with his papa feeling
somehow uncomfortable and small

The Venus Annodomini received them graciously and Young Gayerson
saidBy Jove Its Kitty Very Young Gayerson would have listened
for an explanation if his time had not been taken up with trying to
talk to a large handsome quiet welldressed girlintroduced to him
by the Venus Annodomini as her daughter She was far older in manners
style and repose than Very Young Gayerson and as he realized this
thing he felt sick

Presently he heard the Venus Annodomini sayingDo you know that your
son is one of my most devoted admirers

I dont wonder said Young Gayerson Here he raised his voiceHe
follows his fathers footsteps Didnt I worship the ground you trod on
ever so long ago Kittyand you havent changed since then How strange
it all seems

Very Young Gayerson said nothing His conversation with the daughter
of the Venus Annodomini was through the rest of the call fragmentary
and disjointed

At five tomorrow then said the Venus Annodomini And mind you are
punctual

At five punctual said Young Gayerson You can lend your old father
a horse I dare say youngster cant you Im going for a ride tomorrow
afternoon

Certainly said Very Young Gayerson I am going down tomorrow
morning My ponies are at your service Sir

The Venus Annodomini looked at him across the halflight of the room
and her big gray eyes filled with moisture She rose and shook hands
with him

Goodbye Tom whispered the Venus Annodomini




THE BISARA OF POOREE

 Little Blind Fish thou art marvellous wise
 Little Blind Fish who put out thy eyes
 Open thine ears while I whisper my wish
 Bring me a lover thou little Blind Fish
 The Charm of the Bisara

Some natives say that it came from the other side of Kulu where
the eleveninch Temple Sapphire is Others that it was made at the
DevilShrine of AoChung in Thibet was stolen by a Kafir from him by
a Gurkha from him again by a Lahouli from him by a khitmatgar and by
this latter sold to an Englishman so all its virtue was lost because
to work properly the Bisara of Pooree must be stolenwith bloodshed if
possible but at any rate stolen

These stories of the coming into India are all false It was made at
Pooree ages sincethe manner of its making would fill a small bookwas
stolen by one of the Temple dancinggirls there for her own purposes
and then passed on from hand to hand steadily northward till it
reached Hanla always bearing the same namethe Bisara of Pooree In
shape it is a tiny square box of silver studded outside with eight
small balasrubies Inside the box which opens with a spring is
a little eyeless fish carved from some sort of dark shiny nut and
wrapped in a shred of faded goldcloth That is the Bisara of Pooree
and it were better for a man to take a king cobra in his hand than to
touch the Bisara of Pooree

All kinds of magic are out of date and done away with except in India
where nothing changes in spite of the shiny toyscum stuff that people
call civilization Any man who knows about the Bisara of Pooree will
tell you what its powers arealways supposing that it has been honestly
stolen It is the only regularly working trustworthy lovecharm in the
country with one exception

The other charm is in the hands of a trooper of the Nizams Horse at a
place called Tuprani due north of Hyderabad This can be depended upon
for a fact Some one else may explain it

If the Bisara be not stolen but given or bought or found it turns
against its owner in three years and leads to ruin or death This is
another fact which you may explain when you have time

Meanwhile you can laugh at it At present the Bisara is safe on an
ekkaponys neck inside the blue beadnecklace that keeps off the
Evileye If the ekkadriver ever finds it and wears it or gives it to
his wife I am sorry for him

A very dirty hillcooly woman with goitre owned it at Theog in 1884
It came into Simla from the north before Churtons khitmatgar bought it
and sold it for three times its silvervalue to Churton who collected
curiosities The servant knew no more what he had bought than
the master but a man looking over Churtons collection of
curiositiesChurton was an Assistant Commissioner by the waysaw and
held his tongue He was an Englishman but knew how to believe Which
shows that he was different from most Englishmen He knew that it was
dangerous to have any share in the little box when working or dormant
for unsought Love is a terrible gift

PackGrubby Pack as we used to call himwas in every way a nasty
little man who must have crawled into the Army by mistake He was three
inches taller than his sword but not half so strong And the sword was
a fiftyshilling tailormade one Nobody liked him and I suppose it
was his wizenedness and worthlessness that made him fall so hopelessly
in love with Miss Hollis who was good and sweet and five foot seven in
her tennis shoes He was not content with falling in love quietly
but brought all the strength of his miserable little nature into the
business If he had not been so objectionable one might have pitied
him He vapored and fretted and fumed and trotted up and down and
tried to make himself pleasing in Miss Holliss big quiet gray eyes
and failed It was one of the cases that you sometimes meet even in
this country where we marry by Code of a really blind attachment all on
one side without the faintest possibility of return Miss Hollis
looked on Pack as some sort of vermin running about the road He had
no prospects beyond Captains pay and no wits to help that out by one
anna In a largesized man love like his would have been touching

In a good man it would have been grand He being what he was it was
only a nuisance

You will believe this much What you will not believe is what follows
Churton and The Man who Knew that the Bisara was were lunching at the
Simla Club together Churton was complaining of life in general His
best mare had rolled out of stable down the hill and had broken her
back his decisions were being reversed by the upper Courts more
than an Assistant Commissioner of eight years standing has a right to
expect he knew liver and fever and for weeks past had felt out of
sorts Altogether he was disgusted and disheartened

Simla Club diningroom is built as all the world knows in two
sections with an archarrangement dividing them Come in turn to your
own left take the table under the window and you cannot see any one
who has come in turning to the right and taken a table on the right
side of the arch Curiously enough every word that you say can be
heard not only by the other diner but by the servants beyond the
screen through which they bring dinner This is worth knowing an
echoingroom is a trap to be forewarned against

Half in fun and half hoping to be believed The Man who Knew told
Churton the story of the Bisara of Pooree at rather greater length than
I have told it to you in this place winding up with the suggestion that
Churton might as well throw the little box down the hill and see whether
all his troubles would go with it In ordinary ears English ears the
tale was only an interesting bit of folklore Churton laughed
said that he felt better for his tiffin and went out Pack had been
tiffining by himself to the right of the arch and had heard everything
He was nearly mad with his absurd infatuation for Miss Hollis that all
Simla had been laughing about

It is a curious thing that when a man hates or loves beyond reason he
is ready to go beyond reason to gratify his feelings Which he would not
do for money or power merely Depend upon it Solomon would never have
built altars to Ashtaroth and all those ladies with queer names if
there had not been trouble of some kind in his zenana and nowhere else
But this is beside the story The facts of the case are these Pack
called on Churton next day when Churton was out left his card and
STOLE the Bisara of Pooree from its place under the clock on the
mantelpiece Stole it like the thief he was by nature Three days later
all Simla was electrified by the news that Miss Hollis had accepted
Packthe shrivelled rat Pack Do you desire clearer evidence than
this The Bisara of Pooree had been stolen and it worked as it had
always done when won by foul means

There are three or four times in a mans life when he is justified in
meddling with other peoples affairs to play Providence

The Man who Knew felt that he WAS justified but believing and acting on
a belief are quite different things The insolent satisfaction of Pack
as he ambled by the side of Miss Hollis and Churtons striking release
from liver as soon as the Bisara of Pooree had gone decided the Man
He explained to Churton and Churton laughed because he was not brought
up to believe that men on the Government House List stealat least
little things But the miraculous acceptance by Miss Hollis of that
tailor Pack decided him to take steps on suspicion He vowed that he
only wanted to find out where his rubystudded silver box had vanished
to You cannot accuse a man on the Government House List of stealing
And if you rifle his room you are a thief yourself Churton prompted
by The Man who Knew decided on burglary If he found nothing in Packs
room but it is not nice to think of what would have happened in
that case

Pack went to a dance at BenmoreBenmore WAS Benmore in those days and
not an officeand danced fifteen waltzes out of twentytwo with Miss
Hollis Churton and The Man took all the keys that they could lay hands
on and went to Packs room in the hotel certain that his servants
would be away Pack was a cheap soul He had not purchased a decent
cashbox to keep his papers in but one of those native imitations that
you buy for ten rupees It opened to any sort of key and there at the
bottom under Packs Insurance Policy lay the Bisara of Pooree

Churton called Pack names put the Bisara of Pooree in his pocket and
went to the dance with The Man At least he came in time for supper
and saw the beginning of the end in Miss Holliss eyes She was
hysterical after supper and was taken away by her Mamma

At the dance with the abominable Bisara in his pocket Churton twisted
his foot on one of the steps leading down to the old Rink and had to be
sent home in a rickshaw grumbling He did not believe in the Bisara of
Pooree any the more for this manifestation but he sought out Pack and
called him some ugly names and thief was the mildest of them Pack
took the names with the nervous smile of a little man who wants both
soul and body to resent an insult and went his way There was no public
scandal

A week later Pack got his definite dismissal from Miss Hollis

There had been a mistake in the placing of her affections she said

So he went away to Madras where he can do no great harm even if he
lives to be a Colonel

Churton insisted upon The Man who Knew taking the Bisara of Pooree as a
gift The Man took it went down to the Cart Road at once found an ekka
pony with a blue headnecklace fastened the Bisara of Pooree inside the
necklace with a piece of shoestring and thanked Heaven that he was
rid of a danger Remember in case you ever find it that you must not
destroy the Bisara of Pooree I have not time to explain why just now
but the power lies in the little wooden fish Mister Gubernatis or Max
Muller could tell you more about it than I

You will say that all this story is made up Very well If ever you come
across a little silver rubystudded box seveneighths of an inch long
by threequarters wide with a darkbrown wooden fish wrapped in gold
cloth inside it keep it Keep it for three years and then you will
discover for yourself whether my story is true or false

Better still steal it as Pack did and you will be sorry that you had
not killed yourself in the beginning




THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS

 If I can attain Heaven for a pice why should you be envious
 Opium Smokers Proverb

This is no work of mine My friend Gabral Misquitta the halfcaste
spoke it all between moonset and morning six weeks before he died and
I took it down from his mouth as he answered my questions so

It lies between the Coppersmiths Gully and the pipestem sellers
quarter within a hundred yards too as the crow flies of the Mosque
of Wazir Khan I dont mind telling any one this much but I defy him
to find the Gate however well he may think he knows the City You might
even go through the very gully it stands in a hundred times and be none
the wiser We used to call the gully the Gully of the Black Smoke
but its native name is altogether different of course A loaded donkey
couldnt pass between the walls and at one point just before you
reach the Gate a bulged housefront makes people go along all sideways

It isnt really a gate though Its a house Old FungTching had it
first five years ago He was a bootmaker in Calcutta They say that
he murdered his wife there when he was drunk That was why he dropped
bazarrum and took to the Black Smoke instead Later on he came up
north and opened the Gate as a house where you could get your smoke in
peace and quiet Mind you it was a pukka respectable opiumhouse and
not one of those stifling sweltering chandookhanas that you can find
all over the City No the old man knew his business thoroughly and he
was most clean for a Chinaman He was a oneeyed little chap not much
more than five feet high and both his middle fingers were gone All the
same he was the handiest man at rolling black pills I have ever seen
Never seemed to be touched by the Smoke either and what he took day
and night night and day was a caution Ive been at it five years and
I can do my fair share of the Smoke with any one but I was a child to
FungTching that way All the same the old man was keen on his money
very keen and thats what I cant understand I heard he saved a good
deal before he died but his nephew has got all that now and the old
mans gone back to China to be buried

He kept the big upper room where his best customers gathered as neat
as a new pin In one corner used to stand FungTchings Jossalmost
as ugly as FungTchingand there were always sticks burning under his
nose but you never smelt em when the pipes were going thick Opposite
the Joss was FungTchings coffin He had spent a good deal of his
savings on that and whenever a new man came to the Gate he was always
introduced to it It was lacquered black with red and gold writings
on it and Ive heard that FungTching brought it out all the way from
China I dont know whether thats true or not but I know that if I
came first in the evening I used to spread my mat just at the foot of
it It was a quiet corner you see and a sort of breeze from the gully
came in at the window now and then Besides the mats there was no other
furniture in the roomonly the coffin and the old Joss all green and
blue and purple with age and polish

FungTching never told us why he called the place The Gate of a Hundred
Sorrows He was the only Chinaman I know who used badsounding fancy
names Most of them are flowery As youll see in Calcutta We used
to find that out for ourselves Nothing grows on you so much if youre
white as the Black Smoke A yellow man is made different Opium doesnt
tell on him scarcely at all but white and black suffer a good deal Of
course there are some people that the Smoke doesnt touch any more than
tobacco would at first They just doze a bit as one would fall asleep
naturally and next morning they are almost fit for work Now I was
one of that sort when I began but Ive been at it for five years pretty
steadily and its different now There was an old aunt of mine down
Agra way and she left me a little at her death About sixty rupees a
month secured Sixty isnt much I can recollect a time seems hundreds
and hundreds of years ago that I was getting my three hundred a month
and pickings when I was working on a big timber contract in Calcutta

I didnt stick to that work for long The Black Smoke does not allow of
much other business and even though I am very little affected by it as
men go I couldnt do a days work now to save my life After all sixty
rupees is what I want When old FungTching was alive he used to draw
the money for me give me about half of it to live on I eat very
little and the rest he kept himself I was free of the Gate at any
time of the day and night and could smoke and sleep there when I liked
so I didnt care I know the old man made a good thing out of it but
thats no matter Nothing matters much to me and besides the money
always came fresh and fresh each month

There was ten of us met at the Gate when the place was first opened Me
and two Baboos from a Government Office somewhere in Anarkulli but they
got the sack and couldnt pay no man who has to work in the daylight
can do the Black Smoke for any length of time straight on a Chinaman
that was FungTchings nephew a bazarwoman that had got a lot of
money somehow an English loaferMacSomebody I think but I have
forgottenthat smoked heaps but never seemed to pay anything they
said he had saved FungTchings life at some trial in Calcutta when
he was a barrister another Eurasian like myself from Madras a
halfcaste woman and a couple of men who said they had come from the
North I think they must have been Persians or Afghans or something
There are not more than five of us living now but we come regular I
dont know what happened to the Baboos but the bazarwoman she died
after six months of the Gate and I think FungTching took her bangles
and nosering for himself But Im not certain The Englishman he drank
as well as smoked and he dropped off One of the Persians got killed in
a row at night by the big well near the mosque a long time ago and the
Police shut up the well because they said it was full of foul air

They found him dead at the bottom of it So you see there is only me
the Chinaman the halfcaste woman that we call the Memsahib she used
to live with FungTching the other Eurasian and one of the Persians
The Memsahib looks very old now I think she was a young woman when the
Gate was opened but we are all old for the matter of that Hundreds
and hundreds of years old It is very hard to keep count of time in the
Gate and besides time doesnt matter to me I draw my sixty rupees
fresh and fresh every month

A very very long while ago when I used to be getting three hundred
and fifty rupees a month and pickings on a big timbercontract at
Calcutta I had a wife of sorts But shes dead now People said that I
killed her by taking to the Black Smoke Perhaps I did but its so long
since it doesnt matter Sometimes when I first came to the Gate I used
to feel sorry for it but thats all over and done with long ago and
I draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month and am quite happy
Not DRUNK happy you know but always quiet and soothed and contented

How did I take to it It began at Calcutta I used to try it in my own
house just to see what it was like I never went very far but I think
my wife must have died then Anyhow I found myself here and got to
know FungTching I dont remember rightly how that came about but he
told me of the Gate and I used to go there and somehow I have never
got away from it since Mind you though the Gate was a respectable
place in FungTchings time where you could be comfortable and not at
all like the chandookhanas where the niggers go No it was clean and
quiet and not crowded Of course there were others beside us ten
and the man but we always had a mat apiece with a wadded woollen
headpiece all covered with black and red dragons and things just like
a coffin in the corner

At the end of ones third pipe the dragons used to move about and fight
Ive watched em many and many a night through I used to regulate
my Smoke that way and now it takes a dozen pipes to make em stir
Besides they are all torn and dirty like the mats and old FungTching
is dead He died a couple of years ago and gave me the pipe I always
use nowa silver one with queer beasts crawling up and down the
receiverbottle below the cup Before that I think I used a big bamboo
stem with a copper cup a very small one and a green jade mouthpiece
It was a little thicker than a walkingstick stem and smoked sweet
very sweet The bamboo seemed to suck up the smoke Silver doesnt and
Ive got to clean it out now and then thats a great deal of trouble
but I smoke it for the old mans sake He must have made a good thing
out of me but he always gave me clean mats and pillows and the best
stuff you could get anywhere

When he died his nephew Tsinling took up the Gate and he called it
the Temple of the Three Possessions but we old ones speak of it
as the Hundred Sorrows all the same The nephew does things very
shabbily and I think the Memsahib must help him She lives with him
same as she used to do with the old man The two let in all sorts of low
people niggers and all and the Black Smoke isnt as good as it used
to be Ive found burnt bran in my pipe over and over again The old man
would have died if that had happened in his time Besides the room
is never cleaned and all the mats are torn and cut at the edges The
coffin has gonegone to China againwith the old man and two ounces of
smoke inside it in case he should want em on the way

The Joss doesnt get so many sticks burnt under his nose as he used to
thats a sign of illluck as sure as Death Hes all brown too and
no one ever attends to him Thats the Memsahibs work I know because
when Tsinling tried to burn gilt paper before him she said it was a
waste of money and if he kept a stick burning very slowly the Joss
wouldnt know the difference So now weve got the sticks mixed with
a lot of glue and they take halfanhour longer to burn and smell
stinky Let alone the smell of the room by itself No business can get
on if they try that sort of thing

The Joss doesnt like it I can see that Late at night sometimes he
turns all sorts of queer colorsblue and green and redjust as he used
to do when old FungTching was alive and he rolls his eyes and stamps
his feet like a devil

I dont know why I dont leave the place and smoke quietly in a little
room of my own in the bazar Most like Tsinling would kill me if
I went awayhe draws my sixty rupees nowand besides its so much
trouble and Ive grown to be very fond of the Gate Its not much to
look at Not what it was in the old mans time but I couldnt leave it
Ive seen so many come in and out And Ive seen so many die here on the
mats that I should be afraid of dying in the open now Ive seen some
things that people would call strange enough but nothing is strange
when youre on the Black Smoke except the Black Smoke And if it was
it wouldnt matter

FungTching used to be very particular about his people and never got
in any one whod give trouble by dying messy and such But the nephew
isnt half so careful He tells everywhere that he keeps a firstchop
house Never tries to get men in quietly and make them comfortable like
FungTching did Thats why the Gate is getting a little bit more known
than it used to be Among the niggers of course The nephew darent get
a white or for matter of that a mixed skin into the place He has
to keep us three of courseme and the Memsahib and the other Eurasian
Were fixtures

But he wouldnt give us credit for a pipefulnot for anything

One of these days I hope I shall die in the Gate The Persian and
the Madras man are terrible shaky now Theyve got a boy to light their
pipes for them I always do that myself Most like I shall see them
carried out before me I dont think I shall ever outlive the Memsahib
or Tsinling Women last longer than men at the BlackSmoke and
Tsinling has a deal of the old mans blood in him though he DOES smoke
cheap stuff The bazarwoman knew when she was going two days before her
time and SHE died on a clean mat with a nicely wadded pillow and the
old man hung up her pipe just above the Joss He was always fond of her
I fancy But he took her bangles just the same

I should like to die like the bazarwomanon a clean cool mat with a
pipe of good stuff between my lips When I feel Im going I shall ask
Tsinling for them and he can draw my sixty rupees a month fresh and
fresh as long as he pleases and watch the black and red dragons have
their last big fight together and then

Well it doesnt matter Nothing matters much to meonly I wished
Tsinling wouldnt put bran into the Black Smoke




THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN

 Who is the happy man He that sees in his own house at home little
 children crowned with dust leaping and falling and crying
 Munichandra translated by Professor Peterson

The poloball was an old one scarred chipped and dinted It stood
on the mantelpiece among the pipestems which Imam Din khitmatgar was
cleaning for me

Does the Heavenborn want this ball said Imam Din deferentially

The Heavenborn set no particular store by it but of what use was a
poloball to a khitmatgar

By Your Honors favor I have a little son He has seen this ball and
desires it to play with I do not want it for myself

No one would for an instant accuse portly old Imam Din of wanting
to play with poloballs He carried out the battered thing into the
verandah and there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks a patter of
small feet and the thudthudthud of the ball rolling along the ground
Evidently the little son had been waiting outside the door to secure his
treasure But how had he managed to see that poloball

Next day coming back from office half an hour earlier than usual I was
aware of a small figure in the diningrooma tiny plump figure in a
ridiculously inadequate shirt which came perhaps halfway down the
tubby stomach It wandered round the room thumb in mouth crooning
to itself as it took stock of the pictures Undoubtedly this was the
little son

He had no business in my room of course but was so deeply absorbed in
his discoveries that he never noticed me in the doorway I stepped into
the room and startled him nearly into a fit He sat down on the ground
with a gasp His eyes opened and his mouth followed suit I knew what
was coming and fled followed by a long dry howl which reached the
servants quarters far more quickly than any command of mine had ever
done In ten seconds Imam Din was in the diningroom Then despairing
sobs arose and I returned to find Imam Din admonishing the small sinner
who was using most of his shirt as a handkerchief

This boy said Imam Din judicially is a budmash a big budmash
He will without doubt go to the jailkhana for his behavior Renewed
yells from the penitent and an elaborate apology to myself from Imam
Din

Tell the baby said I that the Sahib is not angry and take him
away Imam Din conveyed my forgiveness to the offender who had
now gathered all his shirt round his neck stringwise and the yell
subsided into a sob The two set off for the door His name said Imam
Din as though the name were part of the crime is Muhammad Din and he
is a budmash Freed from present danger Muhammad Din turned round
in his fathers arms and said gravelyIt is true that my name is
Muhammad Din Tahib but I am not a budmash I am a MAN

From that day dated my acquaintance with Muhammad Din Never again did
he come into my diningroom but on the neutral ground of the compound
we greeted each other with much state though our conversation was
confined to Talaam Tahib from his side and Salaam Muhammad Din from
mine Daily on my return from office the little white shirt and the
fat little body used to rise from the shade of the creepercovered
trellis where they had been hid and daily I checked my horse here that
my salutation might not be slurred over or given unseemly

Muhammad Din never had any companions He used to trot about the
compound in and out of the castoroil bushes on mysterious errands
of his own One day I stumbled upon some of his handiwork far down
the ground He had half buried the poloball in dust and stuck six
shrivelled old marigold flowers in a circle round it Outside that
circle again was a rude square traced out in bits of red brick
alternating with fragments of broken china the whole bounded by a
little bank of dust The bhistie from the wellcurb put in a plea for
the small architect saying that it was only the play of a baby and did
not much disfigure my garden

Heaven knows that I had no intention of touching the childs work then
or later but that evening a stroll through the garden brought me
unawares full on it so that I trampled before I knew marigoldheads
dustbank and fragments of broken soapdish into confusion past all
hope of mending Next morning I came upon Muhammad Din crying softly to
himself over the ruin I had wrought

Some one had cruelly told him that the Sahib was very angry with him for
spoiling the garden and had scattered his rubbish using bad language
the while Muhammad Din labored for an hour at effacing every trace
of the dustbank and pottery fragments and it was with a tearful
apologetic face that he said Talaam Tahib when I came home from the
office A hasty inquiry resulted in Imam Din informing Muhammad Din that
by my singular favor he was permitted to disport himself as he pleased
Whereat the child took heart and fell to tracing the groundplan of an
edifice which was to eclipse the marigoldpoloball creation

For some months the chubby little eccentricity revolved in his humble
orbit among the castoroil bushes and in the dust always fashioning
magnificent palaces from stale flowers thrown away by the bearer smooth
waterworn pebbles bits of broken glass and feathers pulled I fancy
from my fowlsalways alone and always crooning to himself

A gaylyspotted seashell was dropped one day close to the last of his
little buildings and I looked that Muhammad Din should build something
more than ordinarily splendid on the strength of it Nor was I
disappointed He meditated for the better part of an hour and his
crooning rose to a jubilant song Then he began tracing in dust It
would certainly be a wondrous palace this one for it was two
yards long and a yard broad in groundplan But the palace was never
completed

Next day there was no Muhammad Din at the head of the carriagedrive
and no Talaam Tahib to welcome my return I had grown accustomed to
the greeting and its omission troubled me Next day Imam Din told me
that the child was suffering slightly from fever and needed quinine He
got the medicine and an English Doctor

They have no stamina these brats said the Doctor as he left Imam
Dins quarters

A week later though I would have given much to have avoided it I met
on the road to the Mussulman buryingground Imam Din accompanied by one
other friend carrying in his arms wrapped in a white cloth all that
was left of little Muhammad Din




ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS

 If your mirror be broken look into still water but have a care
 that you do not fall in
 Hindu Proverb

Next to a requited attachment one of the most convenient things that a
young man can carry about with him at the beginning of his career is
an unrequited attachment It makes him feel important and businesslike
and blase and cynical and whenever he has a touch of liver or suffers
from want of exercise he can mourn over his lost love and be very
happy in a tender twilight fashion

Hannasydes affair of the heart had been a Godsend to him It was four
years old and the girl had long since given up thinking of it

She had married and had many cares of her own In the beginning she
had told Hannasyde that while she could never be anything more than
a sister to him she would always take the deepest interest in his
welfare This startlingly new and original remark gave Hannasyde
something to think over for two years and his own vanity filled in
the other twentyfour months Hannasyde was quite different from Phil
Garron but none the less had several points in common with that far
too lucky man

He kept his unrequited attachment by him as men keep a wellsmoked
pipefor comforts sake and because it had grown dear in the using It
brought him happily through the Simla season Hannasyde was not lovely
There was a crudity in his manners and a roughness in the way in which
he helped a lady on to her horse that did not attract the other sex
to him Even if he had cast about for their favor which he did not He
kept his wounded heart all to himself for a while

Then trouble came to him All who go to Simla know the slope from the
Telegraph to the Public Works Office Hannasyde was loafing up the hill
one September morning between calling hours when a rickshaw came down
in a hurry and in the rickshaw sat the living breathing image of the
girl who had made him so happily unhappy

Hannasyde leaned against the railing and gasped He wanted to run
downhill after the rickshaw but that was impossible so he went
forward with most of his blood in his temples It was impossible for
many reasons that the woman in the rickshaw could be the girl he had
known She was he discovered later the wife of a man from Dindigul or
Coimbatore or some outoftheway place and she had come up to Simla
early in the season for the good of her health

She was going back to Dindigul or wherever it was at the end of the
season and in all likelihood would never return to Simla again her
proper Hillstation being Ootacamund That night Hannasyde raw and
savage from the raking up of all old feelings took counsel with himself
for one measured hour What he decided upon was this and you must
decide for yourself how much genuine affection for the old love and how
much a very natural inclination to go abroad and enjoy himself affected
the decision Mrs LandysHaggert would never in all human likelihood
cross his path again So whatever he did didnt much matter She was
marvellously like the girl who took a deep interest and the rest of
the formula All things considered it would be pleasant to make the
acquaintance of Mrs LandysHaggert and for a little timeonly a very
little timeto make believe that he was with Alice Chisane again Every
one is more or less mad on one point Hannasydes particular monomania
was his old love Alice Chisane

He made it his business to get introduced to Mrs Haggert and the
introduction prospered He also made it his business to see as much as
he could of that lady When a man is in earnest as to interviews the
facilities which Simla offers are startling There are gardenparties
and tennisparties and picnics and luncheons at Annandale and
riflematches and dinners and balls besides rides and walks which are
matters of private arrangement

Hannasyde had started with the intention of seeing a likeness and
he ended by doing much more He wanted to be deceived he meant to be
deceived and he deceived himself very thoroughly Not only were the
face and figure the face and figure of Alice Chisane but the voice and
lower tones were exactly the same and so were the turns of speech and
the little mannerisms that every woman has of gait and gesticulation
were absolutely and identically the same The turn of the head was the
same the tired look in the eyes at the end of a long walk was the same
the sloop and wrench over the saddle to hold in a pulling horse was the
same and once most marvellous of all Mrs LandysHaggert singing to
herself in the next room while Hannasyde was waiting to take her for a
ride hummed note for note with a throaty quiver of the voice in the
second linePoor Wandering One exactly as Alice Chisane had hummed
it for Hannasyde in the dusk of an English drawingroom In the actual
woman herselfin the soul of herthere was not the least likeness she
and Alice Chisane being cast in different moulds But all that
Hannasyde wanted to know and see and think about was this maddening and
perplexing likeness of face and voice and manner He was bent on making
a fool of himself that way and he was in no sort disappointed

Open and obvious devotion from any sort of man is always pleasant to
any sort of woman but Mrs LandysHaggert being a woman of the world
could make nothing of Hannasydes admiration

He would take any amount of troublehe was a selfish man habituallyto
meet and forestall if possible her wishes

Anything she told him to do was law and he was there could be no
doubting it fond of her company so long as she talked to him and kept
on talking about trivialities But when she launched into expression of
her personal views and her wrongs those small social differences
that make the spice of Simla life Hannasyde was neither pleased nor
interested He didnt want to know anything about Mrs LandysHaggert
or her experiences in the pastshe had travelled nearly all over the
world and could talk cleverlyhe wanted the likeness of Alice Chisane
before his eyes and her voice in his ears

Anything outside that reminding him of another personality jarred and
he showed that it did

Under the new Post Office one evening Mrs LandysHaggert turned on
him and spoke her mind shortly and without warning Mr Hannasyde
said she will you be good enough to explain why you have appointed
yourself my special cavalier servente I dont understand it But I
am perfectly certain somehow or other that you dont care the least
little bit in the world for ME This seems to support by the way the
theory that no man can act or tell lies to a woman without being found
out Hannasyde was taken off his guard His defence never was a strong
one because he was always thinking of himself and he blurted out
before he knew what he was saying this inexpedient answerNo more I
do

The queerness of the situation and the reply made Mrs Haggert laugh
Then it all came out and at the end of Hannasydes lucid explanation
Mrs Haggert said with the least little touch of scorn in her
voiceSo Im to act as the layfigure for you to hang the rags of
your tattered affections on am I

Hannasyde didnt see what answer was required and he devoted himself
generally and vaguely to the praise of Alice Chisane which was
unsatisfactory Now it is to be thoroughly made clear that Mrs Haggert
had not the shadow of a ghost of an interest in Hannasyde

Onlyonly no woman likes being made love through instead of
tospecially on behalf of a musty divinity of four years standing

Hannasyde did not see that he had made any very particular exhibition
of himself He was glad to find a sympathetic soul in the arid wastes of
Simla

When the season ended Hannasyde went down to his own place and Mrs
Haggert to hers It was like making love to a ghost said Hannasyde
to himself and it doesnt matter and now Ill get to my work But
he found himself thinking steadily of the HaggertChisane ghost and he
could not be certain whether it was Haggert or Chisane that made up the
greater part of the pretty phantom

He got understanding a month later

A peculiar point of this peculiar country is the way in which a
heartless Government transfers men from one end of the Empire to the
other You can never be sure of getting rid of a friend or an enemy till
he or she dies There was a case oncebut thats another story

Haggerts Department ordered him up from Dindigul to the Frontier at
two days notice and he went through losing money at every step from
Dindigul to his station He dropped Mrs Haggert at Lucknow to stay
with some friends there to take part in a big ball at the Chutter
Munzil and to come on when he had made the new home a little
comfortable Lucknow was Hannasydes station and Mrs Haggert stayed
a week there Hannasyde went to meet her And the train came in
he discovered which he had been thinking of for the past month The
unwisdom of his conduct also struck him The Lucknow week with two
dances and an unlimited quantity of rides together clinched matters
and Hannasyde found himself pacing this circle of thoughtHe
adored Alice Chisaneat least he HAD adored her AND he admired
Mrs LandysHaggert because she was like Alice Chisane BUT Mrs
LandysHaggert was not in the least like Alice Chisane being a thousand
times more adorable NOW Alice Chisane was the bride of another and
so was Mrs LandysHaggert and a good and honest wife too THEREFORE
he Hannasyde was here he called himself several hard names
and wished that he had been wise in the beginning

Whether Mrs LandysHaggert saw what was going on in his mind she alone
knows He seemed to take an unqualified interest in everything connected
with herself as distinguished from the AliceChisane likeness and he
said one or two things which if Alice Chisane had been still betrothed
to him could scarcely have been excused even on the grounds of the
likeness But Mrs Haggert turned the remarks aside and spent a long
time in making Hannasyde see what a comfort and a pleasure she had been
to him because of her strange resemblance to his old love Hannasyde
groaned in his saddle and said Yes indeed and busied himself with
preparations for her departure to the Frontier feeling very small and
miserable

The last day of her stay at Lucknow came and Hannasyde saw her off
at the Railway Station She was very grateful for his kindness and the
trouble he had taken and smiled pleasantly and sympathetically as one
who knew the AliceChisane reason of that kindness And Hannasyde abused
the coolies with the luggage and hustled the people on the platform
and prayed that the roof might fall in and slay him

As the train went out slowly Mrs LandysHaggert leaned out of the
window to say goodbyeOn second thoughts au revoir Mr Hannasyde I
go Home in the Spring and perhaps I may meet you in Town

Hannasyde shook hands and said very earnestly and adoringlyI hope
to Heaven I shall never see your face again

And Mrs Haggert understood




WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE

 I closed and drew for my loves sake
 That now is false to me
 And I slew the Riever of Tarrant Moss
 And set Dumeny free

 And ever they give me praise and gold
 And ever I moan my loss
 For I struck the blow for my false loves sake
 And not for the men at the Moss
 Tarrant Moss

One of the many curses of our life out here is the want of atmosphere in
the painters sense There are no halftints worth noticing Men stand
out all crude and raw with nothing to tone them down and nothing to
scale them against They do their work and grow to think that there is
nothing but their work and nothing like their work and that they are
the real pivots on which the administration turns Here is an instance
of this feeling A halfcaste clerk was ruling forms in a Pay Office He
said to meDo you know what would happen if I added or took away one
single line on this sheet Then with the air of a conspiratorIt
would disorganize the whole of the Treasury payments throughout the
whole of the Presidency Circle Think of that

If men had not this delusion as to the ultraimportance of their own
particular employments I suppose that they would sit down and kill
themselves But their weakness is wearisome particularly when the
listener knows that he himself commits exactly the same sin

Even the Secretariat believes that it does good when it asks an
overdriven Executive Officer to take census of wheatweevils through a
district of five thousand square miles

There was a man once in the Foreign Officea man who had grown
middleaged in the department and was commonly said by irreverent
juniors to be able to repeat Aitchisons Treaties and Sunnuds
backwards in his sleep What he did with his stored knowledge only the
Secretary knew and he naturally would not publish the news abroad
This mans name was Wressley and it was the Shibboleth in those days
to sayWressley knows more about the Central Indian States than any
living man If you did not say this you were considered one of mean
understanding

Nowadays the man who says that he knows the ravel of the intertribal
complications across the Border is of more use but in Wressleys time
much attention was paid to the Central Indian States They were called
foci and factors and all manner of imposing names

And here the curse of AngloIndian life fell heavily When Wressley
lifted up his voice and spoke about suchandsuch a succession to
suchandsuch a throne the Foreign Office were silent and Heads
of Departments repeated the last two or three words of Wressleys
sentences and tacked yes yes on them and knew that they were
assisting the Empire to grapple with seriouspolitical contingencies
In most big undertakings one or two men do the work while the rest sit
near and talk till the ripe decorations begin to fall

Wressley was the workingmember of the Foreign Office firm and to keep
him up to his duties when he showed signs of flagging he was made much
of by his superiors and told what a fine fellow he was

He did not require coaxing because he was of tough build but what
he received confirmed him in the belief that there was no one quite
so absolutely and imperatively necessary to the stability of India as
Wressley of the Foreign Office There might be other good men but the
known honored and trusted man among men was Wressley of the Foreign
Office We had a Viceroy in those days who knew exactly when to gentle
a fractious big man and to hearten up a collargalled little one and so
keep all his team level He conveyed to Wressley the impression which I
have just set down and even tough men are apt to be disorganized by a
Viceroys praise There was a case oncebut that is another story

All India knew Wressleys name and officeit was in Thacker and Spinks
Directorybut who he was personally or what he did or what his
special merits were not fifty men knew or cared His work filled all
his time and he found no leisure to cultivate acquaintances beyond
those of dead Rajput chiefs with Ahir blots in their scutcheons
Wressley would have made a very good Clerk in the Heralds College had
he not been a Bengal Civilian

Upon a day between office and office great trouble came to
Wressleyoverwhelmed him knocked him down and left him gasping
as though he had been a little schoolboy Without reason against
prudence and at a moments notice he fell in love with a frivolous
goldenhaired girl who used to tear about Simla Mall on a high rough
waler with a blue velvet jockeycap crammed over her eyes Her name was
VennerTillie Vennerand she was delightful

She took Wressleys heart at a handgallop and Wressley found that it
was not good for man to live alone even with half the Foreign Office
Records in his presses

Then Simla laughed for Wressley in love was slightly ridiculous

He did his best to interest the girl in himselfthat is to say
his workand she after the manner of women did her best to appear
interested in what behind his back she called Mr Wressleys Wajahs
for she lisped very prettily She did not understand one little thing
about them but she acted as if she did Men have married on that sort
of error before now

Providence however had care of Wressley He was immensely struck with
Miss Venners intelligence He would have been more impressed had
he heard her private and confidential accounts of his calls He held
peculiar notions as to the wooing of girls He said that the best work
of a mans career should be laid reverently at their feet

Ruskin writes something like this somewhere I think but in ordinary
life a few kisses are better and save time

About a month after he had lost his heart to Miss Venner and had been
doing his work vilely in consequence the first idea of his Native Rule
in Central India struck Wressley and filled him with joy It was as he
sketched it a great thingthe work of his lifea really comprehensive
survey of a most fascinating subjectto be written with all the special
and laboriously acquired knowledge of Wressley of the Foreign Officea
gift fit for an Empress

He told Miss Venner that he was going to take leave and hoped on his
return to bring her a present worthy of her acceptance Would she wait
Certainly she would Wressley drew seventeen hundred rupees a month She
would wait a year for that Her mamma would help her to wait

So Wressley took one years leave and all the available documents about
a truckload that he could lay hands on and went down to Central India
with his notion hot in his head He began his book in the land he was
writing of Too much official correspondence had made him a frigid
workman and he must have guessed that he needed the white light of
local color on his palette This is a dangerous paint for amateurs to
play with

Heavens how that man worked He caught his Rajahs analyzed his Rajahs
and traced them up into the mists of Time and beyond with their
queens and their concubines He dated and crossdated pedigreed and
triplepedigreed compared noted connoted wove strung sorted
selected inferred calendared and countercalendared for ten hours a
day And because this sudden and new light of Love was upon him he
turned those dry bones of history and dirty records of misdeeds into
things to weep or to laugh over as he pleased His heart and soul were
at the end of his pen and they got into the ink He was dowered with
sympathy insight humor and style for two hundred and thirty days and
nights and his book was a Book He had his vast special knowledge with
him so to speak but the spirit the wovenin human Touch the poetry
and the power of the output were beyond all special knowledge But I
doubt whether he knew the gift that was in him then and thus he may
have lost some happiness He was toiling for Tillie Venner not for
himself

Men often do their best work blind for some one elses sake

Also though this has nothing to do with the story in India where every
one knows every one else you can watch men being driven by the women
who govern them out of the rankandfile and sent to take up points
alone A good man once started goes forward but an average man so
soon as the woman loses interest in his success as a tribute to her
power comes back to the battalion and is no more heard of

Wressley bore the first copy of his book to Simla and blushing and
stammering presented it to Miss Venner She read a little of it

I give her review verbatimOh your book Its all about those
howwid Wajahs I didnt understand it

Wressley of the Foreign Office was broken smashedI am not
exaggeratingby this one frivolous little girl All that he could say
feebly wasBut but its my magnum opus The work of my life Miss
Venner did not know what magnum opus meant but she knew that Captain
Kerrington had won three races at the last Gymkhana Wressley didnt
press her to wait for him any longer He had sense enough for that

Then came the reaction after the years strain and Wressley went back
to the Foreign Office and his Wajahs a compiling gazetteering
reportwriting hack who would have been dear at three hundred rupees
a month He abided by Miss Venners review Which proves that the
inspiration in the book was purely temporary and unconnected with
himself Nevertheless he had no right to sink in a hilltarn five
packingcases brought up at enormous expense from Bombay of the best
book of Indian history ever written

When he sold off before retiring some years later I was turning over
his shelves and came across the only existing copy of Native Rule in
Central Indiathe copy that Miss Venner could not understand I read
it sitting on his muletrucks as long as the light lasted and offered
him his own price for it He looked over my shoulder for a few pages and
said to himself drearilyNow how in the world did I come to write
such damned good stuff as that Then to meTake it and keep
it Write one of your pennyfarthing yarns about its birth
Perhapsperhapsthe whole business may have been ordained to that
end

Which knowing what Wressley of the Foreign Office was once struck me
as about the bitterest thing that I had ever heard a man say of his own
work




BY WORD OF MOUTH

 Not though you die tonight O Sweet and wail
 A spectre at my door
 Shall mortal Fear make Love immortal fail
 I shall but love you more
 Who from Deaths house returning give me still
 One moments comfort in my matchless ill
 Shadow Houses

This tale may be explained by those who know how souls are made and
where the bounds of the Possible are put down I have lived long enough
in this country to know that it is best to know nothing and can only
write the story as it happened

Dumoise was our Civil Surgeon at Meridki and we called him Dormouse
because he was a round little sleepy little man He was a good
Doctor and never quarrelled with any one not even with our Deputy
Commissioner who had the manners of a bargee and the tact of a horse
He married a girl as round and as sleepylooking as himself She was
a Miss Hillardyce daughter of Squash Hillardyce of the Berars who
married his Chiefs daughter by mistake But that is another story

A honeymoon in India is seldom more than a week long but there is
nothing to hinder a couple from extending it over two or three years
This is a delightful country for married folk who are wrapped up in one
another They can live absolutely alone and without interruptionjust
as the Dormice did These two little people retired from the world after
their marriage and were very happy They were forced of course
to give occasional dinners but they made no friends hereby and the
Station went its own way and forgot them only saying occasionally
that Dormouse was the best of good fellows though dull A Civil Surgeon
who never quarrels is a rarity appreciated as such

Few people can afford to play Robinson Crusoe anywhereleast of all
in India where we are few in the land and very much dependent on each
others kind offices Dumoise was wrong in shutting himself from the
world for a year and he discovered his mistake when an epidemic of
typhoid broke out in the Station in the heart of the cold weather and
his wife went down He was a shy little man and five days were wasted
before he realized that Mrs Dumoise was burning with something worse
than simple fever and three days more passed before he ventured to call
on Mrs Shute the Engineers wife and timidly speak about his trouble
Nearly every household in India knows that Doctors are very helpless
in typhoid The battle must be fought out between Death and the Nurses
minute by minute and degree by degree Mrs Shute almost boxed Dumoises
ears for what she called his criminal delay and went off at once to
look after the poor girl We had seven cases of typhoid in the Station
that winter and as the average of death is about one in every five
cases we felt certain that we should have to lose somebody But all did
their best The women sat up nursing the women and the men turned
to and tended the bachelors who were down and we wrestled with those
typhoid cases for fiftysix days and brought them through the Valley of
the Shadow in triumph But just when we thought all was over and were
going to give a dance to celebrate the victory little Mrs Dumoise
got a relapse and died in a week and the Station went to the funeral
Dumoise broke down utterly at the brink of the grave and had to be
taken away

After the death Dumoise crept into his own house and refused to be
comforted He did his duties perfectly but we all felt that he should
go on leave and the other men of his own Service told him so Dumoise
was very thankful for the suggestionhe was thankful for anything in
those daysand went to Chini on a walkingtour

Chini is some twenty marches from Simla in the heart of the Hills and
the scenery is good if you are in trouble You pass through big
still deodarforests and under big still cliffs and over big still
grassdowns swelling like a womans breasts and the wind across the
grass and the rain among the deodars saysHushhushhush So
little Dumoise was packed off to Chini to wear down his grief with a
fullplate camera and a rifle He took also a useless bearer because
the man had been his wifes favorite servant He was idle and a thief
but Dumoise trusted everything to him

On his way back from Chini Dumoise turned aside to Bagi through the
Forest Reserve which is on the spur of Mount Huttoo Some men who have
travelled more than a little say that the march from Kotegarh to Bagi is
one of the finest in creation It runs through dark wet forest and ends
suddenly in bleak nipped hillside and black rocks Bagi dakbungalow
is open to all the winds and is bitterly cold Few people go to Bagi
Perhaps that was the reason why Dumoise went there He halted at seven
in the evening and his bearer went down the hillside to the village
to engage coolies for the next days march The sun had set and the
nightwinds were beginning to croon among the rocks Dumoise leaned on
the railing of the verandah waiting for his bearer to return The man
came back almost immediately after he had disappeared and at such a
rate that Dumoise fancied he must have crossed a bear He was running as
hard as he could up the face of the hill

But there was no bear to account for his terror He raced to the
verandah and fell down the blood spurting from his nose and his face
irongray Then he gurgledI have seen the Memsahib I have seen the
Memsahib

Where said Dumoise

Down there walking on the road to the village She was in a blue
dress and she lifted the veil of her bonnet and saidRam Dass give
my salaams to the Sahib and tell him that I shall meet him next month
at Nuddea Then I ran away because I was afraid

What Dumoise said or did I do not know Ram Dass declares that he said
nothing but walked up and down the verandah all the cold night waiting
for the Memsahib to come up the hill and stretching out his arms into
the dark like a madman But no Memsahib came and next day he went on
to Simla crossquestioning the bearer every hour

Ram Dass could only say that he had met Mrs Dumoise and that she had
lifted up her veil and given him the message which he had faithfully
repeated to Dumoise To this statement Ram Dass adhered

He did not know where Nuddea was had no friends at Nuddea and would
most certainly never go to Nuddea even though his pay were doubled

Nuddea is in Bengal and has nothing whatever to do with a doctor
serving in the Punjab It must be more than twelve hundred miles from
Meridki

Dumoise went through Simla without halting and returned to Meridki
there to take over charge from the man who had been officiating for him
during his tour There were some Dispensary accounts to be explained
and some recent orders of the SurgeonGeneral to be noted and
altogether the takingover was a full days work In the evening
Dumoise told his locum tenens who was an old friend of his bachelor
days what had happened at Bagi and the man said that Ram Dass might as
well have chosen Tuticorin while he was about it

At that moment a telegraphpeon came in with a telegram from Simla
ordering Dumoise not to take over charge at Meridki but to go at once
to Nuddea on special duty There was a nasty outbreak of cholera at
Nuddea and the Bengal Government being shorthanded as usual had
borrowed a Surgeon from the Punjab

Dumoise threw the telegram across the table and saidWell

The other Doctor said nothing It was all that he could say

Then he remembered that Dumoise had passed through Simla on his way
from Bagi and thus might possibly have heard the first news of the
impending transfer

He tried to put the question and the implied suspicion into words but
Dumoise stopped him withIf I had desired THAT I should never have
come back from Chini I was shooting there I wish to live for I have
things to do but I shall not be sorry

The other man bowed his head and helped in the twilight to pack up
Dumoises just opened trunks Ram Dass entered with the lamps

Where is the Sahib going he asked

To Nuddea said Dumoise softly

Ram Dass clawed Dumoises knees and boots and begged him not to go

Ram Dass wept and howled till he was turned out of the room Then he
wrapped up all his belongings and came back to ask for a character
He was not going to Nuddea to see his Sahib die and perhaps to die
himself

So Dumoise gave the man his wages and went down to Nuddea alone the
other Doctor bidding him goodbye as one under sentence of death

Eleven days later he had joined his Memsahib and the Bengal Government
had to borrow a fresh Doctor to cope with that epidemic at Nuddea The
first importation lay dead in Chooadanga DakBungalow




TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE

 By the hoof of the Wild Goat uptossed
 From the Cliff where She lay in the Sun
 Fell the Stone To the Tarn where the daylight is lost
 So She fell from the light of the Sun
 And alone

 Now the fall was ordained from the first
 With the Goat and the Cliff and the Tarn
 But the Stone Knows only Her life is accursed
 As She sinks in the depths of the Tarn
 And alone

 Oh Thou who has builded the world
 Oh Thou who hast lighted the Sun
 Oh Thou who hast darkened the Tarn
 Judge Thou The Sin of the Stone that was hurled
 By the Goat from the light of the Sun
 As She sinks in the mire of the Tarn
 Even noweven noweven now
 From the Unpublished Papers of McIntosh Jellaludin

 Say is it dawn is it dusk in thy Bower
 Thou whom I long for who longest for me
 Oh be it nightbe it

Here he fell over a little camelcolt that was sleeping in the Serai
where the horsetraders and the best of the blackguards from Central
Asia live and because he was very drunk indeed and the night was dark
he could not rise again till I helped him That was the beginning of my
acquaintance with McIntosh Jellaludin When a loafer and drunk sings
The Song of the Bower he must be worth cultivating He got off the
camels back and said rather thicklyIIIm a bit screwed but a
dip in Loggerhead will put me right again and I say have you spoken to
Symonds about the mares knees

Now Loggerhead was six thousand weary miles away from us close to
Mesopotamia where you mustnt fish and poaching is impossible and
Charley Symonds stable a half mile further across the paddocks It was
strange to hear all the old names on a May night among the horses
and camels of the Sultan Caravanserai Then the man seemed to remember
himself and sober down at the same time He leaned against the camel and
pointed to a corner of the Serai where a lamp was burning

I live there said he and I should be extremely obliged if you would
be good enough to help my mutinous feet thither for I am more than
usually drunkmostmost phenomenally tight But not in respect to my
head My brain cries out againsthow does it go But my head rides on
therolls on the dunghill I should have said and controls the qualm

I helped him through the gangs of tethered horses and he collapsed on
the edge of the verandah in front of the line of native quarters

Thanksa thousand thanks O Moon and little little Stars To think
that a man should so shamelessly Infamous liquor too Ovid in
exile drank no worse Better It was frozen Alas I had no ice Good
night I would introduce you to my wife were I soberor she civilized

A native woman came out of the darkness of the room and began calling
the man names so I went away He was the most interesting loafer that
I had the pleasure of knowing for a long time and later on he became
a friend of mine He was a tall wellbuilt fair man fearfully shaken
with drink and he looked nearer fifty than the thirtyfive which he
said was his real age When a man begins to sink in India and is not
sent Home by his friends as soon as may be he falls very low from a
respectable point of view By the time that he changes his creed as did
McIntosh he is past redemption

In most big cities natives will tell you of two or three Sahibs
generally lowcaste who have turned Hindu or Mussulman and who live
more or less as such But it is not often that you can get to know
them As McIntosh himself used to sayIf I change my religion for my
stomachs sake I do not seek to become a martyr to missionaries nor am
I anxious for notoriety

At the outset of acquaintance McIntosh warned me Remember this I am
not an object for charity I require neither your money your food
nor your castoff raiment I am that rare animal a selfsupporting
drunkard If you choose I will smoke with you for the tobacco of the
bazars does not I admit suit my palate and I will borrow any books
which you may not specially value It is more than likely that I shall
sell them for bottles of excessively filthy countryliquors In return
you shall share such hospitality as my house affords Here is a charpoy
on which two can sit and it is possible that there may from time to
time be food in that platter Drink unfortunately you will find on
the premises at any hour and thus I make you welcome to all my poor
establishments

I was admitted to the McIntosh householdI and my good tobacco

But nothing else Unluckily one cannot visit a loafer in the Serai by
day Friends buying horses would not understand it

Consequently I was obliged to see McIntosh after dark He laughed
at this and said simplyYou are perfectly right When I enjoyed
a position in society rather higher than yours I should have done
exactly the same thing Good Heavens I was oncehe spoke as though
he had fallen from the Command of a Regimentan Oxford Man This
accounted for the reference to Charley Symonds stable

You said McIntosh slowly have not had that advantage but to
outward appearance you do not seem possessed of a craving for strong
drinks On the whole I fancy that you are the luckier of the two Yet
I am not certain You areforgive my saying so even while I am smoking
your excellent tobaccopainfully ignorant of many things

We were sitting together on the edge of his bedstead for he owned
no chairs watching the horses being watered for the night while the
native woman was preparing dinner I did not like being patronized by a
loafer but I was his guest for the time being though he owned only one
very torn alpacacoat and a pair of trousers made out of gunnybags
He took the pipe out of his mouth and went on judiciallyAll things
considered I doubt whether you are the luckier I do not refer to
your extremely limited classical attainments or your excruciating
quantities but to your gross ignorance of matters more immediately
under your notice That for instanceHe pointed to a woman cleaning
a samovar near the well in the centre of the Serai She was flicking the
water out of the spout in regular cadenced jerks

There are ways and ways of cleaning samovars If you knew why she
was doing her work in that particular fashion you would know what the
Spanish Monk meant when he said

 I the Trinity illustrate
 Drinking watered orangepulp
 In three sips the Aryan frustrate
 While he drains his at one gulp

and many other things which now are hidden from your eyes However Mrs
McIntosh has prepared dinner Let us come and eat after the fashion of
the people of the countryof whom by the way you know nothing

The native woman dipped her hand in the dish with us This was wrong
The wife should always wait until the husband has eaten

McIntosh Jellaludin apologized saying

It is an English prejudice which I have not been able to overcome and
she loves me Why I have never been able to understand I foregathered
with her at Jullundur three years ago and she has remained with me
ever since I believe her to be moral and know her to be skilled in
cookery

He patted the womans head as he spoke and she cooed softly She was
not pretty to look at

McIntosh never told me what position he had held before his fall

He was when sober a scholar and a gentleman When drunk he was rather
more of the first than the second He used to get drunk about once a
week for two days On those occasions the native woman tended him
while he raved in all tongues except his own One day indeed he began
reciting Atalanta in Calydon and went through it to the end beating
time to the swing of the verse with a bedsteadleg But he did most of
his ravings in Greek or German The mans mind was a perfect ragbag
of useless things Once when he was beginning to get sober he told
me that I was the only rational being in the Inferno into which he had
descendeda Virgil in the Shades he saidand that in return for
my tobacco he would before he died give me the materials of a new
Inferno that should make me greater than Dante Then he fell asleep on a
horseblanket and woke up quite calm

Man said he when you have reached the uttermost depths of
degradation little incidents which would vex a higher life are to you
of no consequence Last night my soul was among the gods but I make no
doubt that my bestial body was writhing down here in the garbage

You were abominably drunk if thats what you mean I said

I WAS drunkfilthy drunk I who am the son of a man with whom you have
no concernI who was once Fellow of a College whose butteryhatch you
have not seen I was loathsomely drunk But consider how lightly I am
touched It is nothing to me Less than nothing for I do not even feel
the headache which should be my portion Now in a higher life how
ghastly would have been my punishment how bitter my repentance Believe
me my friend with the neglected education the highest is as the
lowestalways supposing each degree extreme

He turned round on the blanket put his head between his fists and
continued

On the Soul which I have lost and on the Conscience which I have
killed I tell you that I CANNOT feel I am as the gods knowing good
and evil but untouched by either Is this enviable or is it not

When a man has lost the warning of next mornings head he must be in
a bad state I answered looking at McIntosh on the blanket with his
hair over his eyes and his lips bluewhite that I did not think the
insensibility good enough

For pitys sake dont say that I tell you it IS good and most
enviable Think of my consolations

Have you so many then McIntosh

Certainly your attempts at sarcasm which is essentially the weapon
of a cultured man are crude First my attainments my classical and
literary knowledge blurred perhaps by immoderate drinkingwhich
reminds me that before my soul went to the Gods last night I sold the
Pickering Horace you so kindly lent me Ditta Mull the Clothesman has
it It fetched ten annas and may be redeemed for a rupeebut still
infinitely superior to yours Secondly the abiding affection of Mrs
McIntosh best of wives Thirdly a monument more enduring than brass
which I have built up in the seven years of my degradation

He stopped here and crawled across the room for a drink of water

He was very shaky and sick

He referred several times to his treasuresome great possession that
he ownedbut I held this to be the raving of drink He was as poor and
as proud as he could be His manner was not pleasant but he knew enough
about the natives among whom seven years of his life had been spent
to make his acquaintance worth having He used actually to laugh at
Strickland as an ignorant manignorant West and Easthe said His
boast was first that he was an Oxford Man of rare and shining parts
which may or may not have been trueI did not know enough to check his
statementsand secondly that he had his hand on the pulse of native
lifewhich was a fact As an Oxford man he struck me as a prig he
was always throwing his education about As a Mahommedan faquiras
McIntosh Jellaludinhe was all that I wanted for my own ends He smoked
several pounds of my tobacco and taught me several ounces of things
worth knowing but he would never accept any gifts not even when the
cold weather came and gripped the poor thin chest under the poor thin
alpacacoat He grew very angry and said that I had insulted him and
that he was not going into hospital He had lived like a beast and he
would die rationally like a man

As a matter of fact he died of pneumonia and on the night of his death
sent over a grubby note asking me to come and help him to die

The native woman was weeping by the side of the bed McIntosh wrapped
in a cotton cloth was too weak to resent a fur coat being thrown over
him He was very active as far as his mind was concerned and his eyes
were blazing When he had abused the Doctor who came with me so foully
that the indignant old fellow left he cursed me for a few minutes and
calmed down

Then he told his wife to fetch out The Book from a hole in the wall
She brought out a big bundle wrapped in the tail of a petticoat of old
sheets of miscellaneous notepaper all numbered and covered with fine
cramped writing McIntosh ploughed his hand through the rubbish and
stirred it up lovingly

This he said is my workthe Book of McIntosh Jellaludin showing
what he saw and how he lived and what befell him and others being also
an account of the life and sins and death of Mother Maturin What Mirza
Murad Ali Begs book is to all other books on native life will my work
be to Mirza Murad Ali Begs

This as will be conceded by any one who knows Mirza Ali Begs book was
a sweeping statement The papers did not look specially valuable but
McIntosh handled them as if they were currencynotes

Then he said slowlyIn despite the many weaknesses of your education
you have been good to me I will speak of your tobacco when I reach the
Gods I owe you much thanks for many kindnesses

But I abominate indebtedness For this reason I bequeath to you now the
monument more enduring than brassmy one bookrude and imperfect in
parts but oh how rare in others I wonder if you will understand it
It is a gift more honorable than Bah where is my brain rambling
to You will mutilate it horribly You will knock out the gems you call
Latin quotations you Philistine and you will butcher the style to
carve into your own jerky jargon but you cannot destroy the whole of
it I bequeath it to you

Ethel My brain again Mrs McIntosh bear witness that I give
the sahib all these papers They would be of no use to you Heart of my
heart and I lay it upon you he turned to me here that you do not
let my book die in its present form It is yours unconditionallythe
story of McIntosh Jellaludin which is NOT the story of McIntosh
Jellaludin but of a greater man than he and of a far greater woman
Listen now I am neither mad nor drunk That book will make you famous

I said thank you as the native woman put the bundle into my arms

My only baby said McIntosh with a smile He was sinking fast but
he continued to talk as long as breath remained I waited for the
end knowing that in six cases out of ten the dying man calls for his
mother He turned on his side and said

Say how it came into your possession No one will believe you but my
name at least will live You will treat it brutally I know you will
Some of it must go the public are fools and prudish fools I was their
servant once But do your mangling gentlyvery gently It is a great
work and I have paid for it in seven years damnation

His voice stopped for ten or twelve breaths and then he began mumbling
a prayer of some kind in Greek The native woman cried very bitterly
Lastly he rose in bed and said as loudly as slowlyNot guilty my
Lord

Then he fell back and the stupor held him till he died The native
woman ran into the Serai among the horses and screamed and beat her
breasts for she had loved him

Perhaps his last sentence in life told what McIntosh had once gone
through but saving the big bundle of old sheets in the cloth there
was nothing in his room to say who or what he had been

The papers were in a hopeless muddle

Strickland helped me to sort them and he said that the writer was
either an extreme liar or a most wonderful person He thought the
former One of these days you may be able to judge for yourself

The bundle needed much expurgation and was full of Greek nonsense at
the head of the chapters which has all been cut out

If the things are ever published some one may perhaps remember this
story now printed as a safeguard to prove that McIntosh Jellaludin and
not I myself wrote the Book of Mother Maturin

I dont want the Giants Robe to come true in my case





VOLUME VI THE LIGHT THAT FAILED




THE LIGHT THAT FAILED



CHAPTER I

 So we settled it all when the storm was done
 As comfy as comfy could be
 And I was to wait in the barn my dears
 Because I was only three
 And Teddy would run to the rainbows foot
 Because he was five and a man
 And thats how it all began my dears
 And thats how it all began
 Big Barn Stories

WHAT do you think shed do if she caught us We oughtnt to have it
you know said Maisie

Beat me and lock you up in your bedroom Dick answered without
hesitation Have you got the cartridges

Yes theyre in my pocket but they are joggling horribly Do pinfire
cartridges go off of their own accord

Dont know Take the revolver if you are afraid and let me carry
them

Im not afraid Maisie strode forward swiftly a hand in her pocket
and her chin in the air Dick followed with a small pinfire revolver

The children had discovered that their lives would be unendurable
without pistolpractice After much forethought and selfdenial Dick
had saved seven shillings and sixpence the price of a badly constructed
Belgian revolver Maisie could only contribute half a crown to the
syndicate for the purchase of a hundred cartridges You can save better
than I can Dick she explained I like nice things to eat and it
doesnt matter to you Besides boys ought to do these things

Dick grumbled a little at the arrangement but went out and made the
purchase which the children were then on their way to test Revolvers
did not lie in the scheme of their daily life as decreed for them by the
guardian who was incorrectly supposed to stand in the place of a mother
to these two orphans Dick had been under her care for six years during
which time she had made her profit of the allowances supposed to be
expended on his clothes and partly through thoughtlessness partly
through a natural desire to painshe was a widow of some years anxious
to marry againhad made his days burdensome on his young shoulders

Where he had looked for love she gave him first aversion and then hate

Where he growing older had sought a little sympathy she gave him
ridicule The many hours that she could spare from the ordering of her
small house she devoted to what she called the hometraining of Dick
Heldar Her religion manufactured in the main by her own intelligence
and a keen study of the Scriptures was an aid to her in this matter At
such times as she herself was not personally displeased with Dick she
left him to understand that he had a heavy account to settle with his
Creator wherefore Dick learned to loathe his God as intensely as he
loathed Mrs Jennett and this is not a wholesome frame of mind for the
young Since she chose to regard him as a hopeless liar when dread of
pain drove him to his first untruth he naturally developed into a liar
but an economical and selfcontained one never throwing away the least
unnecessary fib and never hesitating at the blackest were it only
plausible that might make his life a little easier The treatment
taught him at least the power of living alonea power that was of
service to him when he went to a public school and the boys laughed at
his clothes which were poor in quality and much mended In the holidays
he returned to the teachings of Mrs Jennett and that the chain of
discipline might not be weakened by association with the world was
generally beaten on one account or another before he had been twelve
hours under her roof

The autumn of one year brought him a companion in bondage a
longhaired grayeyed little atom as selfcontained as himself who
moved about the house silently and for the first few weeks spoke only
to the goat that was her chiefest friend on earth and lived in the
backgarden Mrs Jennett objected to the goat on the grounds that
he was unChristianwhich he certainly was Then said the
atom choosing her words very deliberately I shall write to my
lawyerpeoples and tell them that you are a very bad woman Amomma
is mine mine mine Mrs Jennett made a movement to the hall where
certain umbrellas and canes stood in a rack The atom understood as
clearly as Dick what this meant I have been beaten before she said
still in the same passionless voice I have been beaten worse than you
can ever beat me If you beat me I shall write to my lawyerpeoples
and tell them that you do not give me enough to eat I am not afraid of
you Mrs Jennett did not go into the hall and the atom after a pause
to assure herself that all danger of war was past went out to weep
bitterly on Amommas neck

Dick learned to know her as Maisie and at first mistrusted her
profoundly for he feared that she might interfere with the small
liberty of action left to him She did not however and she volunteered
no friendliness until Dick had taken the first steps Long before the
holidays were over the stress of punishment shared in common drove the
children together if it were only to play into each others hands as
they prepared lies for Mrs Jennetts use When Dick returned to school
Maisie whispered Now I shall be all alone to take care of myself
but and she nodded her head bravely I can do it You promised to
send Amomma a grass collar Send it soon A week later she asked for
that collar by return of post and was not pleased when she learned that
it took time to make When at last Dick forwarded the gift she forgot
to thank him for it

Many holidays had come and gone since that day and Dick had grown into
a lanky hobbledehoy more than ever conscious of his bad clothes Not
for a moment had Mrs Jennett relaxed her tender care of him but the
average canings of a public schoolDick fell under punishment about
three times a monthfilled him with contempt for her powers She
doesnt hurt he explained to Maisie who urged him to rebellion and
she is kinder to you after she has whacked me Dick shambled through
the days unkempt in body and savage in soul as the smaller boys of the
school learned to know for when the spirit moved him he would hit them
cunningly and with science The same spirit made him more than once try
to tease Maisie but the girl refused to be made unhappy We are both
miserable as it is said she What is the use of trying to make things
worse Lets find things to do and forget things

The pistol was the outcome of that search It could only be used on the
muddiest foreshore of the beach far away from the bathingmachines and
pierheads below the grassy slopes of Fort Keeling The tide ran out
nearly two miles on that coast and the manycoloured mudbanks touched
by the sun sent up a lamentable smell of dead weed It was late in the
afternoon when Dick and Maisie arrived on their ground Amomma trotting
patiently behind them

Mf said Maisie sniffing the air I wonder what makes the sea so
smelly I dontlike it

You never like anything that isnt made just for you said Dick
bluntly Give me the cartridges and Ill try first shot How far does
one of these little revolvers carry

Oh half a mile said Maisie promptly At least it makes an awful
noise Be careful with the cartridges I dont like those jagged
stickup things on the rim Dick do be careful

All right I know how to load Ill fire at the breakwater out there

He fired and Amomma ran away bleating The bullet threw up a spurt of
mud to the right of the woodwreathed piles

Throws high and to the right You try Maisie Mind its loaded all
round

Maisie took the pistol and stepped delicately to the verge of the mud
her hand firmly closed on the butt her mouth and left eye screwed up

Dick sat down on a tuft of bank and laughed Amomma returned very
cautiously He was accustomed to strange experiences in his afternoon
walks and finding the cartridgebox unguarded made investigations
with his nose Maisie fired but could not see where the bullet went

I think it hit the post she said shading her eyes and looking out
across the sailless sea

I know it has gone out to the Marazion Bellbuoy said Dick with a
chuckle Fire low and to the left then perhaps youll get it Oh look
at Amommahes eating the cartridges

Maisie turned the revolver in her hand just in time to see Amomma
scampering away from the pebbles Dick threw after him Nothing is sacred
to a billygoat Being well fed and the adored of his mistress Amomma
had naturally swallowed two loaded pinfire cartridges Maisie hurried
up to assure herself that Dick had not miscounted the tale

Yes hes eaten two

Horrid little beast Then theyll joggle about inside him and blow up
and serve him right Oh Dick have I killed you

Revolvers are tricky things for young hands to deal with Maisie could
not explain how it had happened but a veil of reeking smoke separated
her from Dick and she was quite certain that the pistol had gone off in
his face Then she heard him sputter and dropped on her knees beside
him crying Dick you arent hurt are you I didnt mean it

Of course you didnt said Dick coming out of the smoke and wiping his
cheek But you nearly blinded me That powder stuff stings awfully
A neat little splash of gray led on a stone showed where the bullet had
gone Maisie began to whimper

Dont said Dick jumping to his feet and shaking himself Im not a
bit hurt

No but I might have killed you protested Maisie the corners of her
mouth drooping What should I have done then

Gone home and told Mrs Jennett Dick grinned at the thought then
softening Please dont worry about it Besides we are wasting time
Weve got to get back to tea Ill take the revolver for a bit

Maisie would have wept on the least encouragement but Dicks
indifference albeit his hand was shaking as he picked up the pistol
restrained her She lay panting on the beach while Dick methodically
bombarded the breakwater Got it at last he exclaimed as a lock of
weed flew from the wood

Let me try said Maisie imperiously Im all right now

They fired in turns till the rickety little revolver nearly shook itself
to pieces and Amomma the outcastbecause he might blow up at any
momentbrowsed in the background and wondered why stones were thrown
at him Then they found a balk of timber floating in a pool which
was commanded by the seaward slope of Fort Keeling and they sat down
together before this new target

Next holidays said Dick as the now thoroughly fouled revolver kicked
wildly in his hand well get another pistolcentral firethat will
carry farther

There wont be any next holidays for me said Maisie Im going away

Where to

I dont know My lawyers have written to Mrs Jennett and Ive got to
be educated somewherein France perhapsI dontknow where but I
shall be glad to go away

I shant like it a bit I suppose I shall be left Look here Maisie
is it really true youre going Then these holidays will be the last I
shall see anything of you and I go back to school next week I wish

The young blood turned his cheeks scarlet Maisie was picking
grasstufts and throwing them down the slope at a yellow seapoppy
nodding all by itself to the illimitable levels of the mudflats and the
milkwhite sea beyond

I wish she said after a pause that I could see you again sometime
You wish that too

Yes but it would have been better ififyou hadshot straight over
theredown by the breakwater

Maisie looked with large eyes for a moment And this was the boy
who only ten days before had decorated Amommas horns with cutpaper
hamfrills and turned him out a bearded derision among the public
ways Then she dropped her eyes this was not the boy

Dont be stupid she said reprovingly and with swift instinct
attacked the sideissue How selfish you are Just think what I should
have felt if that horrid thing had killed you Im quite miserable
enough already

Why Because youre going away from Mrs Jennett

No

From me then

No answer for a long time Dick dared not look at her He felt though
he did not know all that the past four years had been to him and this
the more acutely since he had no knowledge to put his feelings in words

I dont know she said I suppose it is

Maisie you must know Im not supposing

Lets go home said Maisie weakly

But Dick was not minded to retreat

I cant say things he pleaded and Im awfully sorry for teasing you
about Amomma the other day Its all different now Maisie cant you
see And you might have told me that you were going instead of leaving
me to find out

You didnt I did tell Oh Dick whats the use of worrying

There isnt any but weve been together years and years and I didnt
know how much I cared

I dont believe you ever did care

No I didnt but I doI care awfully now Maisie he gulpedMaisie
darling say you care too please

I do indeed I do but it wont be any use

Why

Because I am going away

Yes but if you promise before you go Only saywill you A second
darling came to his lips more easily than the first There were
few endearments in Dicks home or school life he had to find them by
instinct Dick caught the little hand blackened with the escaped gas of
the revolver

I promise she said solemnly but if I care there is no need for
promising

And do you care For the first time in the past few minutes their eyes
met and spoke for them who had no skill in speech

Oh Dick dont Please dont It was all right when we said
goodmorning but now its all different Amomma looked on from afar

He had seen his property quarrel frequently but he had never seen
kisses exchanged before The yellow seapoppy was wiser and nodded its
head approvingly Considered as a kiss that was a failure but since it
was the first other than those demanded by duty in all the world that
either had ever given or taken it opened to them new worlds and every
one of them glorious so that they were lifted above the consideration
of any worlds at all especially those in which tea is necessary and
sat still holding each others hands and saying not a word

You cant forget now said Dick at last There was that on his cheek
that stung more than gunpowder

I shouldnt have forgotten anyhow said Maisie and they looked at
each other and saw that each was changed from the companion of an hour
ago to a wonder and a mystery they could not understand The sun began
to set and a nightwind thrashed along the bents of the foreshore

We shall be awfully late for tea said Maisie Lets go home

Lets use the rest of the cartridges first said Dick and he helped
Maisie down the slope of the fort to the seaa descent that she was
quite capable of covering at full speed Equally gravely Maisie took the
grimy hand Dick bent forward clumsily Maisie drew the hand away and
Dick blushed

Its very pretty he said

Pooh said Maisie with a little laugh of gratified vanity She stood
close to Dick as he loaded the revolver for the last time and fired
over the sea with a vague notion at the back of his head that he was
protecting Maisie from all the evils in the world A puddle far across
the mud caught the last rays of the sun and turned into a wrathful red
disc The light held Dicks attention for a moment and as he raised his
revolver there fell upon him a renewed sense of the miraculous in
that he was standing by Maisie who had promised to care for him for an
indefinite length of time till such date asA gust of the growing
wind drove the girls long black hair across his face as she stood with
her hand on his shoulder calling Amomma a little beast and for a
moment he was in the darka darkness that stung The bullet went
singing out to the empty sea

Spoilt my aim said he shaking his head There arent any more
cartridges we shall have to run home But they did not run They
walked very slowly arm in arm And it was a matter of indifference to
them whether the neglected Amomma with two pinfire cartridges in his
inside blew up or trotted beside them for they had come into a golden
heritage and were disposing of it with all the wisdom of all their
years

And I shall be quoth Dick valiantly Then he checked himself I
dont know what I shall be I dont seem to be able to pass any exams
but I can make awful caricatures of the masters Ho Ho

Be an artist then said Maisie Youre always laughing at my trying
to draw and it will do you good

Ill never laugh at anything you do he answered Ill be an artist
and Ill do things

Artists always want money dontthey

Ive got a hundred and twenty pounds a year of my own My guardians
tell me Im to have it when I come of age That will be enough to begin
with

Ah Im rich said Maisie Ive got three hundred a year all my own
when Im twentyone Thats why Mrs Jennett is kinder to me than she is
to you I wish though that I had somebody that belonged to mejust a
father or a mother

You belong to me said Dick for ever and ever

Yes we belongfor ever Its very nice She squeezed his arm The
kindly darkness hid them both and emboldened because he could only
just see the profile of Maisies cheek with the long lashes veiling the
gray eyes Dick at the front door delivered himself of the words he had
been boggling over for the last two hours

And Ilove you Maisie he said in a whisper that seemed to him to
ring across the worldthe world that he would tomorrow or the next day
set out to conquer

There was a scene not for the sake of discipline to be reported
when Mrs Jennett would have fallen upon him first for disgraceful
unpunctuality and secondly for nearly killing himself with a forbidden
weapon

I was playing with it and it went off by itself said Dick when the
powderpocked cheek could no longer be hidden but if you think youre
going to lick me youre wrong You are never going to touch me again
Sit down and give me my tea You cant cheat us out of that anyhow

Mrs Jennett gasped and became livid Maisie said nothing but
encouraged Dick with her eyes and he behaved abominably all that
evening Mrs Jennett prophesied an immediate judgment of Providence and
a descent into Tophet later but Dick walked in Paradise and would not
hear Only when he was going to bed Mrs Jennett recovered and asserted
herself He had bidden Maisie good night with downdropped eyes and from
a distance

If you arent a gentleman you might try to behave like one said Mrs
Jennett spitefully Youve been quarrelling with Maisie again

This meant that the usual goodnight kiss had been omitted Maisie
white to the lips thrust her cheek forward with a fine air of
indifference and was duly pecked by Dick who tramped out of the room
red as fire That night he dreamed a wild dream He had won all the
world and brought it to Maisie in a cartridgebox but she turned it
over with her foot and instead of saying Thank you criedWhere is
the grass collar you promised for Amomma Oh how selfish you are

IM NOT angry with the British public but I wish we had a few thousand

that lotfrizzling on hot gravel

With a blue veil over his head and his clothes in strips Has any man

Why not six square acres while youre about it But lend me the
needle and Ill see what I can do with the selvage I dont think
theres enough to protect my royal body from the cold blast as it is
What are you doing with that everlasting sketchbook of yours Dick

Study of our Special Correspondent repairing his wardrobe said
Dick gravely as the other man kicked off a pair of sorely worn
ridingbreeches and began to fit a square of coarse canvas over the most
obvious open space He grunted disconsolately as the vastness of the
void developed itself

Sugarbags indeed Hi you pilot man there lend me all the sails for
that whaleboat

A fezcrowned head bobbed up in the sternsheets divided itself into
exact halves with one flashing grin and bobbed down again The man of
the tattered breeches clad only in a Norfolk jacket and a gray flannel
shirt went on with his clumsy sewing while Dick chuckled over the
sketch

Some twenty whaleboats were nuzzling a sandbank which was dotted
with English soldiery of half a dozen corps bathing or washing their
clothes A heap of boatrollers commissariatboxes sugarbags
and flourand smallarmammunitioncases showed where one of the
whaleboats had been compelled to unload hastily and a regimental
carpenter was swearing aloud as he tried on a wholly insufficient
allowance of white lead to plaster up the sunparched gaping seams of
the boat herself

First the bloomin rudder snaps said he to the world in general
then the mast goes an then s help me when she cant do nothin
else she opens erself out like a cockeyed Chinese lotus

Exactly the case with my breeches whoever you are said the tailor
without looking up Dick I wonder when I shall see a decent shop
again

There was no answer save the incessant angry murmur of the Nile as it
raced round a basaltwalled bend and foamed across a rockridge half
a mile upstream It was as though the brown weight of the river would
drive the white men back to their own country The indescribable scent
of Nile mud in the air told that the stream was falling and the next
few miles would be no light thing for the whaleboats to overpass The
desert ran down almost to the banks where among gray red and black
hillocks a camelcorps was encamped No man dared even for a day lose
touch of the slowmoving boats there had been no fighting for weeks
past and throughout all that time the Nile had never spared them Rapid
had followed rapid rock rock and islandgroup islandgroup till the
rank and file had long since lost all count of direction and very
nearly of time They were moving somewhere they did not know why to do
something they did not know what Before them lay the Nile and at the
other end of it was one Gordon fighting for the dear life in a town
called Khartoum There were columns of British troops in the desert
or in one of the many deserts there were yet more columns waiting to
embark on the river there were fresh drafts waiting at Assioot and
Assuan there were lies and rumours running over the face of the
hopeless land from Suakin to the Sixth Cataract and men supposed
generally that there must be some one in authority to direct the general
scheme of the many movements The duty of that particular rivercolumn
was to keep the whaleboats afloat in the water to avoid trampling
on the villagers crops when the gangs tracked the boats with lines
thrown from midstream to get as much sleep and food as was possible
and above all to press on without delay in the teeth of the churning
Nile

With the soldiers sweated and toiled the correspondents of the
newspapers and they were almost as ignorant as their companions But
it was above all things necessary that England at breakfast should be
amused and thrilled and interested whether Gordon lived or died or
half the British army went to pieces in the sands The Soudan campaign
was a picturesque one and lent itself to vivid wordpainting Now and
again a Special managed to get slainwhich was not altogether
a disadvantage to the paper that employed himand more often the
handtohand nature of the fighting allowed of miraculous escapes which
were worth telegraphing home at eighteenpence the word There were many
correspondents with many corps and columnsfrom the veterans who had
followed on the heels of the cavalry that occupied Cairo in 82 what
time Arabi Pasha called himself king who had seen the first miserable
work round Suakin when the sentries were cut up nightly and the scrub
swarmed with spears to youngsters jerked into the business at the
end of a telegraphwire to take the places of their betters killed or
invalided

Among the seniorsthose who knew every shift and change in the
perplexing postal arrangements the value of the seediest weediest
Egyptian garron offered for sale in Cairo or Alexandria who could talk
a telegraphclerk into amiability and soothe the ruffled vanity of
a newly appointed staffofficer when press regulations became
burdensomewas the man in the flannel shirt the blackbrowed
Torpenhow He represented the Central Southern Syndicate in the
campaign as he had represented it in the Egyptian war and elsewhere
The syndicate did not concern itself greatly with criticisms of
attack and the like It supplied the masses and all it demanded was
picturesqueness and abundance of detail for there is more joy in
England over a soldier who insubordinately steps out of square to rescue
a comrade than over twenty generals slaving even to baldness at the
gross details of transport and commissariat

He had met at Suakin a young man sitting on the edge of a recently
abandoned redoubt about the size of a hatbox sketching a clump of
shelltorn bodies on the gravel plain

What are you for said Torpenhow The greeting of the correspondent is
that of the commercial traveller on the road

My own hand said the young man without looking up Have you any
tobacco

Torpenhow waited till the sketch was finished and when he had looked at
it said Whats your business here

Nothing there was a row so I came Im supposed to be doing something
down at the paintingslips among the boats or else Im in charge of the
condenser on one of the waterships Ive forgotten which

Youve cheek enough to build a redoubt with said Torpenhow and took
stock of the new acquaintance Do you always draw like that

The young man produced more sketches Row on a Chinese pigboat said
he sententiously showing them one after anotherChief mate dirked

Hm said Torpenhow cantsay I care for Verestchaginandwater
myself but theres no accounting for tastes Doing anything now are
you

No Im amusing myself here

Torpenhow looked at the sketches again and nodded Yes youre right
to take your first chance when you can get it

He rode away swiftly through the Gate of the Two WarShips rattled
across the causeway into the town and wired to his syndicate Got man
here picturework Good and cheap Shall I arrange Will do letterpress
with sketches

The man on the redoubt sat swinging his legs and murmuring I knew the
chance would come sooner or later By Gad theyll have to sweat for it
if I come through this business alive

In the evening Torpenhow was able to announce to his friend that
the Central Southern Agency was willing to take him on trial paying
expenses for three months And by the way whats your name said
Torpenhow

Heldar Do they give me a free hand

Theyve taken you on chance You must justify the choice Youd better
stick to me Im going upcountry with a column and Ill do what I can
for you Give me some of your sketches taken here and Ill send
em along To himself he said Thats the best bargain the Central
Southern has ever made and they got me cheaply enough

So it came to pass that after some purchase of horseflesh and
arrangements financial and political Dick was made free of the New
and Honourable Fraternity of war correspondents who all possess the
inalienable right of doing as much work as they can and getting as much
for it as Providence and their owners shall please To these things are
added in time if the brother be worthy the power of glib speech that
neither man nor woman can resist when a meal or a bed is in question
the eye of a horsecope the skill of a cook the constitution of a
bullock the digestion of an ostrich and an infinite adaptability to
all circumstances But many die before they attain to this degree and
the pastmasters in the craft appear for the most part in dressclothes
when they are in England and thus their glory is hidden from the
multitude

Dick followed Torpenhow wherever the latters fancy chose to lead him
and between the two they managed to accomplish some work that almost
satisfied themselves It was not an easy life in any way and under its
influence the two were drawn very closely together for they ate from
the same dish they shared the same waterbottle and most binding tie
of all their mails went off together It was Dick who managed to make
gloriously drunk a telegraphclerk in a palm hut far beyond the Second
Cataract and while the man lay in bliss on the floor possessed
himself of some laboriously acquired exclusive information forwarded
by a confiding correspondent of an opposition syndicate made a careful
duplicate of the matter and brought the result to Torpenhow who said
that all was fair in love or war correspondence and built an excellent
descriptive article from his rivals riotous waste of words It was
Torpenhow whobut the tale of their adventures together and apart
from Philae to the waste wilderness of Herawi and Muella would fill
many books They had been penned into a square side by side in deadly
fear of being shot by overexcited soldiers they had fought with
baggagecamels in the chill dawn they had jogged along in silence
under blinding sun on indefatigable little Egyptian horses and they had
floundered on the shallows of the Nile when the whaleboat in which
they had found a berth chose to hit a hidden rock and rip out half her
bottomplanks

Now they were sitting on the sandbank and the whaleboats were
bringing up the remainder of the column

Yes said Torpenhow as he put the last rude stitches into his
overlongneglected gear it has been a beautiful business

The patch or the campaign said Dick Dont think much of either
myself

You want the Euryalus brought up above the Third Cataract dont you
and eightyoneton guns at Jakdul Now Im quite satisfied with my
breeches He turned round gravely to exhibit himself after the manner
of a clown

Its very pretty Specially the lettering on the sack GBT
Government Bullock Train Thats a sack from India

Its my initialsGilbert Belling Torpenhow I stole the cloth on
purpose What the mischief are the camelcorps doing yonder Torpenhow
shaded his eyes and looked across the scrubstrewn gravel

A bugle blew furiously and the men on the bank hurried to their arms
and accoutrements

Pisan soldiery surprised while bathing remarked Dick calmly

Dyou remember the picture Its by Michael Angelo all beginners copy
it That scrubs alive with enemy

The camelcorps on the bank yelled to the infantry to come to them and
a hoarse shouting down the river showed that the remainder of the
column had wind of the trouble and was hastening to take share in it
As swiftly as a reach of still water is crisped by the wind the
rockstrewn ridges and scrubtopped hills were troubled and alive with
armed men

Mercifully it occurred to these to stand far off for a time to shout
and gesticulate joyously One man even delivered himself of a long
story The camelcorps did not fire They were only too glad of a little
breathingspace until some sort of square could be formed The men on
the sandbank ran to their side and the whaleboats as they toiled up
within shouting distance were thrust into the nearest bank and emptied
of all save the sick and a few men to guard them The Arab orator ceased
his outcries and his friends howled

They look like the Mahdis men said Torpenhow elbowing himself
into the crush of the square but what thousands of em there are The
tribes hereabout arent against us I know

Then the Mahdis taken another town said Dick and set all these
yelping devils free to show us up Lend us your glass

Our scouts should have told us of this Weve been trapped said a
subaltern Arent the camel guns ever going to begin Hurry up you
men

There was no need of any order The men flung themselves panting against
the sides of the square for they had good reason to know that whoso
was left outside when the fighting began would very probably die in
an extremely unpleasant fashion The little hundredandfiftypound
camelguns posted at one corner of the square opened the ball as the
square moved forward by its right to get possession of a knoll of rising
ground All had fought in this manner many times before and there
was no novelty in the entertainment always the same hot and stifling
formation the smell of dust and leather the same boltlike rush of
the enemy the same pressure on the weakest side the few minutes of
handtohand scuffle and then the silence of the desert broken only
by the yells of those whom their handful of cavalry attempted to purse
They had become careless The camelguns spoke at intervals and the
square slouched forward amid the protesting of the camels Then came the
attack of three thousand men who had not learned from books that it is
impossible for troops in close order to attack against breechloading
fire

A few dropping shots heralded their approach and a few horsemen led
but the bulk of the force was naked humanity mad with rage and armed
with the spear and the sword The instinct of the desert where there
is always much war told them that the right flank of the square was the
weakest for they swung clear of the front The camelguns shelled them
as they passed and opened for an instant lanes through their midst most
like those quickclosing vistas in a Kentish hopgarden seen when the
train races by at full speed and the infantry fire held till the
opportune moment dropped them in closepacking hundreds No civilised
troops in the world could have endured the hell through which they came
the living leaping high to avoid the dying who clutched at their heels
the wounded cursing and staggering forward till they fella torrent
black as the sliding water above a milldamfull on the right flank of
the square

Then the line of the dusty troops and the faint blue desert sky overhead
went out in rolling smoke and the little stones on the heated ground
and the tinderdry clumps of scrub became matters of surpassing
interest for men measured their agonised retreat and recovery by these
things counting mechanically and hewing their way back to chosen pebble
and branch There was no semblance of any concerted fighting For aught
the men knew the enemy might be attempting all four sides of the square
at once Their business was to destroy what lay in front of them to
bayonet in the back those who passed over them and dying to drag
down the slayer till he could be knocked on the head by some avenging
gunbutt

Dick waited with Torpenhow and a young doctor till the stress grew
unendurable It was hopeless to attend to the wounded till the attack
was repulsed so the three moved forward gingerly towards the weakest
side of the square There was a rush from without the short houghhough
of the stabbing spears and a man on a horse followed by thirty or
forty others dashed through yelling and hacking The right flank of
the square sucked in after them and the other sides sent help The
wounded who knew that they had but a few hours more to live caught at
the enemys feet and brought them down or staggering into a discarded
rifle fired blindly into the scuffle that raged in the centre of the
square

Dick was conscious that somebody had cut him violently across his
helmet that he had fired his revolver into a black foamflecked face
which forthwith ceased to bear any resemblance to a face and that
Torpenhow had gone down under an Arab whom he had tried to collar low
and was turning over and over with his captive feeling for the mans
eyes The doctor jabbed at a venture with a bayonet and a helmetless
soldier fired over Dicks shoulder the flying grains of powder stung
his cheek It was to Torpenhow that Dick turned by instinct The
representative of the Central Southern Syndicate had shaken himself
clear of his enemy and rose wiping his thumb on his trousers The
Arab both hands to his forehead screamed aloud then snatched up his
spear and rushed at Torpenhow who was panting under shelter of Dicks
revolver Dick fired twice and the man dropped limply His upturned
face lacked one eye The musketryfire redoubled but cheers mingled
with it The rush had failed and the enemy were flying If the heart of
the square were shambles the ground beyond was a butchers shop Dick
thrust his way forward between the maddened men The remnant of the
enemy were retiring as the fewthe very fewEnglish cavalry rode down
the laggards

Beyond the lines of the dead a broad bloodstained Arab spear cast
aside in the retreat lay across a stump of scrub and beyond this again
the illimitable dark levels of the desert The sun caught the steel
and turned it into a red disc Some one behind him was saying Ah
get away you brute Dick raised his revolver and pointed towards the
desert His eye was held by the red splash in the distance and the
clamour about him seemed to die down to a very faraway whisper like
the whisper of a level sea There was the revolver and the red light
 and the voice of some one scaring something away exactly as had
fallen somewhere beforea darkness that stung He fired at random and
the bullet went out across the desert as he muttered Spoilt my aim
There arent any more cartridges We shall have to run home He put his
hand to his head and brought it away covered with blood

Old man youre cut rather badly said Torpenhow I owe you something
for this business Thanks Stand up I say you cant be ill here

Throughout the night when the troops were encamped by the whaleboats
a black figure danced in the strong moonlight on the sandbar and
shouted that Khartoum the accursed one was deadwas deadwas
deadthat two steamers were rockstaked on the Nile outside the city
and that of all their crews there remained not one and Khartoum was
deadwas deadwas dead But Torpenhow took no heed He was watching
Dick who called aloud to the restless Nile for Maisieand again
Maisie Behold a phenomenon said Torpenhow rearranging the blanket
Here is a man presumably human who mentions the name of one woman
only And Ive seen a good deal of delirium tooDick heres some
fizzy drink

Thank you Maisie said Dick



CHAPTER III

 So he thinks he shall take to the sea again
 For one more cruise with his buccaneers
 To singe the beard of the King of Spain
 And capture another Dean of Jaen
 And sell him in Algiers
 Dutch Picture Longfellow

THE SOUDAN campaign and Dicks broken head had been some months ended
and mended and the Central Southern Syndicate had paid Dick a certain
sum on account for work done which work they were careful to assure him
was not altogether up to their standard Dick heaved the letter into
the Nile at Cairo cashed the draft in the same town and bade a warm
farewell to Torpenhow at the station

I am going to lie up for a while and rest said Torpenhow I dont
know where I shall live in London but if God brings us to meet we
shall meet Are you staying here on the offchance of another row There
will be none till the Southern Soudan is reoccupied by our troops Mark
that Goodbye bless you come back when your moneys spent and give me
your address

Dick loitered in Cairo Alexandria Ismailia and Port Saidespecially
Port Said There is iniquity in many parts of the world and vice in
all but the concentrated essence of all the iniquities and all the
vices in all the continents finds itself at Port Said And through the
heart of that sandbordered hell where the mirage flickers day long
above the Bitter Lake move if you will only wait most of the men and
women you have known in this life Dick established himself in quarters
more riotous than respectable He spent his evenings on the quay and
boarded many ships and saw very many friendsgracious Englishwomen
with whom he had talked not too wisely in the veranda of Shepherds
Hotel hurrying war correspondents skippers of the contract troopships
employed in the campaign army officers by the score and others of less
reputable trades

He had choice of all the races of the East and West for studies and
the advantage of seeing his subjects under the influence of strong
excitement at the gamingtables saloons dancinghells and elsewhere
For recreation there was the straight vista of the Canal the blazing
sands the procession of shipping and the white hospitals where the
English soldiers lay He strove to set down in black and white and
colour all that Providence sent him and when that supply was ended
sought about for fresh material It was a fascinating employment but
it ran away with his money and he had drawn in advance the hundred and
twenty pounds to which he was entitled yearly Now I shall have to work
and starve thought he and was addressing himself to this new fate
when a mysterious telegram arrived from Torpenhow in England which
said Come back quick you have caught on Come

A large smile overspread his face So soon thats a good hearing
said he to himself There will be an orgy tonight Ill stand or fall
by my luck Faith its time it came He deposited half of his funds
in the hands of his wellknown friends Monsieur and Madame Binat and
ordered himself a Zanzibar dance of the finest Monsieur Binat was
shaking with drink but Madame smiles sympatheticallyMonsieur needs
a chair of course and of course Monsieur will sketch Monsieur amuses
himself strangely

Binat raised a bluewhite face from a cot in the inner room I
understand he quavered We all know Monsieur Monsieur is an artist
as I have been Dick nodded In the end said Binat with gravity
Monsieur will descend alive into hell as I have descended And he
laughed

You must come to the dance too said Dick I shall want you

For my face I knew it would be so For my face My God and for my
degradation so tremendous I will not Take him away He is a devil
Or at least do thou Celeste demand of him more The excellent Binat
began to kick and scream

All things are for sale in Port Said said Madame If my husband
comes it will be so much more Eh how you call alf a sovereign

The money was paid and the mad dance was held at night in a walled courtyard
at the back of Madame Binats house The lady herself in faded mauve
silk always about to slide from her yellow shoulders played the piano
and to the tinpot music of a Western waltz the naked Zanzibari girls
danced furiously by the light of kerosene lamps Binat sat upon a chair
and stared with eyes that saw nothing till the whirl of the dance and
the clang of the rattling piano stole into the drink that took the place
of blood in his veins and his face glistened Dick took him by the chin
brutally and turned that face to the light Madame Binat looked over her
shoulder and smiled with many teeth Dick leaned against the wall and
sketched for an hour till the kerosene lamps began to smell and the
girls threw themselves panting on the hardbeaten ground Then he shut
his book with a snap and moved away Binat plucking feebly at his elbow
Show me he whimpered I too was once an artist even I Dick showed
him the rough sketch Am I that he screamed Will you take that away
with you and show all the world that it is IBinat He moaned and
wept

Monsieur has paid for all said Madame To the pleasure of seeing
Monsieur again

The courtyard gate shut and Dick hurried up the sandy street to the
nearest gamblinghell where he was well known If the luck holds its
an omen if I lose I must stay here He placed his money picturesquely
about the board hardly daring to look at what he did The luck held

Three turns of the wheel left him richer by twenty pounds and he went
down to the shipping to make friends with the captain of a decayed
cargosteamer who landed him in London with fewer pounds in his pocket
than he cared to think about

A thin gray fog hung over the city and the streets were very cold for
summer was in England

Its a cheerful wilderness and it hasnt the knack of altering much
Dick thought as he tramped from the Docks westward Now what must I
do

The packed houses gave no answer Dick looked down the long lightless
streets and at the appalling rush of traffic Oh you rabbithutches
said he addressing a row of highly respectable semidetached
residences Do you know what youve got to do later on You have to
supply me with menservants and maidservantshere he smacked his
lipsand the peculiar treasure of kings Meantime Ill clothes and
boots and presently I will return and trample on you He stepped
forward energetically he saw that one of his shoes was burst at the
side As he stooped to make investigations a man jostled him into the
gutter All right he said Thats another nick in the score Ill
jostle you later on

Good clothes and boots are not cheap and Dick left his last shop with
the certainty that he would be respectably arrayed for a time but with
only fifty shillings in his pocket He returned to streets by the Docks
and lodged himself in one room where the sheets on the bed were almost
audibly marked in case of theft and where nobody seemed to go to bed at
all When his clothes arrived he sought the Central Southern Syndicate
for Torpenhows address and got it with the intimation that there was
still some money waiting for him

How much said Dick as one who habitually dealt in millions

Between thirty and forty pounds If it would be any convenience to
you of course we could let you have it at once but we usually settle
accounts monthly

If I show that I want anything now Im lost he said to himself All
I need Ill take later on Then aloud Its hardly worth while and
Im going to the country for a month too Wait till I come back and
Ill see about it

But we trust Mr Heldar that you do not intend to sever your
connection with us

 Dicks business in life was the study of faces and he watched the speaker
keenly That man means something he said Ill do no business till
Ive seen Torpenhow Theres a big deal coming So he departed making
no promises to his one little room by the Docks And that day was
the seventh of the month and that month he reckoned with awful
distinctness had thirtyone days in it It is not easy for a man of
catholic tastes and healthy appetites to exist for twentyfour days on
fifty shillings Nor is it cheering to begin the experiment alone in
all the loneliness of London Dick paid seven shillings a week for his
lodging which left him rather less than a shilling a day for food and
drink Naturally his first purchase was of the materials of his craft
he had been without them too long Half a days investigations and
comparison brought him to the conclusion that sausages and mashed
potatoes twopence a plate were the best food Now sausages once or
twice a week for breakfast are not unpleasant As lunch even with
mashed potatoes they become monotonous At dinner they are impertinent
At the end of three days Dick loathed sausages and going forth
pawned his watch to revel on sheeps head which is not as cheap as it
looks owing to the bones and the gravy Then he returned to sausages
and mashed potatoes Then he confined himself entirely to mashed
potatoes for a day and was unhappy because of pain in his inside Then
he pawned his waistcoat and his tie and thought regretfully of money
thrown away in times past There are few things more edifying unto
Art than the actual bellypinch of hunger and Dick in his few walks
abroadhe did not care for exercise it raised desires that could not
be satisfiedfound himself dividing mankind into two classesthose
who looked as if they might give him something to eat and those who
looked otherwise I never knew what I had to learn about the human
face before he thought and as a reward for his humility Providence
caused a cabdriver at a sausageshop where Dick fed that night to leave
half eaten a great chunk of bread Dick took itwould have fought all
the world for its possessionand it cheered him

The month dragged through at last and nearly prancing with impatience
he went to draw his money Then he hastened to Torpenhows address
and smelt the smell of cooking meats all along the corridors of the
chambers Torpenhow was on the top floor and Dick burst into his room
to be received with a hug which nearly cracked his ribs as Torpenhow
dragged him to the light and spoke of twenty different things in the
same breath

But youre looking tucked up he concluded

Got anything to eat said Dick his eye roaming round the room

I shall be having breakfast in a minute What do you say to sausages

No anything but sausages Torp Ive been starving on that accursed
horseflesh for thirty days and thirty nights

Now what lunacy has been your latest

Dick spoke of the last few weeks with unbridled speech Then he opened
his coat there was no waistcoat below I ran it fine awfully fine
but Ive just scraped through

You havent much sense but youve got a backbone anyhow Eat and
talk afterwards Dick fell upon eggs and bacon and gorged till he could
gorge no more Torpenhow handed him a filled pipe and he smoked as men
smoke who for three weeks have been deprived of good tobacco

Ouf said he Thats heavenly Well

Why in the world didnt you come to me

Couldnt I owe you too much already old man Besides I had a sort of
superstition that this temporary starvationthats what it was and it
hurtwould bring me luck later Its over and done with now and none
of the syndicate know how hard up I was Fire away Whats the exact
state of affairs as regards myself

You had my wire Youve caught on here People like your work
immensely I dont know why but they do They say you have a fresh
touch and a new way of drawing things And because theyre chiefly
homebred English they say you have insight Youre wanted by half a
dozen papers youre wanted to illustrate books

Dick grunted scornfully

Youre wanted to work up your smaller sketches and sell them to the
dealers They seem to think the money sunk in you is a good investment
Good Lord who can account for the fathomless folly of the public

Theyre a remarkably sensible people

They are subject to fits if thats what you mean and you happen to be
the object of the latest fit among those who are interested in what
they call Art Just now youre a fashion a phenomenon or whatever you
please I appeared to be the only person who knew anything about you
here and I have been showing the most useful men a few of the sketches
you gave me from time to time Those coming after your work on the
Central Southern Syndicate appear to have done your business Youre in
luck

Huh call it luck Do call it luck when a man has been kicking about
the world like a dog waiting for it to come Ill luck em later on I
want a place to work first

Come here said Torpenhow crossing the landing This place is a big
box room really but it will do for you Theres your skylight or
your north light or whatever window you call it and plenty of room to
thrash about in and a bedroom beyond What more do you need

Good enough said Dick looking round the large room that took up a
third of a top story in the rickety chambers overlooking the Thames A
pale yellow sun shone through the skylight and showed the much dirt of
the place Three steps led from the door to the landing and three
more to Torpenhows room The well of the staircase disappeared into
darkness pricked by tiny gasjets and there were sounds of men talking
and doors slamming seven flights below in the warm gloom

Do they give you a free hand here said Dick cautiously He was
Ishmael enough to know the value of liberty

Anything you like latchkeys and license unlimited We are permanent
tenants for the most part here Tisnt a place I would recommend for a
Young Mens Christian Association but it will serve I took these rooms
for you when I wired

 Youre a great deal too kind old man

You didnt suppose you were going away from me did you Torpenhow put
his hand on Dicks shoulder and the two walked up and down the room
henceforward to be called the studio in sweet and silent communion
They heard rapping at Torpenhows door Thats some ruffian come up
for a drink said Torpenhow and he raised his voice cheerily There
entered no one more ruffianly than a portly middleaged gentleman in
a satinfaced frockcoat His lips were parted and pale and there were
deep pouches under the eyes

Weak heart said Dick to himself and as he shook hands very weak
heart His pulse is shaking his fingers

The man introduced himself as the head of the Central Southern Syndicate
and one of the most ardent admirers of your work Mr Heldar I assure
you in the name of the syndicate that we are immensely indebted to
you and I trust Mr Heldar you wont forget that we were largely
instrumental in bringing you before the public He panted because of
the seven flights of stairs

Dick glanced at Torpenhow whose left eyelid lay for a moment dead on
his cheek

I shant forget said Dick every instinct of defence roused in him

Youve paid me so well that I couldnt you know By the way when I am
settled in this place I should like to send and get my sketches There
must be nearly a hundred and fifty of them with you

That is eris what I came to speak about I fear we cant allow it
exactly Mr Heldar In the absence of any specified agreement the
sketches are our property of course

Do you mean to say that you are going to keep them

Yes and we hope to have your help on your own terms Mr Heldar to
assist us in arranging a little exhibition which backed by our name
and the influence we naturally command among the press should be of
material service to you Sketches such as yours

Belong to me You engaged me by wire you paid me the lowest rates you
dared You cant mean to keep them Good God alive man theyre all
Ive got in the world

Torpenhow watched Dicks face and whistled

Dick walked up and down thinking He saw the whole of his little stock
in trade the first weapon of his equipment annexed at the outset of
his campaign by an elderly gentleman whose name Dick had not caught
aright who said that he represented a syndicate which was a thing for
which Dick had not the least reverence The injustice of the proceedings
did not much move him he had seen the strong hand prevail too often in
other places to be squeamish over the moral aspects of right and wrong

But he ardently desired the blood of the gentleman in the frockcoat
and when he spoke again it was with a strained sweetness that Torpenhow
knew well for the beginning of strife

Forgive me sir but you have nono younger man who can arrange this
business with me

I speak for the syndicate I see no reason for a third party to

You will in a minute Be good enough to give back my sketches

The man stared blankly at Dick and then at Torpenhow who was leaning
against the wall He was not used to exemployees who ordered him to be
good enough to do things

Yes it is rather a coldblooded steal said Torpenhow critically
but Im afraid I am very much afraid youve struck the wrong man Be
careful Dick remember this isnt the Soudan

Considering what services the syndicate have done you in putting your
name before the world

This was not a fortunate remark it reminded Dick of certain vagrant
years lived out in loneliness and strife and unsatisfied desires The
memory did not contrast well with the prosperous gentleman who proposed
to enjoy the fruit of those years

I dont know quite what to do with you began Dick meditatively Of
course youre a thief and you ought to be half killed but in your case
youd probably die I dont want you dead on this floor and besides
its unlucky just as ones moving in Dont hit sir youll only excite
yourself

He put one hand on the mans forearm and ran the other down the plump
body beneath the coat My goodness said he to Torpenhow and this
gray oaf dares to be a thief I have seen an Esneh cameldriver have the
black hide taken off his body in strips for stealing half a pound of wet
dates and he was as tough as whipcord This things soft all overlike
a woman

There are few things more poignantly humiliating than being handled by
a man who does not intend to strike The head of the syndicate began to
breathe heavily Dick walked round him pawing him as a cat paws a
soft hearthrug Then he traced with his forefinger the leaden pouches
underneath the eyes and shook his head You were going to steal my
thingsmine mine mineyou who dont know when you may die Write
a note to your officeyou say youre the head of itand order them
to give Torpenhow my sketchesevery one of them Wait a minute your
hands shaking Now He thrust a pocketbook before him The note
was written Torpenhow took it and departed without a word while Dick
walked round and round the spellbound captive giving him such advice as
he conceived best for the welfare of his soul When Torpenhow returned
with a gigantic portfolio he heard Dick say almost soothingly Now
I hope this will be a lesson to you and if you worry me when I have
settled down to work with any nonsense about actions for assault
believe me Ill catch you and manhandle you and youll die You
havent very long to live anyhow Go Imshi Vootsakget out The
man departed staggering and dazed Dick drew a long breath Phew what
a lawless lot these people are The first thing a poor orphan meets is
gang robbery organised burglary Think of the hideous blackness of that
mans mind Are my sketches all right Torp

Yes one hundred and fortyseven of them Well I must say Dick
youve begun well

He was interfering with me It only meant a few pounds to him but it
was everything to me I dont think hell bring an action I gave him
some medical advice gratis about the state of his body It was cheap at
the little flurry it cost him Now lets look at my things

Two minutes later Dick had thrown himself down on the floor and was deep
in the portfolio chuckling lovingly as he turned the drawings over and
thought of the price at which they had been bought

The afternoon was well advanced when Torpenhow came to the door and saw
Dick dancing a wild saraband under the skylight

I builded better than I knew Torp he said without stopping the
dance Theyre good Theyre damned good Theyll go like flame I
shall have an exhibition of them on my own brazen hook And that man
would have cheated me out of it Do you know that Im sorry now that I
didnt actually hit him

Go out said Torpenhowgo out and pray to be delivered from the
sin of arrogance which you never will be Bring your things up from
whatever place youre staying in and well try to make this barn a
little more shipshape

And thenoh then said Dick still capering we will spoil the
Egyptians



CHAPTER IV

 The wolfcub at even lay hid in the corn
 When the smoke of the cooking hung gray
 He knew where the doe made a couch for her fawn
 And he looked to his strength for his prey

 But the moon swept the smokewreaths away

 And he turned from his meal in the villagers close
 And he bayed to the moon as she rose
 In Seonee

WELL and how does success taste said Torpenhow some three months
later He had just returned to chambers after a holiday in the country

Good said Dick as he sat licking his lips before the easel in the
studio

I want moreheaps more The lean years have passed and I approve of
these fat ones

Be careful old man That way lies bad work

Torpenhow was sprawling in a long chair with a small foxterrier asleep
on his chest while Dick was preparing a canvas A dais a background
and a layfigure were the only fixed objects in the place They rose
from a wreck of oddments that began with feltcovered waterbottles
belts and regimental badges and ended with a small bale of secondhand
uniforms and a stand of mixed arms The mark of muddy feet on the dais
showed that a military model had just gone away The watery autumn
sunlight was falling and shadows sat in the corners of the studio

Yes said Dick deliberately I like the power I like the fun I
like the fuss and above all I like the money I almost like the
people who make the fuss and pay the money Almost But theyre a queer
gangan amazingly queer gang

They have been good enough to you at any rate That tinpot exhibition
of your sketches must have paid Did you see that the papers called it
the Wild Work Show

Never mind I sold every shred of canvas I wanted to and on my word
I believe it was because they believed I was a selftaught flagstone
artist I should have got better prices if I worked my things on wool or
scratched them on camelbone instead of using mere black and white and
colour Verily they are a queer gang these people Limited isnt the
word to describe em I met a fellow the other day who told me
that it was impossible that shadows on white sand should be
blueultramarineas they are I found out later that the man had
been as far as Brighton beach but he knew all about Art confound him
He gave me a lecture on it and recommended me to go to school to learn
technique I wonder what old Kami would have said to that

When were you under Kami man of extraordinary beginnings

I studied with him for two years in Paris He taught by personal
magnetism All he ever said was Continuez mes enfants and you had
to make the best you could of that He had a divine touch and he knew
something about colour Kami used to dream colour I swear he could
never have seen the genuine article but he evolved it and it was
good

Recollect some of those views in the Soudan said Torpenhow with a
provoking drawl

Dick squirmed in his place Dont It makes me want to get out there
again What colour that was Opal and umber and amber and claret and
brickred and sulphurcockatoocrestsulphuragainst brown with a
niggerblack rock sticking up in the middle of it all and a decorative
frieze of camels festooning in front of a pure pale turquoise sky He
began to walk up and down And yet you know if you try to give these
people the thing as God gave it keyed down to their comprehension and
according to the powers He has given you

Modest man Go on

Half a dozen epicene young pagans who havent even been to Algiers will
tell you first that your notion is borrowed and secondly that it
isnt Art

This comes of my leaving town for a month Dickie youve been
promenading among the toyshops and hearing people talk

I couldnt help it said Dick penitently You werent here and it
was lonely these long evenings A man cant work for ever

A man might have gone to a pub and got decently drunk

I wish I had but I forgathered with some men of sorts They said they
were artists and I knew some of them could drawbut they wouldnt
draw They gave me teatea at five in the afternoonand talked about
Art and the state of their souls As if their souls mattered Ive heard
more about Art and seen less of her in the last six months than in
the whole of my life Do you remember Cassavetti who worked for some
continental syndicate out with the desert column He was a regular
Christmastree of contraptions when he took the field in full fig with
his waterbottle lanyard revolver writingcase housewife giglamps
and the Lord knows what all He used to fiddle about with em and show
us how they worked but he never seemed to do much except fudge his
reports from the Nilghai See

Dear old Nilghai Hes in town fatter than ever He ought to be up
here this evening I see the comparison perfectly You should have kept
clear of all that manmillinery Serves you right and I hope it will
unsettle your mind

It wont It has taught me what Artholy sacred Artmeans

Youve learnt something while Ive been away What is Art

Give em what they know and when youve done it once do it again

Dick dragged forward a canvas laid face to the wall Heres a sample
of real Art Its going to be a facsimile reproduction for a weekly I
called it His Last Shot Its worked up from the little watercolour
I made outside El Maghrib Well I lured my model a beautiful rifleman
up here with drink I drored him and I redrored him and I redrored
him and I made him a flushed dishevelled bedevilled scallawag with
his helmet at the back of his head and the living fear of death in his
eye and the blood oozing out of a cut over his anklebone He wasnt
pretty but he was all soldier and very much man

Once more modest child

Dick laughed Well its only to you Im talking I did him just as
well as I knew how making allowance for the slickness of oils Then the
artmanager of that abandoned paper said that his subscribers wouldnt
like it It was brutal and coarse and violentman being naturally
gentle when hes fighting for his life They wanted something more
restful with a little more colour I could have said a good deal but
you might as well talk to a sheep as an artmanager I took my Last
Shot back Behold the result I put him into a lovely red coat without
a speck on it That is Art I polished his bootsobserve the high
light on the toe That is Art I cleaned his riflerifles are
always clean on servicebecause that is Art I pipeclayed his
helmetpipeclay is always used on active service and is indispensable
to Art I shaved his chin I washed his hands and gave him an air of
fatted peace Result military tailors patternplate Price thank
Heaven twice as much as for the first sketch which was moderately
decent

And do you suppose youre going to give that thing out as your work

Why not I did it Alone I did it in the interests of sacred
homebred Art and Dickensons Weekly

Torpenhow smoked in silence for a while Then came the verdict
delivered from rolling clouds If you were only a mass of blathering
vanity Dick I wouldnt mindId let you go to the deuce on your own
mahlstick but when I consider what you are to me and when I find
that to vanity you add the twopennyhalfpenny pique of a twelveyearold
girl then I bestir myself in your behalf Thus

The canvas ripped as Torpenhows booted foot shot through it and the
terrier jumped down thinking rats were about

If you have any bad language to use use it You have not I continue
You are an idiot because no man born of woman is strong enough to take
liberties with his public even though they bewhich they aintall
you say they are

But they dont know any better What can you expect from creatures born
and bred in this light Dick pointed to the yellow fog If they want
furniturepolish let them have furniturepolish so long as they pay
for it They are only men and women You talk as if they were gods

That sounds very fine but it has nothing to do with the case They are
they people you have to do work for whether you like it or not They
are your masters Dont be deceived Dickie you arent strong enough to
trifle with themor with yourself which is more important

MoreoverCome back Binkie that red daub isnt going
anywhereunless you take precious good care you will fall under the
damnation of the checkbook and thats worse than death You will get
drunkyoure half drunk alreadyon easily acquired money For that
money and you own infernal vanity you are willing to deliberately turn
out bad work Youll do quite enough bad work without knowing it And
Dickie as I love you and as I know you love me I am not going to let
you cut off your nose to spite your face for all the gold in England
Thats settled Now swear

Dont know said Dick Ive been trying to make myself angry but
I cant youre so abominably reasonable There will be a row on
Dickensons Weekly I fancy

Why the Dickenson do you want to work on a weekly paper Its slow
bleeding of power

It brings in the very desirable dollars said Dick his hands in his
pockets

Torpenhow watched him with large contempt Why I thought it was a
man said he Its a child

No it isnt said Dick wheeling quickly Youve no notion what the
certainty of cash means to a man who has always wanted it badly Nothing
will pay me for some of my lifes joys on that Chinese pigboat for
instance when we ate bread and jam for every meal because HoWang
wouldnt allow us anything better and it all tasted of pigChinese
pig Ive worked for this Ive sweated and Ive starved for this line
on line and month after month And now Ive got it I am going to make
the most of it while it lasts Let them paytheyve no knowledge

What does Your Majesty please to want You cant smoke more than you
do you wont drink youre a gross feeder and you dress in the dark
by the look of you You wouldnt keep a horse the other day when I
suggested because you said it might fall lame and whenever you cross
the street you take a hansom Even you are not foolish enough to suppose
that theatres and all the live things you can by thereabouts mean Life
What earthly need have you for money

Its there bless its golden heart said Dick Its there all the
time Providence has sent me nuts while I have teeth to crack em with
I havent yet found the nut I wish to crack but Im keeping my teeth
filed Perhaps some day you and I will go for a walk round the wide
earth

With no work to do nobody to worry us and nobody to compete with You
would be unfit to speak to in a week Besides I shouldnt go I dont
care to profit by the price of a mans soulfor thats what it would
mean Dick its no use arguing Youre a fool

Dont see it When I was on that Chinese pigboat our captain got
credit for saving about twentyfive thousand very seasick little pigs
when our old tramp of a steamer fell foul of a timberjunk Now taking
those pigs as a parallel

Oh confound your parallels Whenever I try to improve your soul you
always drag in some anecdote from your very shady past Pigs arent the
British public and selfrespect is selfrespect the world over Go
out for a walk and try to catch some selfrespect And I say if the
Nilghai comes up this evening can I show him your diggings

Surely And Dick departed to take counsel with himself in the rapidly
gathering London fog

Half an hour after he had left the Nilghai laboured up the staircase
He was the chiefest as he was the youngest of the war correspondents
and his experiences dated from the birth of the needlegun Saving only
his ally Keneu the Great War Eagle there was no man higher in the
craft than he and he always opened his conversation with the news that
there would be trouble in the Balkans in the spring Torpenhow laughed
as he entered

Never mind the trouble in the Balkans Those little states are always
screeching Youve heard about Dicks luck

Yes he has been called up to notoriety hasnt he I hope you keep him
properly humble He wants suppressing from time to time

He does Hes beginning to take liberties with what he thinks is his
reputation

Already By Jove he has cheek I dont know about his reputation but
hell come a cropper if he tries that sort of thing

So I told him I dont think he believes it

They never do when they first start off Whats that wreck on the
ground there

Specimen of his latest impertinence Torpenhow thrust the torn edges
of the canvas together and showed the wellgroomed picture to the
Nilghai who looked at it for a moment and whistled

Its a chromo said hea chromolitholeomargarine fake What
possessed him to do it And yet how thoroughly he has caught the note
that catches a public who think with their boots and read with their
elbows The coldblooded insolence of the work almost saves it but
he mustnt go on with this Hasnt he been praised and cockered up too
much You know these people here have no sense of proportion Theyll
call him a second Detaille and a thirdhand Meissonier while his fashion
lasts Its windy diet for a colt

I dont think it affects Dick much You might as well call a young
wolf a lion and expect him to take the compliment in exchange for a
shinbone Dicks soul is in the bank Hes working for cash

Now he has thrown up war work I suppose he doesnt see that the
obligations of the service are just the same only the proprietors are
changed

How should he know He thinks he is his own master

Does he I could undeceive him for his good if theres any virtue in
print He wants the whiplash

Lay it on with science then Id flay him myself but I like him too
much

Ive no scruples He had the audacity to try to cut me out with a woman
at Cairo once I forgot that but I remember now

Did he cut you out

Youll see when I have dealt with him But after all whats the
good Leave him alone and hell come home if he has any stuff in him
dragging or wagging his tail behind him Theres more in a week of life
than in a lively weekly None the less Ill slate him Ill slate him
ponderously in the Cataclysm

Good luck to you but I fancy nothing short of a crowbar would make
Dick wince His soul seems to have been fired before we came across him
Hes intensely suspicious and utterly lawless

Matter of temper said the Nilghai Its the same with horses Some
you wallop and they work some you wallop and they jib and some you
wallop and they go out for a walk with their hands in their pockets

Thats exactly what Dick has done said Torpenhow Wait till he comes
back In the meantime you can begin your slating here Ill show you
some of his last and worst work in his studio

Dick had instinctively sought running water for a comfort to his mood of
mind He was leaning over the Embankment wall watching the rush of the
Thames through the arches of Westminster Bridge He began by thinking of
Torpenhows advice but as of custom lost himself in the study of the
faces flocking past Some had death written on their features and Dick
marvelled that they could laugh Others clumsy and coarsebuilt for
the most part were alight with love others were merely drawn and lined
with work but there was something Dick knew to be made out of them
all The poor at least should suffer that he might learn and the rich
should pay for the output of his learning Thus his credit in the world
and his cash balance at the bank would be increased So much the better
for him He had suffered Now he would take toll of the ills of others

The fog was driven apart for a moment and the sun shone a bloodred
wafer on the water Dick watched the spot till he heard the voice of
the tide between the piers die down like the wash of the sea at low
tide A girl hard pressed by her lover shouted shamelessly Ah get
away you beast and a shift of the same wind that had opened the fog
drove across Dicks face the black smoke of a riversteamer at her berth
below the wall He was blinded for the moment then spun round and found
himself face to face withMaisie

There was no mistaking The years had turned the child to a woman but
they had not altered the darkgray eyes the thin scarlet lips or the
firmly modelled mouth and chin and that all should be as it was of
old she wore a closely fitting gray dress

Since the human soul is finite and not in the least under its own
command Dick advancing said Halloo after the manner of schoolboys
and Maisie answered Oh Dick is that you Then against his will
and before the brain newly released from considerations of the cash
balance had time to dictate to the nerves every pulse of Dicks body
throbbed furiously and his palate dried in his mouth The fog shut down
again and Maisies face was pearlwhite through it No word was spoken
but Dick fell into step at her side and the two paced the Embankment
together keeping the step as perfectly as in their afternoon excursions
to the mudflats Then Dick a little hoarselyWhat has happened to
Amomma

He died Dick Not cartridges overeating He was always greedy Isnt
it funny

Yes No Do you mean Amomma

Yees No This Where have you come from

Over there He pointed eastward through the fog And you

Oh Im in the norththe black north across all the Park I am very
busy

What do you do

I paint a great deal Thats all I have to do

Why whats happened You had three hundred a year

I have that still I am painting thats all

Are you alone then

Theres a girl living with me Dont walk so fast Dick youre out of
step

Then you noticed it too

Of course I did Youre always out of step

So I am Im sorry You went on with the painting

Of course I said I should I was at the Slade then at Mertons in St
Johns Wood the big studio then I pepperpottedI mean I went to the
Nationaland now Im working under Kami

But Kami is in Paris surely

No he has his teaching studio in VitrysurMarne I work with him in
the summer and I live in London in the winter Im a householder

Do you sell much

Now and again but not often There is my bus I must take it or lose
half an hour Goodbye Dick

Goodbye Maisie Wont you tell me where you live I must see you
again and perhaps I could help you II paint a little myself

I may be in the Park tomorrow if there is no working light I walk
from the Marble Arch down and back again that is my little excursion
But of course I shall see you again She stepped into the omnibus and
was swallowed up by the fog

WellIamdamned exclaimed Dick and returned to the chambers

Torpenhow and the Nilghai found him sitting on the steps to the studio
door repeating the phrase with an awful gravity

Youll be more damned when Im done with you said the Nilghai
upheaving his bulk from behind Torpenhows shoulder and waving a sheaf
of halfdry manuscript Dick it is of common report that you are
suffering from swelled head

Halloo Nilghai Back again How are the Balkans and all the little
Balkans One side of your face is out of drawing as usual

Never mind that I am commissioned to smite you in print Torpenhow
refuses from false delicacy Ive been overhauling the potboilers in
your studio They are simply disgraceful

Oho thats it is it If you think you can slate me youre wrong You
can only describe and you need as much room to turn in on paper as a
P and O cargoboat But continue and be swift Im going to bed

Hm hm hm The first part only deals with your pictures Heres
the peroration For work done without conviction for power wasted on
trivialities for labour expended with levity for the deliberate purpose
of winning the easy applause of a fashiondriven public

Thats His Last Shot second edition Go on

public there remains but one endthe oblivion that is preceded
by toleration and cenotaphed with contempt From that fate Mr Heldar
has yet to prove himself out of danger

Wowwowwowwowwow said Dick profanely Its a clumsy ending
and vile journalese but its quite true And yethe sprang to his
feet and snatched at the manuscriptyou scarred deboshed battered
old gladiator youre sent out when a war begins to minister to the
blind brutal British publics bestial thirst for blood They have
no arenas now but they must have special correspondents Youre a fat
gladiator who comes up through a trapdoor and talks of what hes seen
You stand on precisely the same level as an energetic bishop an affable
actress a devastating cyclone ormine own sweet self And you
presume to lecture me about my work Nilghai if it were worth while Id
caricature you in four papers

The Nilghai winced He had not thought of this

As it is I shall take this stuff and tear it smallso The
manuscript fluttered in slips down the dark well of the staircase Go
home Nilghai said Dick go home to your lonely little bed and leave
me in peace I am about to turn in till to morrow

Why it isnt seven yet said Torpenhow with amazement

It shall be two in the morning if I choose said Dick backing to the
studio door I go to grapple with a serious crisis and I shant want
any dinner

The door shut and was locked

What can you do with a man like that said the Nilghai

Leave him alone Hes as mad as a hatter

At eleven there was a kicking on the studio door Is the Nilghai with
you still said a voice from within Then tell him he might have
condensed the whole of his lumbering nonsense into an epigram Only
the free are bond and only the bond are free Tell him hes an idiot
Torp and tell him Im another

All right Come out and have supper Youre smoking on an empty
stomach

There was no answer



CHAPTER V

 I have a thousand men said he
 To wait upon my will
 And towers nine upon the Tyne
 And three upon the Till

 And what care I for you men said she
 Or towers from Tyne to Till
 Sith you must go with me she said
 To wait upon my will
 Sir Hoggie and the Fairies

Next morning Torpenhow found Dick sunk in deepest repose of tobacco

Well madman how dyou feel

I dont know Im trying to find out

You had much better do some work

Maybe but Im in no hurry Ive made a discovery Torp theres too
much Ego in my Cosmos

Not really Is this revelation due to my lectures or the Nilghais

It came to me suddenly all on my own account Much too much Ego and
now Im going to work

He turned over a few halffinished sketches drummed on a new canvas
cleaned three brushes set Binkie to bite the toes of the lay figure
rattled through his collection of arms and accoutrements and then went
out abruptly declaring that he had done enough for the day

This is positively indecent said Torpenhow and the first time that
Dick has ever broken up a light morning Perhaps he has found out
that he has a soul or an artistic temperament or something equally
valuable That comes of leaving him alone for a month Perhaps he
has been going out of evenings I must look to this He rang for the
baldheaded old housekeeper whom nothing could astonish or annoy

Beeton did Mr Heldar dine out at all while I was out of town

Never laid is dressclothes out once sir all the time Mostly e
dined in but e brought some most remarkable young gentlemen up ere
after theatres once or twice Remarkable fancy they was You gentlemen
on the top floor does very much as you likes but it do seem to me sir
droppin a walkinstick down five flights o stairs an then goin
down four abreast to pick it up again at halfpast two in the mornin
singin Bring back the whiskey Willie darlinnot once or twice
but scores o timesisnt charity to the other tenants What I say is
Do as you would be done by Thats my motto

Of course of course Im afraid the top floor isnt the quietest in
the house

I make no complaints sir I have spoke to Mr Heldar friendly an
he laughed an did me a picture of the missis that is as good as a
coloured print It asnt the high shine of a photograph but what I say
is Never look a gifthorse in the mouth Mr Heldars dressclothes
avent been on him for weeks

Then its all right said Torpenhow to himself Orgies are healthy
and Dick has a head of his own but when it comes to women making
eyes Im not so certainBinkie never you be a man little dorglums
Theyre contrary brutes and they do things without any reason

Dick had turned northward across the Park but he was walking in the
spirit on the mudflats with Maisie He laughed aloud as he remembered
the day when he had decked Amommas horns with the hamfrills and
Maisie white with rage had cuffed him How long those four years
seemed in review and how closely Maisie was connected with every hour
of them Storm across the sea and Maisie in a gray dress on the beach
sweeping her drenched hair out of her eyes and laughing at the homeward
race of the fishingsmacks hot sunshine on the mudflats and Maisie
sniffing scornfully with her chin in the air Maisie flying before
the wind that threshed the foreshore and drove the sand like small shot
about her ears Maisie very composed and independent telling lies to
Mrs Jennett while Dick supported her with coarser perjuries Maisie
picking her way delicately from stone to stone a pistol in her hand
and her teeth firmset and Maisie in a gray dress sitting on the
grass between the mouth of a cannon and a nodding yellow seapoppy The
pictures passed before him one by one and the last stayed the longest

Dick was perfectly happy with a quiet peace that was as new to his mind
as it was foreign to his experiences It never occurred to him that
there might be other calls upon his time than loafing across the Park in
the forenoon

Theres a good working light now he said watching his shadow
placidly Some poor devil ought to be grateful for this And theres
Maisie

She was walking towards him from the Marble Arch and he saw that no
mannerism of her gait had been changed It was good to find her still
Maisie and so to speak his nextdoor neighbour No greeting passed
between them because there had been none in the old days

What are you doing out of your studio at this hour said Dick as one
who was entitled to ask

Idling Just idling I got angry with a chin and scraped it out Then I
left it in a little heap of paintchips and came away

I know what paletteknifing means What was the piccy

A fancy head that wouldnt come righthorrid thing

I dont like working over scraped paint when Im doing flesh The grain
comes up woolly as the paint dries

Not if you scrape properly Maisie waved her hand to illustrate her
methods There was a dab of paint on the white cuff Dick laughed

Youre as untidy as ever

That comes well from you Look at your own cuff

By Jove yes Its worse than yours I dont think weve much altered
in anything Lets see though He looked at Maisie critically The
pale blue haze of an autumn day crept between the treetrunks of the
Park and made a background for the gray dress the black velvet toque
above the black hair and the resolute profile

No theres nothing changed How good it is Dyou remember when I
fastened your hair into the snap of a handbag

Maisie nodded with a twinkle in her eyes and turned her full face to
Dick

Wait a minute said he That mouth is down at the corners a little
Whos been worrying you Maisie

No one but myself I never seem to get on with my work and yet I try
hard enough and Kami says

Continuez mesdemoiselles Continuez toujours mes enfants Kami is
depressing I beg your pardon

Yes thats what he says He told me last summer that I was doing
better and hed let me exhibit this year

Not in this place surely

Of course not The Salon

You fly high

Ive been beating my wings long enough Where do you exhibit Dick

I dont exhibit I sell

What is your line then

Havent you heard Dicks eyes opened Was this thing possible He
cast about for some means of conviction They were not far from the
Marble Arch Come up Oxford Street a little and Ill show you

A small knot of people stood round a printshop that Dick knew well

Some reproduction of my work inside he said with suppressed triumph
Never before had success tasted so sweet upon the tongue You see the
sort of things I paint Dyou like it

Maisie looked at the wild whirling rush of a fieldbattery going into
action under fire Two artillerymen stood behind her in the crowd

Theyve chucked the off leadorse said one to the other Es tore
up awful but theyre makin good time with the others That leaddriver
drives better nor you Tom See ow cunnin es nursin is orse

Number Threell be off the limber next jolt was the answer

No e wont See ow is foots braced against the iron Es all
right

Dick watched Maisies face and swelled with joyfine rank vulgar
triumph She was more interested in the little crowd than in the
picture

That was something that she could understand

And I wanted it so Oh I did want it so she said at last under her
breath

Meall me said Dick placidly Look at their faces It hits em
They dont know what makes their eyes and mouths open but I know And I
know my works right

Yes I see Oh what a thing to have come to one

Come to one indeed I had to go out and look for it What do you
think

I call it success Tell me how you got it

They returned to the Park and Dick delivered himself of the saga of his
own doings with all the arrogance of a young man speaking to a woman

From the beginning he told the tale the IIIs flashing through the
records as telegraphpoles fly past the traveller Maisie listened and
nodded her head The histories of strife and privation did not move her
a hairsbreadth At the end of each canto he would conclude And that
gave me some notion of handling colour or light or whatever it might
be that he had set out to pursue and understand He led her breathless
across half the world speaking as he had never spoken in his life
before

And in the floodtide of his exaltation there came upon him a great
desire to pick up this maiden who nodded her head and said I
understand Go onto pick her up and carry her away with him because
she was Maisie and because she understood and because she was his
right and a woman to be desired above all women

Then he checked himself abruptly And so I took all I wanted he said
and I had to fight for it Now you tell

Maisies tale was almost as gray as her dress It covered years of
patient toil backed by savage pride that would not be broken though
dealers laughed and fogs delayed work and Kami was unkind and even
sarcastic and girls in other studios were painfully polite It had a
few bright spots in pictures accepted at provincial exhibitions but
it wound up with the oft repeated wail And so you see Dick I had no
success though I worked so hard

Then pity filled Dick Even thus had Maisie spoken when she could not
hit the breakwater half an hour before she had kissed him And that had
happened yesterday

Never mind he said Ill tell you something if youll believe it
The words were shaping themselves of their own accord The whole thing
lock stock and barrel isnt worth one big yellow seapoppy below Fort
Keeling

Maisie flushed a little Its all very well for you to talk but youve
had the success and I havent

Let me talk then I know youll understand Maisie dear it sounds a
bit absurd but those ten years never existed and Ive come back again
It really is just the same Cant you see Youre alone now and Im
alone Whats the use of worrying Come to me instead darling

Maisie poked the gravel with her parasol They were sitting on a bench

I understand she said slowly But Ive got my work to do and I must
do it

Do it with me then dear I wont interrupt

No I couldnt Its my workmineminemine Ive been alone all
my life in myself and Im not going to belong to anybody except myself
I remember things as well as you do but that doesnt count We were
babies then and we didnt know what was before us Dick dont be
selfish I think I see my way to a little success next year Dont take
it away from me

I beg your pardon darling Its my fault for speaking stupidly I
cant expect you to throw up all your life just because Im back Ill
go to my own place and wait a little

But Dick I dont want you togoout ofmy life now youve just
come back

Im at your orders forgive me Dick devoured the troubled little face
with his eyes There was triumph in them because he could not conceive
that Maisie should refuse sooner or later to love him since he loved
her

Its wrong of me said Maisie more slowly than before its wrong
and selfish but oh Ive been so lonely No you misunderstand Now
Ive seen you againits absurd but I want to keep you in my life

Naturally We belong

We dont but you always understood me and there is so much in my work
that you could help me in You know things and the ways of doing things
You must

I do I fancy or else I dont know myself Then you wont care to lose
sight of me altogether andyou want me to help you in your work

Yes but remember Dick nothing will ever come of it Thats why I
feel so selfish Cant things stay as they are I do want your help

You shall have it But lets consider I must see your pics first and
overhaul your sketches and find out about your tendencies You should
see what the papers say about my tendencies Then Ill give you good
advice and you shall paint according Isnt that it Maisie

Again there was triumph in Dicks eye

Its too good of youmuch too good Because you are consoling
yourself with what will never happen and I know that and yet I want to
keep you Dont blame me later please

Im going into the matter with my eyes open Moreover the Queen can
do no wrong It isnt your selfishness that impresses me Its your
audacity in proposing to make use of me

Pooh Youre only Dickand a printshop

Very good thats all I am But Maisie you believe dont you that I
love you I dont want you to have any false notions about brothers and
sisters

Maisie looked up for a moment and dropped her eyes

Its absurd butI believe I wish I could send you away before you
get angry with me Butbut the girl that lives with me is redhaired
and an impressionist and all our notions clash

So do ours I think Never mind Three months from today we shall be
laughing at this together

Maisie shook her head mournfully I knew you wouldnt understand and
it will only hurt you more when you find out Look at my face Dick and
tell me what you see

They stood up and faced each other for a moment The fog was gathering
and it stifled the roar of the traffic of London beyond the railings
Dick brought all his painfully acquired knowledge of faces to bear on
the eyes mouth and chin underneath the black velvet toque

Its the same Maisie and its the same me he said Weve both nice
little wills of our own and one or other of us has to be broken Now
about the future I must come and see your pictures some dayI suppose
when the redhaired girl is on the premises

Sundays are my best times You must come on Sundays There are such
heaps of things I want to talk about and ask your advice about Now I
must get back to work

Try to find out before next Sunday what I am said Dick Dont take
my word for anything Ive told you Goodbye darling and bless you

Maisie stole away like a little gray mouse Dick watched her till she
was out of sight but he did not hear her say to herself very soberly
Im a wretcha horrid selfish wretch But its Dick and Dick will
understand

No one has yet explained what actually happens when an irresistible
force meets the immovable post though many have thought deeply even as
Dick thought He tried to assure himself that Maisie would be led in
a few weeks by his mere presence and discourse to a better way of
thinking Then he remembered much too distinctly her face and all that
was written on it

If I know anything of heads he said theres everything in that face
but love I shall have to put that in myself and that chin and mouth
wont be won for nothing But shes right She knows what she wants and
shes going to get it What insolence Me Of all the people in the wide
world to use me But then shes Maisie Theres no getting over that
fact and its good to see her again This business must have been
simmering at the back of my head for years Shell use me as I
used Binat at Port Said Shes quite right It will hurt a little
I shall have to see her every Sundaylike a young man courting a
housemaid Shes sure to come around and yetthat mouth isnt a
yielding mouth I shall be wanting to kiss her all the time and I shall
have to look at her picturesI dont even know what sort of work she
does yetand I shall have to talk about ArtWomans Art Therefore
particularly and perpetually damn all varieties of Art It did me a
good turn once and now its in my way Ill go home and do some Art

Halfway to the studio Dick was smitten with a terrible thought The
figure of a solitary woman in the fog suggested it

Shes all alone in London with a redhaired impressionist girl who
probably has the digestion of an ostrich Most redhaired people have
Maisies a bilious little body Theyll eat like lone womenmeals at
all hours and tea with all meals I remember how the students in Paris
used to pig along She may fall ill at any minute and I shant be able
to help Whew this is ten times worse than owning a wife

Torpenhow entered the studio at dusk and looked at Dick with eyes full
of the austere love that springs up between men who have tugged at the
same oar together and are yoked by custom and use and the intimacies of
toil This is a good love and since it allows and even encourages
strife recrimination and brutal sincerity does not die but grows
and is proof against any absence and evil conduct

Dick was silent after he handed Torpenhow the filled pipe of council He
thought of Maisie and her possible needs It was a new thing to think of
anybody but Torpenhow who could think for himself Here at last was an
outlet for that cash balance He could adorn Maisie barbarically with
jewelrya thick gold necklace round that little neck bracelets
upon the rounded arms and rings of price upon her handsthe cool
temperate ringless hands that he had taken between his own It was an
absurd thought for Maisie would not even allow him to put one ring on
one finger and she would laugh at golden trappings It would be better
to sit with her quietly in the dusk his arm around her neck and her
face on his shoulder as befitted husband and wife Torpenhows boots
creaked that night and his strong voice jarred Dicks brows contracted
and he murmured an evil word because he had taken all his success as a
right and part payment for past discomfort and now he was checked in
his stride by a woman who admitted all the success and did not instantly
care for him

I say old man said Torpenhow who had made one or two vain attempts
at conversation I havent put your back up by anything Ive said
lately have I

You No How could you

Liver out of order

The truly healthy man doesnt know he has a liver Im only a bit
worried about things in general I suppose its my soul

The truly healthy man doesnt know he has a soul What business have
you with luxuries of that kind

It came of itself Whos the man that says that were all islands
shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding

Hes right whoever he isexcept about the misunderstanding I dont
think we could misunderstand each other

The blue smoke curled back from the ceiling in clouds Then Torpenhow
insinuatinglyDick is it a woman

Be hanged if its anything remotely resembling a woman and if you
begin to talk like that Ill hire a redbrick studio with white paint
trimmings and begonias and petunias and blue Hungarias to play among
threeandsixpenny potpalms and Ill mount all my pics in anilinedye
plush plasters and Ill invite every woman who maunders over what her
guidebooks tell her is Art and you shall receive em Torpin a
snuffbrown velvet coat with yellow trousers and an orange tie Youll
like that

Too thin Dick A better man than you once denied with cursing and
swearing Youve overdone it just as he did Its no business of mine
of course but its comforting to think that somewhere under the stars
theres saving up for you a tremendous thrashing Whether itll come
from heaven or earth I dont know but its bound to come and break you
up a little You want hammering

Dick shivered All right said he When this island is disintegrated
it will call for you

I shall come round the corner and help to disintegrate it some more
Were talking nonsense Come along to a theatre



CHAPTER VI

 And you may lead a thousand men
 Nor ever draw the rein
 But ere ye lead the Faery Queen
 Twill burst your heart in twain

 He has slipped his foot from the stirrupbar
 The bridle from his hand
 And he is bound by hand and foot
 To the Queen o Faeryland
 Sir Hoggie and the Fairies

Some weeks later on a very foggy Sunday Dick was returning across the
Park to his studio This he said is evidently the thrashing that
Torp meant It hurts more than I expected but the Queen can do no
wrong and she certainly has some notion of drawing

He had just finished a Sunday visit to Maisiealways under the green
eyes of the redhaired impressionist girl whom he learned to hate
at sightand was tingling with a keen sense of shame Sunday after
Sunday putting on his best clothes he had walked over to the untidy
house north of the Park first to see Maisies pictures and then to
criticise and advise upon them as he realised that they were productions
on which advice would not be wasted Sunday after Sunday and his love
grew with each visit he had been compelled to cram his heart back from
between his lips when it prompted him to kiss Maisie several times and
very much indeed Sunday after Sunday the head above the heart had
warned him that Maisie was not yet attainable and that it would be
better to talk as connectedly as possible upon the mysteries of the
craft that was all in all to her Therefore it was his fate to endure
weekly torture in the studio built out over the clammy back garden of a
frail stuffy little villa where nothing was ever in its right place and
nobody every calledto endure and to watch Maisie moving to and fro
with the teacups He abhorred tea but since it gave him a little
longer time in her presence he drank it devoutly and the redhaired
girl sat in an untidy heap and eyed him without speaking She was always
watching him

Once and only once when she had left the studio Maisie showed him
an album that held a few poor cuttings from provincial papersthe
briefest of hurried notes on some of her pictures sent to outlying
exhibitions Dick stooped and kissed the paintsmudged thumb on the open
page Oh my love my love he muttered do you value these things
Chuck em into the wastepaper basket

Not till I get something better said Maisie shutting the book

Then Dick moved by no respect for his public and a very deep regard for
the maiden did deliberately propose in order to secure more of these
coveted cuttings that he should paint a picture which Maisie should
sign

Thats childish said Maisie and I didnt think it of you It must
be my work Mineminemine

Go and design decorative medallions for rich brewers houses You are
thoroughly good at that Dick was sick and savage

Better things than medallions Dick was the answer in tones that
recalled a grayeyed atoms fearless speech to Mrs Jennett Dick would
have abased himself utterly but that other girl trailed in

Next Sunday he laid at Maisies feet small gifts of pencils that could
almost draw of themselves and colours in whose permanence he believed
and he was ostentatiously attentive to the work in hand It demanded
among other things an exposition of the faith that was in him

Torpenhows hair would have stood on end had he heard the fluency with
which Dick preached his own gospel of Art

A month before Dick would have been equally astonished but it was
Maisies will and pleasure and he dragged his words together to make
plain to her comprehension all that had been hidden to himself of the
whys and wherefores of work There is not the least difficulty in doing
a thing if you only know how to do it the trouble is to explain your
method

I could put this right if I had a brush in my hand said Dick
despairingly over the modelling of a chin that Maisie complained would
not look fleshit was the same chin that she had scraped out with
the palette knifebut I find it almost impossible to teach you
Theres a queer grim Dutch touch about your painting that I like but
Ive a notion that youre weak in drawing You foreshorten as though you
never used the model and youve caught Kamis pasty way of dealing with
flesh in shadow Then again though you dont know it yourself you
shirk hard work Suppose you spend some of your time on line lone Line
doesnt allow of shirking Oils do and three square inches of flashy
tricky stuff in the corner of a pic sometimes carry a bad thing offas
I know Thats immoral Do linework for a little while and then I can
tell more about your powers as old Kami used to say

Maisie protested she did not care for the pure line

I know said Dick You want to do your fancy heads with a bunch of
flowers at the base of the neck to hide bad modelling The redhaired
girl laughed a little You want to do landscapes with cattle kneedeep
in grass to hide bad drawing You want to do a great deal more than
you can do You have sense of colour but you want form Colours a
giftput it aside and think no more about itbut form you can be
drilled into Now all your fancy headsand some of them are very
goodwill keep you exactly where you are With line you must go forward
or backward and it will show up all your weaknesses

But other people began Maisie

You mustnt mind what other people do If their souls were your soul
it would be different You stand and fall by your own work remember
and its waste of time to think of any one else in this battle

Dick paused and the longing that had been so resolutely put away came
back into his eyes He looked at Maisie and the look asked as plainly
as words Was it not time to leave all this barren wilderness of canvas
and counsel and join hands with Life and Love Maisie assented to the
new programme of schooling so adorably that Dick could hardly restrain
himself from picking her up then and there and carrying her off to the
nearest registrars office It was the implicit obedience to the spoken
word and the blank indifference to the unspoken desire that baffled and
buffeted his soul He held authority in that houseauthority limited
indeed to onehalf of one afternoon in seven but very real while it
lasted Maisie had learned to appeal to him on many subjects from the
proper packing of pictures to the condition of a smoky chimney The
redhaired girl never consulted him about anything

On the other hand she accepted his appearances without protest and
watched him always He discovered that the meals of the establishment
were irregular and fragmentary They depended chiefly on tea pickles
and biscuit as he had suspected from the beginning The girls were
supposed to market week and week about but they lived with the help of
a charwoman as casually as the young ravens Maisie spent most of her
income on models and the other girl revelled in apparatus as refined
as her work was rough Armed with knowledge dearbought from the Docks
Dick warned Maisie that the end of semistarvation meant the crippling
of power to work which was considerably worse than death

Maisie took the warning and gave more thought to what she ate and
drank When his trouble returned upon him as it generally did in the
long winter twilights the remembrance of that little act of domestic
authority and his coercion with a hearthbrush of the smoky drawingroom
chimney stung Dick like a whiplash

He conceived that this memory would be the extreme of his sufferings
till one Sunday the redhaired girl announced that she would make a
study of Dicks head and that he would be good enough to sit still
andquite as an afterthoughtlook at Maisie He sat because he could
not well refuse and for the space of half an hour he reflected on all
the people in the past whom he had laid open for the purposes of his
own craft He remembered Binat most distinctlythat Binat who had once
been an artist and talked about degradation

It was the merest monochrome roughing in of a head but it presented the
dumb waiting the longing and above all the hopeless enslavement of
the man in a spirit of bitter mockery

Ill buy it said Dick promptly at your own price

My price is too high but I dare say youll be as grateful if The
wet sketch fluttered from the girls hand and fell into the ashes of
the studio stove When she picked it up it was hopelessly smudged

Oh its all spoiled said Maisie And I never saw it Was it like

Thank you said Dick under his breath to the redhaired girl and he
removed himself swiftly

How that man hates me said the girl And how he loves you Maisie

What nonsense I knew Dicks very fond of me but he had his work to
do and I have mine

Yes he is fond of you and I think he knows there is something in
impressionism after all Maisie cant you see

See See what

Nothing only I know that if I could get any man to look at me as that
man looks at you IdI dont know what Id do But he hates me Oh
how he hates me

She was not altogether correct Dicks hatred was tempered with
gratitude for a few moments and then he forgot the girl entirely Only
the sense of shame remained and he was nursing it across the Park
in the fog Therell be an explosion one of these days he said
wrathfully But it isnt Maisies fault shes right quite right as
far as she knows and I cant blame her This business has been going
on for three months nearly Three monthsand it cost me ten years
knocking about to get at the notion the merest raw notion of my
work Thats true but then I didnt have pins drawingpins and
paletteknives stuck into me every Sunday

Oh my little darling if ever I break you somebody will have a very
bad time of it No she wont Id be as big a fool about her as I
am now Ill poison that redhaired girl on my weddingdayshes
unwholesomeand now Ill pass on these present bad times to Torp

Torpenhow had been moved to lecture Dick more than once lately on the
sin of levity and Dick and listened and replied not a word In the
weeks between the first few Sundays of his discipline he had flung
himself savagely into his work resolved that Maisie should at least
know the full stretch of his powers Then he had taught Maisie that she
must not pay the least attention to any work outside her own and
Maisie had obeyed him all too well She took his counsels but was not
interested in his pictures

Your things smell of tobacco and blood she said once Cant you do
anything except soldiers

I could do a head of you that would startle you thought
Dickthis was before the redhaired girl had brought him under
the guillotinebut he only said I am very sorry and harrowed
Torpenhows soul that evening with blasphemies against Art Later
insensibly and to a large extent against his own will he ceased to
interest himself in his own work

For Maisies sake and to soothe the selfrespect that it seemed to him
he lost each Sunday he would not consciously turn out bad stuff but
since Maisie did not care even for his best it were better not to
do anything at all save wait and mark time between Sunday and Sunday
Torpenhow was disgusted as the weeks went by fruitless and then
attacked him one Sunday evening when Dick felt utterly exhausted after
three hours biting selfrestraint in Maisies presence There was
Language and Torpenhow withdrew to consult the Nilghai who had come it
to talk continental politics

Boneidle is he Careless and touched in the temper said the
Nilghai It isnt worth worrying over Dick is probably playing the
fool with a woman

Isnt that bad enough

No She may throw him out of gear and knock his work to pieces for
a while She may even turn up here some day and make a scene on the
staircase one never knows But until Dick speaks of his own accord you
had better not touch him He is no easytempered man to handle

No I wish he were He is such an aggressive cocksure youbedamned
fellow

Hell get that knocked out of him in time He must learn that he cant
storm up and down the world with a box of moist tubes and a slick brush
Youre fond of him

Id take any punishment thats in store for him if I could but the
worst of it is no man can save his brother

No and the worser of it is there is no discharge in this war Dick
must learn his lesson like the rest of us Talking of war therell be
trouble in the Balkans in the spring

That trouble is long coming I wonder if we could drag Dick out there
when it comes off

Dick entered the room soon afterwards and the question was put to him

Not good enough he said shortly Im too comfy where I am

Surely you arent taking all the stuff in the papers seriously said
the Nilghai Your vogue will be ended in less than six monthsthe
public will know your touch and go on to something newand where will
you be then

Here in England

When you might be doing decent work among us out there Nonsense I
shall go the Keneu will be there Torp will be there Cassavetti will
be there and the whole lot of us will be there and we shall have as
much as ever we can do with unlimited fighting and the chance for you
of seeing things that would make the reputation of three Verestchagins

Um said Dick pulling at his pipe

You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at
your pictures Just think how full an average mans life is of his own
pursuits and pleasures When twenty thousand of him find time to look
up between mouthfuls and grunt something about something they arent
the least interested in the net result is called fame reputation or
notoriety according to the taste and fancy of the speller my lord

I know that as well as you do Give me credit for a little gumption

Be hanged if I do

Be hanged then you probably will befor a spy by excited Turks
Heighho Im weary dead weary and virtue has gone out of me Dick
dropped into a chair and was fast asleep in a minute

Thats a bad sign said the Nilghai in an undertone

Torpenhow picked the pipe from the waistcoat where it was beginning to
burn and put a pillow behind the head We cant help we cant help
he said Its a good ugly sort of old cocoanut and Im fond of it
Theres the scar of the wipe he got when he was cut over in the square

Shouldnt wonder if that has made him a trifle mad

I should Hes a most businesslike madman

Then Dick began to snore furiously

Oh here no affection can stand this sort of thing Wake up Dick and
go and sleep somewhere else if you intend to make a noise about it

When a cat has been out on the tiles all night said the Nilghai in
his beard I notice that she usually sleeps all day This is natural
history

Dick staggered away rubbing his eyes and yawning In the nightwatches
he was overtaken with an idea so simple and so luminous that he
wondered he had never conceived it before It was full of craft He
would seek Maisie on a weekdaywould suggest an excursion and would
take her by train to Fort Keeling over the very ground that they two
had trodden together ten years ago

As a general rule he explained to his chinlathered reflection in the
morning it isnt safe to cross an old trail twice Things remind one
of things and a cold wind gets up and you feel sad but this is an
exception to every rule that ever was Ill go to Maisie at once

Fortunately the redhaired girl was out shopping when he arrived and
Maisie in a paintspattered blouse was warring with her canvas She was
not pleased to see him for weekday visits were a stretch of the bond
and it needed all his courage to explain his errand

I know youve been working too hard he concluded with an air of
authority If you do that youll break down You had much better
come

Where said Maisie wearily She had been standing before her easel
too long and was very tired

Anywhere you please Well take a train tomorrow and see where it
stops Well have lunch somewhere and Ill bring you back in the
evening

If theres a good working light tomorrow I lose a day Maisie
balanced the heavy white chestnut palette irresolutely

Dick bit back an oath that was hurrying to his lips He had not yet
learned patience with the maiden to whom her work was all in all

Youll lose ever so many more dear if you use every hour of working
light Overworks only murderous idleness Dont be unreasonable Ill
call for you tomorrow after breakfast early

But surely you are going to ask

No I am not I want you and nobody else Besides she hates me as much
as I hate her She wont care to come Tomorrow then and pray that we
get sunshine

Dick went away delighted and by consequence did no work whatever

He strangled a wild desire to order a special train but bought a great
gray kangaroo cloak lined with glossy black marten and then retired
into himself to consider things

Im going out for the day tomorrow with Dick said Maisie to the
redhaired girl when the latter returned tired from marketing in the
Edgware road

He deserves it I shall have the studio floor thoroughly scrubbed while
youre away Its very dirty

Maisie had enjoyed no sort of holiday for months and looked forward to
the little excitement but not without misgivings

Theres nobody nicer than Dick when he talks sensibly she thought
but Im sure hell be silly and worry me and Im sure I cant tell him
anything hed like to hear If hed only be sensible I should like him
so much better

Dicks eyes were full of joy when he made his appearance next morning
and saw Maisie grayulstered and blackvelvethatted standing in the
hallway Palaces of marble and not sordid imitation of grained wood
were surely the fittest background for such a divinity The redhaired
girl drew her into the studio for a moment and kissed her hurriedly

Maisies eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead she was altogether
unused to these demonstrations Mind my hat she said hurrying away
and ran down the steps to Dick waiting by the hansom

Are you quite warm enough Are you sure you wouldnt like some more
breakfast Put the cloak over your knees

Im quite comfy thanks Where are we going Dick Oh do stop singing
like that People will think were mad

Let em thinkif the exertion doesnt kill them They dont know who
we are and Im sure I dont care who they are My faith Maisie youre
looking lovely

Maisie stared directly in front of her and did not reply The wind of a
keen clear winter morning had put colour into her cheeks Overhead
the creamyyellow smokeclouds were thinning away one by one against a
paleblue sky and the improvident sparrows broke off from waterspout
committees and cabrank cabals to clamour of the coming of spring

It will be lovely weather in the country said Dick

But where are we going

Wait and see

The stopped at Victoria and Dick sought tickets For less than half the
fraction of an instant it occurred to Maisie comfortably settled by the
waitingroom fire that it was much more pleasant to send a man to the
bookingoffice than to elbow ones own way through the crowd Dick put
her into a Pullmansolely on account of the warmth there and she
regarded the extravagance with grave scandalised eyes as the train moved
out into the country

I wish I knew where we are going she repeated for the twentieth time

The name of a wellremembered station flashed by towards the end of the
run and Maisie was delighted

Oh Dick you villain

Well I thought you might like to see the place again You havent been
here since the old times have you

No I never cared to see Mrs Jennett again and she was all that was
ever there

Not quite Look out a minute Theres the windmill above the
potatofields they havent built villas there yet dyou remember when
I shut you up in it

Yes How she beat you for it I never told it was you

She guessed I jammed a stick under the door and told you that I was
burying Amomma alive in the potatoes and you believed me You had a
trusting nature in those days

They laughed and leaned to look out identifying ancient landmarks with
many reminiscences Dick fixed his weather eye on the curve of Maisies
cheek very near his own and watched the blood rise under the clear
skin He congratulated himself upon his cunning and looked that the
evening would bring him a great reward

When the train stopped they went out to look at an old town with new
eyes First but from a distance they regarded the house of Mrs
Jennett

Suppose she should come out now what would you do said Dick with
mock terror

I should make a face

Show then said Dick dropping into the speech of childhood

Maisie made that face in the direction of the mean little villa and
Dick laughed

This is disgraceful said Maisie mimicking Mrs Jennetts tone
Maisie you run in at once and learn the collect gospel and epistle
for the next three Sundays After all Ive taught you too and three
helps every Sunday at dinner Dicks always leading you into mischief
If you arent a gentleman Dick you might at least

The sentence ended abruptly Maisie remembered when it had last been
used

Try to behave like one said Dick promptly Quite right Now well
get some lunch and go on to Fort Keelingunless youd rather drive
there

We must walk out of respect to the place How little changed it all
is

They turned in the direction of the sea through unaltered streets
and the influence of old things lay upon them Presently they passed
a confectioners shop much considered in the days when their joint
pocketmoney amounted to a shilling a week

Dick have you any pennies said Maisie half to herself

Only three and if you think youre going to have two of em to buy
peppermints with youre wrong She says peppermints arent ladylike

Again they laughed and again the colour came into Maisies cheeks as
the blood boiled through Dicks heart After a large lunch they went
down to the beach and to Fort Keeling across the waste windbitten land
that no builder had thought it worth his while to defile The winter
breeze came in from the sea and sang about their ears

Maisie said Dick your nose is getting a crude Prussian blue at the
tip Ill race you as far as you please for as much as you please

She looked round cautiously and with a laugh set off swiftly as the
ulster allowed till she was out of breath

We used to run miles she panted Its absurd that we cant run now

Old age dear This it is to get fat and sleek in town When I wished
to pull your hair you generally ran for three miles shrieking at the
top of your voice I ought to know because those shrieks of yours were
meant to call up Mrs Jennett with a cane and

Dick I never got you a beating on purpose in my life

No of course you never did Good heavens look at the sea

Why its the same as ever said Maisie

Torpenhow had gathered from Mr Beeton that Dick properly dressed and
shaved had left the house at halfpast eight in the morning with a
travellingrug over his arm The Nilghai rolled in at midday for chess
and polite conversation

Its worse than anything I imagined said Torpenhow

Oh the everlasting Dick I suppose You fuss over him like a hen with
one chick Let him run riot if he thinks itll amuse him You can whip a
young pup off feather but you cant whip a young man

It isnt a woman Its one woman and its a girl

Wheres your proof

He got up and went out at eight this morninggot up in the middle of
the night by Jove a thing he never does except when hes on service
Even then remember we had to kick him out of his blankets before the
fight began at ElMaghrib Its disgusting

It looks odd but maybe hes decided to buy a horse at last He might
get up for that mightnt he

Buy a blazing wheelbarrow Hed have told us if there was a horse in
the wind Its a girl

Dont be certain Perhaps its only a married woman

Dick has some sense of humour if you havent Who gets up in the gray
dawn to call on another mans wife Its a girl

Let it be a girl then She may teach him that theres somebody else in
the world besides himself

Shell spoil his hand Shell waste his time and shell marry him and
ruin his work for ever Hell be a respectable married man before we can
stop him andhell ever go on the long trail again

All quite possible but the earth wont spin the other way when that
happens No ho Id give something to see Dick go wooing with
the boys Dont worry about it These things be with Allah and we can
only look on Get the chessmen

The redhaired girl was lying down in her own room staring at the
ceiling The footsteps of people on the pavement sounded as they grew
indistinct in the distance like a manytimesrepeated kiss that was
all one long kiss Her hands were by her side and they opened and shut
savagely from time to time

The charwoman in charge of the scrubbing of the studio knocked at her
door Beg y pardon miss but in cleanin of a floor theres two
not to say three kind of soap which is yaller an mottled an
disinfectink Now jist before I took my pail into the passage I though
it would be preaps jest as well if I was to come up ere an ask you
what sort of soap you was wishful that I should use on them boards The
yaller soap miss

There was nothing in the speech to have caused the paroxysm of fury
that drove the redhaired girl into the middle of the room almost
shoutingDo you suppose I care what you use Any kind will doany
kind

The woman fled and the redhaired girl looked at her own reflection in
the glass for an instant and covered her face with her hands It was as
though she had shouted some shameless secret aloud



CHAPTER VII

 Roses red and roses white
 Plucked I for my loves delight

 She would none of all my posies
 Bade me gather her blue roses

 Half the world I wandered through
 Seeking where such flowers grew
 Half the world unto my quest
 Answered but with laugh and jest

 It may be beyond the grave
 She shall find what she would have

 Mine was but an idle quest
 Roses white and red are best
 Blue Roses

Indeed the sea had not changed Its waters were low on the mudbanks
and the Marazion Bellbuoy clanked and swung in the tideway On the
white beachsand dried stumps of seapoppy shivered and chattered

I dont see the old breakwater said Maisie under her breath

Lets be thankful that we have as much as we have I dont believe
theyve mounted a single new gun on the fort since we were here Come
and look

They came to the glacis of Fort Keeling and sat down in a nook
sheltered from the wind under the tarred throat of a fortypounder
cannon

Now if Ammoma were only here said Maisie

For a long time both were silent Then Dick took Maisies hand and
called her by her name

She shook her head and looked out to sea

Maisie darling doesnt it make any difference

No between clenched teeth IdId tell you if it did but it
doesnt Oh Dick please be sensible

Dont you think that it ever will

No Im sure it wont

Why

Maisie rested her chin on her hand and still regarding the sea spoke
hurriedlyI know what you want perfectly well but I cant give it to
you Dick It isnt my fault indeed it isnt If I felt that I
could care for any oneBut I dont feel that I care I simply dont
understand what the feeling means

Is that true dear

Youve been very good to me Dickie and the only way I can pay you
back is by speaking the truth I darent tell a fib I despise myself
quite enough as it is

What in the world for

Becausebecause I take everything that you give me and I give you
nothing in return Its mean and selfish of me and whenever I think of
it it worries me

Understand once for all then that I can manage my own affairs and if
I choose to do anything you arent to blame You havent a single thing
to reproach yourself with darling

Yes I have and talking only makes it worse

Then dont talk about it

How can I help myself If you find me alone for a minute you are always
talking about it and when you arent you look it You dont know how I
despise myself sometimes

Great goodness said Dick nearly jumping to his feet Speak the
truth now Maisie if you never speak it again Do Idoes this worrying
bore you

No It does not

Youd tell me if it did

I should let you know I think

Thank you The other thing is fatal But you must learn to forgive
a man when hes in love Hes always a nuisance You must have known
that

Maisie did not consider the last question worth answering and Dick was
forced to repeat it

There were other men of course They always worried just when I was in
the middle of my work and wanted me to listen to them

Did you listen

At first and they couldnt understand why I didnt care And they used
to praise my pictures and I thought they meant it I used to be proud
of the praise and tell Kami andI shall never forgetonce Kami
laughed at me

You dont like being laughed at Maisie do you

I hate it I never laugh at other people unlessunless they do
bad work Dick tell me honestly what you think of my pictures
generallyof everything of mine that youve seen

Honest honest and honest over quoted Dick from a catchword of
long ago Tell me what Kami always says

Maisie hesitated Hehe says that there is feeling in them

How dare you tell me a fib like that Remember I was under Kami for
two years I know exactly what he says

It isnt a fib

Its worse its a halftruth Kami says when he puts his head on one
sideso Il y a du sentiment mais il ny a pas de parti pris He
rolled the r threateningly as Kami used to do

Yes that is what he says and Im beginning to think that he is
right

Certainly he is Dick admitted that two people in the world could do
and say no wrong Kami was the man

And now you say the same thing Its so disheartening

Im sorry but you asked me to speak the truth Besides I love you
too much to pretend about your work Its strong its patient
sometimesnot alwaysand sometimes theres power in it but theres
no special reason why it should be done at all At least thats how it
strikes me

Theres no special reason why anything in the world should ever be
done You know that as well as I do I only want success

Youre going the wrong way to get it then Hasnt Kami ever told you
so

Dont quote Kami to me I want to know what you think My works bad
to begin with

I didnt say that and I dont think it

Its amateurish then

That it most certainly is not Youre a workwoman darling to your
bootheels and I respect you for that

You dont laugh at me behind my back

No dear You see you are more to me than any one else Put this cloak
thing round you or youll get chilled

Maisie wrapped herself in the soft marten skins turning the gray
kangaroo fur to the outside This is delicious she said rubbing her
chin thoughtfully along the fur

Well Why am I wrong in trying to get a little success

Just because you try Dont you understand darling Good work has
nothing to do withdoesnt belong tothe person who does it Its put
into him or her from outside

But how does that affect

Wait a minute All we can do is to learn how to do our work to be
masters of our materials instead of servants and never to be afraid of
anything

I understand that

Everything else comes from outside ourselves Very good If we sit down
quietly to work out notions that are sent to us we may or we may not
do something that isnt bad A great deal depends on being master of the
bricks and mortar of the trade But the instant we begin to think
about success and the effect of our workto play with one eye on the
gallerywe lose power and touch and everything else At least thats
how I have found it Instead of being quiet and giving every power
you possess to your work youre fretting over something which you can
neither help no hinder by a minute See

Its so easy for you to talk in that way People like what you do
Dont you ever think about the gallery

Much too often but Im always punished for it by loss of power Its
as simple as the Rule of Three If we make light of our work by using
it for our own ends our work will make light of us and as were the
weaker we shall suffer

I dont treat my work lightly You know that its everything to me

Of course but whether you realise it or not you give two strokes
for yourself to one for your work It isnt your fault darling I do
exactly the same thing and know that Im doing it Most of the French
schools and all the schools here drive the students to work for their
own credit and for the sake of their pride I was told that all
the world was interested in my work and everybody at Kamis talked
turpentine and I honestly believed that the world needed elevating and
influencing and all manner of impertinences by my brushes By Jove I
actually believed that When my little head was bursting with a notion
that I couldnt handle because I hadnt sufficient knowledge of my
craft I used to run about wondering at my own magnificence and getting
ready to astonish the world

But surely one can do that sometimes

Very seldom with malice aforethought darling And when its done its
such a tiny thing and the worlds so big and all but a millionth part
of it doesnt care Maisie come with me and Ill show you something of
the size of the world One can no more avoid working than eatingthat
goes on by itselfbut try to see what you are working for I know such
little heavens that I could take you toislands tucked away under the
Line You sight them after weeks of crashing through water as black as
black marble because its so deep and you sit in the forechains
day after day and see the sun rise almost afraid because the seas so
lonely

Who is afraidyou or the sun

The sun of course And there are noises under the sea and sounds
overhead in a clear sky Then you find your island alive with hot moist
orchids that make mouths at you and can do everything except talk
Theres a waterfall in it three hundred feet high just like a sliver of
green jade laced with silver and millions of wild bees live up in the
rocks and you can hear the fat cocoanuts falling from the palms and
you order an ivorywhite servant to sling you a long yellow hammock with
tassels on it like ripe maize and you put up your feet and hear the
bees hum and the water fall till you go to sleep

Can one work there

Certainly One must do something always You hang your canvas up in a
palm tree and let the parrots criticise When the scuffle you heave a
ripe custardapple at them and it bursts in a lather of cream There
are hundreds of places Come and see them

I dont quite like that place It sounds lazy Tell me another

What do you think of a big red dead city built of red sandstone
with raw green aloes growing between the stones lying out neglected on
honeycoloured sands There are forty dead kings there Maisie each in
a gorgeous tomb finer than all the others You look at the palaces and
streets and shops and tanks and think that men must live there
till you find a wee gray squirrel rubbing its nose all alone in the
marketplace and a jewelled peacock struts out of a carved doorway and
spreads its tail against a marble screen as fine pierced as pointlace
Then a monkeya little black monkeywalks through the main square to
get a drink from a tank forty feet deep He slides down the creepers to
the waters edge and a friend holds him by the tail in case he should
fall in

Is that all true

I have been there and seen Then evening comes and the lights change
till its just as though you stood in the heart of a kingopal A little
before sundown as punctually as clockwork a big bristly wild boar
with all his family following trots through the city gate churning the
foam on his tusks You climb on the shoulder of a blind black stone god
and watch that pig choose himself a palace for the night and stump in
wagging his tail Then the nightwind gets up and the sands move and
you hear the desert outside the city singing Now I lay me down to
sleep and everything is dark till the moon rises Maisie darling
come with me and see what the world is really like Its very lovely
and its very horriblebut I wont let you see anything horridand
it doesnt care your life or mine for pictures or anything else except
doing its own work and making love Come and Ill show you how to brew
sangaree and sling a hammock andoh thousands of things and youll
see for yourself what colour means and well find out together what
love means and then maybe we shall be allowed to do some good work
Come away

Why said Maisie

How can you do anything until you have seen everything or as much as
you can And besides darling I love you Come along with me You
have no business here you dont belong to this place youre half a
gipsyyour face tells that and Ieven the smell of open water makes
me restless Come across the sea and be happy

He had risen to his feet and stood in the shadow of the gun looking
down at the girl The very short winter afternoon had worn away and
before they knew the winter moon was walking the untroubled sea Long
ruled lines of silver showed where a ripple of the rising tide was
turning over the mudbanks The wind had dropped and in the intense
stillness they could hear a donkey cropping the frosty grass many yards
away A faint beating like that of a muffled drum came out of the
moonhaze

Whats that said Maisie quickly It sounds like a heart beating
Where is it

Dick was so angry at this sudden wrench to his pleadings that he could
not trust himself to speak and in this silence caught the sound Maisie
from her seat under the gun watched him with a certain amount of fear

She wished so much that he would be sensible and cease to worry her with
oversea emotion that she both could and could not understand She was
not prepared however for the change in his face as he listened

Its a steamer he saida twinscrew steamer by the beat I cant
make her out but she must be standing very close inshore Ah as the
red of a rocket streaked the haze shes standing in to signal before
she clears the Channel

Is it a wreck said Maisie to whom these words were as Greek

Dicks eyes were turned to the sea Wreck What nonsense Shes only
reporting herself Red rocket forwardtheres a green light aft now
and two red rockets from the bridge

What does that mean

Its the signal of the Cross Keys Line running to Australia I wonder
which steamer it is The note of his voice had changed he seemed to
be talking to himself and Maisie did not approve of it The moonlight
broke the haze for a moment touching the black sides of a long steamer
working down Channel Four masts and three funnelsshes in deep
draught too That must be the Barralong or the Bhutia No the Bhutia
has a clipper bow Its the Barralong to Australia Shell lift the
Southern Cross in a weeklucky old tuboh lucky old tub

He stared intently and moved up the slope of the fort to get a better
view but the mist on the sea thickened again and the beating of the
screws grew fainter Maisie called to him a little angrily and he
returned still keeping his eyes to seaward Have you ever seen the
Southern Cross blazing right over your head he asked Its superb

No she said shortly and I dont want to If you think its so
lovely why dont you go and see it yourself

She raised her face from the soft blackness of the marten skins about
her throat and her eyes shone like diamonds The moonlight on the gray
kangaroo fur turned it to frosted silver of the coldest

By Jove Maisie you look like a little heathen idol tucked up there
The eyes showed that they did not appreciate the compliment Im
sorry he continued The Southern Cross isnt worth looking at unless
someone helps you to see That steamers out of hearing

Dick she said quietly suppose I were to come to you nowbe quiet
a minutejust as I am and caring for you just as much as I do

Not as a brother though You said you didntin the Park

I never had a brother Suppose I said Take me to those places and in
time perhaps I might really care for you what would you do

Send you straight back to where you came from in a cab No I
wouldnt Id let you walk But you couldnt do it dear And I wouldnt
run the risk Youre worth waiting for till you can come without
reservation

Do you honestly believe that

I have a hazy sort of idea that I do Has it never struck you in that
light

Yees I feel so wicked about it

Wickeder than usual

You dont know all I think Its almost too awful to tell

Never mind You promised to tell me the truthat least

Its so ungrateful of me butbut though I know you care for me and
I like to have you with me IdId even sacrifice you if that would
bring me what I want

My poor little darling I know that state of mind It doesnt lead to
good work

You arent angry Remember I do despise myself

Im not exactly flatteredI had guessed as much beforebut Im not
angry Im sorry for you Surely you ought to have left a littleness
like that behind you years ago

Youve no right to patronise me I only want what I have worked for so
long It came to you without any trouble andand I dont think its
fair

What can I do Id give ten years of my life to get you what you want
But I cant help you even I cant help

A murmur of dissent from Maisie He went onAnd I know by what you
have just said that youre on the wrong road to success It isnt got
at by sacrificing other peopleIve had that much knocked into me
you must sacrifice yourself and live under orders and never think for
yourself and never have real satisfaction in your work except just at
the beginning when youre reaching out after a notion

How can you believe all that

Theres no question of belief or disbelief Thats the law and you
take it or refuse it as you please I try to obey but I cant and
then my work turns bad on my hands Under any circumstances remember
fourfifths of everybodys work must be bad But the remnant is worth
the trouble for its own sake

Isnt it nice to get credit even for bad work

Its much too nice ButMay I tell you something It isnt a pretty
tale but youre so like a man that I forget when Im talking to you

Tell me

Once when I was out in the Soudan I went over some ground that we had
been fighting on for three days There were twelve hundred dead and we
hadnt time to bury them

How ghastly

I had been at work on a big doublesheet sketch and I was wondering
what people would think of it at home The sight of that field taught
me a good deal It looked just like a bed of horrible toadstools in all
colours andId never seen men in bulk go back to their beginnings
before So I began to understand that men and women were only material
to work with and that what they said or did was of no consequence
See Strictly speaking you might just as well put your ear down to the
palette to catch what your colours are saying

Dick thats disgraceful

Wait a minute I said strictly speaking Unfortunately everybody must
be either a man or a woman

Im glad you allow that much

In your case I dont You arent a woman But ordinary people Maisie
must behave and work as such Thats what makes me so savage He hurled
a pebble towards the sea as he spoke I know that it is outside my
business to care what people say I can see that it spoils my output
if I listen to em and yet confound it allanother pebble flew
seawardI cant help purring when Im rubbed the right way Even when
I can see on a mans forehead that he is lying his way through a clump
of pretty speeches those lies make me happy and play the mischief with
my hand

And when he doesnt say pretty things

Then belovedestDick grinnedI forget that I am the steward of
these gifts and I want to make that man love and appreciate my work
with a thick stick Its too humiliating altogether but I suppose even
if one were an angel and painted humans altogether from outside one
would lose in touch what one gained in grip

Maisie laughed at the idea of Dick as an angel

But you seem to think she said that everything nice spoils your
hand

I dont think Its the lawjust the same as it was at Mrs
Jennetts Everything that is nice does spoil your hand Im glad you
see so clearly

I dont like the view

Nor I Buthave got orders what can do Are you strong enough to face
it alone

I suppose I must

Let me help darling We can hold each other very tight and try to
walk straight We shall blunder horribly but it will be better than
stumbling apart Maisie cant you see reason

I dont think we should get on together We should be two of a trade
so we should never agree

How I should like to meet the man who made that proverb He lived in a
cave and ate raw bear I fancy Id make him chew his own arrowheads
Well

I should be only half married to you I should worry and fuss about my
work as I do now Four days out of the seven Im not fit to speak to

You talk as if no one else in the world had ever used a brush
Dyou suppose that I dont know the feeling of worry and bother and
cantgetatness Youre lucky if you only have it four days out of the
seven What difference would that make

A great dealif you had it too

Yes but I could respect it Another man might not He might laugh at
you But theres no use talking about it If you can think in that way
you cant care for meyet

The tide had nearly covered the mudbanks and twenty little ripples
broke on the beach before Maisie chose to speak

Dick she said slowly I believe very much that you are better than I
am

This doesnt seem to bear on the argumentbut in what way

I dont quite know but in what you said about work and things and
then youre so patient Yes youre better than I am

Dick considered rapidly the murkiness of an average mans life There
was nothing in the review to fill him with a sense of virtue He lifted
the hem of the cloak to his lips

Why said Maisie making as though she had not noticed can you see
things that I cant I dont believe what you believe but youre right
I believe

If Ive seen anything God knows I couldnt have seen it but for you
and I know that I couldnt have said it except to you You seemed to
make everything clear for a minute but I dont practice what I preach
You would help me There are only us two in the world for all
purposes andand you like to have me with you

Of course I do I wonder if you can realise how utterly lonely I am

Darling I think I can

Two years ago when I first took the little house I used to walk up
and down the backgarden trying to cry I never can cry Can you

Its some time since I tried What was the trouble Overwork

I dont know but I used to dream that I had broken down and had no
money and was starving in London I thought about it all day and it
frightened meoh how it frightened me

I know that fear Its the most terrible of all It wakes me up in the
night sometimes You oughtnt to know anything about it

How do you know

Never mind Is your three hundred a year safe

Its in Consols

Very well If any one comes to you and recommends a better
investmenteven if I should come to youdont you listen Never
shift the money for a minute and never lend a penny of iteven to the
redhaired girl

Dont scold me so Im not likely to be foolish

The earth is full of men whod sell their souls for three hundred a
year and women come and talk and borrow a fivepound note here and
a tenpound note there and a woman has no conscience in a money debt
Stick to your money Maisie for theres nothing more ghastly in the
world than poverty in London Its scared me By Jove it put the fear
into me And one oughtnt to be afraid of anything

To each man is appointed his particular dreadthe terror that if he
does not fight against it must cow him even to the loss of his manhood
Dicks experience of the sordid misery of want had entered into the
deeps of him and lest he might find virtue too easy that memory stood
behind him tempting to shame when dealers came to buy his wares As
the Nilghai quaked against his will at the still green water of a lake
or a milldam as Torpenhow flinched before any white arm that could cut
or stab and loathed himself for flinching Dick feared the poverty he
had once tasted half in jest His burden was heavier than the burdens of
his companions

Maisie watched the face working in the moonlight

Youve plenty of pennies now she said soothingly

I shall never have enough he began with vicious emphasis Then
laughing I shall always be threepence short in my accounts

Why threepence

I carried a mans bag once from Liverpool Street Station to
Blackfriars Bridge It was a sixpenny jobyou neednt laugh indeed
it wasand I wanted the money desperately He only gave me threepence
and he hadnt even the decency to pay in silver Whatever money I make
I shall never get that odd threepence out of the world

This was not language befitting the man who had preached of the sanctity
of work It jarred on Maisie who preferred her payment in applause
which since all men desire it must be of the right She hunted for her
little purse and gravely took out a threepenny bit

There it is she said Ill pay you Dickie and dont worry any
more it isnt worth while Are you paid

I am said the very human apostle of fair craft taking the coin Im
paid a thousand times and well close that account It shall live on my
watchchain and youre an angel Maisie

Im very cramped and Im feeling a little cold Good gracious the
cloak is all white and so is your moustache I never knew it was so
chilly

A light frost lay white on the shoulder of Dicks ulster He too had
forgotten the state of the weather They laughed together and with that
laugh ended all serious discourse

They ran inland across the waste to warm themselves then turned to look
at the glory of the full tide under the moonlight and the intense black
shadows of the furze bushes It was an additional joy to Dick that
Maisie could see colour even as he saw itcould see the blue in the
white of the mist the violet that is in gray palings and all things
else as they arenot of one hue but a thousand And the moonlight
came into Maisies soul so that she usually reserved chattered of
herself and of the things she took interest inof Kami wisest of
teachers and of the girls in the studioof the Poles who will kill
themselves with overwork if they are not checked of the French who
talk at great length of much more than they will ever accomplish of
the slovenly English who toil hopelessly and cannot understand that
inclination does not imply power of the Americans whose rasping
voices in the hush of a hot afternoon strain tensedrawn nerves to
breakingpoint and whose suppers lead to indigestion of tempestuous
Russians neither to hold nor to bind who tell the girls ghoststories
till the girls shriek of stolid Germans who come to learn one thing
and having mastered that much stolidly go away and copy pictures for
evermore Dick listened enraptured because it was Maisie who spoke He
knew the old life

It hasnt changed much he said Do they still steal colours at
lunchtime

Not steal Attract is the word Of course they do Im goodI only
attract ultramarine but there are students whod attract flakewhite

Ive done it myself You cant help it when the palettes are hung up
Every colour is common property once it runs downeven though you
do start it with a drop of oil It teaches people not to waste their
tubes

I should like to attract some of your colours Dick Perhaps I might
catch your success with them

I mustnt say a bad word but I should like to What in the world
which youve just missed a lovely chance of seeing does success or want
of success or a threestoried success matter compared withNo I
wont open that question again Its time to go back to town

Im sorry Dick but

Youre much more interested in that than you are in me

I dont know I dont think I am

What will you give me if I tell you a sure shortcut to everything you
wantthe trouble and the fuss and the tangle and all the rest Will
you promise to obey me

Of course

In the first place you must never forget a meal because you happen
to be at work You forgot your lunch twice last week said Dick at a
venture for he knew with whom he was dealing

No noonly once really

Thats bad enough And you mustnt take a cup of tea and a biscuit in
place of a regular dinner because dinner happens to be a trouble

Youre making fun of me

I never was more in earnest in my life Oh my love my love hasnt
it dawned on you yet what you are to me Heres the whole earth in a
conspiracy to give you a chill or run over you or drench you to the
skin or cheat you out of your money or let you die of overwork and
underfeeding and I havent the mere right to look after you Why I
dont even know if you have sense enough to put on warm things when the
weathers cold

Dick youre the most awful boy to talk toreally How do you suppose
I managed when you were away

I wasnt here and I didnt know But now Im back Id give everything
I have for the right of telling you to come in out of the rain

Your success too

This time it cost Dick a severe struggle to refrain from bad words

As Mrs Jennett used to say youre a trial Maisie Youve been cooped
up in the schools too long and you think every one is looking at you
There arent twelve hundred people in the world who understand pictures
The others pretend and dont care Remember Ive seen twelve hundred
men dead in toadstoolbeds Its only the voice of the tiniest little
fraction of people that makes success The real world doesnt care a
tinkersdoesnt care a bit For aught you or I know every man in the
world may be arguing with a Maisie of his own

Poor Maisie

Poor Dick I think Do you believe while hes fighting for whats
dearer than his life he wants to look at a picture And even if he did
and if all the world did and a thousand million people rose up and
shouted hymns to my honour and glory would that make up to me for the
knowledge that you were out shopping in the Edgware Road on a rainy day
without an umbrella Now well go to the station

But you said on the beach persisted Maisie with a certain fear

Dick groaned aloud Yes I know what I said My work is everything I
have or am or hope to be to me and I believe Ive learnt the law
that governs it but Ive some lingering sense of fun leftthough
youve nearly knocked it out of me I can just see that it isnt
everything to all the world Do what I say and not what I do

Maisie was careful not to reopen debatable matters and they returned to
London joyously The terminus stopped Dick in the midst of an eloquent
harangue on the beauties of exercise He would buy Maisie a horsesuch
a horse as never yet bowed head to bitwould stable it with a
companion some twenty miles from London and Maisie solely for her
healths sake should ride with him twice or thrice a week

Thats absurd said she It wouldnt be proper

Now who in all London tonight would have sufficient interest or
audacity to call us two to account for anything we chose to do

Maisie looked at the lamps the fog and the hideous turmoil Dick was
right but horseflesh did not make for Art as she understood it

Youre very nice sometimes but youre very foolish more times Im not
going to let you give me horses or take you out of your way tonight
Ill go home by myself Only I want you to promise me something You
wont think any more about that extra threepence will you Remember
youve been paid and I wont allow you to be spiteful and do bad work
for a little thing like that You can be so big that you mustnt be
tiny

This was turning the tables with a vengeance There remained only to put
Maisie into her hansom

Goodbye she said simply Youll come on Sunday It has been a
beautiful day Dick Why cant it be like this always

Because loves like linework you must go forward or backward you
cant stand still By the way go on with your linework Good night
and for myfor my sake take care of yourself

He turned to walk home meditating The day had brought him nothing that
he hoped for butsurely this was worth many daysit had brought him
nearer to Maisie The end was only a question of time now and the prize
well worth the waiting By instinct once more he turned to the river

And she understood at once he said looking at the water She found
out my pet besetting sin on the spot and paid it off My God how she
understood And she said I was better than she was Better than she
was He laughed at the absurdity of the notion I wonder if girls
guess at onehalf a mans life They cant orthey wouldnt marry us
He took her gift out of his pocket and considered it in the light of a
miracle and a pledge of the comprehension that one day would lead to
perfect happiness Meantime Maisie was alone in London with none to
save her from danger And the packed wilderness was very full of danger

Dick made his prayer to Fate disjointedly after the manner of the
heathen as he threw the piece of silver into the river If any evil were
to befal let him bear the burden and let Maisie go unscathed since
the threepenny piece was dearest to him of all his possessions It was
a small coin in itself but Maisie had given it and the Thames held it
and surely the Fates would be bribed for this once

The drowning of the coin seemed to cut him free from thought of Maisie
for the moment He took himself off the bridge and went whistling to his
chambers with a strong yearning for some mantalk and tobacco after his
first experience of an entire day spent in the society of a woman
There was a stronger desire at his heart when there rose before him an
unsolicited vision of the Barralong dipping deep and sailing free for
the Southern Cross



CHAPTER VIII

 And these two as I have told you
 Were the friends of Hiawatha
 Chibiabos the musician
 And the very strong man Kwasind
 Hiawatha

Torpenhow was paging the last sheets of some manuscript while the
Nilghai who had come for chess and remained to talk tactics was
reading through the first part commenting scornfully the while

Its picturesque enough and its sketchy said he but as a serious
consideration of affairs in Eastern Europe its not worth much

Its off my hands at any rate Thirtyseven thirtyeight
thirtynine slips altogether arent there That should make between
eleven and twelve pages of valuable misinformation Heighho Torpenhow
shuffled the writing together and hummed

 Young lambs to sell young lambs to sell
 If Id as much money as I could tell
 I never would cry Young lambs to sell

Dick entered selfconscious and a little defiant but in the best of
tempers with all the world

Back at last said Torpenhow

More or less What have you been doing

Work Dickie you behave as though the Bank of England were behind you
Heres Sunday Monday and Tuesday gone and you havent done a line
Its scandalous

The notions come and go my childrenthey come and go like our
baccy he answered filling his pipe Moreover he stooped to thrust
a spill into the grate Apollo does not always stretch hisOh
confound your clumsy jests Nilghai

This is not the place to preach the theory of direct inspiration
said the Nilghai returning Torpenhows large and workmanlike bellows to
their nail on the wall We believe in cobblers wax Lawhere you sit
down

If you werent so big and fat said Dick looking round for a weapon
Id

No skylarking in my rooms You two smashed half my furniture last time
you threw the cushions about You might have the decency to say How
dyou do to Binkie Look at him

Binkie had jumped down from the sofa and was fawning round Dicks knee
and scratching at his boots

Dear man said Dick snatching him up and kissing him on the black
patch above his right eye Did ums was Binks Did that ugly Nilghai
turn you off the sofa Bite him Mr Binkie He pitched him on the
Nilghais stomach as the big man lay at ease and Binkie pretended to
destroy the Nilghai inch by inch till a sofa cushion extinguished him
and panting he stuck out his tongue at the company

The Binkieboy went for a walk this morning before you were up Torp I
saw him making love to the butcher at the corner when the shutters were
being taken downjust as if he hadnt enough to eat in his own proper
house said Dick

Binks is that a true bill said Torpenhow severely The little dog
retreated under the sofa cushion and showed by the fat white back of
him that he really had no further interest in the discussion

Strikes me that another disreputable dog went for a walk too said
the Nilghai What made you get up so early Torp said you might be
buying a horse

He knows it would need three of us for a serious business like that
No I felt lonesome and unhappy so I went out to look at the sea and
watch the pretty ships go by

Where did you go

Somewhere on the Channel Progly or Snigly or some wateringplace was
its name Ive forgotten but it was only two hours run from London and
the ships went by

Did you see anything you knew

Only the Barralong outwards to Australia and an Odessa grainboat
loaded down by the head It was a thick day but the sea smelt good

Wherefore put on ones best trousers to see the Barralong said
Torpenhow pointing

Because Ive nothing except these things and my painting duds Besides
I wanted to do honour to the sea

Did She make you feel restless asked the Nilghai keenly

Crazy Dont speak of it Im sorry I went

Torpenhow and the Nilghai exchanged a look as Dick stooping busied
himself among the formers boots and trees

These will do he said at last I cant say I think much of your
taste in slippers but the fits the thing He slipped his feet into a
pair of socklike sambhurskin foot coverings found a long chair and
lay at length

Theyre my own pet pair Torpenhow said I was just going to put them
on myself

All your reprehensible selfishness Just because you see me happy for a
minute you want to worry me and stir me up Find another pair

Good for you that Dick cant wear your clothes Torp You two live
communistically said the Nilghai

Dick never has anything that I can wear Hes only useful to sponge
upon

Confound you have you been rummaging round among my clothes then
said Dick I put a sovereign in the tobaccojar yesterday How do you
expect a man to keep his accounts properly if you

Here the Nilghai began to laugh and Torpenhow joined him

Hid a sovereign yesterday Youre no sort of financier You lent me a
fiver about a month back Do you remember Torpenhow said

Yes of course

Do you remember that I paid it you ten days later and you put it at
the bottom of the tobacco

By Jove did I I thought it was in one of my colourboxes

You thought About a week ago I went into your studio to get some
baccy and found it

What did you do with it

Took the Nilghai to a theatre and fed him

You couldnt feed the Nilghai under twice the moneynot though you
gave him Army beef Well I suppose I should have found it out sooner or
later What is there to laugh at

Youre a most amazing cuckoo in many directions said the Nilghai
still chuckling over the thought of the dinner Never mind We had both
been working very hard and it was your unearned increment we spent and
as youre only a loafer it didnt matter

Thats pleasantfrom the man who is bursting with my meat too Ill
get that dinner back one of these days Suppose we go to a theatre now

Put our boots onand dressand wash The Nilghai spoke very
lazily

I withdraw the motion

Suppose just for a changeas a startling variety you knowwe that
is to say we get our charcoal and our canvas and go on with our work

Torpenhow spoke pointedly but Dick only wriggled his toes inside the
soft leather moccasins

What a oneideaed clucker that is If I had any unfinished figures on
hand I havent any model if I had my model I havent any spray and I
never leave charcoal unfixed overnight and if I had my spray and twenty
photographs of backgrounds I couldnt do anything tonight I dont feel
that way

Binkiedog hes a lazy hog isnt he said the Nilghai

Very good I will do some work said Dick rising swiftly Ill fetch
the Nungapunga Book and well add another picture to the Nilghai Saga

Arent you worrying him a little too much asked the Nilghai when
Dick had left the room

Perhaps but I know what he can turn out if he likes It makes me
savage to hear him praised for past work when I know what he ought to
do You and I are arranged for

By Kismet and our own powers mores the pity I have dreamed of a good
deal

So have I but we know our limitations now Im dashed if I know what
Dicks may be when he gives himself to his work Thats what makes me so
keen about him

And when alls said and done you will be put asidequite rightlyfor
a female girl

I wonder Where do you think he has been today

To the sea Didnt you see the look in his eyes when he talked about
her Hes as restless as a swallow in autumn

Yes but did he go alone

I dont know and I dont care but he has the beginnings of the
gofever upon him He wants to upstakes and move out Theres no
mistaking the signs Whatever he may have said before he has the call
upon him now

It might be his salvation Torpenhow said

Perhapsif you care to take the responsibility of being a saviour

Dick returned with the big clasped sketchbook that the Nilghai knew
well and did not love too much In it Dick had drawn all manner of
moving incidents experienced by himself or related to him by the
others of all the four corners of the earth But the wider range of the
Nilghais body and life attracted him most When truth failed he
fell back on fiction of the wildest and represented incidents in the
Nilghais career that were unseemlyhis marriages with many African
princesses his shameless betrayal for Arab wives of an army corps to
the Mahdi his tattooment by skilled operators in Burmah his
interview and his fears with the yellow headsman in the bloodstained
executionground of Canton and finally the passings of his spirit into
the bodies of whales elephants and toucans Torpenhow from time to
time had added rhymed descriptions and the whole was a curious piece of
art because Dick decided having regard to the name of the book which
being interpreted means naked that it would be wrong to draw the
Nilghai with any clothes on under any circumstances Consequently the
last sketch representing that muchenduring man calling on the War
Office to press his claims to the Egyptian medal was hardly delicate
He settled himself comfortably on Torpenhows table and turned over the
pages

What a fortune you would have been to Blake Nilghai he said
Theres a succulent pinkness about some of these sketches thats
more than lifelike The Nilghai surrounded while bathing by the
Mahdiehthat was founded on fact eh

It was very nearly my last bath you irreverent dauber Has Binkie come
into the Saga yet

No the Binkieboy hasnt done anything except eat and kill cats
Lets see Here you are as a stainedglass saint in a church Deuced
decorative lines about your anatomy you ought to be grateful for being
handed down to posterity in this way Fifty years hence youll exist in
rare and curious facsimiles at ten guineas each What shall I try this
time The domestic life of the Nilghai

Hasnt got any

The undomestic life of the Nilghai then Of course Massmeeting of
his wives in Trafalgar Square Thats it They came from the ends of the
earth to attend Nilghais wedding to an English bride This shall be an
epic Its a sweet material to work with

Its a scandalous waste of time said Torpenhow

Dont worry it keeps ones hand inspecially when you begin without
the pencil He set to work rapidly Thats Nelsons Column Presently
the Nilghai will appear shinning up it

Give him some clothes this time

Certainlya veil and an orangewreath because hes been married

Gad thats clever enough said Torpenhow over his shoulder as Dick
brought out of the paper with three twirls of the brush a very fat back
and labouring shoulder pressed against stone

Just imagine Dick continued if we could publish a few of these dear
little things every time the Nilghai subsidises a man who can write to
give the public an honest opinion of my pictures

Well youll admit I always tell you when I have done anything of that
kind I know I cant hammer you as you ought to be hammered so I give
the job to another Young Maclagan for instance

Nooone halfminute old man stick your hand out against the dark of
the wallpaperyou only burble and call me names That left shoulders
out of drawing I must literally throw a veil over that Wheres my
penknife Well what about Maclagan

I only gave him his ridingorders toto lambast you on general
principles for not producing work that will last

Whereupon that young foolDick threw back his head and shut one
eye as he shifted the page under his handbeing left alone with an
inkpot and what he conceived were his own notions went and spilt them
both over me in the papers You might have engaged a grown man for the
business Nilghai How do you think the bridal veil looks now Torp

How the deuce do three dabs and two scratches make the stuff stand away
from the body as it does said Torpenhow to whom Dicks methods were
always new

It just depends on where you put em If Maclagan had know that much
about his business he might have done better

Why dont you put the damned dabs into something that will stay then
insisted the Nilghai who had really taken considerable trouble in
hiring for Dicks benefit the pen of a young gentleman who devoted most
of his waking hours to an anxious consideration of the aims and ends of
Art which he wrote was one and indivisible

Wait a minute till I see how I am going to manage my procession of
wives You seem to have married extensively and I must rough em in
with the pencilMedes Parthians Edomites Now setting
aside the weakness and the wickedness andand the fatheadedness of
deliberately trying to do work that will live as they call it Im
content with the knowledge that Ive done my best up to date and I
shant do anything like it again for some hours at leastprobably
years Most probably never

What any stuff you have in stock your best work said Torpenhow

Anything youve sold said the Nilghai

Oh no It isnt here and it isnt sold Better than that it cant be
sold and I dont think any one knows where it is Im sure I dont
And yet more and more wives on the north side of the square Observe
the virtuous horror of the lions

You may as well explain said Torpenhow and Dick lifted his head from
the paper

The sea reminded me of it he said slowly I wish it hadnt It
weighs some few thousand tonsunless you cut it out with a cold
chisel

Dont be an idiot You cant pose with us here said the Nilghai

Theres no pose in the matter at all Its a fact I was loafing from
Lima to Auckland in a big old condemned passengership turned into
a cargoboat and owned by a secondhand Italian firm She was a crazy
basket We were cut down to fifteen ton of coal a day and we thought
ourselves lucky when we kicked seven knots an hour out of her Then
we used to stop and let the bearings cool down and wonder whether the
crack in the shaft was spreading

Were you a steward or a stoker in those days

I was flush for the time being so I was a passenger or else I
should have been a steward I think said Dick with perfect gravity
returning to the procession of angry wives I was the only other
passenger from Lima and the ship was half empty and full of rats and
cockroaches and scorpions

But what has this to do with the picture

Wait a minute She had been in the China passenger trade and her lower
decks had bunks for two thousand pigtails Those were all taken down
and she was empty up to her nose and the lights came through the port
holesmost annoying lights to work in till you got used to them I
hadnt anything to do for weeks The ships charts were in pieces and
our skipper darent run south for fear of catching a storm So he did
his best to knock all the Society Islands out of the water one by one
and I went into the lower deck and did my picture on the port side as
far forward in her as I could go There was some brown paint and some
green paint that they used for the boats and some black paint for
ironwork and that was all I had

The passengers must have thought you mad

There was only one and it was a woman but it gave me the notion of my
picture

What was she like said Torpenhow

She was a sort of NegroidJewessCuban with morals to match She
couldnt read or write and she didnt want to but she used to come
down and watch me paint and the skipper didnt like it because he was
paying her passage and had to be on the bridge occasionally

I see That must have been cheerful

It was the best time I ever had To begin with we didnt know whether
we should go up or go down any minute when there was a sea on and when
it was calm it was paradise and the woman used to mix the paints
and talk broken English and the skipper used to steal down every few
minutes to the lower deck because he said he was afraid of fire
So you see we could never tell when we might be caught and I had a
splendid notion to work out in only three keys of colour

What was the notion

Two lines in Poe

 Neither the angels in Heaven above nor the demons down under the sea
 Can ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful Annabel Lee

It came out of the seaall by itself I drew that fight fought out in
green water over the naked choking soul and the woman served as the
model for the devils and the angels bothseadevils and seaangels
and the soul half drowned between them It doesnt sound much but when
there was a good light on the lower deck it looked very fine and creepy
It was seven by fourteen feet all done in shifting light for shifting
light

Did the woman inspire you much said Torpenhow

She and the sea between themimmensely There was a heap of bad
drawing in that picture I remember I went out of my way to foreshorten
for sheer delight of doing it and I foreshortened damnably but for all
that its the best thing Ive ever done and now I suppose the ships
broken up or gone down Whew What a time that was

What happened after all

It all ended They were loading her with wool when I left the ship but
even the stevedores kept the picture clear to the last The eyes of the
demons scared them I honestly believe

And the woman

She was scared too when it was finished She used to cross herself
before she went down to look at it Just three colours and no chance of
getting any more and the sea outside and unlimited lovemaking inside
and the fear of death atop of everything else O Lord He had ceased to
look at the sketch but was staring straight in front of him across the
room

Why dont you try something of the same kind now said the Nilghai

Because those things come not by fasting and prayer When I find a
cargoboat and a JewessCuban and another notion and the same old life
I may

You wont find them here said the Nilghai

No I shall not Dick shut the sketchbook with a bang This rooms
as hot as an oven Open the window some one

He leaned into the darkness watching the greater darkness of London
below him The chambers stood much higher than the other houses
commanding a hundred chimneyscrooked cowls that looked like sitting
cats as they swung round and other uncouth brick and zinc mysteries
supported by iron stanchions and clamped by 8pieces Northward the
lights of Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square threw a coppercoloured
glare above the black roofs and southward by all the orderly lights of
the Thames A train rolled out across one of the railway bridges and
its thunder drowned for a minute the dull roar of the streets The
Nilghai looked at his watch and said shortly Thats the Paris
nightmail You can book from here to St Petersburg if you choose

Dick crammed head and shoulders out of the window and looked across the
river Torpenhow came to his side while the Nilghai passed over quietly
to the piano and opened it Binkie making himself as large as possible
spread out upon the sofa with the air of one who is not to be lightly
disturbed

Well said the Nilghai to the two pairs of shoulders have you never
seen this place before

A steamtug on the river hooted as she towed her barges to wharf Then
the boom of the traffic came into the room Torpenhow nudged Dick

Good place to bank inbad place to bunk in Dickie isnt it

Dicks chin was in his hand as he answered in the words of a general
not without fame still looking out on the darknessMy God what a
city to loot

Binkie found the night air tickling his whiskers and sneezed
plaintively

We shall give the Binkiedog a cold said Torpenhow Come in and
they withdrew their heads Youll be buried in Kensal Green Dick
one of these days if it isnt closed by the time you want to go
thereburied within two feet of some one else his wife and his
family

Allah forbid I shall get away before that time comes Give a man room
to stretch his legs Mr Binkie Dick flung himself down on the sofa
and tweaked Binkies velvet ears yawning heavily the while

Youll find that wardrobecase very much out of tune Torpenhow said
to the Nilghai Its never touched except by you

A piece of gross extravagance Dick grunted The Nilghai only comes
when Im out

Thats because youre always out Howl Nilghai and let him hear

The life of the Nilghai is fraud and slaughter His writings are
watered Dickens and water But the voice of the Nilghai raised on high
Makes even the Mahdieh glad to die

Dick quoted from Torpenhows letterpress in the Nungapunga Book

How do they call moose in Canada Nilghai

The man laughed Singing was his one polite accomplishment as many
Presstents in faroff lands had known

What shall I sing said he turning in the chair

Moll Roe in the Morning said Torpenhow at a venture

No said Dick sharply and the Nilghai opened his eyes The old
chanty whereof he among a very few possessed all the words was not
a pretty one but Dick had heard it many times before without wincing
Without prelude he launched into that stately tune that calls together
and troubles the hearts of the gipsies of the sea

Farewell and adieu to you Spanish ladies Farewell and adieu to you
ladies of Spain

Dick turned uneasily on the sofa for he could hear the bows of the
Barralong crashing into the green seas on her way to the Southern Cross

Then came the chorus

Well rant and well roar like true British sailors Well rant and
well roar across the salt seas Until we take soundings in the Channel
of Old England From Ushant to Scilly tis fortyfive leagues

Thirtyfivethirtyfive said Dick petulantly Dont tamper with
Holy Writ Go on Nilghai

The first land we made it was called the Deadman and they sang to the
end very vigourously

That would be a better song if her head were turned the other wayto
the Ushant light for instance said the Nilghai

Flinging his arms about like a mad windmill said Torpenhow Give us
something else Nilghai Youre in fine foghorn form tonight

Give us the Ganges Pilot you sang that in the square the night
before ElMaghrib By the way I wonder how many of the chorus are alive
tonight said Dick

Torpenhow considered for a minute By Jove I believe only you and I
Raynor Vicery and Deenesall dead Vincent caught smallpox in Cairo
carried it here and died of it Yes only you and I and the Nilghai

Umph And yet the men here whove done their work in a wellwarmed
studio all their lives with a policeman at each corner say that I
charge too much for my pictures

They are buying your work not your insurance policies dear child
said the Nilghai

I gambled with one to get at the other Dont preach Go on with the
Pilot Where in the world did you get that song

On a tombstone said the Nilghai On a tombstone in a distant land I
made it an accompaniment with heaps of base chords

Oh Vanity Begin And the Nilghai began

I have slipped my cable messmates Im drifting down with the tide I
have my sailing orders while yet at anchor ride And never on fair June
morning have I put out to sea With clearer conscience or better hope or
a heart more light and free

Shoulder to shoulder Joe my boy into the crowd like a wedge Strike
with the hangers messmates but do not cut with the edge Cries
Charnock Scatter the faggots double that Brahmin in two The tall
pale widow for me Joe the little brown girl for you

Young Joe youre nearing sixty why is your hide so dark Katie has
soft fair blue eyes who blackened yoursWhy hark

They were all singing now Dick with the roar of the wind of the open
sea about his ears as the deep bass voice let itself go

The morning gunHo steady the arquebuses to me I ha sounded the
Dutch High Admirals heart as my lead doth sound the sea

Sounding sounding the Ganges floating down with the tide Moore me
close to Charnock next to my nutbrown bride My blessing to Kate
at FairlightHolwell my thanks to you Steady We steer for heaven
through sanddrifts cold and blue

Now what is there in that nonsense to make a man restless said Dick
hauling Binkie from his feet to his chest

It depends on the man said Torpenhow

The man who has been down to look at the sea said the Nilghai

I didnt know she was going to upset me in this fashion

Thats what men say when they go to say goodbye to a woman Its more
easy though to get rid of three women than a piece of ones life and
surroundings

But a woman can be began Dick unguardedly

A piece of ones life continued Torpenhow No she cant His face
darkened for a moment She says she wants to sympathise with you and
help you in your work and everything else that clearly a man must
do for himself Then she sends round five notes a day to ask why the
dickens you havent been wasting your time with her

Dont generalise said the Nilghai By the time you arrive at
five notes a day you must have gone through a good deal and behaved
accordingly Shouldnt begin these things my son

I shouldnt have gone down to the sea said Dick just a little
anxious to change the conversation And you shouldnt have sung

The sea isnt sending you five notes a day said the Nilghai

No but Im fatally compromised Shes an enduring old hag and
Im sorry I ever met her Why wasnt I born and bred and dead in a
threepair back

Hear him blaspheming his first love Why in the world shouldnt you
listen to her said Torpenhow

Before Dick could reply the Nilghai lifted up his voice with a shout
that shook the windows in The Men of the Sea that begins as all
know The sea is a wicked old woman and after wading through eight
lines whose imagery is truthful ends in a refrain slow as the clacking
of a capstan when the boat comes unwillingly up to the bars where the
men sweat and tramp in the shingle

Ye that bore us O restore us She is kinder than ye For the call is
on our heartstrings Said The Men of the Sea

The Nilghai sang that verse twice with simple cunning intending that
Dick should hear But Dick was waiting for the farewell of the men to
their wives

Ye that love us can ye move us She is dearer than ye And your sleep
will be the sweeter Said The Men of the Sea

The rough words beat like the blows of the waves on the bows of the
rickety boat from Lima in the days when Dick was mixing paints making
love drawing devils and angels in the half dark and wondering whether
the next minute would put the Italian captains knife between his
shoulderblades And the gofever which is more real than many doctors
diseases waked and raged urging him who loved Maisie beyond anything
in the world to go away and taste the old hot unregenerate life
againto scuffle swear gamble and love light loves with his
fellows to take ship and know the sea once more and by her beget
pictures to talk to Binat among the sands of Port Said while Yellow
Tina mixed the drinks to hear the crackle of musketry and see the
smoke roll outward thin and thicken again till the shining black faces
came through and in that hell every man was strictly responsible for
his own head and his own alone and struck with an unfettered arm It
was impossible utterly impossible but

Oh our fathers in the churchyard She is older than ye And our
graves will be the greener Said The Men of the Sea

What is there to hinder said Torpenhow in the long hush that
followed the song

You said a little time since that you wouldnt come for a walk round
the world Torp

That was months ago and I only objected to your making money for
travelling expenses Youve shot your bolt here and it has gone home Go
away and do some work and see some things

Get some of the fat off you youre disgracefully out of condition
said the Nilghai making a plunge from the chair and grasping a handful
of Dick generally over the right ribs Soft as puttypure tallow born
of overfeeding Train it off Dickie

Were all equally gross Nilghai Next time you have to take the field
youll sit down wink your eyes gasp and die in a fit

Never mind You go away on a ship Go to Lima again or to Brazil
Theres always trouble in South America

Do you suppose I want to be told where to go Great Heavens the only
difficulty is to know where Im to stop But I shall stay here as I
told you before

Then youll be buried in Kensal Green and turn into adipocere with the
others said Torpenhow Are you thinking of commissions in hand Pay
forfeit and go Youve money enough to travel as a king if you please

Youve the grisliest notions of amusement Torp I think I see myself
shipping first class on a sixthousandton hotel and asking the third
engineer what makes the engines go round and whether it isnt very warm
in the stokehold Ho ho I should ship as a loafer if ever I shipped at
all which Im not going to do I shall compromise and go for a small
trip to begin with

Thats something at any rate Where will you go said Torpenhow It
would do you all the good in the world old man

The Nilghai saw the twinkle in Dicks eye and refrained from speech

I shall go in the first place to Rathrays stable where I shall hire
one horse and take him very carefully as far as Richmond Hill Then I
shall walk him back again in case he should accidentally burst into a
lather and make Rathray angry I shall do that tomorrow for the sake of
air and exercise

Bah Dick had barely time to throw up his arm and ward off the cushion
that the disgusted Torpenhow heaved at his head

Air and exercise indeed said the Nilghai sitting down heavily on
Dick

Lets give him a little of both Get the bellows Torp

At this point the conference broke up in disorder because Dick would
not open his mouth till the Nilghai held his nose fast and there was
some trouble in forcing the nozzle of the bellows between his teeth and
even when it was there he weakly tried to puff against the force of
the blast and his cheeks blew up with a great explosion and the enemy
becoming helpless with laughter he so beat them over the head with a
soft sofa cushion that became unsewn and distributed its feathers
and Binkie interfering in Torpenhows interests was bundled into the
halfempty bag and advised to scratch his way out which he did after
a while travelling rapidly up and down the floor in the shape of an
agitated green haggis and when he came out looking for satisfaction
the three pillars of his world were picking feathers out of their hair

A prophet has no honour in his own country said Dick ruefully
dusting his knees This filthy fluff will never brush off my legs

It was all for your own good said the Nilghai Nothing like air and
exercise

All for your good said Torpenhow not in the least with reference to
past clowning It would let you focus things at their proper worth and
prevent your becoming slack in this hothouse of a town Indeed it would
old man I shouldnt have spoken if I hadnt thought so Only you make
a joke of everything

Before God I do no such thing said Dick quickly and earnestly You
dont know me if you think that

I dont think it said the Nilghai

How can fellows like ourselves who know what life and death really
mean dare to make a joke of anything I know we pretend it to save
ourselves from breaking down or going to the other extreme Cant I see
old man how youre always anxious about me and try to advise me to
make my work better Do you suppose I dont think about that myself But
you cant help meyou cant help menot even you I must play my own
hand alone in my own way

Hear hear from the Nilghai

Whats the one thing in the Nilghai Saga that Ive never drawn in
the Nungapunga Book Dick continued to Torpenhow who was a little
astonished at the outburst

Now there was one blank page in the book given over to the sketch that
Dick had not drawn of the crowning exploit in the Nilghais life when
that man being young and forgetting that his body and bones belonged to
the paper that employed him had ridden over sunburned slippery grass
in the rear of Bredows brigade on the day that the troopers flung
themselves at Cauroberts artillery and for aught they knew twenty
battalions in front to save the battered 24th German Infantry to give
time to decide the fate of Vionville and to learn ere their remnant
came back to Flavigay that cavalry can attack and crumple and break
unshaken infantry Whenever he was inclined to think over a life that
might have been better an income that might have been larger and
a soul that might have been considerably cleaner the Nilghai would
comfort himself with the thought I rode with Bredows brigade at
Vionville and take heart for any lesser battle the next day might
bring

I know he said very gravely I was always glad that you left it
out

I left it out because Nilghai taught me what the Germany army learned
then and what Schmidt taught their cavalry I dont know German
What is it Take care of the time and the dressing will take care of
itself I must ride my own line to my own beat old man

Tempe ist richtung Youve learned your lesson well said the Nilghai

He must go alone He speaks truth Torp

Maybe Im as wrong as I can behideously wrong I must find that out
for myself as I have to think things out for myself but I darent turn
my head to dress by the next man It hurts me a great deal more than you
know not to be able to go but I cannot thats all I must do my own
work and live my own life in my own way because Im responsible for
both Only dont think I frivol about it Torp I have my own matches and
sulphur and Ill make my own hell thanks

There was an uncomfortable pause Then Torpenhow said blandly What did
the Governor of North Carolina say to the Governor of South Carolina

Excellent notion It is a long time between drinks There are the
makings of a very fine prig in you Dick said the Nilghai

Ive liberated my mind estimable Binkie with the feathers in his
mouth Dick picked up the still indignant one and shook him tenderly
Youre tied up in a sack and made to run about blind Binkiewee
without any reason and it has hurt your little feelings Never mind
Sic volo sic jubeo stet pro ratione voluntas and dont sneeze in my
eye because I talk Latin Good night

He went out of the room

Thats distinctly one for you said the Nilghai I told you it was
hopeless to meddle with him Hes not pleased

Hed swear at me if he werent I cant make it out He has the
gofever upon him and he wont go I only hope that he maynt have to go
some day when he doesnt want to said Torpenhow

    

In his own room Dick was settling a question with himselfand the
question was whether all the world and all that was therein and a
burning desire to exploit both was worth one threepenny piece thrown
into the Thames

It came of seeing the sea and Im a cur to think about it he
decided After all the honeymoon will be that tourwith reservations
only only I didnt realise that the sea was so strong I didnt
feel it so much when I was with Maisie These damnable songs did it
Hes beginning again

But it was only Herricks Nightpiece to Julia that the Nilghai sang
and before it was ended Dick reappeared on the threshold not altogether
clothed indeed but in his right mind thirsty and at peace

The mood had come and gone with the rising and the falling of the tide
by Fort Keeling



CHAPTER IX

 If I have taken the common clay
 And wrought it cunningly
 In the shape of a god that was digged a clod
 The greater honour to me

 If thou hast taken the common clay
 And thy hands be not free
 From the taint of the soil
 thou hast made thy spoil
 The greater shame to thee
 The Two Potters

HE DID no work of any kind for the rest of the week Then came another
Sunday He dreaded and longed for the day always but since the
redhaired girl had sketched him there was rather more dread than desire
in his mind

He found that Maisie had entirely neglected his suggestions about
linework She had gone off at score filed with some absurd notion for a
fancy head It cost Dick something to command his temper

Whats the good of suggesting anything he said pointedly

Ah but this will be a picturea real picture and I know that Kami
will let me send it to the Salon You dont mind do you

I suppose not But you wont have time for the Salon

Maisie hesitated a little She even felt uncomfortable

Were going over to France a month sooner because of it I shall get
the idea sketched out here and work it up at Kamis

Dicks heart stood still and he came very near to being disgusted with
his queen who could do no wrong Just when I thought I had made some
headway she goes off chasing butterflies Its too maddening

There was no possibility of arguing for the redhaired girl was in the
studio Dick could only look unutterable reproach

Im sorry he said and I think you make a mistake But whats the
idea of your new picture

I took it from a book

Thats bad to begin with Books arent the places for pictures
And

Its this said the redhaired girl behind him I was reading it to
Maisie the other day from The City of Dreadful Night Dyou know the
book

A little I am sorry I spoke There are pictures in it What has taken
her fancy

The description of the Melancolia

 Her folded wings as of a mighty eagle
 But all too impotent to lift the regal
 Robustness of her earthborn strength and pride

And here again Maisie get the tea dear

 The forehead charged with baleful thoughts and dreams
 The household bunch of keys the housewifes gown
 Voluminous indented and yet rigid
 As though a shell of burnished metal frigid
 Her feet thickshod to tread all weakness down

There was no attempt to conceal the scorn of the lazy voice Dick
winced

But that has been done already by an obscure artist by the name of
Durer said he How does the poem run

 Three centuries and threescore years ago
 With phantasies of his peculiar thought

You might as well try to rewrite Hamlet It will be a waste of time

No it wont said Maisie putting down the teacups with a clatter to
reassure herself And I mean to do it Cant you see what a beautiful
thing it would make

How in perdition can one do work when one hasnt had the proper
training Any fool can get a notion It needs training to drive the
thing throughtraining and conviction not rushing after the first
fancy Dick spoke between his teeth

You dont understand said Maisie I think I can do it

Again the voice of the girl behind him

 Baffled and beaten back she works on still
 Weary and sick of soul she works the more

 Sustained by her indomitable will
 The hands shall fashion and the brain shall pore
 And all her sorrow shall be turned to labour

I fancy Maisie means to embody herself in the picture

Sitting on a throne of rejected pictures No I shant dear The
notion in itself has fascinated meOf course you dont care for fancy
heads Dick I dont think you could do them You like blood and bones

Thats a direct challenge If you can do a Melancolia that isnt merely
a sorrowful female head I can do a better one and I will too What
dyou know about Melacolias Dick firmly believed that he was even then
tasting threequarters of all the sorrow in the world

She was a woman said Maisie and she suffered a great dealtill
she could suffer no more Then she began to laugh at it all and then I
painted her and sent her to the Salon

The redhaired girl rose up and left the room laughing

Dick looked at Maisie humbly and hopelessly

Never mind about the picture he said Are you really going back to
Kamis for a month before your time

I must if I want to get the picture done

And thats all you want

Of course Dont be stupid Dick

You havent the power You have only the ideasthe ideas and the
little cheap impulses How you could have kept at your work for ten
years steadily is a mystery to me So you are really goinga month
before you need

I must do my work

Your workbah No I didnt mean that Its all right dear
Of course you must do your work andI think Ill say goodbye for this
week

Wont you even stay for tea

No thank you Have I your leave to go dear Theres nothing more you
particularly want me to do and the linework doesnt matter

I wish you could stay and then we could talk over my picture If only
one single pictures a success it draws attention to all the others I
know some of my work is good if only people could see And you neednt
have been so rude about it

Im sorry Well talk the Melancolia over some one of the other
Sundays There are four moreyes one two three fourbefore you go
Goodbye Maisie

Maisie stood by the studio window thinking till the redhaired girl
returned a little white at the corners of her lips

Dicks gone off said Maisie Just when I wanted to talk about the
picture Isnt it selfish of him

Her companion opened her lips as if to speak shut them again and went
on reading The City of Dreadful Night

Dick was in the Park walking round and round a tree that he had chosen
as his confidante for many Sundays past He was swearing audibly and
when he found that the infirmities of the English tongue hemmed in his
rage he sought consolation in Arabic which is expressly designed for
the use of the afflicted He was not pleased with the reward of his
patient service nor was he pleased with himself and it was long before
he arrived at the proposition that the queen could do no wrong

Its a losing game he said Im worth nothing when a whim of hers
is in question But in a losing game at Port Said we used to double
the stakes and go on She do a Melancolia She hasnt the power or the
insight or the training Only the desire Shes cursed with the curse
of Reuben She wont do linework because it means real work and yet
shes stronger than I am Ill make her understand that I can beat her
on her own Melancolia Even then she wouldnt care She says I can only
do blood and bones I dont believe she has blood in her veins All the
same I lover her and I must go on loving her and if I can humble her
inordinate vanity I will Ill do a Melancolia that shall be something
like a Melancolia the Melancolia that transcends all wit Ill do it
at once conbless her

He discovered that the notion would not come to order and that he could
not free his mind for an hour from the thought of Maisies departure
He took very small interest in her rough studies for the Melancolia when
she showed them next week The Sundays were racing past and the time
was at hand when all the church bells in London could not ring
Maisie back to him Once or twice he said something to Binkie about
hermaphroditic futilities but the little dog received so many
confidences both from Torpenhow and Dick that he did not trouble his
tulipears to listen

Dick was permitted to see the girls off They were going by the Dover
nightboat and they hoped to return in August It was then February
and Dick felt that he was being hardly used Maisie was so busy
stripping the small house across the Park and packing her canvases
that she had not time for thought Dick went down to Dover and wasted
a day there fretting over a wonderful possibility Would Maisie at the
very last allow him one small kiss He reflected that he might capture
her by the strong arm as he had seem women captured in the Southern
Soudan and lead her away but Maisie would never be led She would turn
her gray eyes upon him and say Dick how selfish you are Then his
courage would fail him It would be better after all to beg for that
kiss

Maisie looked more than usually kissable as she stepped from the
nightmail on to the windy pier in a gray waterproof and a little gray
cloth travellingcap The redhaired girl was not so lovely Her green
eyes were hollow and her lips were dry Dick saw the trunks aboard and
went to Maisies side in the darkness under the bridge The mailbags
were thundering into the forehold and the redhaired girl was watching
them

Youll have a rough passage tonight said Dick Its blowing outside
I suppose I may come over and see you if Im good

You mustnt I shall be busy At least if I want you Ill send for
you But I shall write from VitrysurMarne I shall have heaps of
things to consult you about Oh Dick you have been so good to meso
good to me

Thank you for that dear It hasnt made any difference has it

I cant tell a fib It hasntin that way But dont think Im not
grateful

Damn the gratitude said Dick huskily to the paddlebox

Whats the use of worrying You know I should ruin your life and youd
ruin mine as things are now You remember what you said when you were
so angry that day in the Park One of us has to be broken Cant you
wait till that day comes

No love I want you unbrokenall to myself

Maisie shook her head My poor Dick what can I say

Dont say anything Give me a kiss Only one kiss Maisie Ill swear
I wont take any more You might as well and then I can be sure youre
grateful

Maisie put her cheek forward and Dick took his reward in the darkness

It was only one kiss but since there was no timelimit specified it
was a long one Maisie wrenched herself free angrily and Dick stood
abashed and tingling from head to toe

Goodbye darling I didnt mean to scare you Im sorry Onlykeep
well and do good workspecially the Melancolia Im going to do
one too Remember me to Kami and be careful what you drink Country
drinkingwater is bad everywhere but its worse in France Write to
me if you want anything and goodbye Say goodbye to the
whateveryoucallum girl andcant I have another kiss No Youre
quite right Goodbye

A shout told him that it was not seemly to charge of the mailbag
incline He reached the pier as the steamer began to move off and he
followed her with his heart

And theres nothingnothing in the wide worldto keep us apart except
her obstinacy These Calais nightboats are much too small Ill get
Torp to write to the papers about it Shes beginning to pitch already

Maisie stood where Dick had left her till she heard a little gasping
cough at her elbow The redhaired girls eyes were alight with cold
flame

He kissed you she said How could you let him when he wasnt
anything to you How dared you to take a kiss from him Oh Maisie
lets go to the ladies cabin Im sickdeadly sick

We arent into open water yet Go down dear and Ill stay here
I dont like the smell of the engines Poor Dick He deserved
oneonly one But I didnt think hed frighten me so

Dick returned to town next day just in time for lunch for which he had
telegraphed To his disgust there were only empty plates in the studio

He lifted up his voice like the bears in the fairytale and Torpenhow
entered looking guilty

Hsh said he Dont make such a noise I took it Come into my
rooms and Ill show you why

Dick paused amazed at the threshold for on Torpenhows sofa lay a
girl asleep and breathing heavily The little cheap sailorhat the
blueandwhite dress fitter for June than for February dabbled with
mud at the skirts the jacket trimmed with imitation Astrakhan and
ripped at the shoulderseams the oneandelevenpenny umbrella and
above all the disgraceful condition of the kidtopped boots declared
all things

Oh I say old man this is too bad You mustnt bring this sort up
here They steal things from the rooms

It looks bad I admit but I was coming in after lunch and she
staggered into the hall I thought she was drunk at first but it was
collapse I couldnt leave her as she was so I brought her up here and
gave her your lunch She was fainting from want of food She went fast
asleep the minute she had finished

I know something of that complaint Shes been living on sausages
I suppose Torp you should have handed her over to a policeman for
presuming to faint in a respectable house Poor little wretch Look at
the face There isnt an ounce of immorality in it Only follyslack
fatuous feeble futile folly Its a typical head Dyou notice how
the skull begins to show through the flesh padding on the face and
cheekbone

What a coldblooded barbarian it is Dont hit a woman when shes
down Cant we do anything She was simply dropping with starvation She
almost fell into my arms and when she got to the food she ate like a
wild beast It was horrible

I can give her money which she would probably spend in drinks Is she
going to sleep for ever

The girl opened her eyes and glared at the men between terror and
effrontery

Feeling better said Torpenhow

Yes Thank you There arent many gentlemen that are as kind as you
are Thank you

When did you leave service said Dick who had been watching the
scarred and chapped hands

How did you know I was in service I was General servant I didnt
like it

And how do you like being your own mistress

Do I look as if I liked it

I suppose not One moment Would you be good enough to turn your face
to the window

The girl obeyed and Dick watched her face keenlyso keenly that she
made as if to hide behind Torpenhow

The eyes have it said Dick walking up and down They are superb
eyes for my business And after all every head depends on the eyes
This has been sent from heaven to make up forwhat was taken away
Now the weekly strains off my shoulders I can get to work in earnest
Evidently sent from heaven Yes Raise your chin a little please

Gently old man gently Youre scaring somebody out of her wits said
Torpenhow who could see the girl trembling

Dont let him hit me Oh please dont let him hit me Ive been hit
cruel today because I spoke to a man Dont let him look at me like
that Hes reglar wicked that one Dont let him look at me like that
neither Oh I feel as if I hadnt nothing on when he looks at me like
that

The overstrained nerves in the frail body gave way and the girl wept
like a little child and began to scream Dick threw open the window and
Torpenhow flung the door back

There you are said Dick soothingly My friend here can call for a
policeman and you can run through that door Nobody is going to hurt
you

The girl sobbed convulsively for a few minutes and then tried to laugh

Nothing in the world to hurt you Now listen to me for a minute Im
what they call an artist by profession You know what artists do

They draw the things in red and black ink on the popshop labels

I dare say I havent risen to popshop labels yet Those are done by
the Academicians I want to draw your head

What for

Because its pretty That is why you will come to the room across the
landing three times a week at eleven in the morning and Ill give you
three quid a week just for sitting still and being drawn And theres a
quid on account

For nothing Oh my The girl turned the sovereign in her hand and
with more foolish tears Aint neither o you two gentlemen afraid of
my bilking you

No Only ugly girls do that Try and remember this place And by the
way whats your name

Im BessieBessieIts no use giving the rest Bessie
BrokeStonebroke if you like Whats your names But thereno one
ever gives the real ones

Dick consulted Torpenhow with his eyes

My names Heldar and my friends called Torpenhow and you must be
sure to come here Where do you live

Souththewaterone roomfive and sixpence a week Arent you
making fun of me about that three quid

Youll see later on And Bessie next time you come remember you
neednt wear that paint Its bad for the skin and I have all the
colours youll be likely to need

Bessie withdrew scrubbing her cheek with a ragged pockethandkerchief
The two men looked at each other

Youre a man said Torpenhow

Im afraid Ive been a fool It isnt our business to run about the
earth reforming Bessie Brokes And a woman of any kind has no right on
this landing

Perhaps she wont come back

She will if she thinks she can get food and warmth here I know she
will worse luck But remember old man she isnt a woman shes my
model and be careful

The idea Shes a dissolute little scarecrowa guttersnippet and
nothing more

So you think Wait till she has been fed a little and freed from fear
That fair type recovers itself very quickly You wont know her in a
week or two when that abject fear has died out of her eyes Shell be
too happy and smiling for my purposes

But surely youre not taking her out of charityto please me

I am not in the habit of playing with hot coals to please anybody She
has been sent from heaven as I may have remarked before to help me
with my Melancolia

Never heard a word about the lady before

Whats the use of having a friend if you must sling your notions at
him in words You ought to know what Im thinking about Youve heard me
grunt lately

Even so but grunts mean anything in your language from bad baccy to
wicked dealers And I dont think Ive been much in your confidence for
some time

It was a high and soulful grunt You ought to have understood that
it meant the Melancolia Dick walked Torpenhow up and down the room
keeping silence Then he smote him in the ribs Now dont you see it
Bessies abject futility and the terror in her eyes welded on to one
or two details in the way of sorrow that have come under my experience
lately Likewise some orange and blacktwo keys of each But I cant
explain on an empty stomach

It sounds mad enough Youd better stick to your soldiers Dick
instead of maundering about heads and eyes and experiences

Think so Dick began to dance on his heels singing

Theyre as proud as a turkey when they hold the ready cash You ought
to ear the way they laugh an joke They are tricky an theyre funny
when theyve got the ready moneyOw but see em when theyre all
stonebroke

Then he sat down to pour out his heart to Maisie in a foursheet letter
of counsel and encouragement and registered an oath that he would get
to work with an undivided heart as soon as Bessie should reappear

The girl kept her appointment unpainted and unadorned afraid and
overbold by turns When she found that she was merely expected to sit
still she grew calmer and criticised the appointments of the studio
with freedom and some point She liked the warmth and the comfort and
the release from fear of physical pain Dick made two or three studies
of her head in monochrome but the actual notion of the Melancolia would
not arrive

What a mess you keep your things in said Bessie some days later
when she felt herself thoroughly at home I spose your clothes are
just as bad Gentlemen never think what buttons and tape are made for

I buy things to wear and wear em till they go to pieces I dont know
what Torpenhow does

Bessie made diligent inquiry in the latters room and unearthed a bale
of disreputable socks Some of these Ill mend now she said and
some Ill take home Dyou know I sit all day long at home doing
nothing just like a lady and no more noticing them other girls in
the house than if they was so many flies I dont have any unnecessary
words but I put em down quick I can tell you when they talk to me
No its quite nice these days I lock my door and they can only
call me names through the keyhole and I sit inside just like a lady
mending socks Mr Torpenhow wears his socks out both ends at once

Three quid a week from me and the delights of my society No socks
mended Nothing from Torp except a nod on the landing now and again and
all his socks mended Bessie is very much a woman thought Dick and he
looked at her between halfshut eyes Food and rest had transformed the
girl as Dick knew they would

What are you looking at me like that for she said quickly Dont
You look reglar bad when you look that way You dont think much o me
do you

That depends on how you behave

Bessie behaved beautifully Only it was difficult at the end of a
sitting to bid her go out into the gray streets She very much preferred
the studio and a big chair by the stove with some socks in her lap as
an excuse for delay Then Torpenhow would come in and Bessie would
be moved to tell strange and wonderful stories of her past and still
stranger ones of her present improved circumstances She would make them
tea as though she had a right to make it and once or twice on these
occasions Dick caught Torpenhows eyes fixed on the trim little figure
and because Bessies flittings about the room made Dick ardently long
for Maisie he realised whither Torpenhows thoughts were tending And
Bessie was exceedingly careful of the condition of Torpenhows linen
She spoke very little to him but sometimes they talked together on the
landing

I was a great fool Dick said to himself I know what red firelight
looks like when a mans tramping through a strange town and ours is a
lonely selfish sort of life at the best I wonder Maisie doesnt feel
that sometimes But I cant order Bessie away Thats the worst of
beginning things One never knows where they stop

One evening after a sitting prolonged to the last limit of the light
Dick was roused from a nap by a broken voice in Torpenhows room He
jumped to his feet Now what ought I to do It looks foolish to go
inOh bless you Binkie The little terrier thrust Torpenhows door
open with his nose and came out to take possession of Dicks chair The
door swung wide unheeded and Dick across the landing could see Bessie
in the halflight making her little supplication to Torpenhow She was
kneeling by his side and her hands were clasped across his knee

I knowI know she said thickly Tisnt right o me to do this
but I cant help it and you were so kindso kind and you never took
any notice o me And Ive mended all your things so carefullyI did
Oh please tisnt as if I was asking you to marry me I wouldnt think
of it But youcouldnt you take and live with me till Miss Right comes
along Im only Miss Wrong I know but Id work my hands to the bare
bone for you And Im not ugly to look at Say you will

Dick hardly recognised Torpenhows voice in replyBut look here Its
no use Im liable to be ordered off anywhere at a minutes notice if a
war breaks out At a minutes noticedear

What does that matter Until you go then Until you go Tisnt much
Im asking andyou dont know how good I can cook She had put an arm
round his neck and was drawing his head down

UntilIgo then

Torp said Dick across the landing He could hardly steady his voice

Come here a minute old man Im in trouble

Heaven send hell listen to me There was something very like an oath
from Bessies lips She was afraid of Dick and disappeared down the
staircase in panic but it seemed an age before Torpenhow entered the
studio He went to the mantelpiece buried his head on his arms and
groaned like a wounded bull

What the devil right have you to interfere he said at last

Whos interfering with which Your own sense told you long ago you
couldnt be such a fool It was a tough rack St Anthony but youre
all right now

I oughtnt to have seen her moving about these rooms as if they
belonged to her Thats what upset me It gives a lonely man a sort of
hankering doesnt it said Torpenhow piteously

Now you talk sense It does But since you arent in a condition
to discuss the disadvantages of double housekeeping do you know what
youre going to do

I dont I wish I did

Youre going away for a season on a brilliant tour to regain tone
Youre going to Brighton or Scarborough or Prawle Point to see the
ships go by And youre going at once Isnt it odd Ill take care of
Binkie but out you go immediately Never resist the devil He holds the
bank Fly from him Pack your things and go

I believe youre right Where shall I go

And you call yourself a special correspondent Pack first and inquire
afterwards

An hour later Torpenhow was despatched into the night for a hansom

Youll probably think of some place to go to while youre moving said
Dick On to Euston to begin with andoh yesget drunk tonight

He returned to the studio and lighted more candles for he found the
room very dark

Oh you Jezebel you futile little Jezebel Wont you hate me
tomorrowBinkie come here

Binkie turned over on his back on the hearthrug and Dick stirred him
with a meditative foot

I said she was not immoral I was wrong She said she could cook That
showed premeditated sin Oh Binkie if you are a man you will go to
perdition but if you are a woman and say that you can cook you will
go to a much worse place



CHAPTER X

 Whats you that follows at my side
 The foe that ye must fight my lord
 That hirples swift as I can ride
 The shadow of the night my lord
 Then wheel my horse against the foe
 Hes down and overpast my lord

 Ye war against the sunset glow
 The darkness gathers fast my lord
 The Fight of Heriots Ford

This is a cheerful life said Dick some days later Torps away
Bessie hates me I cant get at the notion of the Melancolia Maisies
letters are scrappy and I believe I have indigestion What give a man
pains across the head and spots before his eyes Binkie Shall us take
some liver pills

Dick had just gone through a lively scene with Bessie She had for the
fiftieth time reproached him for sending Torpenhow away She explained
her enduring hatred for Dick and made it clear to him that she only sat
for the sake of his money And Mr Torpenhows ten times a better man
than you she concluded

He is Thats why he went away I should have stayed and made love to
you

The girl sat with her chin on her hand scowling To me Id like to
catch you If I wasnt afraid o being hung Id kill you Thats what
Id do Dyou believe me

Dick smiled wearily It is not pleasant to live in the company of a
notion that will not work out a foxterrier that cannot talk and a
woman who talks too much He would have answered but at that moment
there unrolled itself from one corner of the studio a veil as it were
of the flimsiest gauze He rubbed his eyes but the gray haze would not
go

This is disgraceful indigestion Binkie we will go to a medicineman
We cant have our eyes interfered with for by these we get our bread
also muttonchop bones for little dogs

The doctor was an affable local practitioner with white hair and he
said nothing till Dick began to describe the gray film in the studio

We all want a little patching and repairing from time to time he
chirped Like a ship my dear sirexactly like a ship Sometimes the
hull is out of order and we consult the surgeon sometimes the
rigging and then I advise sometimes the engines and we go to the
brainspecialist sometimes the lookout on the bridge is tired and
then we see an oculist I should recommend you to see an oculist A
little patching and repairing from time to time is all we want An
oculist by all means

Dick sought an oculistthe best in London He was certain that the
local practitioner did not know anything about his trade and more
certain that Maisie would laugh at him if he were forced to wear
spectacles

Ive neglected the warnings of my lord the stomach too long Hence
these spots before the eyes Binkie I can see as well as I ever could

As he entered the dark hall that led to the consultingroom a man
cannoned against him Dick saw the face as it hurried out into the
street

Thats the writertype He has the same modelling of the forehead as
Torp He looks very sick Probably heard something he didnt like

Even as he thought a great fear came upon Dick a fear that made him
hold his breath as he walked into the oculists waiting room with the
heavy carved furniture the darkgreen paper and the soberhued prints
on the wall He recognised a reproduction of one of his own sketches

Many people were waiting their turn before him His eye was caught by a
flaming redandgold Christmascarol book Little children came to that
eyedoctor and they needed largetype amusement

Thats idolatrous bad Art he said drawing the book towards himself

From the anatomy of the angels it has been made in Germany He opened
in mechanically and there leaped to his eyes a verse printed in red
ink

 The next good joy that Mary had
 It was the joy of three
 To see her good Son Jesus Christ
 Making the blind to see
 Making the blind to see good Lord
 And happy we may be
 Praise Father Son and Holy Ghost
 To all eternity

Dick read and reread the verse till his turn came and the doctor
was bending above him seated in an armchair The blaze of the
gasmicroscope in his eyes made him wince The doctors hand touched the
scar of the swordcut on Dicks head and Dick explained briefly how he
had come by it When the flame was removed Dick saw the doctors face
and the fear came upon him again The doctor wrapped himself in a
mist of words Dick caught allusions to scar frontal bone optic
nerve extreme caution and the avoidance of mental anxiety

Verdict he said faintly My business is painting and I darent
waste time What do you make of it

Again the whirl of words but this time they conveyed a meaning

Can you give me anything to drink

Many sentences were pronounced in that darkened room and the prisoners
often needed cheering Dick found a glass of liqueur brandy in his hand

As far as I can gather he said coughing above the spirit you call
it decay of the optic nerve or something and therefore hopeless What
is my timelimit avoiding all strain and worry

Perhaps one year

My God And if I dont take care of myself

I really could not say One cannot ascertain the exact amount of injury
inflicted by the swordcut The scar is an old one andexposure to the
strong light of the desert did you saywith excessive application to
fine work I really could not say

I beg your pardon but it has come without any warning If you will
let me Ill sit here for a minute and then Ill go You have been very
good in telling me the truth Without any warning without any warning
Thanks

Dick went into the street and was rapturously received by Binkie

Weve got it very badly little dog Just as badly as we can get it
Well go to the Park to think it out

They headed for a certain tree that Dick knew well and they sat down to
think because his legs were trembling under him and there was cold fear
at the pit of his stomach

How could it have come without any warning Its as sudden as being
shot Its the living death Binkie Were to be shut up in the dark in
one year if were careful and we shant see anybody and we shall
never have anything we want not though we live to be a hundred Binkie
wagged his tail joyously Binkie we must think Lets see how it
feels to be blind Dick shut his eyes and flaming commas and
Catherinewheels floated inside the lids Yet when he looked across the
Park the scope of his vision was not contracted He could see perfectly
until a procession of slowwheeling fireworks defiled across his
eyeballs

Little dorglums we arent at all well Lets go home If only Torp
were back now

But Torpenhow was in the south of England inspecting dockyards in the
company of the Nilghai His letters were brief and full of mystery

Dick had never asked anybody to help him in his joys or his sorrows He
argued in the loneliness of his studio henceforward to be decorated
with a film of gray gauze in one corner that if his fate were
blindness all the Torpenhows in the world could not save him I cant
call him off his trip to sit down and sympathise with me I must pull
through this business alone he said He was lying on the sofa eating
his moustache and wondering what the darkness of the night would be
like Then came to his mind the memory of a quaint scene in the Soudan
A soldier had been nearly hacked in two by a broadbladed Arab spear
For one instant the man felt no pain Looking down he saw that his
lifeblood was going from him The stupid bewilderment on his face
was so intensely comic that both Dick and Torpenhow still panting and
unstrung from a fight for life had roared with laughter in which the
man seemed as if he would join but as his lips parted in a sheepish
grin the agony of death came upon him and he pitched grunting at their
feet Dick laughed again remembering the horror It seemed so exactly
like his own case

But I have a little more time allowed me he said He paced up and
down the room quietly at first but afterwards with the hurried feet of
fear It was as though a black shadow stood at his elbow and urged him
to go forward and there were only weaving circles and floating pindots
before his eyes

We need to be calm Binkie we must be calm He talked aloud for the
sake of distraction This isnt nice at all What shall we do We must
do something Our time is short I shouldnt have believed that this
morning but now things are different Binkie where was Moses when the
light went out

Binkie smiled from ear to ear as a wellbred terrier should but made
no suggestion

Were there but world enough and time This coyness Binkie were not
crime But at my back I always hear He wiped his forehead
which was unpleasantly damp What can I do What can I do I havent
any notions left and I cant think connectedly but I must do
something or I shall go off my head

The hurried walk recommenced Dick stopping every now and again to drag
forth longneglected canvases and old notebooks for he turned to his
work by instinct as a thing that could not fail You wont do and you
wont do he said at each inspection No more soldiers I couldnt
paint em Sudden death comes home too nearly and this is battle and
murder for me

The day was failing and Dick thought for a moment that the twilight
of the blind had come upon him unaware Allah Almighty he cried
despairingly help me through the time of waiting and I wont whine
when my punishment comes What can I do now before the light goes

There was no answer Dick waited till he could regain some sort of
control over himself His hands were shaking and he prided himself on
their steadiness he could feel that his lips were quivering and the
sweat was running down his face He was lashed by fear driven forward
by the desire to get to work at once and accomplish something and
maddened by the refusal of his brain to do more than repeat the news
that he was about to go blind Its a humiliating exhibition he
thought and Im glad Torp isnt here to see The doctor said I was to
avoid mental worry Come here and let me pet you Binkie

The little dog yelped because Dick nearly squeezed the bark out of him

Then he heard the man speaking in the twilight and doglike understood
that his trouble stood off from himAllah is good Binkie Not quite
so gentle as we could wish but well discuss that later I think I see
my way to it now All those studies of Bessies head were nonsense and
they nearly brought your master into a scrape I hold the notion now as
clear as crystal the Melancolia that transcends all wit There shall
be Maisie in that head because I shall never get Maisie and Bess of
course because she knows all about Melancolia though she doesnt know
she knows and there shall be some drawing in it and it shall all end
up with a laugh Thats for myself Shall she giggle or grin No she
shall laugh right out of the canvas and every man and woman that ever
had a sorrow of their own shallwhat is it the poem says Understand
the speech and feel a stir Of fellowship in all disastrous fight

In all disastrous fight Thats better than painting the thing merely
to pique Maisie I can do it now because I have it inside me Binkie
Im going to hold you up by your tail Youre an omen Come here

Binkie swung head downward for a moment without speaking

Rather like holding a guineapig but youre a brave little dog and
you dont yelp when youre hung up It is an omen

Binkie went to his own chair and as often as he looked saw Dick walking
up and down rubbing his hands and chuckling That night Dick wrote a
letter to Maisie full of the tenderest regard for her health but saying
very little about his own and dreamed of the Melancolia to be born Not
till morning did he remember that something might happen to him in the
future

He fell to work whistling softly and was swallowed up in the clean
clear joy of creation which does not come to man too often lest he
should consider himself the equal of his God and so refuse to die at
the appointed time He forgot Maisie Torpenhow and Binkie at his feet
but remembered to stir Bessie who needed very little stirring into a
tremendous rage that he might watch the smouldering lights in her eyes

He threw himself without reservation into his work and did not think of
the doom that was to overtake him for he was possessed with his notion
and the things of this world had no power upon him

Youre pleased today said Bessie

Dick waved his mahlstick in mystic circles and went to the sideboard
for a drink In the evening when the exaltation of the day had died
down he went to the sideboard again and after some visits became
convinced that the eyedoctor was a liar since he could still see
everything very clearly

He was of opinion that he would even make a home for Maisie and that
whether she liked it or not she should be his wife The mood passed next
morning but the sideboard and all upon it remained for his comfort

Again he set to work and his eyes troubled him with spots and dashes
and blurs till he had taken counsel with the sideboard and the
Melancolia both on the canvas and in his own mind appeared lovelier than
ever There was a delightful sense of irresponsibility upon him such
as they feel who walking among their fellowmen know that the
deathsentence of disease is upon them and seeing that fear is but
waste of the little time left are riotously happy The days passed
without event

Bessie arrived punctually always and though her voice seemed to Dick
to come from a distance her face was always very near The Melancolia
began to flame on the canvas in the likeness of a woman who had known
all the sorrow in the world and was laughing at it It was true that the
corners of the studio draped themselves in gray film and retired into
the darkness that the spots in his eyes and the pains across his head
were very troublesome and that Maisies letters were hard to read and
harder still to answer He could not tell her of his trouble and he
could not laugh at her accounts of her own Melancolia which was always
going to be finished But the furious days of toil and the nights of
wild dreams made amends for all and the sideboard was his best friend
on earth

Bessie was singularly dull She used to shriek with rage when Dick
stared at her between halfclosed eyes Now she sulked or watched him
with disgust saying very little

Torpenhow had been absent for six weeks An incoherent note heralded his
return News great news he wrote The Nilghai knows and so
does the Keneu Were all back on Thursday Get lunch and clean your
accoutrements

Dick showed Bessie the letter and she abused him for that he had ever
sent Torpenhow away and ruined her life

Well said Dick brutally youre better as you are instead of
making love to some drunken beast in the street He felt that he had
rescued Torpenhow from great temptation

I dont know if thats any worse than sitting to a drunken beast in a
studio You havent been sober for three weeks Youve been soaking the
whole time and yet you pretend youre better than me

What dyou mean said Dick

Mean Youll see when Mr Torpenhow comes back

It was not long to wait Torpenhow met Bessie on the staircase without a
sign of feeling He had news that was more to him than many Bessies and
the Keneu and the Nilghai were trampling behind him calling for Dick

Drinking like a fish Bessie whispered Hes been at it for nearly a
month She followed the men stealthily to hear judgment done

They came into the studio rejoicing to be welcomed over effusively by
a drawn lined shrunken haggard wreckunshaven bluewhite about
the nostrils stooping in the shoulders and peering under his eyebrows
nervously The drink had been at work as steadily as Dick

Is this you said Torpenhow

All thats left of me Sit down Binkies quite well and Ive been
doing some good work He reeled where he stood

Youve done some of the worst work youve ever done in your life Man
alive youre

Torpenhow turned to his companions appealingly and they left the room
to find lunch elsewhere Then he spoke but since the reproof of a
friend is much too sacred and intimate a thing to be printed and since
Torpenhow used figures and metaphors which were unseemly and contempt
untranslatable it will never be known what was actually said to Dick
who blinked and winked and picked at his hands After a time the culprit
began to feel the need of a little selfrespect He was quite sure that
he had not in any way departed from virtue and there were reasons too
of which Torpenhow knew nothing He would explain

He rose tried to straighten his shoulders and spoke to the face he
could hardly see

You are right he said But I am right too After you went away I
had some trouble with my eyes So I went to an oculist and he turned a
gasogeneI mean a gasengineinto my eye That was very long ago He
said Scar on the headswordcut and optic nerve Make a note of
that So I am going blind I have some work to do before I go blind and
I suppose that I must do it I cannot see much now but I can see best
when I am drunk I did not know I was drunk till I was told but I must
go on with my work If you want to see it there it is He pointed to
the all but finished Melancolia and looked for applause

Torpenhow said nothing and Dick began to whimper feebly for joy at
seeing Torpenhow again for grief at misdeedsif indeed they were
misdeedsthat made Torpenhow remote and unsympathetic and for childish
vanity hurt since Torpenhow had not given a word of praise to his
wonderful picture

Bessie looked through the keyhole after a long pause and saw the two
walking up and down as usual Torpenhows hand on Dicks shoulder

Hereat she said something so improper that it shocked even Binkie
who was dribbling patiently on the landing with the hope of seeing his
master again



CHAPTER XI

 The lark will make her hymn to God
 The partridge call her brood
 While I forget the heath I trod
 The fields wherein I stood

 Tis dule to know not night from morn
 But deeper dule to know
 I can but hear the hunters horn
 That once I used to blow
 The Only Son

IT WAS the third day after Torpenhows return and his heart was heavy

Do you mean to tell me that you cant see to work without whiskey Its
generally the other way about

Can a drunkard swear on his honour said Dick

Yes if he has been as good a man as you

Then I give you my word of honour said Dick speaking hurriedly
through parched lips Old man I can hardly see your face now Youve
kept me sober for two daysif I ever was drunkand Ive done no
work Dont keep me back any more I dont know when my eyes may give
out The spots and dots and the pains and things are crowding worse than
ever I swear I can see all right when Imwhen Im moderately screwed
as you say Give me three more sittings from Bessie and allthe stuff
I want and the picture will be done I cant kill myself in three days
It only means a touch of D T at the worst

If I give you three days more will you promise me to stop work andthe
other thing whether the pictures finished or not

I cant You dont know what that picture means to me But surely you
could get the Nilghai to help you and knock me down and tie me up I
shouldnt fight for the whiskey but I should for the work

Go on then I give you three days but youre nearly breaking my
heart

Dick returned to his work toiling as one possessed and the yellow
devil of whiskey stood by him and chased away the spots in his eyes The
Melancolia was nearly finished and was all or nearly all that he had
hoped she would be Dick jested with Bessie who reminded him that he
was a drunken beast but the reproof did not move him

You cant understand Bess We are in sight of land now and soon we
shall lie back and think about what weve done Ill give you three
months pay when the pictures finished and next time I have any more
work in handbut that doesnt matter Wont three months pay make you
hate me less

No it wont I hate you and Ill go on hating you Mr Torpenhow
wont speak to me any more Hes always looking at maps

Bessie did not say that she had again laid siege to Torpenhow or that
at the end of our passionate pleading he had picked her up given her a
kiss and put her outside the door with the recommendation not to be a
little fool He spent most of his time in the company of the Nilghai
and their talk was of war in the near future the hiring of transports
and secret preparations among the dockyards He did not wish to see Dick
till the picture was finished

Hes doing firstclass work he said to the Nilghai and its quite
out of his regular line But for the matter of that sos his infernal
soaking

Never mind Leave him alone When he has come to his senses again well
carry him off from this place and let him breathe clean air Poor Dick
I dont envy you Torp when his eyes fail

Yes it will be a case of God help the man whos chained to our
Davie The worst is that we dont know when it will happen and I
believe the uncertainty and the waiting have sent Dick to the whiskey
more than anything else

How the Arab who cut his head open would grin if he knew

Hes at perfect liberty to grin if he can Hes dead Thats poor
consolation now

In the afternoon of the third day Torpenhow heard Dick calling for him

All finished he shouted Ive done it Come in Isnt she a beauty
Isnt she a darling Ive been down to hell to get her but isnt she
worth it

Torpenhow looked at the head of a woman who laugheda fulllipped
holloweyed woman who laughed from out of the canvas as Dick had
intended she would

Who taught you how to do it said Torpenhow The touch and notion
have nothing to do with your regular work What a face it is What eyes
and what insolence Unconsciously he threw back his head and laughed
with her Shes seen the game played outI dont think she had a good
time of itand now she doesnt care Isnt that the idea

Exactly

Where did you get the mouth and chin from They dont belong to Bess

Theyresome one elses But isnt it good Isnt it thundering good
Wasnt it worth the whiskey I did it Alone I did it and its the best
I can do He drew his breath sharply and whispered Just God what
could I not do ten years hence if I can do this nowBy the way what
do you think of it Bess

The girl was biting her lips She loathed Torpenhow because he had taken
no notice of her

I think its just the horridest beastliest thing I ever saw she
answered and turned away

More than you will be of that way of thinking young womanDick
theres a sort of murderous viperine suggestion in the poise of the
head that I dont understand said Torpenhow

Thats trickwork said Dick chuckling with delight at being
completely understood I couldnt resist one little bit of sheer
swagger Its a French trick and you wouldnt understand but its got
at by slewing round the head a trifle and a tiny tiny foreshortening
of one side of the face from the angle of the chin to the top of the
left ear That and deepening the shadow under the lobe of the ear It
was flagrant trickwork but having the notion fixed I felt entitled
to play with itOh you beauty

Amen She is a beauty I can feel it

So will every man who has any sorrow of his own said Dick slapping
his thigh He shall see his trouble there and by the Lord Harry just
when hes feeling properly sorry for himself he shall throw back his
head and laughas she is laughing Ive put the life of my heart and
the light of my eyes into her and I dont care what comes Im
tiredawfully tired I think Ill get to sleep Take away the whiskey
it has served its turn and give Bessie thirtysix quid and three over
for luck Cover the picture

He dropped asleep in the long chair hid face white and haggard almost
before he had finished the sentence Bessie tried to take Torpenhows
hand Arent you never going to speak to me any more she said but
Torpenhow was looking at Dick

What a stock of vanity the man has Ill take him in hand tomorrow and
make much of him He deserves itEh what was that Bess

Nothing Ill put things tidy here a little and then Ill go You
couldnt give Me that three months pay now could you He said you
were to

Torpenhow gave her a check and went to his own rooms Bessie faithfully
tidied up the studio set the door ajar for flight emptied half a
bottle of turpentine on a duster and began to scrub the face of the
Melancolia viciously The paint did not smudge quickly enough She took
a paletteknife and scraped following each stroke with the wet duster
In five minutes the picture was a formless scarred muddle of colours
She threw the paintstained duster into the studio stove stuck out her
tongue at the sleeper and whispered Bilked as she turned to run
down the staircase She would never see Torpenhow any more but she had
at least done harm to the man who had come between her and her desire
and who used to make fun of her Cashing the check was the very cream of
the jest to Bessie Then the little privateer sailed across the Thames
to be swallowed up in the gray wilderness of SouththeWater

Dick slept till late in the evening when Torpenhow dragged him off
to bed His eyes were as bright as his voice was hoarse Lets have
another look at the picture he said insistently as a child

Yougotobed said Torpenhow You arent at all well though you
maynt know it Youre as jumpy as a cat

I reform tomorrow Good night

As he repassed through the studio Torpenhow lifted the cloth above the
picture and almost betrayed himself by outcries Wiped outscraped
out and turped out Hes on the verge of jumps as it is Thats
Bessthe little fiend Only a woman could have done thatwith the
ink not dry on the check too Dick will be raving mad tomorrow It was
all my fault for trying to help gutterdevils Oh my poor Dick the
Lord is hitting you very hard

Dick could not sleep that night partly for pure joy and partly because
the wellknown Catherinewheels inside his eyes had given place to
crackling volcanoes of manycoloured fire Spout away he said aloud

Ive done my work and now you can do what you please He lay still
staring at the ceiling the longpentup delirium of drink in his
veins his brain on fire with racing thoughts that would not stay to be
considered and his hands crisped and dry He had just discovered that
he was painting the face of the Melancolia on a revolving dome ribbed
with millions of lights and that all his wondrous thoughts stood
embodied hundreds of feet below his tiny swinging plank shouting
together in his honour when something cracked inside his temples like
an overstrained bowstring the glittering dome broke inward and he was
alone in the thick night

Ill go to sleep The rooms very dark Lets light a lamp and see how
the Melancolia looks There ought to have been a moon

It was then that Torpenhow heard his name called by a voice that he did
not knowin the rattling accents of deadly fear

Hes looked at the picture was his first thought as he hurried
into the bedroom and found Dick sitting up and beating the air with his
hands

Torp Torp where are you For pitys sake come to me

Whats the matter

Dick clutched at his shoulder Matter Ive been lying here for hours
in the dark and you never heard me Torp old man dont go away Im
all in the dark In the dark I tell you

Torpenhow held the candle within a foot of Dicks eyes but there was no
light in those eyes He lit the gas and Dick heard the flame catch The
grip of his fingers on Torpenhows shoulder made Torpenhow wince

Dont leave me You wouldnt leave me alone now would you I cant
see Dyou understand Its blackquite blackand I feel as if I was
falling through it all

Steady does it Torpenhow put his arm round Dick and began to rock him
gently to and fro

Thats good Now dont talk If I keep very quiet for a while this
darkness will lift It seems just on the point of breaking Hsh Dick
knit his brows and stared desperately in front of him The night air was
chilling Torpenhows toes

Can you stay like that a minute he said Ill get my dressinggown
and some slippers

Dick clutched the bedhead with both hands and waited for the darkness
to clear away What a time youve been he cried when Torpenhow
returned Its as black as ever What are you banging about in the
doorway

Long chairhorseblanketpillow Going to sleep by you Lie down
now youll be better in the morning

I shant The voice rose to a wail My God Im blind Im blind and
the darkness will never go away He made as if to leap from the bed
but Torpenhows arms were round him and Torpenhows chin was on his
shoulder and his breath was squeezed out of him He could only gasp
Blind and wriggle feebly

Steady Dickie steady said the deep voice in his ear and the grip
tightened Bite on the bullet old man and dont let them think youre
afraid The grip could draw no closer Both men were breathing heavily

Dick threw his head from side to side and groaned

Let me go he panted Youre cracking my ribs Wewe mustnt let
them think were afraid must weall the powers of darkness and that
lot

Lie down Its all over now

Yes said Dick obediently But would you mind letting me hold your
hand I feel as if I wanted something to hold on to One drops through
the dark so

Torpenhow thrust out a large and hairy paw from the long chair Dick
clutched it tightly and in half an hour had fallen asleep Torpenhow
withdrew his hand and stooping over Dick kissed him lightly on the
forehead as men do sometimes kiss a wounded comrade in the hour of
death to ease his departure

In the gray dawn Torpenhow heard Dick talking to himself He was adrift
on the shoreless tides of delirium speaking very quicklyIts a
pitya great pity but its helped and it must be eaten Master
George Sufficient unto the day is the blindness thereof and further
putting aside all Melancolias and false humours it is of obvious
notorietysuch as mine wasthat the queen can do no wrong Torp
doesnt know that Ill tell him when were a little farther into the
desert

What a bungle those boatmen are making of the steamerropes Theyll
have that fourinch hawser chafed through in a minute I told you
sothere she goes White foam on green water and the steamer slewing
round How good that looks Ill sketch it No I cant Im afflicted
with ophthalmia That was one of the ten plagues of Egypt and it
extends up the Nile in the shape of cataract Ha thats a joke Torp
Laugh you graven image and stand clear of the hawser Itll
knock you into the water and make your dress all dirty Maisie dear

Oh said Torpenhow This happened before That night on the river

Shell be sure to say its my fault if you get muddy and youre quite
near enough to the breakwater Maisie thats not fair Ah I knew youd
miss Low and to the left dear But youve no conviction Dont be angry
darling Id cut my hand off if it would give you anything more than
obstinacy My right hand if it would serve

Now we mustnt listen Heres an island shouting across seas of
misunderstanding with a vengeance But its shouting truth I fancy
said Torpenhow

The babble continued It all bore upon Maisie Sometimes Dick lectured
at length on his craft then he cursed himself for his folly in being
enslaved He pleaded to Maisie for a kissonly one kissbefore she
went away and called to her to come back from VitrysurMarne if she
would but through all his ravings he bade heaven and earth witness that
the queen could do no wrong

Torpenhow listened attentively and learned every detail of Dicks life
that had been hidden from him For three days Dick raved through the
past and then a natural sleep What a strain he has been running
under poor chap said Torpenhow Dick of all men handing himself
over like a dog And I was lecturing him on arrogance I ought to have
known that it was no use to judge a man But I did it What a demon that
girl must be Dicks given her his lifeconfound himand shes given
him one kiss apparently

Torp said Dick from the bed go out for a walk Youve been here
too long Ill get up Hi This is annoying I cant dress myself Oh
its too absurd

Torpenhow helped him into his clothes and led him to the big chair
in the studio He sat quietly waiting under strained nerves for
the darkness to lift It did not lift that day nor the next Dick
adventured on a voyage round the walls He hit his shins against the
stove and this suggested to him that it would be better to crawl on all
fours one hand in front of him Torpenhow found him on the floor

Im trying to get the geography of my new possessions said he Dyou
remember that nigger you gouged in the square Pity you didnt keep the
odd eye It would have been useful Any letters for me Give me all the
ones in fat gray envelopes with a sort of crown thing outside Theyre
of no importance

Torpenhow gave him a letter with a black M on the envelope flap Dick
put it into his pocket There was nothing in it that Torpenhow might
not have read but it belonged to himself and to Maisie who would never
belong to him

When she finds that I dont write shell stop writing Its better
so I couldnt be any use to her now Dick argued and the tempter
suggested that he should make known his condition Every nerve in him
revolted I have fallen low enough already Im not going to beg for
pity Besides it would be cruel to her He strove to put Maisie out of
his thoughts but the blind have many opportunities for thinking and as
the tides of his strength came back to him in the long employless days
of dead darkness Dicks soul was troubled to the core Another letter
and another came from Maisie Then there was silence and Dick sat by
the window the pulse of summer in the air and pictured her being won
by another man stronger than himself His imagination the keener for
the dark background it worked against spared him no single detail that
might send him raging up and down the studio to stumble over the stove
that seemed to be in four places at once Worst of all tobacco would
not taste in the darkness The arrogance of the man had disappeared and
in its place were settled despair that Torpenhow knew and blind passion
that Dick confided to his pillow at night The intervals between
the paroxysms were filled with intolerable waiting and the weight of
intolerable darkness

Come out into the Park said Torpenhow You havent stirred out since
the beginning of things

Whats the use Theres no movement in the dark and besideshe
paused irresolutely at the head of the stairssomething will run over
me

Not if Im with you Proceed gingerly

The roar of the streets filled Dick with nervous terror and he clung to
Torpenhows arm Fancy having to feel for a gutter with your foot he
said petulantly as he turned into the Park Lets curse God and die

Sentries are forbidden to pay unauthorised compliments By Jove there
are the Guards

Dicks figure straightened Lets get near em Lets go in and look
Lets get on the grass and run I can smell the trees

Mind the low railing Thats all right Torpenhow kicked out a tuft
of grass with his heel Smell that he said Isnt it good Dick
sniffed luxuriously Now pick up your feet and run They approached
as near to the regiment as was possible The clank of bayonets being
unfixed made Dicks nostrils quiver

Lets get nearer Theyre in column arent they

Yes How did you know

Felt it Oh my menmy beautiful men He edged forward as though he
could see I could draw those chaps once Wholl draw em now

Theyll move off in a minute Dont jump when the band begins

Huh Im not a new charger Its the silences that hurt Nearer
Torpnearer Oh my God what wouldnt I give to see em for a
minuteone halfminute

He could hear the armed life almost within reach of him could hear the
slings tighten across the bandsmans chest as he heaved the big drum
from the ground

Sticks crossed above his head whispered Torpenhow

I know I know Who should know if I dont Hsh

The drumsticks fell with a boom and the men swung forward to the crash
of the band Dick felt the wind of the massed movement in his face
heard the maddening tramp of feet and the friction of the pouches on the
belts The big drum pounded out the tune It was a musichall refrain
that made a perfect quickstep

 He must be a man of decent height
 He must be a man of weight
 He must come home on a Saturday night
 In a thoroughly sober state
 He must know how to love me
 And he must know how to kiss
 And if hes enough to keep us both
 I cant refuse him bliss

Whats the matter said Torpenhow as he saw Dicks head fall when the
last of the regiment had departed

Nothing I feel a little bit out of the runningthats all Torp
take me back Why did you bring me out



CHAPTER XII

 There were three friends that buried the fourth
 The mould in his mouth and the dust in his eyes
 And they went south and east and north
 The strong man fights but the sick man dies

 There were three friends that spoke of the dead
 The strong man fights but the sick man dies
 And would he were with us now they said
 The sun in our face and the wind in our eyes
 Ballad

The Nilghai was angry with Torpenhow Dick had been sent to bedblind
men are ever under the orders of those who can seeand since he had
returned from the Park had fluently sworn at Torpenhow because he was
alive and all the world because it was alive and could see while he
Dick was dead in the death of the blind who at the best are only
burdens upon their associates Torpenhow had said something about a Mrs
Gummidge and Dick had retired in a black fury to handle and rehandle
three unopened letters from Maisie

The Nilghai fat burly and aggressive was in Torpenhows rooms

Behind him sat the Keneu the Great War Eagle and between them lay a
large map embellished with blackandwhiteheaded pins

I was wrong about the Balkans said the Nilghai But Im not wrong
about this business The whole of our work in the Southern Soudan
must be done over again The public doesnt care of course but the
government does and they are making their arrangements quietly You
know that as well as I do

I remember how the people cursed us when our troops withdrew from
Omdurman It was bound to crop up sooner or later But I cant go said
Torpenhow He pointed through the open door it was a hot night Can
you blame me

The Keneu purred above his pipe like a large and very happy catDont
blame you in the least Its uncommonly good of you and all the rest
of it but every maneven you Torpmust consider his work I know it
sounds brutal but Dicks out of the racedowngastados expended
finished done for He has a little money of his own He wont starve
and you cant pull out of your slide for his sake Think of your own
reputation

Dicks was five times bigger than mine and yours put together

That was because he signed his name to everything he did Its all
ended now You must hold yourself in readiness to move out You can
command your own prices and you do better work than any three of us

Dont tell me how tempting it is Ill stay here to look after Dick
for a while Hes as cheerful as a bear with a sore head but I think he
likes to have me near him

The Nilghai said something uncomplimentary about softheaded fools who
throw away their careers for other fools Torpenhow flushed angrily The
constant strain of attendance on Dick had worn his nerves thin

There remains a third fate said the Keneu thoughtfully Consider
this and be not larger fools than necessary Dick isor rather
wasan ablebodied man of moderate attractions and a certain amount of
audacity

Oho said the Nilghai who remembered an affair at Cairo I begin to
seeTorp Im sorry

Torpenhow nodded forgiveness You were more sorry when he cut you out
thoughGo on Keneu

Ive often thought when Ive seen men die out in the desert that if
the news could be sent through the world and the means of transport
were quick enough there would be one woman at least at each mans
bedside

There would be some mighty quaint revelations Let us be grateful
things are as they are said the Nilghai

Let us rather reverently consider whether Torps threecornered
ministrations are exactly what Dick needs just nowWhat do you think
yourself Torp

I know they arent But what can I do

Lay the matter before the board We are all Dicks friends here Youve
been most in his life

But I picked it up when he was off his head

The greater chance of its being true I thought we should arrive Who
is she

Then Torpenhow told a tale in plain words as a special correspondent
who knows how to make a verbal precis should tell it The men listened
without interruption

Is it possible that a man can come back across the years to his
calflove

said the Keneu Is it possible

I give the facts He says nothing about it now but he sits fumbling
three letters from her when he thinks Im not looking What am I to do

Speak to him said the Nilghai

Oh yes Write to herI dont know her full name rememberand ask
her to accept him out of pity I believe you once told Dick you were
sorry for him Nilghai You remember what happened eh Go into the
bedroom and suggest full confession and an appeal to this Maisie
girl whoever she is I honestly believe hed try to kill you and the
blindness has made him rather muscular

Torpenhows course is perfectly clear said the Keneu He will go to
VitrysurMarne which is on the BezieresLandes Railwaysingle track
from Tourgas The Prussians shelled it out in 70 because there was
a poplar on the top of a hill eighteen hundred yards from the church
spire Theres a squadron of cavalry quartered thereor ought to be
Where this studio Torp spoke about may be I cannot tell That is Torps
business I have given him his route He will dispassionately explain
the situation to the girl and she will come back to Dickthe more
especially because to use Dicks words there is nothing but her
damned obstinacy to keep them apart

And they have four hundred and twenty pounds a year between em

Dick never lost his head for figures even in his delirium You havent
the shadow of an excuse for not going said the Nilghai

Torpenhow looked very uncomfortable But its absurd and impossible I
cant drag her back by the hair

Our businessthe business for which we draw our moneyis to do absurd
and impossible thingsgenerally with no reason whatever except to
amuse the public Here we have a reason The rest doesnt matter I
shall share these rooms with the Nilghai till Torpenhow returns There
will be a batch of unbridled specials coming to town in a little
while and these will serve as their headquarters Another reason for
sending Torpenhow away Thus Providence helps those who help others
andhere the Keneu dropped his measured speechwe cant have you
tied by the leg to Dick when the trouble begins Its your only chance
of getting away and Dick will be grateful

He willworse luck I can but go and try I cant conceive a woman in
her senses refusing Dick

Talk that out with the girl I have seen you wheedle an angry Mahdieh
woman into giving you dates This wont be a tithe as difficult You had
better not be here tomorrow afternoon because the Nilghai and I will be
in possession It is an order Obey

Dick said Torpenhow next morning can I do anything for you

No Leave me alone How often must I remind you that Im blind

Nothing I could go for to fetch for to carry for to bring

No Take those infernal creaking boots of yours away

Poor chap said Torpenhow to himself I must have been sitting on his
nerves lately He wants a lighter step Then aloud Very well Since
youre so independent Im going off for four or five days Say goodbye
at least The housekeeper will look after you and Keneu has my rooms

Dicks face fell You wont be longer than a week at the outside I
know Im touched in the temper but I cant get on without you

Cant you Youll have to do without me in a little time and youll be
glad Im gone

Dick felt his way back to the big chair and wondered what these things
might mean He did not wish to be tended by the housekeeper and yet
Torpenhows constant tenderness jarred on him He did not exactly know
what he wanted The darkness would not lift and Maisies unopened
letters felt worn and old from much handling He could never read them
for himself as long as life endured but Maisie might have sent him some
fresh ones to play with The Nilghai entered with a gifta piece of
red modellingwax He fancied that Dick might find interest in using his
hands Dick poked and patted the stuff for a few minutes and Is it
like anything in the world he said drearily Take it away I may get
the touch of the blind in fifty years Do you know where Torpenhow has
gone

The Nilghai knew nothing Were staying in his rooms till he comes
back Can we do anything for you

Id like to be left alone please Dont think Im ungrateful but Im
best alone

The Nilghai chuckled and Dick resumed his drowsy brooding and sullen
rebellion against fate He had long since ceased to think about the work
he had done in the old days and the desire to do more work had departed
from him He was exceedingly sorry for himself and the completeness
of his tender grief soothed him But his soul and his body cried for
MaisieMaisie who would understand His mind pointed out that Maisie
having her own work to do would not care His experience had taught him
that when money was exhausted women went away and that when a man was
knocked out of the race the others trampled on him Then at the least
said Dick in reply she could use me as I used Binatfor some sort
of a study I wouldnt ask more than to be near her again even though I
knew that another man was making love to her Ugh what a dog I am

A voice on the staircase began to sing joyfully

When we gogogo away from here Our creditors will weep and they
will wail Our absence much regretting when they find that weve been
getting Out of England by next Tuesdays Indian mail

Following the trampling of feet slamming of Torpenhows door and the
sound of voices in strenuous debate some one squeaked And see you
good fellows I have found a new waterbottlefirsclass patenteh
how you say Open himself inside out

Dick sprang to his feet He knew the voice well Thats Cassavetti
come back from the Continent Now I know why Torp went away Theres a
row somewhere andIm out of it

The Nilghai commanded silence in vain Thats for my sake Dick said
bitterly The birds are getting ready to fly and they wouldnt
tell me I can hear MortenSutherland and Mackaye Half the War
Correspondents in London are thereand Im out of it

He stumbled across the landing and plunged into Torpenhows room He
could feel that it was full of men Wheres the trouble said he In
the Balkans at last Why didnt some one tell me

We thought you wouldnt be interested said the Nilghai shamefacedly

Its in the Soudan as usual

You lucky dogs Let me sit here while you talk I shant be a skeleton
at the feastCassavetti where are you Your English is as bad as
ever

Dick was led into a chair He heard the rustle of the maps and the talk
swept forward carrying him with it Everybody spoke at once discussing
press censorships railwayroutes transport watersupply the
capacities of generalsthese in language that would have horrified a
trusting publicranting asserting denouncing and laughing at the
top of their voices There was the glorious certainty of war in the
Soudan at any moment The Nilghai said so and it was well to be in
readiness The Keneu had telegraphed to Cairo for horses Cassavetti
had stolen a perfectly inaccurate list of troops that would be ordered
forward and was reading it out amid profane interruptions and the
Keneu introduced to Dick some man unknown who would be employed as war
artist by the Central Southern Syndicate Its his first outing said
the Keneu Give him some tipsabout riding camels

Oh those camels groaned Cassavetti I shall learn to ride him
again and now I am so much all soft Listen you good fellows I know
your military arrangement very well There will go the Royal Argalshire
Sutherlanders So it was read to me upon best authority

A roar of laughter interrupted him

Sit down said the Nilghai The lists arent even made out in the War
Office

Will there be any force at Suakin said a voice

Then the outcries redoubled and grew mixed thus How many Egyptian
troops will they useGod help the FellaheenTheres a railway
in Plumstead marshes doing duty as a fivescourtWe shall have the
SuakinBerber line built at lastCanadian voyageurs are too careful
Give me a halfdrunk Krooman in a whaleboatWho commands the Desert
columnNo they never blew up the big rock in the Ghineh bend We
shall have to be hauled up as usualSomebody tell me if theres an
Indian contingent or Ill break everybodys headDont tear the
map in twoIts a war of occupation I tell you to connect with the
African companies in the SouthTheres Guineaworm in most of the
wells on that route Then the Nilghai despairing of peace bellowed
like a foghorn and beat upon the table with both hands

But what becomes of Torpenhow said Dick in the silence that
followed

Torps in abeyance just now Hes off lovemaking somewhere I
suppose said the Nilghai

He said he was going to stay at home said the Keneu

Is he said Dick with an oath He wont Im not much good now but
if you and the Nilghai hold him down Ill engage to trample on him till
he sees reason Hell stay behind indeed Hes the best of you all
Therell be some tough work by Omdurman We shall come there to stay
this time

But I forgot I wish I were going with you

So do we all Dickie said the Keneu

And I most of all said the new artist of the Central Southern
Syndicate

Could you tell me

Ill give you one piece of advice Dick answered moving towards
the door If you happen to be cut over the head in a scrimmage dont
guard Tell the man to go on cutting Youll find it cheapest in the
end Thanks for letting me look in

Theres grit in Dick said the Nilghai an hour later when the room
was emptied of all save the Keneu

It was the sacred call of the wartrumpet Did you notice how he
answered to it Poor fellow Lets look at him said the Keneu

The excitement of the talk had died away Dick was sitting by the studio
table with his head on his arms when the men came in He did not
change his position

It hurts he moaned God forgive me but it hurts cruelly and yet
yknow the world has a knack of spinning round all by itself Shall I
see Torp before he goes

Oh yes Youll see him said the Nilghai



CHAPTER XIII

 The sun went down an hour ago
 I wonder if I face towards home
 If I lost my way in the light of day
 How shall I find it now night is come
 Old Song

Maisie come to bed

Its so hot I cant sleep Dont worry

Maisie put her elbows on the windowsill and looked at the moonlight on
the straight poplarflanked road Summer had come upon VitrysurMarne
and parched it to the bone The grass was dryburnt in the meadows the
clay by the bank of the river was caked to brick the roadside flowers
were long since dead and the roses in the garden hung withered on their
stalks The heat in the little low bedroom under the eaves was almost
intolerable The very moonlight on the wall of Kamis studio across
the road seemed to make the night hotter and the shadow of the big
bellhandle by the closed gate cast a bar of inky black that caught
Maisies eye and annoyed her

Horrid thing It should be all white she murmured And the gate
isnt in the middle of the wall either I never noticed that before

Maisie was hard to please at that hour First the heat of the past few
weeks had worn her down secondly her work and particularly the study
of a female head intended to represent the Melancolia and not finished
in time for the Salon was unsatisfactory thirdly Kami had said as
much two days before fourthlybut so completely fourthly that it was
hardly worth thinking aboutDick her property had not written to
her for more than six weeks She was angry with the heat with Kami and
with her work but she was exceedingly angry with Dick

She had written to him three timeseach time proposing a fresh
treatment of her Melancolia Dick had taken no notice of these
communications She had resolved to write no more When she returned
to England in the autumnfor her prides sake she could not return
earliershe would speak to him She missed the Sunday afternoon
conferences more than she cared to admit All that Kami said was
Continuez mademoiselle continuez toujours and he had been repeating
the wearisome counsel through the hot summer exactly like a cicadaan
old gray cicada in a black alpaca coat white trousers and a huge felt
hat

But Dick had tramped masterfully up and down her little studio north
of the cool green London park and had said things ten times worse than
continuez before he snatched the brush out of her hand and showed her
where the error lay His last letter Maisie remembered contained
some trivial advice about not sketching in the sun or drinking water at
wayside farmhouses and he had said that not once but three timesas
if he did not know that Maisie could take care of herself

But what was he doing that he could not trouble to write A murmur of
voices in the road made her lean from the window A cavalryman of the
little garrison in the town was talking to Kamis cook The moonlight
glittered on the scabbard of his sabre which he was holding in his hand
lest it should clank inopportunely The cooks cap cast deep shadows on
her face which was close to the conscripts He slid his arm round her
waist and there followed the sound of a kiss

Faugh said Maisie stepping back

Whats that said the redhaired girl who was tossing uneasily
outside her bed

Only a conscript kissing the cook said Maisie

Theyve gone away now She leaned out of the window again and put a
shawl over her nightgown to guard against chills There was a very small
nightbreeze abroad and a sunbaked rose below nodded its head as one
who knew unutterable secrets Was it possible that Dick should turn his
thoughts from her work and his own and descend to the degradation of
Suzanne and the conscript He could not The rose nodded its head and
one leaf therewith It looked like a naughty little devil scratching its
ear

Dick could not because thought Maisie he is mineminemine He
said he was Im sure I dont care what he does It will only spoil his
work if he does and it will spoil mine too

The rose continued to nod in the futile way peculiar to flowers There
was no earthly reason why Dick should not disport himself as he chose
except that he was called by Providence which was Maisie to assist
Maisie in her work And her work was the preparation of pictures that
went sometimes to English provincial exhibitions as the notices in the
scrapbook proved and that were invariably rejected by the Salon when
Kami was plagued into allowing her to send them up Her work in the
future it seemed would be the preparation of pictures on exactly
similar lines which would be rejected in exactly the same wayThe
redhaired girl threshed distressfully across the sheets Its too hot
to sleep she moaned and the interruption jarred

Exactly the same way Then she would divide her years between the little
studio in England and Kamis big studio at VitrysurMarne No she
would go to another master who should force her into the success that
was her right if patient toil and desperate endeavour gave one a
right to anything Dick had told her that he had worked ten years to
understand his craft She had worked ten years and ten years were
nothing Dick had said that ten years were nothingbut that was in
regard to herself only He had saidthis very man who could not find
time to writethat he would wait ten years for her and that she was
bound to come back to him sooner or later He had said this in the
absurd letter about sunstroke and diphtheria and then he had stopped
writing He was wandering up and down moonlit streets kissing cooks
She would like to lecture him nownot in her nightgown of course
but properly dressed severely and from a height Yet if he was kissing
other girls he certainly would not care whether she lecture him or not
He would laugh at her Very good

She would go back to her studio and prepare pictures that went etc
etc

The millwheel of thought swung round slowly that no section of it
might be slurred over and the redhaired girl tossed and turned behind
her

Maisie put her chin in her hands and decided that there could be no
doubt whatever of the villainy of Dick To justify herself she began
unwomanly to weigh the evidence There was a boy and he had said he
loved her And he kissed herkissed her on the cheekby a yellow
seapoppy that nodded its head exactly like the maddening dry rose in
the garden Then there was an interval and men had told her that they
loved herjust when she was busiest with her work Then the boy came
back and at their very second meeting had told her that he loved her
Then he hadBut there was no end to the things he had done He
had given her his time and his powers He had spoken to her of
Art housekeeping technique teacups the abuse of pickles as a
stimulantthat was rudesable hairbrusheshe had given her the
best in her stockshe used them daily he had given her advice that
she profited by and now and againa look Such a look The look of a
beaten hound waiting for the word to crawl to his mistresss feet In
return she had given him nothing whatever excepthere she brushed her
mouth against the openwork sleeve of her nightgownthe privilege
of kissing her once And on the mouth too Disgraceful Was that not
enough and more than enough and if it was not had he not cancelled
the debt by not writing andprobably kissing other girls Maisie
youll catch a chill Do go and lie down said the wearied voice of her
companion I cant sleep a wink with you at the window

Maisie shrugged her shoulders and did not answer She was reflecting
on the meannesses of Dick and on other meannesses with which he had
nothing to do The moonlight would not let her sleep It lay on the
skylight of the studio across the road in cold silver she stared at it
intently and her thoughts began to slide one into the other The shadow
of the big bellhandle in the wall grew short lengthened again and
faded out as the moon went down behind the pasture and a hare came
limping home across the road Then the dawnwind washed through the
upland grasses and brought coolness with it and the cattle lowed by
the droughtshrunk river Maisies head fell forward on the windowsill
and the tangle of black hair covered her arms

Maisie wake up Youll catch a chill

Yes dear yes dear She staggered to her bed like a wearied child
and as she buried her face in the pillows she muttered I thinkI
thinkBut he ought to have written

Day brought the routine of the studio the smell of paint and
turpentine and the monotone wisdom of Kami who was a leaden artist
but a golden teacher if the pupil were only in sympathy with him Maisie
was not in sympathy that day and she waited impatiently for the end of
the work

She knew when it was coming for Kami would gather his black alpaca
coat into a bunch behind him and with faded flue eyes that saw neither
pupils nor canvas look back into the past to recall the history of one
Binat You have all done not so badly he would say But you shall
remember that it is not enough to have the method and the art and
the power nor even that which is touch but you shall have also
the conviction that nails the work to the wall Of the so many I
taughthere the students would begin to unfix drawingpins or get
their tubes togetherthe very so many that I have taught the best
was Binat All that comes of the study and the work and the knowledge
was to him even when he came After he left me he should have done all
that could be done with the colour the form and the knowledge Only
he had not the conviction So today I hear no more of Binatthe best
of my pupilsand that is long ago So today too you will be glad
to hear no more of me Continuez mesdemoiselles and above all with
conviction

He went into the garden to smoke and mourn over the lost Binat as the
pupils dispersed to their several cottages or loitered in the studio to
make plans for the cool of the afternoon

Maisie looked at her very unhappy Melancolia restrained a desire to
grimace before it and was hurrying across the road to write a letter
to Dick when she was aware of a large man on a white troophorse How
Torpenhow had managed in the course of twenty hours to find his way to
the hearts of the cavalry officers in quarters at VitrysurMarne to
discuss with them the certainty of a glorious revenge for France to
reduce the colonel to tears of pure affability and to borrow the best
horse in the squadron for the journey to Kamis studio is a mystery
that only special correspondents can unravel

I beg your pardon said he It seems an absurd question to ask but
the fact is that I dont know her by any other name Is there any young
lady here that is called Maisie

I am Maisie was the answer from the depths of a great sunhat

I ought to introduce myself he said as the horse capered in the
blinding white dust My name is Torpenhow Dick Heldar is my best
friend andandthe fact is that he has gone blind

Blind said Maisie stupidly He cant be blind

He has been stoneblind for nearly two months

Maisie lifted up her face and it was pearly white No No Not blind
I wont have him blind

Would you care to see for yourself said Torpenhow

Nowat once

Oh no The Paris train doesnt go through this place till tonight
There will be ample time

Did Mr Heldar send you to me

Certainly not Dick wouldnt do that sort of thing Hes sitting in
his studio turning over some letters that he cant read because hes
blind

There was a sound of choking from the sunhat Maisie bowed her head
and went into the cottage where the redhaired girl was on a sofa
complaining of a headache

Dicks blind said Maisie taking her breath quickly as she steadied
herself against a chairback My Dicks blind

What The girl was on the sofa no longer

A man has come from England to tell me He hasnt written to me for six
weeks

Are you going to him

I must think

Think I should go back to London and see him and I should kiss his
eyes and kiss them and kiss them until they got well again If you dont
go I shall Oh what am I talking about You wicked little idiot Go to
him at once Go

Torpenhows neck was blistering but he preserved a smile of infinite
patience as Maisies appeared bareheaded in the sunshine

I am coming said she her eyes on the ground

You will be at Vitry Station then at seven this evening This was
an order delivered by one who was used to being obeyed Maisie said
nothing but she felt grateful that there was no chance of disputing
with this big man who took everything for granted and managed a
squealing horse with one hand She returned to the redhaired girl
who was weeping bitterly and between tears kissesvery few of
thosementhol packing and an interview with Kami the sultry
afternoon wore away

Thought might come afterwards Her present duty was to go to DickDick
who owned the wondrous friend and sat in the dark playing with her
unopened letters

But what will you do she said to her companion

I Oh I shall stay here andfinish your Melancolia she said
smiling pitifully Write to me afterwards

That night there ran a legend through VitrysurMarne of a mad
Englishman doubtless suffering from sunstroke who had drunk all the
officers of the garrison under the table had borrowed a horse from the
lines and had then and there eloped after the English custom with one
of those more mad English girls who drew pictures down there under the
care of that good Monsieur Kami

They are very droll said Suzanne to the conscript in the moonlight
by the studio wall She walked always with those big eyes that saw
nothing and yet she kisses me on both cheeks as though she were my
sister and gives meseeten francs

The conscript levied a contribution on both gifts for he prided himself
on being a good soldier

Torpenhow spoke very little to Maisie during the journey to Calais
but he was careful to attend to all her wants to get her a compartment
entirely to herself and to leave her alone He was amazed of the ease
with which the matter had been accomplished

The safest thing would be to let her think things out By Dicks
showingwhen he was off his headshe must have ordered him about
very thoroughly Wonder how she likes being under orders

Maisie never told She sat in the empty compartment often with her eyes
shut that she might realise the sensation of blindness It was an order
that she should return to London swiftly and she found herself at last
almost beginning to enjoy the situation This was better than looking
after luggage and a redhaired friend who never took any interest in her
surroundings But there appeared to be a feeling in the air that she
Maisieof all peoplewas in disgrace Therefore she justified her
conduct to herself with great success till Torpenhow came up to her
on the steamer and without preface began to tell the story of Dicks
blindness suppressing a few details but dwelling at length on the
miseries of delirium He stopped before he reached the end as though he
had lost interest in the subject and went forward to smoke Maisie was
furious with him and with herself

She was hurried on from Dover to London almost before she could ask for
breakfast andshe was past any feeling of indignation nowwas bidden
curtly to wait in a hall at the foot of some leadcovered stairs while
Torpenhow went up to make inquiries Again the knowledge that she was
being treated like a naughty little girl made her pale cheeks flame It
was all Dicks fault for being so stupid as to go blind

Torpenhow led her up to a shut door which he opened very softly Dick
was sitting by the window with his chin on his chest There were three
envelopes in his hand and he turned them over and over The big man
who gave orders was no longer by her side and the studio door snapped
behind her

Dick thrust the letters into his pocket as he heard the sound Hullo
Torp Is that you Ive been so lonely

His voice had taken the peculiar flatness of the blind Maisie pressed
herself up into a corner of the room Her heart was beating furiously
and she put one hand on her breast to keep it quiet Dick was staring
directly at her and she realised for the first time that he was blind

Shutting her eyes in a railway carriage to open them when she pleased
was childs play This man was blind though his eyes were wide open

Torp is that you They said you were coming Dick looked puzzled and
a little irritated at the silence

No its only me was the answer in a strained little whisper Maisie
could hardly move her lips

Hm said Dick composedly without moving This is a new phenomenon
Darkness Im getting used to but I object to hearing voices

Was he mad then as well as blind that he talked to himself Maisies
heart beat more wildly and she breathed in gasps Dick rose and began
to feel his way across the room touching each table and chair as he
passed Once he caught his foot on a rug and swore dropping on his
knees to feel what the obstruction might be Maisie remembered him
walking in the Park as though all the earth belonged to him tramping
up and down her studio two months ago and flying up the gangway of the
Channel steamer The beating of her heart was making her sick and Dick
was coming nearer guided by the sound of her breathing She put out a
hand mechanically to ward him off or to draw him to herself she did not
know which It touched his chest and he stepped back as though he had
been shot

Its Maisie said he with a dry sob What are you doing here

I cameI cameto see you please

Dicks lips closed firmly

Wont you sit down then You see Ive had some bother with my eyes
and

I know I know Why didnt you tell me

I couldnt write

You might have told Mr Torpenhow

What has he to do with my affairs

Hehe brought me from VitrysurMarne He thought I ought to see you

Why what has happened Can I do anything for you No I cant I
forgot

Oh Dick Im so sorry Ive come to tell you andLet me take you
back to your chair

Dont Im not a child You only do that out of pity I never meant to
tell you anything about it Im no good now Im down and done for Let
me alone

He groped back to his chair his chest labouring as he sat down

Maisie watched him and the fear went out of her heart to be followed
by a very bitter shame He had spoken a truth that had been hidden from
the girl through every step of the impetuous flight to London for he
was indeed down and done formasterful no longer but rather a little
abject neither an artist stronger than she nor a man to be looked up
toonly some blind one that sat in a chair and seemed on the point of
crying She was immensely and unfeignedly sorry for himmore sorry than
she had ever been for any one in her life but not sorry enough to deny
his words

So she stood still and felt ashamed and a little hurt because she had
honestly intended that her journey should end triumphantly and now she
was only filled with pity most startlingly distinct from love

Well said Dick his face steadily turned away I never meant to
worry you any more Whats the matter

He was conscious that Maisie was catching her breath but was as
unprepared as herself for the torrent of emotion that followed She had
dropped into a chair and was sobbing with her face hidden in her hands

I cantI cant she cried desperately Indeed I cant It isnt my
fault Im so sorry Oh Dickie Im so sorry

Dicks shoulders straightened again for the words lashed like a whip

Still the sobbing continued It is not good to realise that you have
failed in the hour of trial or flinched before the mere possibility of
making sacrifices

I do despise myselfindeed I do But I cant Oh Dickie you wouldnt
ask mewould you wailed Maisie

She looked up for a minute and by chance it happened that Dicks eyes
fell on hers The unshaven face was very white and set and the lips
were trying to force themselves into a smile But it was the wornout
eyes that Maisie feared Her Dick had gone blind and left in his place
some one that she could hardly recognise till he spoke

Who is asking you to do anything Maisie I told you how it would be
Whats the use of worrying For pitys sake dont cry like that it
isnt worth it

You dont know how I hate myself Oh Dick help mehelp me The
passion of tears had grown beyond her control and was beginning to alarm
the man He stumbled forward and put his arm round her and her head
fell on his shoulder

Hush dear hush Dont cry Youre quite right and youve nothing to
reproach yourself withyou never had Youre only a little upset by the
journey and I dont suppose youve had any breakfast What a brute Torp
was to bring you over

I wanted to come I did indeed she protested

Very well And now youve come and seen and Imimmensely grateful
When youre better you shall go away and get something to eat What sort
of a passage did you have coming over

Maisie was crying more subduedly for the first time in her life glad
that she had something to lean against Dick patted her on the shoulder
tenderly but clumsily for he was not quite sure where her shoulder
might be

She drew herself out of his arms at last and waited trembling and most
unhappy He had felt his way to the window to put the width of the room
between them and to quiet a little the tumult in his heart

Are you better now he said

Yes butdont you hate me

I hate you My God I

Isntisnt there anything I could do for you then Ill stay here
in England to do it if you like Perhaps I could come and see you
sometimes

I think not dear It would be kindest not to see me any more please
I dont want to seem rude butdont you thinkperhaps you had almost
better go now

He was conscious that he could not bear himself as a man if the strain
continued much longer

I dont deserve anything else Ill go Dick Oh Im so miserable

Nonsense Youve nothing to worry about Id tell you if you had Wait
a moment dear Ive got something to give you first I meant it for
you ever since this little trouble began Its my Melancolia she was a
beauty when I last saw her You can keep her for me and if ever youre
poor you can sell her Shes worth a few hundreds at any state of the
market He groped among his canvases Shes framed in black Is this
a black frame that I have my hand on There she is What do you think of
her

He turned a scarred formless muddle of paint towards Maisie and the
eyes strained as though they would catch her wonder and surprise One
thing and one thing only could she do for him

Well

The voice was fuller and more rounded because the man knew he was
speaking of his best work Maisie looked at the blur and a lunatic
desire to laugh caught her by the throat But for Dicks sakewhatever
this mad blankness might meanshe must make no sign Her voice choked
with hardheld tears as she answered still gazing at the wreckOh
Dick it is good

He heard the little hysterical gulp and took it for tribute Wont you
have it then Ill send it over to your house if you will

I Oh yesthank you Ha ha If she did not fly at once the laughter
that was worse than tears would kill her She turned and ran choking
and blinded down the staircases that were empty of life to take refuge
in a cab and go to her house across the Parks There she sat down in the
dismantled drawingroom and thought of Dick in his blindness useless
till the end of life and of herself in her own eyes Behind the sorrow
the shame and the humiliation lay fear of the cold wrath of the
redhaired girl when Maisie should return Maisie had never feared her
companion before Not until she found herself saying Well he never
asked me did she realise her scorn of herself And that is the end of
Maisie

    

For Dick was reserved more searching torment He could not realise at
first that Maisie whom he had ordered to go had left him without a word
of farewell He was savagely angry against Torpenhow who had brought
upon him this humiliation and troubled his miserable peace Then his
dark hour came and he was alone with himself and his desires to get what
help he could from the darkness The queen could do no wrong but in
following the right so far as it served her work she had wounded her
one subject more than his own brain would let him know

Its all I had and Ive lost it he said as soon as the misery
permitted clear thinking And Torp will think that he has been so
infernally clever that I shant have the heart to tell him I must think
this out quietly

Hullo said Torpenhow entering the studio after Dick had enjoyed two
hours of thought Im back Are you feeling any better

Torp I dont know what to say Come here Dick coughed huskily
wondering indeed what he should say and how to say it temperately

Whats the need for saying anything Get up and tramp Torpenhow was
perfectly satisfied

They walked up and down as of custom Torpenhows hand on Dicks
shoulder and Dick buried in his own thoughts

How in the world did you find it all out said Dick at last

You shouldnt go off your head if you want to keep secrets Dickie It
was absolutely impertinent on my part but if youd seen me rocketing
about on a halftrained French troophorse under a blazing sun youd
have laughed There will be a charivari in my rooms tonight Seven other
devils

I knowthe row in the Southern Soudan I surprised their councils the
other day and it made me unhappy Have you fixed your flint to go Who
dyou work for

Havent signed any contracts yet I wanted to see how your business
would turn out

Would you have stayed with me then ifthings had gone wrong He put
his question cautiously

Dont ask me too much Im only a man

Youve tried to be an angel very successfully

Oh yees Well do you attend the function tonight We shall
be half screwed before the morning All the men believe the wars a
certainty

I dont think I will old man if its all the same to you Ill stay
quiet here

And meditate I dont blame you You observe a good time if ever a man
did

That night there was a tumult on the stairs The correspondents poured
in from theatre dinner and musichall to Torpenhows room that they
might discuss their plan of campaign in the event of military operations
becoming a certainty Torpenhow the Keneu and the Nilghai had bidden
all the men they had worked with to the orgy and Mr Beeton the
housekeeper declared that never before in his checkered experience had
he seen quite such a fancy lot of gentlemen They waked the chambers
with shoutings and song and the elder men were quite as bad as the
younger For the chances of war were in front of them and all knew what
those meant

Sitting in his own room a little perplexed by the noise across the
landing Dick suddenly began to laugh to himself

When one comes to think of it the situation is intensely comic
Maisies quite rightpoor little thing I didnt know she could cry
like that before but now I know what Torp thinks Im sure hed be
quite fool enough to stay at home and try to console meif he knew
Besides it isnt nice to own that youve been thrown over like a broken
chair I must carry this business through aloneas usual If there
isnt a war and Torp finds out I shall look foolish thats all If
there is a way I mustnt interfere with another mans chances Business
is business and I want to be aloneI want to be alone What a row
theyre making

Somebody hammered at the studio door

Come out and frolic Dickie said the Nilghai

I should like to but I cant Im not feeling frolicsome

Then Ill tell the boys and theyll drag you like a badger

Please not old man On my word Id sooner be left alone just now

Very good Can we send anything in to you Fizz for instance
Cassavetti is beginning to sing songs of the Sunny South already

For one minute Dick considered the proposition seriously

No thanks Ive a headache already

Virtuous child Thats the effect of emotion on the young All my
congratulations Dick I also was concerned in the conspiracy for your
welfare

Go to the deviloh send Binkie in here

The little dog entered on elastic feet riotous from having been
made much of all the evening He had helped to sing the choruses
but scarcely inside the studio he realised that this was no place for
tailwagging and settled himself on Dicks lap till it was bedtime
Then he went to bed with Dick who counted every hour as it struck and
rose in the morning with a painfully clear head to receive Torpenhows
more formal congratulations and a particular account of the last nights
revels

You arent looking very happy for a newly accepted man said
Torpenhow

Never mind thatits my own affair and Im all right Do you really
go

Yes With the old Central Southern as usual They wired and I accepted
on better terms than before

When do you start

The day after tomorrowfor Brindisi

Thank God Dick spoke from the bottom of his heart

Well thats not a pretty way of saying youre glad to get rid of me
But men in your condition are allowed to be selfish

I didnt mean that Will you get a hundred pounds cashed for me before
you leave

Thats a slender amount for housekeeping isnt it

Oh its only formarriage expenses

Torpenhow brought him the money counted it out in fives and tens and
carefully put it away in the writing table

Now I suppose I shall have to listen to his ravings about his girl
until I go Heaven send us patience with a man in love he said to
himself

But never a word did Dick say of Maisie or marriage He hung in the
doorway of Torpenhows room when the latter was packing and asked
innumerable questions about the coming campaign till Torpenhow began to
feel annoyed

Youre a secretive animal Dickie and you consume your own smoke
dont you he said on the last evening

II suppose so By the way how long do you think this war will last

Days weeks or months One can never tell It may go on for years

I wish I were going

Good Heavens Youre the most unaccountable creature Hasnt it
occurred to you that youre going to be marriedthanks to me

Of course yes Im going to be marriedso I am Going to be married
Im awfully grateful to you Havent I told you that

You might be going to be hanged by the look of you said Torpenhow

And the next day Torpenhow bade him goodbye and left him to the
loneliness he had so much desired



CHAPTER XIV

 Yet at the last ere our spearmen had found him
 Yet at the last ere a swordthrust could save
 Yet at the last with his masters around him
 He of the Faith spoke as master to slave
 Yet at the last tho the Kafirs had maimed him
 Broken by bondage and wrecked by the reiver
 Yet at the last tho the darkness had claimed him
 He called upon Allah and died a believerKizzilbashi

Beg your pardon Mr Heldar butbut isnt nothin going to happen
said Mr Beeton

No Dick had just waked to another morning of blank despair and his
temper was of the shortest

Taint my regular business o course sir and what I say is Mind
your own business and let other people mind theirs but just before Mr
Torpenhow went away he give me to understand like that you might be
moving into a house of your own so to speaka sort of house with rooms
upstairs and downstairs where youd be better attended to though I try
to act just by all our tenants Dont I

Ah That must have been a madhouse I shant trouble you to take me
there yet Get me my breakfast please and leave me alone

I hope I havent done anything wrong sir but you know I hope that as
far as a man can I tries to do the proper thing by all the gentlemen in
chambersand more particular those whose lot is hardsuch as you for
instance Mr Heldar You likes softroe bloater dont you Softroe
bloaters is scarcer than hardroe but what I says is Never mind a
little extra trouble so long as you give satisfaction to the tenants

Mr Beeton withdrew and left Dick to himself Torpenhow had been long
away there was no more rioting in the chambers and Dick had settled
down to his new life which he was weak enough to consider nothing
better than death

It is hard to live alone in the dark confusing the day and night
dropping to sleep through sheer weariness at midday and rising
restless in the chill of the dawn At first Dick on his awakenings
would grope along the corridors of the chambers till he heard some one
snore Then he would know that the day had not yet come and return
wearily to his bedroom

Later he learned not to stir till there was a noise and movement in the
house and Mr Beeton advised him to get up Once dressedand dressing
now that Torpenhow was away was a lengthy business because collars
ties and the like hid themselves in far corners of the room and search
meant headbeating against chairs and trunksonce dressed there was
nothing whatever to do except to sit still and brood till the three
daily meals came Centuries separated breakfast from lunch and lunch
from dinner and though a man prayed for hundreds of years that his
mind might be taken from him God would never hear Rather the mind
was quickened and the revolving thoughts ground against each other as
millstones grind when there is no corn between and yet the brain would
not wear out and give him rest It continued to think at length with
imagery and all manner of reminiscences It recalled Maisie and past
success reckless travels by land and sea the glory of doing work and
feeling that it was good and suggested all that might have happened had
the eyes only been faithful to their duty When thinking ceased
through sheer weariness there poured into Dicks soul tide on tide of
overwhelming purposeless feardread of starvation always terror
lest the unseen ceiling should crush down upon him fear of fire in the
chambers and a louses death in red flame and agonies of fiercer horror
that had nothing to do with any fear of death Then Dick bowed his head
and clutching the arms of his chair fought with his sweating self till
the tinkle of plates told him that something to eat was being set before
him

Mr Beeton would bring the meal when he had time to spare and
Dick learned to hang upon his speech which dealt with badly fitted
gasplugs wastepipes out of repair little tricks for driving
picturenails into walls and the sins of the charwoman or the
housemaids In the lack of better things the small gossip of a servants
hall becomes immensely interesting and the screwing of a washer on a
tap an event to be talked over for days

Once or twice a week too Mr Beeton would take Dick out with him when
he went marketing in the morning to haggle with tradesmen over fish
lampwicks mustard tapioca and so forth while Dick rested his weight
first on one foot and then on the other and played aimlessly with the
tins and stringball on the counter Then they would perhaps meet one of
Mr Beetons friends and Dick standing aside a little would hold his
peace till Mr Beeton was willing to go on again

The life did not increase his selfrespect He abandoned shaving as a
dangerous exercise and being shaved in a barbers shop meant exposure
of his infirmity He could not see that his clothes were properly
brushed and since he had never taken any care of his personal
appearance he became every known variety of sloven A blind man cannot
deal with cleanliness till he has been some months used to the darkness
If he demand attendance and grow angry at the want of it he must assert
himself and stand upright Then the meanest menial can see that he is
blind and therefore of no consequence A wise man will keep his eyes
on the floor and sit still For amusement he may pick coal lump by lump
out of the scuttle with the tongs and pile it in a little heap in the
fender keeping count of the lumps which must all be put back again
one by one and very carefully He may set himself sums if he cares to
work them out he may talk to himself or to the cat if she chooses to
visit him and if his trade has been that of an artist he may sketch
in the air with his forefinger but that is too much like drawing a pig
with the eyes shut He may go to his bookshelves and count his books
ranging them in order of their size or to his wardrobe and count his
shirts laying them in piles of two or three on the bed as they suffer
from frayed cuffs or lost buttons

Even this entertainment wearies after a time and all the times are
very very long

Dick was allowed to sort a toolchest where Mr Beeton kept hammers
taps and nuts lengths of gaspipes oilbottles and string

If I dont have everything just where I know where to look for it why
then I cant find anything when I do want it Youve no idea sir the
amount of little things that these chambers uses up said Mr Beeton

Fumbling at the handle of the door as he went out Its hard on you
sir I do think its hard on you Aint you going to do anything sir

Ill pay my rent and messing Isnt that enough

I wasnt doubting for a moment that you couldnt pay your way sir but
I ave often said to my wife Its ard on im because it isnt as
if he was an old man nor yet a middleaged one but quite a young
gentleman Thats where it comes so ard

I suppose so said Dick absently This particular nerve through long
battering had ceased to feelmuch

I was thinking continued Mr Beeton still making as if to go that
you might like to hear my boy Alf read you the papers sometimes of an
evening He do read beautiful seeing hes only nine

I should be very grateful said Dick Only let me make it worth his
while

We wasnt thinking of that sir but of course its in your own ands
but only to ear Alf sing A Boys best Friend is is Mother Ah

Ill hear him sing that too Let him come this evening with the
newspapers

Alf was not a nice child being puffed up with many schoolboard
certificates for good conduct and inordinately proud of his singing
Mr Beeton remained beaming while the child wailed his way through
a song of some eight eightline verses in the usual whine of a young
Cockney and after compliments left him to read Dick the foreign
telegrams Ten minutes later Alf returned to his parents rather pale and
scared

E said e couldnt stand it no more he explained

He never said you read badly Alf Mrs Beeton spoke

No E said I read beautiful Said e never eard any one read like
that but e said e couldnt abide the stuff in the papers

Praps hes lost some money in the Stocks Were you readin him about
Stocks Alf

No it was all about fightin out there where the soldiers is gonea
great long piece with all the lines close together and very hard words
in it E give me arf a crown because I read so well And e says the
next time theres anything e wants read ell send for me

Thats good hearing but I do think for all the halfcrownput it into
the kickingdonkey moneybox Alf and let me see you do ithe might
have kept you longer Why he couldnt have begun to understand how
beautiful you read

Hes best left to hisselfgentlemen always are when theyre
downhearted said Mr Beeton

Alfs rigorously limited powers of comprehending Torpenhows special
correspondence had waked the devil of unrest in Dick He could hear
through the boys nasal chant the camels grunting in the squares behind
the soldiers outside Suakin could hear the men swearing and chaffing
across the cooking pots and could smell the acrid woodsmoke as it
drifted over camp before the wind of the desert

That night he prayed to God that his mind might be taken from him
offering for proof that he was worthy of this favour the fact that he
had not shot himself long ago That prayer was not answered and indeed
Dick knew in his heart of hearts that only a lingering sense of humour
and no special virtue had kept him alive Suicide he had persuaded
himself would be a ludicrous insult to the gravity of the situation as
well as a weakkneed confession of fear

Just for the fun of the thing he said to the cat who had taken
Binkies place in his establishment I should like to know how long
this is going to last I can live for a year on the hundred pounds
Torp cashed for me I must have two or three thousand at least in the
Banktwenty or thirty years more provided for that is to say Then I
fall back on my hundred and twenty a year which will be more by that
time Lets consider

Twentyfivethirtyfivea mans in his prime then they
sayfortyfivea middleaged man just entering politicsfiftyfive
died at the comparatively early age of fiftyfive according to the
newspapers Bah How these Christians funk death Sixtyfivewere only
getting on in years Seventyfive is just possible though Great hell
cat O fifty years more of solitary confinement in the dark Youll die
and Beeton will die and Torp will die and Maieverybody else will
die but I shall be alive and kicking with nothing to do Im very sorry
for myself I should like some one else to be sorry for me Evidently
Im not going mad before I die but the pains just as bad as ever
Some day when youre vivisected cat O theyll tie you down on a little
table and cut you openbut dont be afraid theyll take precious good
care that you dont die Youll live and youll be very sorry then that
you werent sorry for me Perhaps Torp will come back or I wish I
could go to Torp and the Nilghai even though I were in their way

Pussy left the room before the speech was ended and Alf as he entered
found Dick addressing the empty hearthrug

Theres a letter for you sir he said Perhaps youd like me to read
it

Lend it to me for a minute and Ill tell you

The outstretched hand shook just a little and the voice was not
oversteady It was within the limits of human possibility thatthat
was no letter from Maisie He knew the heft of three closed envelopes
only too well It was a foolish hope that the girl should write to
him for he did not realise that there is a wrong which admits of no
reparation though the evildoer may with tears and the hearts best love
strive to mend all It is best to forget that wrong whether it be caused
or endured since it is as remediless as bad work once put forward

Read it then said Dick and Alf began intoning according to the
rules of the Board SchoolI could have given you love I could have
given you loyalty such as you never dreamed of Do you suppose I cared
what you were But you chose to whistle everything down the wind for
nothing My only excuse for you is that you are so young Thats all
he said returning the paper to be dropped into the fire

What was in the letter asked Mrs Beeton when Alf returned

I dont know I think it was a circular or a tract about not whistlin
at everything when youre young

I must have stepped on something when I was alive and walking about and
it has bounced up and hit me God help it whatever it isunless it was
all a joke But I dont know any one whod take the trouble to play a
joke on meLove and loyalty for nothing It sounds tempting enough I
wonder whether I have lost anything really

Dick considered for a long time but could not remember when or how he
had put himself in the way of winning these trifles at a womans hands

Still the letter as touching on matters that he preferred not to think
about stung him into a fit of frenzy that lasted for a day and night
When his heart was so full of despair that it would hold no more
body and soul together seemed to be dropping without check through the
darkness

Then came fear of darkness and desperate attempts to reach the light
again But there was no light to be reached When that agony had left
him sweating and breathless the downward flight would recommence till
the gathering torture of it spurred him into another fight as hopeless
as the first Followed some few minutes of sleep in which he dreamed
that he saw Then the procession of events would repeat itself till he
was utterly worn out and the brain took up its everlasting consideration
of Maisie and mighthavebeens

At the end of everything Mr Beeton came to his room and volunteered to
take him out Not marketing this time but well go into the Parks if
you like

Be damned if I do quoth Dick Keep to the streets and walk up and
down I like to hear the people round me

This was not altogether true The blind in the first stages of their
infirmity dislike those who can move with a free stride and unlifted
armsbut Dick had no earthly desire to go to the Parks Once and
only once since Maisie had shut her door he had gone there under Alfs
charge Alf forgot him and fished for minnows in the Serpentine with
some companions After half an hours waiting Dick almost weeping with
rage and wrath caught a passerby who introduced him to a friendly
policeman who led him to a fourwheeler opposite the Albert Hall He
never told Mr Beeton of Alfs forgetfulness but this was not the
manner in which he was used to walk the Parks aforetime

What streets would you like to walk down then said Mr Beeton
sympathetically His own ideas of a riotous holiday meant picnicking
on the grass of Green Park with his family and half a dozen paper bags
full of food

Keep to the river said Dick and they kept to the river and the rush
of it was in his ears till they came to Blackfriars Bridge and struck
thence on to the Waterloo Road Mr Beeton explaining the beauties of
the scenery as he went on

And walking on the other side of the pavement said he unless Im
much mistaken is the young woman that used to come to your rooms to
be drawed I never forgets a face and I never remembers a name except
paying tenants o course

Stop her said Dick Its Bessie Broke Tell her Id like to speak to
her again Quick man

Mr Beeton crossed the road under the noses of the omnibuses and
arrested Bessie then on her way northward She recognised him as the
man in authority who used to glare at her when she passed up Dicks
staircase and her first impulse was to run

Wasnt you Mr Heldars model said Mr Beeton planting himself in
front of her You was Hes on the other side of the road and hed like
to see you

Why said Bessie faintly She rememberedindeed had never for long
forgottenan affair connected with a newly finished picture

Because he has asked me to do so and because hes most particular
blind

Drunk

No Orspital blind He cant see Thats him over there

Dick was leaning against the parapet of the bridge as Mr Beeton pointed
him outa stubbearded bowed creature wearing a dirty magentacoloured
neckcloth outside an unbrushed coat There was nothing to fear from such
an one Even if he chased her Bessie thought he could not follow far
She crossed over and Dicks face lighted up It was long since a woman
of any kind had taken the trouble to speak to him

I hope youre well Mr Heldar said Bessie a little puzzled Mr
Beeton stood by with the air of an ambassador and breathed responsibly

Im very well indeed and by Jove Im glad to seehear you I mean
Bess You never thought it worth while to turn up and see us again after
you got your money I dont know why you should Are you going anywhere
in particular just now

I was going for a walk said Bessie

Not the old business Dick spoke under his breath

Lor no I paid my premiumBessie was very proud of that wordfor a
barmaid sleeping in and Im at the bar now quite respectable Indeed I
am

Mr Beeton had no special reason to believe in the loftiness of human
nature Therefore he dissolved himself like a mist and returned to his
gasplugs without a word of apology Bessie watched the flight with a
certain uneasiness but so long as Dick appeared to be ignorant of the
harm that had been done to him

Its hard work pulling the beerhandles she went on and theyve got
one of them pennyintheslot cashmachines so if you get wrong by a
penny at the end of the daybut then I dont believe the machinery is
right Do you

Ive only seen it work Mr Beeton

Hes gone

Im afraid I must ask you to help me home then Ill make it worth
your while You see The sightless eyes turned towards her and Bessie
saw

It isnt taking you out of your way he said hesitatingly I can ask
a policeman if it is

Not at all I come on at seven and Im off at four Thats easy hours

Good Godbut Im on all the time I wish I had some work to do too
Lets go home Bess

He turned and cannoned into a man on the sidewalk recoiling with an
oath Bessie took his arm and said nothingas she had said nothing when
he had ordered her to turn her face a little more to the light They
walked for some time in silence the girl steering him deftly through
the crowd

And whereswheres Mr Torpenhow she inquired at last

He has gone away to the desert

Wheres that

Dick pointed to the right Eastout of the mouth of the river said
he

Then west then south and then east again all along the underside
of Europe Then south again God knows how far The explanation did
not enlighten Bessie in the least but she held her tongue and looked to
Dicks patch till they came to the chambers

Well have tea and muffins he said joyously I cant tell you
Bessie how glad I am to find you again What made you go away so
suddenly

I didnt think youd want me any more she said emboldened by his
ignorance

I didnt as a matter of factbut afterwardsAt any rate Im glad
youve come You know the stairs

So Bessie led him home to his own placethere was no one to hinderand
shut the door of the studio

What a mess was her first word All these things havent been looked
after for months and months

No only weeks Bess You cant expect them to care

I dont know what you expect them to do They ought to know what youve
paid them for The dusts just awful Its all over the easel

I dont use it much now

All over the pictures and the floor and all over your coat Id like
to speak to them housemaids

Ring for tea then Dick felt his way to the one chair he used by
custom

Bessie saw the action and as far as in her lay was touched But there
remained always a keen sense of newfound superiority and it was in her
voice when she spoke

How long have you been like this she said wrathfully as though the
blindness were some fault of the housemaids

How

As you are

The day after you went away with the check almost as soon as my
picture was finished I hardly saw her alive

Then theyve been cheating you ever since thats all I know their
nice little ways

A woman may love one man and despise another but on general feminine
principles she will do her best to save the man she despises from being
defrauded Her loved one can look to himself but the other man being
obviously an idiot needs protection

I dont think Mr Beeton cheats much said Dick Bessie was flouncing
up and down the room and he was conscious of a keen sense of enjoyment
as he heard the swish of her skirts and the light step between

Tea and muffins she said shortly when the ring at the bell was
answered two teaspoonfuls and one over for the pot I dont want
the old teapot that was here when I used to come It dont draw Get
another

The housemaid went away scandalised and Dick chuckled Then he began to
cough as Bessie banged up and down the studio disturbing the dust

What are you trying to do

Put things straight This is like unfurnished lodgings How could you
let it go so

How could I help it Dust away

She dusted furiously and in the midst of all the pother entered Mrs
Beeton Her husband on his return had explained the situation winding
up with the peculiarly felicitous proverb Do unto others as you would
be done by She had descended to put into her place the person who
demanded muffins and an uncracked teapot as though she had a right to
both

Muffins ready yet said Bess still dusting She was no longer a drab
of the streets but a young lady who thanks to Dicks check had paid
her premium and was entitled to pull beerhandles with the best Being
neatly dressed in black she did not hesitate to face Mrs Beeton and
there passed between the two women certain regards that Dick would have
appreciated The situation adjusted itself by eye Bessie had won and
Mrs Beeton returned to cook muffins and make scathing remarks about
models hussies trollops and the like to her husband

Theres nothing to be got of interfering with him Liza he said
Alf you go along into the street to play When he isnt crossed hes
as kindly as kind but when hes crossed hes the devil and all We took
too many little things out of his rooms since he was blind to be that
particular about what he does They aint no objects to a blind man of
course but if it was to come into court wed get the sack Yes I did
introduce him to that girl because Im a feelin man myself

Much too feelin Mrs Beeton slapped the muffins into the dish and
thought of comely housemaids long since dismissed on suspicion

I aint ashamed of it and it isnt for us to judge him hard so long
as he pays quiet and regular as he do I know how to manage young
gentlemen you know how to cook for them and what I says is let each
stick to his own business and then there wont be any trouble Take them
muffins down Liza and be sure you have no words with that young woman
His lot is cruel hard and if hes crossed he do swear worse than any
one Ive ever served

Thats a little better said Bessie sitting down to the tea You
neednt wait thank you Mrs Beeton

I had no intention of doing such I do assure you

Bessie made no answer whatever This she knew was the way in
which real ladies routed their foes and when one is a barmaid at a
firstclass publichouse one may become a real lady at ten minutes
notice

Her eyes fell on Dick opposite her and she was both shocked and
displeased There were droppings of food all down the front of his
coat the mouth under the ragged illgrown beard drooped sullenly the
forehead was lined and contracted and on the lean temples the hair was
a dusty indeterminate colour that might or might not have been called
gray The utter misery and selfabandonment of the man appealed to
her and at the bottom of her heart lay the wicked feeling that he was
humbled and brought low who had once humbled her

Oh it is good to hear you moving about said Dick rubbing his hands
Tell us all about your bar successes Bessie and the way you live
now

Never mind that Im quite respectable as youd see by looking at me
You dont seem to live too well What made you go blind that sudden Why
isnt there any one to look after you

Dick was too thankful for the sound of her voice to resent the tone of
it

I was cut across the head a long time ago and that ruined my eyes I
dont suppose anybody thinks it worth while to look after me any more
Why should theyand Mr Beeton really does everything I want

Dont you know any gentlemen and ladies then while you waswell

A few but I dont care to have them looking at me

I suppose thats why youve growed a beard Take it off it dont
become you

Good gracious child do you imagine that I think of what becomes of me
these days

You ought Get that taken off before I come here again I suppose I can
come cant I

Id be only too grateful if you did I dont think I treated you very
well in the old days I used to make you angry

Very angry you did

Im sorry for it then Come and see me when you can and as often as
you can God knows there isnt a soul in the world to take that trouble
except you and Mr Beeton

A lot of trouble hes taking and she too This with a toss of the
head

Theyve let you do anyhow and they havent done anything for you Ive
only to look and see that much Ill come and Ill be glad to come but
you must go and be shaved and you must get some other clothesthose
ones arent fit to be seen

I have heaps somewhere he said helplessly

I know you have Tell Mr Beeton to give you a new suit and Ill brush
it and keep it clean You may be as blind as a barndoor Mr Heldar
but it doesnt excuse you looking like a sweep

Do I look like a sweep then

Oh Im sorry for you Im that sorry for you she cried impulsively
and took Dicks hands Mechanically he lowered his head as if to
kissshe was the only woman who had taken pity on him and he was not
too proud for a little pity now She stood up to go

Nothing o that kind till you look more like a gentleman Its quite
easy when you get shaved and some clothes

He could hear her drawing on her gloves and rose to say goodbye She
passed behind him kissed him audaciously on the back of the neck and
ran away as swiftly as on the day when she had destroyed the Melancolia

To think of me kissing Mr Heldar she said to herself after all
hes done to me and all Well Im sorry for him and if he was shaved
he wouldnt be so bad to look at but Oh them Beetons how
shameful theyve treated him I know Beetons wearing his shirt on his
back today just as well as if Id aired it Tomorrow Ill see I
wonder if he has much of his own It might be worth more than the barI
wouldnt have to do any workand just as respectable as if no one
knew

Dick was not grateful to Bessie for her parting gift He was acutely
conscious of it in the nape of his neck throughout the night but it
seemed among very many other things to enforce the wisdom of getting
shaved

He was shaved accordingly in the morning and felt the better for it A
fresh suit of clothes white linen and the knowledge that some one in
the world said that she took an interest in his personal appearance made
him carry himself almost upright for the brain was relieved for a while
from thinking of Maisie who under other circumstances might have
given that kiss and a million others

Let us consider said he after lunch The girl cant care and its
a tossup whether she comes again or not but if money can buy her to
look after me she shall be bought Nobody else in the world would take
the trouble and I can make it worth her while Shes a child of the
gutter holding brevet rank as a barmaid so she shall have everything
she wants if shell only come and talk and look after me He rubbed his
newly shorn chin and began to perplex himself with the thought of her
not coming I suppose I did look rather a sweep he went on I had
no reason to look otherwise I knew things dropped on my clothes but
it didnt matter It would be cruel if she didnt come She must Maisie
came once and that was enough for her She was quite right She had
something to work for This creature has only beerhandles to pull
unless she has deluded some young man into keeping company with her
Fancy being cheated for the sake of a counterjumper Were falling
pretty low

Something cried aloud within himThis will hurt more than anything
that has gone before It will recall and remind and suggest and
tantalise and in the end drive you mad

I know it I know it Dick cried clenching his hands despairingly
but good heavens is a poor blind beggar never to get anything out of
his life except three meals a day and a greasy waistcoat I wish shed
come

Early in the afternoon time she came because there was no young man in
her life just then and she thought of material advantages which would
allow her to be idle for the rest of her days

I shouldnt have known you she said approvingly You look as you
used to looka gentleman that was proud of himself

Dont you think I deserve another kiss then said Dick flushing a
little

Maybebut you wont get it yet Sit down and lets see what I can do
for you Im certain sure Mr Beeton cheats you now that you cant go
through the housekeeping books every month Isnt that true

Youd better come and housekeep for me then Bessie

Couldnt do it in these chambersyou know that as well as I do

I know but we might go somewhere else if you thought it worth your
while

Id try to look after you anyhow but I shouldnt care to have to work
for both of us This was tentative

Dick laughed

Do you remember where I used to keep my bankbook said he Torp took
it to be balanced just before he went away Look and see

It was generally under the tobaccojar Ah

Well

Oh Four thousand two hundred and ten pounds nine shillings and a
penny Oh my

You can have the penny Thats not bad for one years work Is that and
a hundred and twenty pounds a year good enough

The idleness and the pretty clothes were almost within her reach now
but she must by being housewifely show that she deserved them

Yes but youd have to move and if we took an inventory I think wed
find that Mr Beeton has been prigging little things out of the rooms
here and there They dont look as full as they used

Never mind well let him have them The only thing Im particularly
anxious to take away is that picture I used you forwhen you used to
swear at me Well pull out of this place Bess and get away as far as
ever we can

Oh yes she said uneasily

I dont know where I can go to get away from myself but Ill try
and you shall have all the pretty frocks that you care for Youll like
that Give me that kiss now Bess Ye gods its good to put ones arm
round a womans waist again

Then came the fulfilment of the prophecy within the brain If his arm
were thus round Maisies waist and a kiss had just been given and
taken between themwhy then He pressed the girl more closely to
himself because the pain whipped him She was wondering how to explain
a little accident to the Melancolia At any rate if this man really
desired the solace of her companyand certainly he would relapse into
his original slough if she withdrew ithe would not be more than just a
little vexed

It would be delightful at least to see what would happen and by
her teachings it was good for a man to stand in certain awe of his
companion

She laughed nervously and slipped out of his reach

I shouldnt worrit about that picture if I was you she began in the
hope of turning his attention

Its at the back of all my canvases somewhere Find it Bess you know
it as well as I do

I knowbut

But what Youve wit enough to manage the sale of it to a dealer
Women haggle much better than men It might be a matter of eight or nine
hundred pounds toto us I simply didnt like to think about it for
a long time It was mixed up with my life soBut well cover up
our tracks and get rid of everything eh Make a fresh start from the
beginning Bess

Then she began to repent very much indeed because she knew the value of
money Still it was probable that the blind man was overestimating the
value of his work Gentlemen she knew were absurdly particular about
their things She giggled as a nervous housemaid giggles when she tries
to explain the breakage of a pipe

Im very sorry but you remember I wasI was angry with you before Mr
Torpenhow went away

You were very angry child and on my word I think you had some right
to be

Then Ibut arent you sure Mr Torpenhow didnt tell you

Tell me what Good gracious what are you making such a fuss about when
you might just as well be giving me another kiss

He was beginning to learn not for the first time in his experience
that kissing is a cumulative poison The more you get of it the more
you want

Bessie gave the kiss promptly whispering as she did so I was so
angry I rubbed out that picture with the turpentine You arent angry
are you

What Say that again The mans hand had closed on her wrist

I rubbed it out with turps and the knife faltered Bessie I thought
youd only have to do it over again You did do it over again didnt
you Oh let go of my wrist youre hurting me

Isnt there anything left of the thing

Nnothing that looks like anything Im sorryI didnt know youd take
on about it I only meant to do it in fun You arent going to hit me

Hit you No Lets think

He did not relax his hold upon her wrist but stood staring at the
carpet

Then he shook his head as a young steer shakes it when the lash of the
stockwhip cross his nose warns him back to the path on to the shambles
that he would escape For weeks he had forced himself not to think of
the Melancolia because she was a part of his dead life With Bessies
return and certain new prospects that had developed themselves the
Melancolialovelier in his imagination than she had ever been on
canvasreappeared By her aid he might have procured more money
wherewith to amuse Bess and to forget Maisie as well as another
taste of an almost forgotten success Now thanks to a vicious little
housemaids folly there was nothing to look fornot even the hope that
he might some day take an abiding interest in the housemaid Worst of
all he had been made to appear ridiculous in Maisies eyes A woman
will forgive the man who has ruined her lifes work so long as he gives
her love a man may forgive those who ruin the love of his life but he
will never forgive the destruction of his work

Tcktcktck said Dick between his teeth and then laughed softly
Its an omen Bessie anda good many things considered it serves me
right for doing what I have done By Jove that accounts for Maisies
running away She must have thought me perfectly madsmall blame to
her The whole picture ruined isnt it so What made you do it

Because I was that angry Im not angry nowIm awful sorry

I wonderIt doesnt matter anyhow Im to blame for making the
mistake

What mistake

Something you wouldnt understand dear Great heavens to think that
a little piece of dirt like you could throw me out of stride Dick was
talking to himself as Bessie tried to shake off his grip on her wrist

I aint a piece of dirt and you shouldnt call me so I did it cause
I hated you and Im only sorry now cause youre cause youre

Exactlybecause Im blind Theres noting like tact in little things

Bessie began to sob She did not like being shackled against her will
she was afraid of the blind face and the look upon it and was sorry too
that her great revenge had only made Dick laugh

Dont cry he said and took her into his arms You only did what you
thought right

II aint a little piece of dirt and if you say that Ill never come
to you again

You dont know what youve done to me Im not angryindeed Im not
Be quiet for a minute

Bessie remained in his arms shrinking Dicks first thought was
connected with Maisie and it hurt him as whitehot iron hurts an open
sore

Not for nothing is a man permitted to ally himself to the wrong woman

The first pangthe first sense of things lost is but the prelude to
the play for the very just Providence who delights in causing pain has
decreed that the agony shall return and that in the midst of keenest
pleasure

They know this pain equally who have forsaken or been forsaken by
the love of their life and in their new wives arms are compelled to
realise it

It is better to remain alone and suffer only the misery of being alone
so long as it is possible to find distraction in daily work When that
resource goes the man is to be pitied and left alone

These things and some others Dick considered while he was holding Bessie
to his heart

Though you maynt know it he said raising his head the Lord is a
just and a terrible God Bess with a very strong sense of humour It
serves me righthow it serves me right Torp could understand it if
he were here he must have suffered something at your hands child but
only for a minute or so I saved him Set that to my credit some one

Let me go said Bess her face darkening Let me go

All in good time Did you ever attend Sunday school

Never Let me go I tell you youre making fun of me

Indeed Im not Im making fun of myself Thus He saved
others himself he cannot save It isnt exactly a schoolboard text
He released her wrist but since he was between her and the door she
could not escape What an enormous amount of mischief one little woman
can do

Im sorry Im awful sorry about the picture

Im not Im grateful to you for spoiling it What were we
talking about before you mentioned the thing

About getting awayand money Me and you going away

Of course We will get awaythat is to say I will

And me

You shall have fifty whole pounds for spoiling a picture

Then you wont

Im afraid not dear Think of fifty pounds for pretty things all to
yourself

You said you couldnt do anything without me

That was true a little while ago Im better now thank you Get me my
hat

Spose I dont

Beeton will and youll lose fifty pounds Thats all Get it

Bessie cursed under her breath She had pitied the man sincerely had
kissed him with almost equal sincerity for he was not unhandsome it
pleased her to be in a way and for a time his protector and above all
there were four thousand pounds to be handled by some one Now through
a slip of the tongue and a little feminine desire to give a little
not too much pain she had lost the money the blessed idleness and the
pretty things the companionship and the chance of looking outwardly as
respectable as a real lady

Now fill me a pipe Tobacco doesnt taste but it doesnt matter and
Ill think things out Whats the day of the week Bess

Tuesday

Then Thursdays mailday What a foolwhat a blind fool I have been
Twentytwo pounds covers my passage home again Allow ten for additional
expenses We must put up at Madam Binats for old times sake
Thirtytwo pounds altogether Add a hundred for the cost of the last
tripGad wont Torp stare to see mea hundred and thirtytwo leaves
seventyeight for baksheeshI shall need itand to play with What
are you crying for Bess It wasnt your fault child it was mine
altogether Oh you funny little opossum mop your eyes and take me out
I want the passbook and the checkbook Stop a minute Four thousand
pounds at four per centthats safe interestmeans a hundred and sixty
pounds a year one hundred and twenty pounds a yearalso safeis two
eighty and two hundred and eighty pounds added to three hundred a year
means gilded luxury for a single woman Bess well go to the bank

Richer by two hundred and ten pounds stored in his moneybelt Dick
caused Bessie now thoroughly bewildered to hurry from the bank to the
P and O offices where he explained things tersely

Port Said single first cabin as close to the baggagehatch as
possible What ships going

The Colgong said the clerk

Shes a wet little hooker Is it Tilbury and a tender or Galleons and
the docks

Galleons Twelveforty Thursday

Thanks Change please I cant see very wellwill you count it into
my hand

If they all took their passages like that instead of talking about
their trunks life would be worth something said the clerk to his
neighbour who was trying to explain to a harassed mother of many that
condensed milk is just as good for babes at sea as daily dairy Being
nineteen and unmarried he spoke with conviction

We are now quoth Dick as they returned to the studio patting the
place where his moneybelt covered ticket and money beyond the reach
of man or devil or womanwhich is much more important Ive had three
little affairs to carry through before Thursday but I neednt ask you
to help Bess Come here on Thursday morning at nine Well breakfast
and you shall take me down to Galleons Station

What are you going to do

Going away of course What should I stay for

But you cant look after yourself

I can do anything I didnt realise it before but I can Ive done a
great deal already Resolution shall be treated to one kiss if Bessie
doesnt object Strangely enough Bessie objected and Dick laughed
I suppose youre right Well come at nine the day after tomorrow and
youll get your money

Shall I sure

I dont bilk and you wont know whether I do or not unless you come
Oh but its long and long to wait Goodbye Bessiesend Beeton here
as you go out

The housekeeper came

What are all the fittings of my rooms worth said Dick imperiously

Tisnt for me to say sir Some things is very pretty and some is wore
out dreadful

Im insured for two hundred and seventy

Insurance policies is no criterion though I dont say

Oh damn your longwindedness Youve made your pickings out of me and
the other tenants Why you talked of retiring and buying a publichouse
the other day Give a straight answer to a straight question

Fifty said Mr Beeton without a moments hesitation

Double it or Ill break up half my sticks and burn the rest

He felt his way to a bookstand that supported a pile of sketchbooks
and wrenched out one of the mahogany pillars

Thats sinful sir said the housekeeper alarmed

Its my own One hundred or

One hundred it is Itll cost me three and six to get that there
pilaster mended

I thought so What an out and out swindler you must have been to spring
that price at once

I hope Ive done nothing to dissatisfy any of the tenants least of all
you sir

Never mind that Get me the money tomorrow and see that all my clothes
are packed in the little brown bullocktrunk Im going

But the quarters notice

Ill pay forfeit Look after the packing and leave me alone

Mr Beeton discussed this new departure with his wife who decided that
Bessie was at the bottom of it all Her husband took a more charitable
view

Its very suddenbut then he was always sudden in his ways Listen to
him now

There was a sound of chanting from Dicks room

Well never come back any more boys Well never come back no more
Well go to the deuce on any excuse And never come back no more Oh say
were afloat or ashore boys Oh say were afloat or ashore But well
never come back any more boys Well never come back no more

Mr Beeton Mr Beeton Where the deuce is my pistol

Quick hes going to shoot himself avin gone mad said Mrs Beeton

Mr Beeton addressed Dick soothingly but it was some time before the
latter threshing up and down his bedroom could realise the intention
of the promises to find everything tomorrow sir

Oh you coppernosed old foolyou impotent Academician he shouted
at last Do you suppose I want to shoot myself Take the pistol in your
silly shaking hand then If you touch it it will go off because its
loaded Its among my campaignkit somewherein the parcel at the
bottom of the trunk

Long ago Dick had carefully possessed himself of a fortypound weight
fieldequipment constructed by the knowledge of his own experience It
was this putaway treasure that he was trying to find and rehandle Mr
Beeton whipped the revolver out of its place on the top of the package
and Dick drove his hand among the khaki coat and breeches the blue
cloth legbands and the heavy flannel shirts doubled over a pair of
swanneck spurs Under these and the waterbottle lay a sketchbook and
a pigskin case of stationery

These we dont want you can have them Mr Beeton Everything else
Ill keep Pack em on the top righthand side of my trunk When youve
done that come into the studio with your wife I want you both Wait a
minute get me a pen and a sheet of notepaper

It is not an easy thing to write when you cannot see and Dick had
particular reasons for wishing that his work should be clear So he
began following his right hand with his left The badness of this
writing is because I am blind and cannot see my pen Hmpheven a
lawyer cant mistake that It must be signed I suppose but it
neednt be witnessed Now an inch lowerwhy did I never learn to use
a typewriterThis is the last will and testament of me Richard
Heldar I am in sound bodily and mental health and there is no previous
will to revokeThats all right Damn the pen Whereabouts on the
paper was I I leave everything that I possess in the world including
four thousand pounds and two thousand seven hundred and twenty eight
pounds held for meoh I cant get this straight He tore off half
the sheet and began again with the caution about the handwriting
Then I leave all the money I possess in the world tohere followed
Maisies name and the names of the two banks that held the money

It maynt be quite regular but no one has a shadow of a right to
dispute it and Ive given Maisies address Come in Mr Beeton
This is my signature I want you and your wife to witness it Thanks
Tomorrow you must take me to the landlord and Ill pay forfeit for
leaving without notice and Ill lodge this paper with him in case
anything happens while Im away Now were going to light up the studio
stove Stay with me and give me my papers as I want em

No one knows until he has tried how fine a blaze a years accumulation
of bills letters and dockets can make Dick stuffed into the stove
every document in the studiosaving only three unopened letters
destroyed sketchbooks rough notebooks new and halffinished canvases
alike

What a lot of rubbish a tenant gets about him if he stays long enough
in one place to be sure said Mr Beeton at last

He does Is there anything more left Dick felt round the walls

Not a thing and the stoves nigh redhot

Excellent and youve lost about a thousand pounds worth of sketches
Ho ho Quite a thousand pounds worth if I can remember what I used to
be

Yes sir politely Mr Beeton was quite sure that Dick had gone mad
otherwise he would have never parted with his excellent furniture for a
song The canvas things took up storage room and were much better out of
the way

There remained only to leave the little will in safe hands that could
not be accomplished til tomorrow Dick groped about the floor picking
up the last pieces of paper assured himself again and again that there
remained no written word or sign of his past life in drawer or desk
and sat down before the stove till the fire died out and the contracting
iron cracked in the silence of the night



CHAPTER XV

 With a heart of furious fancies
 Whereof I am commander
 With a burning spear and a horse of air
 To the wilderness I wander

 With a knight of ghosts and shadows
 I summoned am to tourney
 Ten leagues beyond the wide worlds end
 Methinks it is no journey
 Tom o Bedlams Song

Goodbye Bess I promised you fifty Heres a hundredall that I got
for my furniture from Beeton That will keep you in pretty frocks for
some time Youve been a good little girl all things considered but
youve given me and Torpenhow a fair amount of trouble

Give Mr Torpenhow my love if you see him wont you

Of course I will dear Now take me up the gangplank and into the
cabin Once aboard the lugger and the maid isand I am free I mean

Wholl look after you on this ship

The headsteward if theres any use in money The doctor when we come
to Port Said if I know anything of P and O doctors After that the
Lord will provide as He used to do

Bess found Dick his cabin in the wild turmoil of a ship full of
leavetakers and weeping relatives Then he kissed her and laid himself
down in his bunk until the decks should be clear He who had taken so
long to move about his own darkened rooms well understood the geography
of a ship and the necessity of seeing to his own comforts was as wine
to him

Before the screw began to thrash the ship along the Docks he had been
introduced to the headsteward had royally tipped him secured a good
place at table opened out his baggage and settled himself down with
joy in the cabin It was scarcely necessary to feel his way as he moved
about for he knew everything so well Then God was very kind a deep
sleep of weariness came upon him just as he would have thought of
Maisie and he slept till the steamer had cleared the mouth of the
Thames and was lifting to the pulse of the Channel

The rattle of the engines the reek of oil and paint and a very
familiar sound in the next cabin roused him to his new inheritance

Oh its good to be alive again He yawned stretched himself
vigorously and went on deck to be told that they were almost abreast of
the lights of Brighton This is no more open water than Trafalgar Square
is a common the free levels begin at Ushant but none the less Dick
could feel the healing of the sea at work upon him already A boisterous
little crossswell swung the steamer disrespectfully by the nose and
one wave breaking far aft spattered the quarterdeck and the pile of new
deckchairs He heard the foam fall with the clash of broken glass was
stung in the face by a cupful and sniffing luxuriously felt his way to
the smokingroom by the wheel There a strong breeze found him blew
his cap off and left him bareheaded in the doorway and the smokingroom
steward understanding that he was a voyager of experience said that
the weather would be stiff in the chops off the Channel and more than
half a gale in the Bay These things fell as they were foretold and
Dick enjoyed himself to the utmost It is allowable and even necessary
at sea to lay firm hold upon tables stanchions and ropes in moving
from place to place On land the man who feels with his hands is
patently blind At sea even a blind man who is not seasick can jest
with the doctor over the weakness of his fellows Dick told the doctor
many talesand these are coin of more value than silver if properly
handledsmoked with him till unholy hours of the night and so won his
shortlived regard that he promised Dick a few hours of his time when
they came to Port Said

And the sea roared or was still as the winds blew and the engines sang
their song day and night and the sun grew stronger day by day and
Tom the Lascar barber shaved Dick of a morning under the opened
hatchgrating where the cool winds blew and the awnings were spread and
the passengers made merry and at last they came to Port Said

Take me said Dick to the doctor to Madame Binatsif you know
where that is

Whew said the doctor I do Theres not much to choose between em
but I suppose youre aware that thats one of the worst houses in the
place Theyll rob you to begin with and knife you later

Not they Take me there and I can look after myself

So he was brought to Madame Binats and filled his nostrils with the
wellremembered smell of the East that runs without a change from the
Canal head to HongKong and his mouth with the villainous Lingua Franca
of the Levant The heat smote him between the shoulderblades with
the buffet of an old friend his feet slipped on the sand and his
coatsleeve was warm as newbaked bread when he lifted it to his nose

Madame Binat smiled with the smile that knows no astonishment when Dick
entered the drinkingshop which was one source of her gains But for a
little accident of complete darkness he could hardly realise that he
had ever quitted the old life that hummed in his ears Somebody opened
a bottle of peculiarly strong Schiedam The smell reminded Dick of
Monsieur Binat who by the way had spoken of art and degradation

Binat was dead Madame said as much when the doctor departed
scandalised so far as a ships doctor can be at the warmth of Dicks
reception Dick was delighted at it They remember me here after a
year They have forgotten me across the water by this time Madame I
want a long talk with you when youre at liberty It is good to be back
again

In the evening she set an irontopped cafetable out on the sands and
Dick and she sat by it while the house behind them filled with riot
merriment oaths and threats The stars came out and the lights of the
shipping in the harbour twinkled by the head of the Canal

Yes The war is good for trade my friend but what dost thou do here
We have not forgotten thee

I was over there in England and I went blind

But there was the glory first We heard of it here even hereI
and Binat and thou hast used the head of Yellow Tinashe is still
aliveso often and so well that Tina laughed when the papers arrived
by the mailboats It was always something that we here could recognise
in the paintings And then there was always the glory and the money for
thee

I am not poorI shall pay you well

Not to me Thou hast paid for everything Under her breath Mon Dieu
to be blind and so young What horror

Dick could not see her face with the pity on it or his own with the
discoloured hair at the temples He did not feel the need of pity he
was too anxious to get to the front once more and explained his desire

And where The Canal is full of the English ships Sometimes they fire
as they used to do when the war was hereten years ago Beyond Cairo
there is fighting but how canst thou go there without a correspondents
passport And in the desert there is always fighting but that is
impossible also said she

I must go to Suakin He knew thanks to Alfs readings that Torpenhow
was at work with the column that was protecting the construction of the
SuakinBerber line P and O steamers do not touch at that port and
besides Madame Binat knew everybody whose help or advice was worth
anything They were not respectable folk but they could cause things to
be accomplished which is much more important when there is work toward

But at Suakin they are always fighting That desert breeds men
alwaysand always more men And they are so bold Why to Suakin

My friend is there

Thy friend Chtt Thy friend is death then

Madame Binat dropped a fat arm on the tabletop filled Dicks glass
anew and looked at him closely under the stars There was no need that
he should bow his head in assent and sayNo He is a man butif it
should arrive blamest thou

I blame she laughed shrilly Who am I that I should blame any
oneexcept those who try to cheat me over their consommations But it
is very terrible

I must go to Suakin Think for me A great deal has changed within the
year and the men I knew are not here The Egyptian lighthouse steamer
goes down the Canal to Suakinand the postboatsBut even then

Do not think any longer I know and it is for me to think Thou shalt
gothou shalt go and see thy friend Be wise Sit here until the house
is a little quietI must attend to my guestsand afterwards go to bed
Thou shalt go in truth thou shalt go

Tomorrow

As soon as may be She was talking as though he were a child

He sat at the table listening to the voices in the harbour and the
streets and wondering how soon the end would come till Madame Binat
carried him off to bed and ordered him to sleep The house shouted and
sang and danced and revelled Madame Binat moving through it with
one eye on the liquor payments and the girls and the other on Dicks
interests To this latter end she smiled upon scowling and furtive
Turkish officers of fellaheen regiments and was more than kind to camel
agents of no nationality whatever

In the early morning being then appropriately dressed in a flaming
red silk balldress with a front of tarnished gold embroidery and a
necklace of plateglass diamonds she made chocolate and carried it in
to Dick

It is only I and I am of discreet age eh Drink and eat the roll too
Thus in France mothers bring their sons when those behave wisely the
morning chocolate She sat down on the side of the bed whisperingIt
is all arranged Thou wilt go by the lighthouse boat That is a bribe
of ten pounds English The captain is never paid by the Government The
boat comes to Suakin in four days There will go with thee George a
Greek muleteer Another bribe of ten pounds I will pay they must not
know of thy money George will go with thee as far as he goes with his
mules Then he comes back to me for his wellbeloved is here and if
I do not receive a telegram from Suakin saying that thou art well the
girl answers for George

Thank you He reached out sleepily for the cup You are much too
kind Madame

If there were anything that I might do I would say stay here and be
wise but I do not think that would be best for thee She looked at her
liquorstained dress with a sad smile Nay thou shalt go in truth
thou shalt go It is best so My boy it is best so

She stooped and kissed Dick between the eyes That is for
goodmorning she said going away When thou art dressed we will
speak to George and make everything ready But first we must open the
little trunk Give me the keys

The amount of kissing lately has been simply scandalous I shall expect
Torp to kiss me next He is more likely to swear at me for getting in
his way though Well it wont last longOhe Madame help me to my
toilette of the guillotine There will be no chance of dressing properly
out yonder

He was rummaging among his new campaignkit and rowelling his hands
with the spurs There are two ways of wearing welloiled anklejacks
spotless blue bands khaki coat and breeches and a perfectly pipeclayed
helmet The right way is the way of the untired man master of himself
setting out upon an expedition well pleased

Everything must be very correct Dick explained It will become dirty
afterwards but now it is good to feel well dressed Is everything as it
should be

He patted the revolver neatly hidden under the fulness of the blouse on
the right hip and fingered his collar

I can do no more Madame said between laughing and crying Look at
thyselfbut I forgot

I am very content He stroked the creaseless spirals of his leggings

Now let us go and see the captain and George and the lighthouse boat
Be quick Madame

But thou canst not be seen by the harbour walking with me in the
daylight Figure to yourself if some English ladies

There are no English ladies and if there are I have forgotten them
Take me there

In spite of this burning impatience it was nearly evening ere the
lighthouse boat began to move Madame had said a great deal both to
George and the captain touching the arrangements that were to be made
for Dicks benefit Very few men who had the honour of her acquaintance
cared to disregard Madames advice That sort of contempt might end in
being knifed by a stranger in a gambling hell upon surprisingly short
provocation

For six daystwo of them were wasted in the crowded Canalthe
little steamer worked her way to Suakin where she was to pick up the
superintendent of the lighthouse and Dick made it his business to
propitiate George who was distracted with fears for the safety of his
lightoflove and half inclined to make Dick responsible for his own
discomfort When they arrived George took him under his wing and
together they entered the redhot seaport encumbered with the material
and wastage of the SuakinBerger line from locomotives in disconsolate
fragments to mounds of chairs and potsleepers

If you keep with me said George nobody will ask for passports or
what you do They are all very busy

Yes but I should like to hear some of the Englishmen talk They might
remember me I was known here a long time agowhen I was some one
indeed

A long time ago is a very long time ago here The graveyards are full
Now listen This new railway runs out so far as TanaielHassanthat is
seven miles Then there is a camp They say that beyond TanaielHassan
the English troops go forward and everything that they require will be
brought to them by this line

Ah Base camp I see Thats a better business than fighting Fuzzies in
the open

For this reason even the mules go up in the irontrain

Iron what

It is all covered with iron because it is still being shot at

An armoured train Better and better Go on faithful George

And I go up with my mules tonight Only those who particularly require
to go to the camp go out with the train They begin to shoot not far
from the city

The dearsthey always used to Dick snuffed the smell of parched
dust heated iron and flaking paint with delight Certainly the old
life was welcoming him back most generously

When I have got my mules together I go up tonight but you must first
send a telegram of Port Said declaring that I have done you no harm

Madame has you well in hand Would you stick a knife into me if you had
the chance

I have no chance said the Greek She is there with that woman

I see Its a bad thing to be divided between love of woman and the
chance of loot I sympathise with you George

They went to the telegraphoffice unquestioned for all the world was
desperately busy and had scarcely time to turn its head and Suakin was
the last place under sky that would be chosen for holidayground On
their return the voice of an English subaltern asked Dick what he was
doing The blue goggles were over his eyes and he walked with his hand
on Georges elbow as he repliedEgyptian Governmentmules My orders
are to give them over to the A C G at TanaielHassan Any occasion
to show my papers

Oh certainly not I beg your pardon Id no right to ask but not
seeing your face before I

I go out in the train tonight I suppose said Dick boldly There
will be no difficulty in loading up the mules will there

You can see the horseplatforms from here You must have them loaded up
early The young man went away wondering what sort of brokendown
waif this might be who talked like a gentleman and consorted with Greek
muleteers Dick felt unhappy To outface an English officer is no small
thing but the bluff loses relish when one plays it from the utter dark
and stumbles up and down rough ways thinking and eternally thinking
of what might have been if things had fallen out otherwise and all had
been as it was not

George shared his meal with Dick and went off to the mulelines His
charge sat alone in a shed with his face in his hands Before his
tightshut eyes danced the face of Maisie laughing with parted lips
There was a great bustle and clamour about him He grew afraid and
almost called for George

I say have you got your mules ready It was the voice of the
subaltern over his shoulder

My mans looking after them Thethe fact is Ive a touch of
ophthalmia and cant see very well

By Jove thats bad You ought to lie up in hospital for a while Ive
had a turn of it myself Its as bad as being blind

So I find it When does this armoured train go

At six oclock It takes an hour to cover the seven miles

Are the Fuzzies on the rampageeh

About three nights a week Fact is Im in acting command of the
nighttrain It generally runs back empty to Tanai for the night

Big camp at Tanai I suppose

Pretty big It has to feed our desertcolumn somehow

Is that far off

Between thirty and forty milesin an infernal thirsty country

Is the country quiet between Tanai and our men

More or less I shouldnt care to cross it alone or with a subalterns
command for the matter of that but the scouts get through it in some
extraordinary fashion

They always did

Have you been here before then

I was through most of the trouble when it first broke out

In the service and cashiered was the subalterns first thought so he
refrained from putting any questions

Theres your man coming up with the mules It seems rather queer

That I should be muleleading said Dick

I didnt mean to say so but it is Forgive meits beastly
impertinence I know but you speak like a man who has been at a public
school Theres no mistaking the tone

I am a public school man

I thought so I say I dont want to hurt your feelings but youre a
little down on your luck arent you I saw you sitting with your head
in your hands and thats why I spoke

Thanks I am about as thoroughly and completely broke as a man need
be

SupposeI mean Im a public school man myself Couldnt I
perhapstake it as a loan yknow and

Youre much too good but on my honour Ive as much money as I want
 I tell you what you could do for me though and put me under an
everlasting obligation Let me come into the bogie truck of the train
There is a foretruck isnt there

Yes How dyou know

Ive been in an armoured train before Only let me seehear some
of the fun I mean and Ill be grateful I go at my own risk as a
noncombatant

The young man thought for a minute All right he said Were
supposed to be an empty train and theres no one to blow me up at the
other end

George and a horde of yelling amateur assistants had loaded up the
mules and the narrowgauge armoured train plated with threeeighths
inch boilerplate till it looked like one long coffin stood ready to
start

Two bogie trucks running before the locomotive were completely covered
in with plating except that the leading one was pierced in front for
the muzzle of a machinegun and the second at either side for lateral
fire

The trucks together made one long ironvaulted chamber in which a score
of artillerymen were rioting

Whitechapellast train Ah I see yer kissin in the first class
there somebody shouted just as Dick was clamouring into the forward
truck

Lordy Eres a real live passenger for the Kew Tanai Acton and
Ealin train Echo sir Speshul edition Star sirShall I get you
a footwarmer said another

Thanks Ill pay my footing said Dick and relations of the most
amiable were established ere silence came with the arrival of the
subaltern and the train jolted out over the rough track

This is an immense improvement on shooting the unimpressionable Fuzzy
in the open said Dick from his place in the corner

Oh but hes still unimpressed There he goes said the subaltern as
a bullet struck the outside of the truck We always have at least
one demonstration against the nighttrain Generally they attack the
reartruck where my junior commands He gets all the fun of the fair

Not tonight though Listen said Dick A flight of heavyhanded
bullets was succeeded by yelling and shouts The children of the desert
valued their nightly amusement and the train was an excellent mark

Is it worth giving them half a hopper full the subaltern asked of the
engine which was driven by a Lieutenant of Sappers

I should think so This is my section of the line Theyll be playing
old Harry with my permanent way if we dont stop em

Right O

Hrrmph said the machine gun through all its five noses as the
subaltern drew the lever home The empty cartridges clashed on the floor
and the smoke blew back through the truck There was indiscriminate
firing at the rear of the train and return fire from the darkness
without and unlimited howling Dick stretched himself on the floor wild
with delight at the sounds and the smells

God is very goodI never thought Id hear this again Give em hell
men Oh give em hell he cried

The train stopped for some obstruction on the line ahead and a party
went out to reconnoitre but came back cursing for spades The
children of the desert had piled sand and gravel on the rails and
twenty minutes were lost in clearing it away Then the slow progress
recommenced to be varied with more shots more shoutings the steady
clack and kick of the machine guns and a final difficulty with a
halflifted rail ere the train came under the protection of the roaring
camp at TanaielHassan

Now you see why it takes an hour and a half to fetch her through
said the subaltern unshipping the cartridgehopper above his pet gun

It was a lark though I only wish it had lasted twice as long
How superb it must have looked from outside said Dick sighing
regretfully

It palls after the first few nights By the way when youve settled
about your mules come and see what we can find to eat in my tent Im
Bennil of the Gunnersin the artillery linesand mind you dont fall
over my tentropes in the dark

But it was all dark to Dick He could only smell the camels the
haybales the cooking the smoky fires and the tanned canvas of the
tents as he stood where he had dropped from the train shouting for
George There was a sound of lighthearted kicking on the iron skin of
the rear trucks with squealing and grunting George was unloading the
mules

The engine was blowing off steam nearly in Dicks ear a cold wind of
the desert danced between his legs he was hungry and felt tired and
dirtyso dirty that he tried to brush his coat with his hands That was
a hopeless job he thrust his hands into his pockets and began to count
over the many times that he had waited in strange or remote places for
trains or camels mules or horses to carry him to his business In
those days he could seefew men more clearlyand the spectacle of an
armed camp at dinner under the stare was an ever fresh pleasure to the
eye There was colour light and motion without which no man has much
pleasure in living This night there remained for him only one more
journey through the darkness that never lifts to tell a man how far he
has travelled Then he would grip Torpenhows hand againTorpenhow who
was alive and strong and lived in the midst of the action that had once
made the reputation of a man called Dick Heldar not in the least to be
confused with the blind bewildered vagabond who seemed to answer to
the same name Yes he would find Torpenhow and come as near to the old
life as might be Afterwards he would forget everything Bessie who had
wrecked the Melancolia and so nearly wrecked his life Beeton who lived
in a strange unreal city full of tintacks and gasplugs and matters
that no men needed that irrational being who had offered him love
and loyalty for nothing but had not signed her name and most of all
Maisie who from her own point of view was undeniably right in all she
did but oh at this distance so tantalisingly fair

Georges hand on his arm pulled him back to the situation

And what now said George

Oh yes of course What now Take me to the camelmen Take me to where
the scouts sit when they come in from the desert They sit by their
camels and the camels eat grain out of a black blanket held up at the
corners and the men eat by their side just like camels Take me there

The camp was rough and rutty and Dick stumbled many times over the
stumps of scrub The scouts were sitting by their beasts as Dick knew
they would The light of the dungfires flickered on their bearded
faces and the camels bubbled and mumbled beside them at rest It was no
part of Dicks policy to go into the desert with a convoy of
supplies That would lead to impertinent questions and since a blind
noncombatant is not needed at the front he would probably be forced to
return to Suakin

He must go up alone and go immediately

Now for one last bluffthe biggest of all he said Peace be with
you brethren The watchful George steered him to the circle of the
nearest fire The heads of the camelsheiks bowed gravely and the
camels scenting a European looked sideways curiously like brooding
hens half ready to get to their feet

A beast and a driver to go to the fighting line tonight said Dick

A Mulaid said a voice scornfully naming the best baggagebreed that
he knew

A Bisharin returned Dick with perfect gravity A Bisharin without
saddlegalls Therefore no charge of thine shockhead

Two or three minutes passed ThenWe be kneehaltered for the night
There is no going out from the camp

Not for money

Hm Ah English money

Another depressing interval of silence

How much

Twentyfive pounds English paid into the hand of the driver at my
journeys end and as much more into the hand of the camelsheik here
to be paid when the driver returns

This was royal payment and the sheik who knew that he would get his
commission on this deposit stirred in Dicks behalf

For scarcely one nights journeyfifty pounds Land and wells and
good trees and wives to make a man content for the rest of his days Who
speaks said Dick

I said a voice I will gobut there is no going from the camp

Fool I know that a camel can break his kneehalter and the sentries
do not fire if one goes in chase Twentyfive pounds and another
twentyfive pounds But the beast must be a good Bisharin I will take
no baggagecamel

Then the bargaining began and at the end of half an hour the first
deposit was paid over to the sheik who talked in low tones to the
driver

Dick heard the latter say A little way out only Any baggagebeast
will serve Am I a fool to waste my cattle for a blind man

And though I cannot seeDick lifted his voice a littleyet I carry
that which has six eyes and the driver will sit before me If we do not
reach the English troops in the dawn he will be dead

But where in Gods name are the troops

Unless thou knowest let another man ride Dost thou know Remember it
will be life or death to thee

I know said the driver sullenly Stand back from my beast I am
going to slip him

Not so swiftly George hold the camels head a moment I want to feel
his cheek The hands wandered over the hide till they found the
branded halfcircle that is the mark of the Biharin the lightbuilt
ridingcamel

That is well Cut this one loose Remember no blessing of God comes on
those who try to cheat the blind

The men chuckled by the fires at the cameldrivers discomfiture He had
intended to substitute a slow saddlegalled baggagecolt

Stand back one shouted lashing the Biharin under the belly with a
quirt Dick obeyed as soon as he felt the nosestring tighten in his
handand a cry went up Illaha Aho He is loose

With a roar and a grunt the Biharin rose to his feet and plunged forward
toward the desert his driver following with shouts and lamentation

George caught Dicks arm and hurried him stumbling and tripping past a
disgusted sentry who was used to stampeding camels

Whats the row now he cried

Every stitch of my kit on that blasted dromedary Dick answered after
the manner of a common soldier

Go on and take care your throats not cut outsideyou and your
dromedarys

The outcries ceased when the camel had disappeared behind a hillock and
his driver had called him back and made him kneel down

Mount first said Dick Then climbing into the second seat and gently
screwing the pistol muzzle into the small of his companions back Go
on in Gods name and swiftly Goodbye George Remember me to Madame
and have a good time with your girl Get forward child of the Pit

A few minutes later he was shut up in a great silence hardly broken by
the creaking of the saddle and the soft pad of the tireless feet Dick
adjusted himself comfortably to the rock and pitch of the pace girthed
his belt tighter and felt the darkness slide past For an hour he was
conscious only of the sense of rapid progress

A good camel he said at last

He was never underfed He is my own and clean bred the driver
replied

Go on

His head dropped on his chest and he tried to think but the tenor of
his thoughts was broken because he was very sleepy In the half doze in
seemed that he was learning a punishment hymn at Mrs Jennetts He had
committed some crime as bad as Sabbathbreaking and she had locked him
up in his bedroom But he could never repeat more than the first two
lines of the hymn

When Israel of the Lord believed Out of the land of bondage came

He said them over and over thousands of times The driver turned in the
saddle to see if there were any chance of capturing the revolver and
ending the ride Dick roused struck him over the head with the
butt and stormed himself wide awake Somebody hidden in a clump of
camelthorn shouted as the camel toiled up rising ground A shot was
fired and the silence shut down again bringing the desire to sleep
Dick could think no longer He was too tired and stiff and cramped to
do more than nod uneasily from time to time waking with a start and
punching the driver with the pistol

Is there a moon he asked drowsily

She is near her setting

I wish that I could see her Halt the camel At least let me hear the
desert talk

The man obeyed Out of the utter stillness came one breath of wind
It rattled the dead leaves of a shrub some distance away and ceased A
handful of dry earth detached itself from the edge of a rail trench and
crumbled softly to the bottom

Go on The night is very cold

Those who have watched till the morning know how the last hour before
the light lengthens itself into many eternities It seemed to Dick that
he had never since the beginning of original darkness done anything at
all save jolt through the air Once in a thousand years he would
finger the nailheads on the saddlefront and count them all carefully
Centuries later he would shift his revolver from his right hand to his
left and allow the eased arm to drop down at his side From the safe
distance of London he was watching himself thus employedwatching
critically Yet whenever he put out his hand to the canvas that he might
paint the tawny yellow desert under the glare of the sinking moon the
black shadow of a camel and the two bowed figures atop that hand held a
revolver and the arm was numbed from wrist to collarbone Moreover he
was in the dark and could see no canvas of any kind whatever

The driver grunted and Dick was conscious of a change in the air

I smell the dawn he whispered

It is here and yonder are the troops Have I done well

The camel stretched out its neck and roared as there came down wind the
pungent reek of camels in the square

Go on We must get there swiftly Go on

They are moving in their camp There is so much dust that I cannot see
what they do

Am I in better case Go forward

They could hear the hum of voices ahead the howling and the bubbling of
the beasts and the hoarse cries of the soldiers girthing up for the day

Two or three shots were fired

Is that at us Surely they can see that I am English Dick spoke
angrily

Nay it is from the desert the driver answered cowering in his
saddle

Go forward my child Well it is that the dawn did not uncover us an
hour ago

The camel headed straight for the column and the shots behind
multiplied The children of the desert had arranged that most
uncomfortable of surprises a dawn attack for the English troops and
were getting their distance by snapshots at the only moving object
without the square

What luck What stupendous and imperial luck said Dick Its just
before the battle mother Oh God has been most good to me Onlythe
agony of the thought made him screw up his eyes for an instantMaisie

Allahu We are in said the man as he drove into the rearguard and
the camel knelt

Who the deuce are you Despatches or what Whats the strength of the
enemy behind that ridge How did you get through asked a dozen voices
For all answer Dick took a long breath unbuckled his belt and shouted
from the saddle at the top of a wearied and dusty voice Torpenhow
Ohe Torp Cooee Torpenhow

A bearded man raking in the ashes of a fire for a light to his pipe
moved very swiftly towards that cry as the rearguard facing about
began to fire at the puffs of smoke from the hillocks around Gradually
the scattered white cloudlets drew out into the long lines of banked
white that hung heavily in the stillness of the dawn before they turned
over wavelike and glided into the valleys The soldiers in the square
were coughing and swearing as their own smoke obstructed their view and
they edged forward to get beyond it A wounded camel leaped to its feet
and roared aloud the cry ending in a bubbling grunt Some one had
cut its throat to prevent confusion Then came the thick sob of a
man receiving his deathwound from a bullet then a yell of agony and
redoubled firing

There was no time to ask any questions

Get down man Get down behind the camel

No Put me I pray in the forefront of the battle Dick turned his
face to Torpenhow and raised his hand to set his helmet straight but
miscalculating the distance knocked it off Torpenhow saw that his hair
was gray on the temples and that his face was the face of an old man

Come down you damned fool Dickie come off

And Dick came obediently but as a tree falls pitching sideways from
the Bisharins saddle at Torpenhows feet His luck had held to the
last even to the crowning mercy of a kindly bullet through his head

Torpenhow knelt under the lee of the camel with Dicks body in his
arms

VOLUME VII THE STORY OF THE GADSBYS




Preface

To THE ADDRESS OF

CAPTAIN J MAFFLIN

Duke of Derrys Pink Hussars

DEAR MAFFLINYou will remember that I wrote this story as an Awful
Warning None the less you have seen fit to disregard it and have
followed Gadsbys exampleas I betted you would I acknowledge that you
paid the money at once but you have prejudiced the mind of Mrs Mafflin
against myself for though I am almost the only respectable friend
of your bachelor days she has been darwaza band to me throughout the
season Further she caused you to invite me to dinner at the Club
where you called me a wild ass of the desert and went home
at halfpast ten after discoursing for twenty minutes on the
responsibilities of housekeeping You now drive a mailphaeton and sit
under a Church of England clergyman I am not angry Jack It is your
kismet as it was Gaddys and his kismet who can avoid Do not think
that I am moved by a spirit of revenge as I write thus publicly that
you and you alone are responsible for this book In other and more
expansive days when you could look at a magnum without flushing and
at a cheroot without turning white you supplied me with most of the
material Take it back againwould that I could have preserved your
fetterless speech in the tellingtake it back and by your slippered
hearth read it to the late Miss Deercourt She will not be any the more
willing to receive my cards but she will admire you immensely and you
I feel sure will love me You may even invite me to another very bad
dinnerat the Club which as you and your wife know is a safe
neutral ground for the entertainment of wild asses Then my very dear
hypocrite we shall be quits

Yours always

RUDYARD KIPLING

P SOn second thoughts I should recommend you to keep the book away
from Mrs Mafflin

Miss T Still looking out of the window Eh Oh I beg your pardon I
was thinking of something else

Capt G Aside Well I wonder what shell say next Ive never known
a woman treat me like this before I might bDash it I might be an
Infantry subaltern Aloud Oh please dont trouble Im not worth
thinking about Isnt your Mother ready yet

Miss T I should think so but promise me Captain Gamsby you wont
take poor dear Mamma twice round Jakko any more It tires her so

Capt G She says that no exercise tires her

Miss T Yes but she suffers afterward You dont know what rheumatism
is and you oughtnt to keep her out so late when it gets chill in the
evenings

Capt G Aside Rheumatism I thought she came off her horse rather
in a bunch Whew One lives and learns Aloud Im sorry to hear that
She hasnt mentioned it to me

Miss T Flurried Of course not Poor dear Mamma never would And
you mustnt say that I told you either Promise me that you wont Oh
Captain Gamsby promise me you wont

Capt G I am dumb orI shall be as soon as youve given me that
dance and anotherif you can trouble yourself to think about me for a
minute

Miss T But you wont like it one little bit Youll be awfully sorry
afterward

Capt G I shall like it above all things and I shall only be sorry
that I didnt get more Aside Now what in the world am I saying

Miss T Very well You will have only yourself to thank if your toes are
trodden on Shall we say Seven

Capt G And Eleven Aside She cant be more than eight stone but
even then its an absurdly small foot Looks at his own riding boots

Miss T Theyre beautifully shiny I can almost see my face in them

Capt G I was thinking whether I should have to go on crutches for the
rest of my life if you trod on my toes

Miss T Very likely Why not change Eleven for a square

Capt G No please I want them both waltzes Wont you write them
down

Miss T I dont get so many dances that I shall confuse them You will
be the offender

Capt G Wait and see Aside She doesnt dance perfectly perhaps
but

Miss T Your tea must have got cold by this time Wont you have another
cup

Capt G No thanks Dont you think its pleasanter out in the veranda
Aside I never saw hair take that color in the sunshine before
Aloud Its like one of Dicksees pictures

Miss T Yes I Its a wonderful sunset isnt it Bluntly But what do
you know about Dicksees pictures

Capt G I go Home occasionally And I used to know the Galleries
Nervously You mustnt think me only a Philistine with a moustache

Miss T Dont Please dont Im so sorry for what I said then I was
horribly rude It slipped out before j thought Dont you know the
temptation to say frightful and shocking things just for the mere sake
of saying them Im afraid I gave way to it

Capt G Watching the girl as she flushes I think I know the feeling
It would be terrible if we all yielded to it wouldnt it For instance
I might say

POOR DEAR MAMMA Entering habited hatted and booted Ah Captain
Gamsby Sorry to keep you waiting Hope you havent been bored My
little girl been talking to you

Miss T Aside Im not sorry I spoke about the rheumatism Im not
Im NOT I only wished Id mentioned the corns too

Capt G Aside What a shame I wonder how old she is It never
occurred to me before Aloud Weve been discussing Shakespeare and
the musical glasses in the veranda

Miss T Aside Nice man He knows that quotation He isnt a
Philistine with a moustache Aloud Goodbye Captain Gadsby Aside
What a huge hand and what a squeeze I dont suppose he meant it but he
has driven the rings into my fingers

Poor Dear Mamma Has Vermillion come round yet Oh yes Captain Gadsby
dont you think that the saddle is too far forward They pass into the
front veranda

Capt G Aside How the dickens should I know what she prefers She
told me that she doted on horses Aloud I think it is

Miss T Coming out into front veranda Oh Bad Buldoo I must speak to
him for this He has taken up the curb two links and Vermillion bates
that Passes out and to horses head

Capt G Let me do it

Miss T No Vermillion understands me Dont you old man Loosens
curbchain skilfully and pats horse on nose and throttle Poor
Vermillion Did they want to cut his chin off There

Captain Gadsby watches the interlude with undisguised admiration

Poor Dear Mamma Tartly to Miss T Youve forgotten your guest I
think dear

Miss T Good gracious So I have Goodbye Retreats indoors hastily

Poor Dear Mamma Bunching reins in fingers hampered by too tight
gauntlets CAPTAIN Gadsby

CAPTAIN GADSBY stoops and makes the footrest Poor Dear Mamma blunders
halts too long and breaks through it

Capt G Aside Cant hold up seven stone forever Its all your
rheumatism Aloud Cant imagine why I was so clumsy Aside Now
Little Featherweight would have gone up like a bird

They ride out of the garden The Captain falls back

Capt G Aside How that habit catches her under the arms Ugh

Poor Dear Mamma With the worn smile of sixteen seasons the worse for
exchange Youre dull this afternoon Captain Gadsby

Capt G Spurring up wearily Why did you keep me waiting so long

room Is this all of you tonight

DOONE PWD Anthony was called out at dinner Mingle had a pain in
his tummy

Curtiss Miggy dies of cholera once a week in the Rains and gets drunk

Simladisgustingly fit

Curtiss Good Lord how truly magnificent Was there enough ice When I
mangled garbage there I got one whole lumpnearly as big as a walnut
What had Markyn to say for himself

Blayne Seems that every one is having a fairly good time up there in
spite of the rain By Jove that reminds me I know I hadntcome across
just for the pleasure of your society News Great news Markyn told me

DOONE Whos dead now

Blayne No one that I know of but Gadsbys hooked at last

DROPPING CHORUS How much The Devil Markyn was pulling your leg Not

MACKESY BarristeratLaw Huh Women will give out anything What

Curtiss Stars perhaps Caddy knows that brand

Blayne ThreeganMinnie Threegan

Mackesy Threegan Isnt she a little bit of a girl with red hair

Blayne Bout thatfrom what from what Markyn said

Mackesy Then Ive met her She was at Lucknow last season Owned a
permanently juvenile Mamma and danced damnably I say Jervoise you
knew the Threegans didnt you

JERVOISE Civilian of twentyfive years service waking up from his
doze Eh Whats that Knew who How I thought I was at Home confound
you

Mackesy The Threegan girls engaged so Blayne says

Jervoise Slowly Engagedengaged Bless my soul Im getting an old
man Little Minnie Threegan engaged It was only the other day I went
home with them in the Suratno the Massiliaand she was crawling
about on her hands and knees among the ayahs Used to call me the
Tick Tack Sahib because I showed her my watch And that was in
SixtySevenno Seventy Good God how time flies Im an old man
I remember when Threegan married Miss Derwentdaughter of old Hooky
Derwentbut that was before your time And so the little babys engaged
to have a little baby of her own Whos the other fool

Mackesy Gadsby of the Pink Hussars

Jervoise Never met him Threegan lived in debt married in debt
andll die in debt Must be glad to get the girl off his hands

Blayne Caddy has moneylucky devil Place at Home too

Doone He comes of firstclass stock Cant quite understand his being
caught by a Colonels daughter and looking cautiously round room
Black Infantry at that No offence to you Blayne

Blayne Stiffly Not much thaanks

Curtiss Quoting motto of Irregular Moguls We are what we are eh
old man But Gadsby was such a superior animal as a rule Why didnt he
go Home and pick his wife there

Mackesy They are all alike when they come to the turn into the
straight About thirty a man begins to get sick of living alone

Curtiss And of the eternal muttonchop in the morning

Doone Its a dead goat as a rule but go on Mackesy

Mackesy If a mans once taken that way nothing will hold him Do you
remember Benoit of your service Doone They transferred him to Tharanda
when his time came and he married a platelayers daughter or something
of that kind She was the only female about the place

Doone Yes poor brute That smashed Benoits chances of promotion
altogether Mrs Benoit used to ask Was you goin to the dance this
evenin

Curtiss Hang it all Gadsby hasnt married beneath him Theres no
tarbrush in the family I suppose

Jervoise Tarbrush Not an anna You young fellows talk as though
the man was doing the girl an honor in marrying her Youre all too
conceitednothings good enough for you

Blayne Not even an empty Club a dam bad dinner at the Judges and
a Station as sickly as a hospital Youre quite right Were a set of
Sybarites

Doone Luxurious dogs wallowing in

Curtiss Prickly heat between the shoulders Im covered with it Lets
hope Beora will be cooler

Blayne Whew Are you ordered into camp too I thought the Gunners had
a clean sheet

Curtiss No worse luck Two cases yesterdayone diedand if we have a
third out we go Is there any shooting at Beora Doone

Doone The countrys under water except the patch by the Grand Trunk
Road I was there yesterday looking at a bund and came across four
poor devils in their last stage Its rather bad from here to Kuchara

Curtiss Then were pretty certain to have a heavy go of it Heigho
I shouldnt mind changing places with Gaddy for a while Sport with
Amaryllis in the shade of the Town Hall and all that Oh why doesnt
somebody come and marry me instead of letting me go into choleracamp

Mackesy Ask the Committee

Curtiss You ruffian Youll stand me another peg for that Blayne
what will you take Mackesy is fine on moral grounds Done have you any
preference

Doone Small glass Kummel please Excellent carminative these days
Anthony told me so

Mackesy Signing voucher for four drinks Most unfair punishment
I only thought of Curtiss as Actaeon being chivied round the billiard
tables by the nymphs of Diana

Blayne Curtiss would have to import his nymphs by train Mrs Cockleys
the only woman in the Station She wont leave Cockley and hes doing
his best to get her to go

Curtiss Good indeed Heres Mrs Cockleys health To the only wife in
the Station and a damned brave woman

OMNES Drinking A damned brave woman

Blayne I suppose Gadsby will bring his wife here at the end of the cold
weather They are going to be married almost immediately I believe

Curtiss Gadsby may thank his luck that the Pink Hussars are all
detachment and no headquarters this hot weather or hed be torn
from the arms of his love as sure as death Have you ever noticed the
thoroughminded way British Cavalry take to cholera Its because they
are so expensive If the Pinks had stood fast here they would have been
out in camp a month ago Yes I should decidedly like to be Gadsby

Mackesy Hell go Home after hes married and send in his paperssee
if he doesnt

Blayne Why shouldnt he Hasnt he money Would any one of us be here
if we werent paupers

Doone Poor old pauper What has become of the six hundred you rooked
from our table last month

Blayne It took unto itself wings I think an enterprising tradesman got
some of it and a shroff gobbled the restor else I spent it

Curtiss Gadsby never had dealings with a shroff in his life

Doone Virtuous Gadsby If I had three thousand a month paid from
England I dont think Id deal with a shroff either

Mackesy Yawning Oh its a sweet life I wonder whether matrimony
would make it sweeter

Curtiss Ask Cockleywith his wife dying by inches

Blayne Go home and get a fool of a girl to come out towhat is it
Thackeray saysthe splendid palace of an Indian proconsul

Doone Which reminds me My quarters leak like a sieve I had fever last
night from sleeping in a swamp And the worst of it is one cant do
anything to a roof till the Rains are over

Curtiss Whats wrong with you You havent eighty rotting Tommies to
take into a running stream

Doone No but Im mixed boils and bad language Im a regular Job all
over my body Its sheer poverty of blood and I dont see any chance of
getting richereither way

Blayne Cant you take leave

Doone Thats the pull you Army men have over us Ten days are nothing
in your sight Im so important that Government cant find a substitute
if I go away Yees Id like to be Gadsby whoever his wife may be

Curtiss Youve passed the turn of life that Mackesy was speaking of

Doone Indeed I have but I never yet had the brutality to ask a woman
to share my life out here

Blayne On my soul I believe youre right Im thinking of Mrs Cockley
The womans an absolute wreck

Doone Exactly Because she stays down here The only way to keep her
fit would be to send her to the Hills for eight monthsand the same
with any woman I fancy I see myself taking a wife on those terms

Mackesy With the rupee at one and sixpence The little Doones would be
little Debra Doones with a fine Mussoorie chichi anent to bring home
for the holidays

Curtiss And a pair of beewtiful sambhurhorns for Doone to wear free
of expense presented byDoone Yes its an enchanting prospect By
the way the rupee hasnt done falling yet The time will come when we
shall think ourselves lucky if we only lose half our pay

Curtiss Surely a thirds loss enough Who gains by the arrangement
Thats what I want to know

Blayne The Silver Question Im going to bed if you begin squabbling
Thank Goodness heres Anthonylooking like a ghost

Enter ANTHONY Indian Medical Staff very white and tired

Anthony Evening Blayne Its raining in sheets Whiskey peg lao
khitmatgar The roads are something ghastly

Curtiss Hows Mingle

Anthony Very bad and more frightened I handed him over to Fewton
Mingle might just as well have called him in the first place instead of
bothering me

Blayne Hes a nervous little chap What has he got this time

Anthony Cant quite say A very bad tummy and a blue funk so far He
asked me at once if it was cholera and I told him not to be a fool
That soothed him

Curtiss Poor devil The funk does half the business in a man of that
build

Anthony Lighting a cheroot I firmly believe the funk will kill him
if he stays down You know the amount of trouble hes been giving Fewton
for the last three weeks Hes doing his very best to frighten himself
into the grave

GENERAL CHORUS Poor little devil Why doesnt he get away

Anthony Cant He has his leave all right but hes so dipped he cant
take it and I dont think his name on paper would raise four annas
Thats in confidence though

Mackesy All the Station knows it

Anthony I suppose I shall have to die here he said squirming all
across the bed Hes quite made up his mind to Kingdom Come And I know
he has nothing more than a wetweather tummy if he could only keep a
hand on himself

Blayne Thats bad Thats very bad Poor little Miggy Good little
chap too I say

Anthony What do you say

Blayne Well look hereanyhow If its like thatas you sayI say
fifty

Curtiss I say fifty

Mackesy I go twenty better

Doone Bloated Croesus of the Bar I say fifty Jervoise what do you
say Hi Wake up

Jervoise Eh Whats that Whats that

Curtiss We want a hundred rupees from you Youre a bachelor drawing a
gigantic income and theres a man in a hole

Jervoise What man Any one dead

Blayne No but hell die if you dontgive the hundred Here Heres
a pegvoucher You can see what weve signed for and Anthonys man will
come round tomorrow to collect it So there will be no trouble

Jervoise Signing One hundred E M J There you are feebly It
isnt one of your jokes is it

Blayne No it really is wanted Anthony you were the biggest
pokerwinner last week and youve defrauded the taxcollector too long
Sign

Anthony Lets see Three fifties and a seventytwo twentythree
twentysay four hundred and twenty Thatll give him a month clear at
the Hills Many thanks you men Ill send round the chaprassi tomorrow

Curtiss You must engineer his taking the stuff and of course you
mustnt

Anthony Of course It would never do Hed weep with gratitude over his
evening drink

Blayne Thats just what he would do damn him Oh I say Anthony you
pretend to know everything Have you heard about Gadsby

Anthony No Divorce Court at last

Blayne Worse Hes engaged

Anthony How much He cant be

Blayne He is Hes going to be married in a few weeks Markyn told me
at the Judges this evening Its pukka

Anthony You dont say so Holy Moses Therell be a shine in the tents
of Kedar

Curtiss Regiment cut up rough think you

Anthony Dont know anything about the Regiment

Mackesy It is bigamy then

Anthony Maybe Do you mean to say that you men have forgotten or is
there more charity in the world than I thought

Doone You dont look pretty when you are trying to keep a secret You
bloat Explain

Anthony Mrs Herriott

Blayne After a long pause to the room generally Its my notion that
we are a set of fools

Mackesy Nonsense That business was knocked on the head last season
Why young Mallard

Anthony Mallard was a candlestick paraded as such Think awhile
Recollect last season and the talk then Mallard or no Mallard did
Gadsby ever talk to any other woman

Curtiss Theres something in that It was slightly noticeable now you
come to mention it But shes at Naini Tal and hes at Simla

Anthony He had to go to Simla to look after a globetrotter relative of
hisa person with a title Uncle or aunt

Blayne And there he got engaged No law prevents a man growing tired of
a woman

Anthony Except that he mustnt do it till the woman is tired of him
And the Herriott woman was not that

Curtiss She may be now Two months of Naini Tal works wonders

Doone Curious thing how some women carry a Fate with them There was a
Mrs Deegie in the Central Provinces whose men invariably fell away and
got married It became a regular proverb with us when I was down there
I remember three men desperately devoted to her and they all one after
another took wives

Curtiss Thats odd Now I should have thought that Mrs Deegies
influence would have led them to take other mens wives It ought to
have made them afraid of the judgment of Providence

Anthony Mrs Herriott will make Gadsby afraid of something more than
the judgment of Providence I fancy

Blayne Supposing things are as you say hell be a fool to face her
Hell sit tight at Simla

Anthony Shouldnt be a bit surprised if he went off to Naini to
explain Hes an unaccountable sort of man and shes likely to be a
more than unaccountable woman

Doone What makes you take her character away so confidently

Anthony Primum tempus Caddy was her first and a woman doesnt allow
her first man to drop away without expostulation She justifies the
first transfer of affection to herself by swearing that it is forever
and ever Consequently

Blayne Consequently we are sitting here till past one oclock talking
scandal like a set of Station cats Anthony its all your fault We
were perfectly respectable till you came in Go to bed Im off Good
night all

Curtiss Past one Its past two by Jove and heres the khit coming for
the late charge Just Heavens One two three four five rupees to
pay for the pleasure of saying that a poor little beast of a woman is
no better than she should be Im ashamed of myself Go to bed you
slanderous villains and if Im sent to Beora tomorrow be prepared to
hear Im dead before paying my card account




THE TENTS OF KEDAR

 Only why should it be with pain at all
 Why must I twixt the leaves of coronal
 Put any kiss of pardon on thy brow
 Why should the other women know so much
 And talk together
 Such the look and such
 The smile he used to love with then as now

 Any Wife to any Husband

SCENE A Naini Tal dinner for thirtyfour Plate wines crockery and
khitmatgars carefully calculated to scale of Rs 6000 per mensem less
Exchange Table split lengthways by bank of flowers

MRS HERRIOTT After conversation has risen to proper pitch Ah
Didnt see you in the crush in the drawingroom Sotto voce Where
have you been all this while Pip

CAPTAIN GADSBY Turning from regularly ordained dinner partner and
settling hock glasses Good evening Sotto voce Not quite so loud
another time Youve no notion how your voice carries Aside So much
for shirking the written explanation Itll have to be a verbal one now
Sweet prospect How on earth am I to tell her that I am a respectable
engaged member of society and its all over between us

MRS H Ive a heavy score against you Where were you at the Monday
Pop Where were you on Tuesday Where were you at the Lamonts tennis I
was looking everywhere

Capt G For me Oh I was alive somewhere I suppose Aside Its for
Minnies sake but its going to be dashed unpleasant

Mrs H Have I done anything to offend you I never meant it if I have
I couldnt help going for a ride with the Vaynor man It was promised a
week before you came up

Capt G I didnt know

Mrs H It really was

Capt G Anything about it I mean

Mrs H What has upset you today All these days You havent been near
me for four whole daysnearly one hundred hours Was it kind of you
Pip And Ive been looking forward so much to your coming

Capt G Have you

Mrs H You know I have Ive been as foolish as a schoolgirl about it
I made a little calendar and put it in my cardcase and every time the
twelve oclock gun went off I scratched out a square and said That
brings me nearer to Pip My Pip

Capt G With an uneasy laugh What will Mackler think if you neglect
him so

Mrs H And it hasnt brought you nearer You seem farther away than
ever Are you sulking about something I know your temper

Capt G No

Mrs H Have I grown old in the last few months then Reaches forward
to bank of flowers for menucard

PARTNER ON LEFT Allow me Hands menucard Mrs H keeps her arm at
full stretch for three seconds

Mrs H To partner Oh thanks I didnt see Turns right again Is
anything in me changed at all

Capt G For Goodnesss sake go on with your dinner You must eat
something Try one of those cutlet arrangements Aside And I fancied
she had good shoulders once upon a time What an ass a man can make of
himself

Mrs H Helping herself to a paper frill seven peas some stamped
carrots and a spoonful of gravy That isnt an answer Tell me whether
I have done anything

Capt G Aside If it isnt ended here there will be a ghastly scene
somewhere else If only Id written to her and stood the racket at long
range To Khitmatgar Han Simpkin do Aloud Ill tell you later
on

Mrs H Tell me now It must be some foolish misunderstanding and you
know that there was to be nothing of that sort between us We of all
people in the world cant afford it Is it the Vaynor man and dont
you like to say so On my honor

Capt G I havent given the Vaynor man a thought

Mrs H But how dyou know that I havent

Capt G Aside Heres my chance and may the Devil help me through
with it Aloud and measuredly Believe me I do not care how often or
how tenderly you think of the Vaynor man

Mrs H I wonder if you mean that Oh what is the good of squabbling
and pretending to misunderstand when you are only up for so short a
time Pip dont be a stupid

Follows a pause during which he crosses his left leg over his right and
continues his dinner

Capt G In answer to the thunderstorm in her eyes Cornsmy worst

Mrs H Upon my word you are the very rudest man in the world Ill
never do it again

Capt G Aside No I dont think you will but I wonder what you will
do before its all over To Khitmatgar Thorah ur Simpkin do

Mrs H Well Havent you the grace to apologize bad man

Capt G Aside I mustnt let it drift back now Trust a woman for
being as blind as a bat when she wont see

Mrs H Im waiting or would you like me to dictate a form of apology

Capt G Desperately By all means dictate

Mrs H Lightly Very well Rehearse your several Christian names
after me and go on Profess my sincere repentance

Capt G Sincere repentance

Mrs H For having behaved

Capt G Aside At last I wish to Goodness shed look away For
having behavedas I have behaved and declare that I am thoroughly and
heartily sick of the whole business and take this opportunity of
making clear my intention of ending it now henceforward and forever
Aside If any one had told me I should be such a blackguard

Mrs H Shaking a spoonful of potato chips into her plate Thats not
a pretty joke

Capt G No Its a reality Aside I wonder if smashes of this kind
are always so raw

Mrs H Really Pip youre getting more absurd every day

Capt G I dont think you quite understand me Shall I repeat it

Mrs H No For pitys sake dont do that Its too terrible even in
fur

Capt G Ill let her think it over for a while But I ought to be
horsewhipped

Mrs H I want to know what you meant by what you said just now

Capt G Exactly what I said No less

Mrs H But what have I done to deserve it What have I done

Capt G Aside If she only wouldnt look at me Aloud and very
slowly his eyes on his plate Dyou remember that evening in July
before the Rains broke when you said that the end would have to come
sooner or laterand you wondered for which of US it would come first

Mrs H Yes I was only joking And you swore that as long as there was
breath in your body it should never come And I believed you

Capt G Fingering menucard Well it has Thats all

A long pause during which Mrs H bows her head and rolls the
breadtwist into little pellets G stares at the oleanders

Mrs H Throwing back her head and laughing naturally They train us
women well dont they Pip

Capt G Brutally touching shirtstud So far as the expression goes
Aside It isnt in her nature to take things quietly Therell be an
explosion yet

Mrs H With a shudder Thank you Bbut even Red Indians allow people
to wriggle when theyre being tortured I believe Slips fan from
girdle and fans slowly rim of fan level with chin

PARTNER ON LEFT Very close tonight isnt it You find it too much for
you

Mrs H Oh no not in the least But they really ought to have punkahs
even in your cool Naini Tal oughtnt they Turns dropping fan and
raising eyebrows

Capt G Its all right Aside Here comes the storm

Mrs H Her eyes on the tablecloth fan ready in right hand It was
very cleverly managed Pip and I congratulate you You sworeyou never
contented yourself with merely Saying a thingyou swore that as far
as lay in your power youd make my wretched life pleasant for me And
youve denied me the consolation of breaking down I should have
done itindeed I should A woman would hardly have thought of this
refinement my kind considerate friend Fanguard as before You have
explained things so tenderly and truthfully too You havent spoken or
written a word of warning and you have let me believe in you till the
last minute You havent condescended to give me your reason yet No
A woman could not have managed it half so well Are there many men like
you in the world

Capt G Im sure I dont know To Khitmatgar Ohe Simpkin do

Mrs H You call yourself a man of the world dont you Do men of the
world behave like Devils when they do a woman the honor to get tired of
her

Capt G Im sure I dont know Dont speak so loud

Mrs H Keep us respectable O Lord whatever happens Dont be afraid
of my compromising you Youve chosen your ground far too well and Ive
been properly brought up Lowering fan Havent you any pity Pip
except for yourself

Capt G Wouldnt it be rather impertinent of me to say that Im sorry
for you

Mrs H I think you have said it once or twice before Youre growing
very careful of my feelings My God Pip I was a good woman once You
said I was Youve made me what I am What are you going to do with
me What are you going to do with me Wont you say that you are sorry
Helps herself to iced asparagus

Capt G I am sorry for you if you WANT the pity of such a brute as I
am Im awfly sorry for you

Mrs H Rather tame for a man of the world Do you think that that
admission clears you

Capt G What can I do I can only tell you what I think of myself You
cant think worse than that

Mrs H Oh yes I can And now will you tell me the reason of all
this Remorse Has Bayard been suddenly consciencestricken

Capt G Angrily his eyes still lowered No The thing has come to an
end on my side Thats all Mafisch

Mrs H Thats all Mafisch As though I were a Cairene Dragoman You
used to make prettier speeches Dyou remember when you said

Capt G For Heavens sake dont bring that back Call me anything you
like and Ill admit it

Mrs H But you dont care to be reminded of old lies If I could
hope to hurt you onetenth as much as you have hurt me tonightNo I
wouldntI couldnt do itliar though you are

Capt G Ive spoken the truth

Mrs H My dear Sir you flatter yourself You have lied over the
reason Pip remember that I know you as you dont know yourself You
have been everything to me though you areFanguard Oh what a
contemptible Thing it is And so you are merely tired of me

Capt G Since you insist upon my repeating itYes

Mrs H Lie the first I wish I knew a coarser word Lie seems so
ineffectual in your case The fire has just died out and there is no
fresh one Think for a minute Pip if you care whether I despise you
more than I do Simply Mafisch is it

Capt G Yes Aside I think I deserve this

Mrs H Lie number two Before the next glass chokes you tell me her
name

Capt G Aside Ill make her pay for dragging Minnie into the
business Aloud Is it likely

Mrs H Very likely if you thought that it would flatter your vanity
Youd cry my name on the housetops to make people turn round

Capt G I wish I had There would have been an end to this business

Mrs H Oh no there would notAnd so you were going to be virtuous
and blase were you To come to me and say Ive done with you The
incident is cloosed I ought to be proud of having kept such a man so
long

Capt G Aside It only remains to pray for the end of the dinner

an earthquake

Mrs H She cant Is there anything that I wouldnt do for youor

of charity on your part

Mrs H Ahhh But I have no right to resent itIs she betterlooking
than I Who was it said

Capt G Nonot that

Mrs H Ill be more merciful than you were Dont you know that all
women are alike

Capt G Aside Then this is the exception that proves the rule

Mrs H All of them Ill tell you anything you like I will upon
my word They only want the admirationfrom anybodyno matter
whoanybody But there is always one man that they care for more than
any one else in the world and would sacrifice all the others to Oh do
listen Ive kept the Vaynor man trotting after me like a poodle and he
believes that he is the only man I am interested in Ill tell you what
he said to me

Capt G Spare him Aside I wonder what his version is

Mrs H Hes been waiting for me to look at him all through dinner
Shall I do it and you can see what an idiot he looks

Capt G But what imports the nomination of this gentleman

Mrs H Watch Sends a glance to the Vaynor man who tries vainly to
combine a mouthful of ice pudding a smirk of selfsatisfaction a glare
of intense devotion and the stolidity of a British dining countenance

Capt G Critically He doesnt look pretty Why didnt you wait till
the spoon was out of his mouth

Mrs H To amuse you Shell make an exhibition of you as Ive made of
him and people will laugh at you Oh Pip cant you see that Its
as plain as the noonday Sun Youll be trotted about and told lies and
made a fool of like the others I never made a fool of you did I

Capt G Aside What a clever little woman it is

Mrs H Well what have you to say

Capt G I feel better

Mrs H Yes I suppose so after I have come down to your level I
couldnt have done it if I hadnt cared for you so much I have spoken
the truth

Capt G It doesnt alter the situation

Mrs H Passionately Then she has said that she cares for you Dont
believe her Pip Its a lieas bad as yours to me

Capt G Ssssteady Ive a notion that a friend of yours is looking at
you

Mrs H He I hate him He introduced you to me

Capt G Aside And some people would like women to assist in making
the laws Introduction to imply condonement Aloud Well you see if
you can remember so far back as that I couldnt in common politeness
refuse the offer

Mrs H In common politeness IWe have got beyond that

Capt G Aside Old ground means fresh trouble Aloud On my honor

Mrs H Your what Ha ha

Capt G Dishonor then Shes not what you imagine I meant to

Mrs H Dont tell me anything about her She wont care for you and
when you come back after having made an exhibition of yourself youll
find me occupied with

doesnt bring her pride to her rescue nothing will

Mrs H Drawing herself up Couldnt do it ISoftening Youre
right I dont believe I couldthough you are what you area coward
and a liar in grain

Capt G It doesnt hurt so much after your little lecturewith
demonstrations

Mrs H One mass of vanity Will nothing ever touch you in this life
There must be a Hereafter if its only for the benefit ofBut you will
have it all to yourself

Capt G Under his eyebrows Are you certain of that

Mrs H I shall have had mine in this life and it will serve me right

Capt G But the admiration that you insisted on so strongly a moment
ago Aside Oh I am a brute

Mrs H Fiercely Will that console me for knowing that you will go to
her with the same words the same arguments and thethe same pet names
you used to me And if she cares for you you two will laugh over my
story Wont that be punishment heavy enough even for meeven for
meAnd its all useless Thats another punishment

Capt G Feebly Oh come Im not so low as you think

Mrs H Not now perhaps but you will be Oh Pip if a woman flatters
your vanity theres nothing on earth that you would not tell her and
no meanness that you would not do Have I known you so long without
knowing that

Capt G If you can trust me in nothing elseand I dont see why I
should be trustedyou can count upon my holding my tongue

Mrs H If you denied everything youve said this evening and declared
it was all in fun a long pause Id trust you Not otherwise All
I ask is dont tell her my name Please dont A man might forget a
woman never would Looks up table and sees hostess beginning to collect
eyes So its all ended through no fault of mineHavent I behaved
beautifully Ive accepted your dismissal and you managed it as cruelly
as you could and I have made you respect my sex havent I Arranging
gloves and fan I only pray that shell know you some day as I know you
now I wouldnt be you then for I think even your conceit will be
hurt I hope shell pay you back the humiliation youve brought on me
I hopeNo I dont I cant give you up I must have something to look
forward to or I shall go crazy When its all over come back to me
come back to me and youll find that youre my Pip still

Capt G Very clearly False move and you pay for it Its a girl

Mrs H Rising Then it was true They saidbut I wouldnt insult you
by asking A girl I was a girl not very long ago Be good to her Pip
I daresay she believes in you

Goes out with an uncertain smile He watches her through the door and
settles into a chair as the men redistribute themselves

Capt G Now if there is any Power who looks after this world will He
kindly tell me what I have done Reaching out for the claret and half
aloud What have I done

Mrs G Folding her hands If it pleases my Lord the King to issue

what we dont say that helps And its all the profoundest philosophy
But no one would understandeven if it were put into a book

Mrs G The idea Noonly we ourselves or people like ourselvesif
there are any people like us

Capt G Magisterially All people not like ourselves are blind
idiots

Mrs G Wiping her eyes Do you think then that there are any people
as happy as we are

Capt G Must beunless weve appropriated all the happiness in the
world

Mrs G Looking toward Simla Poor dears Just fancy if we have

Capt G Then well hang on to the whole show for its a great deal too
jolly to loseeh wife o mine

Mrs G O Pip Pip How much of you is a solemn married man and how
much a horrid slangy schoolboy

Capt G When you tell me how much of you was eighteen last birthday and
how much is as old as the Sphinx and twice as mysterious perhaps Ill
attend to you Lend me that banjo The spirit moveth me to yowl at the
sunset

Mrs G Mind Its not tuned Ah How that jars

Capt G Turning pegs Its amazingly different to keep a banjo to
proper pitch

Mrs G Its the same with all musical instruments What shall it be

Capt G Vanity and let the hills hear Sings through the first and
half of the second verse Turning to Mrs G Now chorus Sing Pussy

BOTH TOGETHER Con brio to the horror of the monkeys who are settling
for the night

Vanity all is Vanity said Wisdom scorning meI clasped my true
Loves tender hand and answered frank and freeee If this be Vanity
whod be wise If this be Vanity whod be wise If this be Vanity whod
be wiise Crescendo Vanity let it be

Mrs G Defiantly to the grey of the evening sky Vanity let it be

ECHO Prom the Fagoo spur Let it be

SCENE The GADSBYS bungalow in the Plains Time 11 A M on a Sunday
morning Captain GADSBY in his shirtsleeves is bending over a
complete set of Hussars equipment from saddle to picketingrope which
is neatly spread over the floor of his study He is smoking an unclean
briar and his forehead is puckered with thought

Capt G To himself fingering a headstall Jacks an ass Theres
enough brass on this to load a muleand if the Americans know anything
about anything it can be cut down to a bit only Dont want the
wateringbridle either HumbugHalf a dozen sets of chains and
pulleys for one horse Rot Scratching his head Now lets consider
it all over from the beginning By Jove Ive forgotten the scale of
weights Never mind Keep the bit only and eliminate every boss from
the crupper to breastplate No breastplate at all Simple leather strap
across the breastlike the Russians Hi Jack never thought of that

Mrs G Entering hastily her hand bound in a cloth Oh Pip Ive
scalded my hand over that horrid horrid Tiparee jam

Capt G Absently Eh Whaat

Mrs G With roundeyed reproach Ive scalded it awfully Arent you
sorry And I did so want that jam to jam properly

Capt G Poor little woman Let me kiss the place and make it well
Unrolling bandage You small sinner Wheres that scald I cant see
it

Mrs G On the top of the little finger ThereIts a most normous
big burn

Capt G Kissing little finger Baby Let Hyder look after the jam
You know I dont care for sweets

Mrs G IndeedPip

Capt G Not of that kind anyhow And now run along Minnie and leave
me to my own base devices Im busy

Mrs G Calmly settling herself in long chair So I see What a mess
youre making Why have you brought all that smelly leather stuff into
the house

Capt G To play with Do you mind dear

Mrs G Let me play too Id like it

Capt G Im afraid you wouldnt PussyDont you think that jam will
burn or whatever it is that jam does when its not looked after by a
clever little housekeeper

Mrs G I thought you said Hyder could attend to it I left him in the
veranda stirringwhen I hurt myself so

Capt G His eye returning to the equipment Pooor little
womanThree pounds four and seven is three eleven and that can be cut
down to two eight with just a leetle care without weakening anything
Farriery is all rot in incompetent hands Whats the use of a shoecase
when a mans scouting He cant stick it on with a licklike a
stampthe shoe Skittles

Mrs G Whats skittles Pah What is this leather cleaned with

Capt G Cream and champagne andLook here dear do you really want to
talk to me about anything important

Mrs G No Ive done my accounts and I thought Id like to see what
youre doing

Capt G Well love now youve seen andWould you mindThat is to
sayMinnie I really am busy

Mrs G You want me to go

Capt G Yes dear for a little while This tobacco will hang in your
dress and saddlery doesnt interest you

Mrs G Everything you do interests me Pip

Capt G Yes I know I know dear Ill tell you all about it some day
when Ive put a head on this thing In the meantime

Mrs G Im to be turned out of the room like a troublesome child

Capt G Noo I dont mean that exactly But you see I shall be
tramping up and down shifting these things to and fro and I shall be
in your way Dont you think so

Mrs G Cant I lift them about Let me try Reaches forward to
troopers saddle

Capt G Good gracious child dont touch it Youll hurt yourself
Picking up saddle Little girls arent expected to handle numdahs
Now where would you like it put Holds saddle above his head

Mrs G A break in her voice Nowhere Pip how good you areand how
strong Oh whats that ugly red streak inside your arm

Capt G Lowering saddle quickly Nothing Its a mark of sorts
Aside And Jacks coming to tiffin with his notions all cut and dried

Mrs G I know its a mark but Ive never seen it before It runs all
up the arm What is it

Capt G A cutif you want to know

Mrs G Want to know Of course I do I cant have my husband cut to
pieces in this way How did it come Was it an accident Tell me Pip

Capt G Grimly No Twasnt an accident I got itfrom a manin
Afghanistan

Mrs G In action Oh Pip and you never told me

Capt G Id forgotten all about it

Mrs G Hold up your arm What a horrid ugly scar Are you sure it
doesnt hurt now How did the man give it you

Capt G Desperately looking at his watch With a knife I came
downold Van Loo did thats to sayand fell on my leg so I couldnt
run And then this man came up and began chopping at me as I sprawled

Mrs G Oh dont dont Thats enoughWell what happened

Capt G I couldnt get to my holster and Mafflin came round the corner
and stopped the performance

Mrs G How Hes such a lazy man I dont believe he did

Capt G Dont you I dont think the man had much doubt about it Jack
cut his head off

Mrs G Cuthisheadoff With one blow as they say in the books

Capt G Im not sure I was too interested in myself to know much about
it Anyhow the head was off and Jack was punching old Van Loo in the
ribs to make him get up Now you know all about it dear and now

Mrs G You want me to go of course You never told me about this
though Ive been married to you for ever so long and you never would
have told me if I hadnt found out and you never do tell me anything
about yourself or what you do or what you take an interest in

Capt G Darling Im always with you arent I

Mrs G Always in my pocket you were going to say I know you are but
you are always thinking away from me

Capt G Trying to hide a smile Am I I wasnt aware of it Im
awfly sorry

Mrs G Piteously Oh dont make fun of me Pip you know what I
mean When you are reading one of those things about Cavalry by that
idiotic Princewhy doesnt he be a Prince instead of a stableboy

Capt G Prince Kraft a stableboyOh my Aunt Never mind dear You
were going to say

Mrs G It doesnt matter you dont care for what I say Onlyonly
you get up and walk about the room staring in front of you and then
Mafflin comes in to dinner and after Im in the drawingroom I can
hear you and him talking and talking and talking about things I cant
understand andoh I get so tired and feel so lonelyI dont want to
complain and be a trouble Pip but I do indeed I do

Capt G My poor darling I never thought of that Why dont you ask
some nice people in to dinner

Mrs G Nice people Where am I to find them Horrid frumps And if I
did I shouldnt be amused You know I only want you

Capt G And you have me surely Sweetheart

Mrs G I have not Pip why dont you take me into your life

Capt G More than I do That would be difficult dear

Mrs G Yes I suppose it wouldto you Im no help to youno
companion to you and you like to have it so

Capt G Arent you a little unreasonable Pussy

Mrs G Stamping her foot Im the most reasonable woman in the
worldwhen Im treated properly

Capt G And since when have I been treating you improperly

Mrs G Alwaysand since the beginning You know you have

Capt G I dont but Im willing to be convinced

Mrs G Pointing to saddlery There

Capt G How do you mean

Mrs G What does all that mean Why am I not to be told Is it so
precious

Capt G I forget its exact Government value just at present It means
that it is a great deal too heavy

Mrs G Then why do you touch it

Capt G To make it lighter See here little love Ive one notion
and Jack has another but we are both agreed that all this equipment is
about thirty pounds too heavy The thing is how to cut it down without
weakening any part of it and at the same time allowing the trooper
to carry everything he wants for his own comfortsocks and shirts and
things of that kind

Mrs G Why doesnt he pack them in a little trunk

Capt G Kissing her Oh you darling Pack them in a little trunk
indeed Hussars dont carry trunks and its a most important thing to
make the horse do all the carrying

Mrs G But why need you bother about it Youre not a trooper

Capt G No but I command a few score of him and equipment is nearly
everything in these days

Mrs G More than me

Capt G Stupid Of course not but its a matter that Im tremendously
interested in because if I or Jack or I and Jack work out some sort
of lighter saddlery and all that its possible that we may get it
adopted

Mrs G How

Capt G Sanctioned at Home where they will make a sealed patterna
pattern that all the saddlers must copyand so it will be used by all
the regiments

Mrs G And that interests you

Capt G Its part of my profession yknow and my profession is a good
deal to me Everything in a soldiers equipment is important and if we
can improve that equipment so much the better for the soldiers and for
us

Mrs G Whos us

Capt G Jack and I only Jacks notions are too radical Whats that
big sigh for Minnie

Mrs G Oh nothingand youve kept all this a secret from me Why

Capt G Not a secret exactly dear I didnt say anything about it to
you because I didnt think it would amuse you

Mrs G And am I only made to be amused

Capt G No of course I merely mean that it couldnt interest you

Mrs G Its your work andand if youd let me Id count all these
things up If they are too heavy you know by how much they are too
heavy and you must have a list of things made out to your scale of
lightness and

Capt G I have got both scales somewhere in my head but its hard to
tell how light you can make a headstall for instance until youve
actually had a model made

Mrs G But if you read out the list I could copy it down and pin it
up there just above your table Wouldnt that do

Capt G It would be awfly nice dear but it would be giving you
trouble for nothing I cant work that way I go by rule of thumb I
know the present scale of weights and the other onethe one that
Im trying to work towill shift and vary so much that I couldnt be
certain even if I wrote it down

Mrs G Im so sorry I thought I might help Is there anything else
that I could be of use in

Capt G Looking round the room I cant think of anything Youre
always helping me you know

Mrs G Am I How

Capt G You are of course and as long as youre near meI cant
explain exactly but its in the air

Mrs G And thats why you wanted to send me away

Capt G Thats only when Im trying to do workgrubby work like this

Mrs G Mafflins better then isnt he

Capt G Rashly Of course he is Jack and I have been thinking along
the same groove for two or three years about this equipment Its our
hobby and it may really be useful some day

Mrs G After a pause And thats all that you have away from me

Capt G It isnt very far away from you now Take care the oil on that
bit doesnt come off on your dress

Mrs G I wishI wish so much that I could really help you I believe I
couldif I left the room But thats not what I mean

Capt G Aside Give me patience I wish she would go Aloud I
assure you you cant do anything for me Minnie and I must really
settle down to this Wheres my pouch

Mrs G Crossing to writingtable Here you are Bear What a mess you
keep your table in

Capt G Don ttouch it Theres a method in my madness though you
mightnt think of it

Mrs G At table I want to lookDo you keep accounts Pip

Capt G Bending over saddlery Of a sort Are you rummaging among the
Troop papers Be careful

Mrs G Why I shant disturb anything Good gracious I had no idea
that you had anything to do with so many sick horses

Capt G Wish I hadnt but they insist on falling sick Minnie if
1 were you I really should not investigate those papers You may come
across something that you wont like

Mrs G Why will you always treat me like a child I know Im not
displacing the horrid things

Capt G Resignedly Very well then Dont blame me if anything
happens Play with the table and let me go on with the saddlery
Slipping hand into trouserspocket Oh the deuce

Mrs G Her back to G Whats that for

Capt G Nothing Aside Theres not much in it but I wish Id torn
it up

Mrs G Turning over contents of table I know youll hate me for
this but I do want to see what your work is like A pause Pip what
are farcybuds

Capt G Hah Would you really like to know They arent pretty things

Mrs G This Journal of Veterinary Science says they are of absorbing
interest Tell me

Capt G Aside It may turn her attention

Gives a long and designedly loathsome account of glanders and farcy

Mrs G Oh thats enough Dont go on

Capt G But you wanted to knowThen these things suppurate and
matterate and spread

Mrs G Pin youre making me sick Youre a horrid disgusting
schoolboy

Capt G On his knees among the bridles You asked to be told Its
not my fault if you worry me into talking about horrors

Mrs G Why didnt you say No

Capt G Good Heavens child Have you come in here simply to bully me

Mrs G I bully you How could I Youre so strong Hysterically
Strong enough to pick me up and put me outside the door and leave me
there to cry Arent you

Capt G It seems to me that youre an irrational little baby Are you
quite well

Mrs G Do I look ill Returning to table Who is your lady friend
with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside

Capt G Aside Then it wasnt locked up confound it Aloud
God made her therefore let her pass for a woman You remember what
farcybuds are like

Mrs G Showing envelope This has nothing to do with them Im going
to open it May I

Capt G Certainly if you want to Id sooner you didnt though I
dont ask to look at your letters to the Deercourt girl

Mrs G Youd better not Sir Takes letter from envelope Now may I
look If you say no I shall cry

Capt G Youve never cried in my knowledge of you and I dont believe
you could

Mrs G I feel very like it today Pip Dont be hard on me Reads
letter It begins in the middle without any Dear Captain Gadsby or
anything How funny

Capt G Aside No its not Dear Captain Gadsby or anything now
How funny

Mrs G What a strange letter Reads And so the moth has come
too near the candle at last and has been singed intoshall I say
Respectability I congratulate him and hope he will be as happy as he
deserves to be What does that mean Is she congratulating you about
our marriage

Capt G Yes I suppose so

Mrs G Still reading letter She seems to be a particular friend of
yours

Capt G Yes She was an excellent matron of sortsa Mrs
Herriottwife of a Colonel Herriott I used to know some of her people
at Home long agobefore I came out

Mrs G Some Colonels wives are youngas young as me I knew one who
was younger

Capt G Then it couldnt have been Mrs Herriott She was old enough to
have been your mother dear

Mrs G I remember now Mrs Scargill was talking about her at the
Dutfins tennis before you came for me on Tuesday Captain Mafflin
said she was a dear old woman Do you know I think Mafflin is a very
clumsy man with his feet

Capt G Aside Good old Jack Aloud Why dear

Mrs G He had put his cup down on the ground then and he literally
stepped into it Some of the tea spirted over my dressthe grey one I
meant to tell you about it before

Capt G Aside There are the makings of a strategist about Jack
though his methods are coarse Aloud Youd better get a new dress
then Aside Let us pray that that will turn her

Mrs G Oh it isnt stained in the least I only thought that Id tell
you Returning to letter What an extraordinary person Reads
But need I remind you that you have taken upon yourself a charge of
wardshipwhat in the world is a charge of wardshipwhich as you
yourself know may end in Consequences

Capt G Aside Its safest to let em see everything as they come
across it but seems to me that there are exceptions to the rule
Aloud I told you that there was nothing to be gained from rearranging
my table

Mrs G Absently What does the woman mean She goes on talking about
Consequencesalmost inevitable Consequences with a capital Cfor
half a page Flushing scarlet Oh good gracious How abominable

Capt G Promptly Do you think so Doesnt it show a sort of motherly
interest in us Aside Thank Heaven Harry always wrapped her meaning
up safely Aloud Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter
darling

Mrs G Its impertinentits simply horrid What right has this woman
to write in this way to you She oughtnt to

Capt G When you write to the Deercourt girl I notice that you
generally fill three or four sheets Cant you let an old woman babble
on paper once in a way She means well

Mrs G I dont care She shouldnt write and if she did you ought to
have shown me her letter

Capt G Cant you understand why I kept it to myself or must I explain
at lengthas I explained the farcybuds

Mrs G Furiously Pip I hate you This is as bad as those idiotic
saddlebags on the floor Never mind whether it would please me or not
you ought to have given it to me to read

Capt G It comes to the same thing You took it yourself

Mrs G Yes but if I hadnt taken it you wouldnt have said a word
I think this Harriet Herriottits like a name in a bookis an
interfering old Thing

Capt G Aside So long as you thoroughly understand that she is old
I dont much care what you think Aloud Very good dear Would you
like to write and tell her so Shes seven thousand miles away

Mrs G I dont want to have anything to do with her but you ought to
have told me Turning to last page of letter And she patronizes me
too Ive never seen her Reads I do not know how the world stands
with you in all human probability I shall never know but whatever I
may have said before I pray for her sake more than for yours that all
may be well I have learned what misery means and I dare not wish that
any one dear to you should share my knowledge

Capt G Good God Cant you leave that letter alone or at least
cant you refrain from reading it aloud Ive been through it once Put
it back on the desk Do you hear me

Mrs G Irresolutely I shshant Looks at Gs eyes Oh Pip
please I didnt mean to make you angryDeed I didnt Pip Im so
sorry I know Ive wasted your time

Capt G Grimly You have Now will you be good enough to goif
there is nothing more in my room that you are anxious to pry into

Mrs G Putting out her hands Oh Pip dont look at me like that
Ive never seen you look like that before and it huurts me Im sorry
I oughtnt to have been here at all andandandsobbing Oh be
good to me Be good to me Theres only youanywhere Breaks down in
long chair hiding face in cushions

Capt G Aside She doesnt know how she flicked me on the raw
Aloud bending over chair I didnt mean to be harsh dearI didnt
really You can stay here as long as you please and do what you please
Dont cry like that Youll make yourself sick Aside What on earth
has come over her Aloud Darling whats the matter with you

Mrs G Her face still hidden Let me golet me go to my own room
Onlyonly say you arent angry with me

Capt G Angry with you love Of course not I was angry with myself
Id lost my temper over the saddleryDont hide your face Pussy I
want to kiss it

Bends lower Mrs G slides right arm round his neck Several interludes
and much sobbing

Mrs G In a whisper I didnt mean about the jam when I came in to
tell you CAPT G Bother the jam and the equipment Interlude

Mrs G Still more faintly My finger wasnt scalded at all Iwanted
to speak to you aboutaboutsomething else andI didnt know how

Capt G Speak away then Looking into her eyes Eh Whaat Minnie
Here dont go away You dont mean

Mrs G Hysterically backing to portiere and hiding her face in its
folds Thethe Almost Inevitable Consequences Flits through portiere
as G attempts to catch her and bolts her self in her own room

Capt G His arms full of portiere Oh Sitting down heavily in
chair Im a brute a piga bully and a blackguard My poor poor
little darling Made to be amused only

THE SWELLING OF JORDAN

If thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee then how
canst thou contend with horses And if in the land of peace wherein thou
trustedst they wearied thee then how wilt thou do in the swelling of
Jordan

SCENE The GADSBYS bungalow in the Plains on a January morning Mrs G

Capt M Isnt he our InspectorGeneral of Cavalry Doesnt he come down

Dont wriggle Brigadier Give us your private opinion on the way the
third squadron went past Trifle ragged werent they

Capt G A bigger set of tailors than the new draft I dont wish to see
Theyve given me more than my fair shareknocking the squadron out of
shape Its sickening

Capt M When youre in command youll do better young un Cantyou
walk yet Grip my finger and try To G Twont hurt his hocks will
it

Capt G Oh no Dont let him flop though or hell lick all the
blacking off your boots

Mrs G Within Whos destroying my sons character

Capt M And my Godsons Im ashamed of you Gaddy Punch your father
in the eye Jack Dont you stand it Hit him again

Capt G Sotto voce Put The Butcha down and come to the end of the
veranda Id rather the Wife didnt hearjust now

Capt M You look awfly serious Anything wrong

Capt G Depends on your view entirely I say Jack you wont think
more hardly of me than you can help will you Come further this
wayThe fact of the matter is that Ive made up my mindat least Im
thinking seriously ofcutting the Service

Capt M Hwhatt

Capt G Dont shout Im going to send in my papers

Capt M You Are you mad

Capt G Noonly married

Capt M Look here Whats the meaning of it all You never intend to
leave us You cant Isnt the best squadron of the best regiment of the
best cavalry in all the world good enough for you

Capt G Jerking his head over his shoulder She doesnt seem to
thrive in this Godforsaken country and theres The Butcha to be
considered and all that you know

Capt M Does she say that she doesnt like India

Capt G Thats the worst of it She wont for fear of leaving me

Capt M What are the Hills made for

Capt G Not for my wife at any rate

Capt M You know too much Gaddy andI dont like you any the better
for it

Capt G Never mind that She wants England and The Butcha would be all
the better for it Im going to chuck You dont understand

Capt M Hotly I understand thisOne hundred and thirtyseven new
horse to be licked into shape somehow before Luck comes round again a
hairyheeled draft wholl give more trouble than the horses a camp next
cold weather for a certainty ourselves the first on the roster the
Russian shindy ready to come to a head at five minutes notice and you
the best of us all backing out of it all Think a little Gaddy You
wont do it

Capt G Hang it a man has some duties toward his family I suppose

Capt M I remember a man though who told me the night after
Amdheran when we were picketed under Jagai and hed left his swordby
the way did you ever pay Ranken for that swordin an Utmanzais
headthat man told me that hed stick by me and the Pinks as long as
he lived I dont blame him for not sticking by meIm not much of a
manbut I do blame him for not sticking by the Pink Hussars

Capt G Uneasily We were little more than boys then Cant you see
Jack how things stand Tisnt as if we were serving for our bread
Weve all of us more or less got the filthy lucre Im luckier than
some perhaps Theres no call for me to serve on

Capt M None in the world for you or for us except the Regimental If
you dont choose to answer to that of course

Capt G Dont be too hard on a man You know that a lot of us only take
up the thing for a few years and then go back to Town and catch on with
the rest

Capt M Not lots and they arent some of Us

Capt G And then there are ones affairs at Home to be consideredmy
place and the rents and all that I dont suppose my father can last
much longer and that means the title and so on

Capt M Fraid you wont be entered in the Stud Book correctly unless
you go Home Take six months then and come out in October If I could
slay off a brother or two I spose I should be a Marquis of sorts
Any fool can be that but it needs men Gaddymen like youto lead
flanking squadrons properly Dont you delude yourself into the belief
that youre going Home to take your place and prance about among
pinknosed Kabuli dowagers You arent built that way I know better

Capt G A man has a right to live his life as happily as he can You
arent married

Capt M Nopraise be to Providence and the one or two women who have
had the good sense to jawab me

Capt G Then you dont know what it is to go into your own room and see
your wifes head on the pillow and when everything else is safe and the
house shut up for the night to wonder whether the roofbeams wont give
and kill her

Capt M Aside Revelations first and second Aloud Soo I knew
a man who got squiffy at our Mess once and confided to me that he never
helped his wife on to her horse without praying that shed break her
neck before she came back All husbands arent alike you see

Capt G What on earth has that to do with my case The man must ha
been mad or his wife as bad as they make em

Capt M Aside No fault of yours if either werent all you say
Youve forgotten the time when you were insane about the Herriott woman
You always were a good hand at forgetting Aloud Not more mad than
men who go to the other extreme Be reasonable Gaddy Your roofbeams
are sound enough

Capt G That was only a way of speaking Ive been uneasy and worried
about the Wife ever since that awful business three years agowhenI
nearly lost her Can you wonder

Capt M Oh a shell never falls twice in the same place Youve paid
your toll to misfortunewhy should your Wife be picked out more than
anybody elses

Capt G I can talk just as reasonably as you can but you dont
understandyou dont understand And then theres The Butcha Deuce
knows where the Ayah takes him to sit in the evening He has a bit of a
cough Havent you noticed it

Capt M Bosh The Brigadiers jumping out of his skin with pure
condition Hes got a muzzle like a roseleaf and the chest of a
twoyearold Whats demoralized you

Capt G Funk Thats the long and the short of it Funk

Capt M But what is there to funk

Capt G Everything Its ghastly

Capt M Ah I see You dont want to fight And by Jingo when we do
 Youve got the kid youve got the Wife
 Youve got the money too
Thats about the case eh

Capt G I suppose thats it But its not for myself Its because of
them At least I think it is

Capt M Are you sure Looking at the matter in a coldblooded light
the Wife is provided for even if you were wiped out tonight She has
an ancestral home to go to money and the Brigadier to carry on the
illustrious name

Capt G Then it is for myself or because they are part of me You dont
see it My lifes so good so pleasant as it is that I want to make it
quite safe Cant you understand

Capt M Perfectly Shelterpit for the Offcers charger as they say
in the Line

Capt G And I have everything to my hand to make it so Im sick of the
strain and the worry for their sakes out here and there isnt a single
real difficulty to prevent my dropping it altogether Itll only cost
meJack I hope youll never know the shame that Ive been going
through for the past six months

Capt M Hold on there I dont wish to be told Every man has his moods
and tenses sometimes

Capt G Laughing bitterly Has he What do you call craning over to
see where your nearfore lands

Capt M In my case it means that I have been on the Considerable Bend
and have come to parade with a Head and a Hand It passes in three
strides

Capt G Lowering voice It never passes with me Jack Im always
thinking about it Phil Gadsby funking a fall on parade Sweet picture
isnt it Draw it for me

Capt M Gravely Heaven forbid A man like you cant be as bad as
that A fall is no nice thing but one never gives it a thought

Capt G Doesnt one Wait till youve got a wife and a youngster of
your own and then youll know how the roar of the squadron behind you
turns you cold all up the back

Capt M Aside And this man led at Amdheran after Bagal Deasin went
under and we were all mixed up together and he came out of the snow
dripping like a butcher Aloud Skittles The men can always open out
and you can always pick your way more or less We havent the dust to
bother us as the men have and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a
man

Capt G Neveras long as he can see But did they open out for poor
Errington

Capt M Oh this is childish

Capt G I know it is worse than that I dont care Youve ridden
Van Loo Is he the sort of brute to pick his wayspecially when were
coming up in column of troop with any pace on

Capt M Once in a Blue Moon do we gallop in column of troop and then
only to save time Arent three lengths enough for you

Capt G Yesquite enough They just allow for the full development of
the smash Im talking like a cur I know but I tell you that for the
past three months Ive felt every hoof of the squadron in the small of
my back every time that Ive led

Capt M But Gaddy this is awful

Capt G Isnt it lovely Isnt it royal A Captain of the Pink Hussars
watering up his charger before parade like the blasted boozing Colonel
of a Black Regiment

Capt M You never did

Capt G Once only He squelched like a mussuck and the
TroopSergeantMajor cocked his eye at me You know old Haffys eye I
was afraid to do it again

Capt M I should think so That was the best way to rupture old Van
Loos tummy and make him crumple you up You knew that

Capt G I didnt care It took the edge off him

Capt M Took the edge off him Gaddy youyouyou mustnt you
know Think of the men

Capt G Thats another thing I am afraid of Dyou spose they know

Capt M Lets hope not but theyre deadly quick to spot skirmlittle
things of that kind See here old man send the Wife Home for the hot
weather and come to Kashmir with me Well start a boat on the Dal or
cross the Rhotangshoot ibex or loafwhich you please Only come
Youre a bit off your oats and youre talking nonsense Look at the
Colonelswagbellied rascal that he is He has a wife and no end of a
bowwindow of his own Can any one of us ride round himchalkstones and
all I cant and I think I can shove a crock along a bit

Capt G Some men are different I havent any nerve Lord help me I
havent the nerve Ive taken up a hole and a half to get my knees well
under the wallets I cant help it Im so afraid of anything happening
to me On my soul I ought to be broke in front of the squadron for
cowardice

Capt M Ugly word that I should never have the courage to own up

Capt G I meant to lie about my reasons when I began butIve got out
of the habit of lying to you old man Jack you wontBut I know you
wont

Capt M Of course not Half aloud The Pinks are paying dearly for
their Pride

Capt G Eh Whaat

Capt M Dont you know The men have called Mrs Gadsby the Pride of
the Pink Hussars ever since she came to us

Capt G Tisnt her fault Dont think that Its all mine

Capt M What does she say

Capt G I havent exactly put it before her Shes the best little
woman in the world Jack and all thatbut she wouldnt counsel a man
to stick to his calling if it came between him and her At least I
think

Capt M Never mind Dont tell her what you told me Go on the Peerage
and LandedGentry tack

Capt G Shed see through it Shes five times cleverer than I am

Capt M Aside Then shell accept the sacrifice and think a little
bit worse of him for the rest of her days

Capt G Absently I say do you despise me

Capt M Queer way of putting it Have you ever been asked that
question Think a minute What answer used you to give

Capt G So bad as that Im not entitled to expect anything more but
its a bit hard when ones best friend turns round and

Capt M So I have found But you will have consolationsBailiffs
and Drains and Liquid Manure and the Primrose League and perhaps
if youre lucky the Colonelcy of a Yeomanry Cavalry Regimentall
uniform and no riding I believe How old are you

Capt G Thirtythree I know its

Capt M At forty youll be a fool of a J P landlord At fifty youll
own a bathchair and The Brigadier if he takes after you will be
fluttering the dovecotes ofwhats the particular dunghill youre going
to Also Mrs Gadsby will be fat

Capt G Limply This is rather more than a joke

Capt M Dyou think so Isnt cutting the Service a joke It generally
takes a man fifty years to arrive at it Youre quite right though It
is more than a joke Youve managed it in thirtythree

Capt G Dont make me feel worse than I do Will it satisfy you if I
own that I am a shirker a skrimshanker and a coward

Capt M It will not because Im the only man in the world who can talk
to you like this without being knocked down You mustnt take all that
Ive said to heart in this way I only spokea lot of it at leastout
of pure selfishness because becauseOh damn it all old manI
dont know what I shall do without you Of course youve got the money
and the place and all thatand there are two very good reasons why you
should take care of yourself

Capt G Doesnt make it any sweeter Im backing outI know I am I
always had a soft drop in me somewhereand I darent risk any danger to
them

Capt M Why in the world should you Youre bound to think of your
familybound to think Erhmm If I wasnt a younger son Id go
toobe shot if I wouldnt

Capt G Thank you Jack Its a kind lie but its the blackest youve
told for some time I know what Im doing and Im going into it with my
eyes open Old man I cant help it What would you do if you were in my
place

Capt M Aside Couldnt conceive any woman getting permanently
between me and the Regiment Aloud Cant say Very likely I should
do no better Im sorry for youawfly sorrybut if thems your
sentiments I believe I really do that you are acting wisely

Capt G Do you I hope you do In a whisper Jack be very sure of
yourself before you marry Im an ungrateful ruffian to say this but
marriageeven as good a marriage as mine has beenhampers a mans
work it cripples his swordarm and oh it plays Hell with his notions
of duty Sometimesgood and sweet as she issometimes I could wish
that I had kept my freedomNo I dont mean that exactly

Mrs G Coming down veranda What are you wagging your head over Pip

Capt M Turning quickly Me as usual The old sermon Your husband
is recommending me to get married Never saw such a oneideaed man

Mrs G Well why dont you I dare say you would make some woman very
happy

VOLUME VIII from MINE OWN PEOPLE

 The Recrudescence Of Imray

BIMI

THE orangoutang in the big iron cage lashed to the sheeppen began the
discussion The night was stiflingly hot and as Hans Breitmann and I
passed him dragging our bedding to the forepeak of the steamer he
roused himself and chattered obscenely He had been caught somewhere in
the Malayan Archipelago and was going to England to be exhibited at a
shilling a head For four days he had struggled yelled and wrenched at
the heavy iron bars of his prison without ceasing and had nearly slain
a Lascar incautious enough to come within reach of the great hairy paw

It would be well for you mine friend if you was a liddle seasick
said Hans Breitmann pausing by the cage You haf too much Ego in your
Cosmos

The orangoutangs arm slid out negligently from between the bars No one
would have believed that it would make a sudden snakelike rush at
the Germans breast The thin silk of the sleepingsuit tore out Hans
stepped back unconcernedly to pluck a banana from a bunch hanging close
to one of the boats

Too much Ego said he peeling the fruit and offering it to the caged
devil who was rending the silk to tatters

Then we laid out our bedding in the bows among the sleeping Lascars
to catch any breeze that the pace of the ship might give us The sea was
like smoky oil except where it turned to fire under our forefoot
and whirled back into the dark in smears of dull flame There was a
thunderstorm some miles away we could see the glimmer of the lightning
The ships cow distressed by the heat and the smell of the apebeast in
the cage lowed unhappily from time to time in exactly the same key as
the lookout man at the bows answered the hourly call from the bridge
The trampling tune of the engines was very distinct and the jarring
of the ashlift as it was tipped into the sea hurt the procession of
hushed noise Hans lay down by my side and lighted a goodnight cigar
This was naturally the beginning of conversation He owned a voice as
soothing as the wash of the sea and stores of experiences as vast as
the sea itself for his business in life was to wander up and down the
world collecting orchids and wild beasts and ethnological specimens for
German and American dealers I watched the glowing end of his cigar wax
and wane in the gloom as the sentences rose and fell till I was nearly
asleep The orangoutang troubled by some dream of the forests of his
freedom began to yell like a soul in purgatory and to wrench madly at
the bars of the cage

If he was out now dere would not be much of us left hereabouts said
Hans lazily He screams good See now how I shall tame him when he
stops himself

There was a pause in the outcry and from Hans mouth came an imitation
of a snakes hiss so perfect that I almost sprung to my feet The
sustained murderous sound ran along the deck and the wrenching at the
bars ceased The orangoutang was quaking in an ecstasy of pure terror

Dot stop him said Hans I learned dot trick in Mogoung Tanjong when
I was collecting liddle monkeys for some peoples in Berlin Efery one
in der world is afraid of der monkeys except der snake So I blay snake
against monkey and he keep quite still Dere was too much Ego in his
Cosmos Dot is der soulcustom of monkeys Are you asleep or will you
listen and I will tell a dale dot you shall not pelief

Theres no tale in the wide world that I cant believe I said

If you have learned pelief you haf learned somedings Now I shall try
your pelief Good When I was collecting dose liddle monkeysit was in
79 or 80 und I was in der islands of der Archipelagoover dere in
der darkhe pointed southward to New Guinea generallyMein Gott I
would sooner collect life red devils than liddle monkeys When
dey do not bite off your thumbs dey are always dying from
nostalgiahomesickfor dey haf der imperfect soul which is midway
arrested in defelopmentund too much Ego I was dere for nearly a year
und dere I found a man dot was called Bertran He was a Frenchman und
he was a goot mannaturalist to the bone Dey said he was an escaped
convict but he was a naturalist und dot was enough for me He would
call all her life beasts from der forests und dey would come I said
he was St Francis of Assisi in a new dransmigration produced und he
laughed und said he had never preach to der fishes He sold dem for
trepangbechedemer

Und dot man who was king of beaststamer men he had in der house
shush such anoder as dot devilanimal in der cagea great orangoutang
dot thought he was a man He haf found him when he was a childder
orangoutangund he was child and brother and opera comique all round to
Bertran He had his room in dot housenot a cage but a roommit a bed
and sheets and he would go to bed and get up in der morning and smoke
his cigar und eat his dinner mit Bertran und walk mit him handinhand
which was most horrible Herr Gott I haf seen dot beast throw himself
back in his chair and laugh when Bertran haf made fun of me He was
not a beast he was a man and he talked to Bertran und Bertran
comprehended for I have seen dem Und he was always politeful to me
except when I talk too long to Bertran und say nodings at all to him
Den he would pull me awaydis great dark devil mit his enormous paws
shush as if I was a child He was not a beast he was a man Dis I saw
pefore I know him three months und Bertran he haf saw the same and
Bimi der orangoutang haf understood us both mit his cigar between his
bigdog teeth und der blue gum

I was dere a year dere und at dere oder islandssomedimes for monkeys
and somedimes for butterflies und orchits One time Bertran says to me
dot he will be married because he hass found a girl dot was goot and
he inquire if this marrying idea was right I would not say pecause
it was not me dot was going to be married Den he go off courting der
girlshe was a halfcaste French girlvery pretty Haf you got a new
light for my cigar Oof Very pretty Only I say Haf you thought of
Bimi If he pulls me away when I talk to you what will he do to your
wife He will pull her in pieces If I was you Bertran I would gif my
wife for wedding present der stuff figure of Bimi By dot time I bad
learned somedings about der monkey peoples Shoot him says Bertran
He is your beast I said if he was mine he would be shot now

Den I felt at der back of my neck der fingers of Bimi Mein Gott I
tell you dot he talked through dose fingers It was der deafanddumb
alphabet all gomplete He slide his hairy arm round my neck and he tilt
up my chin and look into my face shust to see if I understood his talk
so well as he understood mine

See now dere says Bertran und you would shoot him while he is
cuddling you Dot is der Teuton ingrate

But I knew dot I had made Bimi a lifes enemy pecause his fingers haf
talk murder through the back of my neck Next dime I see Bimi dere was
a pistol in my belt und he touch it once and I open de breech to show
him it was loaded He haf seen der liddle monkeys killed in der woods
and he understood

So Bertran he was married and he forgot clean about Bimi dot was
skippin alone on the beach mit der haf of a human soul in his belly
I was see him skip und he took a big bough und thrash der sand till he
haf made a great hole like a grave So I says to Bertran For any sakes
kill Bimi He is mad mit der jealousy

Bertran haf said He is not mad at all He haf obey and love my wife
und if she speaks he will get her slippers und he looked at his wife
across der room She was a very pretty girl

Den I said to him Dost thou pretend to know monkeys und dis beast dot
is lashing himself mad upon der sands pecause you do not talk to him
Shoot him when he comes to der house for he haf der light in his eyes
dot means killingund killing Bimi come to der house but dere was
no light in his eyes It was all put away cunningso cunningund he
fetch der girl her slippers and Bertran turn to me und say Dost thou
know him in nine months more dan I haf known him in twelve years Shall a
child stab his fader I have fed him und he was my child Do not speak
this nonsense to my wife or to me any more

Dot next day Bertran came to my house to help me make some wood cases
for der specimens und he tell me dot he haf left his wife a liddle
while mit Bimi in der garden Den I finish my cases quick und I say
Let us go to your house und get a trink He laugh und say Come
along dry mans

His wife was not in der garden und Bimi did not come when Bertran
called Und his wife did not come when he called und he knocked at her
bedroom door und dot was shut tightlocked Den he looked at me und his
face was white I broke down der door mit my shoulder und der thatch of
der roof was torn into a great hole und der sun came in upon der floor
Haf you ever seen paper in der wastebasket or cards at whist on der
table scattered Dere was no wife dot could be seen I tell you dere was
noddings in dot room dot might be a woman Dere was stuff on der floor
und dot was all I looked at dese things und I was very sick but
Bertran looked a little longer at what was upon the floor und der walls
und der hole in der thatch Den he pegan to laugh soft and low und I
know und thank God dot he was mad He nefer cried he nefer prayed He
stood still in der doorway und laugh to himself Den he said She haf
locked herself in dis room and he haf torn up der thatch Fi donc Dot
is so We will mend der thatch und wait for Bimi He will surely come

I tell you we waited ten days in dot house after der room was made
into a room again and once or twice we saw Bimi comin a liddle way
from der woods He was afraid pecause he haf done wrong Bertran called
him when he was come to look on the tenth day und Bimi come skipping
along der beach und making noises mit a long piece of Nack hair in his
hands Den Bertran laugh and say Fi donc shust as if it was a glass
broken upon der table und Bimi come nearer und Bertran was honeysweet
in his voice and laughed to himself For three days he made love to
Bimi pecause Bimi would not let himself be touched Den Bimi come to
dinner at der same table mit us und der hair on his hands was all
black und thick mitmit what had dried on his hands Bertran gave him
sangaree till Bimi was drunk and stupid und den

Hans paused to puff at his cigar

And then said I

Und den Bertran kill him with his hands und I go for a walk upon der
heach It was Bertrans own piziness When I come back der ape he was
dead und Bertran he was dying abofe him but still he laughed a liddle
und low and he was quite content Now you know der formula uf der
strength of der orangoutangit is more as seven to one in relation to
man But Bertran he haf killed Bimi mit sooch dings as Gott gif him
Dot was der mericle

The infernal clamor in the cage recommenced Aha Dot friend of ours
haf still too much Ego in his Cosmos Be quiet thou

Hans hissed long and venomously We could hear the great beast quaking
in his cage

But why in the world didnt you help Bertran instead of letting him be
killed I asked

My friend said Hans composedly stretching himself to slumber it
was not nice even to mineself dot I should lif after I had seen dot room
wit der hole in der thatch Und Bertran he was her husband Goodnight
und sleep well




NAMGAY DOOLA

ONCE upon a time there was a king who lived on the road to Thibet very
many miles in the Himalaya Mountains His kingdom was 11000 feet above
the sea and exactly four miles square but most of the miles stood on
end owing to the nature of the country His revenues were rather less
than 400 pounds yearly and they were expended on the maintenance of one
elephant and a standing army of five men He was tributary to the Indian
government who allowed him certain sums for keeping a section of the
HimalayaThibet road in repair He further increased his revenues by
selling timber to the railway companies for he would cut the great
deodar trees in his own forest and they fell thundering into the Sutlej
River and were swept down to the Plains 300 miles away and became
railway ties Now and again this king whose name does not matter would
mount a ringstreaked horse and ride scores of miles to Simlatown to
confer with the lieutenantgovernor on matters of state or assure the
viceroy that his sword was at the service of the queenempress Then
the viceroy would cause a ruffle of drums to be sounded and the
ringstreaked horse and the cavalry of the statetwo men in
tattersand the herald who bore the Silver Stick before the king
would trot back to their own place which was between the tail of a
heavenclimbing glacier and a dark birch forest

Now from such a king always remembering that he possessed one
veritable elephant and could count his descent for 1200 years I
expected when it was my fate to wander through his dominions no more
than mere license to live

The night had closed in rain and rolling clouds blotted out the lights
of the villages in the valley Forty miles away untouched by cloud or
storm the white shoulder of Dongo Pathe Mountain of the Council of
the Godsupheld the evening star The monkeys sung sorrowfully to each
other as they hunted for dry roots in the ferndraped trees and the
last puff of the daywind brought from the unseen villages the scent
of damp wood smoke hot cakes dripping undergrowth and rotting
pinecones That smell is the true smell of the Himalayas and if it
once gets into the blood of a man he will at the last forgetting
everything else return to the Hills to die The clouds closed and the
smell went away and there remained nothing in all the world except
chilling white mists and the boom of the Sutlej River

A fattailed sheep who did not want to die bleated lamentably at
my tentdoor He was scuffling with the prime minister and the
directorgeneral of public education and he was a royal gift to me and
my camp servants I expressed my thanks suitably and inquired if I might
have audience of the king The prime minister readjusted his turbanit
had fallen off in the struggleand assured me that the king would
be very pleased to see me Therefore I dispatched two bottles as a
foretaste and when the sheep had entered upon another incarnation
climbed up to the kings palace through the wet He had sent his army
to escort me but it stayed to talk with my cook Soldiers are very much
alike all the world over

The palace was a fourroomed whitewashed mudandtimber house the
finest in all the Hills for a days journey The king was dressed in a
purple velvet jacket white muslin trousers and a saffronyellow turban
of price He gave me audience in a little carpeted room opening off the
palace courtyard which was occupied by the elephant of state The great
beast was sheeted and anchored from trunk to tail and the curve of his
back stood out against the sky line

The prime minister and the directorgeneral of public instruction were
present to introduce me but all the court had been dismissed lest
the two bottles aforesaid should corrupt their morals The king cast a
wreath of heavy scented flowers round my neck as I bowed and inquired
how my honored presence had the felicity to be I said that through
seeing his auspicious countenance the mists of the night had turned
into sunshine and that by reason of his beneficent sheep his good
deeds would be remembered by the gods He said that since I had set my
magnificent foot in his kingdom the crops would probably yield seventy
per cent more than the average I said that the fame of the king had
reached to the four corners of the earth and that the nations gnashed
their teeth when they heard daily of the glory of his realm and the
wisdom of his moonlike prime minister and lotuseyed directorgeneral
of public education

Then we sat down on clean white cushions and I was at the kings right
hand Three minutes later he was telling me that the condition of the
maize crop was something disgraceful and that the railway companies
would not pay him enough for his timber The talk shifted to and fro
with the bottles We discussed very many quaint things and the king
became confidential on the subject of government generally Most of all
he dwelt on the shortcomings of one of his subjects who from what I
could gather had been paralyzing the executive

In the old days said the king I could have ordered the elephant
yonder to trample him to death Now I must een send him seventy miles
across the hills to be tried and his keep for that time would be upon
the state And the elephant eats everything

What be the mans crimes Rajah Sahib said I

Firstly he is an outlander and no man of mine own people Secondly
since of my favor I gave him land upon his coming he refuses to pay
revenue Am I not the lord of the earth above and belowentitled by
right and custom to oneeighth of the crop Yet this devil establishing
himself refuses to pay a single tax and he brings a poisonous
spawn of babes

Cast him into jail I said

Sahib the king answered shifting a little on the cushions once and
only once in these forty years sickness came upon me so that I was not
able to go abroad In that hour I made a vow to my God that I would
never again cut man or woman from the light of the sun and the air of
God for I perceived the nature of the punishment How can I break my
vow Were it only the lopping off of a hand or a foot I should not
delay But even that is impossible now that the English have rule One
or another of my peoplehe looked obliquely at the directorgeneral
of public educationwould at once write a letter to the viceroy and
perhaps I should be deprived of that ruffle of drums

He unscrewed the mouthpiece of his silver waterpipe fitted a plain
amber one and passed the pipe to me Not content with refusing
revenue he continued this outlander refuses also to beegar this is
the corvee or forced labor on the roads and stirs my people up to the
like treason Yet he is if so he wills an expert logsnatcher There
is none better or bolder among my people to clear a block of the river
when the logs stick fast

But he worships strange gods said the prime minister deferentially

For that I have no concern said the king who was as tolerant as
Akbar in matters of belief To each man his own god and the fire or
Mother Earth for us all at the last It is the rebellion that offends
me

The king has an army I suggested Has not the king burned the mans
house and left him naked to the night dews

Nay A hut is a hut and it holds the life of a man But once I sent
my army against him when his excuses became wearisome Of their heads
he brake three across the top with a stick The other two men ran away
Also the guns would not shoot

I had seen the equipment of the infantry Onethird of it was an old
muzzleloading fowlingpiece with ragged rust holes where the nipples
should have been onethird a wirebound matchlock with a wormeaten
stock and onethird a fourbore flint duckgun without a flint

But it is to be remembered said the king reaching out for the
bottle that he is a very expert logsnatcher and a man of a merry
face What shall I do to him sahib

This was interesting The timid hillfolk would as soon have refused
taxes to their king as offerings to their gods The rebel must be a man
of character

If it be the kings permission I said I will not strike my tents
till the third day and I will see this man The mercy of the king is
godlike and rebellion is like unto the sin of witchcraft Moreover
both the bottles and another be empty

You have my leave to go said the king

Next morning the crier went through the stare proclaiming that there was
a logjam on the river and that it behooved all loyal subjects to clear
it The people poured down from their villages to the moist warm valley
of poppy fields and the king and I went with them

Hundreds of dressed deodar logs had caught on a snag of rock and the
river was bringing down more logs every minute to complete the blockade
The water snarled and wrenched and worried at the timber while the
population of the state prodded at the nearest logs with poles in
the hope of easing the pressure Then there went up a shout of Namgay
Doola Namgay Doola and a large redhaired villager hurried up
stripping off his clothes as he ran

That he is That is the rebel said the king Now will the dam be
cleared

But why has he red hair I asked since red hair among hillfolk is as
uncommon as blue or green

He is an outlander said the king Well done Oh well done

Namgay Doola had scrambled on the jam and was clawing out the butt of
a log with a rude sort of a boathook It slid forward slowly as an
alligator moves and three or four others followed it The green water
spouted through the gaps Then the villagers howled and shouted and
leaped among the logs pulling and pushing the obstinate timber and the
red head of Namgay Doola was chief among them all The logs swayed and
chafed and groaned as fresh consignments from upstream battered the now
weakening dam It gave way at last in a smother of foam racing butts
bobbing black heads and a confusion indescribable as the river tossed
everything before it I saw the red head go down with the last remnants
of the jam and disappear between the great grinding tree trunks It rose
close to the hank and blowing like a grampus Namgay Doola wiped the
water out of his eyes and made obeisance to the king

I had time to observe the man closely The virulent redness of his shock
head and beard was most startling and in the thicket of hair twinkled
above high cheekbones two very merry blue eyes He was indeed an
outlander but yet a Thibetan in language habit and attire He spoke
the Lepcha dialect with an indescribable softening of the gutturals It
was not so much a lisp as an accent

Whence comest thou I asked wondering

From Thibet He pointed across the hills and grinned That grin went
straight to my heart Mechanically I held out my hand and Namgay Doola
took it No pure Thibetan would have understood the meaning of the
gesture He went away to look for his clothes and as he climbed back to
his village I heard a joyous yell that seemed unaccountably familiar
It was the whooping of Namgay Doola

You see now said the king why I would not kill him He is a bold
man among my logs but and he shook his head like a schoolmaster I
know that before long there will be complaints of him in the court Let
us return to the palace and do justice

It was that kings custom to judge his subjects every day between eleven
and three oclock I heard him do justice equitably on weighty matters
of trespass slander and a little wifestealing Then his brow clouded
and he summoned me

Again it is Namgay Doola he said despairingly Not content with
refusing revenue on his own part he has bound half his village by an
oath to the like treason Never before has such a thing befallen me Nor
are my taxes heavy

A rabbitfaced villager with a blushrose stuck behind his ear
advanced trembling He had been in Namgay Doolas conspiracy but had
told everything and hoped for the kings favor

Oh king said I if it be the kings will let this matter stand
over till the morning Only the gods can do right in a hurry and it may
be that yonder villager has lied

Nay for I know the nature of Namgay Doola but since a guest asks
let the matter remain Wilt thou for my sake speak harshly to this
redheaded outlander He may listen to thee

I made an attempt that very evening but for the life of me I could not
keep my countenance Namgay Doola grinned so persuasively and began to
tell me about a big brown bear in a poppy field by the river Would
I care to shoot that bear I spoke austerely on the sin of detected
conspiracy and the certainty of punishment Namgay Doolas face clouded
for a moment Shortly afterward he withdrew from my tent and I heard
him singing softly among the pines The words were unintelligible to me
but the tune like his liquid insinuating speech seemed the ghost of
something strangely familiar

Dir hane mardiyemen dir To weeree ala gee crooned Namgay Doola
again and again and I racked my brain for that lost tune It was not
till after dinner that I discovered some one had cut a square foot of
velvet from the centre of my best cameracloth This made me so angry
that I wandered down the valley in the hope of meeting the big brown
bear I could hear him grunting like a discontented pig in the poppy
field as I waited shoulder deep in the dewdripping Indian corn to catch
him after his meal The moon was at full and drew out the scent of the
tasseled crop Then I heard the anguished bellow of a Himalayan cowone
of the little black crummies no bigger than Newfoundland dogs Two
shadows that looked like a bear and her cub hurried past me I was in
the act of firing when I saw that each bore a brilliant red head The
lesser animal was trailing something ropelike that left a dark track
on the path They were within six feet of me and the shadow of the
moonlight lay velvetblack on their faces Velvetblack was exactly the
word for by all the powers of moonlight they were masked in the velvet
of my cameracloth I marveled and went to bed

Next morning the kingdom was in an uproar Namgay Doola men said had
gone forth in the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a
cow belonging to the rabbitfaced villager who had betrayed him It was
sacrilege unspeakable against the holy cow The state desired his blood
but he had retreated into his hut barricaded the doors and windows with
big stones and defied the world

The king and I and the populace approached the hut cautiously There was
no hope of capturing our man without loss of life for from a hole in
the wall projected the muzzle of an extremely wellcaredfor gunthe
only gun in the state that could shoot Namgay Doola had narrowly missed
a villager just before we came up

The standing army stood

It could do no more for when it advanced pieces of sharp shale flew
from the windows To these were added from time to time showers of
scalding water We saw red beads bobbing up and down within The family
of Namgay Doola were aiding their sire Bloodcurdling yells of defiance
were the only answer to our prayers

Never said the king puffing has such a thing befallen my state
Next year I will certainly buy a little cannon He looked at me
imploringly

Is there any priest in the kingdom to whom he will listen said I for
a light was beginning to break upon me

He worships his own god said the prime minister We can but starve
him out

Let the white man approach said Namgay Doola from within All others
I will kill Send me the white man

The door was thrown open and I entered the smoky interior of a Thibetan
hut crammed with children And every child had flaming red hair A
freshgathered cows tail lay on the floor and by its side two pieces
of black velvetmy black velvetrudely hacked into the semblance of
masks

And what is this shame Namgay Doola I asked

He grinned more charmingly than ever There is no shame said he I
did but cut off the tail of that mans cow He betrayed me I was minded
to shoot him sahib but not to death Indeed not to death only in the
legs

And why at all since it is the custom to pay revenue to the king Why
at all

By the god of my father I cannot tell said Namgay Doola

And who was thy father

The same that had this gun He showed me his weapon a Tower musket
bearing date 1832 and the stamp of the Honorable East India Company

And thy fathers name said I

He obeyed and I understood whence the puzzling accent in his speech
came Thimla Dhula said he excitedly To this hour I worship his
god

May I see that god

In a little whileat twilight time

Rememberest thou aught of thy fathers speech

It is long ago But there was one word which he said often Thus
Shun Then I and my brethren stood upon our feet our hands to our
sides thus

Even so And what was thy mother

A woman of the Hills We be Lepchas of Darjiling but me they call an
outlander because my hair is as thou seest

The Thibetan woman his wife touched him on the arm gently The long
parley outside the fort had lasted far into the day It was now close
upon twilightthe hour of the Angelus Very solemnly the redheaded
brats rose from the floor and formed a semicircle Namgay Doola laid his
gun aside lighted a little oillamp and set it before a recess in
the wall Pulling back a wisp of dirty cloth he revealed a worn brass
crucifix leaning against the helmet badge of a longforgotten East India
Companys regiment Thus did my father he said crossing himself
clumsily The wife and children followed suit Then all together they
struck up the wailing cham that I heard on the hillside

Dir bane mardiyemen dir To weeree ala gee

I was puzzled no longer Again and again they sung as if their hearts
would break their version of the chorus of The Wearing of the Green

 Theyre hanging men and women too
 For the wearing of the green

A diabolical inspiration came to me One of the brats a boy about eight
years oldcould he have been in the fields last nightwas watching
me as he sung I pulled out a rupee held the coin between finger and
thumb and lookedonly lookedat the gun leaning against the wall
A grin of brilliant and perfect comprehension overspread his
porringerlike face Never for an instant stopping the song he held out
his hand for the money and then slid the gun to my hand I might
have shot Namgay Doola dead as he chanted but I was satisfied The
inevitable bloodinstinct held true Namgay Doola drew the curtain
across the recess Angelus was over

Thus my father sung There was much more but I have forgotten and I
do not know the purport of even these words but it may be that the god
will understand I am not of this people and I will not pay revenue

And why

Again that soulcompelling grin What occupation would be to me between
crop and crop It is better than scaring bears But these people do not
understand

He picked the masks off the floor and looked in my face as simply as a
child

By what road didst thou attain knowledge to make those deviltries I
said pointing

I cannot tell I am but a Lepcha of Darjiling and yet the stuff

Which thou hast stolen said I

Nay surely Did I steal I desired it so The stuffthe stuff What
else should I have done with the stuff He twisted the velvet between
his fingers

But the sin of maiming the cowconsider that

Oh sahib the man betrayed me the heifers tail waved in the
moonlight and I had my knife What else should I have done The tail
came off ere I was aware Sahib thou knowest more than I

That is true said I Stay within the door I go to speak to the
king The population of the state were ranged on the hillside I went
forth and spoke

O king said I touching this man there be two courses open to thy
wisdom Thou canst either hang him from a treehim and his broodtill
there remains no hair that is red within thy land

Nay said the king Why should I hurt the little children

They had poured out of the hut and were making plump obeisances to
everybody Namgay Doola waited at the door with his gun across his arm

Or thou canst discarding their impiety of the cowmaiming raise him
to honor in thy army He comes of a race that will not pay revenue A
red flame is in his blood which comes out at the top of his head in that
glowing hair Make him chief of thy army Give him honor as may befall
and full allowance of work but look to it oh king that neither he
nor his hold a foot of earth from thee henceforward Feed him with words
and favor and also liquor from certain bottles that thou knowest of
and he will be a bulwark of defense But deny him even a tuftlet of
grass for his own This is the nature that God has given him Moreover
he has brethren

The state groaned unanimously

But if his brethren come they will surely fight with each other till
they die or else the one will always give information concerning the
other Shall he be of thy army oh king Choose

The king bowed his head and I said

Come forth Namgay Doola and command the kings army Thy name shall
no more be Namgay in the mouths of men but Patsay Doola for as thou
hast truly said I know

Then Namgay Doola never christened Patsay Doola son of Timlay
Doolawhich is Tim Doolanclasped the kings feet cuffed the standing
army and hurried in an agony of contrition from temple to temple making
offerings for the sin of the cattlemaiming

And the king was so pleased with my perspicacity that he offered to
sell me a village for 20 pounds sterling But I buy no village in
the Himalayas so long as one red head flares between the tail of the
heavenclimbing glacier and the dark birch forest

I know that breed




THE RECRUDESCENCE OF IMRAY

Imray had achieved the impossible Without warning for no conceivable
motive in his youth and at the threshold of his career he had chosen
to disappear from the worldwhich is to say the little Indian station
where he lived Upon a day he was alive well happy and in great
evidence at his club among the billiardtables Upon a morning he was
not and no manner of search could make sure where he might be He
had stepped out of his place he had not appeared at his office at the
proper time and his dogcart was not upon the public roads For these
reasons and because he was hampering in a microscopical degree the
administration of the Indian Empire the Indian Empire paused for one
microscopical moment to make inquiry into the fate of Imray Ponds were
dragged wells were plumbed telegrams were dispatched down the lines
of railways and to the nearest seaport town1200 miles awaybut Imray
was not at the end of the dragropes nor the telegrams He was gone
and his place knew him no more Then the work of the great Indian Empire
swept forward because it could not be delayed and Imray from being a
man became a mysterysuch a thing as men talk over at their tables
in the club for a month and then forget utterly His guns horses and
carts were sold to the highest bidder His superior officer wrote
an absurd letter to his mother saying that Imray had unaccountably
disappeared and his bungalow stood empty on the road

After three or four months of the scorching hot weather had gone by
my friend Strickland of the police force saw fit to rent the bungalow
from the native landlord This was before he was engaged to Miss
Youghalan affair which has been described in another placeand while
he was pursuing his investigations into native life His own life was
sufficiently peculiar and men complained of his manners and customs
There was always food in his house but there were no regular times for
meals He ate standing up and walking about whatever he might find on
the sideboard and this is not good for the insides of human beings
His domestic equipment was limited to six rifles three shotguns five
saddles and a collection of stiffjointed masheer rods bigger and
stronger than the largest salmon rods These things occupied one half of
his bungalow and the other half was given up to Strickland and his dog
Tietjensan enormous Rampur slut who sung when she was ordered and
devoured daily the rations of two men She spoke to Strickland in a
language of her own and whenever in her walks abroad she saw things
calculated to destroy the peace of Her Majesty the Queen Empress she
returned to her master and gave him information Strickland would
take steps at once and the end of his labors was trouble and fine and
imprisonment for other people The natives believed that Tietjens was a
familiar spirit and treated her with the great reverence that is born
of hate and fear One room in the bungalow was set apart for her special
use She owned a bedstead a blanket and a drinkingtrough and if any
one came into Stricklands room at night her custom was to knock down
the invader and give tongue till some one came with a light Strickland
owes his life to her When he was on the frontier in search of the local
murderer who came in the grey dawn to send Strickland much further
than the Andaman Islands Tietjens caught him as he was crawling into
Stricklands tent with a dagger between his teeth and after his record
of iniquity was established in the eyes of the law he was hanged From
that date Tietjens wore a collar of rough silver and employed a monogram
on her night blanket and the blanket was doublewoven Kashmir cloth
for she was a delicate dog

Under no circumstances would she be separated from Strickland and when
he was ill with fever she made great trouble for the doctors because she
did not know how to help her master and would not allow another creature
to attempt aid Macarnaght of the Indian Medical Service beat her over
the head with a gun before she could understand that she must give room
for those who could give quinine

A short time after Strickland had taken Imrays bungalow my business
took me through that station and naturally the club quarters being
full I quartered myself upon Strickland It was a desirable bungalow
eightroomed and heavily thatched against any chance of leakage from
rain Under the pitch of the roof ran a ceiling cloth which looked just
as nice as a whitewashed ceiling The landlord had repainted it when
Strickland took the bungalow and unless you knew how Indian bungalows
were built you would never have suspected that above the cloth lay the
dark threecornered cavern of the roof where the beams and the under
side of the thatch harbored all manner of rats hats ants and other
things

Tietjens met me in the veranda with a bay like the boom of the bells of
St Pauls and put her paws on my shoulders and said she was glad to
see me Strickland had contrived to put together that sort of meal which
he called lunch and immediately after it was finished went out about
his business I was left alone with Tietjens and my own affairs The
heat of the summer had broken up and given place to the warm damp of
the rains There was no motion in the heated air but the rain fell like
bayonet rods on the earth and flung up a blue mist where it splashed
back again The bamboos and the custard apples the poinsettias and
the mangotrees in the garden stood still while the warm water lashed
through them and the frogs began to sing among the aloe hedges A
little before the light failed and when the rain was at its worst I
sat in the back veranda and heard the water roar from the eaves and
scratched myself because I was covered with the thing they called
prickly heat Tietjens came out with me and put her head in my lap and
was very sorrowful so I gave her biscuits when tea was ready and I
took tea in the back veranda on account of the little coolness I
found there The rooms of the house were dark behind me I could smell
Stricklands saddlery and the oil on his guns and I did not the least
desire to sit among these things My own servant came to me in the
twilight the muslin of his clothes clinging tightly to his drenched
body and told me that a gentleman had called and wished to see some
one Very much against my will and because of the darkness of the
rooms I went into the naked drawingroom telling my man to bring the
lights There might or might not have been a caller in the roomit
seems to me that I saw a figure by one of the windows but when the
lights came there was nothing save the spikes of the rain without and
the smell of the drinking earth in my nostrils I explained to my man
that he was no wiser than he ought to be and went back to the veranda
to talk to Tietjens She had gone out into the wet and I could hardly
coax her back to meeven with biscuits with sugar on top Strickland
rode back dripping wet just before dinner and the first thing he said
was

Has any one called

I explained with apologies that my servant had called me into the
drawingroom on a false alarm or that some loafer had tried to call
on Strickland and thinking better of it fled after giving his name
Strickland ordered dinner without comment and since it was a real
dinner with white tablecloth attached we sat down

At nine oclock Strickland wanted to go to bed and I was tired too
Tietjens who had been lying underneath the table rose up and went into
the least exposed veranda as soon as her master moved to his own room
which was next to the stately chamber set apart for Tietjens If a mere
wife had wished to sleep outofdoors in that pelting rain it would not
have mattered but Tietjens was a dog and therefore the better animal
I looked at Strickland expecting to see him flog her with a whip He
smiled queerly as a man would smile after telling some hideous domestic
tragedy She has done this ever since I moved in here

The dog was Stricklands dog so I said nothing but I felt all that
Strickland felt in being made light of Tietjens encamped outside my
bedroom window and storm after storm came up thundered on the thatch
and died away The lightning spattered the sky as a thrown egg spattered
a barn door but the light was pale blue not yellow and looking
through my slit bamboo blinds I could see the great dog standing not
sleeping in the veranda the hackles alift on her back and her feet
planted as tensely as the drawn wire rope of a suspension bridge In the
very short pauses of the thunder I tried to sleep but it seemed that
some one wanted me very badly He whoever he was was trying to call
me by name but his voice was no more than a husky whisper Then the
thunder ceased and Tietjens went into the garden and howled at the low
moon Somebody tried to open my door and walked about and through the
house and stood breathing heavily in the verandas and just when I was
falling asleep I fancied that I heard a wild hammering and clamoring
above my head or on the door

I ran into Stricklands room and asked him whether he was ill and had
been calling for me He was lying on the bed halfdressed with a pipe
in his mouth I thought youd come he said Have I been walking
around the house at all

I explained that he had been in the diningroom and the smokingroom and
two or three other places and he laughed and told me to go back to bed
I went back to bed and slept till the morning but in all my dreams
I was sure I was doing some one an injustice in not attending to
his wants What those wants were I could not tell but a fluttering
whispering boltfumbling luring loitering some one was reproaching
me for my slackness and through all the dreams I heard the howling of
Tietjens in the garden and the thrashing of the rain

I was in that house for two days and Strickland went to his office
daily leaving me alone for eight or ten hours a day with Tietjens for
my only companion As long as the full light lasted I was comfortable
and so was Tietjens but in the twilight she and I moved into the back
veranda and cuddled each other for company We were alone in the house
but for all that it was fully occupied by a tenant with whom I had
no desire to interfere I never saw him but I could see the curtains
between the rooms quivering where he had just passed through I could
hear the chairs creaking as the bamboos sprung under a weight that had
just quitted them and I could feel when I went to get a book from
the diningroom that somebody was waiting in the shadows of the front
veranda till I should have gone away Tietjens made the twilight more
interesting by glaring into the darkened rooms with every hair erect
and following the motions of something that I could not see She never
entered the rooms but her eyes moved and that was quite sufficient
Only when my servant came to trim the lamps and make all light and
habitable she would come in with me and spend her time sitting on her
haunches watching an invisible extra man as he moved about behind my
shoulder Dogs are cheerful companions

I explained to Strickland gently as might be that I would go over to
the club and find for myself quarters there I admired his hospitality
was pleased with his guns and rods but I did not much care for his
house and its atmosphere He heard me out to the end and then smiled
very wearily but without contempt for he is a man who understands
things Stay on he said and see what this thing means All you have
talked about I have known since I took the bungalow Stay on and wait
Tietjens has left me Are you going too

I had seen him through one little affair connected with an idol that had
brought me to the doors of a lunatic asylum and I had no desire to help
him through further experiences He was a man to whom unpleasantnesses
arrived as do dinners to ordinary people

Therefore I explained more clearly than ever that I liked him immensely
and would be happy to see him in the daytime but that I didnt care to
sleep under his roof This was after dinner when Tietjens had gone out
to lie in the veranda

Pon my soul I dont wonder said Strickland with his eyes on the
ceilingcloth Look at that

The tails of two snakes were hanging between the cloth and the cornice
of the wall They threw long shadows in the lamplight If you are
afraid of snakes of coursesaid Strickland I hate and fear snakes
because if you look into the eyes of any snake you will see that it
knows all and more of mans fall and that it feels all the contempt
that the devil felt when Adam was evicted from Eden Besides which its
bite is generally fatal and it bursts up trouser legs

You ought to get your thatch overhauled I said Give me a masheer
rod and well poke em down

Theyll hide among the roof beams said Strickland I cant stand
snakes overhead Im going up If I shake em down stand by with a
cleaningrod and break their backs

I was not anxious to assist Strickland in his work but I took the
loadingrod and waited in the diningroom while Strickland brought a
gardeners ladder from the veranda and set it against the side of the
room The snake tails drew themselves up and disappeared We could hear
the dry rushing scuttle of long bodies running over the baggy cloth
Strickland took a lamp with him while I tried to make clear the danger
of hunting roof snakes between a ceiling cloth and a thatch apart from
the deterioration of property caused by ripping out ceilingcloths

N o n s en s e said Strickland Theyre sure to hide near the walls
by the cloth The bricks are too cold for em and the heat of the room
is just what they like He put his hands to the corner of the cloth
and ripped the rotten stuff from the cornice It gave great sound of
tearing and Strickland put his head through the opening into the
dark of the angle of the roof beams I set my teeth and lifted the
loadingrod for I had not the least knowledge of what might descend

Hm said Strickland and his voice rolled and rumbled in the roof
Theres room for another set of rooms up here and by Jove some one
is occupying em

Snakes I said down below

No Its a buffalo Hand me up the two first joints of a masheer rod
and Ill prod it Its lying on the main beam

I handed up the rod

What a nest for owls and serpents No wonder the snakes live here
said Strickland climbing further into the roof I could see his elbow
thrusting with the rod Come out of that whoever you are Look out
Heads below there Its tottering

I saw the ceilingcloth nearly in the centre of the room bag with a
shape that was pressing it downward and downward toward the lighted
lamps on the table I snatched a lamp out of danger and stood back Then
the cloth ripped out from the walls tore split swayed and shot down
upon the table something that I dared not look at till Strickland had
slid down the ladder and was standing by my side

He did not say much being a man of few words but he picked up the
loose end of the tablecloth and threw it over the thing on the table

It strikes me said he pulling down the lamp our friend Imray has
come back Oh you would would you

There was a movement under the cloth and a little snake wriggled out
to be backbroken by the butt of the masheer rod I was sufficiently
sick to make no remarks worth recording

Strickland meditated and helped himself to drinks liberally The thing
under the cloth made no more signs of life

Is it Imray I said

Strickland turned back the cloth for a moment and looked It is Imray
he said and his throat is cut from ear to ear

Then we spoke both together and to ourselves

Thats why he whispered about the house

Tietjens in the garden began to bay furiously A little later her
great nose heaved upon the diningroom door

She sniffed and was still The broken and tattered ceilingcloth hung
down almost to the level of the table and there was hardly room to move
away from the discovery

Then Tietjens came in and sat down her teeth bared and her forepaws
planted She looked at Strickland

Its bad business old lady said he Men dont go up into the roofs
of their bungalows to die and they dont fasten up the ceilingcloth
behind em Lets think it out

Lets think it out somewhere else I said

Excellent idea Turn the lamps out Well get into my room

I did not turn the lamps out I went into Stricklands room first and
allowed him to make the darkness Then he followed me and we lighted
tobacco and thought Strickland did the thinking I smoked furiously
because I was afraid

Imray is back said Strickland The question is who killed Imray
Dont talkI have a notion of my own When I took this bungalow I took
most of Imrays servants Imray was guileless and inoffensive wasnt
he

I agreed though the heap under the cloth looked neither one thing nor
the other

If I call the servants they will stand fast in a crowd and lie like
Aryans What do you suggest

Call em in one by one I said

Theyll run away and give the news to all their fellows said
Strickland

We must segregate em Do you suppose your servant knows anything about
it

He may for aught I know but I dont think its likely He has only
been here two or three days

Whats your notion I asked

I cant quite tell How the dickens did the man get the wrong side of
the ceilingcloth

There was a heavy coughing outside Stricklands bedroom door This
showed that Bahadur Khan his bodyservant had waked from sleep and
wished to put Strickland to bed

Come in said Strickland It is a very warm night isnt it

Bahadur Khan a great greenturbaned sixfoot Mohammedan said that it
was a very warm night but that there was more rain pending which by
his honors favor would bring relief to the country

It will be so if God pleases said Strickland tugging off his hoots
It is in my mind Bahadur Khan that I have worked thee remorselessly
for many daysever since that time when thou first came into my
service What time was that

Has the heavenborn forgotten It was when Imray Sahib went secretly
to Europe without warning given and Ieven Icame into the honored
service of the protector of the poor

And Imray Sahib went to Europe

It is so said among the servants

And thou wilt take service with him when he returns

Assuredly sahib He was a good master and cherished his dependents

That is true I am very tired but I can go buckshooting tomorrow
Give me the little rifle that I use for black buck it is in the case
yonder

The man stooped over the case banded barrels stock and foreend to
Strickland who fitted them together Yawning dolefully then he reached
down to the guncase took a solid drawn cartridge and slipped it into
the breech of the 360 express

And Imray Sahib has gone to Europe secretly That is very strange
Bahadur Khan is it not

What do I know of the ways of the white man heavenborn

Very little truly But thou shalt know more It has reached me that
Imray Sahib has returned from his so long journeyings and that even now
he lies in the next room waiting his servant

Sahib

The lamplight slid along the barrels of the rifle as they leveled
themselves against Bahadur Khans broad breast

Go then and look said Strickland Take a lamp Thy master is
tired and he waits Go

The man picked up a lamp and went into the diningroom Strickland
following and almost pushing him with the muzzle of the rifle He
looked for a moment at the black depths behind the ceilingcloth at the
carcass of the mangled snake under foot and last a grey glaze setting
on his face at the thing under the tablecloth

Hast thou seen said Strickland after a pause

I have seen I am clay in the white mans hands What does the presence
do

Hang thee within a month What else

For killing him Nay sahib consider Walking among us his servants
he cast his eyes upon my child who was four years old Him he
bewitched and in ten days he died of the fever My child

What said Imray Sahib

He said he was a handsome child and patted him on the head wherefore
my child died Wherefore I killed Imray Sahib in the twilight when
he came back from office and was sleeping The heavenborn knows all
things I am the servant of the heavenborn

Strickland looked at me above the rifle and said in the vernacular
Thou art witness to this saying He has killed

Bahadur Khan stood ashen grey in the light of the one lamp The need for
justification came upon him very swiftly

I am trapped he said but the offence was that mans He cast an
evil eye upon my child and I killed and hid him Only such as are
served by devils he glared at Tietjens crouched stolidly before him
only such could know what I did

It was clever But thou shouldst have lashed him to the beam with a
rope Now thou thyself wilt hang by a rope Orderly

A drowsy policeman answered Stricklands call He was followed by
another and Tietjens sat still

Take him to the station said Strickland There is a case toward

Do I hang then said Bahadur Khan making no attempt to escape and
keeping his eyes on the ground

If the sun shines or the water runs thou wilt hang said Strickland
Bahadur Khan stepped back one pace quivered and stood still The two
policemen waited further orders

Go said Strickland

Nay but I go very swiftly said Bahadur Khan Look I am even now a
dead man

He lifted his foot and to the little toe there clung the head of the
halfkilled snake firm fixed in the agony of death

I come of landholding stock said Bahadur Khan rocking where
he stood It were a disgrace for me to go to the public scaffold
therefore I take this way Be it remembered that the sahibs shirts are
correctly enumerated and that there is an extra piece of soap in his
washbasin My child was bewitched and I slew the wizard Why should you
seek to slay me My honor is saved andandI die

At the end of an hour he died as they die who are bitten by the little
kariat and the policeman bore him and the thing under the tablecloth
to their appointed places They were needed to make clear the
disappearance of Imray

This said Strickland very calmly as he climbed into bed is called
the nineteenth century Did you hear what that man said

I heard I answered Imray made a mistake

Simply and solely through not knowing the nature and coincidence of a
little seasonal fever Bahadur Khan has been with him for four years

I shuddered My own servant had been with me for exactly that length of
time When I went over to my own room I found him waiting impassive as
the copper head on a penny to pull off my boots

What has befallen Bahadur Khan said I

He was bitten by a snake and died the rest the sahib knows was the
answer

And how much of the matter hast thou known

As much as might be gathered from one coming in the twilight to seek
satisfaction Gently sahib Let me pull off those boots

I had just settled to the sleep of exhaustion when I heard Strickland
shouting from his side of the house

Tietjens has come back to her room

And so she had The great deerhound was couched on her own bedstead
on her own blanket and in the next room the idle empty ceilingcloth
wagged lightheartedly as it flailed on the table




MOTI GUJMUTINEER

ONCE upon a time there was a coffeeplanter in India who wished to clear
some forest land for coffeeplanting When he had cut down all the
trees and burned the underwood the stumps still remained Dynamite is
expensive and slow fire slow The happy medium for stumpclearing is the
lord of all beasts who is the elephant He will either push the stump
out of the ground with his tusks if he has any or drag it out with
ropes The planter therefore hired elephants by ones and twos and
threes and fell to work The very best of all the elephants belonged to
the very worst of all the drivers or mahouts and this superior beasts
name was Moti Guj He was the absolute property of his mahout which
would never have been the case under native rule for Moti Guj was a
creature to be desired by kings and his name being translated meant
the Pearl Elephant Because the British government was in the land
Deesa the mahout enjoyed his property undisturbed He was dissipated
When he had made much money through the strength of his elephant he
would get extremely drunk and give Moti Guj a beating with a tentpeg
over the tender nails of the forefeet Moti Guj never trampled the life
out of Deesa on these occasions for he knew that after the beating was
over Deesa would embrace his trunk and weep and call him his love and
his life and the liver of his soul and give him some liquor Moti
Guj was very fond of liquorarrack for choice though he would drink
palmtree toddy if nothing better offered Then Deesa would go to sleep
between Moti Gujs forefeet and as Deesa generally chose the middle of
the public road and as Moti Guj mounted guard over him and would not
permit horse foot or cart to pass by traffic was congested till Deesa
saw fit to wake up

There was no sleeping in the daytime on the planters clearing the
wages were too high to risk Deesa sat on Moti Gujs neck and gave him
orders while Moti Guj rooted up the stumpsfor he owned a magnificent
pair of tusks or pulled at the end of a ropefor he had a magnificent
pair of shoulderswhile Deesa kicked him behind the ears and said he
was the king of elephants At evening time Moti Guj would wash down his
three hundred pounds weight of green food with a quart of arrack and
Deesa would take a share and sing songs between Moti Gujs legs till it
was time to go to bed Once a week Deesa led Moti Guj down to the river
and Moti Gui lay on his side luxuriously in the shallows while Deesa
went over him with a coir swab and a brick Moti Guj never mistook the
pounding blow of the latter for the smack of the former that warned him
to get up and turn over on the other side Then Deesa would look at his
feet and examine his eyes and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears in
case of sores or budding ophthalmia After inspection the two would come
up with a song from the sea Moti Guj all black and shining waving a
torn tree branch twelve feet long in his trunk and Deesa knotting up
his own long wet hair

It was a peaceful wellpaid life till Deesa felt the return of the
desire to drink deep He wished for an orgy The little draughts that
led nowhere were taking the manhood out of him

He went to the planter and My mothers dead said he weeping

She died on the last plantation two months ago and she died once
before that when you were working for me last year said the planter
who knew something of the ways of nativedom

Then its my aunt and she was just the same as a mother to me said
Deesa weeping more than ever She has left eighteen small children
entirely without bread and it is I who must fill their little
stomachs said Deesa beating his head on the floor

Who brought the news said the planter

The post said Deesa

There hasnt been a post here for the past week Get back to your
lines

A devastating sickness has fallen on my village and all my wives are
dying yelled Deesa really in tears this time

Call Chihun who comes from Deesas village said the planter
Chihun has this man got a wife

He said Chihun No Not a woman of our village would look at him
Theyd sooner marry the elephant

Chihun snorted Deesa wept and bellowed

You will get into a difficulty in a minute said the planter Go back
to your work

Now I will speak Heavens truth gulped Deesa with an inspiration
I havent been drunk for two months I desire to depart in order to get
properly drunk afar off and distant from this heavenly plantation Thus
I shall cause no trouble

A flickering smile crossed the planters face Deesa said he youve
spoken the truth and Id give you leave on the spot if anything could
be done with Moti Guj while youre away You know that he will only obey
your orders

May the light of the heavens live forty thousand years I shall be
absent but ten little days After that upon my faith and honor and
soul I return As to the inconsiderable interval have I the gracious
permission of the heavenborn to call up Moti Guj

Permission was granted and in answer of Deesas shrill yell the mighty
tusker swung out of the shade of a clump of trees where he had been
squirting dust over himself till his master should return

Light of my heart protector of the drunken mountain of might give
ear said Deesa standing in front of him

Moti Guj gave ear and saluted with his trunk I am going away said
Deesa

Moti Gujs eyes twinkled He liked jaunts as well as his master One
could snatch all manner of nice things from the roadside then

But you you fussy old pig must stay behind and work

The twinkle died out as Moti Guj tried to look delighted He hated
stumphauling on the plantation It hurt his teeth

I shall be gone for ten days oh delectable one Hold up your near
forefoot and Ill impress the fact upon it warty toad of a dried
mudpuddle Deesa took a tentpeg and banged Moti Guj ten times on the
nails Moti Guj grunted and shuffled from foot to foot

Ten days said Deesa you will work and haul and root the trees as
Chihun here shall order you Take up Chihun and set him on your neck
Moti Guj curled the tip of his trunk Chihun put his foot there and
was swung on to the neck Deesa handed Chihun the heavy ankusthe iron
elephant goad

Chihun thumped Moti Gujs bald head as a paver thumps a curbstone

Moti Guj trumpeted

Be still hog of the backwoods Chihuns your mahout for ten days And
now bid me goodbye beast after mine own heart Oh my lord my king
Jewel of all created elephants lily of the herd preserve your honored
health be virtuous Adieu

Moti Guj lapped his trunk round Deesa and swung him into the air twice
That was his way of bidding him goodbye

Hell work now said Deesa to the planter Have I leave to go

The planter nodded and Deesa dived into the woods Moti Guj went back
to haul stumps

Chihun was very kind to him but he felt unhappy and forlorn for all
that Chihun gave him a ball of spices and tickled him under the chin
and Chihuns little baby cooed to him after work was over and Chihuns
wife called him a darling but Moti Guj was a bachelor by instinct as
Deesa was He did not understand the domestic emotions He wanted the
light of his universe back againthe drink and the drunken slumber the
savage beatings and the savage caresses

None the less he worked well and the planter wondered Deesa had
wandered along the roads till he met a marriage procession of his own
caste and drinking dancing and tippling had drifted with it past
all knowledge of the lapse of time

The morning of the eleventh day dawned and there returned no Deesa
Moti Guj was loosed from his ropes for the daily stint He swung clear
looked round shrugged his shoulders and began to walk away as one
having business elsewhere

Hi ho Come back you shouted Chihun Come back and put me on your
neck misborn mountain Return splendor of the hillsides Adornment of
all India heave to or Ill bang every toe off your forefoot

Moti Guj gurgled gently but did not obey Chihun ran after him with a
rope and caught him up Moti Guj put his ears forward and Chihun knew
what that meant though he tried to carry it off with high words

None of your nonsense with me said he To your pickets devilson

Hrrump said Moti Guj and that was allthat and the forebent ears

Moti Guj put his hands in his pockets chewed a branch for a toothpick
and strolled about the clearing making fun of the other elephants who
had just set to work

Chihun reported the state of affairs to the planter who came out with
a dogwhip and cracked it furiously Moti Guj paid the white man
the compliment of charging him nearly a quarter of a mile across the
clearing and Hrrumphing him into his veranda Then he stood outside
the house chuckling to himself and shaking all over with the fun of it
as an elephant will

Well thrash him said the planter He shall have the finest
thrashing ever elephant received Give Kala Nag and Nazim twelve foot of
chain apiece and tell them to lay on twenty

Kala Nagwhich means Black Snakeand Nazim were two of the biggest
elephants in the lines and one of their duties was to administer the
graver punishment since no man can beat an elephant properly

They took the whippingchains and rattled them in their trunks as they
sidled up to Moti Guj meaning to hustle him between them Moti Guj had
never in all his life of thirtynine years been whipped and he did
not intend to begin a new experience So he waited waving his head from
right to left and measuring the precise spot in Kala Nags fat side
where a blunt tusk could sink deepest Kala Nag had no tusks the chain
was the badge of his authority but for all that he swung wide of Moti
Guj at the last minute and tried to appear as if he had brought the
chain out for amusement Nazim turned round and went home early He did
not feel fighting fit that morning and so Moti Guj was left standing
alone with his ears cocked

That decided the planter to argue no more and Moti Guj rolled back to
his amateur inspection of the clearing An elephant who will not work
and is not tied up is about as manageable as an eightyoneton gun loose
in a heavy seaway He slapped old friends on the back and asked them if
the stumps were coming away easily he talked nonsense concerning
labor and the inalienable rights of elephants to a long nooning and
wandering to and fro he thoroughly demoralized the garden till sundown
when he returned to his picket for food

If you wont work you shant eat said Chihun angrily Youre a
wild elephant and no educated animal at all Go back to your jungle

Chihuns little brown baby was rolling on the floor of the hut and
stretching out its fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway Moti Guj
knew well that it was the dearest thing on earth to Chihun He swung out
his trunk with a fascinating crook at the end and the brown baby threw
itself shouting upon it Moti Guj made fast and pulled up till the
brown baby was crowing in the air twelve feet above his fathers head

Great Lord said Chihun Flour cakes of the best twelve in number
two feet across and soaked in rum shall be yours on the instant and
two hundred pounds weight of freshcut young sugarcane therewith Deign
only to put down safely that insignificant brat who is my heart and my
life to me

Moti Guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his forefeet that
could have knocked into toothpicks all Chihuns hut and waited for his
food He ate it and the brown baby crawled away Moti Guj dozed and
thought of Deesa One of many mysteries connected with the elephant is
that his huge body needs less sleep than anything else that lives Four
or five hours in the night sufficetwo just before midnight lying down
on one side two just after one oclock lying down on the other The
rest of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting and long
grumbling soliloquies

At midnight therefore Moti Guj strode out of his pickets for a
thought had come to him that Deesa might be lying drunk somewhere in
the dark forest with none to look after him So all that night he chased
through the undergrowth blowing and trumpeting and shaking his ears He
went down to the river and blared across the shallows where Deesa used
to wash him but there was no answer He could not find Deesa but he
disturbed all the other elephants in the lines and nearly frightened to
death some gypsies in the woods

At dawn Deesa returned to the plantation He had been very drunk in
deed and he expected to get into trouble for outstaying his leave He
drew a long breath when he saw that the bungalow and the plantation
were still uninjured for he knew something of Moti Gujs temper and
reported himself with many lies and salaams Moti Guj had gone to his
pickets for breakfast The night exercise had made him hungry

Call up your beast said the planter and Deesa shouted in the
mysterious elephant language that some mahouts believe came from China
at the birth of the world when elephants and not men were masters Moti
Guj heard and came Elephants do not gallop They move from places at
varying rates of speed If an elephant wished to catch an express train
he could not gallop but he could catch the train So Moti Guj was at
the planters door almost before Chihun noticed that he had left his
pickets He fell into Deesas arms trumpeting with joy and the man and
beast wept and slobbered over each other and handled each other from
head to heel to see that no harm had befallen

Now we will get to work said Deesa Lift me up my son and my joy

Moti Guj swung him up and the two went to the coffeeclearing to look
for difficult stumps

The planter was too astonished to be very angry

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
