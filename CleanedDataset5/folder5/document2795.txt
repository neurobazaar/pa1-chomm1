PART I THE COMING OF THE TAILLESS TYKE



Chapter I THE GRAY DOG


THE sun stared brazenly down on a gray farmhouse lying long and low
in the shadow of the Muir Pike on the ruins of peeltower and barmkyn
relics of the time of raids it looked on ranges of whitewashed
outbuildings on a goodly array of darkthatched ricks

In the stackyard behind the lengthy range of stables two men were
thatching One lay sprawling on the crest of the rick the other stood
perched on a ladder at a lower level

The latter small old with shrewd nutbrown countenance was Tammas
Thornton who had served the Moores of Kenmuir for more than half a
century The other on top of the stack wrapped apparently in gloomy
meditation was Saml Todd A solid Dalesman he with huge hands and
hairy arms about his face an uncomely aureole of stiff red hair and
on his features deepseated an expression of resolute melancholy

Ay the Gray Dogs bless em the old man was saying Yo canna beat
em not nohow Known em ony time this sixty year I have and niver
knew a bad un yet Not as I say mind ye as any on em cooms up to Rex
son o Rally Ah he was a one was Rex Wes never won Cup since his
day

Nor niver shall agin yo may depend said the other gloomily

Tammas clucked irritably

Glong Sam Todd he cried Yo niver happy onless yo making
yoself miserble I niver see sich a chap Niver win agin Why oor
young Bob hell mak a right un I tell yo and I should know Not as
what hell touch Rex son o Rally mark ye Im niver saying so Saml
Todd Ah he was a one was Rex I could tell yo a tale or two o Rex
I mind me hoo

The big man interposed hurriedly

Ive heard it afore Tammas I welly ave he said

Tammas paused and looked angrily up

Yove heard it afore have yo Saml Todd he asked sharply And
what have yo heard afore

Yo stories owd ladyo stories o Rex son o Rally

Which on em

All on em Tammas all on emmony a time Im fair sick on em
Tammas I welly am he pleaded

The old man gasped He brought down his mallet with a vicious smack

Ill niver tell yo a tale agin Saml Todd not if yo was to go on
yo bended knees fort Nay it baint no manner o use talkin Niver
agin says I

I niver askt yo declared honest Saml

Nor it wouldna ha bin no manner o use if yo had said the other
viciously Ill niver tell yo a tale agin if I was to live to be a
hunderd

Yoll not live to be a hunderd Tammas Thornton nor near it said
Saml brutally

Ill live as long as some I warrant the old man replied with spirit
Ill live to see Cup back i Kenmuir as I said afore

If yo do the other declared with emphasis Saml Todd niver spake a
true word Nay nay lad yore owd yore wambly your times near run
or Im the more mistook

For mussys sake hold yo tongue Saml Todd Its clackclack all
day The old man broke off suddenly and buckled to his work with
suspicious vigor Mak a show yo bin workin lad he whispered
Heres Master and oor Bob

As he spoke a tall gaitered man with weatherbeaten face strong lean
austere and the bluegray eyes of the hillcountry came striding into
the yard And trotting soberly at his heels with the gravest saddest
eyes ever you saw a sheepdog puppy

A rare dark gray he was his long coat dashed here and there with
lighter touches like a stormy sea moonlit Upon his chest an escutcheon
of purest white and the dome of his head showered as it were with
a sprinkling of snow Perfectly compact utterly lithe inimitably
graceful with his airyfairy action a gentleman every inch you could
not help but stare at himOwd Bob o Kenmuir

At the foot of the ladder the two stopped And the young dog placing
his forepaws on a lower rung looked up slowly waving his silvery
brush

A proper Gray Dog mused Tammas gazing down into the dark face
beneath him Small yet big light to get about on backs o his sheep
yet not too light Wi a coat hard atop to keep oot Daleland weather
soft as sealskin beneath And wi them sorrerful eyes on him as niver
goes but wi a good un Amaist he minds me o Rex son o Rally

Oh dear Oh dear groaned Saml But the old man heard him not

Did Enry Farewether tell yo hoo he acted this mornin Master he
inquired addressing the man at the foot of the ladder

Nay said the other his stern eyes lighting

Why twas this way it seems Tammas continued Young bull gets
isseif loose somegate and marches oot into yard oerturns milkpail
and prods owd pigs i ribs And as he stands lookin about un thinking
what he shall be up to next oor Bob sees un An what yo doin here
Mr Bull he seems to say cockin his ears and trottin up gaylike
Wi that bull bloats fit to bust isseif lashes wis tail waggles his
head and gets agate o chargin im But Bob leaps oot o way quick
as lightnin yet cool as butter and when hes done his foolin drives un
back agin

Who seed all this interposed Saml sceptically

Enry Farewether from the loft So there Fatead Tammas replied and
continued his tale So they goes on bull chargin and Bob drivin
un back and back hoppin in and oot agin quiet as a cowcumber yet
determined At last Mr Bull sees its no manner o use that gate so he
turns rares up and tries to jump wall Nary a bit Young dog jumps
in on un and nips him by tail Wi that bull tumbles down in a hurry
turns wi a kind o groan and marches back into stall Bob after un
And then dang methe old man beat the ladder as he loosed off this
last titbitif he doesna sit isseif i door like a sentrynel till
Enry Farewether coom up Hoos that for a tyke not yet a year

Even Saml Todd was moved by the tale

Well done oor Bob he cried

Good lad said the Master laying a hand on the dark head at his
knee

Yo may well say that cried Tammas in a kind of ecstasy A proper
Gray Dog I tell yo Wi the brains of a man and the way of a woman
Ah yo canna beat em nohow the Gray Dogs o Kenmuir

The patter of cheery feet rang out on the plankbridge over the stream
below them Tammas glanced round

Heres David he said Late this mornin he be

A fairhaired boy came spurring up the slope his face all aglow with
the speed of his running Straightway the young dog dashed off to
meet him with a fiery speed his sober gait belied The two raced back
together into the yard

Poor lad said Saml gloomily regarding the newcomer

Poor heart muttered Tammas While the Masters face softened visibly
Yet there looked little to pity in this jolly rocking lad with the
tousle of light hair and fresh rosy countenance

Gmornin Mister Moore Mornn Tammas Mornn Saml he panted as
he passed and ran on through the haycarpeted yard round the corner of
the stable and into the house

In the kitchen a long room with redtiled floor and latticed windows
a woman whiteaproned and frailfaced was bustling about her morning
business To her skirts clung a sturdy barelegged boy while at
the oak table in the centre of the room a girl with brown eyes and
straggling hair was seated before a basin of bread and milk

So yove coom at last David the woman cried as the boy entered
and bending greeted him with a tender motherly salutation which he
returned as affectionately I welly thowt yod forgot us this mornin
Noo sit you doon beside oor Maggie And soon he too was engaged in a
task twin to the girls

The two children munched away in silence the little barelegged boy
watching them the while critically Irritated by this prolonged stare
David at length turned on him

Weel little Andrew he said speaking in that paternal fashion in
which one small boy loves to address another Weel ma little lad
yom coomin along gradely He leant back in his chair the better to
criticise his subject But Andrew like all the Moores slow of speech
preserved a stolid silence sucking a chubby thumb and regarding his
patron a thought cynically

David resented the expression on the boys countenance and half rose to
his feet

Yo put another face on yo Andrew Moore he cried threateningly or
Ill put it for yo

Maggie however interposed opportunely

Did yo feyther beat yo last night she inquired in a low voice and
there was a shade of anxiety in the soft brown eyes

Nay the boy answered he was agoin to but he never did Drunk
he added in explanation

What was he goin to beat yo for David asked Mrs Moore

What for Why for the fun otto see me squiggle the boy replied
and laughed bitterly

Yo shouldna speak so o your dad David reproved the other as
severely as was in her nature

Dad a fine dad Id dad him an Id the chance the boy muttered
beneath his breath Then to turn the conversation

Us should be startin Maggie he said and going to the door Bob
Owd Bob lad Art coomin along he called

The gray dog came springing up like an antelope and the three started
off for school together

Mrs Moore stood in the doorway holding Andrew by the hand and watched
the departing trio

Tis a pretty pair Master surely she said softly to her husband
who came up at the moment

Ay hell be a fine lad if his fetherll let him the tall man
answered

Tis a shame Mr MAdam should lead him such a life the woman
continued indignantly She laid a hand on her husbands arm and looked
up at him coaxingly

Could yo not say summat to un Master think ee Happen hed tend
to you she pleaded For Mrs Moore imagined that there could be no one
but would gladly heed what James Moore Master of Kenmuir might say
to him Hes not a bad un at bottom I do believe she continued He
never took on so till his missus died Eh but he was main fond o her

Her husband shook his head Nay mother he said Twould nob but
mak it worse for t lad MAdamd listen to no one let alone me And
indeed he was right for the tenant of the Grange made no secret of his
animosity for his straightgoing straightspeaking neighbor

     

Owd Bob in the mean time had escorted the children to the larchcopse
bordering on the lane which leads to the village Now he crept
stealthily back to the yard and established himself behind the
waterbutt

How he played and how he laughed how he teased old Whitecap till that
gray gander all but expired of apoplexy and impotence how he ran the
roan bullcalf and aroused the bitter wrath of a portly sow mother of
many is of no account

At last in the midst of his merry mischiefmaking a stern voice
arrested him

Bob lad I see tis time we larned you yo letters

So the business of life began for that dog of whom the simple
farmerfolk of the Daleland still love to talkBob son of Battle
last of the Gray Dogs of Kenmuir




Chapter II A SON OF HAGAR


It is a lonely country that about the Wastreldale

Parson Leggy Hornbut will tell you that his is the smallest church in
the biggest parish north of the Derwent and that his cure numbers more
square miles than parishioners Of fells and ghylls it consists of
becks and lakes with here a scattered hamlet and there a solitary hill
sheepfarm It is a country in which sheep are paramount and every
other Dalesman is engaged in that profession which is as old as Abel
And the talk of the men of the land is of wethers and gimmers of
tuphoggs ewe tegs in wool and other things which are but fearsome
names to you and me and always of the doings or misdoings the
intelligence or stupidity of their adjutants the sheepdogs

Of all the Daleland the country from the Black Water to Grammoch Pike
is the wildest Above the tiny stonebuilt village of Wastreldale the
Muir Pike nods its massive head Westward the desolate Mere Marches
from which the Sylvesters great estate derives its name reach away in
mile on mile of sheep infested windswept moorland On the far side of
the Marches is that twin dale where flows the gentle Silver Lea And it
is there in the paddocks at the back of the Dalesmans Daughter that
in the late summer months the famous sheepdog Trials of the North are
held There that the battle for the Dale Cup the worldknown Shepherds
Trophy is fought out

Past the little inn leads the turnpike road to the marketcentre of the
districtGrammochtown At the bottom of the paddocks at the back of
the inn winds the Silver Lea Just there a plank bridge crosses the
stream and beyond the Murk Muir Pass crawls up the sheer side of the
Scaur on to the Mere Marches

At the head of the Pass before it debouches on to those lonely
sheepwalks which divide the two dales is that hollow shuddering with
gloomy possibilities aptly called the Devils Bowl In its centre the
Lone Tarn weirdly suggestive pool lifts its still face to the sky It
was beside that black frozen water across whose cold surface the storm
was swirling in white snowwraiths that many many years ago not in
this century old Andrew Moore came upon the mother of the Gray Dogs of
Kenmuir

In the North every one who has heard of the Muir Pikeand who has
nothas heard of the Gray Dogs of Kenmuir every one who has heard
of the Shepherds Trophyand who has notknows their fame In that
country of good dogs and jealous masters the pride of place has long
been held unchallenged Whatever line may claim to follow the Gray Dogs
always lead the van And there is a saying in the land Faithfu as the
Moores and their tykes

     

On the top dresser to the right of the fireplace in the kitchen
of Kenmuir lies the family Bible At the end you will find a loose
sheetthe pedigree of the Gray Dogs at the beginning pasted on the
inside an almost similar sheet long since yellow with agethe family
register of the Moores of Kenmuir

Running your eye down the loose leaf once twice and again it will be
caught by a small red cross beneath a name and under the cross the one
word Cup Lastly opposite the name of Rex son of Rally are two of
those proud telltale marks The cup referred to is the renowned Dale
CupChampion Challenge Dale Cup open to the world Had Rex won it but
once again the Shepherds Trophy which many men have lived to win and
died still striving after would have come to rest forever in the little
gray house below the Pike

It was not to be however Comparing the two sheets you read beneath
the dogs name a date and a pathetic legend and on the other sheet
written in his sons boyish hand beneath the name of Andrew Moore the
same date and the same legend

From that day James Moore then but a boy was master of Kenmuir

So past Grip and Rex and Rally and a hundred others until at the foot
of the page you come to that last nameBob son of Battle

     

From the very first the young dog took to his work in a manner to
amaze even James Moore For a while he watched his mother Meg at her
business and with that seemed to have mastered the essentials of sheep
tactics

Rarely had such fiery elan been seen on the sides of the Pike and with
it the young dog combined a strange sobriety an admirable patience
that justified indeed the epithet Owd Silent he worked and
resolute and even in those days had that famous trick of coaxing the
sheep to do his wishesblending in short as Tammas put it the
brains of a man with the way of a woman

Parson Leggy who was reckoned the best judge of a sheep or sheepdog
twixt Tyne and Tweed summed him up in the one word Genius And James
Moore himself cautious man was more than pleased

In the village the Dalesmen who took a personal pride in the Gray Dogs
of Kenmuir began to nod sage heads when oor Bob was mentioned Jim
Mason the postman whose word went as far with the villagers as Parson
Leggys with the gentry reckoned hed never seen a young un as so took
his fancy

That winter it grew quite the recognized thing when they had gathered
of a night round the fire in the Sylvester Arms with Tammas in the
centre old Jonas Maddox on his right Rob Saunderson of the Holt on the
left and the others radiating away toward the sides for some one to
begin with

Well and what o oor Bob Mr Thornton

To which Tammas would always make reply

Oh yo ask Saml there Hell tell yo bettern me and would
forthwith plunge himself into a yarn

And the way in which as the story proceeded Tupper of Swinsthwaite
winked at Ned Hoppin of Fellsgarth and Long Kirby the smith poked Jem
Burton the publican in the ribs and Sexton Ross said Ma word lad
spoke more eloquently than many words

One man only never joined in the chorus of admiration Sitting always
alone in the background little MAdam would listen with an incredulous
grin on his sallow face

Oh ma certes The devils in the dog Its no cannie ava he would
continually exclaim as Tammas told his tale

     

In the Daleland you rarely see a strangers face Wandering in the wild
country about the twin dales at the time of this story you might have
met Parson Leggy striding along with a couple of varmint terriers at
his heels and young Cyril Gilbraith whom he was teaching to tie flies
and fear God beside him or Jim Mason postman by profession poacher
by predilection honest man and sportsman by nature hurrying along with
the mailbags on his shoulder a rabbit in his pocket and the faithful
Betsy a yard behind Besides these you might have hit upon a quiet
shepherd and a wisefaced dog Squire Sylvester going his rounds upon
a sturdy cob or had you been lucky sweet Lady Eleanour bent upon some
errand of mercy to one of the many tenants

It was while the Squires lady was driving through the village on a
visit to Tammass slobbering grandsonit was shortly after Billy
Thorntons advent into the worldthat little MAdam standing in the
door of the Sylvester Arms with a twig in his mouth and a sneer fading
from his lips made his evermemorable remark

Sall he said speaking in low earnest voice tis a muckle wumman

 Note It was this visit which figured in the Grammochtown
 _Argus_ local and radical under the heading of Alleged
 Wholesale Corruption by Tory Agents And that is why on
 the following market day Herbert Trotter journalist
 erstwhile gentleman and Secretary of the Dale Trials found
 himself trying to swim in the public horsetrough

What What be sayin mon cried old Jonas startled out of his usual
apathy

MAdam turned sharply on the old man

I said the wumman wears a muckle hat he snapped

Blotted out as it was the observation still remainsa tribute of
honest admiration Doubtless the Recording Angel did not pass it by
That one statement anent the gentle lady of the manor is the only
personal remark ever credited to little MAdam not born of malice and
all uncharitableness And that is why it is ever memorable

The little Scotsman with the sardonic face had been the tenant of the
Grange these many years yet he had never grown acclimatized to the
land of the Southron With his shrivelled body and weakly legs he looked
among the sturdy straightlimbed sons of the hillcountry like some
brown wrinkled leaf holding its place midst a galaxy of green And as
he differed from them physically so he did morally

He neither understood them nor attempted to The Northcountry character
was an unsolved mystery to him and that after ten years study
Onehalf o what ye say they doot and they let ye see it tither half
they disbelieve and they tell ye so he once said And that explained
his attitude toward them and consequently theirs toward him

He stood entirely alone a son of Hagar mocking His sharp ill tongue
was rarely still and always bitter There was hardly a man in the land
from Langholm How to the marketcross in Grammochtown but had at
one time known its sting endured it in silencefor they are slow of
speech these men of the fells and meresand was nursing his resentment
till a day should bring that chance which always comes And when at
the Sylvester Arms on one of those rare occasions when MAdam was not
present Tammas summed up the little man in that historic phrase of his
When hes drunk hes wilent and when he baint hes wicious there
was an applause to gratify the blase heart of even Tammas Thornton

Yet it had not been till his wifes death that the little man had
allowed loose rein to his illnature With her firmly gentle hand no
longer on the tiller of his life it burst into fresh being And alone
in the world with David the whole venom of his vicious temperament was
ever directed against the boys head It was as though he saw in his
fairhaired son the unconscious cause of his everliving sorrow All
the more strange this seeing that during her life the boy had been
to poor Flora MAdam as her hearts core And the lad was growing up the
very antithesis of his father Big and hearty with never an ache or ill
in the whole of his sturdy young body of frank open countenance while
even his speech was slow and burring like any Dalebred boys And
the fact of it all and that the lad was palpably more Englishman than
Scotay and gloried in itexasperated the little man a patriot
before everything to blows While on top of it David evinced an
amazing pertness fit to have tried a better man than Adam MAdam

On the death of his wife kindly Elizabeth Moore had more than once
offered such help to the lonely little man as a woman only can give in
a house that knows no mistress On the last of these occasions after
crossing the Stony Bottom which divides the two farms and toiling up
the hill to the Grange she had met MAdam in the door

Yo maun let me put yo bit things straight for yo mister she had
said shyly for she feared the little man

Thank ye Mrs Moore he had answered with the sour smile the Dalesmen
knew so well but ye maun think Im a waefu cripple And there he had
stood grinning sardonically opposing his small bulk in the very centre
of the door

Mrs Moore had turned down the hill abashed and hurt at the reception
of her offer and her husband proud to a fault had forbidden her
to repeat it Nevertheless her motherly heart went out in a great
tenderness for the little orphan David She knew well the desolateness
of his life his fathers aversion from him and its inevitable
consequences

It became an institution for the boy to call every morning at Kenmuir
and trot off to the village school with Maggie Moore And soon the lad
came to look on Kenmuir as his true home and James and Elizabeth Moore
as his real parents His greatest happiness was to be away from the
Grange And the ferreteyed little man there noted the fact bitterly
resented it and vented his illhumor accordingly

It was this as he deemed it uncalledfor trespassing on his authority
which was the chief cause of his animosity against James Moore The
Master of Kenmuir it was at whom he was aiming when he remarked one
day at the Arms Masel I aye prefaire the good man who does no go to
church to the bad man who does But then as ye say Mr Burton Im
peculiar

The little mans treatment of David exaggerated as it was by eager
credulity became at length such a scandal to the Dale that Parson Leggy
determined to bring him to task on the matter

Now MAdam was the parsons pet antipathy The bluff old minister with
his brusque manner and big heart would have no truck with the man who
never went to church was perpetually in liquor and never spoke good of
his neighbors Yet he entered upon the interview fully resolved not to
be betrayed into an unworthy expression of feeling rather to appeal to
the little mans better nature

The conversation had not been in progress two minutes however before
he knew that where he had meant to be calmly persuasive he was fast
become hotly abusive

You Mr Hornbut wi James Moore to help ye look after the lads
soul Ill see to his body the little man was saying

The parsons thick gray eyebrows lowered threateningly over his eyes

You ought to be ashamed of yourself to talk like that Which dyou
think the more important soul or body Oughtnt you his father to be
the very first to care for the boys soul If not who should Answer
me sir

The little man stood smirking and sucking his eternal twig entirely
unmoved by the others heat

Yere right Mr Hornbut as ye aye are But my argiment is this that
I get at his soul best through his leetle carcase

The honest parson brought down his stick with an angry thud

MAdam youre a brutea brute he shouted At which outburst the
little man was seized with a spasm of silent merriment

A fond dad first a brute afterward aiblinshe he Ah Mr Hornbut
ye ford me vast diversion ye do indeed my loved my honored
muchrespected friend

If you paid as much heed to your boys welfare as you do to the bad
poetry of that profligate ploughman

An angry gleam shot into the others eyes Dye ken what blasphemy is
Mr Hornbut he asked shouldering a pace forward

For the first time in the dispute the parson thought he was about to
score a point and was calm accordingly

I should do I fancy Ive a specimen of the breed before me now And
dyou know what impertinence is

I should do I fancy IveI awd say its what gentlemen aften are
unless their mammies whipped em as lads

For a moment the parson looked as if about to seize his opponent and
shake him

MAdam he roared Ill not stand your insolences

The little man turned scuttled indoors and came running back with a
chair

Permit me he said blandly holding it before him like a haircutter
for a customer

The parson turned away At the gap in the hedge he paused

Ill only say one thing more he called slowly When your wife whom
I think we all loved lay dying in that room above you she said to you
in my presence

It was MAdams turn to be angry He made a step forward with burning
face

Aince and for a Mr Hornbut he cried passionately onderstand Ill
not ha you and yer likes lay yer tongues on ma wifes memory whenever
it suits ye You can say what ye like aboot melies sneers snashand
Ill say naethin I dinna ask ye to respect me I think ye might do sae
muckle by her puir lass She never harmed ye Gin ye canna let her bide
in peace where she lies doon yonderhe waved in the direction of the
churchyardyell no come on ma land Though she is dead shes mine

Standing in front of his house with flushed face and big eyes the
little man looked almost noble in his indignation And the parson
striding away down the hill was uneasily conscious that with him was
not the victory




Chapter III RED WULL


THE winter came and went the lambing season was over and spring
already shyly kissing the land And the back of the years work broken
and her master well started on a fresh season MAdams old collie
Cuttie Sark lay down one evening and passed quietly away

The little blackandtan lady Parson Leggy used to say had been
the only thing on earth MAdam cared for Certainly the two had been
wondrously devoted and for many a marketday the Dalesmen missed the
shrill chuckling cry which heralded the pairs approach Weel done
Cuttie Sark

The little man felt his loss acutely and according to his wont vented
his illfeeling on David and the Dalesmen In return Tammas whose
forte lay in invective and alliteration called him behind his back
A wenomous one and A wiralent wiper to the applause of tinkling
pewters

A shepherd without his dog is like a ship without a rudder and MAdam
felt his loss practically as well as otherwise Especially did he
experience this on a day when he had to take a batch of draftewes over
to Grammochtown To help him Jem Burton had lent the services of his
herringgutted herringhearted greyhound lurcher Monkey But before
they had well topped Braithwaite Brow which leads from the village
on to the marches MAdam was standing in the track with a rock in his
hand a smile on his face and the tenderest blandishments in his voice
as he coaxed the dog to him But Master Monkey knew too much for that
However after gamboling a while longer in the middle of the flock a
boulder better aimed than its predecessors smote him on the hinder
parts and sent him back to the Sylvester Arms with a sore tail and a
subdued heart

For the rest MAdam would never have won over the sheepinfested
marches alone with his convoy had it not been for the help of old
Saunderson and Shep who caught him on the way and aided him

It was in a very wrathful mood that on his way home he turned into the
Dalesmans Daughter in Silverdale

The only occupants of the taproom as he entered were Teddy Bolstock
the publican Jim Mason with the faithful Betsy beneath his chair and
the postbags flung into the corner and one longlimbed droverlike
mana stranger

And he coom up to Mr Moore Teddy was saying and says he Ill gie
ye twal pun for yon gray dog o yourn Ah says Moore yo may gie
me twal hunnerd and yet youll not get ma BobEh Jim

And he did thot corroborated Jim Twal hunnerd says he

James Moore and his dog agin snapped MAdam Theres ithers in the
warld for bye them twa

Ay but none like em quoth loyal Jim

Na thanks be Gin there were thered be no room for Adam MAdam in
this melancholy vale

There was silence a moment and then

Youre wantin a tyke baint you Mr MAdam Jim asked

The little man hopped round all in a hurry

What he cried in wellaffected eagerness scanning the yellow mongrel
beneath the chair Betsy for sale Guid life Wheres ma checkbook
Whereat Jim most easily snubbed of men collapsed

MAdam took off his dripping coat and crossed the room to hang it on a
chairback The stranger drover followed the meagre shirtclad figure
with shifty eyes then he buried his face in his mug

MAdam reached out a hand for the chair and as he did so a bomb in
yellow leapt out from beneath it and growling horribly attacked his
ankles

Curse ye cried MAdam starting back

Ye devil let me alone Then turning fiercely on the drover Yours
mister he asked The man nodded Then call him aff cant ye Dn
ye At which Teddy Bolstock withdrew sniggering and Jim Mason slung
the postbags on to his shoulder and plunged out into the rain the
faithful Betsy following disconsolate

The cause of the squall having beaten off the attacking force had
withdrawn again beneath its chair MAdam stooped down still cursing
his wet coat on his arm and beheld a tiny yellow puppy crouching
defiant in the dark and glaring out with fiery light eyes Seeing
itself remarked it bared its little teeth raised its little bristles
and growled a hideous menace

A sense of humor is many a mans salvation and was MAdams one
redeeming feature The laughableness of the thingthis ferocious atomy
defying himstruck home to the little man Delighted at such a display
of vice in so tender a plant he fell to chuckling

Ye leetle devil he laughed He he ye leetle devil and flipped
together finger and thumb in vain endeavor to coax the puppy to him

But it growled and glared more terribly

Stop it ye little snake or Ill flatten you cried the big drover
and shuffled his feet threateningly Whereat the puppy gurgling like
hot water in a kettle made a feint as though to advance and wipe them
out these two bad men

MAdam laughed again and smote his leg

Keep a ceevil tongue and yer distance says he or Ill een ha to
mak ye Though he is but as big as a mans thumb a dogs a dog for
a thathe he the leetle devil And he fell to flipping finger and
thumb afresh

Yere maybe wantin a dog inquired the stranger Yer friend said as
much

Ma friend lied its his way MAdam replied

Im willin to part wi him the other pursued

The little man yawned Weel Ill tak him to oblige ye he said
indifferently

The drover rose to his feet

Its givin im ye fair givin im ye mind But Ill do ithe
smacked a great fist into a hollow palm Ye may have the dog for a
punIll only ask _you_ a pun and he walked away to the window

MAdam drew back the better to scan his wouldbe benefactor his lower
jaw dropped and he eyed the stranger with a drolly sarcastic air

A poun man A pouxifor yon noble dorg he pointed a crooked
forefinger at the little creature whose scowling mask peered from
beneath the chair Man I couldna do it Na na ma conscience wadna
permit me Twad be fair robbin ye Ah ye Englishmen he spoke half
to himself and sadly as if deploring the unhappy accident of his
nationality its yer grand openhairted generosity that grips a
puir Scotsman by the throat A poun and for yon He wagged his head
mournfully cocking it sideways the better to scan his subject

Take him or leave him ordered the drover truculently still gazing
out of the window

Wi yer permission Ill leave him MAdam answered meekly

Im short o the ready the big man pursued or I wouldna part with
him Could I bide me time theres manyd be glad to give me a tenner
for one o that bree he caught himself up hastilyfor a dog sic as
that

And yet ye offer him me for a poun Noble indeed

Nevertheless the little man had pricked his ears at the others slip
and quick correction Again he approached the puppy dangling his coat
before him to protect his ankles and again that wee wild beast sprang
out seized the coat in its small jaw and worried it savagely

MAdam stooped quickly and picked up his tiny assailant and the
puppy suspended by its neck gurgled and slobbered then wriggling
desperately round made its teeth meet in its adversarys shirt At
which MAdam shook it gently and laughed Then he set to examining it

Apparently some six weeks old a tawny coat fiery eyes a square head
with small cropped ears and a comparatively immense jaw the whole
giving promise of great strength if little beauty And this effect
was enhanced by the manner of its docking For the miserable relic of
a tail yet raw looked little more than a red button adhering to its
wearers stern

MAdams inspection was as minute as it was apparently absorbing he
omitted nothing from the square muzzle to the lozengelike scut And
every now and then he threw a quick glance at the man at the window who
was watching the careful scrutiny a thought uneasily

Yeve cut him short he said at length swinging round on the drover

Ay strengthens their backs the big man answered with averted gaze

MAdams chin went up in the air his mouth partly opened and his
eyelids partly closed as he eyed his informant

Oh ay he said

Gie him back to me ordered the drover surlily He took the puppy
and set it on the floor whereupon it immediately resumed its former
fortified position Yere no buyer I knoo that all along by that face
on ye he said in insulting tones

Ye wad ha bought him yerseif nae doot MAdam inquired blandly

In course if you says so

Or airblins ye bred him

Appen I did

Yell no be from these parts

Will I no answered the other

A smile of genuine pleasure stole over MAdams face He laid his hand
on the others arm

Man he said gently ye mind me o hame Then almost in the same
breath Ye said ye found him

It was the strangers turn to laugh

Ha ha Ye teekle me little mon Found im Nay I was give im by a
friend But theres nowt amiss wi his breedin ye may believe me

The great fellow advanced to the chair under which the puppy lay It
leapt out like a lion and fastened on his huge boot

A rare bred un look ee a rare game un Ma word hes a bighearted
un Look at the back on him see the jaws to him mark the pluck of
him He shook his booted foot fiercely tossing his leg to and fro like
a tree in a wind But the little creature now raised ceilingward now
dashed to the ground held on with incomparable doggedness till its
small jaw was all bloody and muzzle wrinkled with the effort

Ay ay thatll do MAdam interposed irritably

The drover ceased his efforts

Now Ill mak ye a last offer He thrust his head down to a level
with the others shooting out his neck Its throwin him at ye mind
Taint buyin him yell bedont go for to deceive yourself Ye may
have him for fifteen shillin Why do I do it ye ask Why cos I think
yell be kind to him as the puppy retreated to its chair leaving a
spotted track of red along its route

Ay ye wadna be happy gin ye thocht hed no a comfortable hame
conseederate man MAdam answered eyeing the dark track on the floor
Then he put on his coat

Na na hes no for me Weel Ill no detain ye Goodnicht to ye
mister and he made for the door

A gran worker hell be called the drover after him

Ay muckle wark hell mak amang the sheep wi sic a jaw and sic a
temper Weel I maun be steppin Goodnicht to ye

Yell niver have sich anither chanst

Nor niver wush to Na na hell never mak a sheepdog and the
little man turned up the collar of his coat

Will he not cried the other scornfully There niver yet was one o
that line he stopped abruptly

The little man spun round

Iss he said as innocent as any child ye were sayin

The other turned to the window and watched the rain falling
monotonously

Yell be wantin wet he said adroitly

Ay we could do wi a drappin And hell never mak a sheepdog
He shoved his cap down on his head Weel goodnicht to ye and he
stepped out into the rain

     

It was long after dark when the bargain was finally struck

Adam MAdams Red Wull became that little mans property for the
following realizable assets ninepence in cashthree coppers and a
doubtful sixpence a plug of suspicious tobacco in a wellworn pouch
and an old watch

Its clean givin im ye said the stranger bitterly at the end of
the deal

Its mair the charity than aught else maks me sae leeberal the other
answered gently I wad not like to see ye pinched

Thank ye kindly the big man replied with some acerbity and plunged
out into the darkness and rain Nor was that longlimbed droverman ever
again seen in the countryside And the puppys previous historywhether
he was honestly come by or no whether he was indeed of the famous Red
McCulloch strain ever remained a mystery in the Daleland

 N BYou may know a Red McCulloch anywhere by the ring of
 white upon his tail some two inches from the root




Chapter IV FIRST BLOOD


AFTER that first encounter in the Dalesmans Daughter Red Wull for
so MAdam called him resigned himself complacently to his lot
recognizing perhaps his destiny

Thenceforward the sour little man and the vicious puppy grew as it
were together The two were never apart Where MAdam was there was
sure to be his tiny attendant bristling defiance as he kept ludicrous
guard over his master

The little man and his dog were inseparable MAdam never left him even
at the Grange

I couldna trust ma Wullie at hame alone wi the dear lad was his
explanation I ken weel Id come back to find a wee corpse on the
floor and David singin

 My heart is sair I daur na tell
 My heart is sair for somebody

Ay and hed be sair elsewhere by the time Id done wi himhe he

The sneer at Davids expense was as characteristic as it was unjust
For though the puppy and the boy were already sworn enemies yet the
lad would have scorned to harm so small a foe And many a tale did David
tell at Kenmuir of Red Wulls viciousness of his hatred of him David
and his devotion to his master how whether immersed in the pigbucket
or chasing the fleeting rabbit he would desist at once and bundle
panting up at his masters call how he routed the tomcat and drove him
from the kitchen and how he clambered on to Davids bed and pinned him
murderously by the nose

Of late the relations between MAdam and James Moore had been unusually
strained Though they were neighbors communications between the two
were of the rarest and it was for the first time for many a long
day that on an afternoon shortly after Red Wull had come into his
possession MAdam entered the yard of Kenmuir bent on girding at the
master for an alleged trespass at the Stony Bottom

Wi yer permission Mr Moore said the little man Ill wheestle ma
dog and turning he whistled a shrill peculiar note like the cry of
a disturbed peewit

Straightway there came scurrying desperately up ears back head down
tongue out as if the world depended on his speed a little tawny beetle
of a thing who placed his forepaws against his masters ankles
and looked up into his face then catching sight of the strangers
hurriedly he took up his position between them and MAdam assuming his
natural attitude of grisly defiance Such a laughable spectacle he made
that martial mite standing at bay with bristles up and teeth bared
that even James Moore smiled

Ma word Ha yo brought his muzzle man cried old Tammas the
humorist and turning climbed all in a heat on to an upturned bucket
that stood by Whereat the puppy emboldened by his foes retreat
advanced savagely to the attack buzzing round the slippery pail like a
wasp on a windowpane in a vain attempt to reach the old man

Tammas stood on the top hitching his trousers and looking down on his
assailant the picture of mortal fear

Elp Oh elp he bawled Send for the sogers Fetch the plice
For lawkamussys sake call him off man Even Saml Todd watching
the scene from the cartshed was tickled and burst into a loud guffaw
heartily backed by Enry and oor Job While MAdam remarked Yere
fitter for a stage than a stablebucket Mr Thornton

How didst come by him asked Tammas nodding at the puppy

Found him the little man replied sucking his twig Found him in
ma stockin on ma birthday A present from ma leetle David for his auld
dad I doot

So do I said Tammas and was seized with sudden spasm of seemingly
causeless merriment For looking up as MAdam was speaking he had
caught a glimpse of a boys fair head peering cautiously round the
cowshed and behind the flutter of short petticoats They disappeared
as silently as they had come and two small figures just returned from
school glided away and sought shelter in the friendly darkness of a
coalhole

Coom awa Maggie coom awa Tis th owd un isself whispered a
disrespectful voice

MAdam looked round suspiciously

Whats that he asked sharply

At the moment however Mrs Moore put her head out of the kitchen
window

Coom thy ways in Mister MAdam and tak a soop o tea she called
hospitably

Thank ye kindly Mrs Moore I will he answered politely for him
And this one good thing must be allowed of Adam MAdam that if there
was only one woman of whom he was ever known to speak well there was
also only one in the whole course of his life against whom he ever
insinuated eviland that was years afterward when men said his brain
was sapped Flouts and jeers he had for every man but a woman good or
bad was sacred to him For the sex that had given him his mother and
his wife he had that sentiment of tender reverence which if a man still
preserve he cannot be altogether bad As he turned into the house he
looked back at Red Wull

Ay we may leave him he said That is gin yere no afraid Mr
Thornton

Of what happened while the men were within doors it is enough to tell
two things First that Owd Bob was no bully Second this In the code
of sheepdog honor there is written a word in stark black letters and
opposite it another word writ large in the color of blood The first
is Sheepmurder the second Death It is the one crime only to
be wiped away in blood and to accuse of the crime is to offer the one
unpardonable insult Every sheepdog knows it and every shepherd

That afternoon as the men still talked the quiet echoes of the
farm rung with a furious animal cry twice repeated Shot for
sheepmurderShot for sheepmurder followed by a hollow stillness

     

The two men finished their colloquy The matter was concluded
peacefully mainly owing to the pacifying influence of Mrs Moore
Together the three went out into the yard Mrs Moore seizing the
opportunity to shyly speak on Davids behalf

Hes such a good little lad I do think she was saying

Ye should ken Mrs Moore the little man answered a thought
bitterly ye see enough of him

Yo mun be main proud of un mester the woman continued heedless of
the sneer an im growin such a gradely lad

MAdam shrugged his shoulders

I barely ken the lad he said By sight I know him of course but
barely to speak to Hes but seldom at hame

An hoo proud his motherd be if she could see him the woman
continued well aware of his one tender place Eh but she was fond o
him so she was

An angry flush stole over the little mans face Well he understood the
implied rebuke and it hurt him like a knife

Ay ay Mrs Moore he began Then breaking off and looking about
himWheres ma Wullie he cried excitedly James Moore whipping
round on the Master ma Wullies gonegone I say

Elizabeth Moore turned away indignantly I do declar he taks more
fash after yon little yaller beastie than iver he does after his own
flesh she muttered

Wullie ma we doggie Wullie where are ye James Moore hes gonema
Wullies gone cried the little man running about the yard searching
everywhere

Cannot a gotten far said the Master reassuringly looking about
him

Niver no tellin said Saml appearing on the scene pigbucket
in hand I misdoot yoll iver see your dog agin mister He turned
sorrowfully to MAdam

That little man all dishevelled and with the perspiration standing on
his face came hurrying out of the cowshed and danced up to the Master

Its robbed I amrobbed I tell ye he cried recklessly Ma wee
Wulls bin stolen while I was ben your hoose James Moore

Yo munna say that ma mon No robbin at Kenmuir the Master answered
sternly

Then where is he Its for you to say

Ive ma own idee I aye Saml announced opportunely pigbucket
uplifted

MAdam turned on him

What man What is it

I misdoot yoll iver see your dog agin mister Saml repeated as if
he was supplying the key to the mystery

Noo Saml if yo know owt tell it ordered his master

Saml grunted sulkily

Wheers oor Bob then he asked

At that MAdam turned on the Master

Tis that nae doot Its yer gray dog James Moore yer  dog I
might ha kent itand he loosed off a volley of foul words

Sweerin will no find him said the Master coldly Noo Saml

The big man shifted his feet and looked mournfully at MAdam

Twas appen aif an hour agone when I sees oor Bob goin oot o
yard wi little yaller tyke in his mouth In a minnit I looks aginand
theer little yaller un was gone and oor Bob asittin alickin
his chops Gone foriver I do reckn Ah yo may well take on Tammas
Thornton For the old man was rolling about the yard bent double with
merriment

MAdam turned on the Master with the resignation of despair

Man Moore he cried piteously its yer gray dog has murdered ma wee
Wull Ye have it from yer ain man

Nonsense said the Master encouragingly Tis but yon girt oof

Saml tossed his head and snorted

Coom then and ill show yo he said and led the way out of the
yard And there below them on the slope to the stream sitting like
Justice at the Courts of Law was Owd Bob

Straightway Saml whose humor was something of the calibre of old
Rosss the sexton burst into horsemerriment Whys he sittin so
still think ee Ho Ho See un lickin his chopsha haand he
roared afresh While from afar you could hear the distant rumbling of
Enry and oor Job

At the sight MAdam burst into a storm of passionate invective and
would have rushed on the dog had not James Moore forcibly restrained
him

Bob lad called the Master coom here

But even as he spoke the gray dog cocked his ears listened a moment
and then shot down the slope At the same moment Tammas hallooed Theer
he be yons yaller un coomin oot o drain La Saml And there
indeed on the slope below them a little angry smuttyfaced figure was
crawling out of a rabbitburrow

Ye murderin devil wad ye duar touch ma Wullie yelled MAdam and
breaking away pursued hotly down the hill for the gray dog had picked
up the puppy like a lancer a tentpeg and was sweeping on his captive
in his mouth toward the stream

Behind hurried James Moore and Saml wondering what the issue of the
comedy would be After them toddled old Tammas chuckling While over
the yardwall was now a little cluster of heads Enry oor Job Maggie
and David and Vilet Thornton the dairymaid

Straight on to the plankbridge galloped Owd Bob In the middle he
halted leant over and dropped his prisoner who fell with a cool plop
into the running water beneath

Another moment and MAdam had reached the bank of the stream In he
plunged splashing and cursing and seized the struggling puppy then
waded back the waters surging about his waist and Red Wull limp as
a wet rag in his hand The little mans hair was dripping for his cap
was gone his clothes clung to him exposing the miserableness of his
figure and his eyes blazed like hot ashes in his wet face

He sprang on to the bank and beside himself with passion rushed at
Owd Bob

Curse ye for a 

Stan back or yoll have him at your throat shouted the Master
thundering up Stan back I say yo fule And as the little man
still came madly on he reached forth his hand and hurled him back at
the same moment bending he buried the other hand deep in Owd Bobs
shaggy neck It was but just in time for if ever the fierce desire of
battle gleamed in gray eyes it did in the young dogs as MAdam came
down on him

The little man staggered tottered and fell heavily At the shock the
blood gushed from his nose and mixing with the water on his face ran
down in vague red streams dripping off his chin while Red Wull jerked
from his grasp was thrown afar and lay motionless

Curse ye MAdam screamed his face deadwhite save for the running
red about his jaw Curse ye for a cowardly Englishman and struggling
to his feet he made at the Master

But Saml interposed his great bulk between the two

Easy little mon he said leisurely regarding the small fury before
him with mournful interest Eh but thee do be a little spitcat
surely

James Moore stood breathing deep his hand still buried in Owd Bobs
coat

If yod touched him he explained I couldna ha stopped him Hed
ha mauled yo afore iver I could ha had him off Theyre bad to hold
the Gray Dogs when theyre roosed

Ay ma word that they are corroborated Tammas speaking from the
experience of sixty years Once on yo canna get em off

The little man turned away

Yere all agin me he said and his voice shook A pitiful figure he
made standing there with the water dripping from him A red stream was
running slowly from his chin his head was bare and face working

James Moore stood eyeing him with some pity and some contempt Behind
was Tammas enjoying the scene While Saml regarded them all with an
impassive melancholy

MAdam turned and bent over Red Wull who still lay like a dead thing
As his master handled him the buttontail quivered feebly he opened
his eyes looked about him snarled faintly and glared with devilish
hate at the gray dog and the group with him

The little man picked him up stroking him tenderly Then he turned away
and on to the bridge Halfway across he stopped It rattled feverishly
beneath him for he still trembled like a palsied man

Man Moore he called striving to quell the agitation in his
voiceI wad shoot yon dog

Across the bridge he turned again Man Moore he called and paused
Yell not forget this day And with that the blood flared up a dull
crimson into his white face




PART II THE LITTLE MAN




Chapter V A MANS SON


THE storm long threatened having once burst MAdam allowed loose rein
to his bitter animosity against James Moore

The two often met For the little man frequently returned home from the
village by the footpath across Kenmuir It was out of his way but
he preferred it in order to annoy his enemy and keep a watch upon his
doings

He haunted Kenmuir like its evil genius His sallow face was perpetually
turning up at inopportune moments When Kenmuir Queen the prize
shorthorn heifer calved unexpectedly and unattended in the dip by the
lane Tammas and the Master summoned hurriedly by Owd Bob came running
up to find the little man leaning against the stile and shaking with
silent merriment Again poor old Staggy daring still in his dotage
took a fall while scrambling on the steep banks of the Stony Bottom
There he lay for hours unnoticed and kicking until James Moore and
Owd Bob came upon him at length nearly exhausted But MAdam was before
them Standing on the far bank with Red Wull by his side he called
across the gulf with apparent concern Hes bin so sin yesternight
Often James Moore with all his great strength of character could
barely control himself

There were two attempts to patch up the feud Jim Mason who went about
the world seeking to do good tried in his shy way to set things right
But MAdam and his Red Wull between them soon shut him and Betsy up

You mind yer letters and yer wires Mr PoacherPostman Ay I saw em
baith th ain doon by the Haughs tither in the Bottom And theres
Wullie the humorsome chiel havin a rare game wi Betsy There
indeed lay the faithful Betsy suppliant on her back paws up throat
exposed while Red Wull now a greatgrown puppy stood over her his
habitually evil expression intensified into a fiendish grin as with
wrinkled muzzle and savage wheeze he waited for a movement as a pretext
to pin Wullie let the leddy beyeve had yer dinner

Parson Leggy was the other wouldbe mediator for he hated to see the
two principal parishioners of his tiny cure at enmity First he tackled
James Moore on the subject but that laconic person cut him short with
Ive nowt agin the little mon and would say no more And indeed the
quarrel was none of his making

Of the parsons interview with MAdam it is enough to say here that
in the end the angry old minister would of a surety have assaulted his
mocking adversary had not Cyril Gilbraith forcibly withheld him

And after that the vendetta must take its course unchecked

David was now the only link between the two farms Despite his fathers
angry commands the boy clung to his intimacy with the Moores with a
doggedness that no thrashing could overcome Not a minute of the day
when out of school holidays and Sundays included but was passed at
Kenmuir It was not till late at night that he would sneak back to the
Grange and creep quietly up to his tiny bare room in the roofnot
supperless indeed motherly Mrs Moore had seen to that And there he
would lie awake and listen with a fierce contempt as his father hours
later lurched into the kitchen below lilting liquorishly

 We are na fou were nae that fou
 But just a drappie in our ee
 The cock may craw the day may daw
 And ay well taste the barley bree

And in the morning the boy would slip quietly out of the house while his
father still slept only Red Wull would thrust out his savage head as
the lad passed and snarl hungrily

Sometimes father and son would go thus for weeks without sight of one
another And that was Davids aimto escape attention It was only his
cunning at this game of evasion that saved him a thrashing

The little man seemed devoid of all natural affection for his son He
lavished the whole fondness of which his small nature appeared capable
on the Tailless Tyke for so the Dalesmen called Red Wull And the dog
he treated with a careful tenderness that made David smile bitterly

The little man and his dog were as alike morally as physically they were
contrasted Each owed a grudge against the world and was determined to
pay it Each was an Ishmael among his kind

You saw them thus standing apart leperlike in the turmoil of life
and it came quite as a revelation to happen upon them in some quiet spot
of nights playing together each wrapped in the game innocent tender
forgetful of the hostile world

The two were never separated except only when MAdam came home by the
path across Kenmuir After that first misadventure he never allowed his
friend to accompany him on the journey through the enemys country for
well he knew that sheepdogs have long memories

To the stile in the lane then Red Wull would follow him There he
would stand his great head poked through the bars watching his master
out of sight and then would turn and trot selfreliant and defiant
sturdy and surly down the very centre of the road through the
villageno playing no enticing away and woe to that man or dog who
tried to stay him in his course And so on past Mother Rosss shop
past the Sylvester Arms to the right by Kirbys smithy over the
Wastrel by the Haughs to await his master at the edge of the Stony
Bottom

The little man when thus crossing Kenmuir often met Owd Bob who had
the free run of the farm On these occasions he passed discreetly by
for though he was no coward yet it is bad singlehanded to attack
a Gray Dog of Kenmuir while the dog trotted soberly on his way only
a steely glint in the big gray eyes betraying his knowledge of the
presence of his foe As surely however as the little man in his
desire to spy out the nakedness of the land strayed off the public
path so surely a gray figure seeming to spring from out the blue
would come fiercely silently driving down on him and he would turn and
run for his life amid the uproarious jeers of any of the farmhands who
were witness to the encounter

On these occasions David vied with Tammas in facetiousness at his
fathers expense

Good on yo little un he roared from behind a wall on one such
occurrence

Baint he a runner neither yelled Tammas not to be outdone

See un skip itho ho Look to his knees awamblin from the
undutiful son in ecstasy An Id knees like yon Id wear petticoats
As he spoke a swinging box on the ear nearly knocked the young
reprobate down

Dyo think God gave you a dad for you to jeer at Yought to be
ashamed o yoself Serve yo right if he does thrash yo when yo get
home And David turning round found James Moore close behind him his
heavy eyebrows lowering over his eyes

Luckily MAdam had not distinguished his sons voice among the others
But David feared he had for on the following morning the little man
said to him

David yell come hame immediately after school today

Will I said David pertly

Ye will

Why

Because I tell ye to ma lad and that was all the reason he would
give Had he told the simple fact that he wanted help to drench a
husking ewe things might have gone differently As it was David
turned away defiantly down the hill

The afternoon wore on Schooltime was long over still there was no
David

The little man waited at the door of the Grange fuming hopping from
one leg to the other talking to Red Wull who lay at his feet his head
on his paws like a tiger waiting for his prey

At length he could restrain himself no longer and started running down
the hill his heart burning with indignation

Wait till we lay hands on ye ma lad he muttered as he ran Well
warm ye well teach ye

At the edge of the Stony Bottom he as always left Red Wull Crossing
it himself and rounding Langholm How he espied James Moore David and
Owd Bob walking away from him and in the direction of Kenmuir The gray
dog and David were playing together wrestling racing and rolling The
boy had never a thought for his father

The little man ran up behind them unseen and unheard his feet softly
pattering on the grass His hand had fallen on Davids shoulder before
the boy had guessed his approach

Did I bid ye come hame after school David he asked concealing his
heat beneath a suspicious suavity

Maybe Did I say I would come

The pertness of tone and words alike fanned his fathers resentment
into a blaze In a burst of passion he lunged forward at the boy with
his stick But as he smote a gray whirlwind struck him fair on the
chest and he fell like a snapped stake and lay half stunned with a
dark muzzle an inch from his throat

Git back Bob shouted James Moore hurrying up Git back I tell
yo He bent over the prostrate figure propping it up anxiously

Are yo hurt MAdam Eh but I am sorry He thought yo were going for
to strike the lad

David had now run up and he too bent over his father with a very
scared face

Are yo hurt feyther he asked his voice trembling

The little man rose unsteadily to his feet and shook off his supporters
His face was twitching and he stood all dustbegrimed looking at his
son

Yere content aiblins noo yeve seen yer fathers gray head bowed in
the dust he said

Twas an accident pleaded James Moore But I _am_ sorry He thought
yo were goin to beat the lad

So I wasso I will

If onys beat it should be ma Bob here tho he nobbut thought he was
doin right An yo were aff the path

The little man looked at his enemy a sneer on his face

Ye canna thrash him for doin what ye bid him Set yer dog on me if ye
will but dinna beat him when he does yer biddin

I did not set him on yo as you know the Master replied warmly

MAdam shrugged his shoulders

Ill no argie wi ye James Moore he said Ill leave you and
what ye call yer conscience to settle that My business is not wi
youDavid turning to his son

A stranger might well have mistaken the identity of the boys father
For he stood now holding the Masters arm while a few paces above
them was the little man pale but determined the expression on his face
betraying his consciousness of the irony of the situation

Will ye come hame wi me and have it noo or stop wi him and wait till
ye get it he asked the boy

MAdam Id like yo to

None o that James MooreDavid what dye say

David looked up into his protectors face

Yod best go wi your feyther lad said the Master at last thickly
The boy hesitated and clung tighter to the shielding arm then he
walked slowly over to his father

A bitter smile spread over the little mans face as he marked this new
test of the boys obedience to the other

To obey his frien he foregoes the pleasure o disobeyin his father
he muttered Noble Then he turned homeward and the boy followed in
his footsteps

James Moore and the gray dog stood looking after them

I know yoll not pay off yer spite agin me on the lads head MAdam
he called almost appealingly

Ill do ma duty thank ye James Moore wioot respect o persons the
little man cried back never turning

Father and son walked away one behind the other like a man and his
dog and there was no word said between them Across the Stony Bottom
Red Wull scowling with bared teeth at David joined them Together the
three went up the bill to the Grange

In the kitchen MAdam turned

Noo Im gaein to gie ye the granest thrashin ye iver dreamed of
Tak aff yer coat

The boy obeyed and stood up in his thin shirt his face white and set
as a statues Red Wull seated himself on his haunches close by his
ears pricked licking his lips all attention

The little man suppled the great ashplant in his hands and raised it
But the expression on the boys face arrested his arm

Say yere sorry and Ill let yer aff easy

Ill not

One mair chanceyer last Say yer shamed o yerself

Im not

The little man brandished his cruel white weapon and Red Wull shifted
a little to obtain a better view

Git on wi it ordered David angrily

The little man raised the stick again andthrew it into the farthest
corner of the room

It fell with a rattle on the floor and MAdam turned away

Yere the pitifulest son iver a man had he cried brokenly Gin
a mans son dinna haud to him wha can he expect tono one Yere
ondootiful yere disrespectfu yere maist ilka thing ye shouldna be
theres but ae thing I thocht ye were nota coward And as to that
yeve no the pluck to say yere sorry when God knows ye might be I
canna thrash ye this day But ye shall gae nae mair to school I send
ye there to learn Yell not learnyeve learnt naethin except
disobedience to meye shall stop at hame and work

His fathers rare emotion his broken voice and working face moved
David as all the stripes and jeers had failed to do His conscience
smote him For the first time in his life it dimly dawned on him that
perhaps his father too had some ground for complaint that perhaps
he was not a good son

He half turned

Feyther

Git oot o ma sight MAdam cried

And the boy turned and went




Chapter VI A LICKING OR A LIE


THENCEFORWARD David buckled down to work at home and in one point only
father and son resembledindustry A drunkard MAdam was but a drone
no

The boy worked at the Grange with tireless indomitable energy yet he
could never satisfy his father

The little man would stand a sneer on his face and his thin lips
contemptuously curled and flout the lads brave labors

Is he no a gran worker Wullie Tis a pleasure to watch him his
hands in his pockets his eyes turned heavenward as the boy snatched
a hardearned moments rest You and I Wullie well brak oorsels
slavin for him while he looks on and laffs

And so on the whole day through week in week out till he sickened
with weariness of it all

In his darkest hours David thought sometimes to run away He was
miserably alone on the cold bosom of the world The very fact that he
was the son of his father isolated him in the Daleland Naturally of a
reserved disposition he had no single friend outside Kenmuir And it
was only the thought of his friends there that withheld him He could
not bring himself to part from them they were all he had in the world

So he worked on at the Grange miserably doggedly taking blows and
abuse alike in burning silence But every evening when work was ended
he stepped off to his other home beyond the Stony Bottom And on Sundays
and holidaysfor of these latter he took unasking what he knew to be
his dueall day long from cockcrowing to the going down of the sun
he would pass at Kenmuir In this one matter the boy was invincibly
stubborn Nothing his father could say or do sufficed to break him of
the habit He endured everything with whitelipped silent doggedness
and still held on his way

Once past the Stony Bottom he threw his troubles behind him with a
courage that did him honor Of all the people at Kenmuir two only ever
dreamed the whole depth of his unhappiness and that not through David
James Moore suspected something of it all for he knew more of MAdam
than did the others While Owd Bob knew it as did no one else He could
tell it from the touch of the boys hand on his head and the story was
writ large upon his face for a dog to read And he would follow the lad
about with a compassion in his sad gray eyes greater than words

David might well compare his gray friend at Kenmuir with that other at
the Grange

The Tailless Tyke had now grown into an immense dog heavy of muscle and
huge of bone A great bull head undershot jaw square and lengthy and
terrible vicious yellowgleaming eyes cropped ears and an expression
incomparably savage His coat was a tawny lionlike yellow short
harsh dense and his back running up from shoulder to loins ended
abruptly in the knoblike tail He looked like the devil of a dogs
hell And his reputation was as bad as his looks He never attacked
unprovoked but a challenge was never ignored and he was greedy of
insults Already he had nigh killed Rob Saundersons collie Shep Jem
Burtons Monkey fled incontinently at the sound of his approach while
he had even fought a round with that redoubtable trio the Vexer Venus
and Van Tromp

Nor in the matter of war did he confine himself to his own kind
His huge strength and indomitable courage made him the match of almost
anything that moved Long Kirby once threatened him with a broomstick
the smith never did it again While in the Border Ram he attacked Big
Bell the Squires underkeeper with such murderous fury that it took
all the men in the room to pull him off

More than once had he and Owd Bob essayed to wipe out mutual memories
Red Wull in this case only the aggressor As yet however while they
fenced a moment for that deadly throatgrip the value of which each
knew so well James Moore had always seized the chance to intervene

Thats right hide him ahint yer petticoats sneered MAdam on one of
these occasions

Hide Itll not be him Ill hide I warn you MAdam the Master
answered grimly as he stood twirling his good oak stick between the
wouldbe duellists Whereat there was a loud laugh at the little mans
expense

It seemed as if there were to be other points of rivalry between the two
than memories For in the matter of his own businessthe handling of
sheepRed Wull bid fair to be second only throughout the Daleland to
the Gray Dog of Kenmuir And MAdam was patient and painstaking in the
training of his Wullie in a manner to astonish David It would have been
touching had it not been so unnatural in view of his treatment of his
own blood to watch the tender carefulness with which the little man
moulded the dog beneath his hands After a promising display he would
stand rubbing his palms together as near content as ever he was

Weel done Wullie Weel done Bide a wee and well show em a thing or
two you and I Wullie

 The warlds wrack we share ot
 The warstle and the care ot

For its you and I alane lad And the dog would trot up to him place
his great forepaws on his shoulders and stand thus with his great head
overtopping his masters his ears back and stump tail vibrating

You saw them at their best when thus together displaying each his one
soft side to the other

From the very first David and Red Wull were open enemies under the
circumstances indeed nothing else was possible Sometimes the great
dog would follow on the lads heels with surly greedy eyes never
leaving him from sunrise to sundown till David could hardly hold his
hands

So matters went on for a neverending year Then there came a climax

One evening on a day throughout which Red Wull had dogged him thus
hungrily David his work finished went to pick up his coat which he
had left hard by On it lay Red Wull

Git off ma coat the boy ordered angrily marching up But the great
dog never stirred he lifted a lip to show a fence of white even teeth
and seemed to sink lower in the ground his head on his paws his eyes
in his forehead

Come and take it he seemed to say

Now what between master and dog David had endured almost more than he
could bear that day

Yo wont wont yo girt brute he shouted and bending snatched
a corner of the coat and attempted to jerk it away At that Red Wull
rose shivering to his feet and with a low gurgle sprang at the boy

David quick as a flash dodged bent and picked up an ugly stake
lying at his feet Swinging round all in a moment he dealt his
antagonist a mighty buffet on the side of the head Dazed with the blow
the great dog fell then recovering himself with a terrible deep roar
he sprang again Then it must have gone hard with the boy finegrown
muscular young giant though he was For Red Wull was now in the first
bloom of that great strength which earned him afterward an undying
notoriety in the land

As it chanced however MAdam had watched the scene from the kitchen
And now he came hurrying out of the house shrieking commands and curses
at the combatants As Red Wull sprang he interposed between the two
head back and eyes flashing His small person received the full shock
of the charge He staggered but recovered and in an imperative voice
ordered the dog to heel

Then he turned on David seized the stake from his hand and began
furiously belaboring the boy

Ill teach ye to strikea puirdumbharmlesscreetur
yecruelcruellad he cried Hoo daur ye strikemaWullie
yerfathersWullie AdamM AdamsRed Wull He was panting from
his exertions and his eyes were blazing I pit up as best I can wi
all manner o disrespect to masel but when it comes to takin ma puir
Wullie I canna thole it Ha ye no heart he asked unconscious of the
irony of the question

As much as some I reckn David muttered

Eh whats that What dye say

Ye may thrash me till yere blind and its nobbut yer duty but if
only one daurs so much as to look at yer Wullie yere mad the boy
answered bitterly And with that he turned away defiantly and openly in
the direction of Kenmuir

MAdam made a step forward and then stopped

Ill see ye agin ma lad this evenin he cried with cruel
significance

I doot but yoll be too drunk to see owtexcept appen your bottle
the boy shouted back and swaggered down the hill

     

At Kenmuir that night the marked and particular kindness of Elizabeth
Moore was too much for the overstrung lad Overcome by the contrast of
her sweet motherliness he burst into a storm of invective against his
father his home his lifeeverything

Dont ee Davie dont ee dearie cried Mrs Moore much
distressed And taking him to her she talked to the great sobbing boy
as though he were a child At length he lifted his face and looked up
and seeing the white wan countenance of his dear comforter was struck
with tender remorse that he had given way and pained her who looked so
frail and thin herself

He mastered himself with an effort and for the rest of the evening
was his usual cheery self He teased Maggie into tears chaffed stolid
little Andrew and bantered Saml Todd until that generally impassive
man threatened to bash his snout for him

Yet it was with a great swallowing at his throat that later he turned
down the slope for home

James Moore and Parson Leggy accompanied him to the bridge over the
Wastrel and stood a while watching as he disappeared into the summer
night

Yons a good lad said the Master half to himself

Yes the parson replied I always thought there was good in the boy
if only his fatherd give him a chance And look at the way Owd Bob
there follows him Theres not another soul outside Kenmuir hed do that
for

Ay sir said the Master Bob knows a mon when he sees one

He does acquiesced the other And by the by James the talk in the
village is that youve settled not to run him for the Cup Is that so

The Master nodded

It is sir Theyre all mad I should but I mun cross em They say
hes reached his primeand so he has o his body but not o his brain
And a sheepdogunlike other dogsis not at his best till his brain
is at its bestand that takes a while developin same as in a mon I
reckn

Well well said the parson pulling out a favorite phrase waitings
winningwaitings winning

     

David slipped up into his room and into bed unseen he hoped Alone with
the darkness he allowed himself the rare relief of tears and at length
fell asleep He awoke to find his father standing at his bedside The
little man held a feeble dipcandle in his hand which lit his sallow
face in crude black and white In the doorway dimly outlined was the
great figure of Red Wull

Whaur ha ye been the day the little man asked Then looking down on
the white stained face beneath him he added hurriedly If ye like to
lie Ill believe ye

David was out of bed and standing up in his nightshirt He looked at
his father contemptuously

I ha bin at Kenmuir Ill not lie for yo or your likes he said
proudly

The little man shrugged his shoulders

Tell a lee and stick to it is my rule and a good one too in
honest England I for one ll no think ony the worse o ye if yer memory
plays yer false

Dyo think I care a kick what yo think o me the boy asked
brutally Nay theres nough liars in this famly wioot me

The candle trembled and was still again

A lickin or a lietak yer choice

The boy looked scornfully down on his father Standing on his naked
feet he already towered half a head above the other and was twice the
man

Dyo think Im feard o a thrashin fra yo Goo gracious me he
sneered Why Id as lief let owd Grammer Maddox lick me for all I
care

A reference to his physical insufficiencies fired the little man as
surely as a lighted match powder

Ye maun be cauld standin there so Rin ye doon and fetch oor little
friena reference to a certain strap hanging in the kitchen Ill
see if I can warm ye

David turned and stumbled down the unlit narrow stairs The hard cold
boards struck like death against his naked feet At his heels followed
Red Wull his hot breath fanning the boys bare legs

So into the kitchen and back up the stairs and Red Wull always
following

Ill no despair yet o teachin ye the fifth commandment though I kill
masel in doin it cried the little man seizing the strap from the
boys numb grasp

     

When it was over MAdam turned breathless away At the threshold
of the room he stopped and looked round a little dimlit devilish
figure framed in the door while from the blackness behind Red Wulls
eyes gleamed yellow

Glancing back the little man caught such an expression on Davids
face that for once he was fairly afraid He banged the door and hobbled
actively down the stairs




Chapter VII THE WHITE WINTER


MADAMin his sober moments at leastnever touched David again
instead he devoted himself to the more congenial exercise of the
whiplash of his tongue And he was wise for David who was already
nigh a head the taller of the two and comely and strong in proportion
could if he would have taken his father in the hollow of his hand and
crumpled him like a dry leaf Moreover with his tongue at least the
little man enjoyed the noble pleasure of making the boy wince And so
the war was carried on none the less vindictively

Meanwhile another summer was passing away and every day brought fresh
proofs of the prowess of Owd Bob Tammas whose stock of yarns anent Rex
son of Rally had after forty years hard wear begun to pall on the
loyal ears of even old Jonas found no lack of new material now In
the Dalesmans Daughter in Silverdale and in the Border Ram at
Grammochtown each succeeding market day brought some fresh tale Men
told how the gray dog had outdone Gypsy Jack the sheepsneak how he
had cut out a Kenmuir shearling from the very centre of Londesleys
pack and a thousand like stories

The Gray Dogs of Kenmuir have always been equally heroes and favorites
in the Daleland And the confidence of the Dalesmen in Owd Bob was now
invincible Sometimes on market days he would execute some unaccountable
maneuvre and strange shepherd would ask Whats the gray dog at
To which the nearest Dalesman would reply Nay I canno tell ye But
hes reet enough Yons Owd Bob o Kenmuir

Whereon the stranger would prick his ears and watch with close
attention

Yons Owd Bob o Kenmuir is he he would say for already among the
faculty the name was becoming known And never in such a case did the
young dog fail to justify the faith of his supporters

It came therefore as a keen disappointment to every Dalesman from
Herbert Trotter Secretary of the Trials to little Billy Thornton when
the Master persisted in his decision not to run the dog for the Cup in
the approaching Dale Trials and that though parson squire and even
Lady Eleanour essayed to shake his purpose It was nigh fifty years
since Rex son o Rally had won back the Trophy for the land that gave
it birth it was time they thought for a Daleland dog a Gray Dog of
Kenmuirthe terms are practically synonymousto bring it home again
And Tammas that polished phrasemaker was only expressing the feelings
of every Dalesman in the room when one night at the Arms he declared
of Owd Bob that to ha run was to ha won At which MAdam sniggered
audibly and winked at Red Wull To ha run was to ha onelickin to
rin next yearll be to

Win next year Tammas interposed dogmatically Onlesswith
shivering sarcasmyou and yer Wullie are thinkin o winnin

The little man rose from his solitary seat at the back of the room and
pattered across Wullie and I are thinkin o t he whispered loudly
in the old mans ear And mair what Adam MAdam and his Red Wull think
o doin that ye may remairk Mr Thornton they do Next year we rin
and next yearwe win Come Wullie well leave em to chew that and
he marched out of the room amid the jeers of the assembled topers

When quiet was restored it was Jim Mason who declared One thing
certain win or no theyll not be far off

     

Meanwhile the summer ended abruptly Hard on the heels of a sweltering
autumn the winter came down In that year the Daleland assumed very
early its white cloak The Silver Mere was soon iceveiled the Wastrel
rolled sullenly down below Kenmuir its creeks and quiet places tented
with jagged sheets of ice while the Scaur and Muir Pike raised hoary
heads against the frosty blue It was the season still remembered in the
North as the White Winterthe worst they say since the famous 1808

For days together Jim Mason was stuck with his bags in the Dalesmans
Daughter and there was no communication between the two Dales On
the Mere Marches the snow massed deep and impassable in thick billowy
drifts In the Devils Bowl men said it lay piled some score feet deep
And sheep seeking shelter in the ghylls and protected spots were
buried and lost in their hundreds

That is the time to test the hearts of shepherds and sheepdogs when
the wind runs icecold across the waste of white and the low woods on
the upland walks shiver black through a veil of snow and sheep must be
found and folded or lost a trial of head as well as heart of resource
as well as resolution

In that winter more than one man and many a dog lost his life in the
quiet performance of his duty gliding to death over the slippery
snowshelves or overwhelmed beneath an avalanche of the warm
suffocating white smoored as they call it Many a deed was done
many a death died recorded only in that Book which holds the names of
thosemen or animals souls or no soulswho tried

They found old Wrottesley the squires head shepherd lying one morning
at Gills foot like a statue in its white bed the snow gently blowing
about the venerable face calm and beautiful in death And stretched
upon his bosom her masters hands blue and stiff still clasped about
her neck his old dog Jess She had huddled there as a last hope to
keep the dear dead master warm her great heart riven hoping where
there was no hope

That night she followed him to herd sheep in a better land Death from
exposure Dingley the vet gave it but as little MAdam his eyes
dimmer than their wont declared huskily We ken better Wullie

Cyril Gilbraith a young man not overburdened with emotions told with
a sob in his voice how at the terrible Rowan Rock Jim Mason had stood
impotent dumb bigeyed watching BetsyBetsy the friend and partner
of the last ten yearsslipping over the icecold surface silently
appealing to the hand that had never failed her beforesliding to
Eternity

In the Daleland that winter the endurance of many a shepherd and his
dog was strained past breakingpoint From the frozen Black Water to
the whitepeaked Grammoch Pike two men only each always with his shaggy
adjutant never owned defeat never turned back never failed in a thing
attempted

In the following spring Mr Tinkerton the squires agent declared
that James Moore and Adam MAdamOwd Bob rather and Red Wullhad
lost between them fewer sheep than any single farmer on the whole March
Mere Estatea proud record

Of the two many a tale was told that winter They were invincible
incomparable worthy antagonists

It was Owd Bob who when he could not drive the band of Black Faces over
the narrow Razorback which led to safety induced them to _follow_ him
across that teninch deathtrack one by one like children behind
their mistress It was Red Wull who was seen coming down the precipitous
Saddlers How shouldering up that grand old gentleman King o the
Dale whose leg was broken

The gray dog it was who found Cyril Gilbraith by the White Stones with
a cigarette and a sprained ankle on the night the whole village was out
with lanterns searching for the wellloved young scapegrace It was the
Tailless Tyke and his master who one bitter evening came upon little
Mrs Burton lying in a huddle beneath the lea of the fastwhitening
Druids Pillar with her latest baby on her breast It was little MAdam
who took off his coat and wrapped the child in it little MAdam who
unwound his plaid threw it like a breastband across the dogs great
chest and tied the ends round the weary womans waist Red Wull it was
who dragged her back to the Sylvester Arms and life straining like a
giant through the snow while his master staggered behind with the babe
in his arms When they reached the inn it was MAdam who with a smile
on his face told the landlord what he thought of him for sending _his_
wife across the Marches on such a day and on his errand To which Id
a cauld pleaded honest Jem

For days together David could not cross the Stony Bottom to Kenmuir
His enforced confinement to the Grange led however to no more frequent
collisions than usual with his father For MAdam and Red Wull were out
at all hours in all weathers night and day toiling at their work of
salvation

At last one afternoon David managed to cross the Bottom at a point
where a fallen thorntree gave him a bridge over the soft snow He
stayed but a little while at Kenmuir yet when he started for home it
was snowing again

By the time he had crossed the icedraped bridge over the Wastrel a
blizzard was raging The wind roared past him smiting him so that he
could barely stand and the snow leaped at him so that he could not see
But he held on doggedly slipping sliding tripping down and up
again with one arm shielding his face On on into the white darkness
blindly on sobbing stumbling dazed

At length nigh dead he reached the brink of the Stony Bottom He
looked up and he looked down but nowhere in that blinding mist could he
see the fallen thorntree He took a step forward into the white morass
and sank up to his thigh He struggled feebly to free himself and sank
deeper The snow wreathed twisting round him like a white flame and
he collapsed softly crying on that soft bed

I cannaI canna he moaned

     

Little Mrs Moore her face whiter and frailer than ever stood at the
window looking out into the storm

I canna rest for thinkin o th lad she said Then turning she saw
her husband his fur cap down over his ears buttoning his pilotcoat
about his throat while Owd Bob stood at his feet waiting

Yere no goin James she asked anxiously

But I am lass he answered and she knew him too well to say more

So those two went quietly out to save life or lose it nor counted the
cost

Down a windshattered slopeover a spar of iceup an eternal hilla
forlorn hope

In a whirlwind chaos of snow the tempest storming at them the white
earth lashing them they fought a good fight In front Owd Bob the
snow clogging his shaggy coat his hair cutting like lashes of steel
across eyes his head lowered as he followed the finger of God and
close behind James Moore his back stern against the storm stalwart
still yet swaying like a tree before the wind

So they battled through to the brink of the Stony Bottomonly to arrive
too late

For just as the Master peering about him had caught sight of a
shapeless lump lying motionless in front there loomed across the
snowchoked gulf through the white riot of the storm a gigantic figure
forging doggedly forward his great head down to meet the hurricane
And close behind buffeted and bruised stiff and staggering a little
dauntless figure holding stubbornly on clutching with one hand at the
gale and a shrill voice whirled away on the trumpet tones of the wind
crying

 Noo Wullie wi me
 Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled
 Scots wham Bruce has often led
 Welcome to 

Here he is Wullie

 or to victorie

The brave little voice died away The quest was over the lost sheep
found And the last James Moore saw of them was the same small gallant
form half carrying half dragging the rescued boy out of the Valley of
the Shadow and away

David was none the worse for his adventure for on reaching home MAdam
produced a familiar bottle

Heres something to warm yer inside andmaking a feint at the strap
on the walls heres something to do the same by yer  But
Wullie oot again

And out they wentunreckoned heroes

     

It was but a week later in the very heart of the bitter time that
there came a day when from gray dawn to grayer eve neither James Moore
nor Owd Bob stirred out into the wintry white And the Masters face was
hard and set as it always was in time of trouble

Outside the wind screamed down the Dale while the snow fell
relentlessly softly fingering the windows blocking the doors and
piling deep against the walls Inside the house there was a strange
quiet no sound save for hushed voices and upstairs the shuffling of
muffled feet

Below all day long Owd Bob patrolled the passage like some silent
gray spectre

Once there came a low knocking at the door and David his face and hair
and cap smothered in the allpervading white came in with an eddy of
snow He patted Owd Bob and moved on tiptoe into the kitchen To him
came Maggie softly shoes in hand with white frightened face The two
whispered anxiously awhile like brother and sister as they were then
the boy crept quietly away only a little pool of water on the floor and
wet treacherous footdabs toward the door testifying to the visitor

Toward evening the wind died down but the mourning flakes still fell

With the darkening of night Owd Bob retreated to the porch and lay down
on his blanket The light from the lamp at the head of the stairs shone
through the crack of open door on his dark head and the eyes that never
slept

The hours passed and the gray knight still kept his vigil Alone in the
darknessalone it almost seemed in the househe watched His head
lay motionless along his paws but the steady gray eyes never flinched
or drooped

Time tramped on on leaden foot and still he waited and ever the pain
of hovering anxiety was stamped deeper in the gray eyes

At length it grew past bearing the hollow stillness of the house
overcame him He rose pushed open the door and softly pattered across
the passage

At the foot of the stairs he halted his forepaws on the first step his
grave face and pleading eyes uplifted as though he were praying The
dim light fell on the raised head and the white escutcheon on his
breast shone out like the snow on Salmon

At length with a sound like a sob he dropped to the ground and stood
listening his tail dropping and head raised Then he turned and began
softly pacing up and down like some velvetfooted sentinel at the gate
of death

Up and down up and down softly as the falling snow for a weary weary
while

Again he stopped and stood listening intently at the foot of the
stairs and his gray coat quivered as though there were a draught

Of a sudden the deathly stillness of the house was broken Upstairs
feet were running hurriedly There was a cry and again silence

A life was coming in a life was going out

The minutes passed hours passed and at the sunless dawn a life
passed

And all through that night of agelong agony the gray figure stood
still as a statue at the foot of the stairs Only when with the first
chill breath of the morning a dry quickquenched sob of a strong man
sorrowing for the helpmeet of a score of years and a tiny cry of a
newborn child wailing because its mother was not came down to his
ears the Gray Watchman dropped his head upon his bosom and with a
little whimpering note crept back to his blanket

A little later the door above opened and James Moore tramped down the
stairs He looked taller and gaunter than his wont but there was no
trace of emotion on his face

At the foot of the stairs Owd Bob stole out to meet him He came
crouching up head and tail down in a manner no man ever saw before or
since At his masters feet he stopped

Then for one short moment James Moores whole face quivered

Well lad he said quite low and his voice broke shes awa

That was all for they were an undemonstrative couple

Then they turned and went out together into the bleak morning




Chapter VIII MADAM AND HIS COAT


To David MAdam the loss of gentle Elizabeth Moore was as real a grief
as to her children Yet he manfully smothered his own aching heart and
devoted himself to comforting the mourners at Kenmuir

In the days succeeding Mrs Moores death the boy recklessly neglected
his duties at the Grange But little MAdam forbore to rebuke him At
times indeed he essayed to be passively kind David however was too
deeply sunk in his great sorrow to note the change

The day of the funeral came The earth was throwing off its icefetters
and the Dale was lost in a mourning mist

In the afternoon MAdam was standing at the window of the kitchen
contemplating the infinite weariness of the scene when the door of the
house opened and shut noiselessly Red Wull raised himself on to the
sill and growled and David hurried past the window making for Kenmuir
MAdam watched the passing figure indifferently then with an angry oath
sprang to the window

Bring me back that coat ye thief he cried tapping fiercely on the
pane Tak it aff at onst ye muckle gowk or Ill come and tear it aff
ye Dye see him Wullie the great coof has ma coatme black coat new
last Michaelmas and it rainin nough to melt it

He threw the window up with a bang and leaned out

Bring it back I tell ye ondootiful or Ill summons ye Though yeve
no respect for me ye might have for ma claithes Yere too big for yer
ain boots let alane ma coat Dye think I had it cut for a elephant
Its burstin I tell ye Tak it aff Fetch it here or Ill een send
Wullie to bring it

David paid no heed except to begin running heavily down the hill The
coat was stretched in wrinkled agony across his back his big red
wrists protruded like shankbones from the sleeves and the little tails
flapped wearily in vain attempts to reach the wearers legs

MAdam bubbling over with indignation scrambled half through the open
window Then tickled at the amazing impudence of the thing he paused
smiled dropped to the ground again and watched the uncouth retreating
figure with chuckling amusement

Did ye ever see the like o that Wullie he muttered Ma puir
coatpuir wee coatie it gars me greet to see her in her pain A mans
coat Wullie is aften unco sma for his sons back and David there
is strainin and stretchin her nigh to brakin for a the world as he
does ma forbearance And whats he care aboot the one or tithernot a
fingerflip

As he stood watching the disappearing figure there began the slow
tolling of the minutebell in the little Dale church Now near now far
now loud now low its dull chant rang out through the mist like the
slowdropping tears of a mourning world

MAdam listened almost reverently as the bell tolled on the only
sound in the quiet Dale Outside a drizzling rain was falling the
snow dribbled down the hill in muddy tricklets and trees and roofs and
windows dripped

And still the bell tolled on calling up relentlessly sad memories of
the long ago

It was on just such another dreary day in just such another December
and not so many years gone by that the light had gone forever out of
his life

The whole picture rose as instant to his eyes as if it had been but
yesterday That insistent bell brought the scene surging back to him
the dismal day the drizzle the few mourners little David decked out
in black his fair hair contrasting with his gloomy clothes his face
swollen with weeping the Dale hushed it seemed in death save for the
tolling of the bell and his love had left him and gone to the happy
land the hymnbooks talk of

Red Wull who had been watching him uneasily now came up and shoved
his muzzle into his masters hand The cold touch brought the little man
back to earth He shook himself turned wearily away from the window
and went to the door of the house

He stood there looking out and all round him was the eternal drip drip
of the thaw The wind lulled and again the minutebell tolled out clear
and inexorable resolute to recall what was and what had been

With a choking gasp the little man turned into the house and ran up the
stairs and into his room He dropped on his knees beside the great chest
in the corner and unlocked the bottom drawer the key turning noisily
in its socket

In the drawer he searched with feverish fingers and produced at length
a little paper packet wrapped about with a stained yellow ribbon It was
the ribbon she had used to weave on Sundays into her soft hair

Inside the packet was a cheap heartshaped frame and in it a
photograph

Up there it was too dark to see The little man ran down the stairs Red
Wull jostling him as he went and hurried to the window in the kitchen

It was a sweet laughing face that looked up at him from the frame
demure yet arch shy yet roguisha face to look at and a face to love

As he looked a wintry smile wholly tender half tearful stole over the
little mans face

Lassie he whispered and his voice was infinitely soft its lang
sin Ive daured look at ye But its no that yere forgotten dearie

Then he covered his eyes with his hand as though he were blinded

Dinna look at me sae lass he cried and fell on his knees kissing
the picture hugging it to him and sobbing passionately

Red Wull came up and pushed his face compassionately into his masters
but the little man shoved him roughly away and the dog retreated into a
corner abashed and reproachful

Memories swarmed back on the little man

It was more than a decade ago now and yet he dared barely think of that
last evening when she had lain so white and still in the little room
above

Pit the bairn on the bed Adam man she had said in low tones Ill
be gaein in a wee while noo Its the lang goodby to youand him

He had done her bidding and lifted David up The tiny boy lay still a
moment looking at this whitefaced mother whom he hardly recognized

Minnie he called piteously Then thrusting a small dirty hand into
his pocket he pulled out a grubby sweet

Minnie ha a sweetieain o Davies sweeties and he held it out
anxiously in his warm plump palm thinking it a certain cure for any
ill

Eat it for mither she said smiling tenderly and then Davie ma
heart Im leavin ye

The boy ceased sucking the sweet and looked at her the corners of his
mouth drooping pitifully

Yere no gaein awa mither he asked his face all working Yell
no leave yen wee laddie

Ay laddie awareet awa HEs callin me She tried to smile but
her mothers heart was near to bursting

Yell tak yen wee Davie wi ye mither the child pleaded crawling up
toward her face

The great tears rolled unrestrained down her wan cheeks and MAdam
at the head of the bed was sobbing openly

Eh ma bairn ma bairn Im sair to leave ye she cried brokenly
Lift him for me Adam

He placed the child in her arms but she was too weak to hold him So he
laid him upon his mothers pillows and the boy wreathed his soft arms
about her neck and sobbed tempestuously

And the two lay thus together

Just before she died Flora turned her head and whispered

Adam ma man yell ha to be mither and father baith to the lad noo
and she looked at him with tender confidence in her dying eyes

I wull afore God as I stan here I wull he declared passionately
Then she died and there was a look of ineffable peace upon her face

     

Mither and father baith

The little man rose to his feet and flung the photograph from him Red
Wull pounced upon it but MAdam leapt at him as he mouthed it

Git awa ye devil he screamed and picking it up stroked it
lovingly with trembling fingers

Maither and father baith

How had he fulfilled his loves last wish How

Oh God and he fell upon his knees at the tableside hugging the
picture sobbing and praying

Red Wull cowered in the far corner of the room and then crept whining
up to where his master knelt But MAdam heeded him not and the great
dog slunk away again

There the little man knelt in the gloom of the winters afternoon a
miserable penitent His grayflecked head was bowed upon his arms his
hands clutched the picture and he prayed aloud in gasping halting
tones

Gie me grace O God Father and mither baith ye said Floraand I
hana done it But tis no too latesay its no lass Tell me theres
time yet and say ye forgie me Ive tried to bear wi him mony and mony
a time But hes vexed me and set himself agin me and stiffened my
back and ye ken hoo I was aye quick to tak offence But Ill mak it
up to himmak it up to him and mair Ill humble masel afore him
and thatll be bitter enough And Ill be father and mither baith to
him But theres bin none to help me and its bin sair wioot ye
And but eh lassie Im wearyin for ye

     

It was a dreary little procession that wound in the drizzle from Kenmuir
to the little Dale Church At the head stalked James Moore and close
behind David in his meagre coat While last of all as if to guide the
stragglers in the weary road come Owd Bob

There was a full congregation in the tiny church now In the squires
pew were Cyril Gilbraith Muriel Sylvester and most conspicuous Lady
Eleanour Her slender figure was simply draped in gray with gray fur
about the neck and gray fur edging sleeves and jacket her veil was
lifted and you could see the soft hair about her temples like waves
breaking on white cliffs and her eyes big with tender sympathy as she
glanced toward the pew upon her right

For there were the mourners from Kenmuir the Master tall grim and
gaunt and beside him Maggie striving to be calm and little Andrew
the miniature of his father

Alone in the pew behind David MAdam in his fathers coat

The back of the church was packed with farmers from the whole March Mere
Estate friends from Silverdale and Grammochtown and nearly every
soul in Wastreldale come to show their sympathy for the living and
reverence for the dead

At last the end came in the wet dreariness of the little churchyard and
slowly the mourners departed until at length were left only the parson
the Master and Owd Bob

The parson was speaking in rough short accents digging nervously
at the wet ground The other tall and gaunt his face drawn and
halfaverted stood listening By his side was Owd Bob scanning his
masters countenance a wistful compassion deep in the sad gray eyes
while close by one of the parsons terriers was nosing inquisitively in
the wet grass

Of a sudden James Moore his face still turned away stretched out a
hand The parson broke off abruptly and grasped it Then the two men
strode away in opposite directions the terrier hopping on three legs
and shaking the rain off his hard coat

     

Davids steps sounded outside MAdam rose from his knees The door of
the house opened and the boys feet shuffled in the passage

David the little man called in a tremulous voice

He stood in the halflight one hand on the table the other clasping
the picture His eyes were bleared his thin hair all tossed and he was
shaking

David he called again Ive somethin I wush to say to ye

The boy burst into the room His face was stained with tears and rain
and the new black coat was wet and slimy all down the front and on the
elbows were greenbrown muddy blots For on his way home he had flung
himself down in the Stony Bottom just as he was heedless of the wet
earth and his fathers coat and lying on his face thinking of
that second mother lost to him had wept his heart out in a storm of
passionate grief

Now he stood defiantly his hand upon the door

What dyo want

The little man looked from him to the picture in his hand

Help me Florahell no he prayed Then raising his eyes he began
Id like to sayIve bin thinkinI think I should tell yeits no
an easy thing for a man to say

He broke off short The selfimposed task was almost more than he could
accomplish

He looked appealingly at David But there was no glimmer of
understanding in that white set countenance

O God its maist mair than I can do the little man muttered and the
perspiration stood upon his forehead Again he began David after I
saw ye this afternoon steppin doon the hill Again he paused His
glance rested unconsciously upon the coat David mistook the look
mistook the dimness in his fathers eyes mistook the tremor in his
voice

Here tis tak yo coat he cried passionately and tearing it off
flung it down at his fathers feet Tak itandandcurse yo

He banged out of the room and ran upstairs and locking himself in
threw himself on to his bed and sobbed

Red Wull made a movement to fly at the retreating figure then turned
to his master his stumptail vibrating with pleasure But little MAdam
was looking at the wet coat now lying in a wet bundle at his feet

Curse ye he repeated softly Curse yeye heard him Wullie

A bitter smile crept across his face He looked again at the picture now
lying crushed in his hand

Ye canna say I didna try ye canna ask me to agin he muttered and
slipped it into his pocket Niver agin Wullie not if the Queen were
to ask it

Then he went out into the gloom and drizzle still smiling the same
bitter smile

     

That night when it came to closingtime at the Sylvester Arms Jem
Burton found a little grayhaired figure lying on the floor in the
taproom At the little mans head lay a great dog

Yo beast said the righteous publican regarding the figure of his
best customer with fine scorn Then catching sight of a photograph in
the little mans hand

Oh yore that sort are yo foxy he leered Gie us a look at er
and he tried to disengage the picture from the others grasp But at
the attempt the great dog rose bared his teeth and assumed such a
diabolical expression that the big landlord retreated hurriedly behind
the bar

Two on ye he shouted viciously rattling his heels beasts baith




PART III THE SHEPHERDS TROPHY




Chapter IX RIVALS


MADAM never forgave his son After the scene on the evening of the
funeral there could be no alternative but war for all time The
little man had attempted to humble himself and been rejected and
the bitterness of defeat when he had deserved victory rankled like a
poisoned barb in his bosom

Yet the heat of his indignation was directed not against David but
against the Master of Kenmuir To the influence and agency of James
Moore he attributed his discomfiture and bore himself accordingly In
public or in private in taproom or market he never wearied of abusing
his enemy

Feel the loss o his wife dye say he would cry Ay as muckle as
I feel the loss o my hair James Moore can feel naethin I tell ye
except aiblins a mischance to his meeserable dog

When the two met as they often must it was always MAdams endeavor
to betray his enemy into an unworthy expression of feeling But James
Moore sorely tried as he often was never gave way He met the little
mans sneers with a quelling silence looking down on his asptongued
antagonist with such a contempt flashing from his bluegray eyes as hurt
his adversary more than words

Only once was he spurred into reply It was in the taproom of
the Dalesmans Daughter on the occasion of the big spring fair in
Grammochtown when there was a goodly gathering of farmers and their
dogs in the room

MAdam was standing at the fireplace with Red Wull at his side

Its a noble pairt ye play James Moore he cried loudly across the
room settin son against father and dividin hoose against hoose
Its worthy o ye we yer churchgoin and yer psalmsingin and yer
godliness

The Master looked up from the far end of the room

Happen yore not aware MAdam he said sternly that an it had not
bin for me Davidd ha left you years agoneand twould nobbut ha
served yo right Im thinkin

The little man was beaten on his own ground so he changed front

Dinna shout so manI have ears to hear Forbye ye irritate Wullie

The Tailless Tyke indeed had advanced from the fireplace and now
stood huge and hideous in the very centre of the room There was
distant thunder in his throat a threat upon his face a challenge in
every wrinkle And the Gray Dog stole gladly out from behind his master
to take up the gage of battle

Straightway there was silence tongues ceased to wag tankards to clink
Every man and every dog was quietly gathering about those two central
figures Not one of them all but had his score to wipe off against the
Tailless Tyke not one of them but was burning to join in the battle
once begun And the two gladiators stood looking past one another
muzzle to muzzle each with a tiny flash of teeth glinting between his
lips

But the fight was not to be for the twentieth time the Master
intervened

Bob lad coom in he called and bending grasped his favorite by
the neck

MAdam laughed softly

Wullie Wullie to me he cried The look o yous enough for that
gentleman

If they get fightin itll no be Bob here Ill hit I warn yo
MAdam said the Master grimly

Gin ye sae muckle as touched Wullie dye ken what Id do James Moore
asked the little man very smoothly

Yessweer the other replied and strode out of the room amid a roar
of derisive laughter at MAdams expense

Owd Bob had now attained wellnigh the perfection of his art Parson
Leggy declared roundly that his like had not been seen since the days
of Rex son of Rally Among the Dalesmen he was a heroic favorite his
prowess and gentle ways winning him friends on every hand But the point
that told most heavily for him was that in all things he was the very
antithesis of Red Wull

Barely a man in the countryside but owed that ferocious savage a
grudge not a man of them all who dared pay it Once Long Kirby full
of beer and valor tried to settle his account Coming on MAdam and Red
Wull as he was driving into Grammochtown he leant over and with his
thong dealt the dog a terrible swordlike slash that raised an angry
ridge of red from hip to shoulder and was twenty yards down the road
before the little mans shrill curse reached his ear drowned in a
hideous bellow

He stood up and lashed the colt who quick on his legs for a young un
soon settled to his gallop But glancing over his shoulder he saw a
hounding form behind catching him as though he were walking His face
turned sickly white he screamed he flogged he looked back Right
beneath the tailboard was the red devil in the dust while racing a
furlong behind on the turnpike road was the mad figure of MAdam

The smith struck back and flogged forward It was of no avail With a
tigerlike bound the murderous brute leapt on the flying trap At the
shock of the great body the colt was thrown violently on his side Kirby
was tossed over the hedge and Red Wull pinned beneath the debris

MAdam had time to rush up and save a tragedy

Ive a mind to knife ye Kirby he panted as he bandaged the smiths
broken head

After that you may be sure the Dalesmen preferred to swallow insults
rather than to risk their lives and their impotence only served to fan
their hatred to white heat

The working methods of the antagonists were as contrasted as their
appearances In a word the one compelled where the other coaxed

His enemies said the Tailless Tyke was rough not even Tammas denied he
was ready His brain was as big as his body and he used them both
to some purpose As quick as a cat with the heart of a lion and the
temper of Nicks self was Parson Leggys description

What determination could effect that could Red Wall but achievement
by inactionsupremest of all strategieswas not for him In matters of
the subtlest handling where to act anything except indifference was
to lose with sheep restless fearful forebodings hymned to them by the
wind panic hovering unseen above them when an illconsidered movement
spelt catastrophethen was Owd Bob o Kenmuir incomparable

Men still tell how when the squires new thrashingmachine ran amuck
in Grammochtown and for some minutes the market square was a turbulent
sea of blaspheming men yelping dogs and stampeding sheep only one
flock stood calm as a millpond by the bullring watching the riot with
almost indifference And in front sitting between them and the storm
was a quiet gray dog his mouth stretched in a capacious yawn to yawn
was to win and he won

When the worst of the uproar was over many a glance of triumph was shot
first at that one still pack and then at MAdam as he waded through
the disorder of huddling sheep

And wheers your Wullie noo asked Tapper scornfully

Weel the little man answered with a quiet smile at this minute hes
killin your Rasper doon by the pump Which was indeed the case for
big blue Rasper had interfered with the great dog in the performance of
his duty and suffered accordingly

     

Spring passed into summer and the excitement as to the event of the
approaching Trials when at length the rivals would be pitted
against one another reached such a height as old Jonas Maddox the
octogenarian could hardly recall

Down in the Sylvester Arms there was almost nightly a conflict
between MAdam and Tammas Thornton spokesman of the Dales men Many a
longdrawn bout of words had the two anent the respective merits and Cup
chances of red and gray In these duels Tammas was usually worsted His
temper would get the better of his discretion and the cynical debater
would be lost in the hottongued partisan

During these encounters the others would as a rule maintain a rigid
silence Only when their champion was being beaten and it was time for
strength of voice to vanquish strength of argument they joined in
right lustily and roared the little man down for all the world like the
gentlemen who rule the Empire at Westminster

Tammas was an easy subject for MAdam to draw but David was an easier
Insults directed at himself the boy bore with a stolidity born of long
use But a poisonous dart shot against his friends at Kenmuir never
failed to achieve its object And the little man evinced an amazing
talent for the concoction of deft lies respecting James Moore

Im hearin said he one evening sitting in the kitchen sucking his
twig Im hearin James Moore is gaein to git married agin

Yore hearin liesor mairlike tellin em David answered shortly
For he treated his father now with contemptuous indifference

Seven months sin his wife died the little man continued
meditatively Weel Im ony stonished hes waited sae lang Ain
buried anither come onthats James Moore

David burst angrily out of the room

Gaein to ask him if its true called his father after him Gude
luck to yeand him

David had now a new interest at Kenmuir In Maggie he found an endless
source of study On the death of her mother the girl had taken up the
reins of government at Kenmuir and gallantly she played her part
whether in tenderly mothering the baby wee Anne or in the sterner
matters of household work She did her duty young though she was
with a surprising oldfashioned womanliness that won many a smile
of approval from her father and caused Davids eyes to open with
astonishment

And he soon discovered that Maggie mistress of Kenmuir was another
person from his erstwhile playfellow and servant

The happy days when might ruled right were gone never to be recalled
David often regretted them especially when in a conflict of tongues
Maggie with her quick answers and teasing eyes was driving him sulky
and vanquished from the field The two were perpetually squabbling now
In the good old days he remembered bitterly squabbles between them
were unknown He had never permitted them any attempt at independent
thought or action was as sternly quelled as in the Middle Ages She must
follow where he led onMa word

Now she was mistress where he had been master hers was to command his
to obey In consequence they were perpetually at war And yet he would
sit for hours in the kitchen and watch her as she went about her
business with solemn interested eyes half of admiration half of
amusement In the end Maggie always turned on him with a little laugh
touched with irritation

Hant yo got nothin bettern that to do nor lookin at me she
asked one Saturday about a month before Cup Day

No I hant the pert fellow rejoined

Then I wish yo had It maks me fair jumpety yo watchin me so like
ony cat a mouse

Niver yo fash yosel account o me ma wench he answered calmly

Yo wench indeed she cried tossing her head

Ay or will be he muttered

Whats that she cried springing round a flush of color on her face

Nowt my dear Yoll know so soon as I want yo to yo may be sure
and no sooner

The girl resumed her baking half angry half suspicious

I dunno what yo mean Mr MAdam she said

Dont yo Mrs MA

The rest was lost in the crash of a falling plate whereat David laughed
quietly and asked if he should help pick up the bits

     

On the same evening at the Sylvester Arms an announcement was made that
knocked the breath out of its hearers

In the debate that night on the fastapproaching Dale Trials and the
relative abilities of red and gray MAdam on the one side and Tammas
backed by Long Kirby and the rest on the other had cudgelled each
other with more than usual vigor The controversy rose to feverheat
abuse succeeded argument and the little man again and again was hooted
into silence

Its easy laffin he cried at last but yell laff tither side o
yer ugly faces on Cup Day

Will us indeed Usll see came the derisive chorus

Well whip ye till yere deaf dumb and blind Wullie and I

Yoll not

We will

The voices were rising like the east wind in March

Yoll not and for a very good reason too asseverated Tammas loudly

Gie us yer reason ye muckle liar cried the little man turning on
him

Becos began Jim Mason and stopped to rub his nose

Yo old yo noise Jim recommended Rob Saunderson

Becos it was Tammas this time who paused

Git on wi it ye stammerin stirk cried MAdam Why

BecosOwd Bobll not rin

Tammas sat back in his chair

What screamed the little man thrusting forward

Whats that yelled Long Kirby leaping to his feet

Mon say it agin shouted Rob

Whats owd addled eggs tellin cried Liz Burton

Dang his ead for him shouts Tupper

Fill his eye says Ned Hoppin

They jostled round the old mans chair MAdam in front Jem Burton and
Long Kirby leaning over his shoulder Liz behind her father Saunderson
and Tupper tackling him on either side while the rest peered and
elbowed in the rear

The announcement had fallen like a thunderbolt among them

Tammas looked slowly up at the little mob of eager faces above him
Pride at the sensation caused by his news struggled in his countenance
with genuine sorrow for the matter of it

Ay yo may well earken all on yo Tis enough to mak the deadies
listen I says agin Wesll no rin oor Bob fot Cup And yo may guess
why Baint every mon Mr MAdam asd pit aside his chanst o the Cup
and that maist a gift for himMAdams tongue was in his cheekand
it a certainty the old man continued warmly oot o respect for his
wifes memory

The news was received in utter silence The shock of the surprise
coupled with the bitterness of the disappointment froze the slow
tongues of his listeners

Only one small voice broke the stillness

Oh the feelin man He should git a reduction o rent for sic a
display o proper speerit Ill mind Mr Hornbut to let auld Sylvester
ken ot

Which he did and would have got a thrashing for his pains had not Cyril
Gilbraith thrown him out of the parsonage before the angry cleric could
lay hands upon him




Chapter X RED WULL WINS


TAMMAS had but told the melancholy truth Owd Bob was not to run for the
cup And this selfdenying ordinance speaks more for James Moores love
of his lost wife than many a lordly cenotaph

To the people of the Daleland from the Black Water to the marketcross
in Grammochtown the news came with the shock of a sudden blow They
had set their hearts on the Gray Dogs success and had felt serenely
confident of his victory But the sting of the matter lay in this that
now the Tailless Tyke might well win

MAdam on the other hand was plunged into a fervor of delight at the
news For to win the Shepherds Trophy was the goal of his ambition
David was now less than nothing to the lonely little man Red Wull
everything to him And to have that name handed down to posterity
gallantly holding its place among those of the most famous sheepdogs of
all time was his hearts desire

As Cup Day drew near the little man his finedrawn temperament
strung to the highest pitch of nervousness was tossed on a sea of
apprehension His hopes and fears ebbed and flowed on the tide of the
moment His moods were as uncertain as the winds in March and there was
no dependence on his humor for a unit of time At one minute he paced up
and down the kitchen his face already flushed with the glow of victory
chanting

Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled

At the next he was down at the table his head buried in his hands his
whole figure shaking as he cried in choking voice Eh Wullie Wullie
theyre all agin us

David found that life with his father now was life with an unamiable
hornet Careless as he affected to be of his fathers vagaries he was
tried almost to madness and fled away at every moment to Kenmuir for
as he told Maggie Id sooner put up wi your hairs and himperences
miss than wi him the wemon that he be

     

At length the great day came Fears hopes doubts dismays all
dispersed in the presence of the reality

Cup Day is always a general holiday in the Daleland and every soul
crowds over to Silverdale Shops were shut special trains ran in
to Grammochtown and the road from the little town was dazed with
charabancs brakes wagonettes carriages carts footpassengers
wending toward the Dalesmans Daughter

And soon the paddock below that little inn was humming with the crowd
of sportsmen and spectators come to see the battle for the Shepherds
Trophy

There very noticeable with its red body and yellow wheels was the
great Kenmuir wagon Many an eye was directed on the handsome young pair
who stood in it conspicuous and unconscious above the crowd Maggie
looking in her simple print frock as sweet and fresh as any mountain
flower while Davids fair face was all gloomy and his brows knit

In front of the wagon was a black cluster of Dalesmen discussing
MAdams chances In the centre was Tammas holding forth Had you passed
close to the group you might have heard A man dyo say Mr Maddox A
hape I call him or A dog more like an og I tell yo Round the
old orator were Jonas Enry and oor Job Jem Burton Rob Saunderson
Tupper Jim Mason Hoppin and others while on the outskirts stood
Saml Todd prophesying rain and MAdams victory Close at hand Bessie
Bolstock who was reputed to have designs on David was giggling
spitefully at the pair in the Kenmuir wagon and singing

Let a lad aloan lass Let a lad abe

While her father Teddy dodged in and out among the crowd with tray and
glasses for Cup Day was the great day of the year for him

Past the group of Dalesmen and on all sides was a mass of bobbing
headsScots Northerners Yorkshiremen Taffies To right and left
a long array of carriages and carts ranging from the squires quiet
landau and Viscount Birdsayes gorgeous barouche to Liz Burtons
threelegged mokecart with little Mrs Burton the twins young Jake
who should have walked and Monkey ditto packed away inside Beyond
the Silver Lea the gaunt Scaur raised its craggy peak and the Pass
trending along its side shone white in the sunshine

At the back of the carriages were booths cocoanutshies Aunt Sallies
shows bookmakers stools and all the panoply of such a meeting
Here Master Launcelot Bilks and Jacky Sylvester were fighting Cyril
Gilbraith was offering to take on the boxing man Long Kirby was
snapping up the odds against Red Wull and Liz Burton and young Ned
Hoppin were being photographed together while Melia Ross in the
background was pretending she didnt care

On the far bank of the stream was a little bevy of men and dogs
observed of all

The Juvenile Stakes had been run and won Londesleys Lassie had carried
off the Locals and the fight for the Shepherds Trophy was about to
begin

Yore not lookin at me noo whispered Maggie to the silent boy by her
side

Nay nor niver dont wush to agin David answered roughly His gaze
was directed over the array of heads in front to where beyond the
Silver Lea a group of shepherds and their dogs was clustered While
standing apart from the rest in characteristic isolation was the bent
figure of his father and beside him the Tailless Tyke

Doesto not want yo feyther to win asked Maggie softly following
his gaze

Im prayin hell be beat the boy answered moodily

Eh Davie hoo can ye cried the girl shocked

Its easy to say Eh David he snapped But if yo lived along
o them two he nodded toward the streamappen yod understand a
bit Eh David indeed I never did

I know it lad she said tenderly and he was appeased

Hed give his right hand for his blessd Wullie to win Id give me
right arm to see him beat And oor Bob there all the whilehe
nodded to the far left of the line where stood James Moore and Owd Bob
with Parson Leggy and the Squire

When at length Red Wull came out to run his course he worked with the
savage dash that always characterized him His method was his own but
the work was admirably done

Keeps right on the back of his sheep said the parson watching
intently Strange thing they dont break But they didnt There was
no waiting no coaxing it was drive and devilry all through He
brought his sheep along at a terrific rate never missing a turn never
faltering never running out And the crowd applauded for the crowd
loves a dashing display While little MAdam hopping agilely about
his face ablaze with excitement handled dog and sheep with a masterly
precision that compelled the admiration even of his enemies

MAdam wins roared a bookmaker Twelve to one agin the field

He wins dang him said David low

Wull wins said the parson shutting his lips

And deserves too said James Moore

Wull wins softly cried the crowd

We dont said Saml gloomily

And in the end Red Wull did Win and there were none save Tammas the
bigot and Long Kirby who had lost a good deal of his wifes money and
a little of his own to challenge the justice of the verdict

The win had but a chilling reception At first there was faint cheering
but it sounded like the echo of an echo and soon died of inanition
To get up an ovation there must be money at the back or a few roaring
fanatics to lead the dance Here there was neither ugly stories
disparaging remarks on every hand And the hundreds who did not know
took their tone as always from those who said they did

MAdam could but remark the absence of enthusiasm as he pushed up
through the throng toward the committee tent No single voice hailed
him victor no friendly hand smote its congratulations Broad backs were
turned contemptuous glances levelled spiteful remarks shot Only the
foreign element looked curiously at the little bent figure with the
glowing face and shrank back at the size and savage aspect of the great
dog at his heels

But what cared he His Wullie was acknowledged champion the best
sheepdog of the year and the little man was happy They could turn
their backs on him but they could not alter that and he could afford
to be indifferent They dinna like it ladhe he But theyll een
ha to thole it Yeve won it Wulliewon it fair

He elbowed through the press making for the ropeguarded inclosure in
front of the committee tent round which the people were now packing In
the door of the tent stood the secretary various stewards and members
of the committee In front alone in the ropedoff space was Lady
Eleanour fragile dainty graceful waiting with a smile upon her face
to receive the winner And on a table beside her naked and dignified
the Shepherds Trophy

There it stood kingly and impressive its fair white sides inscribed
with many names cradled in three shepherds crooks and on the top as
if to guard the Cups contents an exquisitely carved collies head The
Shepherds Trophy the goal of his lifes race and many another mans

He climbed over the rope followed by Red Wull and took off his hat
with almost courtly deference to the fair lady before him

As he walked up to the table on which the Cup stood a shrill voice
easily recognizable broke the silence

Youd like it better if twas full and yo could swim in it you and
yer Wullie it called Whereat the crowd giggled and Lady Eleanour
looked indignant

The little man turned

Ill mind drink yer health Mr Thornton never fear though I ken yed
prefaire to drink yer ain he said At which the crowd giggled afresh
and a gray head at the back which had hoped itself unrecognized
disappeared suddenly

The little man stood there in the stillness sourly smiling his face
still wet from his exertions while the Tailless Tyke at his side
fronted defiantly the serried ring of onlookers a white fence of teeth
faintly visible between his lips

Lady Eleanour looked uneasy Usually the lucky winner was unable to
hear her little speech as she gave the Cup away so deafening was the
applause Now there was utter silence She glanced up at the crowd but
there was no response to her unspoken appeal in that forest of hostile
faces And her gentle heart bled for the forlorn little man before her
To make it up she smiled on him so sweetly as to more than compensate
him

Im sure you deserve your success Mr MAdam she said You and Red
Wull there worked splendidlyeverybody says so

Ive heard naethin ot the little man answered dryly At which some
one in the crowd sniggered

And we all know what a grand dog he is thoughwith a reproving smile
as she glanced at Red Wulls square truncated sternhes not very
polite

His heart is good your Leddyship if his manners are not MAdam
answered smiling

Liar came a loud voice in the silence Lady Eleanour looked up hot
with indignation and half rose from her seat But MAdam merely smiled

Wullie turn and mak yer bow to the leddy he said Theyll no hurt
us noo were up its when were doon theyll flock like corbies to the
carrion

At that Red Wull walked up to Lady Eleanour faintly wagging his tail
and she put her hand on his huge bull head and said Dear old Ugly at
which the crowd cheered in earnest

After that for some moments the only sound was the gentle ripple of
the good ladys voice and the little mans caustic replies

Why last winter the country was full of Red Wulls doings and yours
It was always MAdam and his Red Wull have done this and that and the
other I declare I got quite tired of you both I heard such a lot about
you

The little man cap in hand smiled blushed and looked genuinely
pleased

And when it wasnt you it was Mr Moore and Owd Bob

Owd Bob bless him called a stentorian voice There cheers for oor
Bob

Ip ip ooray It was taken up gallantly and cast from mouth
to mouth and strangers though they did not understand caught the
contagion and cheered too and the uproar continued for some minutes

When it was ended Lady Eleanour was standing up a faint flush on her
cheeks and her eyes flashing dangerously like a queen at bay

Yes she cried and her clear voice thrilled through the air like a
trumpet Yes and now three cheers for Mr MAdam and his Red Wull
Hip hip

Hooray A little knowt of stalwarts at the backJames Moore
Parson Leggy Jim Mason and you may be sure in heart at least Owd
Bobresponded to the call right lustily The crowd joined in and once
off cheered and cheered again

Three cheers more for Mr MAdam

But the little man waved to them

Dinna be bigger heepocrites than ye can help he said Yeve done
enough for one day and thank ye for it

Then Lady Eleanour handed him the Cup

Mr MAdam I present you with the Champion Challenge Dale Cup open to
all comers Keep it guard it love it as your own and win it again if
you can Twice more and its yours you know and it will stop forever
beneath the shadow of the Pike And the right place for it say Ithe
Dale Cup for Dalesmen

The little man took the Cup tenderly

It shall no leave the Estate or ma hoose yer Leddyship gin Wullie and
I can help it he said emphatically

Lady Eleanour retreated into the tent and the crowd swarmed over the
ropes and round the little man who held the Cup beneath his arm

Long Kirby laid irreverent hands upon it

Dinna finger it ordered MAdam

Shall

Shant Wullie keep him aff Which the great dog proceeded to do amid
the laughter of the onlookers

Among the last James Moore was borne past the little man At sight of
him MAdams face assumed an expression of intense concern

Man Moore he cried peering forward as though in alarm man Moore
yere greenpositeevely verdant Are ye in pain Then catching sight
of Owd Bob he started back in affected horror

And ma certes sos yer dog Yer dog as was gray is green Oh guid
life and he made as though about to fall fainting to the ground

Then in bantering tones Ah but ye shouldna covet 

Hell ha no need to covet it long I can tell yo interposed
Tammass shrill accents

And why for no

Becos next year hell win it fra yo Oor Bobll win it little mon
Why thots why

The retort was greeted with a yell of applause from the sprinkling of
Dalesmen in the crowd

But MAdam swaggered away into the tent his head up the Cup beneath
his arm and Red Wull guarding his rear

First of a yell ha to beat Adam MAdam and his Red Wull he cried

MADAMS pride in the great Cup that now graced his kitchen was supreme
It stood alone in the very centre of the mantelpiece just below the old
bellmouthed blunderbuss that hung upon the wall The only ornament in
the bare room it shone out in its silvery chastity like the moon in a
gloomy sky

For once the little man was content Since his mothers death David had
never known such peace It was not that his father became actively kind
rather that he forgot to be actively unkind

Not as I care a brazen button one way or tither the boy informed
Maggie

Then yo should that proper little person replied

MAdam was indeed a changed being He forgot to curse James Moore he
forgot to sneer at Owd Bob he rarely visited the Sylvester Arms to the
detriment of Jem Burtons pocket and temper and he was never drunk

Soaks isseif at home instead suggested Tammas the prejudiced But
the accusation was untrue

Too drunk to git so far said Long Kirby kindly man

I reckn the Cup is kind o company to him said Jim Mason Happen
its lonesomeness as drives him here so much And happen you were
right charitable Jim

Best mak maist on it while he has it cos hell not have it for
long Tammas remarked amid applause

Even Parson Leggy allowedrather reluctantly indeed for he was but
humanthat the little man was changed wonderfully for the better

But I am afraid it may not last he said We shall see what happens
when Owd Bob beats him for the Cup as he certainly will Thatll be the
critical moment

As things were the little man spent all his spare moments with the Cup
between his knees burnishing it and crooning to Wullie

 I never saw a fairer
 I never loed a dearer
 And neist my heart Ill wear her
 For fear my jewel tine

There Wullie look at her is she no bonnie She shines like a
twinkletwinkle in the sky And he would hold it out at arms length
his head cocked sideways the better to scan its bright beauties

The little man was very jealous for his treasure David might not touch
it might not smoke in the kitchen lest the fumes should tarnish its
glory while if he approached too closely he was ordered abruptly away

As if I wanted to touch his nasty Cup he complained to Maggie Id
sooner ony day

Hands aff Mr David immediate she cried indignantly Pertinence
indeed as she tossed her head clear of the big fingers that were
fondling her pretty hair

So it was that MAdam on coming quietly into the kitchen one day
was consumed with angry resentment to find David actually handling
the object of his reverence and the manner of his doing it added a
thousandfold to the offence

The boy was lolling indolently against the mantelpiece his fair head
shoved right into the Cup his breath dimming its lustre and his two
hands big and dirty slowly revolving it before his eyes

Bursting with indignation the little man crept up behind the boy David
was reading through the long list of winners

Theers the first on em he muttered shooting out his tongue to
indicate the locality Andrew Moores Rough 178 And theer agin
James Moores Pinch 179 And aginBeck 182 Ah and theers
im Tammas tells on Rex 183 and Rex 183 Ay but he was a
rare un by all tellins If hed nobbut won but onst agin Ah and
theers none like the Gray Dogsthey all says that and I say so
masel none like the Gray Dogs o Kenmuir bless em And well win
agin too he broke off short his eye had travelled down to the last
name on the list

MAdams Wull he read with unspeakable contempt and put his great
thumb across the name as though to wipe it out MAdams Wull Goo
gracious sakes Phghrr and he made a motion as though to spit
upon the ground

But a little shoulder was into his side two small fists were beating
at his chest and a shrill voice was yelling Devil devil stan
awaand he was tumbled precipitately away from the mantelpiece and
brought up abruptly against the sidewall

The precious Cup swayed on its ebony stand the boys hands rudely
withdrawn almost overthrowing it But the little mans first impulse
cursing and screaming though he was was to steady it

MAdams Wull I wish he was here to teach ye ye snodfaced
oxlimbed profleegit he cried standing in front of the Cup his eyes
blazing

Ay MAdams Wull And why not MAdams Wull Ha ye ony objections
to the name

I didnt know yo was theer said David a thought sheepishly

Na or yed not ha said it

Id ha thought it though muttered the boy

Luckily however his father did not hear He stretched his hands up
tenderly for the Cup lifted it down and began reverently to polish the
dimmed sides with his handkerchief

Yere thinkin nae doot he cried casting up a vicious glance at
David that Wullies no gude enough to ha his name alangside o
they cursed Gray Dogs Are ye no Lets ha the truth for aincefor a
diversion

Reckn hes good enough if theres none better David replied
dispassionately

And wha should there be better Tell me that ye muckle gowk

David smiled

Eh but thatd be long tellin he said

And what wad ye mean by that his father cried

Nay I was but thinkin that Mr Moores Bobll look gradely writ under
yon He pointed to the vacant space below Red Wulls name

The little man put the Cup back on its pedestal with hurried hands The
handkerchief dropped unconsidered to the floor he turned and sprang
furiously at the boy who stood against the wall still smiling and
seizing him by the collar of his coat shook him to and fro with fiery
energy

So yere hopin prayin nae doot that James Moorecurse himwill
win ma Cup awa from me yer ain dad I wonder yere no shamed to crass
ma door Ye live on me ye suck ma blood ye foulmouthed leech Wullie
and me brak oorsels to keep ye in hoose and hameand whats yer
gratitude Ye plot to rob us of oor rights

He dropped the boys coat and stood back

No rights about it said David still keeping his temper

If I win is it no ma right as muckle as ony Englishmans

Red Wull who had heard the rising voices came trotting in scowled at
David and took his stand beside his master

Ah _if_ yo win it said David with significant emphasis on the
conjunction

And whas to beat us

David looked at his father in wellaffected surprise

I tell yo Owd Bobs rinin he answered

And what if he is the other cried

Why even yo should know so much the boy sneered

The little man could not fail to understand

So thats it he said Then in a scream with one finger pointing to
the great dog And what o him Whatll ma Wullie be doin the while
Tell me that and ha a care Mind ye he stans here hearkenin And
indeed the Tailless Tyke was bristling for battle

David did not like the look of things and edged away toward the door

Whatll Wullie be doin ye chickenhearted brock his father cried

Im said the boy now close on the door Im he said with a slow
contempt that made the red bristles quiver on the dogs neck Lookin
on I should thinklookin on What else is he fit for I tell yo oor
Bob

Oor Bob screamed the little man darting forward Oor Bob Hark
to him Ill oor At him Wullie at him

But the Tailless Tyke needed no encouragement With a harsh roar he
sprang through the air only to crash against the closing door

The outer door banged and in another second a mocking finger tapped on
the windowpane

Better luck to the two on yo next time laughed a scornful voice and
David ran down the hill toward Kenmuir




Chapter XII HOW RED WULL HELD THE BRIDGE


FROM that hour the fire of MAdams jealousy blazed into a mighty flame
The winning of the Dale Cup had become a mania with him He had won it
once and would again despite all the Moores all the Gray Dogs all the
undutiful sons in existence on that point he was resolved The fact of
his having tasted the joys of victory served to whet his desire And now
he felt he could never be happy till the Cup was his ownwon outright

At home David might barely enter the room There the trophy stood

Ill not ha ye touch ma Cup ye dirtyfingered illbegotten wastrel
Wullie and me won ityoud naught to do wi it Go you to James Moore
and James Moores dog

Ay and shall I tak Cup wi me or will ye bide till its took from
ye

So the two went on and every day the tension approached nearer
breakingpoint

In the Dale the little man met with no sympathy The hearts of the
Dalesmen were to a man with Owd Bob and his master

Whereas once at the Sylvester Arms his shrill ill tongue had been
rarely still now he maintained a sullen silence Jem Burton at least
had no cause of complaint Crouched away in a corner with Red Wull
beside him the little man would sit watching and listening as the
Dalesmen talked of Owd Bobs doings his staunchness sagacity and
coming victory

Sometimes he could restrain himself no longer Then he would spring
to his feet and stand a little swaying figure and denounce them
passionately in almost pathetic eloquence These orations always
concluded in set fashion

Yere all agin us the little man would cry in quivering voice

We are that Tammas would answer complacently

Fair means or foul yere content sae lang as Wullie and me are beat
I wonder ye dinna poison hima little arsenic and the ways clear for
your Bob

The way is clear enough wioot that from Tammas caustically

Then a lengthy silence only broken by that exceeding bitter cry Eh
Wullie Wullie theyre all agin us

     

And always the rivalsred and graywent about seeking their
opportunity But the Master with his commanding presence and stern
eyes was ever ready for them Toward the end MAdam silent and
sneering would secretly urge on Red Wull to the attack until one day
in Grammochtown James Moore turned on him his blue eyes glittering
Dyo think yo little fule he cried in that hard voice of his
that onst they got set we should iver git either of them off alive It
seemed to strike the little man as a novel idea for from that moment
he was ever the first in his feverish endeavors to oppose his small
form bufferlike between the wouldbe combatants

     

Curse as MAdam might threaten as he might when the time came Owd Bob
won

The styles of the rivals were well contrasted the patience the
insinuating eloquence combined with the splendid dash of the one and
the fierce driving fury of the other

The issue was never in doubt It may have been that the temper of the
Tailless Tyke gave in the time of trial it may have been that his sheep
were wild as MAdam declared certainly not as the little man alleged
in choking voice that they had been chosen and purposely set aside to
ruin his chance Certain it is that his tactics scared them hopelessly
and he never had them in hand

Act for Owd Bob his dropping his driving his penning aroused the
loudtongued admiration of crowd and competitors alike He was patient
yet persistent quiet yet firm and seemed to coax his charges in the
right way in that inimitable manner of his own

When at length the verdict was given and it was known that after
an interval of half a century the Shepherds Trophy was won again by a
Gray Dog of Kenmuir there was such a scene as has been rarely witnessed
on the slope behind the Dalesmans Daughter

Great fists were slapped on mighty backs great feet were stamped on the
sundried banks of the Silver Lea stalwart lungs were strained to their
uttermost capacity and roars of Moore Owd Bob o Kenmuir The
Gray Dogs thundered up the hillside and were flung thundering back

Even James Moore was visibly moved as he worked his way through the
cheering mob and Owd Bob trotting alongside him in quiet dignity
seemed to wave his silvery brush in acknowledgment

Master Jacky Sylvester alternately turned cartwheels and felled the
Hon Launcelot Bilks to the ground Lady Eleanour her cheeks flushed
with pleasure waved her parasol and attempted to restrain her sons
exuberance Parson Leggy danced an unclerical jig and shook hands with
the squire till both those fine old gentlemen were purple in the face
Long Kirby selected a small man in the crowd and bashed his hat down
over his eyes While Tammas Rob Saunderson Tupper Hoppin Londesley
and the rest joined hands and went raving round like so many giddy
girls

Of them all however none was so uproarious in the mad heat of his
enthusiasm as David MAdam He stood in the Kenmuir wagon beside Maggie
a conspicuous figure above the crowd as he roared in hoarse ecstasy

Weel done oor Bob Weel done Mr Moore Yove knocked him Knock him
agin Owd Bob o Kenmuir Moore Moore o Kenmuir Hip Hip until the
noisy young giant attracted such attention in his boisterous delight
that Maggie had to lay a hand upon his arm to restrain his violence

Alone on the far bank of the stream stood the vanquished pair

The little man was trembling slightly his face was still hot from his
exertions and as he listened to the ovation accorded to his conqueror
there was a piteous set grin upon his face In front stood the defeated
dog his lips wrinkling and hackles rising as he too saw and heard
and understood

Its a gran thing to ha a dutiful son Wullie the little man
whispered watching Davids waving figure Hes happyand so are they
anot sae much that James Moore has won as that you and I are beat

Then breaking down for a moment

Eh Wullie Wullie Theyre all agin us Its you and I alane lad

Again seeing the squire followed by Parson Leggy Viscount Birdsaye
and others of the gentry forcing their way through the press to shake
hands with the victor he continued

Its good to be in wi the quality Wullie Niver mak a friend of a
man beneath ye in rank nor an enemy of a man aboon ye thats a soond
principle Wullie if yed get on in honest England

He stood there alone with his dog watching the crowd on the far slope
as it surged upward in the direction of the committee tent Only when
the black mass had packed itself in solid phalanges about that
ring inside which just a year ago he had stood in very different
circumstances and was at length still a wintry smile played for a
moment about his lips He laughed a mirthless laugh

 Bide a wee Wulliehe he Bide a wee
 The bestlaid schemes o mice and men
 Gang aft agley

As he spoke there came down to him above the tumult a faint cry of
mingled surprise and anger The cheering ceased abruptly There was
silence then there burst on the stillness a hurricane of indignation

The crowd surged forward then turned Every eye was directed across the
stream A hundred damning fingers pointed at the solitary figure there
There were hoarse yells of There he be Yons him Whats he done wi
it Thief Throttle him

The mob came lumbering down the slope like one man thundering their
imprecations on a thousand throats They looked dangerous and their
wrath was stimulated by the knot of angry Dalesmen who led the van
There was more than one white face among the women at the top of the
slope as they watched the crowd blundering blindly down the hill There
were more men than Parson Leggy the squire James Moore and the local
constables in the thick of it all striving frantically with voice and
gesture ay and stick too to stem the advance

It was useless on the dark wave rolled irresistible

On the far bank stood the little man motionless awaiting them with a
grin upon his face And a little farther in front was the Tailless Tyke
his back and neck like a newshorn wheatfield as he rumbled a vast
challenge

Come on gentlemen the little man cried Come on Ill bide for ye
never fear Yere a thousand to one and a dog Its the odds ye like
Englishmen a

And the mob with murder in its throat accepted the invitation and came
on

At the moment however from the slope above clear above the tramp of
the multitude a great voice bellowed Way Way Way for Mr Trotter
The advancing host checked and opened out and the secretary of the
meeting bundled through

He was a small fat man fussy at any time and perpetually perspiring
Now his face was crimson with rage and running he gesticulated wildly
vague words bubbled forth as his short legs twinkled down the slope

The crowd paused to admire Some one shouted a witticism and the crowd
laughed For the moment the situation was saved

The fat secretary hurried on down the slope unheeding of any insult but
the one He bounced over the plankbridge and as he came closer MAdam
saw that in each hand brandished a brick

Hoots man dinna throw he cried making a feint as though to turn in
sudden terror

Whats this Whats this gasped the secretary waving his arms

Bricks twad seem the other answered staying his flight

The secretary puffed up like a pudding in a hurry

Wheres the Cup Champion Challenge etc he jerked out Mind sir
youre responsible wholly responsible Dents damages delays Whats
it all mean sir Thesethese monstrous creations he brandished the
bricks and MAdam started backwrapped as I live in straw sir in
the Cup case sir the Cup case No Cup Infamous Disgraceful Insult
memeetingcommitteeevery one Whats it mean sir He paused to
pant his body filling and emptying like a bladder

MAdam approached him with one eye on the crowd which was heaving
forward again threatening still but sullen and silent

I pit em there he whispered and drew back to watch the effect of
his disclosure

The secretary gasped

Youyou not only do thisamazing thingthese monstrositieshe
hurled the bricks furiously on the unoffending groundbut you dare to
tell me so

The little man smiled

Do wrang and conceal it do right and confess it thats Englishmens
motto and mine as a rule but this time I had ma reasons

Reasons sir No reasons can justify such an extraordinary breach of
all thethe decencies Reasons the reasons of a maniac Not to say
more sir Fraudulent detentionfraudulent I say sir What were your
precious reasons

The mob with Tammas and Long Kirby at their head had now well nigh
reached the plankbridge They still looked dangerous and there were
isolated cries of

Duck him

Chuck him in

An the dog

Wi one o they bricks about their necks

There are my reasons said MAdam pointing to the forest of menacing
faces Ye see Im no beloved amang yonder gentlemen andin a stage
whisper in the others earI thocht maybe Id be tacked on the road

Tammas foremost of the crowd had now his foot upon the first plank

Ye robber ye thief Wait till we set hands on ye you and yer
gorilla he called

MAdam half turned

Wullie he said quietly keep the bridge

At the order the Tailless Tyke shot gladly forward and the leaders on
the bridge as hastily back The dog galloped on to the rattling plank
took his post fair and square in the centre of the narrow way and stood
facing the hostile crew like Cerberus guarding the gates of hell his
bullhead was thrust forward hackles up teeth glinting and a distant
rumbling in his throat as though daring them to come on

Yo first ole lad said Tammas hopping agilely behind Long Kirby

Nay the old uns lead cried the big smith his face graywhite He
wrenched round pinned the old man by the arms and held him forcibly
before him as a covering shield There ensued an unseemly struggle
betwixt the two valiants Tammas bellowing and kicking in the throes of
mortal fear

Jim Masonll show us he suggested at last

Nay said honest Jim Im feard He could say it with impunity for
the pluck of Postie Jim was a matter long past dispute

Then Jem Burtond go first

Nay Jem had a lovin wife and dear little kids at ome

Then Big Bell

Big Belld see isseif further first

A tall figure came forcing through the crowd his face a little paler
than its wont and a formidable knobkerry in his hand

Im goin said David

But yore not answered burly Saml gripping the boy from behind with
arms like the roots of an oak Your timell coom soon enough by the
look on yo wi niver no hurry

And the sense of the Dalesmen was with the big man for as old Rob
Saunderson said

I reckn hed liefer claw on to your throat lad nor ony o oors

As there was no one forthcoming to claim the honor of the lead Tammas
came forward with cunning counsel

Tell yo what lads wed best let em as dont know nowt at all aboot
him go first And onst theyre on mind we winna let em off but keep
ashovin and abovin on em forrad _Then_ usll foller

By this time there was a little naked space of green round the
bridgehead like a fairy circle into which the uninitiated might not
penetrate Round this the mob hedged the Dalesmen in front striving
knavishly back and bawling to those behind to leggo that shovin and
these latter urging valorously forward yelling jeers and contumely at
the front rank Come on Os afraid Lerrus through to em then
ye Royal Stanbacksfor well they knew the impossibility of their
demand

And as they wedged and jostled thus there stole out from their midst as
gallant a champion as ever trod the grass He trotted out into the
ring the observed of all and paused to gaze at the gaunt figure on the
bridge The sun lit the sprinkling of snow on the dome of his head one
forepaw was off the ground and he stood there royally alert scanning
his antagonist

Th Owd Un went up in a roar fit to split the air as the hero of the
day was recognized And the Dalesmen gave a pace forward spontaneously
as the gray knighterrant stole across the green

Oor Bobll fetch him they roared their blood leaping to fever heat
and gripped their sticks determined in stern reality to follow now

The gray champion trotted up on to the bridge and paused again the
long hair about his neck rising like a ruff and a strange glint in his
eyes and the holder of the bridge never moved Red and Gray stood thus
face to face the one gay yet resolute the other motionless his great
head slowly sinking between his forelegs seemingly petrified

There was no shouting now it was time for deeds not words Only above
the stillness came a sound from the bridge like the snore of a giant in
his sleep and blending with it a low deep purring thunder like some
monster cat well pleased

Wullie came a solitary voice from the far side keep the bridge

One ear went back one ear was still forward the great head was low and
lower between his forelegs and the glowing eyes rolled upward so that
the watchers could see the murderous white

Forward the gray dog stepped

Then for the second time that afternoon a voice stern and hard came
ringing down from the slope above over the heads of the many

Bob lad coom back

He he I thocht that was comin sneered the small voice over the
stream

The gray dog heard and checked

Bob lad coom in I say

At that he swung round and marched slowly back gallant as he had come
dignified still in his mortification

And Red Wull threw back his head and bellowed a paean of
victorychallenge triumph scorn all blended in that bulllike
bloodchilling blare

     

In the mean time MAdam and the secretary had concluded their business
It had been settled that the Cup was to be delivered over to James Moore
not later than the following Saturday

Saturday see at the latest the secretary cried as he turned and
trotted off

Mr Trotter MAdam called after him Im sorry but ye maun bide
this side the Lea till Ive reached the foot o the Pass Gin they
gentlemennodding toward the crowdshould set hands on me why
and he shrugged his shoulders significantly Forbye Wullies keepin
the bridge

With that the little man strolled off leisurely now dallying to pick a
flower now to wave a mocking hand at the furious mob and so slowly on
to the foot of the Muirk Muir Pass

There he turned and whistled that shrill peculiar note

Wullie Wullie to me he called

At that with one last threat thrown at the thousand souls he had held
at bay for thirty minutes the Tailless Tyke swung about and galloped
after his lord




Chapter XIII THE FACE IN THE FRAME


ALL Friday MAdam never left the kitchen He sat opposite the Cup in a
coma as it were and Red Wull lay motionless at his feet

Saturday came and still the two never budged Toward the evening
the little man rose all in a tremble and took the Cup down from the
mantelpiece then he sat down again with it in his arms

Eh Wullie Wullie is it a dream Ha they took her fra us Eh but
its you and I alane lad

He hugged it to him crying silently and rocking to and fro like a
mother with a dying child And Red Wull sat up on his haunches and
weaved from side to side in sympathy

As the dark was falling David looked in

At the sound of the opening door the little man swung round noiselessly
the Cup nursed in his arms and glared sullen and suspicious at the
boy yet seemed not to recognize him In the halflight David could see
the tears coursing down the little wizened face

Pon ma life hes gaein daft was his comment as he turned away to
Kenmuir And again the mourners were left alone

A few hours noo Wullie the little man wailed and shell be gane
We won her Wullie you and I won her fair shes lit the hoose for
us shes softened a for usand God kens we needed it she was the ae
thing we had to look to and love And noo theyre takin her awa and
twill be night agin Weve cherished her weve garnished her weve
loved her like oor ain and noo she maun gang to strangers who know her
not

He rose to his feet and the great dog rose with him His voice
heightened to a scream and he swayed with the Cup in his arms till it
seemed he must fall

Did they win her fair Wullie Na they plotted they conspired they
worked ilka ain o them agin us and they beat us Ay and noo theyre
robbin usrobbin us But they shallna ha her Oors or naebodys
Wullie Well finish her sooner nor that

He banged the Cup down on the table and rushed madly out of the room
Red Wull at his heels In a moment he came running back brandishing a
great axe about his head

Come on Wullie he cried Scots wha hae Noos the day and noos
the hour Come on

On the table before him serene and beautiful stood the target of his
madness The little man ran at it swinging his murderous weapon like a
flail

Oors or naebodys Wullie Come on Lay the proud usurpers low He
aimed a mighty buffet and the Shepherds Trophythe Shepherds Trophy
which had won through the hardships of a hundred yearswas almost gone
It seemed to quiver as the blow fell But the cruel steel missed and
the axehead sank into the wood clean and deep like a spade in snow

Red Wull had leapt on to the table and in his cavernous voice was
grumbling a chorus to his masters yells The little man danced up and
down tugging and straining at the axehandle

 You and I Wullie
 Tyrants fall in every foe
 Libertys in every blow

The axehead was as immoveable as the Muir Pike

 Let us do or die

The shaft snapped and the little man tottered back Red Wull jumped
down from the table and in doing so brushed against the Cup It
toppled over on to the floor and rolled tinkling away in the dust
And the little man fled madly out of the house still screaming his
warsong

 NBYou may see the dent in the Cups white sides to this
 day

     

When late that night MAdam returned home the Cup was gone Down on
his hands and knees he traced out its path plain to see where it had
rolled along the dusty floor Beyond that there was no sign

At first he was too much overcome to speak Then he raved round the room
like a derelict ship Red Wull following uneasily behind He cursed
he blasphemed he screamed and beat the walls with feverish hands A
stranger passing might well have thought this was a private Bedlam At
last exhausted he sat down and cried

Its David Wullie ye may depend David thats robbed his fathers
hoose Oh its a grand thing to ha a dutiful sonand he bowed his
gray head in his hands

David indeed it was He had come back to the Grange during his
fathers absence and taking the Cup from its grimy bed had marched it
away to its rightful home For that evening at Kenmuir James Moore had
said to him

David your fathers not sent the Cup I shall come and fetch it
tomorrow And David knew he meant it Therefore in order to save a
collision between his father and his frienda collision the issue of
which he dared hardly contemplate knowing as he did the unalterable
determination of the one and the lunatic passion of the otherthe boy
had resolved to fetch the Cup himself then and there in the teeth if
needs be of his father and the Tailless Tyke And he had done it

When he reached home that night he marched contrary to his wont
straight into the kitchen

There sat his father facing the door awaiting him his hands upon his
knees For once the little man was alone and David brave though he
was thanked heaven devoutly that Red Wull was elsewhere

For a while father and son kept silence watching one another like two
fencers

Twas you as took ma Cup asked the little man at last leaning
forward in his chair

Twas me as took Mr Moores Cup the boy replied I thowt yo mun
ha done wi itI found it all bashed upon the floor

You took itpit up to it nae doot by James Moore

David made a gesture of dissent

Ay by James Moore his father continued He dursena come hissel
for his illgotten spoils so he sent the son to rob the father The
cowardhis whole frame shook with passion Id ha thocht James
Moored ha bin man enough to come himself for what he wanted I see noo
I did him a wrangI misjudged him I kent him a heepocrite ain o yer
unco gudes a man as looks one thing says anither and does a third
and noo I ken hes a coward Hes feard o me sic as I am five foot
twa in ma stockins He rose from his chair and drew himself up to his
full height

Mr Moore had nowt to do wi it David persisted

Yere lyin James Moore pit ye to it

I tell yo he did not

Yed ha bin willin enough wioot him if yed thocht ot I grant ye
But yeve no the wits All there is o ye has gane to mak yer muckle
body Hooiver thats no matter Ill settle wi James Moore anither
time Ill settle wi you noo David MAdam

He paused and looked the boy over from bead to foot

So yere not only an idler a wastrel a liarhe spat the words
out YereGod help yea thief

Im no thief the boy returned hotly I did but give to a mon what ma
feythershame on himwrongfully kept from him

Wrangfully cried the little man advancing with burning face

Twas honorably done keepin what wasna yourn to keep Holdin back
his rights from a man Ay if ony ones the thief its not me its
you I say youand he looked his father in the face with flashing
eyes

Im the thief am I cried the other incoherent with passion Though
yere three times ma size Ill teach ma son to speak so to me

The old strap now long disused hung in the chimney corner As he spoke
the little man sprang back ripped it from the wall and almost before
David realized what he was at had brought it down with a savage slash
across his sons shoulders and as he smote he whistled a shrill
imperative note

Wullie Wullie to me

David felt the blow through his coat like a bar of hot iron laid across
his back His passion seethed within him every vein throbbed every
nerve quivered In a minute he would wipe out once and for all the
score of years for the moment however there was urgent business on
hand For outside he could hear the quick patter of feet hardgalloping
and the scurry of a huge creature racing madly to a call

With a bound he sprang at the open door and again the strap came
lashing down and a wild voice

Quick Wullie For Gods sake quick

David slammed the door to It shut with a rasping snap and at the same
moment a great body from without thundered against it with terrific
violence and a deep voice roared like the sea when thwarted of its
prey

Too late agin said David breathing hard and shot the bolt home
with a clang Then he turned on his father

Noo said he man to man

Ay cried the other father to son

The little man half turned and leapt at the old musketoon hanging on the
wall He missed it turned again and struck with the strap full at
the others face David caught the falling arm at the wrist hitting it
aside with such tremendous force that the bone all but snapped Then
he smote his father a terrible blow on the chest and the little man
staggered back gasping into the corner while the strap dropped from
his numbed fingers

Outside Red Wull whined and scratched but the two men paid no heed

David strode forward there was murder in his face The little man
saw it his time was come but his bitterest foe never impugned Adam
MAdams courage

He stood huddled in the corner all dishevelled nursing one arm with
the other entirely unafraid

Mind David he said quite calm murder twill be not
manslaughter

Murder twill be the boy answered in thick low voice and was
across the room

Outside Red Wull banged and clawed high up on the door with impotent
pats

The little man suddenly slipped his hand in his pocket pulled out
something and flung it The missile pattered on his sons face like a
raindrop on a charging bull and David smiled as he came on It dropped
softly on the table at his side he looked down andit was the face of
his mother which gazed up at him

Mither he sobbed stopping short Mither Ma God ye saved himand
me

He stood there utterly unhinged shaking and whimpering

It was some minutes before he pulled himself together then he walked to
the wall took down a pair of shears and seated himself at the table
still trembling Near him lay the miniature all torn and crumpled and
beside it the deepburied axehead

He picked up the strap and began cutting it into little pieces

There and there and there he said with each snip An ye hit me
agin there may be no mither to save ye

MAdam stood huddling in the corner He shook like an aspen leaf his
eyes blazed in his white face and he still nursed one arm with the
other

Honor yer father he quoted in small low voice




PART IV THE BLACK KILLER




Chapter XIV A MAD MAN


TAMMAS is on his feet in the taproom of the Arms brandishing a pewter
mug

Genlemen he cries his old face flushed I gie you a toast Stan
oop

The knot of Dalesmen round the fire rises like one The old man waves
his mug before him reckless of the good ale that drips on to the floor

The best sheepdog i th NorthOwd Bob o Kenmuir he cries In an
instant there is uproar the merry applause of clinking pewters the
stamping of feet the rattle of sticks Rob Saunderson and old Jonas
are cheering with the best Tupper and Ned Hoppin are bellowing in one
anothers ears Long Kirby and Jem Burton are thumping each other on
the back even Saml Todd and Sexton Ross are roused from their habitual
melancholy

Heres to Th Owd Un Heres to oor Bob yell stentorian voices while
Rob Saunderson has jumped on to a chair

Wi the best sheepdog i th North I gie yo the Shepherds
Trophywon outreet as will be he cries Instantly the clamor
redoubles

The Dale Cup and Th Owd Un The Trophy and oor Bob Ip ip for
the gray dogs Ip ip for the best sheepdog as ever was or will be
Ooray ooray

It is some minutes before the noise subsides and slowly the enthusiasts
resume their seats with hoarse throats and red faces

Gentlemen a

A little unconsidered man is standing up at the back of the room His
face is aflame and his hands twitch spasmodically and in front with
hackles up and eyes gleaming is a huge bulllike dog

Noo cries the little man I daur ye to repeat that lie

Lie screams Tammas lie Ill gie im lie Lemme at im I say

The old man in his fury is half over the surrounding ring of chairs
before Jim Mason on the one hand and Jonas Maddox on the other can pull
him back

Coom Mr Thornton soothes the octogenarian let un be Yo surely
baint angered by the likes o imand he jerks contemptuously toward
the solitary figure at his back

Tammas resumes his seat unwillingly

The little man in the far corner of the room remains silent waiting
for his challenge to be taken up It is in vain And as he looks at the
range of broad impassive backs turned on him he smiles bitterly

They dursent Wullie not a man of them a he cries
Theyre onetwothreefoureleven to one Wullie and yet
they dursent Eleven of them and every man a coward Long
KirbyThorntonTupperToddHoppinRossBurtonand the rest and
not one buts a bigger man nor me and yetWeel we might ha kent it
We should ha kent Englishmen by noo Theyre aye the same and aye have
bin They tell lies black lies

Tammas is again half out his chair and only forcibly restrained by the
men on either hand

and then they ha na the courage to stan by em Yere English
ivery man o ye to yer marrow

The little mans voice rises as he speaks He seizes the tankard from
the table at his side

Englishmen he cries waving it before him Heres a health The best
sheepdog as iver penned a flockAdam MAdams Red Wull

He pauses the pewter at his lips and looks at his audience with
flashing eyes There is no response from them

Wullie heres to you he cries Luck and life to ye ma trusty fier
Death and defeat to yer enemies

 The warlds warlds wrack we share ot
 The warstle and the care ot

He raises the tankard and drains it to its uttermost dreg

Then drawing himself up he addresses his audience once more

An noo Ill warn ye aince and for a and ye may tell James Moore I
said it He may plot agin us Wullie and me he may threaten us he may
win the Cup outright for his muckle favorite but there was niver a man
or dog yet as did Adam MAdam and his Red Wull a hurt but in the end he
wusht his mither hadna borne him

A little later and he walks out of the inn the Tailless Tyke at his
heels

After he is gone it is Rob Saunderson who says The little mons mad
hell stop at nothin and Tammas who answers

Nay not even murder

     

The little man had aged much of late His hair was quite white his eyes
unnaturally bright and his hands were never still as though he were in
everlasting pain He looked the picture of disease

After Owd Bobs second victory he had become morose and untalkative At
home he often sat silent for hours together drinking and glaring at the
place where the Cup had been Sometimes he talked in low eerie voice to
Red Wull and on two occasions David turning suddenly had caught his
father glowering stealthily at him with such an expression on his face
as chilled the boys blood The two never spoke now and David held this
silent deadly enmity far worse than the oldtime perpetual warfare

It was the same at the Sylvester Arms The little man sat alone with Red
Wull exchanging words with no man drinking steadily brooding over his
wrongs only now and again galvanized into sudden action

Other people than Tammas Thornton came to the conclusion that MAdam
would stop at nothing in the undoing of James Moore or the gray dog
They said drink and disappointment had turned his head that he was mad
and dangerous And on New Years day matters seemed coming to a crisis
for it was reported that in the gloom of a snowy evening he had drawn
a knife on the Master in the High Street but slipped before he could
accomplish his fell purpose

Most of them all David was haunted with an everpresent anxiety as to
the little mans intentions The boy even went so far as to warn his
friend against his father But the Master only smiled grimly

Thank ye lad he said But I reckn we can fend for oorsels Bob
and I Eh Owd Un

Anxious as David might be he was not so anxious as to be above taking
a mean advantage of this state of strained apprehension to work on
Maggies fears

One evening he was escorting her home from church when just before
they reached the larch copse Goo sakes Whats that he ejaculated
in horrorladen accents starting back

What Davie cried the girl shrinking up to him all in a tremble

Couldna say for sure It mought be owt or agin it mought be nowt But
yo grip my arm Ill grip yo waist

Maggie demurred

Canst see onythin she asked still in a flutter

Beind the edge

Wheer

Theer pointing vaguely

I canna see nowt

Why theer lass Can yo not see Then yo pit your head along o
minesoclosercloser Then in aggrieved tones Whativer is the
matter wi yo wench I might be a leprosy

But the girl was walking away with her head high as the snowcapped
Pike

So long as I live David MAdam she cried Ill niver go to church
wi you agin

Iss but you will thoughonst he answered low

Maggie whisked round in a flash superbly indignant

What dyo mean sirrr

Yo know what I mean lass he replied sheepish and shuffling before
her queenly anger

She looked him up and down and down and up again

Ill niver speak to you agin Mr MAdam she cried not if it was
ever soNay Ill walk home by myself thank you Ill ha nowt to do
wi you

So the two must return to Kenmuir one behind the other like a lady and
her footman

Davids audacity had more than once already all but caused a rupture
between the pair And the occurrence behind the hedge set the cap on his
impertinences That was past enduring and Maggie by her bearing let him
know it

David tolerated the girls new attitude for exactly twelve minutes by
the kitchen clock Then Sulk wi me indeed Ill teach her and he
marched out of the door Niver to cross it agin ma word

Afterward however he relented so far as to continue his visits as
before but he made it clear that he only came to see the Master and
hear of Owd Bobs doings On these occasions he loved best to sit on the
windowsill outside the kitchen and talk and chaff with Tammas and the
men in the yard feigning an uneasy bashfulness when reference made to
Bessie Bolstock And after sitting thus for some time he would half
turn look over his shoulder and remark in indifferent tones to the
girl within Oh goodevenin I forgot yo and then resume his
conversation While the girl within her face a little pinker her
lips a little tighter and her chin a little higher would go about her
business pretending neither to hear nor care

The suspicions that MAdam nourished dark designs against James Moore
were somewhat confirmed in that on several occasions in the bitter
dusks of January afternoons a little insidious figure was reported to
have been seen lurking among the farmbuildings of Kenmuir

Once Saml Todd caught the little man fairly skulking away in the
woodshed Saml took him up bodily and carried him down the slope to the
Wastrel shaking him gently as he went

Across the stream he put him on his feet

If I catches yo cadgerin aroun the farm agin little mon he
admonished holding up a warning finger Ill tak yo and drap yo
in t Sheepwash I warn yo fair Id ha done it noo an yod bin a
bigger and a younger mon But theer yom sic a scrappety bit Noo rin
whoam And the little man slunk silently away

For a time he appeared there no more Then one evening when it was
almost dark James Moore going the round of the outbuildings felt Owd
Bob stiffen against his side

Whats oop lad he whispered halting and dropping his hand on the
old dogs neck felt a ruff of rising hair beneath it

Steady lad steady he whispered what is t He peered forward
into the gloom and at length discerned a little familiar figure huddled
away in the crevice between two stacks

Its yo is it MAdam he said and bending seized a wisp of Owd
Bobs coat in a grip like a vice

Then in a great voice moved to rare anger

Oot o this afore I do ye a hurt ye meeserable spyin creetur he
roared Yo mun wait till dark cooms to hide yo yo coward afore yo
daur coom crawlin aboot ma hoose frightenin the womenfolk and up to
yer devilments If yove owt to say to me coom like a mon in the open
day Noo git aff wi yo afore I lay hands to yo

He stood there in the dusk tall and mighty a terrible figure one hand
pointing to the gate the other still grasping the gray dog

The little man scuttled away in the halflight and out of the yard

On the plankbridge he turned and shook his fist at the darkening house

Curse ye James Moore he sobbed Ill be even wi ye yet




Chapter XV DEATH ON THE MARCHES


ON the top of this there followed an attempt to poison Th Owd Un At
least there was no other accounting for the affair

In the dead of a longremembered night James Moore was waked by a low
moaning beneath his room He leapt out of bed and ran to the window to
see his favorite dragging about the moonlit yard the dark head
down the proud tail for once lowered the lithe limbs wooden heavy
unnaturalaltogether pitiful

In a moment he was downstairs and out to his friends assistance
Whativer ist Owd Un he cried in anguish

At the sound of that dear voice the old dog tried to struggle to him
could not and fell whimpering

In a second the Master was with him examining him tenderly and crying
for Saml who slept above the stables

There was every symptom of foul play the tongue was swollen and almost
black the breathing labored the body twitched horribly and the soft
gray eyes all bloodshot and straining in agony

With the aid of Saml and Maggie drenching first and stimulants after
the Master pulled him around for the moment And soon Jim Mason and
Parson Leggy hurriedly summoned came running hotfoot to the rescue

Prompt and stringent measures saved the victimbut only just For a
time the best sheepdog in the North was pawing at the Gate of Death In
the end as the gray dawn broke the danger passed

The attempt to get at him if attempt it was aroused passionate
indignation in the countryside It seemed the culminatingpoint of the
excitement long bubbling

There were no traces of the culprit not a vestige to lead to
incrimination so cunningly had the criminal accomplished his foul task
But as to the perpetrator if there where no proofs there were yet fewer
doubts

At the Sylvester Arms Long Kirby asked MAdam pointblank for his
explanation of the matter

Hoo do I count for it the little man cried I dinna count for it
ava

Then hoo did it happen asked Tammas with asperity

I dinna believe it did happen the little man replied Its a lee
o James Mooresa characteristic lee Whereon they chucked him out
incontinently for the Terror for once was elsewhere

Now that afternoon is to be remembered for threefold causes Firstly
because as has been said MAdam was alone Secondly because a few
minutes after his ejectment the window of the taproom was thrown open
from without and the little man looked in He spoke no word but those
dim smouldering eyes of his wandered from face to face resting for
a second on each as if to burn them on his memory Ill remember ye
gentlemen he said at length quietly shut the window and was gone

Thirdly for a reason now to be told

Though ten days had elapsed since the attempt on him the gray dog had
never been his old self since He had attacks of shivering his vitality
seemed sapped he tired easily and great heart would never own it
At length on this day James Moore leaving the old dog behind him had
gone over to Grammochtown to consult Dingley the vet On his way home
he met Jim Mason with Gyp the faithful Betsys unworthy successor at
the Dalesmans Daughter Together they started for the long tramp home
over the Marches And that journey is marked with a red stone in this
story

All day long the hills had been bathed in impenetrable fog Throughout
there had been an accompanying drizzle and in the distance the wind
had moaned a stormmenace To the darkness of the day was added the
sombreness of falling night as the three began the ascent of the
Murk Muir Pass By the time they emerged into the Devils Bowl it was
altogether black and blind But the threat of wind had passed leaving
utter stillness and they could hear the splash of an otter on the far
side of the Lone Tarn as they skirted that gloomy waters edge When at
length the last steep rise on to the Marches had been topped a breath
of soft air smote them lightly and the curtain of fog began drifting
away

The two men swung steadily through the heather with that reaching stride
the birthright of moormen and highlanders They talked but little
for such was their nature a word or two on sheep and the approaching
lambingtime thence on to the coming Trials the Shepherds Trophy
Owd Bob and the attempt on him and from that to MAdam and the Tailless
Tyke

Dyo reckn MAdam had a hand int the postman was asking

Nay theres no proof

Ceptin hes mad to get shut o Th Owd Un afore Cup Day

Im or meit maks no differ For a dog is disqualified from competing
for the Trophy who has changed hands during the six months prior to the
meeting And this holds good though the change be only from father to
son on the decease of the former

Jim looked up inquiringly at his companion

Dyo think itll coom to that he asked

What

Whymurder

Not if I can help it the other answered grimly

The fog had cleared away by now and the moon was up To their right
on the crest of a rise some two hundred yards away a low wood stood out
black against the sky As they passed it a blackbird rose up screaming
and a brace of woodpigeons winged noisily away

Hullo hark to the yammerin muttered Jim stopping and at this
time o night too

Some rabbits playing in the moonlight on the outskirts of the wood sat
up listened and hopped back into security At the same moment a big
hillfox slunk out of the covert He stole a pace forward and halted
listening with one ear back and one pad raised then cantered silently
away in the gloom passing close to the two men and yet not observing
them

Whats up I wonder mused the postman

The fox set em clackerin I reckn said the Master

Not he he was scared maist oot o his skin the other answered Then
in tones of suppressed excitement with his hands on James Moores arm
And lookee theers ma Gyp abeckonin on us

There indeed on the crest of the rise beside the wood was the
little lurcher now looking back at his master now creeping stealthily
forward

Ma word theers summat wrong yonder cried Jim and jerked the
postbags off his shoulder Coom on Master and he set off running
toward the dog while James Moore himself excited now followed with an
agility that belied his years

Some score yards from the lower edge of the spinney upon the farther
side of the ridge a tiny beck babbled through its bed of peat The
two men as they topped the rise noticed a flock of blackfaced
mountainsheep clustered in the dip twixt wood and stream They stood
martialled in close array facing half toward the wood half toward
the newcomers heads up eyes glaring handsome as sheep only look when
scared

On the crest of the ridge the two men halted beside Gyp The postman
stood with his head a little forward listening intently Then he
dropped in the heather like a dead man pulling the other with him

Doon mon he whispered clutching at Gyp with his spare hand

What ist Jim asked the Master now thoroughly roused

Summat movin i th wood the other whispered listening
weaseleared

So they lay motionless for a while but there came no sound from the
copse

Appen twas nowt the postman at length allowed peering cautiously
about And yet I thowtI dunno reetly what I thowt

Then starting to his knees with a hoarse cry of terror Save us
whats yon theer

Then for the first time the Master raised his head and noticed lying in
the gloom between them and the array of sheep a still white heap

James Moore was a man of deeds not words

Its past waitin he said and sprang forward his heart in his
mouth

The sheep stamped and shuffled as he came and yet did not break

Ah thanks be he cried dropping beside the motionless body its
nobbut a sheep As he spoke his hands wandered deftly over the
carcase But whats this he called Stout she was as me Look at
her fleececrisp close strong feel the fleshfirm as a rock And
neer a bone broke nere a scrat on her body a pin could mak As
healthy as a monand yet dead as mutton

 NB StoutHearty

Jim still trembling from the horror of his fear came up and knelt
beside his friend Ah but theres bin devilry in this he said I
reckned they sheep had bin badly skeared and not so long agone

Sheepmurder sure enough the other answered No foxs doina
girtgrown twoshear as could maist knock a hox

Jims hands travelled from the body to the dead creatures throat He
screamed

By gob Master look ee theer He held his hand up in the moonlight
and it dripped red And warm yet warm

Tear some bracken Jim ordered the other and set alight We mun see
to this

The postman did as bid For a moment the fern smouldered and smoked
then the flame ran crackling along and shot up in the darkness
weirdly lighting the scene to the right the low wood a block of solid
blackness against the sky in front the wall of sheep staring out of
the gloom with bright eyes and as centrepiece that still white body
with the kneeling men and lurcher sniffing tentatively round

The victim was subjected to a critical examination The throat and that
only had been hideously mauled from the raw wounds the flesh hung in
horrid shreds on the ground all about were little pitiful dabs of
wool wrenched off apparently in a struggle and crawling among the
fernroots a snakelike track of red led down to the stream

A dogs doin and no mistakin thot said Jim at length after a
minute inspection

Ay declared the Master with slow emphasis and a sheepdogs too
and an old uns or Im no shepherd

The postman looked up

Why thot he asked puzzled

Becos the Master answered im as did this killed for bloodand for
blood only If had bin ony other doggreyhound bull tarrier or even
a young sheepdogdyo think hed ha stopped wi the one Not he
hed ha gone through em and be runnin em as like as not yet
nippin em pullin em down till hed maybe killed the half But im
as did this killed for blood I say He got itkilled just the one and
nary touched the others dyo see Jim

The postman whistled long and low

Its just what owd Wrottesleyd tell on he said I never nobbut
half believed him thenI do now though Dyo mind what th owd ladd
tell Master

James Moore nodded

Thots it Ive never seen the like afore myself but Ive heard ma
grandad speak ot monys the time An owd dogll git the cravin for
sheeps blood on him just the same as a mon does for the drink he
creeps oot o nights gallops afar hunts his sheep downs er and
satisfies the cravin And he nary kills but the one they say for he
knows the value o sheep same as you and me He has his gallop quenches
the thirst and then hes for home maybe a score mile away and no one
the wiser i th mornin And so on till he cooms to a bloody death
the murderin traitor

If he does said Jim

And he does they say nigh always For he gets bolder and bolder wi
not bein caught until one fine night a bullet lets light into him And
some mon gets knocked nigh endways when they bring his best tyke home i
th mornin dead wi the sheeps wool yet stickin in his mouth

The postman whistled again

Its what owd Wrottesleyd tell on to a tick And hed say if ye
mind Master as hoo the dogd niver kill his masters sheepkind o
consciencelike

Ay Ive heard that said the Master Queer too and im bein such a
bad un

Jim Mason rose slowly from his knees

Ma word he said I wish Th Owd Un was here Hed appen show us
summat

I nobbut wish he was pore owd lad said the Master

As he spoke there was a crash in the wood above them a sound as of some
big body bursting furiously through brushwood

The two men rushed to the top of the rise In the darkness they could
see nothing only standing still and holding their breaths they could
hear the faint sound ever growing fainter of some creature splashing
in a hasty gallop over the wet moors

Yons him Yons no fox Ill tak oath And a main big un too hark
to him cried Jim Then to Gyp who had rushed off in hot pursuit
Coom back chunkead Whats use o you agin a gallopin potamus

Gradually the sounds died away and away and were no more

Thots im the devil said the Master at length

Nay the devil has a tail they do say replied Jim thoughtfully For
already the light of suspicion was focusing its red glare

Noo I reckn were in for bloody times amang the sheep for a while
said the Master as Jim picked up his bags

Better a sheep nor a mon answered the postman still harping on the
old theme




Chapter XVI THE BLACK KILLER


THAT as James Moore had predicted was the first only of a long
succession of such solitary crimes

Those who have not lived in a desolate country like that about the
Muir Pike where sheep are paramount and every other man engaged in the
profession pastoral can barely imagine the sensation aroused In market
place tavern or cottage the subject of conversation was always the
latest sheepmurder and the yetundetected criminal

Sometimes there would be a lull and the shepherds would begin to
breathe more freely Then there would come a stormy night when the
heavens were veiled in the cloak of crime and the wind moaned fitfully
over meres and marches and another victim would be added to the
lengthening list

It was always such black nights nights of wind and weather when no man
would be abroad that the murderer chose for his bloody work and that
was how he became known from the Red Screes to the Muir Pike as the
Black Killer In the Daleland they still call a wild wet night A Black
Killers night for they say His ghaistll be oot the night

There was hardly a farm in the countryside but was marked with the seal
of blood Kenmuir escaped and the Grange Rob Saunderson at the Holt
and Tupper at Swinsthwaite and they were about the only lucky ones

As for Kenmuir Tammas declared with a certain grim pride He knows
bettern to coom wheer Th Owd Un be Whereat MAdam was taken with a
fit of internal spasms rubbing his knees and cackling insanely for a
halfhour afterward And as for the luck of the Grangewell there was
a reason for that too so the Dalesmen said

Though the area of crime stretched from the Black Water to
Grammochtown twentyodd miles there was never a sign of the
perpetrator The Killer did his bloody work with a thoroughness and a
devilish cunning that defied detection

It was plain that each murder might be set down to the same agency Each
was stamped with the same unmistakable signmanual one sheep killed
its throat torn into red ribands and the others untouched

It was at the instigation of Parson Leggy that the squire imported a
bloodhound to track the Killer to his doom Set on at a fresh killed
carcase at the One Tree Knowe he carried the line a distance in the
direction of the Muir Pike then was thrown out by a little bustling
beck and never acknowledged the scent again Afterward he became
unmanageable and could be no further utilized Then there was talk of
inducing Tommy Dobson and his pack to come over from Eskdale but
that came to nothing The Master of the Border Hunt lent a couple of
foxhounds who effected nothing and there were a hundred other attempts
and as many failures Jim Mason set a cunning trap or two and caught his
own bobtailed tortoiseshell and a terrible wigging from his missus
Ned Hoppin sat up with a gun two nights over a new slain victim and
Londesley of the Home Farm poisoned a carcase But the Killer never
returned to the kill and went about in the midst of the all carrying
on his infamous traffic and laughing up his sleeve

In the meanwhile the Dalesmen raged and swore vengeance their
impotence their unsuccess and their losses heating their wrath to
madness And the bitterest sting of it all lay in this that though they
could not detect him they were nigh to positive as to the culprit

Many a time was the Black Killer named in lowvoiced conclave many a
time did Long Kirby as he stood in the Border Ram and watched MAdam
and the Terror walking down the High nudge Jim Mason and whisper

Theers the Killeroneasy be his grave To which practical Jim always
made the same retort

Ay theers the Killer but wheers the proof

And therein lay the crux There was scarcely a man in the countryside
who doubted the guilt of the Tailless Tyke but as Jim said where
was the proof They could but point to his wellwon nickname his evil
notoriety say that magnificent sheepdog as he was he was known even
in his work as a rough handler of stock and lastly remark significantly
that the grange was one of the few farms that had so far escaped
unscathed For with the belief that the Black Killer was a sheepdog
they held it as an article of faith that he would in honour spare his
masters flock

There may indeed have been prejudice in their judgement For each has
his private grudge against the Terror and nigh every man bore on his
own person or his clothes or on the body of his dog the mark of that
huge savage

Proof

Why he near killed ma Lassie cries Londesley

And he did kill the Wexer

And Wan Tromp

And see pore old Wenus says John Swan and pulls out that fair
Amazon battered almost past recognition but a warrioress still

Thats Red Wullbloody be his end

And he laid ma Rasper by for nigh three weeks continues Tupper
pointing to the yetunhealed scars on the neck of the big bobtail See
thiseyhis work

And look here cries Saunderson exposing a ragged wound in Sheps
throat thots the Terrorblack be his fa

Ay says Long Kirby with an oath the tykes love him nigh as much as
we do

Yes says Tammas Yo jest watch

The old man slips out of the taproom and in another moment from the
road without comes a heavy regular patpatpat as of some big creature
approaching and blending with the sound little shuffling footsteps

In an instant every dog in the room has risen to his feet and stands
staring at the door with sullen glowing eyes lips wrinkling bristles
rising throats rumbling

An unsteady hand fumbles at the door a reedy voice calls Wullie come
here and the dogs move away surly to either side of the fireplace
tails down ears back grumbling still the picture of cowed passion
Then the door opens Tammas enters grinning and each after a moments
scrutiny resumes his former position before the fire

     

Meanwhile over MAdam seemingly all unsuspicious of these suspicions
a change had come Whether it was that for the time he heard less of the
best sheepdog in the North or for some more occult reason certain it
is that he became his old self His tongue wagged as gayly and bitterly
as ever and hardly a night passed but he infuriated Tammas almost to
blows with his innuendoes and insidious sarcasms

Old Jonas Maddox one evening at the Sylvester Arms inquired of him
what his notion was as to the identity of the Killer

I hae ma suspicions Mr Maddox I hae ma suspicions the little man
replied cunningly wagging his head and giggling But more than that
they could not elicit from him A week later however to the question

And what are yo thinkin o this black Killer Mr Madam

Why _black_ the little man asked earnestly why _black_ mair than
whiteor _gray_ well say Luckily for him however the Dalesmen are
slow of wit as of speech

David too marked the difference in his father who nagged at him now
and then with all the old spirit At first he rejoiced in then change
preferring his outward and open warfare to that aforetime stealthy
enmity But soon he almost wished the other back for the older he grew
the more difficult did he find it to endure calmly these everlasting
bickerings

For one reason he was truly glad of the altered condition of affairs he
believed that for the nonce at least his father had abandoned any
ill designs he might have cherished against James Moore those sneaking
visits to Kenmuir were he hoped discontinued

Yet Maggie Moore had she been on speaking terms with him could have
undeceived him For one night when alone in the kitchen on suddenly
looking up she had seen to her horror a dim moonlike face glued
against the windowpane In the first mad panic of the moment she almost
screamed and dropped her work thena true Moorecontrolled herself
and sat feigning to work yet watching all the while

It was MAdam she recognized that the face pale in its framework
of black the hair lying dank and dark on his forehead and the white
eyelids blinking slow regular horrible She thought of the stories
she had heard of his sworn vengeance on her father and her heart stood
still though she never moved At length with a gasp of relief she
discerned that the eyes were not directed on her Stealthily following
their gaze she saw they rested on the Shepherds Trophy and on the Cup
they remained fixed immovable while she sat motionless and watched

An hour it seemed to her elapsed before they shifted their direction
and wandered round the room For a second they dwelt upon her then the
face withdrew into the night

Maggie told no one what she had seen Knowing well how terrible her
father was in his anger she deemed it wiser to keep silence While as
for David MAdam she would never speak to him again

And not for a moment did that young man surmise whence his father came
when on the night in question MAdam returned to the Grange chuckling
to himself David was growing of late accustomed to these fits of
silent unprovoked merriment and when his father began giggling and
muttering to Red Wull at first he paid no heed

He he Wullie Aiblins well beat him yet Theres many a slip
twixt Cup and lipeh Wullie he he And he made allusion to the
flourishing of the wicked and their fall ending always with the same
refrain He he Wullie Aiblins well beat him yet

In this strain he continued until David his patience exhausted asked
roughly

What ist yo mumblin aboot Wha is it yoll beat you and yer
Wullie

The lads tone was as contemptuous as his words Long ago he had cast
aside any semblance of respect for his father

MAdam only rubbed his knees and giggled

Hark to the dear lad Wullie Listen hoo pleasantly he addresses his
auld dad Then turning on his son and leering at him What is it
ye ask Wha should it be but the Black Killer Wha else is there Id be
wushin to hurt

The Black Killer echoed the boy and looked at his father in
amazement

Now David was almost the only man in Wastreldale who denied Red Wulls
identity with the Killer Nay he said once hed kill me given half
a chance but a sheepno Yet though himself of this opinion he knew
well what the talk was and was astonished accordingly at his fathers
remark

The Black Killer is it What dyou know o the Killer he inquired

Why _black_ I wad ken Why _black_ the little man asked leaning
forward in his chair

Now David though repudiating in the village Red Wulls complicity
with the crimes at home was never so happy as when casting cunning
innuendoes to that effect

What would you have him then he asked Red yaller muckdirt
colourand he stared significantly at the Tailless Tyke who was
lying at his masters feet The little man ceased rubbing his knees and
eyed the boy David shifted uneasily beneath that dim persistent stare

Well he said at length gruffly

The little man giggled and his two thin hands took up their task again

Aiblins his puir auld doited fool of a dad kens mair than the dear lad
thinks for ay or wusheseh Wullie he he

Then what is it you do know or think yo know David asked irritably

The little man nodded and chuckled

Naethin ava laddie naethin worth the mention Only aiblins the
Killerll be caught afore sae lang

David smiled incredulously wagging his head in offensive scepticism

Yoll catch him yoself I spose you and yer Wullie Tak a chair on
to the Marches whistle a while and when the Killer comes why pit a
pinch o salt upon his tailif he had one

At the last words heavily punctuated by the speaker the little man
stopped his rubbing as though shot

What wad ye mean by that he asked softly

What wad I the boy replied

I dinna ken for sure the little man answered and its aiblins just
as well for you dear ladin fawning accentsthat I dinna He
began rubbing and giggling afresh Its a gran thing Wullie to ha
a dutiful son a shairp lad wha has no silly sens o shame aboot
sharpenin his wits at his auld dads expense And yet despite
oor facetious lad there aiblins we will ha a hand in the Killers

wagged his stump tail in reply

David rose from his chair and walked across the room to where his father
sat

If yo know sic a mighty heap he shouted happen youll just tell me
what yo do know

MAdam stopped stroking Red Wulls massive head and looked up

Tell ye Ay wha should I tell if not ma dear David Tell Ay Ill
tell ye thiswith a sudden snarl of bitternessThat youd be the
vairy last person I wad tell




Chapter XVII A MAD DOG


DAVID and Maggie meanwhile were drifting further and further apart He
now thought the girl took too much upon herself that this assumption of
the woman and the mother was overdone Once on a Sunday he caught her
hearing Andrew his catechism He watched the performance through a crack
in the door and listened giggling to her simple teaching At length
his merriment grew so boisterous that she looked up saw him and
straightway rising to her feet crossed the room and shut the door
tendering her unspoken rebuke with such a sweet dignity that he slunk
away for once decently ashamed And the incident served to add point to
his hostility

Consequently he was seldom at Kenmuir and more often at home
quarrelling with his father

Since that day two years before when the boy had been an instrument in
the taking of the Cup from him father and son had been like two vessels
charged with electricity contact between which might result at any
moment in a shock and a flash This was the outcome not of a moment but
of years

Of late the contest had raged markedly fierce for MAdam noticed his
sons more frequent presence at home and commented on the fact in his
usual spirit of playful raillery

Whats come to ye David he asked one day Yer auld dads head is
nigh turned wi yer condescension Is James Moore feared yell steal the
Cup fra him as ye stole it from me that hell not ha ye at Kenmuir
or what is it

I thought I could maybe keep an eye on the Killer gin I stayed here
David answered leering at Red Wull

Yed do better at Kenmuireh Wullie the little man replied

Nay the other answered hell not go to Kenmuir Theres Th Owd Un
to see to him there o nights

The little man whipped round

Are ye so sure he is there o nights ma lad he asked with slow
significance

He was there when some oneI dinna say who though I have ma
thoughtstried to poison him sneered the boy mimicking his fathers
manner

MAdam shook his head

If he was poisoned and noo I think aiblins he was he didna pick it up
at Kenmuir I tell ye that he said and marched out of the room

In the mean time the Black Killer pursued his bloody trade unchecked
The public always greedy of a new sensation took up the matter
In several of the great dailies articles on the Agrarian Outrages
appeared followed by lengthy correspondence Controversy raged high
each correspondent had his own theory and his own solution of the
problem and each waxed indignant as his were discarded for anothers

The Terror had reigned already two months when with the advent of the
lambingtime matters took a yet more serious aspect

It was bad enough to lose one sheep often the finest in the pack but
the hunting of a flock at a critical moment which was incidental to the
slaughter of the one the scaring of these woolly mothersabouttobe
almost out of their fleeces spelt for the small farmers something akin
to ruin for the bigger ones a loss hardly bearable

Such a woful season had never been known loud were the curses deep
the vows of revenge Many a shepherd at that time patrolled all night
through with his dogs only to find in the morning that the Killer had
slipped him and havocked in some secluded portion of his beat

It was heartrending work and all the more so in that though his
incrimination seemed as far off as ever there was still the same
positiveness as to the culprits identity

Long Kirby indeed greatly daring went so far on one occasion as to
say to the little man And dyo reckn the Killer is a sheepdog
MAdam

I do the little man replied with conviction

And that hell spare his own sheep

Niver a doubt of it

Then said the smith with a nervous cackle it must lie between you
and Tupper and Saunderson

The little man leant forward and tapped the other on the arm

Or Kenmuir ma friend he said Yeve forgot Kenmuir

So I have laughed the smith so I have

Then Id not anither time the other continued still tapping Id
mind Kenmuir dye see Kirby

     

It was about the middle of the lambingtime when the Killer was working
his worst that the Dalesmen had a lurid glimpse of Adam MAdam as he
might be were he wounded through his Wullie

Thus it came about It was marketday in Grammochtown and in the
Border Ram old Rob Saunderson was the centre of interest For on the
previous night Rob who till then had escaped unscathed had lost a
sheep to the Killer andfar worsehis flock of Herdwicks heavy in
lamb had been galloped with disastrous consequences

The old man with tears in his eyes was telling how on four nights that
week he had been up with Shep to guard against mishap and on the fifth
worn out with his double labor had fallen asleep at his post But
a very little while he slumbered yet when in the dawn he woke and
hurried on his rounds he quickly came upon a mangled sheep and the
pitiful relic of his flock A relic indeed For all about were cold
wee lambkins and their mothers dead and dying of exhaustion and their
unripe travaila slaughter of the innocents

The Dalesmen were clustered round the old shepherd listening with
lowering countenances when a dark gray head peered in at the door and
two wistful eyes dwelt for a moment on the speaker

Talk o the devil muttered MAdam but no man heard him For Red
Wull too had seen that sad face and rising from his masters feet
had leapt with a roar at his enemy toppling Jim Mason like a ninepin in
the fury of his charge

In a second every dog in the room from the battered Venus to Tuppers
big Rasper was on his feet bristling to have at the tyrant and wipe
out past injuries if the gray dog would but lead the dance

It was not to be however For Long Kirby was standing at the door with
a cup of hot coffee in his hand Barely had he greeted the gray dog
with

Ullo Owd Un when hoarse yells of Ware lad The Terror mingled
with Red Wulls roar

Half turning he saw the great dog bounding to the attack Straightway
he flung the boiling contents of his cup full in that ragewracked
countenance The burning liquid swished against the huge bullhead
Blinding bubbling scalding it did its fell work well nothing escaped
that merciless torrent With a cry of agony half bellow half howl
Red Wull checked in his charge From without the door was banged to and
again the duel was postponed While within the taproom a huddle of men
and dogs were left alone with a mad man and a madder brute

Blind demented agonized the Tailless Tyke thundered about the little
room gnashing snapping oversetting men tables chairs swirled off
their legs as though they had been dolls He spun round like a monstrous
teetotum he banged his tortured head against the wall he burrowed
into the unyielding floor And all the while MAdam pattered after him
laying hands upon him only to be flung aside as a terrier flings a rat
Now up now down again now tossed into a corner now dragged upon
the floor yet always following on and crying in supplicating tones
Wullie Wullie let me to ye let yer man ease ye and then with
a scream and a murderous glance By  Kirby Ill deal wi you
later

The uproar was like hell let loose You could hear the noise of oaths
and blows as the men fought for the door a halfmile away And above
it the horrid bellowing and the screaming of that shrill voice

Long Kirby was the first man out of that murderhole and after him
the others toppled one by onemen and dogs jostling one another in
the frenzy of their fear Big Bell Londesley Tupper Hoppin Teddy
Bolstock whitefaced and trembling and old Saunderson they pulled out
by his heels Then the door was shut with a clang and the little man
and mad dog were left alone

In the street was already a bigeyed crowd attracted by the uproar
while at the door was James Moore seeking entrance Happen I could
lend the little mon a hand said he but they withheld him forcibly

Inside was pandemonium bangings like the doors of hell the bellowing
of that great voice the patter of little feet the slithering of a
body on the floor and always that shrill beseeching prayer Wullie
Wullie let me to ye and in a scream By  Kirby Ill be wi ye
soon

Jim Mason it was who turned at length to the smith and whispered
Kirby lad yod best skip it

The big man obeyed and ran The stampstamp of his feet on the hard road
rang above the turmoil As the long legs vanished round the corner and
the sound of the fugitive died away a panic seized the listening crowd

A woman shrieked a girl fainted and in two minutes the street was as
naked of men as the steppes of Russia in winter here a white face at a
window there a door ajar and peering round a far corner a frightened
boy One man only scorned to run Alone James Moore stalked down the
centre of the road slow and calm Owd Bob trotting at his heels

It was a long halfhour before the door of the inn burst open and
MAdam came out with a run flinging the door behind him

He rushed into the middle of the road his sleeves were rolled at
the wrist like a surgeons and in his right hand was a blackhandled
jackknife

Noo by  he cried in a terrible voice where is he

He looked up and down the road darting his fiery glances everywhere
and his face was whiter than his hair

Then he turned and hunted madly down the whole length of the High
nosing like a weasel in every cranny stabbing at the air as he went
and screaming By  Kirby wait till I get ye




Chapter XVIII HOW THE KILLER WAS SINGED


No further harm came of the incident but it served as a healthy
objectlesson for the Dalesmen

A coincidence it may have been but as a fact for the fortnight
succeeding Kirbys exploit there was a lull in the crimes There
followed as though to make amends the seven days still remembered in
the Daleland as the Bloody Week

On the Sunday the Squire lost a Cheviot ewe killed not a hundred yards
from the Manor wall On the Monday a farm on the Black Water was marked
with the red cross On Tuesdaya black nightTupper at Swinsthwaite
came upon the murderer at his work he fired into the darkness without
effect and the Killer escaped with a scaring On the following night
Viscount Birdsaye lost a shearling ram for which he was reported to
have paid a fabulous sum Thursday was the one blank night of the week
On Friday Tupper was again visited and punished heavily as though in
revenge for that shot

On the Saturday afternoon a big meeting was held at the Manor to discuss
measures The Squire presided gentlemen and magistrates were there in
numbers and every farmer in the countryside

To start the proceedings the Special Commissioner read a futile letter
from the Board of Agriculture After him Viscount Birdsaye rose and
proposed that a reward more suitable to the seriousness of the case
than the paltry 5 pounds of the Police should be offered and backed his
proposal with a 25 pound cheque Several others spoke and last of all
Parson Leggy rose

He briefly summarized the history of the crimes reiterated his belief
that a sheepdog was the criminal declared that nothing had occurred
to shake his conviction and concluded by offering a remedy for their
consideration Simple it was so he said to laughableness yet if
their surmise was correct it would serve as an effectual preventive if
not cure and would at least give them time to turn round He paused

My suggestion is That every manjack of you who owns a sheepdog ties
him up at night

The farmers were given half an hour to consider the proposal and
clustered in knots talking it over Many an eye was directed on MAdam
but that little man appeared all unconscious

Weel Mr Saunderson he was saying in shrill accents and shall ye
tie Shep

What dyo think asked Rob eying the man at whom the measure was
aimed

Why its this way Im thinkin the little man replied Gin ye haud
Sheps the guilty one I _wad_ by all manner o meansor shootind be
aiblins better If not whyhe shrugged his shoulders significantly
and having shown his hand and driven the nail well home the little man
left the meeting

James Moore stayed to see the Parsons resolution negatived by a large
majority and then he too quitted the hall He had foreseen the result
and previous to the meeting had warned the Parson how it would be

Tie up he cried almost indignantly as Owd Bob came galloping up
to his whistle I think I see myself chainin yo owd lad like any
murderer Why its yo has kept the Killer off Kenmuir so far Ill
lay

At the lodgegate was MAdam for once without his familiar spirit
playing with the lodgekeepers child for the little man loved all
children but his own and was beloved of them As the Master approached
he looked up

Weel Moore he called and are you gaein to tie yer dog

I will if you will yours the Master answered grimly

Na the little man replied its Wullie as frichts the Killer aff the
Grange Thats why Ive left him there noo

Its the same wi me the Master said Hes not come to Kenmuir yet
nor hell not so long as Th Owd Uns loose I reckn

Loose or tied for the matter o that the little man rejoined
Kenmuirll escape He made the statement dogmatically snapping his
lips

The Master frowned

Why that he asked

Ha ye no heard what theyre sayin the little man inquired with
raised eyebrows

Nay what

Why that the mere repitation o th best sheepdog in the North
should keep him aff An I guess theyre reet and he laughed shrilly
as he spoke

The Master passed on puzzled

Which road are ye gaein hame MAdam called after him Because
with a polite smile Ill tak tither

Im off by the Windy Brae the Master answered striding on Squire
asked me to leave a note wi his shepherd tother side o the Chair
So he headed away to the left making for home by the route along the
Silver Mere

It is a long sweep of almost unbroken moorland the wellcalled Windy
Brae sloping gently down in mile on mile of heather from the Mere
Marches on the top to the fringe of the Silver Mere below In all that
waste of moor the only break is the quaintshaped Giants Chair
puzzle of geologists looking as though plumped down by accident in the
heathery wild The ground rises suddenly from the uniform grade of the
Brae up it goes ever growing steeper until at length it runs abruptly
into a sheer curtain of rockthe Fallwhich rises perpendicular some
forty feet on the top of which rests that tiny grassy bowlnot twenty
yards acrossthey call the Scoop

The Scoop forms the seat of the Chair and reposes on its collar of rock
cool and green and out of the world like wine in a metal cup in front
is the fortyfoot Fall behind rising sheer again the wall of rock
which makes the back of the Chair Inaccessible from above the only
means of entrance to that little dell are two narrow sheeptracks which
crawl dangerously up between the sheer wall on the one hand and the
sheer Fall on the other entering it at opposite sides

It stands out clearcut from the gradual incline that peculiar
eminence yet as the Master and Owd Bob debouched on to the Brae it was
already invisible in the darkening night

Through the heather the two swung the Master thinking now with a smile
of David and Maggie wondering what MAdam had meant musing with a
frown on the Killer pondering on his identityfor he was half of
Davids opinion as to Red Wulls innocence and thanking his stars that
so far Kenmuir had escaped a piece of luck he attributed entirely to
the vigilance of Th Owd Un who sleeping in the porch slipped out at
all hours and went his rounds warding off danger And at the thought
he looked down for the dark head which should be travelling at his knee
yet could not see it so thick hung the pall of night

So he brushed his way along and ever the night grew blacker until
from the swell of the ground beneath his feet he knew himself skirting
the Giants Chair

Now as he sped along the foot of the rise of a sudden there burst
on his ear the myriad patter of galloping feet He turned and at the
second a swirl of sheep almost bore him down It was velvetblack
and they fled furiously by yet he dimly discovered driving at their
trails a vague houndlike form

The Killer by thunder he ejaculated and startled though he was
struck down at that last pursuing shape to miss and almost fall

Bob lad he cried follow on and swung round but in the darkness
could not see if the gray dog had obeyed

The chase swept on into the night and far above him on the hillside
he could now hear the rattle of the flying feet He started hotly in
pursuit and then recognizing the futility of following where he
could not see his hand desisted So he stood motionless listening
and peering into the blackness hoping Th Owd Un was on the villains
heels

He prayed for the moon and as though in answer the lantern of the
night shone out and lit the dour face of the Chair above him He shot a
glance at his feet and thanked heaven on finding the gray dog was not
beside him

Then he looked up The sheep had broken and were scattered over the
steep hillside still galloping madly In the rout one pair of darting
figures caught and held his gaze the foremost dodging twisting
speeding upward the hinder hard on the leaders heels swift
remorseless never changing He looked for a third pursuing form but
none could he discern

He mun ha missed him in the dark the Master muttered the sweat
standing on his brow as he strained his eyes upward

Higher and higher sped those two dark specks far outtopping the
scattered remnant of the flock Up and up until of a sudden the sheer
Fall dropped its relentless barrier in the path of the fugitive Away
scudding along the foot of the rockwall struck the familiar track
leading to the Scoop and up it bleating pitifully nigh spent the
Killer hard on her now

Hell doon her in the Scoop cried the Master hoarsely following
with fascinated eyes Owd Un Owd Un wheer iver are yo gotten to he
called in agony but no Owd Un made reply

As they reached the summit just as he had prophesied the two black
dots were one and down they rolled together into the hollow of the
Scoop out of the Masters ken At the same instant the moon as though
loth to watch the last act of the bloody play veiled her face

It was his chance Nooand up the hillside he sped like a young man
girding his loins for the struggle The slope grew steep and steeper
but on and on he held in the darkness gasping painfully yet running
still until the face of the Fall blocked his way too

There he paused a moment and whistled a low call Could he but dispatch
the old dog up the one path to the Scoop while he took the other the
murderers one road to safety would be blocked

He waited all expectant but no cold muzzle was shoved into his hand
Again he whistled A pebble from above almost dropped on him as if the
criminal up there had moved to the brink of the Fall to listen and he
dared no more

He waited till all was still again then crept catlike along the
rockfoot and hit at length the track up which a while before had
fled Killer and victim Up that ragged way he crawled on hands and
knees The perspiration rolled off his face one elbow brushed the rock
perpetually one hand plunged ever and anon into that naked emptiness on
the other side

He prayed that the moon might keep in but a little longer that his feet
might be saved from falling where a slip might well mean death certain
destruction to any chance of success He cursed his luck that Th Owd Un
had somehow missed him in the dark for now he must trust to chance his
own great strength and his good oak stick And as he climbed he laid
his plan to rush in on the Killer as he still gorged and grapple
with him If in the darkness he missedand in that narrow arena the
contingency was improbablethe murderer might still in the panic of
the moment forget the one path to safety and leap over the Fall to his
destruction

At length he reached the summit and paused to draw breath The
black void before him was the Scoop and in its bosomnot ten yards
awaymust be lying the Killer and the killed

He crouched against the wet rockface and listened In that dark
silence poised twixt heaven and earth he seemed a million miles apart
from living soul

No sound and yet the murderer must be there Ay there was the tinkle
of a dislodged stone and again the tread of stealthy feet

The Killer was moving alarmed was off

Quick

He rose to his full height gathered himself and leapt

Something collided with him as he sprang something wrestled madly with
him something wrenched from beneath him and in a clap he heard
the thud of a body striking ground far below and the slithering and
splattering of some creature speeding furiously down the hillside and
away

Who the blazes roared he

What the devil screamed a little voice

The moon shone out

Moore

MAdam

And there they were still struggling over the body of a dead sheep

In a second they had disengaged and rushed to the edge of the Fall In
the quiet they could still hear the scrambling hurry of the fugitive far
below them Nothing was to be seen however save an array of startled
sheep on the hillside mute witnesses of the murderers escape

The two men turned and eyed each other the one grim the other
sardonic both dishevelled and suspicious

Well

Weel

A pause and careful scrutiny

Theres blood on your coat

And on yours

Together they walked hack into the little moonlit hollow There lay the
murdered sheep in a pool of blood Plain it was to see whence the marks
on their coats came MAdam touched the victims head with his foot The
movement exposed its throat With a shudder he replaced it as it was

The two men stood back and eyed one another

What are yo doin here

After the Killer What are you

After the Killer

Hoo did you come

Up this path pointing to the one behind him Hoo did you

Up this

Silence then again

Id ha had him but for yo

I did have him but ye tore me aff

A pause again

Wheres yer gray dog This time the challenge was unmistakable

I sent him after the Killer Wheers your Red Wull

At hame as I tellt ye before

Yo mean yo left him there MAdams fingers twitched

Hes where I left him

James Moore shrugged his shoulders And the other began

When did yer dog leave ye

When the Killer came past

Ye wad say ye missed him then

I say what I mean

Ye say he went after the Killer Noo the Killer was here pointing to
the dead sheep Was your dog here too

If he had been hed been here still

Onless he went over the Fall

That was the Killer yo fule

Or your dog

There was only _one_ beneath me I felt him

Just so said MAdam and laughed The others brow contracted

An that was a big un he said slowly The little man stopped his
cackling

There ye lie he said smoothly He was small

They looked one another full in the eyes

Thats a matter of opinion said the Master

Its a matter of fact said the other

The two stared at one another silent and stern each trying to fathom
the others soul then they turned again to the brink of the Fall
Beneath them plain to see was the splash and furrow in the shingle
marking the Killers line of retreat They looked at one another again
and then each departed the way he had come to give his version of the
story

If Th Owd Un had kept wi me I should ha had him

And

I tell ye I did have him but James Moore pulled me aff Strange too
his dog not bein wi him




Chapter XIX LAD AND LASS


AN immense sensation this affair of the Scoop created in the Daleland
It spurred the Dalesmen into fresh endeavors James Moore and MAdam
were examined and reexamined as to the minutest details of the matter
The whole countryside was placarded with huge bills offering 100
pounds reward for the capture of the criminal dead or alive While the
vigilance of the watchers was such that in a single week they bagged a
donkey an old woman and two amateur detectives

In Wastreldale the near escape of the Killer the collision between
James Moore and Adam and Owd Bobs unsuccess who was not wont to fail
aroused intense excitement with which was mingled a certain anxiety as
to their favorite

For when the Master had reached home that night he had found the old
dog already there and he must have wrenched his foot in the pursuit or
run a thorn into it for he was very lame Whereat when it was reported
at the Sylvester Arms MAdam winked at Red Wull and muttered Ah
forty foot is an ugly tumble

A week later the little man called at Kenmuir As he entered the yard
David was standing outside the kitchen window looking very glum and
miserable On seeing his father however the boy started forward all
alert

What dyo want here he cried roughly

Same as you dear lad the little man giggled advancing I come on a
visit

Your visits to Kenmuir are usually paid by night so Ive heard David
sneered

The little man affected not to hear

So they dinna allow ye indoors wi the Cup he laughed They know yer
little ways then David

Nay Im not wanted in there David answered bitterly but not so loud
that his father could hear Maggie within the kitchen heard however
but paid no heed for her heart was hard against the boy who of late
though he never addressed her had made himself as unpleasant in a
thousand little ways as only David MAdam could

At that moment the Master came stalking into the yard Owd Bob
preceding him and as the old dog recognized his visitor he bristled
involuntarily

At the sight of the Master MAdam hurried forward

I did but come to ask after the tyke he said Is he gettin over his
lameness

James Moore looked surprised then his stern face relaxed into a cordial
smile Such generous anxiety as to the welfare of Red Wulls rival was a
wholly new characteristic in the little man

I tak it kind in yo MAdam he said to come and inquire

Is the thorn oot asked the little man with eager interest shooting
his head forward to stare closely at the other

It came oot last night wi the poulticin the Master answered
returning the others gaze calm and steady

Im glad o that said the little man still staring But his yellow
grinning face said as plain words What a liar ye are James Moore

     

The days passed on His fathers taunts and gibes always becoming more
bitter drove David almost to distraction

He longed to make it up with Maggie he longed for that tender sympathy
which the girl had always extended to him when his troubles with his
father were heavy on him The quarrel had lasted for months now and
he was well weary of it and utterly ashamed For at least he had the
good grace to acknowledge that no one was to blame but himself and that
it had been fostered solely by his ugly pride

At length he could endure it no longer and determined to go to the
girl and ask forgiveness It would be a bitter ordeal to him always
unwilling to acknowledge a fault even to himself how much harder would
it be to confess it to this strip of a girl For a time he thought it
was almost more than he could do Yet like his father once set upon
a course nothing could divert him So after a week of doubts and
determinations of cowardice and courage he pulled himself together and
off he set

An hour it took him from the Grange to the bridge over the Wastrelan
hour which had wont to be a quarter Now as he walked on up the slope
from the stream very slowly heartening himself for his penance he was
aware of a strange disturbance in the yard above him the noisy cackling
of hens the snorting of pigs disturbed and above the rest the cry of a
little child ringing out in shrill distress

He set to running and sped up the slope as fast as his long legs would
carry him As he took the gate in his stride he saw the whiteclad
figure of Wee Anne fleeing with unsteady toddling steps her fair hair
streaming out behind and one bare arm striking wildly back at a great
pursuing sow

David shouted as he cleared the gate but the brute paid no heed and
was almost touching the fugitive when Owd Bob came galloping round the
corner and in a second had flashed between pursuer and pursued So
close were the two that as he swung round on the startled sow his tail
brushed the baby to the ground and there she lay kicking fat legs to
heaven and calling on all her gods

David leaving the old dog to secure the warrior pig ran round to her
but he was anticipated The whole matter had barely occupied a minutes
time and Maggie rushing from the kitchen now had the child in her
arms and was hurrying back with her to the house

Eh ma pet are yo hurted dearie David could hear her asking
tearfully as he crossed the yard and established himself in the door

Well said he in bantering tones yom a nice wench to ha charge o
oor Annie

It was a sore subject with the girl and well he knew it Wee Anne that
goldenhaired imp of mischief was forever evading her sistermothers
eye and attempting to immolate herself More than once she had only been
saved from serious hurt by the watchful devotion of Owd Bob who always
found time despite his many labors to keep a guardian eye on his
wellloved lassie In the previous winter she had been lost on a bitter
night on the Muir Pike once she had climbed into a field with the
Highland bull and barely escaped with her life while the gray dog held
the brute in check but a little while before she had been rescued from
drowning by the Tailless Tyke there had been numerous other mischances
and now the present mishap But the girl paid no heed to her tormentor
in her joy at finding the child all unhurt

Theer yo baint so much as scratted ma precious is yo she cried
Rin oot agin then and the baby toddled joyfully away

Maggie rose to her feet and stood with face averted Davids eyes dwelt
lovingly upon her admiring the pose of the neat head with its thatch of
pretty brown hair the slim figure and slender ankles peeping modestly
from beneath her print frock

Ma word if yo dad should hear tell o hoo his Anne he broke off
into a longdrawn whistle

Maggie kept silence but her lips quivered and the flush deepened on
her cheek

Im feard Ill ha to tell him the boy continued Tis but ma
duty

Yo may tell wham yo like what yo like the girl replied coldly yet
there was a tremor in her voice

First yo throws her in the stream David went on remorselessly then
yo chucks her to the pig and if it had not bin for me

Yo indeed she broke in contemptuously Yo twas Owd Bob reskied
her Yod nowt to do wi it cept lookin onbout what yore fit
for

I tell yo David pursued stubbornly an it had not bin for me yo
wouldnt have no sister by noo Shed be lyin she would pore little
lass cold as ice pore mite wi no breath in her An when yo dad
coom home thered be no Wee Anne to rin to him and climb on his knee
and yammer to him and beat his face An hed say Whats gotten to oor
Annie as I left wi yo And then yod have to tell him I never took
no manner o fash after her dad dreckly yo back was turned I

The girl sat down buried her face in her apron and indulged in the
rare luxury of tears

Yore the cruellest mon as iver was David MAdam she sobbed rocking
to and fro

He was at her side in a moment tenderly bending over her

Eh Maggie but I am sorry lass

She wrenched away from beneath his hands

I hate yo she cried passionately

He gently removed her hands from before her tearstained face

I was nobbut laffin Maggie he pleaded say yo forgie me

I dont she cried struggling I think yore the hatefullest lad as
iver lived

The moment was critical it was a time for heroic measures

No yo dont lass he remonstrated and releasing her wrists
lifted the little drooping face wet as it was like the earth after
a spring shower and holding it between his two big hands kissed it
twice

Yo coward she cried a flood of warm red crimsoning her cheeks and
she struggled vainly to be free

Yo used to let me he reminded her in aggrieved tones

I niver did she cried more indignant than truthful

Yes yo did when we was little uns that is yo was allus for
kissin and I was allus agin it And noo with wholesouled bitterness
I maynt so much as keek at yo over a stone wall

However that might be he was keeking at her from closer range now and
in that positionfor he held her firmly stillshe could not help
but keek back He looked so handsomehumble for once penitent yet
reproachful his own eyes a little moist and withal his old audacious
selfthat despite herself her anger grew less hot

Say yo forgie me and Ill let yo go

I dont nor niver shall she answered firmly but there was less
conviction in her heart than voice

Iss yo do lass he coaxed and kissed her again

She struggled faintly

Hoo daur yo she cried through her tears But he was not to be moved

Will yo noo he asked

She remained dumb and he kissed her again

Impidence she cried

Ay said he closing her mouth

I wonder at ye Davie she said surrendering

     

After that Maggie must needs give in and it was well understood though
nothing definite had been said that the boy and girl were courting And
in the Dale the unanimous opinion was that the young couple would make
a gradely pair surely

MAdam was the last person to hear the news long after it had been
common knowledge in the village It was in the Sylvester Arms he first
heard it and straightway fell into one of those foaming frenzies
characteristic of him

The dochter o Moore o Kenmuir dye say sic a dochter o sic a man
The dochter o th one man in the warld thats harmed me aboon the rest
Id no ha believed it gin yed no tellt me Oh David David Id no
ha thocht it even o you ill son as yeve aye bin to me I think he
might ha waited till his auld dad was gone and hed no had to wait
lang the noo Then the little man sat down and burst into tears
Gradually however he resigned himself and the more readily when he
realized that David by his act had exposed a fresh wound into which he
might plunge his barbed shafts And he availed himself to the full
of his new opportunities Often and often David was sore pressed to
restrain himself

Ist true what theyre sayin that Maggie Moores nae better than she
should be the little man asked one evening with anxious interest

Theyre not sayin so and if they were twad be a lie the boy
answered angrily

MAdam leant back in his chair and nodded his head

Ay they tellt me that gin ony man knew twad be David MAdam

David strode across the room

No no mair o that he shouted Yought to be shamed an owd mon
like you to speak so o a lass The little man edged close up to his
son and looked up into the fair flushed face towering above him

David he said in smooth soft tones Im stonished ye dinna strike
yen auld dad He stood with his hands clasped behind his back as if
daring the young giant to raise a finger against him Ye maist might
noo he continued suavely Ye maun be sax inches taller and a good
four stane heavier Hooiver aiblins yere wise to wait Anither year
twa Ill be an auld man as ye say and feebler and Wullie herell be
gettin on while youll be in the prime o yer strength Then I think
ye might hit me wi safety to your person and honor to yourself

He took a pace back smiling

Feyther said David huskily one day yoll drive me too far




Chapter XX THE SNAPPING OF THE STRING


THE spring was passing marked throughout with the bloody trail of
the Killer The adventure in the Scoop scared him for a while into
innocuousness then he resumed his game again with redoubled zest
It seemed likely he would harry the district till some lucky accident
carried him off for all chance there was of arresting him

You could still hear nightly in the Sylvester Arms and elsewhere the
assertion delivered with the same dogmatic certainty as of old Its
the Terror I tell yo and that irritating inevitable reply Ay but
wheers the proof While often at the same moment in a house not far
away a little lonely man was sitting before a lowburnt fire rocking
to and fro biting his nails and muttering to the great dog whose head
lay between his knees If we had but the proof Wullie if we had
but the proof Id give ma right hand aff my arm gin we had the proof
tomorrow

Long Kirby who was always for war when some one else was to do the
fighting suggested that David should be requested in the name of the
Dalesmen to tell MAdam that he must make an end to Red Wull But Jim
Mason quashed the proposal remarking truly enough that there was too
much bad blood as it was between father and son while Tammas proposed
with a sneer that the smith should be his own agent in the matter

Whether it was this remark of Tammass which stung the big man into
action or whether it was that the intensity of his hate gave him
unusual courage anyhow a few days later MAdam caught him lurking in
the granary of the Grange

The little man may not have guessed his murderous intent yet the
blacksmiths whitefaced terror as he crouched away in the darkest
corner could hardly have escaped remark thoughand Kirby may thank
his stars for itthe treacherous gleam of a gunbarrel illconcealed
behind him did

Hullo Kirby said MAdam cordially yell stay the night wi me
And the next thing the big man heard was a giggle on the far side the
door lost in the clank of padlock and rattle of chain Thenthrough
a crackGoodnight to ye Hope yell be comfie And there he stayed
that night the following day and next nightthirtysix hours in all
with swedes for his hunger and the dew off the thatch for his thirst

Meanwhile the struggle between David and his father seemed coming to a
head The little mans tongue wagged more bitterly than ever now it was
never at restsearching out sores stinging piercing

Worst of all he was continually dropping innuendoes seemingly innocent
enough yet with a world of subtile meaning at their back respecting
Maggie The leer and wink with which when David came home from
Kenmuir at nights he would ask the simple question And was she kind
Davideh eh made the boys blood boil within him

And the more effective the little man saw his shots to be the more
persistently he plied them And David retaliated in kind It was a war
of reprisals There was no peace there were no truces in which to
bury the dead before the opponents set to slaying others And every day
brought the combatants nearer to that final struggle the issue of which
neither cared to contemplate

     

There came a Saturday toward the end of the spring long to be
remembered by more than David in the Dale

For that young man the day started sensationally Rising before
cockcrow and going to the window the first thing he saw in the misty
dawn was the gaunt gigantic figure of Red Wull hounding up the hill
from the Stony Bottom and in an instant his faith was shaken to its
foundation

The dog was travelling up at a long slouching trot and as he rapidly
approached the house David saw that his flanks were all splashed with
red mud his tongue out and the foam dripping from his jaws as though
he had come far and fast

He slunk up to the house leapt on to the sill of the unused
backkitchen some five feet from the ground pushed with his paw at the
cranky old hatchment which was its only covering and in a second the
boy straining out of the window the better to see heard the rattle of
the boards as the dog dropped within the house

For the moment excited as he was David held his peace Even the Black
Killer took only second place in his thoughts that morning For this was
to be a momentous day for him

That afternoon James Moore and Andrew would he knew be over at
Grammochtown and his work finished for the day he was resolved to
tackle Maggie and decide his fate If she would have himwell he would
go next morning and thank God for it kneeling beside her in the
tiny village church if not he would leave the Grange and all its
unhappiness behind and straightway plunge out into the world

All through a week of stern work he had looked forward to this hardwon
halfholiday Therefore when as he was breaking off at noon his
father turned to him and said abruptly

David yere to tak the Cheviot lot oer to Grammochtown at once he
answered shortly

Yo mun tak em yosel if yo wish em to go today

Na the little man answered Wullie and me were busy Yere to tak
em I tell ye

Ill not David replied If they wait for me they wait till Monday
and with that he left the room

I see what tis his father called after him shes give ye a tryst
at Kenmuir Oh ye randy David

Yo tend yo business Ill tend mine the boy answered hotly

Now it happened that on the previous day Maggie had given him a
photograph of herself or rather David had taken it and Maggie had
demurred As he left the room it dropped from his pocket He failed to
notice his loss but directly he was gone MAdam pounced on it

He he Wullie whats this he giggled holding the photograph into
his face He he its the jade hersel I warnt its Jezebel

He peered into the picture

She kens whats what Ill tak oath Wullie See her eyessae saft
and languishin and her lipssuch lips Wullie He held the picture
down for the great dog to see then walked out of the room still
sniggering and chucking the face insanely beneath its cardboard chin

Outside the house he collided against David The boy had missed his
treasure and was hurrying back for it

What yo got theer he asked suspiciously

Only the pictur o some randy quean his father answered chucking
away at the inanimate chin

Gie it me David ordered fiercely Its mine

Na na the little man replied Its no for sic douce lads as dear
David to ha ony touch wi leddies sic as this

Gie it me I tell ye or Ill tak it the boy shouted

Na na its ma duty as yer dad to keep ye from sic limmers He
turned still smiling to Red Wull

There ye are Wullie He threw the photograph to the dog Tear her
Wullie the Jezebel

The Tailless Tyke sprang on the picture placed one big paw in the very
centre of the face forcing it into the muck and tore a corner off
then he chewed the scrap with unctious slobbering gluttony dropped it
and tore a fresh piece

David dashed forward

Touch it if ye daur ye brute he yelled but his father seized him
and held him back

And the dogs o the street he quoted David turned furiously on
him

Ive half a mind to brak ivery bone in yer body he shouted robbin
me o whats mine and throwin it to yon black brute

Whist David whist soothed the little man Twas but for yer ain
good yer auld dad did it Twas that he had at heart as he aye has
Rin aff wi ye noo to Kenmuir Shell mak it up to ye I warnt Shes
leeberal wi her favors I hear Yeve but to whistle and shell come

David seized his father by the shoulder

An yo gie me much more o your sauce he roared

Sauce Wullie the little man echoed in a gentle voice

Ill twist yer neck for yo

Hell twist my neck for me

Ill gang reet awa I warn yo and leave you and yer Wullie to yer
lone

The little man began to whimper

Itll brak yer auld dads heart lad he said

Nay yove got none But twill ruin yo please God For yo and
yer Wulliell get neer a soul to work for yoyo cheeseparin
dirtytongued Jew

The little man burst into an agony of affected tears rocking to and
fro his face in his hands

Waesucks Wullue dye hear him He is gaein to leave usthe son o
my bosom my Benjamin my little Davie hes gaein awa

David turned away down the hill and MAdam lifted his stricken face and
waved a hand at him

Adieu dear amiable youth he cried in broken voice and straightway
set to sobbing again

Halfway down to the Stony Bottom David turned

Ill gie yo a word o warnin he shouted back Id advise yo to
keep a closer eye to yer Wullies goings on specially o nights or
happen yoll wake to a surprise one mornin

In an instant the little man ceased his fooling

And why that he asked following down the hill

Ill tell yo When I wak this mornin I walked to the window and
what dyo think I see Why your Wullie gollopin like a good un up
from the Bottom all foamin too and redsplashed as if hed coom
from the Screes What had he bin up to Id like to know

What should he be doin the little man replied but havin an eye to
the stock and that when the Killer might be oot

David laughed harshly

Ay the Killer was oot Ill go bail and yo may hear ot afore the
evenin ma man and with that he turned away again

As he had foreseen David found Maggie alone But in the heat of his
indignation against his father he seemed to have forgotten his
original intent and instead poured his latest troubles into the girls
sympathetic ear

Theres but one mon in the world he wishes worse nor me he was
saying It was late in the afternoon and he was still inveighing
against his father and his fate Maggie sat in her fathers chair by the
fire knitting while he lounged on the kitchen table swinging his long
legs

And who may that be the girl asked

Why Mr Moore to be sure and Th Owd Un too Hed do either o them
a mischief if he could

But why David she asked anxiously Im sure dad niver hurt him or
ony ither mon for the matter o that

David nodded toward the Dale Cup which rested on the mantelpiece in
silvery majesty

Its yon done it he said And if Th Owd Un wins agin as win he
will bless him why look out for me and ma Wullie thats all

Maggie shuddered and thought of the face at the window

Me and ma Wullie David continued Ive had about as much of them
as I can swaller Its aye the sameMe and ma Wullie and Wullie and
me as if I never put ma hand to a stroke Ughhe made a gesture of
passionate disgustthe two on em fair madden me I could strike the
one and throttle tother and he rattled his heels angrily together

Hush David interposed the girl yo munna speak so o your dad
its agin the commandments

Taint agin human nature he snapped in answer Why twas nobbut
yester morn he says in his nasty way David ma gran fellow hoo ye
work ye stonish me And on ma word Maggiethere were tears in the
great boys eyesma back was nigh broke wi toilin And the Terror
he stands by and shows his teeth and looks at me as much as to say
Some day by the grace o goodness Ill ha my teeth in your throat
young mon

Maggies knitting dropped into her lap and she looked up her soft eyes
for once flashing

Its cruel David so tis she cried I wonder yo bide wi him If
he treated me so Id no stay anither minute If it meant the House for
me Id go and she looked as if she meant it

David jumped off the table

Han yo niver guessed why I stop lass and me so happy at home he
asked eagerly

Maggies eyes dropped again

Hoo should I know she asked innocently

Nor care neither I spose he said in reproachful accents Yo want
me me to go and leave yo and go reet awa I see hoo tis Yo wouldna
mind not yo if yo was niver to see pore David agin I niver thowt
yo welly like me Maggie and noo I know it

Yo silly lad the girl murmured knitting steadfastly

Then yo do he cried triumphant I knew yo did He approached
close to her chair his face clouded with eager anxiety

But dyo like me moren just _likin_ Maggie dyo he bent and
whispered in the little ear

The girl cuddled over her work so that he could not see her face

If yo wont tell me yo can show me he coaxed Theres other things
besides words

He stood before her one hand on the chairback on either side She sat
thus caged between his arms with drooping eyes and heightened color

Not so close David please she begged fidgeting uneasily but the
request was unheeded

Doee move away a wee she implored

Not till yove showed me he said relentless

I canna Davie she cried with laughing petulance

Yes yo can lass

Tak your hands away then

Nay not till yove showed me

A pause

Doee Davie she supplicated

And

Doee he pleaded

She tilted her face provokingly but her eyes were still down

Its no manner o use Davie

Iss tis he coaxed

Niver

Please

A lengthy pause

Well then She looked up at last shy trustful happy and the
sweet lips were tilted further to meet his

And thus they were situated loverlike when a low rapt voice broke in
on them

 A dearlovd lad convenience snug
A treacherous inclination

Oh Wullie I wush you were here

It was little MAdam He was leaning in at the open window leering at
the young couple his eyes puckered an evil expression on his face

The creetical moment and I interfere David yell never forgie me

The boy jumped round with an oath and Maggie her face flaming started
to her feet The tone the words the look of the little man at the
window were alike insufferable

By thunder Ill teach yo to come spyin on me roared David Above
him on the mantelpiece blazed the Shepherds Trophy Searching any
missile in his fury he reached up a hand for it

Ay gie it me back Ye robbed me ot the little man cried holding
out his arms as if to receive it

Dinna David pleaded Maggie with restraining hand on her lovers
arm

By the Lord Ill give him something yelled the boy Close by there
stood a pail of soapy water He seized it swung it and slashed its
contents at the leering face in the window

The little man started back but the dirty torrent caught him and soused
him through The bucket followed struck him full on the chest and
rolled him over in the mud After it with a rush came David

Ill let yo know spyin on me he yelled Ill

Maggie whose face was as white now as it had been crimson clung to
him hampering him

Dinna David dinna she implored Hes yer ain dad

Ill dad him Ill learn him roared David half through the window

At the moment Saml Todd came floundering furiously round the corner
closely followed by Enry and oor Job

Is he dead shouted Saml seeing the prostrate form

Ho ho went the other two

They picked up the draggled little man and hustled him out of the yard
like a thief a man on either side and a man behind

As they forced him through the gate he struggled round

By Him that made ye ye shall pay for this David MAdam you and
yer

But Samls big hand descended on his mouth and he was borne away
before that last ill word had flitted into being




Chapter XXI HORROR OF DARKNESS


IT was long past dark that night when MAdam staggered home

All that evening at the Sylvester Arms his imprecations against David
had made even the hardest shudder James Moore Owd Bob and the Dale
Cup were for once forgotten as in his passion he cursed his son

The Dalesmen gathered fearfully away from the little dripping madman
For once these men whom as a rule no such geyser outbursts could
quell were dumb before him only now and then shooting furtive glances
in his direction as though on the brink of some daring enterprise
of which he was the objective But MAdam noticed nothing suspected
nothing

When at length he lurched into the kitchen of the Grange there was no
light and the fire burnt low So dark was the room that a white riband
of paper pinned on to the table escaped his remark

The little man sat down heavily his clothes still sodden and resumed
his tireless anathema

Ive tholed mair fra him Wullie than Adam MAdam ever thocht to thole
from ony man And noo its gane past bearin He struck me Wullie
struck his ain father Ye see it yersel Wullie Na ye werena there
Oh gin ye had but bin Wullie Him and his madam But Ill gar him ken
Adam MAdam Ill stan nae mair

He sprang to his feet and reaching up with trembling hands pulled down
the old bellmouthed blunderbuss that hung above the mantelpiece

Well mak an end tot Wullie so we will aince and for a And he
banged the weapon down upon the table It lay right athwart that slip of
still condemning paper yet the little man saw it not

Resuming his seat he prepared to wait His hand sought the pocket of
his coat and fingered tenderly a small stone bottle the fond companion
of his widowhood He pulled it out uncorked it and took a long pull
then placed it on the table by his side

Gradually the gray head lolled the shrivelled hand dropped and hung
limply down the fingertips brushing the floor and he dozed off into a
heavy sleep while Red Wull watched at his feet

It was not till an hour later that David returned home

As he approached the lightless house standing in the darkness like a
body with the spirit fled he could but contrast this dreary home of his
with the bright kitchen and cheery faces he had left

Entering the house he groped to the kitchen door and opened it then
struck a match and stood in the doorway peering in

Not home baint he he muttered the tiny light above his head Wet
inside as well as oot by noo Ill lay By gum but twas a lucky thing
for him I didna get ma hand on him this evenin I could ha killed
him He held the match above his head

Two yellow eyes glowing in the darkness like cairngorms and a small
dim figure bunched up in a chair told him his surmise was wrong Many
a time had he seen his father in such case before and now he muttered
contemptuously

Drunk the leetle swab Sleepin it off I reckn

Then he saw his mistake The hand that hung above the floor twitched and
was still again

There was a clammy silence A mouse emboldened by the quiet scuttled
across the hearth One mighty paw lightly moved a lightning tap and
the tiny beast lay dead

Again that hollow stillness no sound no movement only those two
unwinking eyes fixed on him immovable

At length a small voice from the fireside broke the quiet

Drunktheleetleswab

Again a clammy silence and a lifelong pause

I thowt yo was sleepin said David at length lamely

Ay so ye said Sleepin it aff I heard ye Then still in the same
small voice now quivering imperceptibly Wad ye obleege me sir by
leetin the lamp Or dye think Wullie twad be soilin his dainty
fingers Theyre mair used Im told to danderin with the bonnie brown
hair o his

Ill not ha ye talk o ma Maggie so interposed the boy passionately

_His_ Maggie mark ye Wullie_his_ I thocht twad soon get that
far

Tak care dad Ill stan but little more the boy warned him in
choking voice and began to trim the lamp with trembling fingers

MAdam forthwith addressed himself to Red Wull

I suppose no man iver had sic a son as him Wullie Ye ken what Ive
done for him an ye ken hoo hes repaid it Hes set himsel agin
me hes miscad me hes robbed me o ma Cup last of all he struck
mestruck me afore them a Weve toiled for him you and I Wullie
weve slaved to keep him in hoose an hame an hes passed his time
the while in riotous leevin carousin at Kenmuir amusin himself
wi his He broke off short The lamp was lit and the strip of paper
pinned on to the table naked and glaring caught his eye

Whats this he muttered and unloosed the nail that clamped it down

This is what he read

Adam Mackadam yer warned to mak an end to yer Red Wull will be best
for him and the Sheep This is the first yoll have two more the third
will be the last

It was written in pencil and the only signature was a dagger rudely
lined in red

MAdam read the paper once twice thrice As he slowly assimilated
its meaning the blood faded from his face He stared at it and still
stared with whitening face and pursed lips Then he stole a glance at
Davids broad back

What dye ken o this David he asked at length in a dry thin
voice reaching forward in his chair

O what

O this holding up the slip And yeel obleege me by the truth for
once

David turned took up the paper read it and laughed harshly

Its coom to this has it he said still laughing and yet with
blanching face

Ye ken what it means I daresay ye pit it there aiblins writ it Yell
explain it The little man spoke in the same small even voice and his
eyes never moved off his sons face

Ive heard naethin Id like the truth David if ye can tell it

The boy smiled a forced unnatural smile looking from his father to the
paper in his hand

Yo shall have it but yoll not like it Its this Tupper lost a
sheep to the Killer last night

And what if he did The little man rose smoothly to his feet Each
noticed the others facedeadwhite

Why helostitonWheer dyo think He drawled the words out
dwelling almost lovingly on each

Where

OntheRedScrees

The crash was cominginevitable now David knew it knew that nothing
could avert it and braced himself to meet it The smile had fled from
his face and his breath fluttered in his throat like the wind before a
thunderstorm

What of it The little mans voice was calm as a summer sea

Why your Wullieas I told yowas on the Screes last night

Go on David

And this holding up the paper tells you that they ken as I ken
noo as maist o them ha kent this mony a day that your Wullie Red
Wullthe Terror

Go on

Is

Yes

The Black Killer

It was spoken

The frayed string was snapped at last The little mans hand flashed to
the bottle that stood before him

Yeliar he shrieked and threw it with all his strength at the boys
head David dodged and ducked and the bottle hurtled over his shoulder

Crash it whizzed into the lamp behind and broke on the wall beyond
its contents trickling down the wall to the floor

For a moment darkness Then the spirits met the lamps smouldering wick
and blazed into flame

By the sudden light David saw his father on the far side the table
pointing with crooked forefinger By his side Red Wull was standing
alert hackles up yellow fangs bared eyes lurid and at his feet the
wee brown mouse lay still and lifeless

Oot o ma hoose Back to Kenmuir Back to yer  The unpardonable
word unmistakable hovered for a second on his lips like some foul
bubble and never burst

No mither this time panted David racing round the table

Wullie

The Terror leapt to the attack but David overturned the table as
he ran the blunderbuss crashing to the floor it fell opposing a
momentary barrier in the dogs path

Stan off ye screeched the little man seizing a chair in both
hands stan off or Ill brain ye

But David was on him

Wullie Wullie to me

Again the Terror came with a roar like the sea But David with a mighty
kick catching him full on the jaw repelled the attack

Then he gripped his father round the waist and lifted him from the
ground The little man struggling in those iron arms screamed cursed
and battered at the face above him kicking and biting in his frenzy

The Killer wad ye ken whas the Killer Go and ask em at Kenmuir Ask
yer 

David swayed slightly crushing the body in his arms till it seemed
every rib must break then hurled it from him with all the might of
passion The little man fell with a crash and a groan

The blaze in the corner flared flickered and died There was
hellblack darkness and silence of the dead

David stood against the wall panting every nerve tightstrung as the
hawser of a straining ship

In the corner lay the body of his father limp and still and in the
room one other living thing was moving

He clung close to the wall pressing it with wet hands The horror of
it all the darkness the man in the corner that moving something
petrified him

Feyther he whispered

There was no reply A chair creaked at an invisible touch Something was
creeping stealing crawling closer

David was afraid

Feyther he whispered in hoarse agony are yo hurt

The words were stifled in his throat A chair overturned with a crash a
great body struck him on the chest a hot pestilent breath volleyed in
his face and wolfish teeth were reaching for his throat

Come on Killer he screamed

The horror of suspense was past It had come and with it he was himself
again

Back back back along the wall he was borne His hands entwined
themselves around a hairy throat he forced the great head with its
horrid lightsome eyes from him he braced himself for the effort lifted
the huge body at his breast and heaved it from him It struck the wall
and fell with a soft thud

As he recoiled a hand clutched his ankle and sought to trip him David
kicked back and down with all his strength There was one awful groan
and he staggered against the door and out

There he paused leaning against the wall to breathe

He struck a match and lifted his foot to see where the hand had clutched
him

God there was blood on his heel

Then a great fear laid hold on him A cry was suffocated in his breast
by the panting of his heart

He crept back to the kitchen door and listened

Not a sound

Fearfully he opened it a crack

Silence of the tomb

He banged it to It opened behind him and the fact lent wings to his
feet

He turned and plunged out into the night and ran through the blackness
for his life And a great owl swooped softly by and hooted mockingly

For your life for your life for your life




PART V OWD BOB O KENMUIR




Chapter XXII A MAN AND A MAID


IN the village even the Black Killer and the murder on the Screes were
forgotten in this new sensation The mystery in which the affair was
wrapped and the ignorance as to all its details served to whet the
general interest There had been a fight MAdam and the Terror had been
mauled and David had disappearedthose were the facts But what was
the origin of the affray no one could say

One or two of the Dalesmen had indeed a shrewd suspicion Tupper
looked guilty Jem Burton muttered I knoo hoo twould be while as
for Long Kirby he vanished entirely not to reappear till three months
had sped

Injured as he had been MAdam was yet sufficiently recovered to appear
in the Sylvester Arms on the Saturday following the battle He entered
the taproom silently with never a word to a soul one arm was in a
sling and his head bandaged He eyed every man present critically and
all except Tammas who was brazen and Jim Mason who was innocent
fidgeted beneath the stare Maybe it was well for Long Kirby he was not
there

Onythin the matter asked Jem at length rather lamely in view of
the plain evidences of battle

Na na naethin oot o the ordinar the little man replied
giggling Only David set on me and me sleepin And with a shrug
here I am noo He sat down wagging his bandaged head and grinning
Ye see hes sae playfu is Davie He wangs ye oer the head wi a
chair kicks ye in the jaw stamps on yer wame and all as merry as
May And nothing further could they get from him except that if David
reappeared it was his firm resolve to hand him over to the police for
attempted parricide

Brutal assault on an auld man by his son Twill look well in the
Argus he he They couldna let him aff under two years Im thinkin

MAdams version of the affair was received with quiet incredulity The
general verdict was that he had brought his punishment entirely on his
own head Tammas indeed who was always rude when he was not witty
and in fact the difference between the two things is only one of
degree told him straight It served yo well reet An I nobbut wish
hed made an end to yo

He did his best puir lad MAdam reminded him gently

Weve had enough o yo continued the uncompromising old man Im
fair grieved he didna slice yer throat while he was at it

At that MAdam raised his eyebrows stared and then broke into a low
whistle

Thats it is it he muttered as though a new light was dawning on
him Ah noo I see

     

The days passed on There was still no news of the missing one and
Maggies face became pitifully white and haggard

Of course she did not believe that David had attempted to murder his
father desperately tried as she knew he had been Still it was a
terrible thought to her that he might at any moment be arrested and her
girlish imagination was perpetually conjuring up horrid pictures of a
trial conviction and the things that followed

Then Saml started a wild theory that the little man had murdered his
son and thrown the mangled body down the dry well at the Grange The
story was of course preposterous and coming from such a source
might well have been discarded with the ridicule it deserved Yet it
served to set the cap on the girls fears and she resolved at whatever
cost to visit the Grange beard MAdam and discover whether he could
not or would not allay her gnawing apprehension

Her intent she concealed from her father knowing well that were she to
reveal it to him he would gently but firmly forbid the attempt and on
an afternoon some fortnight after Davids disappearance choosing her
opportunity she picked up a shawl threw it over her head and fled
with palpitating heart out of the farm and down the slope to the
Wastrel

The little plankbridge rattled as she tripped across it and she fled
faster lest any one should have heard and come to look And indeed at
the moment it rattled again behind her and she started guiltily round
It proved however to be only Owd Bob sweeping after and she was
glad

Comin wi me lad she asked as the old dog cantered up thankful to
have that gray protector with her

Round Langholm now fled the two conspirators over the summerclad lower
slopes of the Pike until at length they reached the Stony Bottom
Down the bramblecovered bank of the ravine the girl slid picked her
way from stone to stone across the streamlet tinkling in that rocky bed
and scrambled up the opposite bank

At the top she halted and looked back The smoke from Kenmuir was
winding slowly up against the sky to her right the low gray cottages of
the village cuddled in the bosom of the Dale far away over the Marches
towered the gaunt Scaur before her rolled the swelling slopes of the
Muir Pike while behindshe glanced timidly over her shoulderwas the
hill at the top of which squatted the Grange lifeless cold scowling

Her heart failed her In her whole life she had never spoken to MAdam
Yet she knew him well enough from all Davids accountsay and hated
him for Davids sake She hated him and feared him too feared him
mortallythis terrible little man And with a shudder she recalled
the dim face at the window and thought of his notorious hatred of her
father But even MAdam could hardly harm a girl coming brokenhearted
to seek her lover Besides was not Owd Bob with her

And turning she saw the old dog standing a little way up the hill
looking back at her as though he wondered why she waited Am I not
enough the faithful gray eyes seemed to say

Lad Im feard was her answer to the unspoken question

Yet that look determined her She clenched her little teeth drew the
shawl about her and set off running up the hill

Soon the run dwindled to a walk the walk to a crawl and the crawl to
a halt Her breath was coming painfully and her heart pattered against
her side like the beatings of an imprisoned bird Again her gray
guardian looked up encouraging her forward

Keep close lad she whispered starting forward afresh And the old
dog ranged up beside her shoving into her skirt as though to let her
feel his presence

So they reached the top of the hill and the house stood before them
grim unfriendly

The girls face was now quite white yet set the resemblance to her
father was plain to see With lips compressed and breath quickcoming
she crossed the threshold treading softly as though in a house of the
dead There she paused and lifted a warning finger at her companion
bidding him halt without then she turned to the door on the left of the
entrance and tapped

She listened her head buried in the shawl close to the wood panelling
There was no answer she could only hear the drumming of her heart

She knocked again From within came the scraping of a chair cautiously
shoved back followed by a deepmouthed cavernous growl

Her heart stood still but she turned the handle and entered leaving a
crack open behind

On the far side the room a little man was sitting His head was swathed
in dirty bandages and a bottle was on the table beside him He was
leaning forward his face was gray and there was a stare of naked
horror in his eyes One hand grasped the great dog who stood at his
side with yellow teeth glinting and muzzle hideously wrinkled with
the other he pointed a palsied finger at her

Ma God wha are ye he cried hoarsely

The girl stood hard against the door her fingers still on the handle
trembling like an aspen at the sight of that uncannie pair

That look in the little mans eyes petrified her the swollen pupils
lashless lids yawning wide the broken range of teeth in that gaping
mouth froze her very soul Rumors of the mans insanity tided back on
her memory

ImI the words came in trembling gasps

At the first utterance however the little mans hand dropped he leant
back in his chair and gave a soulbursting sigh of relief

No woman had crossed that threshold since his wife died and for a
moment when first the girl had entered silentfooted aroused from
dreaming of the long ago he had thought this shawlclad figure with the
pale face and peeping hair no earthly visitor the spirit rather of
one he had loved long since and lost come to reproach him with a broken
troth

Speak up I canna hear he said in tones mild compared with those
last wild words

IIm Maggie Moore the girl quavered

Moore Maggie Moore dye say he cried half rising from his chair
a flush of color sweeping across his face the dochter o James Moore
He paused for an answer glowering at her and she shrank trembling
against the door

The little man leant back in his chair Gradually a grim smile crept
across his countenance

Weel Maggie Moore he said halfamused ony gate yere a good
plucked un And his wizened countenance looked at her almost kindly
from beneath its dirty crown of bandages

At that the girls courage returned with a rush After all this little
man was not so very terrible Perhaps he would be kind And in the
relief of the moment the blood swept back into her face

There was not to be peace yet however The blush was still hot upon her
cheeks when she caught the patter of soft steps in the passage without
A dark muzzle flecked with gray pushed in at the crack of the door two
anxious gray eyes followed

Before she could wave him back Red Wull had marked the intruder With
a roar he tore himself from his masters restraining hand and dashed
across the room

Back Bob screamed Maggie and the dark head withdrew The door
slammed with a crash as the great dog flung himself against it and
Maggie was hurled breathless and whitefaced into a corner

MAdam was on his feet pointing with a shrivelled finger his face
diabolical

Did you bring him did you bring _that_ to ma door

Maggie huddled in the corner in a palsy of trepidation Her eyes gleamed
big and black in the white face peering from the shawl

Red Wull was now beside her snarling horribly With nose to the bottom
of the door and busy paws he was trying to get out while on the other
side Owd Bob snuffling also at the crack scratched and pleaded to get
in Only two miserable wooden inches separated the pair

I brought him to protect me II was afraid

MAdam sat down and laughed abruptly

Afraid I wonder ye were na afraid to bring him here Its the first
time iver hes set foot on ma land and t had best be the last He
turned to the great dog Wullie Wullie wad ye he called Come
here Lay ye doonsounder ma chairgood lad Noos no the time to
settle wi himnodding toward the door We can wait for that Wullie
we can wait Then turning to Maggie Gin ye want him to mak a show
at the Trials two months hence hed best not come here agin Gin he
does hell no leave ma land alive Wulliell see to that Noo what is
t ye want ome

The girl in the corner scared almost out of her senses by this last
occurrence remained dumb

MAdam marked her hesitation and grinned sardonically

I see hoo tis said he yer dads sent ye Aince before he wanted
somethin o me and did he come to fetch it himself like a man Not he
He sent the son to rob the father Then leaning forward in his chair
and glaring at the girl Ay and mair than that The night the lad
set on me he camwith hissing emphasisstraight from Kenmuir He
paused and stared at her intently and she was still dumb before him
Gin Id ben killed Wullied ha bin disqualified from competin for
the Cup With Adam MAdams Red Wull oot o the waynoo dye see Noo
dye onderstan

She did not and he saw it and was satisfied What he had been saying
she neither knew nor cared She only remembered the object of her
mission she only saw before her the father of the man she loved and a
wave of emotion surged up in her breast

She advanced timidly toward him holding out her hands

Eh Mr MAdam she pleaded I come to ask ye after David The shawl
had slipped from her head and lay loose upon her shoulders and she
stood before him with her sad face her pretty hair all tossed and her
eyes big with unshed tearsa touching suppliant

Will ye no tell me wheer he is Id not ask it Id not trouble yo
but Ive bin waitin a waefu while it seems and Im wearyin for news
o him

The little man looked at her curiously Ah noo I mind methis to
himself You the lass as is thinkin o marryin him

Were promised the girl answered simply

Weel the other remarked as I said afore yere a good plucked un
Then in a tone in which despite the cynicism a certain indefinable
sadness was blended Gin he maks you as good husband as he mad son to
me yell ha made a maist remairkable match my dear

Maggie fired in a moment

A good feyther makes a good son she answered almost pertly and then
with infinite tenderness and Im prayin a good wifell make a good
husband

He smiled scoffingly

Im feared thatll no help ye much he said

But the girl never heeded this last sneer so set was she on her
purpose She had heard of the one tender place in the heart of this
little man with the tired face and mocking tongue and she resolved to
attain her end by appealing to it

Yo loved a lass yosel aince Mr MAdam she said Hoo would yo
ha felt had she gone away and left yo Yod ha bin mad yo know yo
would And Mr MAdam I love the lad yer wife loved She was kneeling
at his feet now with both hands on his knees looking up at him Her sad
face and quivering lips pleaded for her more eloquently than any words

The little man was visibly touched

Ay ay lass thats enough he said trying to avoid those big
beseeching eyes which would not be avoided

Will ye no tell me she pleaded

I canna tell ye lass for why I dinna ken he answered querulously
In truth he was moved to the heart by her misery

The girls last hopes were dashed She had played her last card and
failed She had clung with the fervor of despair to this last resource
and now it was torn from her She had hoped and now there was no hope
In the anguish of her disappointment she remembered that this was the
man who by his persistent cruelty had driven her love into exile

She rose to her feet and stood back

Nor ken nor care she cried bitterly

At the words all the softness fled from the little mans face

Ye do me a wrang lass ye do indeed he said looking up at her with
an assumed ingenuousness which had she known him better would have
warned her to beware Gin I kent where the lad was Id be the vairy
first to let you and the plice ken it too eh Wullie he he He
chuckled at his wit and rubbed his knees regardless of the contempt
blazing in the girls face

I canna tell ye where he is now but yed aiblins care to hear o when
I saw him last He turned his chair the better to address her

Twas like so I was sittin in this vairy chair it was asleep when
he crep up behind an lep on ma back I knew naethin ot till I found
masel on the floor an him kneelin on me I saw by the look on him he
was set on finishin me so I said

The girl waved her hand at him superbly disdainful

Yo ken yore lyin ivery word ot she cried

The little man hitched his trousers crossed his legs and yawned

An honest lee for an honest purpose is a matter ony man may be proud
of as youll ken by the time youre my years ma lass

The girl slowly crossed the room At the door she turned

Then yell no tell me wheer he is she asked with a heartbreaking
trill in her voice

On ma word lass I dinna ken he cried half passionately

On your word Mr MAdam she said with a quiet scorn in her voice that
might have stung Iscariot

The little man spun round in his chair an angry red dyeing his cheeks
In another moment he was suave and smiling again

I canna tell ye where he is noo he said unctuously but aiblins I
could let ye know where hes gaein to

Can yo will yo cried the simple girl all unsuspecting In a moment
she was across the room and at his knees

Closer and Ill whisper The little ear peeping from its nest of
brown was tremblingly approached to his lips The little man lent
forward and whispered one short sharp word then sat back grinning to
watch the effect of his disclosure

He had his revenge an unworthy revenge on such a victim And watching
the girls face the cruel disappointment merging in the heat of her
indignation he had yet enough nobility to regret his triumph

She sprang from him as though he were unclean

An yo his father she cried in burning tones

She crossed the room and at the door paused Her face was white again
and she was quite composed

If David did strike you you drove him to it she said speaking in
calm gentle accents Yo know none so well whether yove bin a good
feyther to him and him no mither poor laddie Whether yove bin to him
what shed ha had yo be Ask yer conscience Mr MAdam An if he
was a wee aggravatin at times had he no reason Hed a heavy cross to
bear had David and yo know best if yo helped to ease it for him

The little man pointed to the door but the girl paid no heed

Dyo think when yo were cruel to him jeerin and fleerin he never
felt it because he was too proud to show ye Hed a big saft heart had
David beneath the varnish Monys the time when mither was alive Ive
seen him throw himsel into her arms sobbin and cry Eh if I had
but mither Twas different when mither was alive he was kinder to me
then An noo Ive no one Im alone An hed sob and sob in mithers
arms and she weepin hersel would comfort him while he wee laddie
would no be comforted cryin brokenlike Theres none to care for me
noo Im alone Mithers left me and eh Im prayin to be wi her

The clear girlish voice shook MAdam sitting with face averted
waved to her mutely ordering her to be gone But she held on gentle
sorrowful relentless

An whatll yo say to his mither when yo meet her as yo must soon
noo and she asks yo An what o David What o th lad I left wi
yo Adam to guard and keep for me faithful and true till this Day
And then yoll ha to speak the truth Gods truth and yoll ha to
answer Sin the day yo left me I niver said a kind word to the lad
I niver bore wi him and niver tried to And in the end I drove him by
persecution to try and murder me Then maybe shell look at yoyo
best ken hooand shell say Adam Adam is this what I deserved fra
yo

The gentle implacable voice ceased The girl turned and slipped softly
out of the room and MAdam was left alone to his thoughts and his dead
wifes memory

Mither and father baith Mither and father baith rang remorselessly
in his ears




Chapter XXIII TH OWD UN


THE Black Killer still cursed the land Sometimes there would be a
cessation in the crimes then a shepherd going his rounds would notice
his sheep herding together packing in unaccustomed squares a raven
gorged to the crop would rise before him and flap wearily away and he
would come upon the murderers latest victim

The Dalesmen were in despair so utterly futile had their efforts been
There was no proof no hope no apparent probability that the end was
near As for the Tailless Tyke the only piece of evidence against him
had flown with David who as it chanced had divulged what he had seen
to no man

The 100 pound reward offered had brought no issue The police had done
nothing The Special Commissioner had been equally successful After
the affair in the Scoop the Killer never ran a risk yet never missed a
chance

Then as a last resource Jim Mason made his attempt He took a holiday
from his duties and disappeared into the wilderness Three days and
three nights no man saw him

On the morning of the fourth he reappeared haggard unkempt a furtive
look haunting his eyes sullen for once irritable who had never been
irritable beforeto confess his failure Crossexamined further he
answered with unaccustomed fierceness I seed nowt I tell ye Whos
the liar as said I did

But that night his missus heard him in his sleep conning over something
to himself in slow fearful whisper Two on em one ahint tother The
first bigbulllike tither At which point Mrs Mason smote him a
smashing blow in the ribs and he woke in a sweat crying terribly Who
said I seed

     

The days were slipping away the summer was hot upon the land and with
it the Black Killer was forgotten David was forgotten everything
sank into oblivion before the allabsorbing interest of the coming Dale
trials

The longanticipated battle for the Shepherds Trophy was looming close
soon everything that hung upon the issue of that struggle would be
decided finally For ever the justice of Th Owd Un claim to his
proud title would be settled If he won he won outrighta thing
unprecedented in the annals of the Cup if he won the place of Owd Bob
o Kenmuir as first in his profession was assured for all time Above
all it was the last event in the six years struggle twixt Red and
Gray It was the last time those two great rivals would meet in battle
The supremacy of one would be decided once and for all For win or lose
it was the last public appearance of the Gray Dog of Kenmuir

And as every hour brought the great day nearer nothing else was talked
of in the countryside The heat of the Dalesmens enthusiasm was only
intensified by the fever of their apprehension Many a man would lose
more than he cared to contemplate were Th Owd Un beat But hed not be
Nay owd indeed he wastwo years older than his great rival there
were a hundred risks a hundred chances still Whats the odds agin
Owd Bob o Kenmuir Im takin em Wholl lay agin Th Owd Un

And with the air saturated with this perpetual talk of the old dog
these everlasting references to his certain victory his ears drumming
with the often boast that the gray dog was the best in the North
MAdam became the silent illdesigning man of six months sincemorose
brooding suspicious muttering of conspiracy plotting revenge

The scenes at the Sylvester Arms were replicas of those of previous
years Usually the little man sat isolated in a far corner silent
and glowering with Red Wull at his feet Now and then he burst into
a paroxysm of insane giggling slapping his thigh and muttering
Ay its likely theyll beat us Wullie Yet aiblins theres a wee
somethina somethin we ken and they dinna Wullieeh Wullie he
he And sometimes he would leap to his feet and address his pothouse
audience appealing to them passionately satirically tearfully as the
mood might be on him and his theme was always the same James Moore
Owd Bob the Cup and the plots agin him and his Wullie and always he
concluded with that hint of the surprise to come

Meantime there was no news of David he had gone as utterly as a ship
foundered in midAtlantic Some said hed listed some that hed gone
to sea And So he as corroborated Saml floatin eels uppards

With no gleam of consolation Maggies misery was such as to rouse
compassion in all hearts She went no longer blithely singing about
her work and all the springiness had fled from her gait The people of
Kenmuir vied with one another in their attempts to console their young
mistress

     

Maggie was not the only one in whose life Davids absence had created
a void Last as he would have been to own it MAdam felt acutely the
boys loss It may have been he missed the everpresent butt it may
have been a nobler feeling Alone with Red Wull too late he felt his
loneliness Sometimes sitting in the kitchen by himself thinking of
the past he experienced sharp pangs of remorse and this was all the
more the case after Maggies visit Subsequent to that day the little
man to do him justice was never known to hint by word or look an ill
thing of his enemys daughter Once indeed when Melia Ross was drawing
on a dirty imagination with Maggie for subject MAdam shut her up with
Yere a maist amazin big liar Melia Ross

Yet though for the daughter he had now no evil thought his hatred for
the father had never been so uncompromising

He grew reckless in his assertions His life was one long threat against
James Moores Now he openly stated his conviction that on the eventful
night of the fight James Moore with object easily discernible had
egged David on to murder him

Then why dont yo go and tell him so yo muckle liar roared Tammas
at last enraged to madness

I will said MAdam And he did

     

It was on the day preceding the great summer sheep fair at Grammochtown
that he fulfilled his vow

That is always a big fieldday at Kenmuir and on this occasion James
Moore and Owd Bob had been up and working on the Pike from the rising of
the sun Throughout the straggling lands of Kenmuir the Master went
with his untiring adjutant rounding up cutting out drafting It was
already noon when the flock started from the yard

On the gate by the stile as the party came up sat MAdam

Ive a word to say to you James Moore he announced as the Master
approached

Say it then and quick Ive no time to stand gossipin here if yo
have said the Master

MAdam strained forward till he nearly toppled off the gate

Queer thing James Moore you should be the only one to escape this
Killer

Yo forget yoursel MAdam

Ay theres me acquiesced the little man But youhoo dyo count
for _your_ luck

James Moore swung round and pointed proudly at the gray dog now
patrolling round the flock

Theres my luck he said

MAdam laughed unpleasantly

So I thought he said so I thought And I spose yere thinkin that
yer luck nodding at the gray dog will win you the Cup for certain a
month hence

I hope so said the Master

Strange if he should not after all mused the little man

James Moore eyed him suspiciously What dyo mean he asked sternly
MAdam shrugged his shoulders Theres mony a slip twixt Cup and lip
thats a I was thinkin some mischance might come to him

The Masters eyes flashed dangerously He recalled the many rumors he
had heard and the attempt on the old dog early in the year

I canna think ony one would be coward enough to murder him he said
drawing himself up

MAdam leant forward There was a nasty glitter in his eye and his face
was all atremble

Yed no think ony one d be cooard enough to set the son to murder the
father Yet some one didset the lad on to sassinate me He failed at
me and next I suppose hell try at Wullie There was a flush on
the sallow face and a vindictive ring in the thin voice One way or
tither fair or foul Wullie or me ain or baith has got to go afore
Cup Day eh James Moore eh

The Master put his hand on the latch of the gate Thatll do MAdam
he said Ill stop to hear no more else I might get angry wi yo Noo
git off this gate yore trespassin as tis

He shook the gate MAdam tumbled off and went sprawling into the sheep
clustered below Picking himself up he dashed on through the flock
waving his arms kicking fantastically and scattering confusion
everywhere

Just wait till Im thro wi em will yo shouted the Master seeing
the danger

It was a request which according to the etiquette of shepherding one
man was bound to grant another But MAdam rushed on regardless dancing
and gesticulating Save for the lightning vigilance of Owd Bob the
flock must have broken

I think yo might ha waited remonstrated the Master as the little
man burst his way through

Noo Ive forgot somethin the other cried and back he started as he
had gone

It was more than human nature could tolerate

Bob keep him off

A flash of teeth a blaze of gray eyes and the old dog had leapt
forward to oppose the little mans advance

Shift oot o ma light cried he striving to dash past

Hold him lad

And hold him the old dog did while his master opened the gate and put
the flock through the opponents dodging in front of one another like
opposing threequarterbacks at the Rugby game

Oot o ma path or Ill strike shouted the little man in a fury as
the last sheep passed through the gate

Id not warned the Master

But I will yelled MAdam and darting forward as the gate swung to
struck furiously at his opponent

He missed and the gray dog charged at him like a mailtrain

Hi James Moore but over he went like a toppled wheelbarrow while
the old dog turned again raced at the gate took it magnificently in
his stride and galloped up the lane after his master

At MAdams yell James Moore had turned

Served yo properly he called back Hell larn ye yet its not wise
to tamper wi a gray dog or his sheep Not the first time hes downed
ye Im thinkin

The little man raised himself painfully to his elbow and crawled toward
the gate The Master up the lane could hear him cursing as he dragged
himself Another moment and a head was poked through the bars of the
gate and a devilish little face looked after him

Downed me by he did the little man cried passionately I owed ye
baith somethin before this and noo by  I owe ye somethin more
An mind ye Adam MAdam pays his debts

Ive heard the contrary the Master replied drily and turned away up
the lane toward the Marches




Chapter XXIV A SHOT IN THE NIGHT


IT was only three short weeks before Cup Day that one afternoon Jim
Mason brought a letter to Kenmuir James Moore opened it as the postman
still stood in the door

It was from Long Kirbystill in retirementbegging him for mercys
sake to keep Owd Bob safe within doors at nights at all events till
after the great event was over For Kirby knew as did every Dalesman
that the old dog slept in the porch between the two doors of the house
of which the outer was only loosely closed by a chain so that the
everwatchful guardian might slip in and out and go his rounds at any
moment of the night

This was how the smith concluded his illspelt note Look out for
MAdam i tell you i _know_ hel tri at thowd un afore cup dayfailin im
you if the ole dogs bete im a ruined man i say so for the luv o God
keep yer eyes wide

The Master read the letter and handed it to the postman who perused it
carefully

I tell yo what said Jim at length speaking with an earnestness that
made the other stare I wish yod do what he asks yo keep Th Owd Un
in o nights I mean just for the present

The Master shook his head and laughed tearing the letter to pieces

Nay said he MAdam or no MAdam Cup or no Cup Th Owd Un has the
run o ma land same as hes had since a puppy Why Jim the first night
I shut him up that night the Killer comes Ill lay

The postman turned wearily away and the Master stood looking after him
wondering what had come of late to his former cheery friend

Those two were not the only warnings James Moore received During
the weeks immediately preceding the Trials the danger signal was
perpetually flaunted beneath his nose

Twice did Watch the black crossbred chained in the strawyard hurl a
brazen challenge on the night air Twice did the Master with lantern
Saml and Owd Bob sally forth and search every hole and corner on the
premisesto find nothing One of the dairymaids gave notice avowing
that the farm was haunted that on several occasions in the early
morning she had seen a bogie flitting down the slope to the Wastrela
sure portent Saml declared of an approaching death in the house
While once a shearer coming up from the village reported having seen
in the twilight of dawn a little ghostly figure haggard and startled
stealing silently from tree to tree in the larchcopse by the lane The
Master however irritated by these constant alarms dismissed the story
summarily

One thing Im sartin o said he Theres not a critter moves on
Kenmuir at nights but Th Owd Un knows it

Yet even as he said it a little man draggled wearyeyed smeared
with dew and dust was limping in at the door of a house barely a mile
away Nae luck Wullie curse it he cried throwing himself into a
chair and addressing some one who was not therenae luck An yet Im
sure ot as I am that theres a God in heaven

     

MAdam had become an old man of late But little more than fifty yet he
looked to have reached mans allotted years His sparse hair was quite
white his body shrunk and bowed and his thin hand shook like an aspen
as it groped to the familiar bottle

In another matter too he was altogether changed Formerly whatever
his faults there had been no harderworking man in the countryside
At all hours in all weathers you might have seen him with his gigantic
attendant going his rounds Now all that was different he never put his
hand to the plough and with none to help him the land was left wholly
untended so that men said that of a surety there would be a farm to
let on the March Mere Estate come Michaelmas

Instead of working the little man sat all day in the kitchen at home
brooding over his wrongs and brewing vengeance Even the Sylvester
Arms knew him no more for he stayed where he was with his dog and his
bottle Only when the shroud of night had come down to cover him
he slipped out and away on some errand on which not even Red Wull
accompanied him

     

So the time glided on till the Sunday before the Trials came round

All that day MAdam sat in his kitchen drinking muttering hatching
revenge

Curse it Wullie curse it The times slippinslippinslippin
Thursday nextbut three days mair and I haena the proofI haena the
proofand he rocked to and fro biting his nails in the agony of his
impotence

All day long he never moved Long after sunset he sat on long after
dark had eliminated the features of the room

Theyre all agin us Wullie Its you and I alane lad MAdams to be
beat somehow onyhow and Moores to win So theyve settled it and
so twill beonless Wullie onlessbut curse it Ive no the
proofand he hammered the table before him and stamped on the floor

At midnight he arose a mad desperate plan looming through his fuddled
brain

I swore Id pay him Wullie and I will If I hang for it Ill be even
wi him I haena the proof but I _know_I _know_ He groped his way
to the mantel piece with blind eyes and swirling brain Reaching up
with fumbling hands he took down the old blunderbuss from above the
fireplace

Wullie he whispered chuckling hideously Wullie come on You and
Ihe he But the Tailless Tyke was not there At nightfall he had
slouched silently out of the house on business he best wot of So his
master crept out of the room aloneon tiptoe still chuckling

The cool night air refreshed him and he stepped stealthily along
his quaint weapon over his shoulder down the hill across the Bottom
skirting the Pike till he reached the plankbridge over the Wastrel

He crossed it safely that Providence whose care is drunkards placing
his footsteps Then he stole up the slope like a hunter stalking his
prey

Arrived at the gate he raised himself cautiously and peered over into
the moonlit yard There was no sign or sound of living creature The
little gray house slept peacefully in the shadow of the Pike all
unaware of the man with murder in his heart laboriously climbing the
yardgate

The door of the porch was wide the chain hanging limply down unused
and the little man could see within the moon shining on the iron studs
of the inner door and the blanket of him who should have slept there
and did not

Hes no there Wullie Hes no there He jumped down from the gate
Throwing all caution to the winds he reeled recklessly across the yard
The drunken delirium of battle was on him The fever of anticipated
victory flushed his veins At length he would take toll for the injuries
of years

Another moment and he was in front of the good oak door battering at
it madly with clubbed weapon yelling dancing screaming vengeance

Where is he Whats he at Come and tell me that James Moore Come
doon I say ye coward Come and meet me like a man

 Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled
 Scots wham Bruce has aften led
 Welcome to your gory bed
 Or to victorie

The soft moonlight streamed down on the whitehaired madman thundering
at the door screaming his warsong

The quiet farmyard startled from its sleep awoke in an uproar Cattle
shifted in their stalls horses whinnied fowls chattered aroused by
the din and dull thudding of the blows and above the rest loud and
piercing the shrill cry of a terrified child

Maggie wakened from a vivid dream of David chasing the police hurried
a shawl around her and in a minute had the baby in her arms and was
comforting hervaguely fearing the while that the police were after
David

James Moore flung open a window and leaning out looked down on the
dishevelled figure below him

MAdam heard the noise glanced up and saw his enemy Straightway he
ceased his attack on the door and running beneath the window shook
his weapon up at his foe

There ye are are ye Curse ye for a coward curse ye for a liar Come
doon I say James Moore come doonI daur ye to it Aince and for a
lets settle oor account

The Master looking down from above thought that at length the little
mans brain had gone

What ist yo want he asked as calmly as he could hoping to gain
time

What ist I want screamed the madman Hark to him He crosses me in
ilka thing he plots agin me he robs me o ma Cup he sets ma son agin
me and pits him on to murder me And in the end he

Coom then coom Ill

Gie me back the Cup ye stole James Moore Gie me back ma son yeve
took from me And theres anither thing Whats yer gray dog doin
Wheres yer

The Master interposed again

Ill coom doon and talk things over wi yo he said soothingly But
before he could withdraw MAdam had jerked his weapon to his shoulder
and aimed it full at his enemys head

The threatened man looked down the guns great quivering mouth wholly
unmoved

Yo mon hold it steadier little mon if yod hit he said grimly
There Ill coom help yo He withdrew slowly and all the time was
wondering where the gray dog was

In another moment he was downstairs undoing the bolts and bars of the
door On the other side stood MAdam his blunderbuss at his shoulder
his finger trembling on the trigger waiting

Hi Master Stop or yore dead roared a voice from the loft on the
other side the yard

Feyther feyther git yo back screamed Maggie who saw it all from
the window above the door

Their cries were too late The blunderbuss went off with a roar
belching out a storm of sparks and smoke The shot peppered the door
like hail and the whole yard seemed for a moment wrapped in flame

Aw oh ma gummy Am waounded Am a goner Am shot Elp Murder Eh
Oh bellowed a lusty voiceand it was not James Moores

The little man the cause of the uproar lay quite still upon the
ground with another figure standing over him As he had stood finger
on trigger waiting for that last bolt to be drawn a gray form
shooting whence no one knew had suddenly and silently attacked him from
behind and jerked him backward to the ground With the shock of the
fall the blunderbuss had gone off

The last bolt was thrown back with a clatter and the Master emerged In
a glance he took in the whole scene the fallen man the gray dog the
stillsmoking weapon

Yo wast Bob lad he said I was wonderin wheer yo were Yo
came just at the reet moment as yo aye do Then in a loud voice
addressing the darkness Yore not hurt Saml ToddI can tell that
by yer noise it was nobbut the shot off the door warmed yo Coom away
doon and gie me a hand

He walked up to MAdam who still lay gasping on the ground The shock
of the fall and recoil of the weapon had knocked the breath out of the
little mans body beyond that he was barely hurt

The Master stood over his fallen enemy and looked sternly down at him

Ive put up wi more from you MAdam than I would from ony other
man he said But this is too muchcomin here at night wi loaded
arms scarin the wimmen and childer oot o their lives and I can
but think meanin worse If yo were half a man Id gie yo the finest
thrashin iver yo had in yer life But as yo know well I could no
more hit yo than I could a woman Why yove got this down on me yo ken
best I niver did yo or ony ither mon a harm As to the Cup Ive got
it and Im goin to do ma best to keep itits for yo to win it from
me if yo can o Thursday As for what yo say o David yo know its a
lie And as for what yore drivin at wi yer hints and mysteries Ive
no more idee than a babe unborn Noo Im goin to lock yo up yore not
safe abroad Im thinkin Ill ha to hand ye oer to the plice

With the help of Saml he half dragged half supported the
stunned little man across the yard and shoved him into a tiny
semisubterraneous room used for the storage of coal at the end of the
farmbuildings

Yo think it over that side ma lad called the Master grimly as he
turned the key and I will this And with that he retired to bed

     

Early in the morning he went to release his prisoner But he was a
minute too late For scuttling down the slope and away was a little
blackbegrimed tottering figure with white hair blowing in the wind
The little man had broken away a wooden hatchment which covered a
manhole in the wall of his prisonhouse squeezed his small body
through and so escaped

Happen its as well thought the Master watching the flying figure
Then Hi Bob lad he called for the gray dog ears back tail
streaming was hurling down the slope after the fugitive

On the bridge MAdam turned and seeing his pursuer hot upon him
screamed missed his footing and fell with a loud splash into the
streamalmost in that identical spot into which years before he had
plunged voluntarily to save Red Wull

On the bridge Owd Bob halted and looked down at the man struggling in
the water below He made a half move as though to leap in to the rescue
of his enemy then seeing it was unnecessary turned and trotted back
to his master

Yo nobbut served him right Im thinkin said the Master Like
as not he came here wi the intent to mak an end to yo Well after
Thursday I pray God well ha peace Its gettin above a joke The
two turned back into the yard

But down below them along the edge of the stream for the second time
in this story a little dripping figure was tottering homeward The
little man was cryingthe hot tears mingling on his cheeks with
the undried waters of the Wastrelcrying with rage mortification
weariness




Chapter XXV THE SHEPHERDS TROPHY

Cup Day


It broke calm and beautiful no cloud on the horizon no threat of storm
in the air a fitting day on which the Shepherds Trophy must be won
outright

And well it was so For never since the founding of the Dale Trials had
such a concourse been gathered together on the North bank of the Silver
Lea From the Highlands they came from the far Campbell country from
the Peak from the county of many acres from all along the silver
fringes of the Solway assembling in that quiet corner of the earth to
see the famous Gray Dog of Kenmuir fight his last great battle for the
Shepherds Trophy

By noon the gaunt Scaur looked down on such a gathering as it had never
seen The paddock at the back of the Dalesmans Daughter was packed with
a clammering chattering multitude animated groups of farmers bevies
of solid rustics sharpfaced townsmen loudvoiced bookmakers giggling
girls amorous boysthrown together like toys in a sawdust bath
whilst here and there on the outskirts of the crowd a lonely man and
wisefaced dog come from afar to wrest his proud title from the best
sheepdog in the North

At the back of the enclosure was drawn up a formidable array of carts
and carriages varying as much in quality and character as did their
owners There was the squires landau rubbing axleboxes with Jem
Burtons modest mokecart and there Viscount Birdsayes flaring
barouche side by side with the redwheeled wagon of Kenmuir

In the latter Maggie sad and sweet in her simple summer garb leant
over to talk to Lady Eleanour while goldenhaired wee Anne delighted
with the surging crowd around trotted about the wagon waving to her
friends and shouting from very joyousness

Thick as flies clustered that motley assembly on the north bank of the
Silver Lea While on the other side the stream was a little group of
judges inspecting the course

The line laid out ran thus the sheep must first be found in the big
enclosure to the right of the starting flag then up the slope and away
from the spectators around a flag and obliquely down the hill again
through a gap in the wall along the hillside parrallel to the Silver
Lea abruptly to the left through a pair of flagsthe trickiest turn of
them all then down the slope to the pen which was set up close to the
bridge over the stream

The proceedings began with the Local Stakes won by Rob Saundersons
veteran Shep There followed the Open Juveniles carried off by Ned
Hoppins young dog It was late in the afternoon when at length the
great event of the meeting was reached

In the enclosure behind the Dalesmans Daughter the clamor of the crowd
increased tenfold and the yells of the bookmakers were redoubled

Walk up genlemen walk up the ole firm Rasper Yessirtwenty to
one bar two Twenty to one bar two Bob What price Bob Even money
sirno not a penny longer couldnt do it Red Wull oo says Red
Wull

On the far side the stream is clustered about the starting flag the
finest array of sheepdogs ever seen together

Ive never seen such a field and Ive seen fifty is Parson Leggys
verdict

There beside the tall form of his master stands Owd Bob o Kenmuir
the observed of all His silvery brush fans the air and he holds his
dark head high as he scans his challengers proudly conscious that
today will make or mar his fame Below him the meanlooking
smoothcoated black dog is the unbeaten Pip winner of the renowned
Cambrian Stakes at Llangollenas many think the best of all the good
dogs that have come from sheepdotted Wales Beside him that handsome
sable collie with the tremendous coat and slash of white on throat
and face is the famous MacCallum More fresh from his victory at the
Highland meeting The cobby brown dog seeming of many breeds is from
the land o the TykesMerry on whom the Yorkshiremen are laying as
though they loved him And Jess the wiry blackandtan is the favorite
of the men of of the Derwent and Dove Tuppers big blue Rasper is
there Londesleys Lassie and many moretoo many to mention big and
small grand and mean smooth and roughand not a bad dog there

And alone his back to the others stands a little bowed conspicuous
figureAdam MAdam while the great dog beside him a hideous
incarnation of scowling defiance is Red Wull the Terror o the Border

The Tailless Tyke had already run up his fighting colors For MacCallum
More going up to examine this forlorn great adversary had conceived
for him a violent antipathy and straightway had spun at him with
all the fury of the Highland cateran who attacks first and explains
afterward Red Wull forthwith had turned on him with savage silent
gluttony bobtailed Rasper was racing up to join in the attack and in
another second the three would have been locked inseparablybut just in
time MAdam intervened One of the judges came hurrying up

Mr MAdam he cried angrily if that brute of yours gets fighting
again hang me if I dont disqualify him Only last year at the Trials
he killed the young Cossack dog

A dull flash of passion swept across MAdams face Come here
Wullie he called Gin yon Hielant tyke attacks ye agin yere to be
disqualified

He was unheeded The battle for the Cup had begunlittle Pip leading
the dance

On the opposite slope the babel had subsided now Hucksters left their
wares and bookmakers their stools to watch the struggle Every eye
was intent on the moving figures of man and dog and three sheep over the
stream

One after one the competitors ran their course and penned their
sheepthere was no single failure And all received their just meed of
applause save only Adam MAdams Red Wull

Last of all when Owd Bob trotted out to uphold his title there went up
such a shout as made Maggies wan cheeks to blush with pleasure and wee
Anne to scream right lustily

His was an incomparable exhibition Sheep should be humored rather than
hurried coaxed rather than coerced And that sheepdog has attained
the summit of his art who subdues his own personality and leads his
sheep in pretending to be led Well might the bosoms of the Dalesmen
swell with pride as they watched their favorite at his work well might
Tammas pull out that hackneyed phrase The brains of a mon and the way
of a woman well might the crowd bawl their enthusiasm and Long Kirby
puff his cheeks and rattle the money in his trouser pockets

But of this part it is enough to say that Pip Owd Bob and Red Wull
were selected to fight out the struggle afresh

The course was altered and stiffened On the far side the stream it
remained as before up the slope round a flag down the hill again
through the gap in the wall along the hillside down through the two
flags turn and to the stream again But the pen was removed from its
former position carried over the bridge up the near slope and the
hurdles put together at the very foot of the spectators

The sheep had to be driven over the plank bridge and the penning done
beneath the very nose of the crowd A stiff course if ever there was
one and the time allowed ten short minutes

     

The spectators hustled and elbowed in their endeavors to obtain a
good position And well they might for about to begin was the finest
exhibition of sheephandling any man there was ever to behold

     

Evan Jones and Little Pip led off

Those two who had won on many a hardfought field worked together
as they had never worked before Smooth and swift like a yacht in
Southampton Water round the flag through the gap they brought their
sheep Down between the two flagsaccomplishing right well that awkward
turn and back to the bridge

There they stopped the sheep would not face that narrow way Once
twice and again they broke and each time the gallant little Pip his
tongue out and tail quivering brought them back to the bridgehead

At length one faced it then another andit was too late Time was up
The judges signalled and the Welshman called off his dog and withdrew

Out of sight of mortal eye in a dip of the ground Evan Jones sat down
and took the small dark head between his kneesand you may be sure the
dogs heart was heavy as the mans We did our pest Pip he cried
brokenly but were peatthe first time ever weve been

     

No time to dally

James Moore and Owd Bob were off on their last run

No applause this time not a voice was raised anxious faces twitching
fingers the whole crowd tense as a stretched wire A false turn a
wilful sheep a cantankerous judge and the gray dog would be beat And
not a man there but knew it

Yet over the stream master and dog went about their business never
so quiet never so collected for all the world as though they were
rounding up a flock on the Muir Pike

The old dog found his sheep in a twinkling and a wild scared trio they
proved Rounding the first flag one brighteyed wether made a dash
for the open He was quick but the gray dog was quicker a splendid
recover and a sound like a sob from the watchers on the hill

Down the slope they came for the gap in the wall A little below the
opening James Moore took his stand to stop and turn them while a
distance behind his sheep loitered Owd Bob seeming to follow rather
than drive yet watchful of every movement and anticipating it On he
came one eye on his master the other on his sheep never hurrying
them never flurrying them yet bringing them rapidly along

No word was spoken barely a gesture made yet they worked master and
dog like one divided

Through the gap along the hill parallel to the spectators playing into
one anothers hands like men at polo

A wide sweep for the turn at the flags and the sheep wheeled as though
at the word of command dropped through them and travelled rapidly for
the bridge

Steady whispered the crowd

Steady man muttered Parson Leggy

Hold em for Gods sake croaked Kirby huskily Dn I knew it I
saw it coming

The pace down the hill had grown quickertoo quick Close on the bridge
the three sheep made an effort to break A dashand two were checked
but the third went away like the wind and after him Owd Bob a gray
streak against the green

Tammas was cursing silently Kirby was white to the lips and in the
stillness you could plainly hear the Dalesmens sobbing breath as it
fluttered in their throats

Gallop they say hes old and slow muttered the Parson Dash Look
at that For the gray dog racing like the Noreaster over the sea had
already retrieved the fugitive

Man and dog were coaxing the three a step at a time toward the bridge

One venturedthe others followed

In the middle the leader stopped and tried to turnand time was flying
flying and the penning alone must take minutes Many a mans hand was
at his watch but no one could take his eyes off the group below him to
look

Were beat Ive won bet Tammas groaned Saml The two had a
longstanding wager on the matter I allus knoo hoo twould be I
allus told yo th owd tyke

Then breaking into a bellow his honest face crimson with enthusiasm
Coom on Master Good for yo Owd Un Yons the style

For the gray dog had leapt on the back of the hindmost sheep it had
surged forward against the next and they were over and making up the
slope amidst a thunder of applause

At the pen it was a sight to see shepherd and dog working together
The Master his face stern and a little whiter than its wont casting
forward with both hands herding the sheep in the gray dog his eyes
big and bright dropping to hand crawling and creeping closer and
closer

Theyre inNayAydang me Stop er Good Owd Un Ahhh theyre
in And the last sheep reluctantly passed throughon the stroke of
time

A roar went up from the crowd Maggies white face turned pink and
the Dalesmen mopped their wet brows The mob surged forward but the
stewards held them back

Back please Dont encroach MAdams to come

From the far bank the little man watched the scene His coat and cap
were off and his hair gleamed white in the sun his sleeves were rolled
up and his face was twitching but set as he stoodready

The hubbub over the stream at length subsided One of the judges nodded
to him

Noo Wullienoo or niverScots wha hae and they were off

Back gentlemen back Hes offhes coming MAdams coming

They might well shout and push for the great dog was on to his sheep
before they knew it and they went away with a rush with him right on
their backs Up the slope they swept and round the first flag already
galloping Down the hill for the gap and MAdam was flying ahead to
turn them But they passed him like a hurricane and Red Wull was in
front with a rush and turned them alone

MAdam wins Five to four MAdam I lay agin Owd Bob rang out a clear
voice in the silence

Through the gap they rattled ears back feet twinkling like the wings
of driven grouse

Hes lost em Theyll break Theyre away was the cry

Saml was half up the wheel of the Kenmuir wagon every man was on his
toes ladies were standing in their carriages even Jim Masons face
flushed with momentary excitement

The sheep were tearing along the hillside all together like a white
scud After them galloping like a Waterloo winner raced Red Wull And
last of all leaping over the ground like a demoniac making not for the
two flags but the plankbridge the whitehaired figure of MAdam

Hes beat The Killers beat roared a strident voice

MAdam wins Five to four MAdam I lay agin Owd Bob rang out the
clear reply

Red Wull was now racing parallel to the fugitives and above them All
four were travelling at a terrific rate while the two flags were barely
twenty yards in front below the line of flight and almost parallel to
it To effect the turn a change of direction must be made almost through
a right angle

Hes beat hes beat MAdams beat Cant make it nohow was the
roar

From over the stream a yellTurn em Wullie

At the word the great dog swerved down on the flying three They turned
still at the gallop like a troop of cavalry and dropped clean and
neat between the flags and down to the stream they rattled passing
MAdam on the way as though he was standing

Weel done Wullie came the scream from the far bank and from the
crowd went up an involuntary burst of applause

Ma word

Did yo see that

By gob

It was a turn indeed of which the smartest team in the galloping
horsegunners might well have been proud A shade later and they must
have overshot the mark a shade sooner and a miss

Hes not been two minutes so far Were beatendont you think so
Uncle Leggy asked Muriel Sylvester looking up piteously into the
parsons face

Its not what I think my dear its what the judges think the parson
replied and what he thought their verdict would be was plainly writ on
his face for all to read

Right on to the centre of the bridge the leading sheep galloped
andstopped abruptly

Up above in the crowd there was utter silence staring eyes rigid
fingers The sweat was dripping off Long Kirbys face and at the
back a greencoated bookmaker slipped his notebook in his pocket and
glanced behind him James Moore standing in front of them all was the
calmest there

Red Wull was not to be denied Like his forerunner he leapt on the back
of the hindmost sheep But the red dog was heavy where the gray was
light The sheep staggered slipped and fell

Almost before it had touched the water MAdam his face afire and eyes
flaming was in the stream In a second he had hold of the struggling
creature and with an almost superhuman effort had half thrown half
shoved it on to the bank

Again a tribute of admiration led by James Moore

The little man scrambled panting on to the bank and raced after sheep
and dog His face was white beneath the perspiration his breath came in
quavering gasps his trousers were wet and clinging to his legs he was
trembling in every limb and yet indomitable

They were up to the pen and the last wrestle began The crowd silent
and motionless craned forward to watch the uncanny whitehaired little
man and the huge dog working so close below them MAdams face was
white his eyes staring unnaturally bright his bent body projected
forward and he tapped with his stick on the ground like a blind man
coaxing the sheep in And the Tailless Tyke his tongue out and flanks
heaving crept and crawled and worked up to the opening patient as he
had never been before

They were in at last

There was a lukewarm halfhearted cheer then silence

Exhausted and trembling the little man leant against the pen one
hand on it while Red Wull his flanks still heaving gently licked the
other Quite close stood James Moore and the gray dog above was the
black wall of people utterly still below the judges comparing notes
In the silence you could almost hear the panting of the crowd

Then one of the judges went up to James Moore and shook him by the hand

The gray dog had won Owd Bob o Kenmuir had won the Shepherds Trophy
outright

A seconds palpitating silence a womans hysterical laughand
a deepmouthed bellow rent the expectant air shouts screams
hattossings backclappings blending in a din that made the
manywinding waters of the Silver Lea quiver and quiver again

Owd Bob o Kenmuir had won the Shepherds Trophy outright

Maggies face flushed a scarlet hue Wee Anne flung fat arms toward
her triumphant Bob and screamed with the best Squire and parson each
redcheeked were boisterously shaking hands Long Kirby who had not
prayed for thirty years ejaculated with heartfelt earnestness Thank
God Saml Todd bellowed in Tammass ear and almost slew him with his
mighty buffets Among the Dalesmen some laughed like drunken men some
cried like children all joined in that roaring song of victory

To little M Adam standing with his back to the crowd that storm of
cheering came as the first announcement of defeat

A wintry smile like the sun over a March sea crept across his face

We might a kent it Wullie he muttered soft and low The tension
loosed the battle lost the little man almost broke down There were
red dabs of color in his face his eyes were big his lips pitifully
quivering he was near to sobbing

An old manutterly alone he had staked his all on a throwand lost

Lady Eleanour marked the forlorn little figure standing solitary on the
fringe of the uproarious mob She noticed the expression on his face
and her tender heart went out to the lone man in his defeat

She went up to him and laid a hand upon his arm

Mr MAdam she said timidly wont you come and sit down in the
tent You look _so_ tired I can find you a corner where no one shall
disturb you

The little man wrenched roughly away The unexpected kindness coming
at that moment was almost too much for him A few paces off he turned
again

Its reel kind o yer ladyship he said huskily and tottered away to
be alone with Red Wull

     

Meanwhile the victors stood like rocks in the tideway About them surged
a continually changing throng shaking the mans hand patting the dog

Maggie had carried wee Anne to tender her congratulations Long Kirby
had come Tammas Saunderson Hoppin Tupper Londesleyall but Jim
Mason and now elbowing through the press came squire and parson

Well done James well done indeed Knew youd win told you so eh
eh Then facetiously to Owd Bob Knew you would Robert old man
Ought to Robert the Devmusnt be a naughty boyeh eh

The first time ever the Dale Cups been won outright said the Parson
and I daresay it never will again And I think Kenmuirs the very
fittest place for its final home and a Gray Dog of Kenmuir for its
winner

Oh by the by burst in the squire Ive fixed the Manor dinner for
today fortnight James Tell Saunderson and Tupper will you Want all
the tenants there He disappeared into the crowd but in a minute had
fought his way back Id forgotten something he shouted Tell your
Maggie perhaps youll have news for her after it eh eh and he was
gone again

Last of all James Moore was aware of a white blotchy grinning face at
his elbow

I maun congratulate ye Mr Moore Yeve beat usyou and the
gentlemenjudges

Twas a close thing MAdam the other answered An yo made a gran
fight In ma life I niver saw a finer turn than yours by the two flags
yonder I hope yo bear no malice

Malice Me Is it likely Na na Do onto ivery man as he does onto
youand somethin over thats my motter I owe ye mony a good turn
which Ill pay ye yet Na na theres nae good fechtin agin fateand
the judges Weel I wush you well o yer victory Aiblins twill be oor
turn next

Then a rush headed by Saml roughly hustled the one away and bore the
other off on its shoulders in boisterous triumph

     

In giving the Cup away Lady Eleanour made a prettier speech than ever
Yet all the while she was haunted by a white miserable face and all
the while she was conscious of two black moving dots in the Murk Muir
Pass opposite hersolitary desolate a contrast to the huzzaing crowd
around

     

That is how the champion challenge Dale Cup the worldknown Shepherds
Trophy came to wander no more won outright by the last of the Gray
Dogs of KenmuirOwd Bob

Why he was the last of the Gray Dogs is now to be told




PART VI THE BLACK KILLER




Chapter XXVI REDHANDED


THE SUN was hiding behind the Pike Over the lowlands the feathery
breath of night hovered still And the hillside was shivering in the
chillness of dawn

Down on the silvery sward beside the Stony Bottom there lay the ruffled
body of a dead sheep All about the victim the dewy ground was dark and
patchy like dishevelled velvet bracken trampled down stones
displaced as though by straggling feet and the whole spotted with the
allpervading red

A score yards up the hill in a writhing confusion of red and gray two
dogs at deathgrips While yet higher a pack of wildeyed hillsheep
watched fascinated the bloody drama

The fight raged Red and gray bloodspattered murderouseyed the
crimson froth dripping from their jaws now rearing high with arching
crests and wrestling paws now rolling over in tumbling tossing
worrying disorderthe two fought out their bloodfeud

Above the closepacked flock huddled and stamped ever edging nearer
to watch the issue Just so must the women of Rome have craned round the
arenas to see two men striving in deathstruggle

The first cold flicker of dawn stole across the green The red eye of
the morning peered aghast over the shoulder of the Pike And from the
sleeping dale there arose the yodling of a man driving his cattle home

Day was upon them

     

James Moore was waked by a little whimpering cry beneath his window
He leapt out of bed and rushed to look for well he knew twas not for
nothing that the old dog was calling

Lord o mercy whativers come to yo Owd Un he cried in anguish
And indeed his favorite wardaubed almost past recognition presented
a pitiful spectacle

In a moment the Master was downstairs and out examining him

Poor old lad yo have caught it this time he cried There was a
ragged tear on the dogs cheek a deep gash in his throat from which the
blood still welled staining the white escutcheon on his chest while
head and neck were clotted with the red

Hastily the Master summoned Maggie After her Andrew came hurrying
down And a little later a tiny nightclad nakedfooted figure
appeared in the door wideeyed and then fled screaming

They doctored the old warrior on the table in the kitchen Maggie
tenderly washed his wounds and dressed them with gentle pitying
fingers and he stood all the while grateful yet fidgeting looking up
into his masters face as if imploring to be gone

He mun a had a rare tussle wi some oneeh dad said the girl as
she worked

Ay and wi whom Twasnt for nowt he got fightin I warnt Nay
hes a tale to tell has The Owd Un andA hhh I thowt as much Look
ee For bathing the bloody jaws he had come upon a cluster of tawny
red hair hiding in the corners of the lips

The secret was out Those few hairs told their own accusing tale To but
one creature in the Daleland could they belongTh Tailless Tyke

He mun a bin trespassin cried Andrew

Ay and up to some o his bloody work Ill lay my life the Master
answered But Th Owd Un shall show us

The old dogs hurts proved less severe than had at first seemed
possible His good gray coat forestthick about his throat had never
served him in such good stead And at length the wounds washed and sewn
up he jumped down all in a hurry from the table and made for the door

Noo owd lad yo may show us said the Master and with Andrew
hurried after him down the hill along the stream and over Langholm
How And as they neared the Stony Bottom the sheep herding in groups
raised frightened heads to stare

Of a sudden a cloud of poisonous flies rose buzzing up before them
and there in a dimple of the ground lay a murdered sheep Deserted by
its comrades the glazed eyes staring helplessly upward the throat
horribly worried it slept its last sleep

The matter was plain to see At last the Black Killer had visited
Kenmuir

I guessed as much said the Master standing over the mangled body
Well its the worst nights work ever the Killer done I reckn Th
Owd Un come on him while he was at it and then they fought And ma
word it munn ha bin a fight too For all around were traces of that
terrible struggle the earth torn up and tossed bracken uprooted and
throughout little dabs of wool and tufts of tawny hair mingling with
darkstained irongray wisps

James Moore walked slowly over the battlefield stooping down as though
he were gleaning And gleaning he was

A long time he bent so and at length raised himself

The Killer has killed his last he muttered Red Wull has run his
course Then turning to Andrew Run yo home lad and fetch the men
to carry yon away pointing to the carcass And Bob lad yo ye done
your work for today and right well too go yo home wi him Im off
to see to this

He turned and crossed the Stony Bottom His face was set like a rock
At length the proof was in his hand Once and for all the hillcountry
should be rid of its scourge

As he stalked up the hill a dark head appeared at his knee Two big
grey eyes half doubting half penitent wholly wistful looked up at
him and a silvery brush signalled a mute request

Eh Owd Un but yo should ha gone wi Andrew the Master said
Hooiver as yo are here come along And he strode away up the hill
gaunt and menacing with the gray dog at his heels

As they approached the house MAdam was standing in the door sucking
his eternal twig James Moore eyed him closely as he came but the sour
face framed in the door betrayed nothing Sarcasm surprise challenge
were all writ there plain to read but no guilty consciousness of the
others errand no storm of passion to hide a failing heart If it was
acting it was splendidly done

As man and dog passed through the gap in the hedge the expression on
the little mans face changed again He started forward

James Moore as I live he cried and advanced with both hands
extended as though welcoming a longlost brother Deed and its a
weary while sin yeve honored ma puir hoose And in fact it was nigh
twenty years I tak it gey kind in ye to look in on a lonely auld man
Come ben and lets ha a crack James Moore kens weel hoo welcome he aye
is in ma bit biggin

The Master ignored the greeting

One o ma sheep been killed back o t Dyke he announced shortly
jerking his thumb over his shoulder

The Killer

The Killer

The cordiality beaming in every wrinkle of the little mans face was
absorbed in a wondering interest and that again gave place to sorrowful
sympathy

Dear dear its come to that has itat last he said gently and
his eyes wandered to the gray dog and dwelt mournfully upon him Man
Im sorryI canna tell ye Im surprised Masel I kent it all alang
But gin Adam MAdam had tellt ye no ha believed him Weel weel hes
lived his life gin ony dog iver did and noo he maun gang where
hes sent a many before him Puir mon puir tyke He heaved a sigh
profoundly melancholy tenderly sympathetic Then brightening up a
little Yell ha come for the gun

James Moore listened to this harangue at first puzzled Then he caught
the others meaning and his eyes flashed

Ye fool MAdam did ye hear iver tell o a sheepdog worryin his
masters sheep

The little man was smiling and suave again now rubbing his hands softly
together

Yere right I never did But your dog is not as ither dogsTheres
none like himnone Ive heard ye say so yersel mony a time An Im
wi ye Theres none like himfor devilment His voice began to quiver
and his face to blaze Its his cursed cunning thats deceived ivery
one but mewhelp o Satan that he is He shouldered up to his tall
adversary If not him wha else had done it he asked looking up
into the others face as if daring him to speak

The Masters shaggy eyebrows lowered He towered above the other like
the Muir Pike above its surrounding hills

Wha ye ask he replied coldly and I answer you Your Red Wull
MAdam your Red Wull Its your Wulls the Black Killer Its your
Wulls bin the plague o the land these months past Its your Wulls
killed ma sheep back oyon

At that all the little mans affected goodhumor fled

Ye lee mon ye lee he cried in a dreadful scream dancing up to his
antagonist I knoo hoo twad be I said so I see what yere at Yeve
found at lastblind that yeve beenthat its yer ain hells tyke
thats the Killer and noo ye think by yer leein impitations to throw
the blame on ma Wullie Ye rob me o ma Cup ye rob me o ma son ye
wrang me in ilka thing theres but ae thing left meWullie And noo
yere set on takin him awa But ye shall notIll kill ye first

He was all ashake bobbing up and down like a stopper in a sodawater
bottle and almost sobbing

Ha ye no wranged me enough wi oo that Ye langleggit liar wi yer
skulkin murderin tyke he cried Ye say its Wullie Wheres yer
proofand he snapped his fingers in the others face

The Master was now as calm as his foe was passionate Where he
replied sternly why there holding out his right hand Yons proof
enough to hang a hunnerd For lying in his broad palm was a little
bundle of that damning red hair

Where

There

Lets see it The little man bent to look closer

Theres for yer proof he cried and spat deliberately down into the
others naked palm Then he stood back facing his enemy in a manner to
have done credit to a nobler deed

James Moore strode forward It looked as if he was about to make an end
of his miserable adversary so strongly was he moved His chest heaved
and the blue eyes blazed But just as one had thought to see him
take his foe in the hollow of his hand and crush him who should come
stalking round the corner of the house but the Tailless Tyke

A droll spectacle he made laughable even at that moment He limped
sorely his head and neck were swathed in bandages and beneath their
ragged fringe the little eyes gleamed out fiery and bloodshot

Round the corner he came unaware of strangers then straightway
recognizing his visitors halted abruptly His hackles ran up each
individual hair stood on end till his whole body resembled a newshorn
wheatfield and a snarl like a rusty brake shoved hard down escaped
from between his teeth Then he trotted heavily forward his head
sinking low and lower as he came

And Owd Bob eager to take up the gage of battle advanced glad and
gallant to meet him Daintily he picked his way across the yard head
and tail erect perfectly selfcontained Only the long gray hair
about his neck stood up like the ruff of a lady of the court of Queen
Elizabeth

But the warworn warriors were not to be allowed their will

Wullie Wullie wad ye cried the little man

Bob lad coom in called the other Then he turned and looked down at
the man beside him contempt flaunting in every feature

Well he said shortly

MAdams hands were opening and shutting his face was quite white
beneath the tan but he spoke calmly

Ill tell ye the whole story and its the truth he said slowly I
was up there the mornpointing to the window aboveand I see Wullie
crouchin down alangside the Stony Bottom Ye ken he has the run o
ma land o neets the same as your dog In a minnit I see anither dog
squatterin alang on your side the Bottom He creeps up to the sheep on
th hillside chases em and doons one The sun was risen by then and
I see the dog clear as I see you noo It was that dog thereI swear
it His voice rose as he spoke and he pointed an accusing finger at
Owd Bob

Noo Wullie thinks I And afore ye could clap yer hands Wullie was
over the Bottom and on to him as he gorgedthe bloodyminded murderer
They fought and foughtI could hear the roarin at where I stood I
watched till I could watch nae langer and all in a sweat I rin doon
the stairs and oot When I got there there was yer tyke makin fu
split for Kenmuir and Wullie comin up the hill to me Its Gods
truth Im tellin ye Tak him hame James Moore and let his dinner be
an ounce o lead Twill be the best days work iver ye done

The little man must be lyinglying palpably Yet he spoke with
an earnestness a seeming belief in his own story that might have
convinced one who knew him less well But the Master only looked down on
him with a great scorn

Its Monday today he said coldly I gie yo till Saturday If yove
not done your duty by thenand well you know what tisI shall come
do it for ye Ony gate I shall come and see Ill remind ye agin o
Thursdayyoll be at the Manor dinner I suppose Noo Ive warned yo
and you know best whether Im in earnest or no Bob lad

He turned away but turned again

Im sorry for ye but Ive ma duty to dosove you Till Saturday I
shall breathe no word to ony soul o this business so that if you see
good to put him oot o the way wioot bother no one need iver know as
hoo Adam MAdams Red Wull was the Black Killer

He turned away for the second time But the little man sprang after him
and clutched him by the arm

Look ye here James Moore he cried in thick shaky horrible voice
Yere big Im sma yere strang Im weak yeve ivery one to your
back Ive niver a one you tell your story and theyll believe yefor
you gae to church Ill tell mine and theyll think I liefor I dinna
But a word in your ear If iver agin I catch ye on ma land byhe
swore a great oathIll no spare ye You ken best if Im in earnest or
no And his face was dreadful to see in its hideous determinedness




Chapter XXVII FOR THE DEFENCE


THAT night a vague story was whispered In the Sylvester Arms But
Tammas on being interrogated pursed his lips and said Nay Im sworn
to say nowt Which was the old mans way of putting that he knew nowt

     

On Thursday morning James Moore and Andrew came down arrayed in all
their best It was the day of the squires annual dinner to his tenants

The two however were not allowed to start upon their way until they
had undergone a critical inspection by Maggie for the girl liked her
mankind to do honor to Kenmuir on these occasions So she brushed
up Andrew tied his scarf saw his boots and hands were clean and
titivated him generally till she had converted the ungainly hobbledehoy
into a thoroughly likely young mon

And all the while she was thinking of that other boy for whom on such
gala days she had been wont to perform like offices And her father
marking the tears in her eyes and mindful of the squires mysterious
hint said gently

Cheer up lass Happen Ill ha news for you the night

The girl nodded and smiled wanly

Happen so dad she said But in her heart she doubted

Nevertheless it was with a cheerful countenance that a little later
she stood in the door with wee Anne and Owd Bob and waved the travellers
Godspeed while the goldenhaired lassie fiercely gripping the old
dogs tail with one hand and her sister with the other screamed them a
wordless farewell

     

The sun had reached its highest when the two wayfarers passed through
the gray portals of the Manor

In the stately entrance hall imposing with all the evidences of a long
and honorable line were gathered now the many tenants throughout the
wide March Mere Estate Weatherbeaten rentpaying sons of the soil
most of them nativeborn many of them like James Moore whose fathers
had for generations owned and farmed the land they now leased at the
hands of the Sylvestersthere in the old hall they were assembled
a mighty host And apart from the others standing as though in irony
beneath the frown of one of those steelclad warriors who held the door
was little MAdam puny always paltry now mocking his manhood

The door at the far end of the hall opened and the squire entered
beaming on every one

Here you areeh eh How are you all Glad to see ye Goodday James
Goodday Saunderson Goodday to you all Bringin a friend with me eh
eh and he stood aside to let by his agent Parson Leggy and last of
all shy and blushing a fairhaired young giant

If it baint David was the cry Eh lad wes fain to see yo And
yom lookin stout surely And they thronged about the boy shaking
him by the hand and asking him his story

Twas but a simple tale After his flight on the eventful night he had
gone south drovering He had written to Maggie and been surprised and
hurt to receive no reply In vain he had waited and too proud to write
again had remained ignorant of his fathers recovery neither caring
nor daring to return Then by mere chance he had met the squire at the
York cattleshow and that kind man who knew his story had eased his
fears and obtained from him a promise to return as soon as the term of
his engagement had expired And there he was

The Dalesmen gathered round the boy listening to his tale and in
return telling him the home news and chaffing him about Maggie

Of all the people present only one seemed unmoved and that was MAdam
When first David had entered he had started forward a flush of color
warming his thin cheeks but no one had noticed his emotion and now
back again beneath his armor he watched the scene a sour smile playing
about his lips

I think the lad might ha the grace to come and say hes sorry for
temptin to murder me Hooiverwith a characteristic shrugI
suppose Im onraisonable

Then the gong rang out its summons and the squire led the way into the
great dininghall At the one end of the long table heavy with all the
solid delicacies of such a feast he took his seat with the Master of
Kenmuir upon his right At the other end was Parson Leggy While down
the sides the stalwart Dalesmen were arrayed with MAdam a little lost
figure in the centre

At first they talked but little awed like children knives plied
glasses tinkled the carvers had all their work only the tongues were
at rest But the squires ringing laugh and the parsons cheery tones
soon put them at their ease and a babel of voices rose and waxed

Of them all only MAdam sat silent He talked to no man and you may
be sure no one talked to him His hand crept oftener to his glass than
plate till the sallow face began to flush and the dim eyes to grow
unnaturally bright

Toward the end of the meal there was loud tapping on the table calls
for silence and men pushed back their chairs The squire was on his
feet to make his annual speech

He started by telling them how glad he was to see them there He made
an allusion to Owd Bob and the Shepherds Trophy which was heartily
applauded He touched on the Black Killer and said he had a remedy
to propose that Th Owd Un should be set upon the criminals tracka
suggestion which was received with enthusiasm while MAdams cackling
laugh could be heard high above the rest

From that he dwelt upon the existing condition of agriculture the
depression in which he attributed to the late Radical Government He
said that now with the Conservatives in office and a ministry composed
of honorable men and gentlemen he felt convinced that things would
brighten The Radicals one ambition was to set class against class
landlord against tenant Well during the last five hundred years the
Sylvesters had rarely beenhe was sorry to have to confess itgood men
laughter and dissent but he never yet heard of the Sylvesterthough
he shouldnt say itwho was a bad landlord loud applause

This was a free country and any tenant of his who was not content a
voice Oo says we baintthank you thank youwell there was
room for him outside Cheers He thanked God from the bottom of his
heart that during the forty years he had been responsible for the
March Mere Estate there had never been any friction between him and his
people cheers and he didnt think there ever would be Loud cheers

Thank you thank you And his motto was Shun a Radical as you do the
deviland he was very glad to see them all therevery glad and he
wished to give them a toast The Queen God bless her andwait a
minutewith her Majestys name to couplehe was sure that gracious
lady would wish itthat of Owd Bob o Kenmuir Then he sat down
abruptly amid thundering applause

The toasts duly honoured James Moore by prescriptive right as Master
of Kenmuir rose to answer

He began by saying that he spoke as representing all the tenantsbut
he was interrupted

Na came a shrill voice from halfway down the table Yell except me
James Moore Id as lief be represented by Judas

There were cries of Hold ye gab little mon and the squires voice
Thatll do Mr MAdam

The little man restrained his tongue but his eyes gleamed like a
ferrets and the Master continued his speech

He spoke briefly and to the point in short phrases And all the while
MAdam kept up a lowvoiced running commentary At length he could
control himself no longer Half rising from his chair he leant forward
with hot face and burning eyes and cried Sit doon James Moore Hoo
daur ye stan there like an honest man ye whitewashed sepulchre Sit
doon I say orthreateninglywad ye hae me come to ye

At that the Dalesmen laughed uproariously and even the Masters grim
face relaxed But the squires voice rang out sharp and stern

Keep silence and sit down Mr MAdam Dyou hear me sir If I have to
speak to you again it will be to order you to leave the room

The little man obeyed sullen and vengeful like a beaten cat

The Master concluded his speech by calling on all present to give three
cheers for the squire her ladyship and the young ladies

The call was responded to enthusiastically every man standing Just as
the noise was at its zenith Lady Eleanour herself with her two fair
daughters glided into the gallery at the end of the hall whereat the
cheering became deafening

Slowly the clamor subsided One by one the tenants sat down At length
there was left standing only one solitary figureM Adam

His face was set and he gripped the chair in front of him with thin
nervous hands

Mr Sylvester he began in low yet clear voice ye said this is a
free country and were a free men And that bein so Ill tak the
liberty wi yer permission to say a word Its maybe the last time
Ill be wi ye so I hope yell listen to me

The Dalesmen looked surprised and the squire uneasy Nevertheless he
nodded assent

The little man straightened himself His face was tense as though
strung up to a high resolve All the passion had fled from it all
the bitterness was gone and left behind was a strange enobling
earnestness Standing there in the silence of that great hall with
every eye upon him he looked like some prisoner at the bar about to
plead for his life

Gentlemen he began Ive bin amang ye noo a score years and I can
truly say theres not a man in this room I can ca Friend He looked
along the ranks of upturned faces Ay David I see ye and you Mr
Hornbut and you Mr Sylvesterilka one o you and not one asd back
me like a comrade gin a trouble came upon me There was no rebuke in
the grave little voiceit merely stated a hard fact

Theres I doot no one amang ye but has some onefriend or bloodwham
he can turn to when things are sair wi him Ive no one

I bear alane my lade o carealane wi Wullie who stands to me
blaw or snaw rain or shine And whiles Im feared hell be took from
me He spoke this last half to himself a grieved puzzled expression
on his face as though lately he had dreamed some ill dream

Forbye Wuilie Ive no friend on Gods earth And mind ye a bad man
aften maks a good friendbut yeve never given me the chance Its a
sair thing that gentlemen to ha to fight the battle o life alane no

voice shook and the dim eyes puckered and filled

Sin Ive bin amang yetwentyodd yearscan any man here mind
speakin any word that wasna ill to me He paused there was no reply

Ill tell ye All the time Ive lived here Ive had one kindly word
spoke to me and that a fortnight gone and not by a man thenby her

no one visible there but a curtain at one end shook as though it were
sobbing

Weel Im thinkin well be gaein in a wee while noo Wullie and me
alane and thegither as weve aye done And its time we went Yeve had

The gentle condemning voice ceased and began again

Chapter XXVIII THE DEVILS BOWL


HE sat down In the great hall there was silence save for a tiny sound
from the gallery like a sob suppressed

The squire rose hurriedly and left the room After him one by one
trailed the tenants At length two only remainedMAdam sitting
solitary with a long array of empty chairs on either hand and at the
far end of the table Parson Leggy stern upright motionless

When the last man had left the room the parson rose and with lips
tightset strode across the silent hall

MAdam he said rapidly and almost roughly Ive listened to
what youve said as I think we all have with a sore heart You hit
hardbut I think you were right And if Ive not done my duty by you as
I oughtand I fear Ive notits now my duty as Gods minister to be
the first to say Im sorry And it was evident from his face what an
effort the words cost him

The little man tilted back his chair and raised his head

It was the old MAdam who looked up The thin lips were curled a grin
was crawling across the mocking face and he wagged his head gently as
he looked at the speaker through the slits of his halfclosed eyes

Mr Hornbut I believe ye thocht me in earnest deed and I do He
leaned back in his chair and laughed softly Ye swallered it all
down like best butter Dear dear to think o that Then stretching
forward

Mr Hornbut I was playin wi ye

The parsons face as he listened was ugly to watch He shot out a hand
and grabbed the scoffer by his coat then dropped it again and turned
abruptly away

As he passed through the door a little sneering voice called after him

Mr Hornbut I ask ye hoo you a minister o the Church of England
can reconcile it to yer conscience to thinkthough it be but for a
minutethat there can be ony good in a man and him no churchgoer Sir
yere a hereticnot to say a heathen He sniggered to himself and his
hand crept to a halfemptied wine decanter

     

An hour later James Moore his business with the squire completed
passed through the hall on his way out Its only occupant was now
MAdam and the Master walked straight up to his enemy

MAdam he said gruffly holding out a sinewy hand Id like to
say

The little man knocked aside the token of friendship

Na na No cant if ye please James Moore Thatll aiblins go doon
wi the parsons but not wi me I ken you and you ken me and all the
whitewash i th warldll no deceive us

The Master turned away and his face was hard as the nether millstone
But the little man pursued him

I was nigh forgettin he said Ive a surprise for ye James Moore
But I hear its yer birthday on Sunday and Ill keep it till thenhe
he

Yell see me before Sunday MAdam the other answered On Saturday
as I told yo Im comin to see if yove done yer duty

Whether ye come James Moore is your business Whether yell iver go
once there Ill mak mine Ive warned ye twice noo and the little
man laughed that harsh cackling laugh of his

At the door of the hall the Master met David Noo lad yore comin
along wi Andrew and me he said Maggiell niver forgie us if we
dinna bring yo home wi us

Thank you kindly Mr Moore the boy replied Ive to see squire
first and then yo may be sure Ill be after you

The Master faltered a moment

David han yo spoke to yer father yet he asked in low voice Yo
should lad

The boy made a gesture of dissent

I canna he said petulantly

I would lad the other advised An yo dont yo may be sorry
after

As he turned away he heard the boys steps dull and sodden as he
crossed the hall and then a thin wouldbe cordial voice in the
emptiness

I declar if tisna David The return o the Prodeegalhe he So
yeve seen yer auld dad at last and the last the proper place say
ye for yen fatherhe he Eh lad but Im blithe to see ye Dye mind
when we was last thegither Ye was kneelin on ma chest Your times

if twas yesterday Weel weel well say nae mair about it Boys will
be boys Sons will be sons Accidents will happen And if at first ye
dont succeed why try try againhe he

     

Dusk was merging into darkness when the Master and Andrew reached the
Dalesmans Daughter It had been long dark when they emerged from the
cosy parlor of the inn and plunged out into the night

As they crossed the Silver Lea and trudged over that familiar ground
where a fortnight since had been fought out the battle of the Cup the
wind fluttered past them in spasmodic gasps

There s trouble in the wind said the Master

Ay answered his laconic son

All day there had been no breath of air and the sky dangerously blue
But now a world of black was surging up from the horizon smothering the
starlit night and small dark clouds like puffs of smoke detaching
themselves from the main body were driving tempestuously forwardthe
vanguard of the storm

In the distance was a low rumbling like heavy tumbrils on the floor of
heaven All about the wind sounded hollow like a mighty scythe on corn
The air was oppressed with a leaden blacknessno glimmer of light on
any hand and as they began the ascent of the Pass they reached out
blind hands to feel along the rockface

A seafret cool and wetting fell A few big raindrops splashed
heavily down The wind rose with a leap and roared past them up the
rocky track And the watergates of heaven were flung wide

Wet and weary they battled on thinking sometimes of the cosy parlor
behind sometimes of the home in front wondering whether Maggie in
flat contradiction of her fathers orders would be up to welcome them
or whether only Owd Bob would come out to meet them

The wind volleyed past them like salvoes of artillery The rain stormed
at them from above spat at them from the rockface and leapt up at
them from their feet

Once they halted for a moment finding a miserable shelter in a crevice
of the rock

Its a Black Killers night panted the Master I reckn hes oot

Ay the boy gasped reckn he is Up and up they climbed through the
blackness blind and buffeted The eternal thunder of the rain was all
about them the clamor of the gale above and far beneath the roar of
angry waters

Once in a lull in the storm the Master turned and looked back into the
blackness along the path they had come

Did ye hear onythin he roared above the muffled soughing of the
wind

Nay Andrew shouted back

I thowt I heard a step the Master cried peering down But nothing
could he see

Then the wind leaped to life again like a giant from his sleep drowning
all sound with its hurricane voice and they turned and bent to their
task again

Nearing the summit the Master turned once more

There it was again he called but his words were swept away on the
storm and they buckled to the struggle afresh

Ever and anon the moon gleamed down through the riot of tossing sky
Then they could see the wet wall above them with the water tumbling
down its sheer face and far below in the roaring gutter of the Pass a
brownstained torrent Hardly however had they time to glance around
when a mass of cloud would hurry jealously up and all again was
blackness and noise

At length nigh spent they topped the last and steepest pitch of the
Pass and emerged into the Devils Bowl There overcome with their
exertions they flung themselves on to the soaking ground to draw
breath

Behind them the wind rushed with a sullen roar up the funnel of the
Pass It screamed above them as though ten million devils were ahorse
and blurted out on to the wild Marches beyond

As they lay there still panting the moon gleamed down in momentary
graciousness In front through the lashing rain they could discern the
hillocks that squat haglike round the Devils Bowl and lying in its
bosom its white waters usually so still ploughed now into a thousand
furrows the Lone Tarn

The Master raised his head and craned forward at the ghostly scene Of
a sudden he reared himself on to his arms and stayed motionless awhile
Then he dropped as though dead forcing down Andrew with an iron hand

Lad didst see he whispered

Nay what wast the boy replied roused by his fathers tone

There

But as the Master pointed forward a blur of cloud intervened and all
was dark Quickly it passed and again the lantern of the night shone
down And Andrew looking with all his eyes saw indeed

There in front by the fretting waters of the Tarn packed in a solid
phalanx with every head turned in the same direction was a flock of
sheep They were motionless allintent staring with horrorbulging
eyes A column of steam rose from their bodies into the rainpierced
air Panting and palpitating yet they stood with their backs to the
water as though determined to sell their lives dearly Beyond them
not fifty yards away crouched a humpbacked boulder casting a long
misshapen shadow in the moonlight And beneath it were two black
objects one still struggling feebly

The Killer gasped the boy and all ablaze with excitement began
forging forward

Steady lad steady urged his father dropping a restraining hand on
the boys shoulder

Above them a huddle of clouds flung in furious rout across the night
and the moon was veiled

Follow lad ordered the Master and began to crawl silently forward
As stealthily Andrew pursued And over the sodden ground they crept one
behind the other like two nighthawks on some foul errand

On they crawled lying prone during the blinks of moon stealing forward
in the dark till at length the swish of the rain on the waters of the
Tarn and the sobbing of the flock in front warned them they were near

They skirted the trembling pack passing so close as to brush against
the flanking sheep and yet unnoticed for the sheep were soulabsorbed
in the tragedy in front Only when the moon was in Andrew could hear
them huddling and stamping in the darkness And again as it shone out
fearfully they edged closer to watch the bloody play

Along the Tarn edge the two crept And still the gracious moon hid their
approach and the drunken wind drowned with its revelry the sound of
their coming

So they stole on on hands and knees with hearts aghast and fluttering
breath until of a sudden in a lull of wind they could hear right
before them the smack and slobber of bloody lips chewing their bloody
meal

Say thy prayers Red Wull Thy last minutes come muttered the
Master rising to his knees Then in Andrews ear When I rush lad
follow For he thought when the moon rose to jump in on the great
dog and surprising him as he lay gorged and unsuspicious to deal him
one terrible swashing blow and end forever the lawless doings of the
Tailless Tyke

The moon flung off its veil of cloud White and cold it stared down
into the Devils Bowl on murderer and murdered

Within a hands cast of the avengers of blood humped the black boulder
On the border of its shadow lay a dead sheep and standing beside the
body his coat all ruffled by the hand of the stormOwd BobOwd Bob o
Kenmuir

Then the light went in and darkness covered the land




Chapter XXIX THE DEVILS BOWL


IT was Owd Bob There could be no mistaking In the wide world there
was but one Owd Bob o Kenmuir The silver moon gleamed down on the dark
head and rough gray coat and lit the white escutcheon on his chest

And in the darkness James Moore was lying with his face pressed downward
that he might not see

Once he raised himself on his arms his eyes were shut and face
uplifted like a blind man praying He passed a weary hand across his
brow his head dropped again and he moaned and moaned like a man in
everlasting pain

Then the darkness lifted a moment and he stole a furtive glance like a
murderers at the gallowstree at the scene in front

It was no dream clear and cruel in the moonlight the humpbacked
boulder the dead sheep and that gray figure beautiful motionless
damned for all eternity

The Master turned his face and looked at Andrew a dumb pitiful
entreaty in his eyes but in the boys white horrorstricken
countenance was no comfort Then his head lolled down again and the
strong man was whimpering

He he he Scuse ma laffin Mr Moorehe he he

A little man all wet and shrunk sat hunching on a mound above them
rocking his shrivelled form to and fro in the agony of his merriment

Ye raskilhe he Ye roguehe he and he shook his fist waggishly
at the unconscious gray dog I owe ye anither grudge for thisyeve
anteecipated meand he leant back and shook this way and that in
convulsive mirth

The man below him rose heavily to his feet and tumbled toward the
mocker his great figure swaying from side to side as though in blind
delirium moaning still as he went And there was that on his face which
no man can mistake Boy that he was Andrew knew it

Feyther feyther doee not he pleaded running after his father and
laying impotent hands on him

But the strong man shook him off like a fly and rolled on swaying and
groaning with that awful expression plain to see in the moonlight

In front the little man squatted in the rain bowed double still and
took no thought to flee

Come on James Moore Come on he laughed malignant joy in his voice
and something gleamed bright in his right hand and was hid again Ive
bin waitin this a weary while noo Come on

Then had there been done something worse than sheepmurder in the
dreadful lonesomeness of the Devils Bowl upon that night but of
a sudden there sounded the splash of a mans foot falling heavily
behind a hand like a falling tree smote the Master on the shoulder and
a voice roared above the noise of the storm

Mr Moore Look man look

The Master tried to shake off that detaining grasp but it pinned him
where he was immovable

Look I tell yo cried that great voice again

A hand pushed past him and pointed and sullenly he turned ignoring the
figure at his side and looked

The wind had dropped suddenly as it had risen the little man on the
mound had ceased to chuckle Andrews sobs were hushed and in the
background the huddled flock edged closer The world hung balanced on
the pinpoint of the moment Every eye was in the one direction

With dull uncomprehending gaze James Moore stared as bidden There was
the gray dog naked in the moonlight heedless still of any witnesses
there the murdered sheep lying within and without that distorted shade
and there the humpbacked boulder

He stared into the shadow and still stared

Then he started as though struck The shadow of the boulder had moved

Motionless with head shot forward and bulging eyes he gazed

Ay ay ay he was sure of ita huge dim outline as of a lion
_couchant_ in the very thickest of the blackness

At that he was seized with such a palsy of trembling that he must have
fallen but for the strong arm about his waist

Clearer every moment grew that crouching figure till at length they
plainly could discern the line of arching loins the crest thick as a
stallions the massive wagging head No mistake this time There he
lay in the deepest black gigantic revelling in his horrid debauchthe
Black Killer

And they watched him at his feast Now he burrowed into the spongy
flesh now turned to lap the dark pool which glittered in the moonlight
at his side like claret in a silver cup Now lifting his head he
snapped irritably at the raindrops and the moon caught his wicked
rolling eye and the red shreds of flesh dripping from his jaw And
again raising his great muzzle as if about to howl he let the
delicious nectar trickle down his throat and ravish his palate

So he went on all unsuspicious wisely nodding in slowmouthed
gluttony And in the stillness between the claps of wind they could
hear the smacking of his lips

While all the time the gray dog stood before him motionless as though
carved in stone

At last as the murderer rolled his great head from side to side he saw
that still figure At the sight he leaped back dismayed Then with a
deepmouthed roar that shook the waters of the Tarn he was up and across
his victim with fangs bared his coat standing erect in wet rigid
furrows from topknot to tail

So the two stood face to face with perhaps a yard of rainpierced air
between them

The wind hushed its sighing to listen The moon stared down white
and dumb Away at the back the sheep edged closer While save for the
everlasting thunder of the rain there was utter stillness

An age it seemed they waited so Then a voice clear yet low and far
away like a bugle in a distant city broke the silence

Eh Wullie it said

There was no anger in the tones only an incomparable reproach the
sound of the cracking of a mans heart

At the call the great dog leapt round snarling in hideous passion He
saw the small familiar figure clearcut against the tumbling sky and
for the only time in his life Red Wull was afraid

His bloodfoe was forgotten the dead sheep was forgotten everything
was sunk in the agony of that moment He cowered upon the ground and
a cry like that of a lost soul was wrung from him it rose on the still
night air and floated wailing away and the white waters of the Tarn
thrilled in cold pity out of the lonely hollow over the desolate
Marches into the night

On the mound above stood his master The little mans white hair was
bared to the night wind the rain trickled down his face and his hands
were folded behind his back He stood there looking down into the dell
below him as a man may stand at the tomb of his lately buried wife And
there was such an expression on his face as I cannot describe

Wullie Wullie to me he cried at length and his voice sounded weak
and far like a distant memory

At that the huge brute came crawling toward him on his belly
whimpering as he came very pitiful in his distress He knew his fate as
every sheepdog knows it That troubled him not His pain insufferable
was that this his friend and father who had trusted him should have
found him in his sin

So he crept up to his masters feet and the little man never moved

Wulliema Wullie he said very gently Theyve aye bin agin meand
noo you A mans mithera mans wifea mans dog theyre all Ive
iver had and noo ain o they three has turned agin me Indeed I am
alone

At that the great dog raised himself and placing his forepaws on his
masters chest tenderly lest he should hurt him who was already hurt
past healing stood towering above him while the little man laid his
two colds hands on the dogs shoulders

So they stood looking at one another like a man and his love

     

At MAdams word Owd Bob looked up and for the first time saw his
master

He seemed in nowise startled but trotted over to him There was nothing
fearful in his carriage no haunting bloodguiltiness in the true gray
eyes which never told a lie which never doglike failed to look you
in the face Yet his tail was low and as he stopped at his masters
feet he was quivering For he too knew and was not unmoved

For weeks he had tracked the Killer for weeks he had followed him as he
crossed Kenmuir bound on his bloody errands yet always had lost him on
the Marches Now at last he had run him to ground Yet his heart went
out to his enemy in his distress

I thowt thad been yo lad the Master whispered his hand on the
dark head at his kneeI thowt thad bin yo

     

Rooted to the ground the three watched the scene between MAdam and his
Wull

In the end the Master was whimpering Andrew crying and David turned
his back

At length silent they moved away

Had Ishould I go to him asked David hoarsely nodding toward his
father

Nay nay lad the Master replied Yons not a matter for a mons
friends

So they marched out of the Devils Bowl and left those two alone
together

     

A little later as they trampled along James Moore heard little
pattering staggering footsteps behind

He stopped and the other two went on

Man a voice whispered and a face white and pitiful like a mothers
pleading for her child looked into hisMan yell no tell them a Id
no like em to ken twas ma Wullie Think an t had bin yer ain dog

You may trust me the other answered thickly

The little man stretched out a palsied hand

Gie us yer hand ont And GGod bless ye James Moore

So these two shook hands in the moonlight with none to witness it but
the God who made them

And that is why the mystery of the Black Killer is yet unsolved in
the Daleland Many have surmised besides those three only one other
knowsknows now which of those two he saw upon a summer night was the
guilty which the innocent And Postie Jim tells no man





Chapter XXX THE TAILLESS TYKE AT BAY


ON the following morning there was a sheepauction at the Dalesmans
Daughter

Early as many of the farmers arrived there was one earlier Tupper the
first man to enter the sandfloored parlor found MAdam before him

He was sitting a little forward in his chair his thin hands rested on
his knees and on his face was a gentle dreamy expression such as no
man had ever seen there before All the harsh wrinkles seemed to have
fled in the night and the sour face stamped deep with the bitterness
of life was softened now as if at length at peace

When I coom doon this mornin said Teddy Bolstock in a whisper I
found im sittin just so And hes nor moved nor spoke since

Wheres th Terror then asked Tupper awed somehow into like hushed
tones

In t paddock at back Teddy answered marchin hoop and doon hoop
and doon for a the world like a sentrysoger And so he was when I
looked oot o window when I wake

Then Londesley entered and after him Ned Hoppin Rob Saunderson Jim
Mason and others each with his dog And each man as he came in and
saw the little lone figure for once without its huge attendant genius
put the same question while the dogs sniffed about the little man as
though suspecting treachery And all the time MAdam sat as though
he neither heard nor saw lost in some sweet sad dream so quite so
silent that more than one thought he slept

After the first glance however the farmers paid him little heed
clustering round the publican at the farther end of the room to hear the
latest story of Owd Bob

It appeared that a week previously James Moore with a pack of sheep had
met the new Grammochtown butcher at the Dalesmens Daughter A bargain
concluded the butcher started with the flock for home As he had no
dog the Master offered him Th Owd Un And hell pick me i th town
tomorrow said he

Now the butcher was a stranger in the land Of course he had heard of
Owd Bob o Kenmuir yet it never struck him that this handsome gentleman
with the quiet resolute manner who handled sheep as he had never seen
them handled was that herothe best sheepdog in the North

Certain it is that by the time the flock was penned in the enclosure
behind the shop he coveted the dogay would even offer ten pounds for
him

Forthwith the butcher locked him up in an outhousesummit of indignity
resolving to make his offer on the morrow

When the morrow came he found no dog in the outhouse and worse no
sheep in the enclosure A sprung board showed the way of escape of the
one and a displaced hurdle that of the other And as he was making the
discovery a gray dog and a flock of sheep travelling along the road
toward the Dalesmans Daughter met the Master

From the first Owd Bob had mistrusted the man The attempt to confine
him set the seal on his suspicions His masters sheep were not for such
a rogue and he worked his own way out and took the sheep along with
him

The story was told to a running chorus ofMa word Good Owd UnHo
ho did he thot

Of them all only MAdam sat strangely silent

Rob Saunderson always glad to draw the little man remarked it

And what dyo think o that Mr MAdam for a wunnerfu story of a
wunnerfu tyke he asked

Its a gude tale a vera gude tale the little man answered dreamily
And James Moore didna invent it he had it from the Christmas number
o the _Flockkeeper_ in saxty On the following Sunday old Rob from
sheer curiosity reached down from his shelf the specified number of the
paper To his amazement he found the little man was right There was the
story almost identically None the less is it also true of Owd Bob o
Kenmuir

Ay ay the little man continued and in a day or two James Moorell
ha anither tale to tell yea better tale yell think itmair
laffable And yetaynoIll no believe it I niver loved James
Moore but I think as Mr Hornbut aince said hed rather die than lie
Owd Bob o Kenmuir he continued in a whisper Up till the end I canna
shake him aff Hafflins I think that where Im gaein to therell be
gray dogs sneakin around me in the twilight And theyre aye behind and
behind and I canna canna

Teddy Bolstock interrupted lifting his hand for silence

Dyo hear thotThunder

They listened and from without came a gurgling jarring roar horrible
to hear

Its comin nearer

Nay its goin away

No thunder thot

More like the Lea in flood And yetEh Mr MAdam what is it

The little man had moved at last He was on his feet staring about him
wildeyed

Wheres yer dogs he almost screamed

Heres maNay by thunder but hes not was the astonished cry

In the interest of the story no man had noticed that his dog had risen
from his side no one had noticed a file of shaggy figures creeping out
of the room

I tell ye its the tykes I tell ye its the tykes Theyre on ma
Wulliefifty to one theyre on him My God My God And me not there
Wullie Wullie in a screamIm wi ye

At the same moment Bessie Boistock rushed in whitefaced

Hi Feyther Mr Saunderson all o you Ttykes fightin mad Hark

There was no time for that Each man seized his stick and rushed for the
door and MAdam led them all

A rare thing it was for MAdam and Red Wull to be apart So rare that
others besides the men in that little taproom noticed it

Saundersons old Shep walked quietly to the back door of the house and
looked out

There on the slope below him he saw what he sought stalking up and
down gaunt and grim like a lion at feedingtime And as the old dog
watched his tail was gently swaying as though he were well pleased

He walked back into the taproom just as Teddy began his tale Twice
he made the round of the room silentfooted From dog to dog he went
stopping at each as though urging him on to some great enterprise Then
he made for the door again looking back to see if any followed

One by one the others rose and trailed out after him big blue Rasper
Londesleys Lassie Ned Hoppins young dog Grip and Grapple the
publicans bullterriers Jim Masons Gyp foolish and flirting even
now others there were and last of all waddling heavily in the rear
that scarred Amazon the Venus

Out of the house they pattered silent and unseen with murder in their
hearts At last they had found their enemy alone And slowly in a black
cloud like the shadow of death they dropped down the slope upon him

And he saw them coming knew their errandas who should better than the
Terror of the Borderand was glad Death it might be and such an
one as he would wish to dieat least distraction from that longdrawn
haunting pain And he smiled grimly as he looked at the approaching
crowd and saw there was not one there but he had humbled in his time

He ceased his restless pacing and awaited them His great head was high
as he scanned them contemptuously daring them to come on

And on they came marching slow and silent like soldiers at a funeral
young and old bobtailed and bull terrier and collie flocking like
vultures to the dead And the Venus heavy with years rolled after them
on her bandy legs panting in her hurry lest she should be late For had
she not the blood of her blood to avenge

So they came about him slow certain murderous opening out to cut
him off on every side There was no need He never thought to move Long
odds twould becrushingly heavy yet he loved them for it and was
trembling already with the glory of the coming fight

They were up to him now the sheepdogs walking round him on their toes
stiff and short like cats on coals their hacks a little humped heads
averted yet eying him askance

And he remained stockstill nor looked at them His great chin was
cocked and his muzzle wrinkled in a dreadful grin As he stood there
shivering a little his eyes rolling back his breath grating in his
throat to set every bristle on end he looked a devil indeed

The Venus ranged alongside him No preliminary stage for her she never
walked where she could stand or stood where she could lie But stand
she must now breathing hard through her nose never taking her eyes off
that pad she had marked for her own Close beside her were cropeared
Grip and Grapple looking up at the line above them where hairy neck and
shoulder joined Behind was big Rasper and close to him Lassie Of the
others each had marked his place each taken up his post

Last of all old Shep took his stand full in front of his enemy their
shoulders almost rubbing head past head

So the two stood a moment as though they were whispering each
diabolical each rolling back his eyes to watch the other While from
the little mob there rose a snarling bubbling snore like some giant
wheezing in his sleep

Then like lightning each struck Rearing high they wrestled with
striving paws and the expression of fiends incarnate Down they went
Shep underneath and the great dog with a dozen of these wolves of hell
upon him Rasper devilish was riding on his back the Venuswell for
himhad struck and missed but Grip and Grapple had their hold and
the others like leaping demoniacs were plunging into the whirlpool
vortex of the fight

And there where a fortnight before he had fought and lost the battle of
the Cup Red Wull now battled for his life

Long odds But what cared he The longdrawn agony of the night was
drowned in that glorious delirium The hate of years came bubbling
forth In that supreme moment he would avenge his wrongs And he went in
to fight revelling like a giant in the red lust of killing

Long odds Never before had he faced such a galaxy of foes His one
chance lay in quickness to prevent the swarming crew getting their hold
till at least he had diminished their numbers

Then it was a sight to see the great brute huge as a bullcalf strong
as a bull rolling over and over and up again quick as a kitten
leaping here striking there shaking himself free swinging his
quarters fighting with feet and body and teethevery inch of him at
war More than once he broke right through the mob only to turn again
and face it No flight for him nor thought of it

Up and down the slope the dark mass tossed like some hulk the sport
of the waves Black and white sable and gray worrying at that great
centrepiece Up and down roaming wide leaving everywhere a trail of
red

Gyp he had pinned and hurled over his shoulder Grip followed he shook
her till she rattled then flung her afar and she fell with a horrid
thud not to rise While Grapple the death to avenge hung tighter In
a scarlet soaking patch of the ground lay Big Bells lurcher doubled
up in a dreadful ball And Hoppins young dog who three hours before
had been the childrens tender playmate now fiendish to look on
dragged after the huddle up the hill Back the mob rolled on her When
it was passed she lay quite still grinning a handful of tawny hair
and flesh in her dead mouth

So they fought on And ever and anon a great figure rose up from the
heaving inferno all around rearing to his full height his head ragged
and bleeding the red foam dripping from his jaws Thus he would appear
momentarily like some dark rock amid a raging sea and down he would go
again

Silent now they fought dumb and determined Only you might have heard
the rend and rip of tearing flesh a hoarse gurgle as some dog went
down the panting of dry throats and now and then a sob from that
central figure For he was fighting for his life The Terror of the
Border was at bay

All who meant it were on him now The Venus blinded with blood had her
hold at last and never but once in a long life of battles had she let
go Rasper his breath coming in rattles had him horribly by the loins
while a dozen other devils with red eyes and wrinkled nostrils clung
still

Long odds And down he went smothered beneath the weight of numbers
yet struggled up again His great head was torn and dripping his eyes a
gleam of rolling red and white the little tail stern and stiff like
the gallant stump of a flagstaff shot away He was desperate but
indomitable and he sobbed as he fought doggedly on

Long odds It could not last And down he went at length silent
stillnever a cry should they wring from him in his agony the Venus
glued to that mangled pad Rasper beneath him now three at his throat
two at his ears a crowd on flanks and body

The Terror of the Border was down at last

     

Wullie ma Wullie screamed MAdam bounding down the slope a crooks
length in front of the rest Wullie Wullie to me

At the shrill cry the huddle below was convulsed It heaved and swelled
and dragged to and fro like the sea lashed into life by some dying
leviathan

A gigantic figure tawny and red fought its way to the surface A great
tossing head bloody past recognition flung out from the ruck One
quick glance he shot from his ragged eyes at the little flying form in
front then with a roar like a waterfall plunged toward it shaking off
the bloody leeches as he went

Wullie Wullie Im wi ye cried that little voice now so near

Throughthroughthroughan incomparable effort and his last They
hung to his throat they clung to his muzzle they were round and about
him And down he went again with a sob and a little suffocating cry
shooting up at his master one quick beseeching glance as the sea of
blood closed over himworrying smothering tearing like foxhounds at
the kill

They left the dead and pulled away the living And it was no light task
for the pack were mad for blood

At the bottom of the wet mess of hair and red and flesh was old Shep
stonedead And as Saunderson pulled the body out his face was working
for no man can lose in a crack the friend of a dozen years and remain
unmoved

The Venus lay there her teeth clenched still in death smiling that her
vengeance was achieved Big Rasper blue no longer was gasping out his
life Two more came crawling out to find a quiet spot where they might
lay them down to die Before the night had fallen another had gone to
his account While not a dog who fought upon that day but carried the
scars of it with him to his grave

The Terror o th Border terrible in his life like Samson was yet
more terrible in his dying

     

Down at the bottom lay that which once had been Adam MAdams Red Wull

At the sight the little man neither raved nor swore it was past that
for him He sat down heedless of the soaking ground and took the
mangled head in his lap very tenderly

Theyve done ye at last Wullietheyve done ye at last he said
quietly unalterably convinced that the attack had been organized while
he was detained in the taproom

On hearing the loved little voice the dog gave one weary wag of his
stumptail And with that the Tailless Tyke Adam MAdams Red Wull the
Black Killer went to his long home

     

One by one the Dalesmen took away their dead and the little man was
left alone with the body of his last friend

Dryeyed he sat there nursing the dead dogs head hour after
houralonecrooning to himself

 Monie a sair daurk we twa hae wrought
 An wi the weary warl fought
 An mony an anxious day I thought
 We wad be beat

An noo we are Wullienoo we are

So he went on repeating the lines over and over again always with the
same sad termination

A mans mithera mans wifea mans dog They three are a little
MAdam iver had to back him Dye mind the auld mither Wullie And her
Niver be downhearted Adam yeve aye got yer mither And ae day I
had not And Flora Wullie ye remember Flora Wullie Na na yed
not wi her laffin daffin manner cryin to one Adam ye say yere
alane But yeve meis that no enough for ony man And God kens
it waswhile it lasted He broke down and sobbed a while And you
Wullieand you the only man friend iver I had He sought the dogs
bloody paw with his right hand

 An heres a hand my trusty fier
 An gies a hand o thine
 An well tak a right guid williewaught
 For auld lang syne

     

He sat there muttering and stroking the poor head upon his lap
bending over it like a mother over a sick child

Theyve done ye at last laddone ye sair And noo Im thinkin
theyll no rest content till Im gone And oh Wulliehe bent down
and whisperedI dreamed sic an awfu thingthat ma Wulliebut there
twas but a dream

So he sat on crooning to the dead dog and no man approached him Only
Bessie of the inn watched the little lone figure from afar

It was long past noon when at length he rose laying the dogs head
reverently down and tottered away toward that bridge which once the
dead thing on the slope had held against a thousand

He crossed it and turned there was a look upon his face half hopeful
half fearful very piteous to see

Wullie Wullie to me he cried only the accents formerly so fiery
were now weak as a dying mans

A while he waited in vain

Are ye no comin Wullie he asked at length in quavering tones
Yeve not used to leave me

He walked away a pace then turned again and whistled that shrill sharp
call only now it sounded like a broken echo of itself

Come to me Wullie he implored very pitifully Tis the first time
iver I kent ye not come and me whistlin What ails ye lad

He recrossed the bridge walking blindly like a sobbing child and yet
dryeyed

Over the dead body he stooped

What ails ye Wullie he asked again Will you too leave me

Then Bessie watching fearfully saw him bend sling the great body on
his back and stagger away

Limp and hideous the carcase hung down from the little mans shoulders
The huge head with grim wide eyes and lolling tongue jolted and
swagged with the motion seeming to grin a ghastly defiance at the world
it had left And the last Bessie saw of them was that bloody rolling
head with the puny legs staggering beneath their load as the two
passed out of the worlds ken

     

In the Devils Bowl next day they found the pair Adam MAdam and his
Red Wull face to face dead not divided each save for the other
alone The dog his saturnine expression glazed and ghastly in the
fixedness of death propped up against that humpbacked boulder beneath
which a while before the Black Killer had dreed his weird and close
by his master lying on his back his dim dead eyes staring up at the
heaven one hand still clasping a crumpled photograph the weary body
at rest at last the mocking facemocking no longeralight with a
wholesouled transfiguring happiness




POSTSCRIPT


Adam MAdam and his Red Wull lie buried together one just within the
other just without the consecrated pale

The only mourners at the funeral were David James Moore Maggie and a
gray dog peering through the lychgate

During the service a carriage stopped at the churchyard and a lady with
a stately figure and a gentle face stepped out and came across the grass
to pay a last tribute to the dead And Lady Eleanour as she joined
the little group about the grave seemed to notice a more than usual
solemnity in the parsons voice as he intoned Earth to earthashes
to ashesdust to dust in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to
eternal life

     

When you wander in the gray hillcountry of the North in the loneliest
corner of that lonely land you may chance upon a low farmhouse lying in
the shadow of the Muir Pike

Entering a tall old man comes out to greet youthe Master of Kenmuir
His shoulders are bent now the hair that was so dark is frosted but
the bluegray eyes look you as proudly in the face as of yore

And while the girl with the glory of yellow hair is preparing food for
youthey are hospitable to a fault these Northernersyou will notice
on the mantelpiece standing solitary a massive silver cup dented

That is the worldknown Shepherds Trophy won outright as the old man
will tell you by Owd Bob last and best of the Gray Dogs of Kenmuir
The last because he is the best because once for a longdrawn unit of
time James Moore had thought him to be the worst

When at length you take your leave the old man accompanies you to the
top of the slope to point you your way

Yo cross the stream over Langholm How yonder past the Bottom and
oop th hill on far side Yoll come on th house o top And happen
yoll meet Th Owd Un on the road Goodday to you sir goodday

So you go as he has bidden you across the stream skirting the How
over the gulf and up the hill again

On the way as the Master has foretold you come upon an old gray dog
trotting soberly along Th Owd Un indeed seems to spend the evening
of his life going thus between Kenmuir and the Grange The black muzzle
is almost white now the gait formerly so smooth and strong is stiff
and slow venerable indeed is he of whom men still talk as the best
sheepdog in the North

As he passes he pauses to scan you The noble head is high and one
foot raised and you look into two big gray eyes such as you have never
seen beforesoft a little dim and infinitely sad

That is Owd Bob o Kenmuir of whom the tales are many as the flowers on
the May With him dies the last of the immortal line of the Gray Dogs of
Kenmuir

     

You travel on up the bill something pensive and knock at the door of
the house on the top

A woman comely with the inevitable comeliness of motherhood opens to
you And nestling in her arms is a little boy with golden hair and happy
face like one of Correggios cherubs

You ask the child his name He kicks and crows and looks up at his
mother and in the end lisps roguishly as if it was the merriest joke
in all this merry world Adum Mataddum
