LITERARY BLUNDERS

A CHAPTER IN THE

_HISTORY OF HUMAN ERROR_

BY
HENRY B WHEATLEY FSA




PREFACE


_EVERY reader of_ The Caxtons
_will remember the description
in that charming novel
of the gradual growth of Augustine
Caxtons great work The History
of Human Error and how in fact
the existence of that work forms the
pivot round which the incidents turn
It was modestly expected to extend to
five quarto volumes but only the first
seven sheets were printed by Uncle
Jacks AntiPublishers Society with
sundry unfinished plates depicting the
various developments of the human
skull that temple of Human Errorp _
and the remainder has not been heard
of since

In introducing to the reader a small
branch of this inexhaustible subject I
have ventured to make use of Augustine
Caxtons title but I trust that
no one will allow himself to imagine
that I intend in the future to produce
the thousand or so volumes which will
be required to complete the work

A satirical friend who has seen the
proofs of this little volume says it
should be entitled Jokes Old and New
but I find that he seldom acknowledges
that a joke is new and I hope therefore
my readers will transpose the
adjectives and accept the old jokes for
the sake of the new ones I may claim
at least that the series of answers to
examination questions which Prof
Oliver Lodge has so kindly supplied
me with comes within the later classp _

I trust that if some parts of the
book are thought to be frivolous the
chapters on lists of errata and misprints
may be found to contain some
useful literary information

I have availed myself of the published
communications of my friends
Professors Hales and Skeat and Dr
Murray on Literary Blunders and
my best thanks are also due to several
friends who have helped me with some
curious instances and I would specially
mention Sir George Birdwood
KCIE CSI Mr Edward Clodd
Mr R B Prosser and Sir Henry
Trueman Wood_p _

LITERARY BLUNDERS

CHAPTER I

BLUNDERS IN GENERAL

THE words blunder and mistake
are often treated as
synonyms thus we usually
call our own blunders mistakes and
our friends style our mistakes blunders
In truth the class of blunders is a sub
division of the _genus_ mistakes Many
mistakes are very serious in their
consequences but there is almost always some
sense of fun connected with a blunder
which is a mistake usually caused by some
mental confusion Lexicographers state
that it is an error due to stupidity and
carelessness but blunders are often causedp 1
p 2by a too great sharpness and quickness
Sometimes a blunder is no mistake at all
as when a man blunders on the right
explanation thus he arrives at the right goal
but by an unorthodox road Sir Roger
LEstrange says that it is one thing to
forget a matter of fact and another to
_blunder_ upon the reason of it

Some years ago there was an article in
the _Saturday Review_ on the knowledge
necessary to make a blunder and this
title gives the clue to what a blunder really
is It is caused by a confusion of two
or more things and unless something is
known of these things a blunder cannot
be made A perfectly ignorant man has
not sufficient knowledge to make a blunder

An ordinary blunder may die and do
no great harm but a literary blunder often
has an extraordinary life Of literary
blunders probably the philological are the
most persistent and the most difficult to
kill In this class may be mentioned 1
Ghost words as they are called by Professor
Skeatwords that is which have been
registered but which never really existed
2 Real words that exist through a misp 3take
and 3 Absurd etymologies a large
division crammed with delicious blunders

1 Professor Skeat in his presidential
address to the members of the Philological
Society in 1886 gave a most interesting
account of some hundred ghost words or
words which have no real existence Those
who wish to follow out this subject must
refer to the _Philological Transactions_ but
four specially curious instances may be
mentioned here These four words are
abacot knise morse and polien
_Abacot_ is defined by Webster as the cap
of state formerly used by English kings
wrought into the figure of two crowns
but Dr Murray when he was preparing
the _New English Dictionary_ discovered
that this was an interloper and unworthy
of a place in the language It was found
to be a mistake for _bycocket_ which is the
correct word In spite of this exposure
of the impostor the word was allowed
to stand with a woodcut of an abacot
in an important dictionary published
subsequently although Dr Murrays
remarks were quoted This shows how
difficult it is to kill a word which has
p 4once found shelter in our dictionaries
_Knise_ is a charming word which first
appeared in a number of the _Edinburgh
Review_ in 1808 Fortunately for the fun
of the thing the word occurred in an
article on Indian Missions by Sydney
Smith We read The Hindoos have
some very strange customs which it would
be desirable to abolish Some swing on
hooks some run _knises_ through their
hands and widows burn themselves to
death The reviewer was attacked for
his statement by Mr John Styles and he
replied in an article on Methodism printed
in the _Edinburgh_ in the following year
Sydney Smith wrote Mr Styles is
peculiarly severe upon us for not being more
shocked at their piercing their limbs with
_knises_    it is for us to explain the plan
and nature of this terrible and unknown
piece of mechanism A _knise_ then is
neither more nor less than a false print in
the _Edinburgh Review_ for a knife and
from this blunder of the printer has Mr
Styles manufactured this Daedalean instrument
of torture called a _knise_ A similar
instance occurs in a misprint of a passage
p 5of one of Scotts novels but here there is
the further amusing circumstance that the
etymology of the false word was settled to
the satisfaction of some of the readers In
the majority of editions of _The Monastery_
chapter x we read Hardened wretch
said Father Eustace art thou but this
instant delivered from death and dost thou
so soon morse thoughts of slaughter
This word is nothing but a misprint of
_nurse_ but in _Notes and Queries_ two
independent correspondents accounted for the
word _morse_ etymologically One explained
it as to prime as when one primes a
musket from O Fr _amorce_ powder for the
touchhole Cotgrave and the other by to
bite Lat _mordere_ hence to indulge
in biting stinging or gnawing thoughts of
slaughter The latter writes That the
word as a misprint should have been
printed and read by millions for fifty
years without being challenged and altered
exceeds the bounds of probability Yet
when the original MS of Sir Walter Scott
was consulted it was found that the word
was there plainly written _nurse_

The Saxon letter for _th_ p has long
p 6been a sore puzzle to the uninitiated and
it came to be represented by the letter y
Most of those who think they are writing
in a specially archaic manner when they
spell ye for the are ignorant of this
and pronounce the article as if it were the
pronoun Dr Skeat quotes a curious instance
of the misreading of the thorn p
as _p_ by which a strange ghost word is
evolved Whitaker in his edition of Piers
Plowman reads that Christ _polede_ for
man which should be _tholede_ from
_tholien_ to suffer as there is no such
verb as _polien_

Dr J A H Murray the learned editor
of the Philological Societys _New English
Dictionary_ quotes two amusing instances
of ghost words in a communication to
_Notes and Queries_ 7th S vii 305 He
says Possessors of Jamiesons Scottish
Dictionary will do well to strike out the
fictitious entry _cietezour_ cited from Bellendens
_Chronicle_ in the plural _cietezouris_
which is merely a misreading of cietezanis
_ie_ with Scottish z  z  y _cieteyanis_ or
citeyanis Bellendens regular word for
_citizens_ One regrets to see this absurd
p 7mistake copied from Jamieson unfortunately
without acknowledgment by the
compilers of Cassells _Encyclopaedic Dictionary_

Some editions of Draytons _Barons
Wars_ Bk VI st xxxvii read

  And ciffy Cynthus with a thousand birds

which nonsense is solemnly reproduced in
Campbells _Specimens of the British Poets_
iii 16 It may save some readers a needless
reference to the dictionary to remember
that it is a misprint for cliffy a favourite
word of Draytons

2 In contrast to supposed words that
never did exist are real words that exist
through a mistake such as _apron_ and _adder_
where the _n_ which really belongs to the
word itself has been supposed mistakenly
to belong to the article thus apron should
be napron Fr _naperon_ and adder should
be nadder AS _naeddre_ An amusing
confusion has arisen in respect to the
Ridings of Yorkshire of which there are
three The word should be _triding_ but
the _t_ has got lost in the adjective as West
Triding became West Riding The origin of
p 8the word has thus been quite lost sight of
and at the first organisation of the Province
of Upper Canada in 1798 the county of
Lincoln was divided into _four_ ridings and
the county of York into _two_ York was
afterwards supplied with _four_

Sir Henry Bennet in the reign of
Charles II took his title of Earl of
Arlington owing to a blunder The proper
name of the village in Middlesex is
Harlington

A curious misunderstanding in the
Marriage Service has given us two words
instead of one We now vow to remain
united till death us _do part_ but the
original declaration as given in the first
Prayer Book of Edward VI was I N
take thee N to my wedded wife to have
and to hold from this day forward for
better for worse for richer for poorer in
sickness and in health to love and to
cherish till death us depart or separate

It is not worth while here to register the
many words which have taken their present
spelling through a mistaken view of their
etymology They are too numerous and
the consideration of them would open up a
p 9question quite distinct from the one now
under consideration

3 Absurd etymology was once the rule
because guessing without any knowledge
of the historical forms of words was
general and still in spite of the modern
school of philology which has shown us
the right way much wild guessing continues
to be prevalent It is not however
often that we can point to such a brilliant
instance of blundering etymology as that
to be found in Barlows English Dictionary
1772 The word _porcelain_ is there
said to be derived from _pour cent annes_
French for a hundred years it having been
imagined that the materials were matured
underground for that term of years

Richardson the novelist suggests an
etymology almost equal to this He
writes What does correspondence mean
It is a word of Latin origin a compound
word and the two elements here brought
together are _respondeo_ I answer and _cor_
the heart _ie_ I answer feelingly I reply
not so much to the head as to the heart

Dr Ashs English Dictionary published
in 1775 is an exceedingly useful work as
p 10containing many words and forms of words
nowhere else registered but it contains
some curious mistakes The chief and
bestknown one is the explanation of the
word _curmudgeon_from the French
coeur unknown and _mechant_ a correspondent
The only explanation of this
absurdly confused etymology is that an
ignorant man was employed to copy from
Johnsons Dictionary where the authority
was given as an unknown correspondent
and he supposing these words to be a
translation of the French set them down
as such The two words _esoteric_ and
_exoteric_ were not so frequently used in the
last century as they are now so perhaps
there may be some excuse for the following
entry Esoteric adj an incorrect
spelling exoteric Dr Ash could not
have been well read in Arthurian literature
or he would not have turned the noble
knight Sir Gawaine into a woman the
sister of King Arthur There is a story
of a blunder in Littletons Latin Dictionary
which further research has proved to be
no mistake at all It is said that when
the Doctor was compiling his work and
p 11announced the word _concurro_ to his
amanuensis the scribe imagining from the
sound that the six first letters would give
the translation of the verb said Concur
sir I suppose to which the Doctor
peevishly replied Concurcondog
and in the edition of 1678 condog is
printed as one interpretation of _concurro_
Now an answer to this story is that however
odd a word condog may appear
it will be found in Henry Cockerams
_English Dictionarie_ first published in
1623 The entry is as follows to agree
concurre cohere condog condiscend

Mistakes are frequently made in respect
of foreign words which retain their original
form especially those which retain their
Latin plurals the feminine singular being
often confused with the neuter plural For
instance there is the word _animalcule_
plural _animalcules_ also written _animalculum
_plural _animalcula_ Now the
plural _animalcula_ is often supposed to be
the feminine singular and a new plural is
at once made_animalculae_ This blunder
is one constantly being made while it is
only occasionally we see a supposed plural
p 12_stratae_ in geology from a supposed singular
strata and the supposed singular _formulum_
from a supposed plural _formula_ will probably
turn up some day

In connection with popular etymology
it seems proper to make a passing mention
of the sailors perversion of the Bellerophon
into the Billy Ruffian the Hirondelle
into the Iron Devil and La Bonne
Corvette into the Bonny Cravat Some
of the supposed changes in publichouse
signs such as Bull and Mouth from
Boulogne mouth and Goat and Compasses
from God encompasseth us are
more than doubtful but the Bacchanals
has certainly changed into the Bag o nails
and the George Canning into the George
and Cannon The words in the language
that have been formed from a false analogy
are so numerous and have so often been
noted that we must not allow them to
detain us here longer

Imaginary persons have been brought
into being owing to blundering misreading
For instance there are many saints
in the Roman calendar whose individuality
it would not be easy to prove All
p 13know how St Veronica came into being
and equally well known is the origin of
St Ursula and her eleven thousand virgins
In this case through the misreading of
her name the unfortunate virgin martyr
Undecimilla has dropped out of the
calendar

Less known is the origin of Saint Xynoris
the martyr of Antioch who is noticed in
the _Martyrologie Romaine_ of Baronius
Her name was obtained by a misreading
of Chrysostom who referring to two
martyrs uses the word gr xunwris couple or
pair

In the City of London there is a church
dedicated to St Vedast which is situated
in Foster Lane and is often described as
St Vedast _alias_ Foster This has puzzled
many and James Paterson in his _Pietas
Londinensis_ 1714 hazarded the opinion
that the church was dedicated to two
conjunct saints He writes At the
first it was called St Fosters in memory
of some founder or ancient benefactor
but afterwards it was dedicated to St
Vedast Bishop of Arras Newcourt
makes a similar mistake in his
_Reperp 14torium_ but Thomas Fuller knew the
truth and in his _Church History_ refers to
St Vedastus _anglice_ St Fosters This
is the fact and the name St Fauster or
Foster is nothing more than a corruption
of St Vedast all the steps of which we
now know My friend Mr Danby P Fry
worked this out some years ago but his
difficulty rested with the second syllable
of the name Foster but the links in the
chain of evidence have been completed
by reference to Mr H C Maxwell Lytes
valuable Report on the Manuscripts of the
Dean and Chapter of St Pauls The
first stage in the corruption took place in
France and the name must have been
introduced into this country as Vast
This loss of the middle consonant is in
accordance with the constant practice in
early French of dropping out the consonant
preceding an accented vowel as
_reine_ from _regina_ The change of
_Augustine_ to _Austin_ is an analogous
instance _Vast_ would here be pronounced
_Vaust_ in the same way as the word _vase_
is still sometimes pronounced _vause_ The
interchange of _v_ and _f_ as in the cases of
p 15_Vane_ and _Fane_ and _fox_ and _vixen_ is too
common to need more than a passing
notice We have now arrived at the form
St Faust and the evidence of the old
deeds of St Pauls explains the rest
showing us that the second syllable has grown
out of the possessive case In one of
8 Edward III we read of the Kings
highway called Seint Fastes lane Of
course this was pronounced St _Faustes_
and we at once have the two syllables
The next form is in a deed of May 1360
where it stands as Seyn Fastreslane
We have here not a final _r_ as in the latest
form but merely an intrusive trill This
follows the rule by which thesaurus became
_treasure Hebudas Hebrides_ and _culpatus
culprit_ After the great Fire of London
the church was renamed St Vedast _alias_
Fostera form of the name which it
had never borne before except in Latin
deeds as Vedastus1 More might be said
p 16of the corruptions of names in the cases
of other saints but these corruptions are
more the cause of blunders in others than
blunders in themselves It is not often
that a new saint is evolved with such an
English name as Foster


 1 See an article by the Author in _The Athenaeum_
January 3rd 1885 p 15 and a paper by the
Rev W Sparrow Simpson in the _Jourral of
the British Archaeological Association_ vol xliii
p 56



The existence of the famous St Vitus
has been doubted and his dance _Chorea
Sancti Vitae_ is supposed to have been
originally _chorea invita_ But the strangest
of saints was S Viar who is thus accounted
for by DIsraeli in his _Curiosities of
Literature_

Mabillon has preserved a curious
literary blunder of some pious Spaniards
who applied to the Pope for consecrating a
day in honour of Saint Viar His Holiness
in the voluminous catalogue of his saints
was ignorant of this one The only proof
brought forward for his existence was this
inscription

 S VIAR

An antiquary however hindered one more
festival in the Catholic calendar by
convincing them that these letters were only
the remains of an inscription erected for
p 17an ancient surveyor of the roads and he
read their saintship thus

 PREFECTVS VIARVM


Foreign travellers in England have
usually made sad havoc of the names of
places Hentzner spelt Grays Inn and
Lincolns Inn phonetically as Grezin and
Linconsin and so puzzled his editor that he
supposed these to be the names of two
giants A similar mistake to this was that
of the man who boasted that not all the
British House of Commons not the whole
bench of Bishops not even Leviticus himself
should prevent him from marrying his
deceased wifes sister One of the jokes
in Mark Twains _Huckleberry Finn_
ch xxiii turns on the use of this same
expression Leviticus himself

The picturesque writer who draws a
wellfilledin picture from insufficient data
is peculiarly liable to fall into blunders
and when he does fall it is not surprising
that less imaginative writers should
chuckle over his fall A few years ago
an American editor is said to have received
the telegram Oxford Music Hall
p 18burned to the ground There was not
much information here and he was ignorant
of the fact that this building was in
London and in Oxford Street but he was
equal to the occasion He elaborated a
remarkable account of the destruction
by fire of the principal music hall of
academic Oxford He told how it was
situated in the midst of historic colleges
which had miraculously escaped destruction
by the flames These flames fanned
into a fury by a favourable wind lit up
the academic spires and groves as they
ran along the rich cornices lapped the
gorgeous pillars shrivelled up the roof
and grasped the mighty walls of the
ancient building in their destructive
embraces

In 1882 an announcement was made
in a weekly paper that some prehistoric
remains had been found near the Church
of San Francisco Florence The note
was reproduced in an evening paper and
in an antiquarian monthly with words in
both cases implying that the locality of
the find was San Francisco California
It is a common mistake of those who
p 19have heard of Grolier bindings to suppose
that the eminent book collector was a
binder but this is nothing to that of the
workman who told the writer of this that
he had found out the secret of making
the famous Henri II or Oiron ware In
fact he added I could make it as well
as Henry Deux himself The idea of the
king of France working in the potteries
is exceedingly fine

Family pride is sometimes the cause
of exceedingly foolish blunders The
following amusing passage in Andersons
_Genealogical History of the House of Yvery_
1742 illustrates a form of pride ridiculed
by Lord Chesterfield when he set up on
his walls the portraits of Adam de Stanhope
and Eve de Stanhope The having a
stutterer in the family will appear to most
readers to be a strange cause of pride
The author writes It was usual in ancient
times with the greatest families and is by
all genealogists allowed to be a mighty
evidence of dignity to use certain nicknames
which the French call sobriquets   
such as the Lame or the Black  
The house of Yvery not deficient in any
p 20mark or proof of greatness and antiquity
abounds at different periods in instances
of this nature Roger a younger son of
William Youel de Perceval was surnamed
Balbus or the Stutterer

Sometimes a blunder has turned out
fortunate in its consequences and a
striking instance of this is recorded in the
history of Prussia Frederic I charged
his ambassador Bartholdi with the mission
of procuring from the Emperor of Germany
an acknowledgment of the regal
dignity which he had just assumed It
is said that instructions written in cypher
were sent to him with particular directions
that he should not apply on this subject
to Father Wolff the Emperors confessor
The person who copied these instructions
however happened to omit the word _not_
in the copy in cypher Bartholdi was
surprised at the order but obeyed it and
made the matter known to Wolff who
in the greatest astonishment declared that
although he had always been hostile to
the measure he could not resist this
proof of the Electors confidence which
had made a deep impression upon him
p 21It was thought that the mediation of the
confessor had much to do with the
accomplishment of the Electors wishes

Misquotations form a branch of literary
blunders which may be mentioned here

The text He may run that readeth
it Hab ii 2 is almost invariably
quoted as He who runs may read
and the Divine condemnation In the
sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
Gen iii 19 is usually quoted as sweat
of thy brow

The manner in which Dr Johnson
selected the quotations for his Dictionary
is well known and as a general rule
these are tolerably accurate but under
the thirteenth heading of the verb to
sit will be found a curious perversion
of a text of Scripture There we read
Asses are ye that sit in judgement
_Judges_ but of course there is no such
passage in the Bible The correct reading
of the tenth verse of the fifth chapter is
Speak ye that ride on white asses ye
that sit in judgment and walk by the
way

From misquotations it is an easy step
p 22to pass to mispronunciations These are
mostly too common to be amusing but
sometimes the blunderers manage to hit
upon something which is rather comic
Thus an ignorant reader coming upon a
reference to an angle of fortyfive degrees
was puzzled and astonished his hearers
by giving it out as _angel_ of fortyfive
degrees This blunderer however was
outdone by the speaker who described a
distinguished personage as a very
indefatemgable young man adding but even
he must succuumb suck um at last

As has already been said blunders are
often made by those who are what we
usually call too clever by half Surely
it was a blunder to change the time
honoured name of Kings Bench to
Queens Bench A queen is a female
king and she reigns as a king the
absurdity of the change of sex in the
description is more clearly seen when
we find in a Prayerbook published soon
after the Queens accession Her Majesty
described as our Queen and _Governess_

Editors of classical authors are often
laughed at for their emendations but
p 23sometimes unjustly When we consider
the crop of blunders that have gathered
about the texts of celebrated books we
shall be grateful for the labours of brilliant
scholars who have cleared these away
and made obscure passages intelligible

One of the most remarkable emendations
ever made by an editor is that of
Theobald in Mrs Quicklys description of
Falstaffs deathbed _King Henry V_ act ii
sc 4 The original is unintelligible
his nose was as sharp as a pen and a
table of greene fields A friend suggested
that it should read  a talked and
Theobald then suggested  a babbled a reading
which has found its way into all texts
and is never likely to be ousted from its
place Colliers MS corrector turned the
sentence into as a pen on a table of
green frieze Very few who quote this
passage from Shakespeare have any notion
of how much they owe to Theobald

Sometimes blunders are intentionally
mademalapropisms which are understood
by the speakers intimates but often
astonish strangerssuch as the expressions
the sinecure of every eye as white
p 24as the drivelling snow2 Of intentional
mistakes the best known are those which
have been called cross readings in which
the reader is supposed to read across the
page instead of down the column of a
newspaper with such results as the following


 2 See _Spectator_ December 24th 1887 for
specimens of family lingo



A new Bank was lately opened at
Northamptonpointer no money returned

The Speakers public dinners will
commence next weekadmittance 3 to
see the animals fed

As blunders are a class of mistakes so
bulls are a subclass of blunders No
satisfactory explanation of the word has
been given although it appears to be
intimately connected with the word
blunder Equally the thing itself has not
been very accurately defined

The author of _A New Booke of Mistakes_
1637 which treats of Quips
Taunts Retorts Flowts Frumps Mockes
Gibes Jestes etc says in his address to
the Reader There are moreover other
simple mistakes in speech which pass
p 25under the name of Bulls but if any man
shall demand of mee why they be so
called I must put them off with this
womans reason they are so because they
bee so All the author can affirm is
that they have no connection with the
inns and playhouses of his time styled
the Black Bulls and the Red Bulls
Coleridges definition is the best A
bull consists in a mental juxtaposition of
incongruous ideas with the sensation but
without the sense of connection3


 3 Southeys _Omniana_ vol i p 220



Bulls are usually associated with the
Irish but most other nations are quite
capable of making them and Swift is said
to have intended to write an essay on
English bulls and blunders Sir Thomas
Trevor a Baron of the Exchequer 162549
when presiding at the Bury Assizes had a
cause about wintering of cattle before him
He thought the charge immoderate and
said Why friend this is most unreasonable
I wonder thou art not ashamed for
I myself have known a beast wintered one
whole summer for a noble The man at
p 26once with ready wit cried That was a
_bull_ my lord Whereat the company
was highly amused4


 4 Thoms _Anecdotes and Traditions_ 1839 p

One of the bestknown bulls is that
inscribed on the obelisk near Fort William
in the Highlands of Scotland In this
inscription a very clumsy attempt is made
to distinguish between natural tracks and
made roads

 Had you seen these roads before they were made
 You would lift up your hands and bless General Wade


The bulletins of Pope Clement XIVs
last illness which were announced at the
Vatican culminated in a very fair bull
The notices commenced with His Holiness
is very ill and ended with His
Infallibility is delirious

Negro bulls have frequently been
reported but the health once proposed by
a worthy black is perhaps as good an
instance as could be cited He pledged
De Gobernor ob our State He come
p 27in wid much opposition he go out wid
none at all

Still in spite of the fact that all nations
fall into these blunders and that as it
has been said of some _Hibernicis ipsis
Hibernior_ it is to Ireland that we look
for the finest examples of bulls and we
do not usually look in vain

It is in a Belfast paper that may be
read the account of a murder the result
of which is described thus They fired
two shots at him the first shot killed
him but the second was not fatal
Connoisseurs in bulls will probably say that
this is only a blunder Perhaps the
following will please them better A man
was run down by a passenger train and
killed he was injured in a similar way a
year ago

Here are three good bulls which fulfil
all the conditions we expect in this branch
of wit We know what the writer means
although he does not exactly say it This
passage is from the report of an Irish
Benevolent Society Notwithstanding
the large amount paid for medicine and
medical attendance very few deaths
p 28occurred during the year A country
editors correspondent wrote Will you
please to insert this obituary notice I
make bold to ask it because I know the
deceased had a great many friends who
would be glad to hear of his death The
third is quoted in the _Greville Memoirs_
He abjured the errors of the Romish
Church and embraced those of the
Protestant

It is said that the Irish Statute Book
opens characteristically with An Act
that the Kings officers may travel _by sea_
from one place to another within the _land_
of Ireland but one of the main objects
of the _Essay on Irish Bulls_ by Maria
Edgeworth and her father Richard Lovell
Edgeworth was to show that the title of
their work was incorrect They find the
original of Paddy Blakes echo in Bacons
works I remember well that when I
went to the echo at Port Charenton there
was an old Parisian that took it to be the
work of spirits and of good spirits for
said he call Satan and the echo will not
deliver back the devils name but will
say Vaten   Mr Hill Burton found
p 29the original of Sir Boyle Roches bull of
the bird which was in two places at once
in a letter of a ScotsmanRobertson of
Rowan Steele said that all was the effect
of climate and that if an Englishman were
born in Ireland he would make as many
bulls Mistakes of an equally absurd
character may be found in English Acts
of Parliament such as this The new
gaol to be built from the materials of
the old one and the prisoners to remain
in the latter till the former is ready or
the disposition of the prisoners punishment
of transportation for seven years
half to go to the king and the other half
to the informer Peter Harrison an
annotator on the Pentateuch observed of
Moses two _tables of stone_ that they were
made of _shittim wood_ This is not unlike
the title said to have been used for a useful
little workEvery man his own Washer
woman Horace Walpole said that the
best of all bulls was that of the man who
complaining of his nurse said I hate
that woman for she changed me at
nurse But surely this one quoted by
Mr Hill Burton is far superior to Horace
p 30Walpoles in fact one of the best ever
conceived Result of a duelThe one
party received a slight wound in the
breast the other fired in the airand
so the matter terminated

After this the description of the wrongs
of Ireland has a somewhat artificial look
Her cup of misery has been overflowing
and is not yet full



CHAPTER II

BLUNDERS OF AUTHORS

MACAULAY in his life of
Goldsmith in the _Encyclopaedia
Britannica_ relates that that
author in the _History of England_ tells
us that Naseby is in Yorkshire and that
the mistake was not corrected when the
book was reprinted He further affirms
that Goldsmith was nearly hoaxed into
putting into the _History of Greece_ an
account of a battle between Alexander the
Great and Montezuma This however
is scarcely a fair charge for the backs of
most of us need to be broad enough to
bear the actual blunders we have made
throughout life without having to bear
those which we almost made

Goldsmith was a very remarkable
instance of a man who undertook to write
books on subjects of which he knew
p 32nothing Thus Johnson said that if he
could tell a horse from a cow that was
the extent of his knowledge of zoology
and yet the _History of Animated Nature_
can still be read with pleasure from the
charm of the authors style

Some authors are so careless in the
construction of their works as to contradict in
one part what they have already stated in
another In the year 1828 an amusing
work was published on the clubs of
London which contained a chapter on
Fighting Fitzgerald of whom the author
writes That Mr Fitzgerald unlike his
countrymen generally was totally devoid
of generosity no one who ever knew him
will doubt In another chapter on the
same person the author flatly contradicts
his own judgment In summing up the
catalogue of his vices however we ought
not to shut our eyes upon his virtues of
the latter he certainly possessed that one
for which his countrymen have always
been so famous generosity The scissors
andpaste compilers are peculiarly liable
to such errors as these and a writer in
the _Quarterly Review_ proved the _Memoires
p 33de Louis XVIII_ published in 1832 to
be a mendacious compilation from the
_Memoires de Bachaumont_ by giving examples
of the compilers blundering One
of these muddles is well worth quoting
and it occurs in the following passage
Seven bishopsof _Puy_ Gallard de
Terraube of _Langres_ La Luzerne of
_Rhodez_ SeignelayColbert of _Gast_ Le
Tria of _Blois_ Laussiere Themines of
_Nancy_ Fontanges of _Alais_ Beausset
of _Nevers_ Seguiran Had the compiler
taken the trouble to count his own list
he would have seen that he had given
eight names instead of seven and so have
suspected that something was wrong but
he was not paid to think The fact is
that there is no such place as Gast and
there was no such person as Le Tria The
Bishop of Rhodez was SeignelayColbert
de Castle Hill a descendant of the Scotch
family of Cuthbert of Castle Hill in
Invernessshire and Bachaumont misled
his successor by writing Gast Le Hill for
Castle Hill The introduction of a stop
and a little more misspelling resulted in
the blunder as we now find it
p 34

Authors and editors are very apt to take
things for granted and they thus fall into
errors which might have been escaped if
they had made inquiries Pope in a note
on _Measure for Measure_ informs us that the
story was taken from Cinthios novel _Dec_ 8
_Nov_ 5 thus contracting the words decade
and novel Warburton in his edition of
Shakespeare was misled by these contractions
and fills them up as December 8
and November 5 Many blunders are
merely clerical errors of the authors who
are led into them by a curious association
of ideas thus in the _Lives of the
Londonderrys_ Sir Archibald Alison when
describing the funeral of the Duke of
Wellington in St Pauls speaks of one of
the pallbearers as Sir Peregrine Pickle
instead of Sir Peregrine Maitland Dickens
in _Bleak House_ calls Harold Skimpole
Leonard throughout an entire number
but returns to the old name in a subsequent one

Few authors require to be more on their
guard against mistakes than historians
especially as they are peculiarly liable to
fall into them What shall we think of
p 35the authority of a school book when we
find the statement that Louis Napoleon
was Consul in 1853 before he became
Emperor of the French

We must now pass from a book of small
value to an important work on the history
of England but it will be necessary first to
make a few explanatory remarks Our
readers know that English kings for several
centuries claimed the power of curing
scrofula or kings evil but they may not be
so well acquainted with the fact that the
French sovereigns were believed to enjoy
the same miraculous power Such however
was the case and tradition reported
that a phial filled with holy oil was sent
down from heaven to be used for the
anointing of the kings at their coronation
We can illustrate this by an anecdote of
Napoleon Lafayette and the first Consul
had a conversation one day on the government
of the United States Bonaparte
did not agree with Lafayettes views and
the latter told him that he was desirous
of having the little phial broke over his
head This _sainte ampulle_ or holy
vessel was an important object in the
p 36ceremony and the virtue of the oil was to
confer the power of cure upon the anointed
king This the historian could not have
known or he would not have written
The French were confident in themselves
in their fortunes in the special
gifts by which they held the stars If
this were all the information that was
given us we should be left in a perfect
state of bewilderment while trying to
understand how the French could hold
the stars or if they were able to hold
them what good it would do them but
the historian adds a note which although
it contains some new blunders gives the
clue to an explanation of an otherwise
inexplicable passage It is as follows
The Cardinal of Lorraine showed Sir
William Pickering the precious ointment
of St Ampull wherewith the King of
France was sacred which he said was sent
from heaven above a thousand years ago
and since by miracle preserved through
whose virtue also the king held _les
estroilles_ From this we might imagine
that the holy Ampulla was a person but
the clue to the whole confusion is to be
p 37found in the last word of the sentence
As the French language does not contain
any such word as _estroilles_ there can be
no doubt that it stands for old French
_escroilles_ or the kings evil The change
of a few letters has here made the mighty
difference between the power of curing
scrofula and the gift of holding the stars

In some copies of John Brittons
_Descriptive Sketches of Tunbridge Wells_
1832 the following extraordinary passage
will be found Judge Jefferies a man
who has rendered his name infamous in
the annals of history by the cruelty and
injustice he manifested in presiding at the
trial of King Charles I The book was
no sooner issued than the author became
aware of his astonishing chronological
blunder and he did all in his power to set
the matter right but a mistake in print
can never be entirely obliterated However
much trouble may be taken to suppress
a book some copies will be sure to
escape and becoming valuable by the
attempted suppression attract all the more
attention

Scott makes David Ramsay in the
p 38_Fortunes of Nigel_ chapter ii swear by
the bones of the immortal Napier It
would perhaps be rank heresy to suppose
that Sir Walter did not know that
Napiers bones were an apparatus for
purposes of calculation but he certainly
puts the expression in such an ambiguous
form that many of his readers are likely
to suppose that the actual bones of
Napiers body were intended

Some of the most curious of blunders
are those made by learned men who without
thought set down something which at
another time they would recognise as a
mistake The following passage from
Mr Gladstones _Gleanings of Past Years_
vol i p 26 in which the author confuses
Daniel with Shadrach Meshech and
Abednego has been pointed out The
fierce light that beats upon a throne is
sometimes like the heat of that furnace in
which only Daniel could walk unscathed
too fierce for those whose place it is to
stand in its vicinity Who would expect
to find Macaulay blundering on a subject
he knew so well as the story of the
_Faerie Queene_ and yet this is what he
p 39wrote in a review of Southeys edition
of the _Pilgrims Progress_ Nay even
Spenser himself though assuredly one of
the greatest poets that ever lived could
not succeed in the attempt to make allegory
interesting    One unpardonable
fault the fault of tediousness pervades
the whole of the _Fairy Queen_ We become
sick of Cardinal Virtues and Deadly
Sins and long for the society of plain men
and women Of the persons who read
the first Canto not one in ten reaches the
end of the first book and not one in a
hundred perseveres to the end of the
poem Very few and very weary are
those who are in at the death of the
Blatant Beast5 Macaulay knew well
enough that the Blatant Beast did not
die in the poem as Spenser left it


 5 _Edinburgh Review_ vol liv 1831 p 452



The newspaper writers are great sinners
and what with the frequent ignorance and
haste of the authors and the carelessness
of the printers a complete farrago of
nonsense is sometimes concocted between
them A proper name is seldom given
correctly in a daily paper and it is a
p 40frequently heard remark that no notice of
an event is published in which an error in
the names or qualifications of the actors
in it is not detected by those acquainted
with the circumstances The contributor
of the following bit of information to the
_Weeks News_ Nov 18th 1871 must
have had a very vague notion of what a
monosyllable is or he would not have
written The author of _Dorothy De
Cressy_ etc has another novel nearly
ready for the press which with the writers
partiality for monosyllabic titles is named
_Thomasina_ He is perhaps the same
person who remarked on the late Mr
Robertsons fondness for monosyllables
as titles for his plays and after instancing
_Caste Ours_ and _School_ ended his list with
_Society_ We can however fly at higher
game than this for some twenty years ago
a writer in the _Times_ fell into the mistake
of describing the entrance of one of the
German states into the Zollverein in terms
that proved him to be labouring under
the misconception that the great Customs
Union was a new organisation Another
source of error in the papers is the hurry
p 41with which bits of news are printed
before they have been authenticated Each
editor wishes to get the start of his
neighbour and the consequence is that they
are frequently deceived In a number of
the _Literary Gazette_ for 1837 there is a
paragraph headed Sir Michael Faraday
in which the great philosopher is
congratulated upon the title which had been
conferred upon him Another source of
blundering is the attempt to answer an
opponent before his argument is thoroughly
understood A few years ago a
gentleman made a note in the _Notes and
Queries_ to the effect that a certain custom
was at least 1400 years old and was probably
introduced into England in the fifth
century Soon afterwards another gentleman
wrote to the same journal Assuredly
this custom was general before AD 1400
but how he obtained that date out of the
previous communication no one can tell

The _Times_ made a strange blunder in
describing a gallery of pictures Mr
Robertsons group of Susannah and the
Elders with the name of Pordenone
contains some passages of glowing colour
p 42which must be set off against a good deal
of clumsy drawing in the central figure of
the chaste _maiden_ As bad as this was
the confusion in the mind of the critic of
the New Gallery who spoke of Mr Halles
_Paolo and Francesca_ as that masterly
study and production of the old Adam
phase of human nature which Milton
hit off so sublimely in the _Inferno_

A writer in the _Notes and Queries_
confused Beersheba with Bathsheba and
conferred on the woman the name of the
place

It has often been remarked that a
thorough knowledge of the English Bible
is an education of itself and a
correspondence in the _Times_ in August 1888
shows the value of a knowledge of the
Liturgy of the Church of England In a
leading article occurred the passage We
have no doubt whatever that Scotch
judges and juries will administer indifferent
justice A correspondent in Glasgow
who supposed _indifferent_ to mean _inferior_
wrote to complain at the insinuation
that a Scotch jury would not do its
duty The editor of the _Times_ had little
p 43difficulty in answering this by referring to
the prayer for the Church militant where
are the words Grant unto her the
Queens whole Council and to all that
are put in authority under her that they
may truly and indifferently minister justice
to the punishment of wickedness and vice
and to the maintenance of Thy true
religion and virtue

The compiler of an Anthology made
the following remarks in his preface In
making a selection of this kind one sails
between Scylla and Charybdisthe hackneyed
and the strange I have done my
best to steer clear of both these rocks
A leaderwriter in a morning paper a
few months ago made the same blunder
when he wrote As a matter of fact Mr
Gladstone was bound to bump against
either Scylla or Charybdis It has
generally been supposed that Scylla only was
a rock

A most extraordinary blunder was made
in _Scientific American_ eight or ten years
ago An engraving of a handsome Chelsea
china vase was presented with the
following description In England no
p 44regular hard porcelain is made but a
soft porcelain of great beauty is produced
from kaolin phosphate of lime
and calcined silica The principal works
are situated at Chelsea The export of
these English porcelains is considerable
and it is a curious fact that they are
largely imported into China where they
are highly esteemed Our engraving
shows a richly ornamented vase in soft
porcelain from the works at Chelsea
It could scarcely have been premised
that any one would be so ignorant as
to suppose that Chelsea china was still
manufactured and this paragraph is a
good illustration of the evils of journalists
writing on subjects about which they know
nothing

Critics who are supposed to be immaculate
often blunder when sitting in judgment
on the sins of authors They are
frequently puzzled by reprints and led into
error by the disinclination of publishers
to give particulars in the preface as
to a book which was written many
years before its republication A few
years ago was issued a reprint of the
p 45translation of the _Arabian Nights_ by
Jonathan Scott LLD which was first
published in 1811 A reviewer having
the book before him overlooked this
important fact and straightway proceeded
to slate Dr Scott for his supposed
work of supererogation in making a new
translation when Lanes held the field the
fact really being that Scotts translation
preceded Lanes by nearly thirty years

Another critic having to review a
reprint of Galts _Lives of Players_ complained
that Mr Galt had not brought his book
down to the date of publication being
ignorant of the fact that John Galt died
as long ago as 1839 The reviewer of
Lambs _Tales from Shakespeare_ committed
the worst blunder of all when he wrote
that those persons who did not know
their Shakespeare might read Mr
Lambs paraphrase if they liked but for
his part he did not see the use of such
works The man who had never heard
of Charles Lamb and his _Tales_ must have
very much mistaken his vocation when he
set up as a literary critic

These are all genuine cases but the
p 46story of Lord Campbell and his criticism
of _Romeo and Juliet_ is almost too good to
be true It is said that when the future
Lord Chancellor first came to London
he went to the editor of the _Morning
Chronicle_ for some work The editor
sent him to the theatre Plain John
Campbell had no idea he was witnessing
a play of Shakespeare and he therefore
set to work to sketch the plot of _Romeo
and Juliet_ and to give the author a little
wholesome advice He recommended a
curtailment in parts so as to render it
more suitable to the taste of a cultivated
audience We can quite understand that
if a story like this was once set into
circulation it was not likely to be allowed to
die by the many who were glad to have a
laugh at the rising barrister



CHAPTER III

BLUNDERS OF TRANSLATORS

THE blunders of translators are so
common that they have been
made to point a moral in popular
proverbs According to an Italian saying
_translators are traitors_ I traduttori sono
traditori and books are said to be _done_
into English _traduced_ in French and _overset_
in Dutch Colton the author of _Lacon_
mentions a halfstarved German at Cambridge
named Render who had been long
enough in England to forget German but
not long enough to learn English This
worthy in spite of his deficiencies was a
voluminous translator of his native
literature and it became a proverbial saying
among his intimates respecting a bad
translation that it was _Rendered_ into
English

The Comte de Tressan translated the
p 48words capo basso low headland in a
passage from Ariosto by Cap de Capo
Basso on account of which translation
the wits insisted upon calling him Comte
de Capo Basso

Robert Hall mentions a comical stumble
made by one of the translators of Plato
who construed through the Latin and not
direct from the Greek In the Latin
version _hirundo_ stood as _hirudo_ and the
translator overlooking the mark of
contraction declared to the astonished world
on the authority of Plato that the _horse
leech_ instead of the swallow was the harbinger
of spring Hoole the translator of
Tasso and Ariosto was as confused in his
natural history when he rendered I
colubri Viscontei or _Viscontian snakes_
the crest of the Visconti family as the
Calabrian Viscounts

As strange as this is the Frenchmans
notion of the presence of guns in the
canons seats LArcheveque de Cantorbery
avait fait placer des _canons_ dans
les stalles de la cathedrale He quite
overlooked the word _chanoines_ which he
should have used This use of a word
p 49similarly spelt is a constant source of
trouble to the translator for instance
a French translator of Scotts _Bride of
Lammermuir_ left the first word of the
title untranslated with the result that he
made it the Bridle of Lammermuir La
Bride de Lammermuir

Thevenot in his travels refers to the
fables of _Damne et Calilve_ meaning the
_Hitopodesa_ or Pilpays Fables His
translator calls them the fables of the damned
Calilve This is on a par with De
Quinceys specimen of a French Abbes
Greek Having to paraphrase the Greek
words gr Hrodotos kai iaxwn Herodotus
even while Ionicizing the Frenchman
rendered them Herodote et aussi Jazon
thus creating a new author one Jazon
In the _Present State of Peru_ a compilation
from the _Mercurio Peruano_ P Geronymo
Roman de la Higuera is transformed into
Father Geronymo a Romance of La
Higuera

In Robertsons _History of Scotland_ the
following passage is quoted from Melvilles
_Account of John Knox_ He was so active
and vigorous a preacher that he was like
p 50to ding the pulpit into blads and fly out
of it M Campenon the translator of
Robertson into French turns this into the
startling statement that he broke his pulpit
and leaped into the midst of his auditors
A good companion to this curious fact
may be found in the extraordinary trope
used by a translator of Busbequius who
says his misfortunes had reduced him to
the top of all miseries

We all know how Victor Hugo transformed
the Firth of Forth into the First of
the Fourth and then insisted that he was
right but this great novelist was in the
habit of soaring far above the realm of
fact and in a work he brought out as an
offering to the memory of Shakespeare he
showed that his imagination carried him
far away from historical facts The author
complains in this book that the muse of
history cares more for the rulers than for
the ruled and telling only what is pleasant
ignores the truth when it is unpalatable
to kings After an outburst of bombast
he says that no history of England tells us
that Charles II murdered his brother the
Duke of Gloucester We should be surp 51prised
if any did do so as that young man
died of smallpox Hugo being totally
ignorant of English history seems to have
confused the son of Charles I with an
earlier Duke of Gloucester Richard III
and turned the assassin into the victim
After these blunders Dr Balys mention
of the cannibals of _Nova Scotia_ instead
of _New Caledonia_ in his translation of
Mullers _Elements of Physiology_ seems
tame

One snare that translators are constantly
falling into is the use of English words
which are like the foreign ones but
nevertheless are not equivalent terms and
translations that have taken their place
in literature often suffer from this cause
thus Ciceros _Offices_ should have been
translated _Duties_ and Marmontel never
intended to write what we understand by
_Moral Tales_ but rather tales of manners
or of fashionable life The translators of
Calmets _Dictionary of the Bible_ render the
French ancien ancient and write of Mr
Huet the ancient Bishop of Avranch
Theodore Parker in translating a work by
De Wette makes the blunder of conp 52verting
the German word _Walsch_ a
foreigner in the book an equivalent for
Italian into _Welsh_

Some men translate works in order to
learn a language during the process and
they necessarily make blunders It must
have been one of these ignoramuses who
translated _tellurische magnetismus_
terrestrial magnetism as the magnetical qualities
of Tellurium and by his blunder caused
an eminent chemist to test tellurium in
order to find these magnetical qualities
There was more excuse for the French
translator of one of Sir Walter Scotts
novels who rendered a welsh rabbit or
rarebit as it is sometimes spelt into _un
lapin du pays de Galles_ Walpole states
that the Duchess of Bolton used to divert
George I by affecting to make blunders
and once when she had been to see Cibbers
play of _Loves Last Shift_ she called it _La
derniere chemise de lamour_ A like
translation of Congreves _Mourning Bride_ is
given in good faith in the first edition of
Peignots _Manuel du Bibliophile_ 1800
where it is described as _LEpouse de
Matin_ and the translation which Walpole
p 53attributes to the Duchess of Bolton the
French say was made by a Frenchman
named La Place

The title of the old farce _Hit or Miss_
was turned into _Frappe ou Mademoiselle_
and the _Independent Whig_ into _La
Perruque Independante_

In a late number of the _Literary
World_ the editor after alluding to the
French translator of Sir Walter Scott
who turned a sticket minister into
le ministre assassine gives from the
_Bibliotheque Universelle_ the extraordinary
translation of the title of Mr Barries
comedy _Walker London_ as _Londres qui
se promene_

Old translators have played such tricks
with proper names as to make them often
unintelligible thus we find La Rochefoucauld
figuring as Ruchfucove and in an
old treatise on the mystery of Freemasonry
by John Leland Pythagoras is described
as Peter Gower the Grecian This of
course is an Anglicisation of the French
Pythagore pronounced like Peter Gore
Our versions of Eastern names are so
different from the originals that when the
p 54two are placed together there appears
to be no likeness between them and the
different positions which they take up in
the alphabet cause the bibliographer an
infinity of trouble Thus the original of
Xerxes is Khshayarsha the revered king
and Averrhoes is Ibn Roshd son of
Roshd The latters full name is Abul
Walid Mohammed ben Ahmed ben Mohammed
Artaxerxes is in old Persian
Artakhshatra or the Fire Protector and
Darius means the Possessor Although
all these namesXerxes Artaxerxes and
Dariushave a royal significance they
were personal names and not titles like
Pharaoh

It is often difficult to believe that
translators can have taken the trouble to read
their own work or they surely would not
let pass some of the blunders we meet
with In a translation of Lamartines
_Girondins_ some courtly people are
described as figuring under the vaults of
the Tuileries instead of beneath the arched
galleries _sous ses voutes_ This however
is nothing to a blunder to be found
in the _Secret Memoirs of the Court of
p 55Louis XIV and of the Regency_ 1824
The following passage from the original
work Deux en sont morts et on dit
publiquement quils ont ete empoisonnes is
rendered in the English translation to the
confusion of common sense as Two of
them died with her and said publicly that
they had been poisoned

This is not unlike the bull of the young
soldier who writing home in praise of the
Indian climate said But a lot of young
fellows come out here and they drink
and they eat and they eat and they drink
and they die and then they write home
to their friends saying it was the climate
that did it

Some authors have found that there is
peril in too free a translation thus Dotet
was condemned on Feb 14th 1543 for
translating a passage in Platos Dialogues
as After death you will be nothing _at
all_ Surely he who translated _Dieu defend
ladultere_ as _God defends adultery_ more
justly deserved punishment Guthrie
the geographical writer who translated
a French book of travels unfortunately
mistook _neuvieme_ ninth for _neuvelle_ or
p 56_neuve_ and therefore made an allusion to
the twentysixth day of the new moon

Moore quotes in his _Diary_ Dec
30th 1818 a most amusing blunder of
a translator who knew nothing of the
technical name for a breakwater He
translated the line in Goldsmiths _Deserted
Village_

 As ocean sweeps the labourd mole away

into

 Comme la mer detruit les travaux de la taupe


DIsraeli records two comical translations
from English into French Ainsi
douleur vaten for _woe begone_ is almost
too good and the man who mistook the
expression the officer was broke as
meaning broke on a wheel and translated
it by _roue_ made a very serious matter of
what was possibly but a small fault

In the translation of _The Conscript_ by
ErckmannChatrian the old botcher is
turned into the old butcher

Sometimes in attempting to correct a
supposed blunder of another we fall into
p 57a very real one of our own Thus a few
years ago before we knew so much about
folklore as we do now we should very
probably have pointed out that Cinderellas
glass slipper owed its existence to a
misprint Fur was formerly so rare and so
highly prized that its use was restricted
by sumptuary laws to kings princes and
persons holding honourable offices In
these laws sable is called vair and it has
been asserted that Perrault marked the
dignity conferred upon Cinderella by the
fairys gift of a slipper of vair a privilege
confined to the highest rank of princesses
It is further stated that by an error of the
printer _vair_ was changed into _verre_ Now
however we find in the various versions
which have been collected of this favourite
tale that however much the incidents may
differ the slipper is almost invariably made
of some rigid material and in the earliest
forms the unkind sisters cut their feet to
make them fit the slipper This unpleasant
incident was omitted by Perrault but he
kept the rigid material and made the glass
slipper famous

The Revisers of the Old Testament
p 58translation have shown us that the famous
verse in Job Oh that mine adversary
had written a book is wrong but it
will never drop out of our language
and literature The Revised Version is
certainly much more in accordance with
our ideas of the time when the book was
written a period when authors could not
have been very common

 Oh that I had one to hear me
 Lo here is my signature let the Almighty answer me
 And that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written
 Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder
 I would bind it unto me as a crown


Silk Buckingham drew attention to the
fact that some translations of the Bible
had been undertaken by persons ignorant
of the idioms of the language into which
they were translating and he gave an
instance from an Arabic translation where
the text Judge not that ye be not
judged was rendered Be not just to
others lest others should be just to
you

The French have tried ingeniously to
p 59explain the difficulty contained in _St
Matthew_ xix 24 It is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
of God by affirming that the translators
mistook the supposed word gr kamilos a rope
for gr kamhlos a camel

The humours of translation are numerous
but perhaps the most eccentric
example is to be found in Stanyhursts
rendering of _Virgil_ published in 1583
It is full of cant words and reads like
the work of a madman This is a fair
specimen of the work

 Theese thre were upbotching not shapte but partlye wel onward
 A clapping fierbolt such as oft with rownce robelhobble
 Jove to the ground clattreth but yeet not finished holye


M Guyot translating some Latin epigrams
under the title of _Fleurs Morales et
Epigrammatiques_ uses the singular forms
Monsieur Zoile and Mademoiselle Lycoris
The same author when translating the
letters of Cicero 1666 turns Pomponius
into M de Pomponne
p 60

Pitts friend Pepper Arden Master of
the Rolls Lord Chief Justice of the
Common Pleas and Lord Alvanley was
rather hottempered and his name was
considered somewhat appropriate but to
make it still more so his friends translated
it into Mons Poivre Ardent

This reminds one of the Frenchman who
toasted Dr Johnson not as Mr Rambler
but as Mr Vagabond

Tom Moore notices some amusing mis
translations in his _Diary_ Major
Cartwright who was called the Father of
Reform although a wit suggested that
Mother of Reform would have been a
more appropriate title supposed that
the _Brevia Parliamentaria_ of Prynne
stood for short parliaments Lord
Lansdowne told Moore that he was with
Lord Holland when the letter containing
this precious bit of erudition arrived
Another story of Lord Lansdownes is
equally good His French servant
announced Dr Mansell the Master of
Trinity when he called as Maitre des
Ceremonies de la Trinite

Moore also relates that an account
p 61having appeared in the London papers
of a row at the Stock Exchange where
some strangers were hustled it appeared
in the Paris papers in this form Mons
Stock Exchange etait echauffe etc

There is something to be said in favour
of the humorous translation of _Magna est
veritas et prevalabit_Great is truth
it will prevail a bit for it is probably
truer than the original He who construed
Caesars mode of passing into Gaul
_summa diligentia_ on the top of the
diligence must have been of an imaginative
turn of mind Probably the time will
soon come when this will need explanation
for a public will arise which knows
not the dilatory diligence

The translator of _Inter Calicem
supremaque labra_ as Betwixt Dover and
Calais gave as his reason that Dover was
_Angliae suprema labra_

Although not a blunder nor apparently
a joke we may conclude this chapter with
a reference to Shakespeares remarkable
translation of _Finis Coronat opus_ Helena
remarks in _Alls well that Ends well_ act
iv sc 4
p 62
Alls well that ends well still _the fines the crown_


In the _Second Part of King Henry VI_
act v sc 2 old Lord Clifford just before
he dies is made to use the French translation
of the proverb

 La fin couronne les oeuvres

In the first Folio we read

 La fin corrone les eumenes



CHAPTER IV

BIBLIOGRAPEIICAL BLUNDERS

THERE is no class that requires
to be dealt with more leniently
than do bibliographers for pitfalls
are before and behind them It is
impossible for any one man to see all the
books he describes in a general bibliography
and in consequence of the necessity
of trusting to secondhand information
he is often led imperceptibly into gross
error Watts _Bibliotheca Britannica_ is a
most useful and valuable work but as
may be expected from so comprehensive
a compilation many mistakes have crept
into it for instance under the head of
Philip Beroaldus we find the following
title of a work A short view of the
Persian Monarchy published at the end
of Daniels Works The mystery of the
last part of the title is cleared up when we
p 64find that it should properly be read _and
of Daniels Weekes_ it being a work on
prophecy The librarian of the old
Marylebone Institution knowing as little of
Latin as the monk did of Hebrew when
he described a book as having the beginning
where the end should be catalogued
an edition of AEsops Fables as AEsopiarums
Phoedri Fabulorum

Two blunders that a bibliographer is
very apt to fall into are the rolling of
different authors of the same name into
one and the creation of an author who
never existed The first kind we may
illustrate by mentioning the dismay of the
worthy Bishop Jebb when he found himself
identified in Watts _Bibliotheca_ with
his uncle the Unitarian writer Of the
second kind we might point out the
names of men whose lives have been
written and yet who never existed In
the _Zoological Biography_ of Agassiz
published by the Ray Society there is an
imaginary author by name J K Broch
whose work _Entomologische Briefe_ was
published in 1823 This pamphlet is
really anonymous and was written by
p 65one who signed himself J K Broch is
merely an explanation in the catalogue
from which the entry was taken that it
was a _brochure_ Moreri created an author
whom he styled Dorus Basilicus out of
the title of James Is gr Dwron basilikon
and Bishop Walton supposed the title of
the great Arabic Dictionary the _Kamoos_
or Ocean to be the name of an author
whom he quotes as Camus In the
article on Stenography in Reess Cyclopaedia
there are two most amusing blunders
John Nicolai published a _Treatise on the
Signs of the Ancients_ at the beginning of
the last century and the writer of the
article having seen it stated that a certain
fact was to be found in Nicolai jumped
to the conclusion that it was the name of
a place and wrote It was at Nicolai
that this method of writing was first
introduced to the Greeks by Xenophon
himself Tn another part of the same
article the oldest method of shorthand
extant entitled Ars Scribendi Characteris
is said to have been printed about
the year 1412that is long before printing
was invented In the _Biographie Univerp 66selle_
there is a life of one Nicholas Donis
by Baron Walckenaer which is a blundering
alteration of the real name of a
Benedictine monk called Dominus Nicholas
This however is not the only time that
a title has been taken for a name An
eminent bookseller is said to have
received a letter signed George Winton
proposing a life of Pitt but as he did not
know the name he paid no attention to
the letter and was much astonished when
he was afterwards told that his
correspondent was no less a person than
George Pretyman Tomline Bishop of
Winchester This is akin to the mistake
of the Scotch doctor attending on the
Princess Charlotte during her illness who
said that ane Jean Saroom had been
continually calling but not knowing the
fellow he had taken no notice of him
Thus the Bishop of Salisbury was sent
away by one totally ignorant of his
dignity A similar blunder was made by a
bibliographer for in Hottens _Handbook
to the Topography and Family History of
England and Wales_ will be found an entry
of an Assize Sermon by Bishop Wigorn
p 67in the Cathedral at Worcester 1690
This was really Bishop Stillingfleet There
is a reverse case of a catalogue made by
a worthy bookseller of the name of William
London which was long supposed to be
the work of Dr William Juxon the Bishop
of London at the time of publication
The entry in the _Biographie Moderne_ of
Brigham _le jeune_ ou Brigham Young
furnishes a fine instance of a writer
succumbing to the everpresent temptation
to be too clever by half A somewhat
similar blunder is that of the late Mr
Dircks The first reprint of the Marquis
of Worcesters _Century of Inventions_ was
issued by Thomas Payne the highly
respected bookseller of the Mews Gate in
1746 but in _Worcesteriana_ 1866 Mr
Dircks positively asserts that the notorious
Tom Paine was the publisher of it thus
ignoring the different spelling of the two
names

In a French book on the invention of
printing the sentence Le berceau de
limprimerie was misread by a German
who turned Le Berceau into a man
DIsraeli tells us that _Mantissa_ the title
p 68of the Appendix to Johnstones _History
of Plants_ was taken for the name of an
author by DAquin the French kings
physician The author of the _Curiosities
of Literature_ also relates that an Italian
misread the description _Enrichi de deux
listes_ on the titlepage of a French book
of travels and taking it for the authors
name alluded to the opinions of
Mons Enrichi De Deux Listes but
really this seems almost too good to be
true

If we searched bibliographical literature
we should find a fair crop of authors who
never existed for when once a blunder
of this kind is set going it seems to bear
a charmed life Mr Daydon Jackson
mentions some amusing instances of
imaginary authors made out of titlepages
in his _Guide to the Literature of Botany_
An anonymous work of A Massalongo
entitled _Graduale Passagio delle Crittogame
alle Fanerogame_ 1876 has been entered
in a German bibliography as written by
G Passagio In an English list Kelaarts
_Flora Calpensis Reminiscences of Gibraltar_
1846 appears as the work of a lady
p 69Christian name Flora _surname_ Calpensis
In 1837 a _BotanicalLexicon_ was published
by an author who described himself as
The Rev Patrick Keith Clerk FLS
This somewhat pedantic form deceived a
foreign cataloguer who took Clerk for the
surname and contracted Patrick Keith
into the initials PK More inexcusable
was the blunder of an American who in
describing J E H Gordons work on
_Electricity_ changed the authors degree
into the initials of a collaborator one
Cantab The joint authors were stated
to be J E H Gordon and B A Cantab

A very amusing but a quite excusable
error was made by Allibone in his
_Dictionary of English Literature_ under
the heading of Isaac DIsraeli He
notices new editions of that authors
works revised by the Right Hon the
Chancellor of the Exchequer of course
Isaacs son Benjamin afterwards Prime
Minister and Earl of Beaconsfield but
unfortunately there were two Chancellors
in 1858 and Allibone chooses the wrong
one printing as useful information to the
reader that the reviser was Sir George
p 70Cornewall Lewis An instance of the
danger of inconsiderate explanation will
be found in a little book by a German
lady Fanny Lewald entitled _England
and Schottland_ The authoress when in
London visited the theatre in order to
see a play founded on Coopers novel
_The Wept of Wishton Wish_ and being
unable to understand the title she calls
it the Will of the Whiston Wisp which
she tells us means an _ignis fatuus_

A writer in a German paper was led
into an amusing blunder by an English
review a few years ago The reviewer
having occasion to draw a distinction
between George and Robert Cruikshank
spoke of the former as the real Simon
Pure The German not understanding
the allusion gravely told his readers that
George Cruikshank was a pseudonym
the authors real name being Simon Pure
This seems almost too good to be equalled
but a countryman of our own has blundered
nearly as grossly William Taylor
in his _Historic Survey of German Poetry_
1830 prints the following absurd
statement Godfred of Berlichingen is one
p 71of the earliest imitations of the Shakspeare
tragedy which the German school has
produced It was admirably translated into
English in 1799 at Edinburg by _William_
Scott advocate no doubt the same person
who under the poetical but assumed name
of _Walter_ has since become the most
extensively popular of the British writers
The cause of this mistake we cannot explain
but the reason for it is to be found
in the fact which has lately been announced
that a few copies of the translation with
the misprint of William for Walter in the
title were issued before the error was
discovered

Jacob Boehm the theosophist wrote
some Reflections on a theological treatise
by one Isaiah Stiefel6 the title of which
puzzled one of his modern French
biographers The word Stiefel in German
means a boot and the Frenchman therefore
gave the title of Boehms tract as
Reflexions sur les Bottes dIsaie



6 Bedencken uber Esaiae Stiefels Buchlein
von dreyerley Zustandt des Menschen unnd dessen
newen Geburt 1639



It is scarcely fair to make capital out
p 72of the blunders of booksellers catalogues
which are often printed in a great hurry
and cannot possibly possess the advantage
of correction which a book does But
one or two examples may be given without
any censure being intended on the
booksellers

In a French catalogue the works of
the famous philosopher Robert Boyle
appeared under the following singular
French form BOY le Chymista scepticus
vel dubia et paradoxa chymicophysica c

Mr Tul Ciceros Epistles looks
strange but the mistake is but small
The very natural blunder respecting the
title of Shelleys _Prometheus Unbound_
actually did occur and what is more it
was expected by Theodore Hook This is
an accurate copy of the description in the
catalogue of a year or two back

Shelleys Prometheus _Unbound_

 another copy _in whole calf_
and these are Hooks lines

 Shelley styles his new poem Prometheus Unbound
 And tis like to remain so while time circles round
 p 73For surely an age would be spent in the finding
 A reader so weak as _to pay for the binding_


When books are classified in a catalogue
the compiler must be peculiarly on his
guard if he has the titles only and not
the books before him Sometimes instances
of incorrect classification show
gross ignorance as in the instance quoted
in the _Athenaeum_ lately Here we have
a crop of blunders _Title_ Commentarii
De Bello Gallico in usum Scholarum
Liber Tirbius _Author_ Mr C J
Caesoris _Subject_ Religion Still better
is the auctioneers entry of P V Maronis
_The Opera_ Authors however are usually
so fond of fanciful earcatching titles that
every excuse must be made for the cataloguer
who mistakes their meaning and
takes them in their literal signification
Who can reprove too severely the classifier
who placed Swinburnes _Under the
Microscope_ in his class of _Optical
Instruments_ or treated Ruskins _Notes on the
Construction of Sheetfolds_ as a work on
agricultural appliances A late instance
of an amusing misclassification is reported
from Germany In the _Orientalische
p 74Bibliographie_ Mr Rider Haggards
wonderful story _King Solomons Mines_ is
entered as a contribution to
Alttestamentliche Litteratur

The elaborate work by Careme _Le
Patissier Pittoresque_ 1842 which
contains designs for confectioners deceived
the bookseller from its plates of pavilions
temples etc into supposing it to be a
book on architecture and he accordingly
placed it under that heading in his
catalogue

Mr Daydon Jackson gives several
instances of false classification in his _Guide
to the Literature of Botany_ and remarks
that some authors contrive titles seemingly
of set purpose to entrap the unwary He
instances a fine example in the case of
Bishop Alexander Ewings _Feamainn
Earraghaidhiell Argyllshire Seaweeds_
Glasgow 1872 8vo To enhance the
delusion the coloured wrapper is
ornamented with some of the common marine
algae but the inside of the volume
consists solely of pastoral addresses Another
example will be found in _Flowers from
the South from the Hortus Siccus of an
p 75Old Collector_ By W H Hyett FRS
Instead of a popular work on the
Mediterranean flora by a scientific man as
might reasonably be expected this is a
volume of translations from the Italian
and Latin poets It is scarcely fair to
blame the compiler of the _Bibliotheca
HistorioNaturalis_ for having ranked
both these works among scientific treatises
The English cataloguer who treated as a
botanical book Dr Garnetts selection
from Coventry Patmores poems entitled
_Florilegium Amantis_ could claim less
excuse for his blunder than the German
had These misleading titles are no new
invention and the great bibliographer
Haller was deceived into including the
title of James Howells _Dendrologia or
Dodonas Grove_ 1640 in his _Bibliotheca
Botanica_ Professor Otis H Robinson
contributed a very interesting paper on the
Titles of Books to the _Special Report
on Public Libraries in the United States of
America_ 1876 in which he deals very
fully with this difficulty of misleading titles
and some of his preliminary remarks are
very much to the point He writes
p 76

No act of a mans life requires
more practical common sense than the
naming of his book If he would make
a grocers sign or an invoice of a cellar
of goods or a city directory he uses no
metaphors his pen does not hesitate for
the plainest word He must make himself
understood by common men But
if he makes a book the case is different
It must have the charm of a pleasing
title If there is nothing new within the
back at least must be novel and taking
He tortures his imagination for something
which will predispose the reader in its
favour Mr Parker writes a series of
biographical sketches and calls it _Morning
Stars of the New World_ Somebody prepares
seven religious essays binds them
up in a book and calls it _Seven Stormy
Sundays_ Mr H T Tuckerman makes
a book of essays on various subjects and
calls it _The Optimist_ and then devotes
several pages of preface to an argument
lexicon in hand proving that the
applicability of the term optimist is obvious
An editor at intervals of leisure indulges
his true poetic taste for the pleasure of his
p 77friends or the entertainment of an
occasional audience Then his book appears
entitled not _Miscellaneous Poems_ but
_Asleep in the Sanctum_ by A A Hopkins
Sometimes not satisfied with one enigma
another is added Here we have _The
Great Iron Wheel or Republicanism
Backwards and Christianity Reversed_ by J R
Graves These titles are neither new nor
scarce nor limited to any particular class
of books Every case almost every shelf
in every library contain such They are as
old as the art of bookmaking Davids
lamentation over Saul and Jonathan was
called _The Bow_ A single word in the
poem probably suggested the name Three
of the orations of AEschines were styled _The
Graces_ and his letters _The Muses_

The list of bibliographical blunders
might be indefinitely extended but the
subject is somewhat technical and the
above few instances will give a sufficient
indication of the pitfalls which lie in the
way of the bibliographera worker who
needs universal knowledge if he is to
wend his way safely through the snares
in his path



CHAPTER V

LISTS OF ERRATA

THE errata of the early printed
books are not numerous and
this fact is easily accounted for
when we recollect that these books were
superintended in their passage through
the press by scholars such as the Alduses
Andreas Bishop of Aleria Campanus
Perottus the Stephenses and others
It is said that the first book with a printed
errata is the edition of _Juvenal_ with notes
of Merula printed by Gabriel Pierre at
Venice in 1478 previously the mistakes
had been corrected by the pen One of
the longest lists of errata on record which
occupies fifteen folio pages is in the
edition of the works of Picus of Mirandula
printed by Knoblauch at Strasburg
in 1507 A worse case of blundering will
be found in a little book of only one
p 79hundred and seventytwo pages entitled
_Missae ac Missalis Anatomia_ 1561
which contains fifteen pages of errata
The author feeling that such a gross case
of blundering required some excuse or
explanation accounted for the misprints
by asserting that the devil drenched
the manuscript in the kennel making it
almost illegible and then obliged the
printer to misread it We may be allowed
to believe that the fiend who did all the
mischief was the printers devil

Cardinal Bellarmin tried hard to get
his works printed correctly but without
success and in 1608 he was forced to
publish at Ingolstadt a volume entitled
_Recognitio librorum omnium Roberti
Belarmini_ in which he printed eightyeight
pages of errata of his Controversies

Edward Leigh in his thin folio volume
entitled _On Religion and Learning_ 1656
was forced to add two closely printed
leaves of errata

Sometimes apparent blunders have been
intentionally made thus to escape the
decree of the Inquisition that the words
fatum and fata should not be used in
p 80any work a certain author printed _facta_
in his book and added in the errata _for_
facta _read_ fata

In dealing with our own older literature
we find a considerable difference in degree
of typographical correctness thus the old
plays of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries are often marvels of inaccuracy
and while books of the same date are
usually supplied with tables of errata
plays were issued without any such helps
to correction This to some extent is to
be accounted for by the fact that many of
these plays were surreptitious publications
or at all events printed in a hurry without
care The late Mr Halliwell Phillipps in
his curious privately printed volume _A
Dictionary of Misprints_ 1887 writes
Such tests were really a thousandfold
more necessary in editions of plays but
they are practically nonexistent in the
latter the brief one which is prefixed
to Dekkers _SatiroMastix_ 1602 being
nearly the only example that is to be
found in any that appeared during the
literary career of the great dramatist

In other branches of literature it is
p 81evident that some care was taken to escape
misprints either by the correction of the
printers reader or of the author Some
of the excuses made for misprints in our
old books are very amusing In a little
English book of twentysix leaves printed
at Douay in 1582 and entitled _A true
reporte of the death and martyrdome of
M Campion Jesuite and Preiste and M
Sherwin and M Bryan Preistes at Tiborne
the first of December_ 1581 is this notice
at the end

Good reader pardon all faultes escaped
in the printing and beare with the
woorkmanship of a strainger

Many of Nicholas Bretons tracts were
issued surreptitiously and he protested
that many pieces which he had never
written were falsely ascribed to him _The
Bower of Delights_ was published without
the authors sanction and the printer
or publisher Richard Jones made the
following address to the Gentlemen
Readers on the blunders which had
been made in the book

Pardon mee good Gentlemen of my
presumption  protect me I pray youp 82
against those Cavellers and findfaults that
never like of any thing that they see
printed though it be never so well
compiled And where you happen to find
fault impute it to bee committed by the
Printers negligence then otherwise by
any ignorance in the author and
especially in A 3 about the middest of
the page for LIME OR LEAD I pray you
read LINE OR LEAD So shall your poore
Printer haue just cause hereafter to be
more carefull and acknowledge himselfe
most bounden at all times to do your
service to the utmost of his power
 Yours R J PRINTER


A little scientific book entitled _The
Making and use of the Geometricall Instrument
called a Sector    by Thomas Hood_
1598 has a list of errata headed _Faultes
escaped_ with this note of the author
or printer

Gentle reader I pray you excuse
these faults because I finde by experience
that it is an harder matter to
print these mathematicall books trew
then bookes of other discourse
p 83

Arthur Hoptons _Baculum Geodaeticum
sive Viaticum or the Geodeticall Staffe_
1610 contains the following quaint lines
at the head of the list of errata

 The Printer to the Reader
 For errours past or faults that scaped be
 Let this collection give content to thee
 A worke of art the grounds to us unknowne
 May cause us erre thoughe all our skill be showne
 When points and letters doe containe the sence
 The wise may halt yet doe no great offence
 Then pardon here such faults that do befall
 The next edition makes amends for all


Thomas Heywood the voluminous dramatist
added to his _Apology for Actors_
1612 an interesting address to the
printer of his tract which besides drawing
attention to the printers dislike of his
errors being called attention to in a table
of errata is singularly valuable for its
reference to Shakespeares annoyance at
Jaggards treatment of him by attributing
to his pen Heywoods poems from _Great
Britains Troy_

 To my approved good Friend
 MR NICHOLAS OKES
 The infinite faults escaped in myp 84
booke of _Britaines Troy_ by the negligence
of the printer as the misquotations
mistaking the sillables misplacing halfe lines
coining of strange and never heard of
words these being without number when
I would have taken a particular account
of the _errata_ the printer answered me hee
would not publish his owne disworkemanship
but rather let his owne fault lye
upon the necke of the author And being
fearefull that others of his quality had
beene of the same nature and condition
and finding you on the contrary so
carefull and industrious so serious and
laborious to doe the author all the rights
of the presse I could not choose but
gratulate your honest indeavours with
this short remembrance Here likewise
I must necessarily insert a manifest injury
done me in that worke by taking the
two epistles of Paris to Helen and Helen
to Paris and printing them in a lesse
volume under the name of another which
may put the world in opinion I might
steale them from him and hee to doe
himselfe right hath since published them
in his owne name but as I must
acp 85knowledge my lines not worthy his
patronage under whom he hath publisht
them so the author I know much offended
with M Jaggard that altogether unknowne
to him presumed to make so bold with
his name These and the like dishonesties
I knowe you to bee cleere of and I could
wish but to bee the happy author of so
worthy a worke as I could willingly commit
to your care and workmanship
 Yours ever THOMAS HEYWOOD


In the eighteenth century printers and
authors had become hardened in their
sins and seldom made excuses for the
errors of the press but in the seventeenth
century explanations were frequent

Silvanus Morgan in his _Horologiographia
Optica Dialling Universall and
Particular Speculative and Practicall
London_ 1652 comes before his readers
with these remarks on the errata


Reader I having writ this some years
since while I was a childe in Art and by
this appear to be little more for want of
a review hath these faults which I desire
thee to mend with thy pen and if there
p 86be any errour in art as in chap 17
which is only true at the time of the
Equinoctiall take that for an oversight
and where thou findest equilibra read
equilibrio and in the dedication in some
copies read Robert Bateman for Thomas
and side for signe and know that _Optima
prima cadunt pessimus aeve manent_

The list of errata in Joseph Glanvills
_Essays on several important subjects in
Philosophy and Religion_ 1676 is prefixed
by this note

The Reader is desired to take notice
of the following Errours of the Press some
of which are so near in sound to the
words of the author that they may easily
be mistaken for his

The next two books to be mentioned
were published in the same year1679
The noble author referred to in the first is
that Roger Palmer who had the dishonour
of being the husband of Charles IIs
notorious mistress the Countess of
Castlemaine Fortunately for the Earl she no
longer bore his name as she was created
Duchess of Cleveland in 1670 Professor
De Morgan was inclined to doubt Lord
p 87Castlemaines authorship but the following
remarks by Joseph Moxon seem to prove
that the peer did produce a rough draft of
some kind

Postscript concerning the Erratas and
the Geographical part of this Globe
prefixed to _The English Globe_    by
the Earl of Castlemaine

The Erratas of the Press being many
I shall not set them down in a distinct
Catalogue as usually least the sight of them
should more displease than the particulars
advantage especially since they are not so
material or intricate but that any man may
I hope easily mend them in the reading
I confess I have bin in a manner the occasion
of them by taking from the noble
author a very foul copy when he desird
me to stay till a fair one were written over
so that truly tis no wonder if workmen
should in these cases not only sometimes
leave out but adde also by taking one line
for another or not observing with exactness
what words have bin wholly obliterated
or dasht out

John Playford the music publisher
and author makes some remarks on the
p 88subject of misprints in the preface to
his _Vade Mecum or the Necessary Companion_
1679 which are worth quotation
here

My profession obliging me to be
conversant with mathematical Books the
printing whereof and musick has been
my chiefest employment I have observd
two things many times the cause why
Books of this nature appear abroad not
so correct as they should be either 1
Because they are too much hastened from
the Press and not time enough allowed
for the strict and deliberate examination
of them which in all books ought to be
done especially in these for as much as
one false figure in a Mathematical book
may prove a greater fault than a whole
word mistake in books of another kind
Or 2 Because Persons take Tables upon
trust without trying them and with them
transcribe their errors if not increase
them Both these I have carefully avoided
so that I have reason to believe and think
I may say it without vanity there never
was Tables more exactly printed than in
this Book especially those for money and
p 89annuities for not trusting to my first
calculation of them I new calculated every
Table when it was in print by the first
printed sheet and when I had so done
I strictly compared it with my first calculation

De Morgan registers the nineteenth
edition of this book dated 1756 in his
_Arithmetical Books_ and he did not apparently
know that it was originally published
so early as 1679

In Mortons _Natural History of
Northamptonshire_ 1712 is a list headed Some
Errata of the press to be corrected and
at the end of the list is the following
amusing note There is no cut of the
Hen of the lesser Pyd Brambling in Tab
13 tho tis referred to in p 423 which
omission was owing to an accident and is
really not very material the hen of that
bird differing but little from the cock
which is represented in that Table under
fig 3

There is a very prevalent notion that
authors did not correct the proofs of their
books in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries but there is sufficient evidence
p 90that this is altogether a mistake Professor
De Morgan with his usual sagacity alludes
to this point in his _Arithmetical Books_
1847 A great many circumstances induce
me to think that the general fashion
of correcting the press by the author came
in with the seventeenth century or
thereabouts And he instances this note on
the titlepage of Richard Witts _Arithmetical
Questions_ 1613 Examined also
and corrected at the Presse by the author
himselfe

The late Dr Brinsley Nicholson raised
this question in _Notes and Queries_ in 1889
and by his research it is possible to
antedate the practice by nearly forty years
For several of the following quotations I
am indebted to that invaluable periodical
In Scots _HopGarden_ 1574 we find the
following excuse

Forasmuch as M Scot could not
be present at the printing of this his
booke whereby I might have used his
advice in the correction of the same and
especiallie of the Figures and Portratures
conteyned therein whereof he
delivered unto me such notes as I
p 91being unskilfull in the matter could
not so thoroughly conceyve nor so
perfectly expresse as    the authour
or you

In _The Droomme of Doomes Day_ By
George Gascoigne 1576 is


An Aduertisement of the Prynter to the Reader


Understand gentle Reader that whiles
this worke was in the presse it pleased
God to visit the translatour thereof with
sicknesse So that being unable himselfe
to attend the dayly proofes he apoynted
a seruaunt of his to ouersee the same
Who being not so well acquainted with
the matter as his maister was there haue
passed some faultes much contrary unto
both our meanings and desires The which
I have therefore collected into this Table
Desiring every Reader that wyll vouchsafe
to peruse this booke that he will firste
correct those faultes and then judge accordingly

A particularly interesting note on this
point precedes the list of errata in Stanyhursts
Translation of Virgils _AEneid_ 1582
p 92which was printed at Leyden Mr F C
Birkbeck Terry who pointed this out in
_Notes and Queries_ quoted from Arbers
reprint p 157

John Pates Printer to thee Corteous
Reader I am too craue thy pacience and
paynes good reader in bearing wyth such
faultes as haue escapte in printing and
in correcting as wel such as are layd downe
heere too thy view as all oother whereat
thou shalt hap too stumble in perusing
this treatise Thee nooueltye of imprinting
English in theese partes and thee absence
of the author from perusing soome proofes
could not choose but breede errours

Certainly Scot Gascoigne and Stanyhurst
did not correct the proofs but it
would not have been necessary to make
an excuse if the practice was not a pretty
general one among authors

Bishop Babingtons _Exposition of the
Lords Prayer_ 1588 contains an excuse
for the authors inability to correct the
press

If thou findest any other faultes either
in words or distinctions troubling a perfect
sence Gentle Reader helpe them by thine
p 93owne judgement and excuse the presse by
the Authors absence who best was acquainted
to reade his owne hande

In the Bobleian Library is preserved
the printers copy of Book V of Hookers
_Ecclesiastical Polity_ 1597 with Whitgifts
signature and corrections in Hookers
handwriting On one of the pages is the
following note by the printer

Good Mr Hooker I pray you be so
good as to send us the next leaf that
followeth this for I know not by what
mischance this of ours is lost which
standeth uppon the finishing of the
book7

Another proof of the general practice
will be found in N Bretons _The Wit of
Wit_ 1599

What faultes are escaped in the printing

Author by other worke that let him from
attendance to the Presse non ha che non

At the end of Nashs dedication To
his Readers _Lenten Stuffe_ 1599 is this
p 94interesting statement Apply it for me
for I am called away to correct the faults
of the press that escaped in my absence
from the printing house

Richard Brathwaite when publishing
his _Strappado for the Divell_ 1615 made
an excuse for not having seen all the
proofs The whole note is well worthy
of reproduction

 Upon the Errata


Gentlemen _humanum est errare_ to
confirme which position this my booke
as many other are hath his share of
errors so as I run _ad praelum tanquam
ad praelium in typos quasi in scippos_ but
my comfort is if I be strappadoed by the
multiplicite of my errors it is but
answerable to my title so as I may seem to
diuine by my style what I was to indure
by the presse Yet know judicious disposed
gentlemen that the intricacie of the
copie and the absence of the author from
many important proofes were occasion of
these errors which defects if they bee
supplied by your generous convenience
and curtuous disposition I doe vowe to
p 95satisfie your affectionate care with a
more serious surueigh in my next
impression    For other errors as the
misplacing of commaes colons and
periods which as they are in euerie
page obvious so many times they invert
the sence I referre to your discretion
judicious gentlemen whose lenity may
sooner supply them then all my industry
can portray them

In _The Mastive or Young Whelpe of
the Olde Dogge Epigrams and Satyres
_1615 an anonymous work of Henry
Peacham we read

The faultes escaped in the Printing
or any other omission are to be excused
by reason of the authors absence from the
Presse who thereto should have given
more due instructions

Dr Brinsley Nicholson brought forward
two very interesting passages on the
correcting of proofs from old plays The
first which looks very like an allusion to
the custom is from the 1601 edition of
Ben Jonsons _Every Man in his Humour_
act ii sc 3 where Lorenzo junior
says My father had the proving of your
p 96copy some houre before I saw it The
second is from Fletchers _The Nice Valour_
1624 or 1625 act iv sc 1 Lapet
says to his servant the clown Goloshio
So bring me the last proof this is
corrected and Goloshio having gone
and returned the following ensues

 _Lap_ What says my Printer now
 _Clown_ Heres your last Proof Sir
 You shall have perfect Books now in a twinkling8


 82 _Notes and Queries_ 7th Series viii 253



The following address which contains
a curious excuse of Dr Daniel Featley for
not having corrected the proofs of his
book _The Romish Fisher Caught in his own
Net_ 1624 is very much to the point

I entreat the courteous reader to
understand that the greater part of the
book was printed in the time of the great
frost when by reason that the Thames
was shut up I could not conveniently
procure the proofs to be brought unto
mee before they were wrought off whereupon
it fell out that many very grosse
escapes passed the press and which was
p 97the worst fault of all the third part is left
unpaged

As a later example we may cite from
Sir Peter Leycesters _Historical Antiquities_
1673 where we find this note Reader
By reason of the authors absence several
faults have escaped the press those which
are the most material thou art desird to
amend and to pardon them all

Printed mistakes are usually considered
by the sufferers matters of somewhat
serious importance and we picture to
ourselves an author stalking up and down
his room and tearing his hair when
he first discovers them but Benserade
the French poet was able to make a joke
of the subject This is the _rondeau_ which
he placed at the end of his version of _Les
Metamorphoses dOvide_

 Pour moi parmi des fautes innombrables
 Je nen connais que deux considerables
 Et dont je fais ma declaration
 Cest lentreprise et lexecution
 A mon avis fautes irreparables
 Dans ce volume


According to the _Scaligerana_ Cardans
treatise _De Subtilitate_ printed by Vascosan
p 98in 1557 does not contain a single
misprint but on the whole it may be very
seriously doubted whether an immaculate
edition of any work ever issued from the
press The story is well known of the
serious attempt made by the celebrated
Glasgow printers Foulis to free their edition
of _Horace_ from any chance of error They
caused the proofsheets after revision to
be hung up at the gate of the University
with the offer of a reward to any one who
discovered a misprint In spite of all this
care there are according to Dibdin six
uncorrected errors in this edition

According to Isaac Disraeli the goal
of freedom from blunders was nearly
reached by Dom Joze Souza with the
assistance of Didot in 1817 when he
published his magnificent edition of _As
Lusiadas_ of Camoens However an
uncorrected error was discovered in some
copies occasioned by the misplacing of
one of the letters in the word _Lusitano_
A like case occurred a few years ago at an
eminent London printers A certain book
was about to be printed and instructions
were issued that special care was to be
p 99taken with the printing It was read over
by the chief reader and all seemed to
have gone well when a mistake was discovered
upon the titlepage

It may be mentioned here with respect
to tables of errata that they are frequently
neglected in subsequent books There are
many books in which the same blunders
have been repeated in various editions
although they had been pointed out in an
early issue



CHAPTER VI

MISPRINTS

OF all literary blunders misprints
are the most numerous and no
one who is conversant with the
inside of a printingoffice will be surprised
at this in fact he is more likely to be
struck with the freedom from error of the
innumerable productions issued from the
press than to be surprised at the blunders
which he may come across The possibilities
of error are endless and a frequent
cause is to be found in the final correction
when a line may easily get transposed
On this account many authors will prefer
to leave a trivial error such as a wrong
stop in a final revise rather than risk the
possibilities of blundering caused by the
unlocking of the type Of course a large
number of misprints are far from amusing
while a sense of fun will sometimes be
p 101obtained by a trifling transposition of
letters Authors must be on the alert for
misprints although ordinary misspellings
should not be left for them by the printers
reader but they are usually too intent on
the structure of their own sentences to
notice these misprints The curious point
is that a misprint which has passed through
proof and revise unnoticed by reader and
author will often be detected immediately
the perfected book is placed in the authors
hands The blunder which has hitherto
remained hidden appears to start out from
the page to the authors great disgust
One reason why misprints are overlooked
is that every word is a sort of pictorial
object to the eye We do not spell the
word but we guess what it is by the first
and last letters and its length so that a
wrong letter in the body of the word is
easily overlooked

It is an important help to the editor of
a corrupt text to know what misprints are
the most probable and for this purpose
the late Mr Halliwell Phillipps printed
for private circulation _A Dictionary of
Misprints found in printed books of the
p 102sixteenth and seventeenth centuries compiled
for the use of verbal critics and especially
for those who are engaged in editing the
works of Shakespeare and our other early
Dramatists_ 1887 In the note at the
end of this book Mr Phillipps writes
The readiest access to those evidences
will be found in the old errata and it will
be seen on an examination of the latter
that misprints are abundant in final and
initial letters in omissions in numerals
and in verbal transpositions but
unquestionably the most frequent in pronouns
articles conjunctions and prepositions
When we come to words outside the
four latter there is a large proportion of
examples that are either of rare occurrence
or unique Some of the blunders that are
recorded are sufficiently grotesque _eg
Ile starte thence poore for Ile starve their
poorehe formaketh what for the fire
maketh hot_ It must indeed be confessed
that the conjectural emendator if he
dispenses with the quasiauthority of
contemporary precedents has an all but
unlimited range for the exercise of his
ingenuity the unsettled spellings of our
p 103ancestors rendering almost any
emendation however extravagant a typographical
possibility A large number of their
misprints could only have been perpetrated
in the midst of the old orthographies
Under no other conditions could _ice_ have
been converted into _ye_ _air_ into _time_ _home_
into _honey_ _attain_ into _at any_ _sun_ into
_sinner_ _stone_ into _story_ _deem_ into _deny_
_dire_ into _dry_ the old spellings of the
italicised words being respectively yce
yee ayre tyme home honie attaine att
anie sunne sinner stone storie deeme
denie dire drie The form of the long _s_
should also be sometimes taken into
consideration for it could only have been
owing to its use that such a word as _some_
could have been misprinted _four niece_ for
_wife prefer_ for _preserve find_ for _fifth_ the
variant old spellings being foure neese
preferre

Among the instances of misprints given
in this Dictionary may be noticed the
following actions _for_ axioms agreement
_for_ argument alleyes _for_ allies aloud _for_
allowed banishd _for_ ravishd cancel _for_
cantel candle _for_ caudle culsedness
p 104_for_ ourselves eyesores _for_ oysters felicity
_for_ facility Hector _for_ nectar intending
_for_ indenting John _for_ Jehu Judges _for_
Indies scene _for_ seene sixteen _for_ sexton
and _for_ sixtyone tops _for_ toy Venus
_for_ Venice

In connection with this work may be
mentioned the late Mr W Bladess
_Shakspere and Typography being an
attempt to show Shaksperes personal
connection with and technical knowledge of
the Art of Printing also Remarks upon
some common typographical errors with
especial reference to the text of Shakspere_
1872 a small work of very great interest
and value Mr Blades writes Now
these typographical blunders will in the
majority of cases be found to fall into
one of three classes viz

Errors of the ear

Errors of the eye and

Errors from what in printers language
is called a foul case

I _Errors of the Ear_Every compositor
when at work reads over a few
words of his copy and retains them in
his mind until his fingers have picked
p 105up the various types belonging to them
While the memory is thus repeating to
itself a phrase it is by no means
unnatural nor in practice is it uncommon
for some word or words to become
unwittingly supplanted in the mind by others
which are similar in sound It was simply
a mental transposition of syllables that
made the actor exclaim


My Lord stand back and let the parson cough 

instead of


My Lord stand back and let the coffin pass
 _Richard III_ i 2

And by a slight confusion of sound the
word _mistake_ might appear in type as
must take


So you mistake your husbands
 _Hamlet_ iii 2

Again _idle votarist_ would easily become
_idol votarist_


I am no idle votarist_Timon_ iv 3

and _long delays_ become transformed to
_longer days_


This done see that you take no long delays
 _Titus_ iv 2

p 106From the time of Gutenberg until now
this similarity of sound has been a fruitful
source of error among printers

II _Errors of the Eye_The eye often
misleads the hand of the compositor
especially if he be at work upon a crabbed
manuscript or wornout reprint Take
out a dot and _This time goes manly_
becomes


This tune goes manly _Macbeth_ iv 3

So a clogged letter turns _What beast wast
then_ into _What boast wast then_

 Lady M What beast wast then
 That made you break this enterprise to me
 _Macbeth_ i 7

Examples might be indefinitely multiplied
from many an old book so I will quote
but one more instance The word _preserve_
spelt with a long _s_ might without
much carelessness be misread _preferre_
I _Henry VI_ iii 2 and thus entirely
alter the sense

III _Errors from a foul case_This
class of errors is of an entirely different
p 107kind from the two former They came
from within the man and were from the
brain this is from without mechanical in
its origin as well as in its commission As
many readers may never have seen the
inside of a printing office the following
short explanation may be found useful
A case is a shallow wooden drawer
divided into numerous square receptacles
called boxes and into each box is put
one sort of letter only say all _a_s or _b_s
or _c_s The compositor works with two of
these cases slanting up in front of him
and when from a shake a slip or any
other accident the letters become
misplaced the result is technically known as
a foul case A further result is that the
fingers of the workman although going to
the proper box will often pick up a wrong
letter he being entirely unconscious the
while of the fact

Now if we can discover any law which
governs this abnormal position of the types
if for instance we can predicate that the
letter _o_ when away from its own will be
more frequently found in the box appropriated
to letter _a_ than any other that _b_
p 108has a general tendency to visit the _l_ box
and _l_ the _v_ box and that _d_ if away
from home will be almost certainly found
among the _n_s if we can show this we
shall then lay a good foundation for the
reexamination of many corrupt or disputed
readings in the text of Shakspere
some of which may receive fresh life from
such a treatment

To start with let us obtain a definite
idea of the arrangement of the types in
both upper and lower case in the
time of Shaksperea time when long _s_s
with the logotypes _ct_ _ff_ _fi_ _ffi_ _ffl_ _sb_ _sh_
_si_ _sl_ _ss_ _ssi_ _ssl_ and others were in daily
use

Mr Blades then refers to Moxons
_Mechanical Exercises_ 1683 which contains
a representation of the compositors
cases in the seventeenth century which
may be presumed to be the same in form
as those used in Shakespeares day
Various alterations have been made in
the arrangement of the cases with the
object of placing the letters more
conveniently The present form is shown
on pp 110 111
p 109

Mr Blades proceeds The chief cause
of a foul case was the same in Shaksperes
time as now and no one interested
in the subject should omit visiting
a printing office where he could personally
inspect the operation Suppose a
compositor at work distributing the upper
and lower cases one above the other
slant at a considerable angle towards him
and as the types fall quickly from his
fingers they form conical heaps in their
respective boxes spreading out in a
manner very similar to the sand in the
lower half of an hourglass Now if the
compositor allows his case to become too
full the topmost letters in each box will
certainly slide down into the box below
and occasionally though rarely into one
of the side boxes When such letters
escape notice they necessarily cause
erroneous spelling and sometimes entirely
change the whole meaning of a sentence
But now comes the important question
Are errors of this kind ever discovered
and especially do they occur in Shakspere
Doubtless they do but to what extent a
long and careful examination alone can

p 112show As examples merely and to show
the possible change in sense made by a
single wrong letter I will quote one or
two instances

 Were they not _forcd_ with those that should be ours
 We might have met them darefull beard to beard
 _Macbeth_ v 59


 9 Colliers MS corrector substituted _farcd_ for _forcd_


The word _forced_ should be read _farced_
the letter _o_ having evidently dropped
down into _a_ box The enemys ranks
were not _forced_ with Macbeths followers
but _farced_ or filled up In Murrells
_Cookery_ 1632 this identical word is used
several times we there see that a
farced leg of mutton was when the meat
was all taken out of the skin mixed with
herbs etc and then the skin filled up
again

 I come to thee for charitable license   
 To booke our dead
 _Henry V_ iv 7

So all the copies but to book is surely
a modern commercial phrase and the
p 113Herald here asked leave simply to look
or to examine the dead for the purpose
of giving honourable burial to their men
of rank In the same sense Sir W Lucie
in the First Part of _Henry VI_ says

 I come to know what prisoners thou hast tane
 And to survey the bodies of the dead

We cannot imagine an officer with pen
inkhorn and paper at a period when few
could write booking the dead We
may I think take it for granted that here
the letter _b_ had fallen over into the _l_
box

Another point to bear in mind is the
existence of such logotypes as _fi_ _si_ etc
so that as Mr Blades says the change of
light into sight must not be considered as
a question of a single letterof _s_ in the
_l_ box because the box containing _si_ is
far away from the _l_ box and their contents
could not well get mixed

To these instances given by Mr Blades
may be added a very interesting correction
suggested to the author some years ago
by a Shakespearian student When Isabella
visits her brother in prison the
p 114cowardly Claudio breaks forth in
complaint and paints a vivid picture of the
horrors of the damned

 Ay but to die and go we know not where
 To lie in cold obstruction and to rot
 This sensible warm motion to become
 A kneaded clod and the _delighted spirit_
 To bathe in fiery floods or to reside
 In thrilling regions of thickribbed ice
 To be imprisoned in the viewless winds
 And blown with restless violence round about
 The pendent world or to be worse than worst
 Of those that lawless and incertain thoughts
 Imagine howlingtis too horrible
 The weariest and most loathed worldly life
 That age ache penury and imprisonment
 Can lay on nature is a paradise
 To what we fear of death
 _Measure for Measure_ act iii sc 1

We have here in the expression delighted
spirit a difficulty which none of
the commentators have as yet been able
to explain Warburton said that the
adjective meant accustomed to ease
and delights but this was not a very
successful guess although Steevens
adopted it Sir Thomas Hanmer altered
_delighted_ to _dilated_ and Dr Johnson
p 115mentions two suggested emendations
one being _benighted_ and the other
_delinquent_ None of these suggestions can
be corroborated by a reference to the
plans of the printers cases but it will be
seen that the one now proposed is much
strengthened by the position of the boxes
in those plans The suggested word is
_deleted_ which accurately describes the
spirits as destroyed or blotted out of
existence The word is common in the
printing office and it was often used in
literature

If we think only of the recognised
spelling of the word _delighted_ we shall
find that there are three letters to alter
but if we take the older spelling _delited_
the change is very easily made for it
will be noticed that the letters in the
_i_ box might easily tumble over into the
_e_ box

There is a very curious description of
hell in Bedes _Ecclesiastical History_ where
the author speaks of deformed spirits
who leap from excess of heat to cutting
cold and it is not improbable that
Shakespeare may have had this passage in his
p 116mind when he put these words into the
mouth of Claudio10


 10 An article on this point will be found in _The
Antiquary_ vol viii 1883 p 200



It is taken for granted that the
compositor is not likely to put his hand into
the wrong box so that if a wrong letter
is used it must have fallen out of its
place

An important class of misprints owes
its origin to this misplacement but as
noticed by Mr Blades there are other
classes such as misspellings caused by
the compositors ignorance or
misunderstanding We must remember that the
printer has to work fast and if he does
not recognise a word he is very likely to
turn it into something he does understand
Thus the title of a paper in the
_Philosophical Transactions_ was curiously
changed in an advertisement and the
Calamites a species of fossil plants of
the coal measures with but slight change
appeared as The True Fructification of
Calamities This is a blunder pretty sure
to be made and within a few days of
writing this the author has seen a
referp 117ence to Notes on some Pennsylvanian
Calamities As an instance of less
excusable ignorance we shall often find the
word _gauge_ printed as _guage_

One of the slightest of misprints was
the cause of an odd query in the second
series of _Notes and Queries_ which by the
way has never yet been answered In
John Halls _Horae Vacivae_ 1646 there is
this passage alluding to the table game
called _ticktack_ The author wrote
Tick tack sets a mans intentions on
their guard Errors in this and war can
be but once amended but the printer
joined the two words and war into one
and this puzzled the correspondent of
the _Notes and Queries_ v 272 He
asked Who can quote another passage
from any author containing this word
I have hunted after it in many dictionaries
without avail It means I suppose
antagonism or contest and resembles in
form many AngloSaxon words which
never found their way into English proper
The blunder was not discovered and
another correspondent wrote The word
andwar would surely modernise into
_handp 118war_ Is not andirons handirons a
parallel word of the same genus In
the General Index we find Andwar an
old English word So much for the long
life of a very small blunder

A very similar blunder to this of
andwar occurs in _Select Remains of the
learned John Ray with his Life by the late
William Derham_ which was published
in 1760 with a dedication to the Earl of
Macclesfield President of the Royal
Society signed by George Scott In
Derhams Life of Ray a list of books
read by Ray in 1667 is printed from
a letter to Dr Lister and one of these
is printed The Business about great
Rakes Mr Scott must have been
puzzled with this title but he was
evidently a man not to be daunted by a
difficulty for he added a note to this
effect They are now come into general
use among the farmers and are called
_drag rakes_ Who would suspect after
this that the title is merely a misprint
and that the pamphlet refers to the
proceedings of Valentine Greatrakes the
famous stroker who claimed equal power
p 119with the kings and queens of England in
curing the kings evil This blunder will
be found uncorrected in Dr Lankesters
_Memorials of John Ray_ published by the
Ray Society in 1846 and does not seem
to have been suspected until the Rev
Richard Hooper called attention to it a
short time ago in _Notes and Queries_11


 11 Seventh Series iv 225



An amusing instance of the invention
of a new word was afforded when the
printer produced the words a noticeable
fact in thisms instead of this MS

The misplacement of a stop or the
transposition of a letter or the dropping
out of one will make sad havoc of the
sense of a passage as when we read of
the _immoral_ works of Milton It was
however a very complimentary misprint
by which it was made to appear that a
certain town had a remarkably high rate
of _morality_ In the address to Dr Watts
by J Standen prefixed to that authors
_Horae Lyricae_ Leeds 1788 this same
misprint occurs to the serious confusion
of Mr Standens meaning
p 120
 With thought sublime
 And high sonorous words thou sweetly singst
 To thy _immoral_ lyre

On another page of this same book
Watts daring flight is transposed to
_darling flight_

In Miss Yonges _Dynevor Terrace_ a
portion of one word was joined on to
another with the awkward result that a
young lady is described without stretched
arms

The odd results of the misplacement of
stops must be familiar to most readers
but it is not often that they are so serious
as in the following instances William
Sharp the celebrated line engraver
believed in the Divine mission of the madman
Richard Brothers and engraved a portrait of
that worthy with the following inscription
beneath it Fully believing this to be the
man appointed by God I engrave his
likenessW SHARP The writing engraver
by mistake put the comma after the word
appointed and omitted it at the latter part
of the sentence thus giving a ludicrous
effect to the whole inscription Many
impressions were struck off before the
p 121mistake was discovered and rectified The
question of an apostrophe was the ground
of a civil action a few years ago in
Switzerland and although the anecdote refers to
a manuscript and not to a printed document
it is inserted here because it illustrates
the subject A gentleman left a will
which ended thus Et pour temoigner
a mes neveux Charles et Henri de M
toute mon affection je legue a chacun
_deux_ cent mille francs The paper upon
which the will was written was folded up
before the ink was dry and therefore many
of the letters were blotted The legatees
asserted that the apostrophe was a blot
and therefore claimed two instead of one
hundred thousand francs each

Several misprints are always recurring
such as the mixture of the words
Topography and Typography and Biography
with Bibliography In the prospectus of
an edition of the _Waverley Novels_ we
read The aim of the publishers has
been to make it preeminent by beauty
of _topography_ and illustration as an _edition
de luxe_

Andrew Marvell published a book which
p 122he entitled _The Rehearsal Transprosed_ but
it is seldom that a printer can be induced
to print the title otherwise than as _The
Rehearsal Transposed_

It must be conceded in favour of printers
that some authors do write an execrable
hand One sometimes receives a letter
which requires about three readings before
it can be understood At the first time of
reading the meaning is scarcely intelligible
at the second time some faint glimpse of the
writers object in writing is obtained and
at the third time the main point of the
letter is deciphered Such men may be
deemed to be the plague of printers A
friend of Beloe the Sexagenarian was
remonstrated with by a printer for being
the cause of a large amount of swearing
in his office Sir exclaimed Mr A
the moment copy from you is divided
among the compositors volley succeeds
volley as rapidly and as loudly as in one
of Lord Nelsons victories

There is a popular notion among authors
that it is not wise to write a clear hand and
Menage was one of the first to express it
He wrote If you desire that no mistakes
p 123shall appear in the works which you publish
never send wellwritten copy to the
printer for in that case the manuscript is
given to young apprentices who make a
thousand errors while on the other hand
that which is difficult to read is dealt with
by the masterprinters It is also related
that the late eminent Arabic scholar Mr
E W Lane who wrote a particularly good
hand asked his printer how it was that
there were always so many errors in his
proofs He was answered that such clear
writing was always given to the boys as
experienced compositors could not be
spared for it The late Dean Hook held
to this opinion for when he was asked to
allow a sermon to be copied out neatly for
the press he answered that if it were to
be printed he would prefer to write it
out himself as badly as he could This
practice if it ever existed we are told by
experienced printers does not exist now

It must one would think have been
the badness of the copy that induced
the compositors to turn the nature and
theory of the Greek verb into _the native
theology of the Greek verb_ the conserp 124vation
of energy into the _conversation of
energy_ and the Forest Conservancy
Branch into the _Forest Conservatory
Branch_

Some printers go out of their way to
make blunders when they are unable to
understand their copy Thus in the
_Times_ some years ago among the contributors
to the Garibaldi Fund was a bookbinder
who gave five shillings The next
down in the list was one A Lega
Fletcher a name which was printed as _A
Ledger stitcher_

Some very extraordinary blunders have
been made by the ignorant misreading
of an authors contractions It is said
that in a certain paper which was sent
to be printed the words Indian Government
were contracted as Indian Govt
This one compositor set up throughout
his turn as _Indian goat_ A writer in
one of the Reviews wrote the words J C
first invaded Britain and a worthy
compositor who made it his business to fill
up all the abbreviations printed this as
_Jesus Christ_ instead of Julius Caesar

Here it may be remarked that some of
p 125the most extraordinary misprints never
get farther than the printing office or the
study but although they may have been
discovered by the reader or the author
they were made nevertheless

Sometimes the fun of a misprint consists
in its elaborateness and completeness
and sometimes in its simplicity
perhaps only the change of a letter
Of the first class the transformation of
Shirleys wellknown lines is a good
example

 Only the actions of the just
 Smell sweet and blossom in the dust

is scarcely recognisable as

 All the low actions of the just
 Swell out and blow Sam in the dust

The statement that men should work
and play Loo obtained from men should
work and play too illustrates the second
class

The version of Pope which was quoted
by a correspondent of the _Times_ about a
year ago is very charming

 A little learning is a dangerous thing
 Drink deep or taste not the aperient spring

p 126The reporter or printer who mistook the
Oxford professors allusion to the
Eumenides and quoted him as speaking of
those terrible old Greek goddessesthe
Humanities was still more elaborate in
his joke

Horace Greeley is well known to have
been an exceedingly bad writer but when
he quoted the wellknown line which is
said to be equal to a florin because there
are four tizzies in it

  Tis true tis pity pity tis tis true

one might have expected the compositor
to recognise the quotation instead of
printing the astonishing calculation

  Tis two tis fifty and fifty tis tis five

This is as bad as the blunder of the
printer of the Hampshire paper who is
said to have announced that Sir Robert
Peel and a party of _fiends_ were engaged
shooting _peasants_ at Drayton Manor

It is perhaps scarcely fair to quote too
many blunders from newspapers which
must often be hurriedly compiled but
naturally they furnish the richest crop
p 127The point of a leader in an American
paper was lost by a misprint which reads
as follows We do battle without shot or
charge for the cause of the right This
would be a very ineffectual battle and the
proper words were _without stint or change_

A writer on Holland in one of the
magazines quoted Samuel Butlers well
known lines

 A country that draws fifty foot of water
       
 In which they do not live but go aboard

which the printer transformed into

 In which they do not live but _cows abound_


It is of course easy to invent
misprints and therefore one feels a little
doubtful sometimes with respect to those
which are quoted without chapter and
verse

One of the most remarkable blunders
ever made in a newspaper was connected
with the burial of the wellknown literary
man John Payne Collier In the _Standard_
of Sept 21st 1883 it was reported
that the remains of the late Mr
John Payne Collier were interred yesterday
p 128in Bray Churchyard near Maidenhead
in the presence of a large number of
spectators The paragraph maker of the
_Eastern Daily Press_ had never heard of
Payne Collier so he thought the last name
should be printed with a small C and
wanting a heading for his paragraph he
invented one straight off and this is what
appeared in that paper

_The Bray Colliery Disaster_ The
remains of the late John Payne collier
were interred yesterday afternoon in the
Bray Churchyard in the presence of a
large number of friends and spectators

This was a brilliant stroke of
imagination for who would expect to find a
colliery near Maidenhead

Mr Sala writing to _Notes and Queries_
Third Series i 365 says Altogether I
have long since arrived at the conclusion
that there are more devils in a printing
office than are dreamt of in our philosophy
the blunder fiends to witever
busy in peppering the formes with errors
which defy the minutest revisions of
reader author subeditor and editor
Mr Sala gives an instance which occurred
p 129to himself He wrote that Dr
Livingstone wore a cap with a tarnished gold
lace band but the printer altered the
word tarnished into _famished_ to the serious
confusion of the passage

Some of the most amusing blunders
occur by the change of a single letter
Thus in an account of the danger to an
express train by a cow getting on the line
in front the reporter was made to say that
as the safest course under the circumstances
the engine driver put on full
steam dashed up against the cow and
literally cut it into _calves_ A short time
ago an account was given in an address of
the early struggles of an eminent portrait
painter and the statement appeared in
print that working at the easel from eight
oclock in the morning till eight oclock
at night the artist only lay down on the
hearthrug for rest and refreshment between
the visits of his _sisters_ This is
not so bad however as the report that
a bride was accompanied to the altar by
_tight_ bridesmaids A very odd blunder
occurred in the _World_ of Oct 6th 1886
one which was so odd that the editor
p 130thought it worthy of notice by himself in
a subsequent number The paragraph in
which the misprint occurred related to the
filling up of the vicarage of St Marys
Islington which it was thought had been
unduly delayed The trustees in whose
gift the living is were informed that if they
had a difficulty in finding a clergyman of
the proper complexion of low churchism
there were still Venns in Kent Here
the natural confusion of the letters _u_ and
_n_ came into play and as the paragraph
was printed it appeared that a _Venus_ of
Kent was recommended for the vicarage
of St Marys

The compositor who set up the account
of a public welcome to a famous orator
must have been fresh from the study of
Porsons _Catechism of the Swinish Multitude_
when he set up the damaging statement
that the crowd rent the air with
their _snouts_

Sometimes the blunder consists not in
the misprint of a letter but in a mere
transposition as when an eminent herald
and antiquary was dubbed _Rogue Croix_
instead of _Rouge Croix_ Sometimes a
p 131new but appropriate word results by the
thrusting into a recognised word of a
redundant letter as when a man died from
eating too much goose the verdict was
said to have been death from stuffocation

Many of these blunders although
amusing to the public cannot have been
altogether agreeable to the subjects of them
Mr Justice Wightman could not have
been pleased to see himself described
as _Mr Justice Nightman_ and the right
reverend prelate who was stated to be
highly pleased with some ecclesiastical
_iniquities_ shown to him must have been
considerably scandalised

Professor Hales is very much of the
opinion of Mr Sala respecting the labours
of the blunder fiend and he sent an
amusing letter to the _Athenaeum_ in which
he pointed out a curious misprint in one
of his own books As the contents of the
letter is very much to the point readers
will perhaps not object to seeing it
transferred in its entirety to these pages

The humour of compositors is apt to be
imperfectly appreciated by authors because
p 132it rather interferes with what the author
wishes to say although it may often say
something better But there is no reason
why the general reader should not
thoroughly enjoy it Certainly it ought to
be more generously recognised than it is
So many persons at present think of it
as merely accidental and fortuitous as if
there was no mind in it as if all the
excellent things loosely described as _errata_ all
the _curiosae felicitates_ of the setterup of
texts were casual blunders Such a view
reminds one of the way in which the last
century critics used to speak of Shakspere
the critics who give him no credit for
design or selection but thought that somehow
or other he stumbled into greatness
However I propose now not to attempt
the defence or what might be worth the
effort the analysis of this species of Wit
but only to give what seemed an admirable
instance of it

In a note to the word _limboes_ in the
Clarendon Press edition of Miltons
_Areopagitica_ I quoted from Naress Glossary
a list of the various _limbi_ believed
in by the old schoolmen and No 2
p 133was a _limbus patrum_ where the fathers
of the Church saints and martyrs awaited
the general resurrection Will any one
say it was not a stroke of genius in some
printingoffice humourist to alter the last
word into _in_surrection

Like all good wit this change is so
suggestive It raises up a cloud of new
ideas and reduces the hearer to a delightful
confusion How strangely it revises
all our popular notions If even beyond
the grave the great problems that keep
men here restless and murmuring are not
solved If even there the rebellious spirit
is not quieted Nay if those whom we
think of as having won peace for themselves
in this world do in that join the
malcontents and are each one biding their
time

Allusion has already been made to the
persistency of misprints and the difficulty
of curing them but one of the most
p 134curious instances of this may be found in
a line of Byrons beautiful apostrophe to
the ocean in _Childe Harold_ Canto iv
The one hundred and eightysecond
stanza is usually printed

 Thy shores are empires changed in all save thee
 Assyria Greece Rome Carthage what are they
 Thy waters wasted them while they were free
 And many a tyrant since   

Not many years ago a critic asking
himself the question when the waters
wasted these countries began to suspect
a misprint and on consulting the
manuscript it was found that he was right
The blunder which had escaped Byrons
own eyes was corrected and the third
line was printed as originally written

 Thy waters washd them power while they were free


The carelessness of printers seems to
hare culminated in their production of
the Scriptures The old editions of the
Bible swarm with blunders and some of
them were supposed to have been made
intentionally It was said that the printer
p 135Field received Pd1500 from the
Independents as a bribe to corrupt a text which
might sanction their practice of lay
ordination and in Acts vi 3 the word _ye_ is
substituted for _we_ in several of his editions
of the Bible The verse reads Wherefore
brethren look ye out among ye seven
men of honesr report full of the Holy
Ghost and wisdom whom _ye_ may appoint
over this business To such forgeries
Butler refers in the lines


 Religion spawnd a various rout
 Of petulant capricious sects
 The maggots of corrupted texts
 _Hudibras_ Part III Canto 2


Dr Grey in his notes on this passage
brings forward the charge against Field
and quotes Wottons Visitation Sermon
1706 in support of it He also quotes
from Cowleys _Puritan and Papist_ as to
the practice of corrupting texts


 They a bold powr oer sacred Scriptures take
 Blot out some clauses and some new ones make


Pope Sixtus the Fifths Vulgate so
swarmed with errors that paper had to
p 136be pasted over some of the erroneous
passages and the public naturally laughed
at the bull prefixed to the first volume
which excommunicated any printer who
altered the text This was all the more
annoying to the Pope as he had intended
the edition to be specially free from errors
and to attain that end had seen all the
proofs himself Some years ago a copy
of this book was sold in France for 1210
francs

The Kings Printers Robert Barker and
Martin Lucas in the reign of Charles I
were not excommunicated but what perhaps
they liked less were fined Pd300
by the Court of High Commission for
leaving the _not_ out of the seventh
commandment in an edition of the Bible
printed in 1631 Although this story has
been frequently quoted it has been
disbelieved and the great bibliographer of
Bibles the late Mr George Offer asserted
that he and his father searched diligently
for it and could not find it Now six
copies are known to exist The late Mr
Henry Stevens gives a most interesting
account of the first discovery of the book
p 137in his _Recollections of Mr James Lennox_
He writes

Mr Lennox was so strict an observer
of the Sabbath that I never knew of his
writing a business letter on Sunday but
once In 1855 while he was staying at
Hotel Meurice in Paris there occurred to
me the opportunity one Saturday afternoon
June 16th of identifying the long lost
octavo Bible of 1631 with the negative
omitted in the seventh commandment
and purchasing it for fifty guineas No
other copy was then known and the
possessor required an immediate answer
However I raised some points of inquiry
and obtained permission to hold the little
sinner and give the answer on Monday
By that evenings post I wrote to Mr
Lennox and pressed for an immediate
reply suggesting that this prodigal though
he returned on Sunday should be
bound Monday brought a letter to
buy it very short but tender as a fatted
calf On June 21st I exhibited it at a
full meeting of the Society of Antiquaries
of London at the same time nicknaming
it _The Wicked Bible_ a name that stuck to
p 138it ever since though six copies are now
known    Lord Macaulay was present
at the meeting but did not at first credit
the genuineness of the typographical
error Lord Stanhope however on
borrowing the volume convinced him
that it was the true wicked error

Curiously enough when Mr Stevens
took the Bible home on Saturday night
he overhauled his pile of octavo Bibles
and found an imperfect duplicate of the
supposed unique wicked Bible When
the owner came for his book on Monday
morning he was shown the duplicate and
agreed as his copy was not unique to
take Pd25 for it The imperfect copy
was sold to the British Museum for
eighteen guineas and Mr Winter Jones
was actually so fortunate as to obtain
subsequently the missing twentythree
leaves A third copy came into the
hands of Mr Francis Fry of Bristol
who sold it to Dr Bandinel for the
Bodleian Library A fourth copy is in
the Euing Library at Glasgow a fifth
fell into the hands of Mr Henry J
Atkinson of Gunnersburyin 1883 and
p 139a sixth copy was picked up in Ireland
by a gentleman of Coventry In 1884

In a Bible of 1634 the first verse of
the 14th Psalm is printed as The fool
hath said in his heart there is God and
in another Bible of 1653 _worldly_ takes
the place of _godly_ and reads In order
that all the world should esteem the
means of arriving at worldly riches

If Field was not a knave as hinted
above he was singularly unfortunate in
his blunders for in another of his Bibles
he also omitted the negative in an important
passage and printed I Corinthians
vi 9 as Know ye not that the unrighteous
shall inherit the kingdom of God

It is recorded that a printers widow
in Germany once tampered with the
purity of the text of a Bible printed in
her house for which crime she was burned
to death She arose in the night when
all the workmen were in bed and going
to the forme entirely changed the
meaning of a text which particularly
offended her The text was Gen iii 16
Thy desire shall be to thy husband
and he shall rule over thee
p 140

This story does not rest on a very firm
foundation and as the recorder does not
mention the date of the occurrence it
must be taken by the reader for what it is
worth The following incident vouched
for by a wellknown author is however
very similar James Silk Buckingham
relates the following curious anecdote in
his _Autobiography_

While working at the Clarendon
Printing Office a story was current among
the men and generally believed to be
authentic to the following effect Some
of the gay young students of the University
who loved a practical joke had made
themselves sufficiently familiar with the
manner in which the types are fixed in
certain formes and laid on the press and
with the mode of opening such formes for
correction when required and when the
sheet containing the Marriage Service was
about to be worked off as finally
corrected they unlocked the forme took out
a single letter _v_ and substituted in its
place the letter _k_ thus converting the
word _live_ into _like_ The result was that
when the sheets were printed that part
p 141of the service which rendered the bond
irrevocable was so changed as to make it
easily dissolvedas the altered passage
now read as followsThe minister asking
the bridegroom Wilt thou have this
woman to be thy wedded wife to live
together after Gods ordinance in the holy
state of matrimony Wilt thou love her
comfort her honour and keep her in
sickness and in health and forsaking all
other keep thee only unto her so long as
ye both shall _like_ To which the man
shall answer I will The same change
was made in the question put to the
bride

If the culprits who left out a word
deserved to be heavily mulcted in damages
it is difficult to calculate the liability of
those who left out whole verses When
Archbishop Ussher was hastening to
preach at Pauls Cross he went into a
shop to purchase a Bible and on turning
over the pages for his text found it was
omitted

Andrew Anderson a careless faulty
printer in Edinburgh obtained a monopoly
as kings printer which was exercised on
p 142his death in 1679 by his widow The
productions of her press became worse and
worse and her Bibles were a standing
disgrace to the country Robert
Chambers in his _Domestic Annals of
Scotland_ quotes the following specimen
from an edition of 1705 Whyshouldit
bethougtathingincredi ble wtS you ytS
God should raise the dead Even this
miserable blundering could not have been
much worse than the Pearl Bible with
six thousand errata mentioned by Isaac
Disraeli

The first edition of the English Scriptures
printed in Ireland was published at
Belfast in 1716 and is notorious for an
error in Isaiah _Sin no more_ is printed
_Sin on more_ In the following year was
published at Oxford the wellknown
Vinegar Bible which takes its name from
a blunder in the running title of the
twentieth chapter of St Lukes Gospel
where it reads The parable of the
vinegar instead of The parable of the
vineyard In a Cambridge Prayer Book
of 1778 the thirtieth verse of Psalm cv is
travestied as follows Their land brought
p 143forth frogs yea seven in their kings
chambers An Oxford Bible of 1792
names St Philip instead of St Peter as
the disciple who should deny Christ
Luke xxii 34 and in an Oxford New
Testament of 1864 we read Rejoice
and be exceeding _clad_ Matt v 12
To be impartial however it is necessary to
mention a Cambridge Bible of 1831
where Psalm cxix 93 appears as I will
never _forgive_ thy precepts A Bible
printed at Edinburgh in 1823 contains
a curious misprint caused by a likeness in
pronunciation of two words Esther being
printed for Easter Intending after
Esther to bring him forth to the people
Acts xii 4 A misprint of the old
hundredth Psalm _do well_ for _do dwell_ in
the Prayer Book might perhaps be
considered as an improvement

 All people who on earth do well


Errors are specially frequent in figures
often caused by the way in which the
characters are cut The aim of the
founder seems to be to make them as
much alike as possible so that it
frep 144quently requires a keen eye to discover
the difference between a 3 and a 5 In
one of Chernacs _Mathematical Tables_
a line fell out before going to press and
instead of being replaced at the bottom
of the page it was put in at the top thus
causing twentysix errors Besides these
however only ten errors have been found
in the whole work of 1020 pages all full
of figures Vietas _Canon Mathematicus_
1579 is of great rarity from the author
being discontented with the misprints
that had escaped his notice and on that
account withdrawing or repurchasing all
the copies he could meet with Some
mathematicians to ensure accuracy have
made their calculations with the types in
their own hands In the _Imperial
Dictionary of Universal Biography_ there is a
misprint in a date which confuses a whole
article William Ayrton musical critic
is said to have been born in London
about 1781 but curiously enough his
father is reported to have been born three
years afterwards 1784 and still more
odd that father was appointed gentleman
of the Chapel Royal in 1764 twenty
p 145years before he is stated to have been
born

In connection with figures may be
mentioned the terrible confusion which
is caused by the simple dropping out
of a decimal point Thus a passage
in which 636 is referred to naturally
becomes utter nonsense when 636 is
printed instead Such a misprint is as
bad as the blunder of the French compositor
who having to set up a passage
referring to Captain Cook turned _de Cook_
into _de 600 kilos_ An amusing blunder
was quoted a few years ago from a German
paper where the writer referring to Prince
Bismarcks endeavours to keep on good
terms with all the Powers was made
to say Prince Bismarck is trying to
keep up honest and straightforward relations
_with all the girls_ This blunder was
caused by the substitution of the word
Madchen girls for Machten powers

The French have always been interested
in misprints and they have registered a
considerable number One of the happiest
is that one which was caused by Malherbes
bad writing and induced him to
p 146adopt the misprint in his verse in place
of that which he had originally written
The lines written on a daughter of Du
Perrier named Rosette now stand thus


 Mais elle etait du monde ou les plus belles choses
 Ont le pire destin
 Et rose elle a vecu ce que vivent les roses
 Lespace dun matin

Malherbe had written

 Et Rosette a vecu ce que vivent les roses


but forgetting to cross his tees the
compositor made the fortunate blunder
of printing _rose elle_ which so pleased the
author that he let it stand and modified
the following lines in accordance with the
printers improvement

Rabelais nearly got into trouble by
a blunder of his printer who in several
places set up _asne_ for _ame_ A council
met at the Sorbonne to consider the
case against him and the doctors formally
denounced Rabelais to Francis I
and requested permission to prosecute
him for heresy but the king after
consideration refused to give the permission
p 147Rabelais then laughed at his accusers for
founding a charge of heresy against him
on a printers blunder but there were
strong suspicions that the misprints were
intentional

These misprints are styled by the
French _coquilles_ a word whose derivation
M Boutney author of _Dictionnaire
de lArgot des Typographes_ is unable
to explain after twenty years search A
number of _Longmans Magazine_ contains
an article on these _coquilles_ in which
very many amusing blunders are quoted
One of these gave rise to a pun which is
so excellent that it is impossible to resist
the temptation of transferring the anecdote
from those pages to these

In the Rue Richelieu there is a statue
of Corneille holding a roll in his hand
on which are inscribed the titles of his
principal works The task of incising
these names it appears had been given
to an illiterate young apprentice who
thought proper to spell _avare_ with two
rs A wit observing this remarked
pleasantly _Tiens voila an avare qui a un
air misanthrope_ un r mis en trop
p 148

In a newspaper account of Mr Gladstones
religious views the word _Anglican_
is travestied as _Afghan_ with the following
curious result There is no form of faith
in existence more effectually tenacious
than the _Afghan_ form which asserts the
full catholicity of that branch church
whose charter is the English Church
Prayer Book

In the diary of John Hunter of
Craigcrook it is recorded that at one of the
meetings between the diarist Leigh Hunt
and Carlyle Hunt gave us some capital
specimens of absurd errors of the press
committed by printers from his copy
One very good one occurs in a paper
where he had said he had a liking for
coffee because it always reminded him of
the _Arabian Nights_ though not mentioned
there adding as smoking does
for the same reason This was converted
into the following oracular words As
sucking does for the snow season He
could not find it in his heart to correct
this and thus it stands as a theme for
the profound speculations of the commentators
p 149

A very slight misprint will make a
great difference sometimes an unintelliglble
word is produced but sometimes
the mere transposition of a letter will
make a word exactly opposite in its
meaning to the original as _unite_ for
_untie_ In Jeremy Taylors _XXV Sermons
preached at Golden Grove Being for the
Winter halfyear_ London 1653 p 247
we read It may help to unite the
charm whereas the author wished to
say untie

The title of Cobbetts _Horsehoeing
Husbandry_ was easily turned into _Horseshoeing
Husbandry_ that of the _Holy Grail_ into
_Holy Gruel_ and Layamons _Brut_ into
Layamons _Brat_

A local paper reporting the proceedings
at the Bath meeting of the British Assosic
ciation affirmed that an eminent chemist
had not been able to find any _fluidity_
in the Bath waters _Fluorine_ was meant
It was also stated that a geologist asserted
that the bones found in the submerged
forests of Devonshire were closely
representative of the British _farmer_ The last
word should have been _fauna_
p 150

The strife of _tongs_ is suggestive of a
more serious battle than that of talk only
and the compositor who set up Portias
speech

    young Alcides when he did redeem
 The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
 _Merchant of Venice_ act iii sc 2

and turned the last words into _howling
Tory_ must have been a rabid politician

The transposition of He kissed her
under the silent stars into He kicked
her under the cellar stairs looks rather
too good to be true and it cannot be
vouched for but the title Microscopic
Character of the Virtuous Rocks of Montana
is a genuine misprint for _vitreous_
as is also Buddhas perfect _uselessness_
for Buddhas perfect sinlessness It is
rather startling to find a quotation from
the _Essay on Man_ introduced by the
words as the Pope says or to find the
famous painter Old Crome styled an old
Crone

A most amusing instance of a
misreading may be mentioned here although
it is not a literary blunder A certain
p 151black cat was named Mephistopheles
a name which greatly puzzled the little
girl who played with the cat so she
very sensibly set to work to reduce
the name to a form which she could
understand and she arrived at Miss
Packoffleas

Sometimes a ludicrous blunder may be
made by the mere closing up of two
words thus the orator who spoke of our
grand Mother Church had his remark
turned into a joke when it was printed
as grandmother Church A still worse
blunder was made in an obituary notice
of a wellknown congressman in an
American paper where the reference to
his gentle manly spirit was turned
into gentlemanly spirit

Misprints are very irritating to most
authors but some can afford to make fun
of the trouble thus Hoods amusing
lines are probably founded upon some
blunder that actually occurred


 But it is frightful to think
 What nonsense sometimes
 They make of ones sense
 And whats worse of ones rhymes

p 152
 It was only last week
 In my ode upon Spring
 Which I meant to have made
 A most beautiful thing

 When I talked of the dewdrops
 From freshlyblown roses
 The nasty things made it
 From freshlyblown noses

 And again when to please
 An old aunt I had tried
 To commemorate some saint
 Of her clique who had died

 I said he had taken up
 In heaven his position
 And they put ithed taken
 Up to heaven his _physician_


Henry Stephens Estienne the learned
printer made a joke over a misprint The
word _febris_ was printed with the diphthong
_oe_ so Stephens excused himself by saying
in the errata that le chalcographe a fait
une fievre longue foebrem quoique une
fievre courte febrem soit moins dangereux

Allusion has already been made in the
first chapter to Professor Skeats ghost
p 153words Most of these have arisen from
misreadings or misprints and two
extraordinary instances may be noted here
The purely modern phrase look sharp
was supposed to have been used in the time
of Chaucer because loke schappe see
that you form etc of the manuscript was
printed loke scharpe In the other
instance the scribe wrote _yn_ for _m_ and
thus he turned chek matyde into
chek yn a tyde12

In the _Academy_ for Feb 25th 1888
Dr Skeat explained another discovery
of his of the same kind by which he is
able to correct a timehonoured blunder
in English literature

 CAMBRIDGE _Feb_ 14 1888


When I explained in the _Academy_ for
January 7 p 9 that the word Herenus 
is simply a mistake for Herines _ie_ the
furies such being the MiddleEnglish form
of Erinnyes I did not expect that I should
so soon light upon another singular
perversion of the same word
p 154

In Chaucers Works ed 1561 fol
322 back there is a miserable poem of
much later date than that of Chaucers
death entitled The Remedie of Love
The twelfth stanza begins thus

 Come hither thou Hermes and ye furies all
 Which fer been under us nigh the nether pole
 Where Pluto reigneth etc

It is clear that Hermes is a scribal error
for Herines and that the scribe has
added thou out of his own head to
keep Hermes company The context
bears this out for the author utterly
rejects the inspiration of the Muses in the
preceding stanza and proceeds to invoke
furies harpies and to use his own
expression all this lothsome sort Many
of the lines almost defy scansion so that
no help is to be got from observing the
run of the lines Nevertheless this fresh
instance of the occurrence of Herines
much assists my argument all the more
so as it appears in a disguised shape
 WALTER W SKEAT

Sometimes a misprint is intentional as
p 155in the following instance At the
beginning of the century the _Courrier des Pays
Bas_ was bought by some young men who
changed its politics but kept on the editor
The motto of the paper was from Horace

 Est modus in rebus

and the editor wishing to let his friends
at a distance know that things were not
going on quite well between him and his
proprietors printed this motto as

 Est nodus in rebus

This was continued for three weeks before
it was discovered and corrected by the
persons concerned

Another kind of misprint which we see
occasionally is the misplacement of some
lines of type This may easily occur when
the formes are being locked and the result
is naturally nonsense that much confuses
the reader Probably the finest instance of
this misplacement occurred some years ago
in an edition of _Men of the Time_ 1856
where the entry relating to Samuel
Wilberforce Bishop of Oxford got mixed up
with that of Robert Owen the Socialist
p 156with the result that the bishop was stated
to be a confirmed sceptic as regards
revealed religion but a believer in
Spiritualism It was this kind of blunder
which suggested the formation of cross
readings that were once very popular



CHAPTER VIL

SCHOOLBOYS BLUNDERS

THE blunders of the examined
form a fruitful source of
amusement for us all and many
comical instances have been published
The mistakes which are constantly
occurring must naturally be innumerable but
only a few of them rise to the dignity of
a blunder If it be difficult to define a
blunder probably the best illustration of
what it is will be found in the answers of
the boys under examination All classes
of blunders may be found among these
There are those which show confusion of
knowledge and those which exhibit an
insight into the heart of the matter while
blundering in the form Two very good
examples occur to ones mind but it is to
be feared that they owe their origin to
some keen spirit of mature years What
p 158is FaithThe quality by which we are
enabled to believe that which we know is
untrue Surely this must have
emanated from a wit Again the whole
Homeric question is condensed into the
following answer Some people say that
the Homeric poems were not written by
Homer but by another man of the same
name If this is a blunder who would
not wish to blunder so

A large class of schoolboys blunders
consist in a confusion of words somewhat
alike in sound a confusion that is apt to
follow some of us through life Matins
has been mixed up with pattens and
described as something to wear on the
feet Nonconformists are said to be
persons who cannot form anything and
a tartan is assumed to be an inhabitant
of Tartary The gods are believed by
one boy to live on nectarines and by
another to imbibe ammonia The same
desire to make an unintelligible word
express a meaning which has caused the
recognised but absurd spelling of _sovereign_
more wisely spelt _sovran_ by Milton
shows itself in the form Teatrarck
p 159explained as the title of Herod given to
him because he invented or was fond of
tea13 A still finer confusion of ideas is to
be found in an answer reported by Miss
Graham in the _University Correspondent_
Esau was a man who wrote fables and
who sold the copyright to a publisher for
a bottle of potash


 13 _Cornhill Magazine_ June 1888 pp 61928



The following etymological guesses are
not so good but they are worthy of
registration One boy described a blackguard
as one who has been a shoeblack while
another thought he was a man dressed
in black Polite is said to be derived
from Pole owing to the affability of the
Polish race Heathen means covered
with heath but this explanation is
commonplace when compared with the
brilliant guessHeathen from Latin
haethum faith and en not

The boy who explained the meaning of
the words _fort_ and _fortress_ must have had
rather vague ideas as to masculine and
feminine nouns He wrote A fort is
a place to put men in and a fortress a
place to put women in
p 160

The little book entitled _English as she
is Taught_ which contains a considerable
number of genuine answers to examination
questions given in American schools with
a Commentary by Mark Twain is full of
amusing matter A large proportion of
these answers are of a similar character
to those just enumerated blunders which
have arisen from a confusion caused by
similarity of sound in the various words
thus In Austria the principal occupation
is gathering Austrich feathers The
boy who propounded this evidently had
much of the stock in trade required
for the popular etymologist Ireland is
called the Emigrant Isle because it is
so beautiful and green Gorilla warfare
was where men rode on gorillas The
Puritans found an insane asylum in the
wilds of America

Some of the answers are so funny that
it is almost impossible to guess at the
train of thought which elicited them as
Climate lasts all the time and weather
only a few days Sanscrit is not used
so much as it used to be as it went out
of use 1500 BC The boy who affirmed
p 161that The imports of a country are the
things that are paid for the exports are
the things that are not did not put the
Theory of Exchange in very clear form

The knowledge of physiology and of
medical subjects exhibited by some of the
examined is very amusing One boy
discovered a new organ of the body called
a chrone He had a chronic disease
something the matter with the chrone
Another had a strange notion of how to
spell _craniology_ for he wrote Chonology
is the science of the brane But best
of all is the knowledge of the origin of
Brights disease shown by the boy who
affirms that John Bright is noted for an
incurable disease

Much of the blundering of the
examined must be traced to the absurd
questions of the examinersquestions
which as Mark Twain says would
oversize nearly anybodys knowledge
And the wish which every examinee
has to bring in some subject which he
supposes himself to know is perceptible
in many answers The date 1492 seems
to be impressed upon every American
p 162childs memory and he cannot rest until
he has associated it with some fact so
we learn that George Washington was
born in 1492 that St Bartholomew
was massacred in that year that the
Brittains were the Saxons who entered
England in 1492 under Julius Caesar
and to cap all that the earth is 1492
miles in circumference

Many of the bestknown examination
jokes are associated with Scriptural
characters One of the best of these if also
one of the best known is that of the man
who paraphrasing the parable of the Good
Samaritan and quoting his words to the
innkeeper When I come again I will
repay you added This he said knowing
that he should see his face again no more

A School Board boy competing for one
of the Peek prizes carried this confusion
of widely different events even farther
He had to write a short biography of
Jonah and he produced the following
He was the father of Lot and had two
wives One was called Ishmale and the
other Hagher he kept one at home and
he turned the other into the dessert when
p 163she became a pillow of salt in the daytime
and a pillow of fire at night The sketch
of Moses is equally unhistoric Mosses
was an Egyptian He lived in an ark
made of bullrushes and he kept a golden
calf and worshipped braizen snakes and
et nothing but kwales and manna for forty
years He was caught by the hair of his
head while riding under the bough of a
tree and he was killed by his son Absalom
as he was hanging from the bough But
the ignorance of the schoolboy was quite
equalled by the undergraduate who was
asked Who was the first king of Israel
and was so fortunate as to stumble on
the name of Saul Finding by the face
of the examiner that he had hit upon
the right answer he added confidentially
Saul also called Paul

The American child however managed
to cover a larger space of time in his
confusion when he said Elijah was a good
man who went up to heaven without
dying and threw his cloak down for
Queen Elizabeth to step over

A boy was asked in an examination
What did Moses do with the tabernacle
p 164and he promptly answered He chucked
it out of the camp The scandalised
examiner asked the boy what he meant
and was told that it was so stated in the
Bible On being challenged for the verse
the boy at once repeated And Moses
took the tabernacle and _pitched_ it without
the camp Exod xxxiii 7

The book might be filled with
extraordinary instances of school translation
but room must be found for one beautiful
specimen quoted by Moore in his
_Diary_ A boy having to translate
they ascended by ladders into Latin
turned out this ascendebant per
adolescentiores the comparative degree of
lad _ie_ ladder

The late Mr Barrett Musical Examiner
to the Society of Arts gave some curious
instances of blundering in his report on
the Examinations of 1887 which is printed
in the _Programme of the Societys
Examinations for_ 1888

There were occasional indications that
the terms were misunderstood Presto
signifies turn over Lento with style
Staccato was said to mean stick on
p 165the notes or notes struck and at once
raised

The names of composers in order of
time were generally correctly done but
the particulars concerning the musicians
were rather startling Thus Purcell was
said to have written among other things
an opera called _Ebdon and Eneas_ one
stated that he was born 1543 and died
1595 probably confusing him with Tallis
that he wrote masses and reformed the
church music another that he was the
organist of Kings College Chapel and
wrote madrigals One stated that he was
born 1568 and died 1695 another not
knowing that he had so long passed the
allotted period of mans existence gave
his dates 1693 1685 thus giving him no
limit of existence at all One said he
was a German born somewhere in the
nineteenth century which statement
another confirmed by giving his dates as
18171846 and further credited him
with the composition of _The Woman of
Samaria_ and as having transposed plain
song from tenor to bass Bach is said to
have been the founder of the Thames
p 166School Lipsic the composer of the
_Seasons_ the celebrated writer of opera
comique born 16 and having gone
through an operation for one of his fingers
turned his attention to composition wrote
operas and lastly that he was born in
1756 and died 1880 and that his fame
rests on his passions

The facts about Handel are pretty
correct but we find that Weber wrote
_Parsifal The Flying Dutchman Der Ring
der Nibulengon_ His dates are 18131883
Mendelssohn was born 1770 died 1827
Beethovens dates studied under Hadyn
_sic_ and that he composed many operas
Gounod is said to be a rather modern
musician he wrote _Othello Three Holy
Children_ besides _Faust_ and other works
Among the names given as the composer
of _Nozze di Figaro_ are Donizetti William
Sterndale Bennett Gunod and Sir Mickall
Costa The particulars concerning the
real composer are equally interesting
1 His name is spelt Mozzart Mosarde
etc 2 He was a wellknown Italian wrote
_Medea_ and others 3 His first opera
was _Idumea or Idomeo_ 4 He composed
p 167_Lieder ohne worte Don Pasquale Don
Govianna_ the _Zauberfloat Feuges_ and
his _Requiem_ is the crowning glory of his
marvellious carere 5 He was a
German born 1756 at a very early age
If the dates given by another writer be
true born 1795 died 1659 it is certain
that he must have died before he was
born

Mr Barrett again reported in 1889
some of the strange opinions of those
who came to him to be examined

The answers to the question Who was
Rossini What influence did he exercise
over the art of music in his time brought
to light much curious and interesting
intelligence His nationality was various
He was a German by birth but was born
at Pesaro in Italy he was born in
1670 and died 1826 he was a Frenchman
a noted writer of the French
the place of nativity was Pizzarro in
Genoa he was an Italian and made
people feel drunk with the sparke and
richness of his melody he composed
_Oberon Don Giovanni Der Frieschutz_
and _Stabet Matar_ He was an accomp 168plished
writer of violin music and produced
some of the prettiest melodies
it is to him we owe the extension of
chords struck together in ar peggio he
was the founder of some institution or
another the great aim of his life was
to make the music he wrote an interpretation
of the words it was set to he
broke many of the laws of music he
considerable altered the stage he
was noted for using many instruments
not invented before in his composition
he used the chromatic scale very
much and goes very deep in harmony
he was the first taking up the style and
therefore to make a great change in
music he was the cause of much censure
and bickering through his writings
he promoted a less strict mode of writing
and other beneficial things and finally
Giachono Rossini was born at Pezarro
in 1792 In the year 1774 there was war
raging in Paris between the Gluckists and
Piccinists Gluck wanted to do away with
the old restraint of the Italian aria and
improve opera from a dramatic point of
view Piccini remained true to the old
p 169Italian style and Rossini helped him to
carry it on still further by his operas
_Tancredi William Tell_ and _Dorma del
Lago_ 

The child who gave the following brilliant
answer to the question What was
the character of Queen Mary must
have suffered herself from the troubles
supposed to be connected with the
possession of a stepmother She was wilful
as a girl and cruel as a woman but adds
the pupil what can you expect from any
one who had had five stepmothers

The greatest confusion among the
examined is usually to be found in the
answers to historical and geographical
questions All that one boy knew about
Nelson was that he was buried in
St Pauls Cathedral amid the groans of
a dying nation The student who mixed
up Oliver Cromwell with Thomas Cromwells
master Wolsey produced this strange
answer Oliver Cromwell is said to have
exclaimed as he lay adying If I had
served my God as I served my king He
would not have left me to mine enemies
Miss Graham relates in the _University
p 170Correspondent_ an answer which contains
the same confusion with a further one
added Wolsey was a famous general
who fought in the Crimean War and who
after being decapitated several times said
to Cromwell Ah if I had only served
you as you have served me I would
not have been deserted in my old age
The Spanish Armada wrote a young
man of seventeen took place in the
reign of Queen Anne she married Philip
of Spain who was a very cruel man
The Spanish and the English fought very
bravely against each other The English
wanted to conquer Spain Several battles
were fought in which hundreds of the
English and Spanish were defeated They
lost some very large ships and were at a
great loss on both sides

The following description of the Nile
by a schoolboy is very fine The Nile is
the only remarkable river in the world
It was discovered by Dr Livingstone and
it rises in Mungo Park Constantinople
is described thus It is on the Golden
Horn a strong fortress has a University
and is the residence of Peter the Great
p 171Its chief building is the Sublime Port
Amongst the additions to our geographical
knowledge may be mentioned that Gibraltar
is an island built on a rock and
that Portugal can only be reached through
the St Bernards Pass by means of
sledges drawn by reindeer and dogs
Turin is the capital of China and
Cuba is a town in Africa very difficult
of access

One of the finest answers ever given in
an examination was that of the boy who
was asked to repeat all he knew of Sir
Walter Raleigh This was it He introduced
tobacco into England and while
he was smoking he exclaimed Master
Ridley we have this day lighted such a
fire in England as shall never be put
out  Can that with any sort of justice
be styled a blunder

The rule that the King can do no
wrong was carried to an extreme length
when a schoolboy blunder of Louis XIV
was allowed to change the gender of
a French noun The King said un
carosse and that is what it is now
In Cotgraves _Dictionary carosse_ appears
p 172as feminine but Menage notes it as
having been changed from feminine to
masculine

It has already been pointed out that
some of the blunders of the examined
are due to the absurdity of the questions
of the examiner The following excellent
anecdote from the late Archdeacon Sinclairs
_Sketches of Old Times and Distant
Places_ 1875 shows that even when the
question is sound a difficulty may arise
by the manner of presenting it

I was one day conversing with Dr
Williams about schools and school
examinations He said Let me give you
a curious example of an examination at
which I was present in Aberdeen An
English clergyman and a Lowland Scotsman
visited one of the best parish schools
in that city They were strangers but the
master received them civilly and inquired
Would you prefer that I should _speer_
these boys or that you should _speer_ them
yourselves The English clergyman
having ascertained that to _speer_ meant to
question desired the master to proceed
He did so with great success and the
p 173boys answered numerous interrogatories
as to the Exodus from Egypt The
clergyman then said he would be glad
in his turn to _speer_ the boys and began
How did Pharaoh die There was
a dead silence In this dilemma the
Lowland gentleman interposed I think
sir the boys are not accustomed to your
English accent and inquired in broad
Scotch Hoo did Phawraoh dee Again
there was a dead silence till the master
said I think gentlemen you cant _speer_
these boys Ill show you how And he
proceeded Fat cam to Phawraoh at his
hinder end _ie_ in his latter days The
boys with one voice answered He was
drooned and a smart little fellow added
Ony lassie could hae told you that
The master then explained that in the
Aberdeen dialect to dee means to die
a natural death or to die in bed hence
the perplexity of the boys who knew that
Pharaohs end was very different 

The author is able to add to this chapter
a thoroughly original series of answers to
certain questions relating to acoustics
light and heat which Professor Oliver
p 174Lodge FRS has been so kind as to
communicate for this work and which
cannot fail to be appreciated by his readers
It must be understood that all these answers
are genuine although they are not
given _verbatim et literatim_ and in some
instances one answer is made to contain
several blunders Professor Lodge
expresses the opinion that the questions
might in some instances have been worded
better so as to exclude several of the
misapprehensions and therefore that the
answers may be of some service to future
setters of questions He adds that of late
the South Kensington papers have become
more drearily correct and monotonous
because the style of instruction now
available affords less play to exuberant
fancy untrammelled by any information
regarding the subject in hand


1880ACOUSTICS LIGHT AND HEAT
PAPER

 _Science and Art Department_


The following are specimens of answers
given by candidates at recent examinations
in Acoustics Light and Heat held in
p 175connection with the Science and Art
Department South Kensington The
answers have not of course all been
selected from the same paper neither
have they all been chosen for the same
reason

_Question_ IState the relations existing
between the pressure temperature and
density of a given gas How is it proved
that when a gas expands its temperature
is diminished

_Answer_Now the answer to the first
part of this question is that the square
root of the pressure increases the square
root of the density decreases and the
absolute temperature remains about the
same but as to the last part of the
question about a gas expanding when its
temperature is diminished I expect I am
intended to say I dont believe a word
of it for a bladder in front of a fire
expands but its temperature is not at all
diminished

_Question_ 2If you walk on a dry path
between two walls a few feet apart you
hear a musical note or ring at each
footstep Whence comes this
p 176

_Answer_This is similar to
phosphorescent paint Once any sound gets
between two parallel reflectors or walls
it bounds from one to the other and
never stops for a long time Hence it is
persistent and when you walk between
the walls you hear the sounds made by
those who walked there before you By
following a muffin man down the passage
within a short time you can hear most
distinctly a musical note or as it is more
properly termed in the question a ring
at every other step

_Question_ 3What is the reason that
the hammers which strike the strings of
a pianoforte are made not to strike the
middle of the strings Why are the bass
strings loaded with coils of wire

_Answer_Because the tint of the clang
would be bad Because to jockey them
heavily

_Question_ 4Explain how to determine
the time of vibration of a given tuning
fork and state what apparatus you would
require for the purpose

_Answer_For this determination I
should require an accurate watch beating
p 177seconds and a sensitive ear I mount the
fork on a suitable stand and then as
the second hand of my watch passes the
figure 60 on the dial I draw the bow
neatly across one of its prongs I wait
I listen intently The throbbing air
particles are receiving the pulsations the
beating prongs are giving up their original
force and slowly yet surely the sound
dies away Still I can hear it but faintly
and with close attention and now only
by pressing the bones of my head against
its prongs Finally the last trace
disappears I look at the time and leave
the room having determined the time of
vibration of the common pitch fork
This process deteriorates the fork
considerably hence a different operation must
be performed on a fork which is only _lent_

_Question_ 6What is the difference
between a real and a virtual image
Give a drawing showing the formation of
one of each kind

_Answer_You see a real image every
morning when you shave You do not
see virtual images at all The only people
who see virtual images are those people
p 178who are not quite right like Mrs A
Virtual images are things which dont
exist I cant give you a reliable drawing
of a virtual image because I never saw
one

_Question_ 8How would you disprove
experimentally the assertion that white
light passing through a piece of coloured
glass acquires colour from the glass What
is it that really happens

_Answer_To disprove the assertion so
repeatedly made that white light passing
through a piece of coloured glass acquires
colour from the glass I would ask the
gentleman to observe that the glass has
just as much colour after the light has
gone through it as it had before That is
what would really happen

_Question_ 11Explain why in order to
cook food by boiling at the top of a high
mountain you must employ a different
method from that used at the sea level

_Answer_It is easy to cook food at the
sea level by boiling it but once you get
above the sea level the only plan is to fry
it in its own fat It is in fact impossible
to boil water above the sea level by any
p 179amount of heat A different method
therefore would have to be employed to
boil food at the top of a high mountain
but what that method is has not yet been
discovered The future may reveal it to
a daring experimentalist

_Question_ 12State what are the
conditions favourable for the formation of dew
Describe an instrument for determining the
dew point and the method of using it

_Answer_This is easily proved from
question 1 A body of gas as it ascends
expands cools and deposits moisture so
if you walk up a hill the body of gas inside
you expands gives its heat to you and
deposits its moisture in the form of dew
or common sweat Hence these are the
favourable conditions and moreover it
explains why you get warm by ascending
a hill in opposition to the wellknown
law of the Conservation of Energy

_Question_ 13On freezing water in a
glass tube the tube sometimes breaks
Why is this An iceberg floats with
1000000 tons of ice above the water
line About how many tons are below
the water line
p 180

_Answer_The water breaks the tube
because of capallarity The iceberg
floats on the top because it is lighter
hence no tons are below the water line
Another reason is that an iceberg cannot
exceed 1000000 tons in weight hence
if this much is above water none is
below Ice is exceptional to all other
bodies except bismuth All other bodies
have 1090 feet below the surface and
2 feet extra for every degree centigrade
If it were not for this all fish would die
and the earth be held in an iron grip

PSWhen I say 1090 feet I mean
1090 feet per second

_Question_ 14If you were to pour a
pound of molten lead and a pound of
molten iron each at the temperature of
its melting point upon two blocks of ice
which would melt the most ice and why

_Answer_This question relates to
diathermancy Iron is said to be a
diathermanous body from _dia_ through and
_thermo_ I heat meaning that it gets heated
through and through and accordingly
contains a large quantity of real heat
Lead is said to be an athermanous body
p 181from _a_ privative and _thermo_ I heat
meaning that it gets heated secretly or in
a latent manner Hence the answer to
this question depends on which will get
the best of it the real heat of the iron or
the latent heat of the lead Probably the
iron will smite furthest into the ice as
molten iron is white and glowing while
melted lead is dull

_Question_ 21A hollow indiarubber ball
full of air is suspended on one arm of a
balance and weighed in air The whole
is then covered by the receiver of an air
pump Explain what will happen as the
air in the receiver is exhausted

_Answer_The ball would expand and
entirely fill the vessell driving out all before
it The balance being of greater density
than the rest would be the last to go but
in the end its inertia would be overcome
and all would be expelled and there would
be a perfect vacuum The ball would
then burst but you would not be aware of
the fact on account of the loudness of a
sound varying with the density of the place
in which it is generated and not on that
in which it is heard
p 182

_Question_ 27Account for the delicate
shades of colour sometimes seen on the
inside of an oyster shell State and
explain the appearance presented when a
beam of light falls upon a sheet of glass
on which very fine equidistant parallel
lines have been scratched very close to
one another

_Answer_The delicate shades are due
to putrefaction the colours always show
best when the oyster has been a bad one
Hence they are considered a defect and
are called chromatic aberration

The scratches on the glass will arrange
themselves in rings round the light as any
one may see at night in a tram car

_Question_ 29Show how the hypothenuse
face of a rightangled prism may be
used as a reflector What connection is
there between the refractive index of a
medium and the angle at which an emergent
ray is totally reflected

_Answer_Any face of any prism may
be used as a reflector The connexion
between the refractive index of
a medium and the angle at which an
emergent ray does not emerge but is
p 183totally reflected is remarkable and not
generally known

_Question_ 32Why do the inhabitants
of cold climates eat fat How would you
find experimentally the relative quantities
of heat given off when equal weights of
sulphur phosphorus and carbon are
thoroughly burned

_Answer_An inhabitant of cold climates
called Frigid Zoans eats fat principally
because he cant get no lean also because
he wants to rise is temperature But if
equal weights of sulphur phosphorus and
carbon are burned in his neighbourhood
he will give off eating quite so much The
relative quantities of eat given off will
depend upon how much sulphur etc is
burnt and how near it is burned to him
If I knew these facts it would be an easy
sum to find the answer

_Question_ 1Sound is said to travel
about four times as fast in water as in air
How has this been proved State your
reasons for thinking whether sound travels
faster or slower in oil than in water
p 184

_Answer__a_Mr Colladon a gentleman
who happened to have a boat wrote to a
friend called Mr Sturm to borrow another
boat and row out on the other side of the
lake first providing himself with a large
eartrumpet Mr Colladon took a large
bell weighing some tons which he put
under water and hit furiously Every time
he hit the bell he lit a fusee and Mr
Sturm looked at his watch In this way
it was found out as in the question

It was also done by Mr Byott who sang
at one end of the water pipes of Paris
and a friend at the other end on whom he
could rely heard the song as if it were a
chorus part coming through the water and
part through the air

_b_ This is done by one person going into
a hall  a well and making a noise and
another person stays outside and listens
where the sound comes from When Miss
Beckwith saves life from drowning her
brother makes a noise under water and
she hearing the sound some time after can
calculate where he is and dives for him
and what Miss Beckwith can do under
water of course a mathematician can do
p 185on dry land Hence this is how it is
done

If oil is poured on the water it checks
the soundwaves and puts you out

_Question_ 2What would happen if
two soundwaves exactly alike were to
meet one another in the open air moving
in opposite directions

_Answer_If the soundwaves which
meet in the open air had not come from
the same source they would not recognise
each others existence but if they had they
would embrace and mutually hold fast in
other words interfere with and destroy
each other

_Question_ 9Describe any way in
which the velocity of light has been
measured

_Answer_ _a_A distinguished but
Heathen philosopher Homer was the first
to discover this He was standing one day
at one side of the earth looking at Jupiter
when he conjectured that he would take
16 minutes to get to the other side
This conjecture he then verified by careful
experiment Now the whole way across
the earth is 3072000 miles and dividing
p 186this by 16 we get the velocity 192000
miles a second This is so great that it
would take an express train 40 years to
do it and the bullet from a canon over
5000 years

PSI think the gentlemans name was
Romer not Homer but anyway he was
20 wrong and Mr Fahrenheit and Mr
Celsius afterwards made more careful
determinations

_b_ An Atheistic Scientist falsely so
called tried experiments on the Satellites
of Jupiter He found that he could
delay the eclipse 16 minutes by going to
the other side of the earths orbit in fact
he found he could make the eclipse
happen when he liked by simply shifting
his position Finding that credit was
given him for determining the velocity
of light by this means he repeated it
so often that the calendar began to
get seriously wrong and there were
riots and Pope Gregory had to set things
right

_Question_ 10Explain why water pipes
burst in cold weather

_Answer_People who have not studied
p 187Acoustics think that Thor bursts the pipes
but we know that it is nothing of the kind
for Professor Tyndall has burst the
mythologies and has taught us that it is the
natural behaviour of water and bismuth
without which all fish would die and the
earth be held in an iron grip



CHAPTER VIII

FOREIGNERS ENGLISH

IT is not surprising that foreigners
should make mistakes when
writing in English and Englishmen
who know their own deficiencies in
this respect are not likely to be
censorious when foreigners fall into these
blunders But when information is printed
for the use of Englishmen one would
think that the only wise plan was to have
the composition revised by one who is
thoroughly acquainted with the language
That this natural precaution is not always
taken we have ample evidence Thus at
Havre a polyglot announcement of certain
local regulations was posted in the harbour
and the notice stood as follows in French
Un arrangement peut se faire avec le
pilote pour de promenades a rames The
following very strange translation into
p 189English appeared below the French
One arrangement can make himself
with the pilot for the walking with roars

The papers distributed at international
exhibitions are often very oddly worded
Thus an agent in the French court of
one of these who described himself as
an Ancient Commercial Dealer stated
on a handbill that being appointed by
Tenants of the Exhibition to sell Show
Cases Frames c which this Court
incloses I have the honour to inform
Museum Collectors Librarians Builders
Shopkeepers and business persons in
general that the fixed prices will hardly be
the real value of the Glasses which adorn
them

In 1864 was published in Paris a
pretentious work consisting of notices of
the various literary and scientific societies
of the world which positively swarms with
blunders in the portion devoted to England
The new forms into which wellknown
names are transmogrified must be seen to
be believed Wadham College is printed
_Washam_ Warwick as _Worwick_ and one
of our metropolitan parks is said to be
p 190dedicated to a saint whose name does
not occur in any calendar viz _St Jams
Park_ There is the old confusion respecting
English titles which foreigners
find so difficult to understand and
monsieur and esquire usually appear
respectively before and after the names of
the same persons The Christian names
of knights and baronets are omitted so
that we obtain such impossible forms as
Sir Brown

The book is arranged geographically
and in all cases the English word shire
is omitted with the result that we come
upon such an extremely curious monster
as le Comte de Shrop

On the very first page is made the
extraordinary blunder of turning the Cambrian
Archaeological Association into a _Cambridge_
Society while the Parker Society
whose publications were printed at the
University Press is entered under
_Canterbury_ It is possible that the Latin name
_Cantabrigia_ has originated this mistake
The Roxburgh Society although its
foundation after the sale of the magnificent
library of the Duke of Roxburgh is corp 191rectly
described is here placed under the
county of Roxburgh The most amusing
blunder however in the whole book is
contained in the following charmingly
naive piece of etymology _a propos_ of the
Geological and Polytechnic Society of the
West Riding of Yorkshire On sait quen
Anglais le mot _Ride_ se traduit par
voyage a cheval ou en voiture on pourrait
peutetre penser des le debut quil sagit
dune Societe hippique II nen est rien
a lexemple de lAssociation Britannique
dont elle etc This pairs off well with
the translation of _Walker London_ given
on a previous page

The Germans find the same difficulty
with English titles that the French do
and confuse the Sir at the commencement
of our letters with Herr or Monsieur
Thus they frequently address Englishmen
as _Sir_ instead of mister or esquire We
have an instance of this in a publication
of no less a learned body than the Royal
Academy of Sciences of Munich who
issued in 1860 a Rede auf Sir Thomas
Babington Macaulay

An hotelkeeper at Bale translated
p 192limonade gazeuse as gauze lemonads
and the following delightful entry
is from the Travellers Book of the Drei
Mohren Hotel at Augsburg under date
Jan 28th 1815 His Grace Arthur
Wellesley Duke of Wellington c c
c Great honour arrived at the beginning
of this year to the three Moors This
illustrious warrior whose glorious
atchievements which cradled in Asia have filled
Europe with his renown descended in it
It may be thought that as this is not
printed but only written it is scarcely fair
to preserve it here but it really is too
good to leave out

The keepers of hotels are great sinners
in respect to the manner in which they
murder the English language The following
are a few samples of this form of
literature and most readers will recall
others that they have come across in their
travels

The first is from Salzburg

George Nelbock begs leave to recommand
his hotel to the Three Allied situated
_visavis_ of the birth house of Mozart which
offers all comforts to the meanest charges
p 193

The next notice comes from Rastadt

 ADVICE OF AN HOTEL


The underwritten has the honour of
informing the publick that he has made
the acquisition of the hotel to the Savage
well situated in the middle of this city
He shall endeavour to do all duties which
gentlemen travellers can justly expect
and invites them to please to convince
themselves of it by their kind lodgings at
his house

 BASIL
 JA SINGESEM

 Before the tenant of the Hotel to
 the Stork in this city


Whatever may be the ambition of mine
host at Pompeii it can scarcely be the
fame of an English scholar

 Restorative Hotel Fine Hok
 Kept by Frank Prosperi
 Facing the military quarter
 at Pompei

That hotel open since a very few days is
renowned for the cheapness of the Apartp 194ments
and linen for the exactness of the
service and for the excellence of the true
French cookery Being situated at proximity
of that regeneration it will be propitious
to receive families whatever which
will desire to reside alternatively into that
town to visit the monuments now found
and to breathe thither the salubrity of the
air That establishment will avoid to all
travellers visitors of that sepult city and
to the artists willing draw the antiquities
a great disorder occasioned by tardy and
expensive contour of the iron whay people
will find equally thither a complete sortment
of stranger wines and of the kingdom
hot and cold baths stables coach houses
the whole at very moderated prices Now
all the applications and endeavours of the
Hoste will tend always to correspond to
the tastes and desires of their customers
which will require without doubt to him
into that town the reputation whome he
is ambitious

On the occasion of the Universal
Exhibition of Barcelona in 1888 the _Moniteur
de lExposition_ printed a description of
Barcelona in French German Spanish
p 195and English The latter is so good that
it is worthy of being printed in full

Then there will be in the same Barcelona
the first universal Exposition of
Spain It was not possible to choose a
more favorable place for the capital
town of Catalonia is a firstrate city open
to civilization

It is quite out of possibility to deny it
to be the industrial and commercial capital
of the peninsula and a universal Exposition
could not possibly meet in any other
place a more lively splendour than in this
magnificent town

Indeed what may want Barcelona to
deserve to be called great and handsome
Are here not to be found archeological
and architectural riches whose specimens
are inexhaustible

What are then those churches whose
style it is impossible to find elsewhere
containing altars embellished with truly
spanish magnificence and so large and
imposing cloisters that there feels any
man himself exceedingly small and little
What those shaded promenades where
the sun cannot almost get through with
p 196the golden tinge of its rays what this
Rambla where every good citizen of
Barcelona must take his walk at least
once every day in order to accomplish the
civic pilgrimage of a true Catalanian

And that Paseo Colon so picturesque
with its palmtrees and electric light
which makes it like in the evening a
theatrical decoration and whose ornament
has been very happily just finished

And that statue of Christopher
Colomb whose installation will be
accomplished in a very short time whose price
may be 500000 francs

Are not there still a number of proud
buildings richly ornamented and splendid
theaters one of them perhaps the
most beautiful surely the largest it
contains 5000 places the Liceo is truly
a masterpiece where the spectators are
lost in admiration of the riches the
ornaments the pictures and feel a true
regret to turn their eyes from them to
look at the stage

You will see coffee houses where have
been spent hundreds of thousands to
change their large rooms in enchanted
p 197halls with which it would be difficult to
contest even for the palaces of east

And still in those little streets now
very few so narrow that the inhabitants
of their opposite houses can shake hands
together do you not know that doors
may be found which open to yards and
staircases worthy of palaces

Do you not know there are plenty of
sculptures every one of them masterpieces
and that especially the town
and deputation house contain some halls
which would make meditate all our great
masters

If we walk through the Catalonia
square to reach the Ensanche our
astonishment becomes still greater

In this Ensanche a newlyborn but
already a great town there are no streets
there are but promenades with trees on
both sides which not only moderate the
rays of the sun through their follage but
purify the surrounding atmosphere and
seem to say to those who are walking
beneath their shade You are breathing
here the purest air

There display the houses plenty of
p 198the rarest sorts of marble Out and
indoors rules marble the ceilings of the
halls the staircases the yards command
and force admiration to the spectator
who thought to see only houses and finds
monumental buildings

Join to that a Paseo de Gracia with
immense perspective the promenade of
Cortes 10 kil long some free squares
by day and nighttime in which the rarest
plants and the sweetest flowers enchant
the passengers eyes and enbalm his
smell

Join lastly the neighbourhoods but a
short way from the town and put on all
sides in communication with it by means
of tramwayslines and steamtramways
too those places show a very charming
scenery for every one who likes natural
beauties mingled with those which are
created by the genius of man

After that all there is Monjuich whose
proud fortress seems to say I protect
Barcelona halfway the slope of the
mountain there are Miramar Vista
Alegre which afford one of the grandest
panorama in the world on the left side
p 199the horizon skirting some hills which
form a girdle whose indented tops detach
them selves from an everblue sky at
the foot of those mountains the suburbs
we have already mentioned created for
the rest and enjoyment of man after his
accomplished duty and finished work
on the lowest skirt Barcelona in a flame
with its great buildings steeples towers
houses ornamented with flat terraces and
more than all that its haven which had
been to say so conquered over the
Mediterranean and harbors daily in itself
a large number of ships

All this ideal Whole is concentrated
beneath an enchanting sky almost as
beautiful as the sky of Italy The climate
of Barcelona is very much like Nice the
pretty

Winter is here unknown in its place
there rules a spring which allows every
plant to bud every most delicate flower
to blossom orangetrees and roses throughout
the whole year

In one word Barcelona is a magnificent
town which is about to offer to the
world a splendid universal Exposition
p 200whose success is quite out of doubt
determined

At the Paris Exhibition of 1889 a
_Practical Guide_ was produced for the
benefit of the English visitor which is
written throughout in the most astonishing
jargon as may be seen from the
opening sentences of the Note of the
Editor which run as follows The
Universal Exhibition for whom who comes
there for the first time is a true chaos
in which it is impossible to direct and
recognize ones self without a guide
What wants the stranger the visitor who
comes to the Exhibition it is a means
which permits him to see all without
losing uselessly his time in the most part
vain researches

This is the account of the first
conception of the Exhibition Who was
giving the idea of the Exhibition The
first idea of an Exhibition of the
Centenary belongs in reality not to anybody
It was in the air since several years when
divers newspapers in 1883 bethought
them to consecrate several articles to it
and so it became a serious matter The
p 201period of incubation brooding lasted
since 1883 till the month of March 1884
when they considered the question they
preoccupied them but about a National
Exhibition Afterwards the ambition
increased The ministery then presided
by Mr Jules Ferry thought that if they
would give to this commercial and industrial
manifestation an international character
they would impose the peace not
only to France but to the whole world

The Eiffel Tower gives occasion for
some particularly fine writing In order
to attire the stranger to create a great
attraction which assured the success of
the Exhibition it wanted something
exceptional unrivalled extraordinary An
engineer presented him Mr Eiffel already
known by his considerable and keen
works He proposed to M Locroy to
erect a tower in iron which reaching the
height of three hundred metres would
represent at the industrial sight the
resultant of the modern progresses M
Locroy reflected and accepted Hardly
twenty years ago this project would have
appeared fantastic and impossible The
p 202state of the science of the iron
constructions was not advanced enough the
security given by the calculations was not
yet assured today they know where
they are going they are able to count the
force of the wind The resistance which
the iron opposes to it Mr Eiffel came
at the proper time and nevertheless how
many people have prophetized that the
tower would never been constructed
How many critics have fallen upon this
audacious project It was erected
however and one perceives it from all Paris
it astonishes and lets in extasy the
strangers who come to contemplate it

The figures attached to the fountain
under the tower are comically described
as follows

Europe under the lines of a woman
leaned upon a printing press to print and
a book seems deeped in reflections

America is young woman energetic and
virginal however characterising the youth
and the audacies of the American people

Asia the cradle of the human kind
represents the volupty and the sensualism
Her posture the expression of her figure
p 203render well the abandonment of the passion
with the oriental people

Africa represented by a figure of a
woman in a timid attitude is well the
symbol of the savage people enslaved by
the civilisation

Australia finally is figured by a woman
buttressed on herself like an animal not
yet tamed ready to throw itself on its
prey without waiting to be attacked   

Above Asia and Africa the Love and
the Sleep in the shade of a floating
drapery Finally between Europe and
America a young girl symbolises the
History

The author commences the account
of his first walk as follows Thus we
begin at present as we have let him see
these two wonderworks which fly at the
eyes the Tower and the fountain to return
on his steps to retake with order this walk
of recognition which will permit him
thanks to our watchfulness to see all in
a short time

The History of the human dwelling
is introduced thus It is the moment
or never to walk among the surprising
p 204restitution of which M Garnier the
eminent architect of the Opera has made
him the promoter On our left going
along the flowerbeds from the Tower till
here the constructions of the History of
the human Dwelling is unfolded to our
eyes The human Dwelling in all countries
and in all times there is certainly
an excellent subject of study Without
doubt the great works do not fail where
conscientious plates enable us to know
exactly in which condition where living
our ancestors how their dwellings where
disposed in the interior But nothing
approaches the demonstration by the
materiality of the fact and it is struck
with this truth that the organisators of
the Exhibition resolved to erect an
improvisated town including houses of all
countries and all latitudes

The author finishes up his little work
in the same selfsatisfied manner which
shows how unconscious he was that he
was writing rubbish

There is finished our common walk
and in a happy way after six days which
we dare believe it did not seem to you
p 205long and tiresome your curiosity finding
a constant aliment at every step which we
made you do in this exhibition without
rivalry where the beauties succeed to
the beauties where one leaves not one
pleasure but for a new one As for us
our task of cicerone is too agreeable
to us that we shall do our best to
retain you still near us in efforcing us
to discover still other spectacles and to
present you them after all those you
know already

If it be absurd to give information to
Englishmen in a queer jargon which it is
difficult for him to understand what must
be said of those who attempt to teach a
language of which they are profoundly
ignorant Most of us can call to mind
instances of exceedingly unidiomatic
sentences which have been presented to
our notice in foreign conversation books
but certainly the most extraordinary of
this class of blunders are to be found in
the _New Guide of the Conversation in
Portuguese and English_ by J de Fonseca
and P Carolino which created some
stir in the English press a few years
p 206ago14 The authors do not appear to
have had even the most distant acquaintance
with either the spoken or written
language so that many of the sentences
are positively unintelligible although
the origin of many of them may be
found in a literal translation of certain
French sentences One chapter of this
wonderful book is devoted to _Idiotisms_
which is a singularly appropriate title
for such odd English proverbs as the
following


 14 A selection from this book was printed by
Messrs Field  Tuer under the title of _English
as she is spoke_



The necessity dont know the low

To build castles in Espaguish

So many go the jar to spring than at
last rest there

A little further on we find another
version of this wellknown proverb So
much go the jar to spring that at last it
break there

The stone as roll not heap up not
foam

He is beggar as a church rat

To come back at their muttons
p 207

Tell me whom thou frequent I will
tell you which you are

The apparently incomprehensible sentence
He sin in trouble water is explained
by the fact that the translator
confused the two French words _pecher_
to sin and _pecher_ to fish

The classification adopted by the
authors cannot be considered as very
scientific The only colours catalogued
are _white cray gridelin musk_ and _red_
the only musics instruments_a
flagelet a dreum_ and a _hurdygurdy_
Common stones appear to be _loadstones
brick white lead_ and _gumstone_
But probably the list of Chastisements
is one of the funniest things in this Guide
to Conversation The list contains _a fine
honourable fine to break upon to tear off
the flesh to draw to four horses_

The anecdotes chosen for the instruction
of the unfortunate Portuguese youth are
almost more unintelligible than the rest
of the book and probably the following
two anecdotes could not be matched in
any other printed book

The Commander Forbin of Janson
p 208being at a repast with a celebrated
Boileau had undertaken to pun upon
her nameWhat name told him carry
you thither Boileau I would wish
better to call me Drink wine The poet
was answered him in the same tune
And you sir what name have you choice
Janson I should prefer to be named
Johnmeal The meal dont is valuable
better than the furfur

The next is as good

Plato walking ones self a day to the
field with some of their friends They
were to see him Diogenes who was in
water untill the chin The superficies
of the water was snowed for the rescue
of the hole that Diogenes was made
Dont look it more told them Plato and
he shall get out soon

A large volume entitled _Poluglossos_ was
published in Belgium in 1841 which is
even more misleading and unintelligible
than the Portuguese School Book The
English vocabulary contains some amazing
words such as _agridulce ales of troops
ancientness sign bivacq fire breasts pellicule
chimney black money infatuated compass
p 209iug_ vocal _window umbrella_ etc At
the end of this vocabulary are these
notes

Look the abridged introduction
exeptless for the english editions foregoing
the french postcript next after the title
page Just as the numbers the names
of cities states seas mountains and
rivers the christian names of men and
woman and several synonimous who
enter into the composition of many
english words suppressed in the former
vocabulary are explained by the respective
categorys and appointed at the general
index look also by these what is not
found here above

_Version alternative_ See for the shorter
introduction exeptless for the english
editions foregoing the french postscript
next after the title page Just as the
numbers c    their expletives are
be given by the respective categorys and
appointed at the general index to wich
is sent back

We are frequently told that foreigners
are much better educated than we are
and that the trade of the world is slipping
p 210through our fingers because we are not
taught languages as the foreigners are
This may be so but one cannot help
believing that the dullest of English
clerks would be able to hold his own
in competition with the ingenious youths
who are taught foreign languages on the
system adopted by Senhors Fonseca
and Carolino and by the compiler of
_Poluglossos_

Guides to a foreign town or country
written in English by a foreigner are
often very misleading in fact sometimes
quite incomprehensible A contributor
to the _Notes and Queries_ sent to that
periodical some amusing extracts from a
Guide to Amsterdam The following few
lines from a description of the Assize
Court give a fair idea of the language

The forefront has a noble and sublime
aspect and is particularly characteristical
to what it ought to represent It
is built in a division of three fronts in
the corinthic order each of them consists
of four raising columns resting upon a
general basement from the one end of
the forefront to the other and supporting
p 211a cornish equalling running all over the
face15


 15 _Notes and Queries_ First Series iii 347



When it was known that Louis XVIII
was to be restored to the throne of France
a report was circulated that the Duke of
Clarence afterwards William IV would
take the command of the vessel which was
to convey the king to Calais The people
of that town were in a fever of expectation
and having decided to sing _God save
the King_ in honour of their English visitor
they thought that it would be an additional
compliment if they supplemented it with
an entirely new verse which ran as
follows

 God save noble Clarence
 Who brings our King to France
 God save Clarence
 He maintains the glory
 Of the British navy
 Oh God make him happy
 God save Clarence16


 16 _Ibid_ iv 131


In continuation of the story it may be
said that the Duke did not go to Calais
p 212and that therefore the anthem was not
sung

The composer of this strange verse
succeeded in making pretty fair English
even if his rhymes were somewhat deficient
in correctness This was not the case
with a rather famous inscription made by
a Frenchman Monsieur Girardin who
inscribed a stone at Ermenonville in
memory of our once famous poet Shenstone
was not stupid but rather preternaturally
clever This inscription is
above all praise for the remarkable manner
in which the rhymes appeal to the eye
instead of the ear and moreover it shows
how worldfamous was that charming
garden at Leasowes near Halesowen
which is now only remembered by the
few


 This plain stone
 To William Shenstone
 In his writings he displays
 A mind natural
 At Leasowes he laid
 Arcadian greens rural



Dr Moore having on a certain occasion
excused himself to a Frenchman for using
p 213an expression which he feared was not
French received the reply Bon monsieur
mais il merite bien de letre Of these
lines it is impossible to paraphrase this
polite answer for we cannot say that they
deserve to be English

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
