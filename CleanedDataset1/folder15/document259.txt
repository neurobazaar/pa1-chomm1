To the Man of the High North


 My rhymes are rough and often in my rhyming
 Ive drifted silversailed on seas of dream
 Hearing afar the bells of Elfland chiming
 Seeing the groves of Arcadie agleam

 I was the thrall of Beauty that rejoices
 From peak snowdiademed to regal star
 Yet to mine aerie ever pierced the voices
 The pregnant voices of the Things That Are

 The Here the Now the vast Forlorn around us
 The golddelirium the ferine strife
 The lusts that lure us on the hates that hound us
 Our red rags in the patchwork quilt of Life

 The nameless men who nameless rivers travel
 And in strange valleys greet strange deaths alone
 The grim intrepid ones who would unravel
 The mysteries that shroud the Polar Zone

 These will I sing and if one of you linger
 Over my pages in the Long Long Night
 And on some lone line lay a calloused finger
 Saying Its humantrueit hits me right
 Then will I count this loving toil well spent
 Then will I dream awhilecontent content




Men of the High North


 Men of the High North the wild sky is blazing
 Islands of opal float on silver seas
 Swift splendors kindle barbaric amazing
 Pale ports of amber golden argosies
 Ringed all around us the proud peaks are glowing
 Fierce chiefs in council their wigwam the sky
 Far far below us the big Yukon flowing
 Like threaded quicksilver gleams to the eye

 Men of the High North you who have known it
 You in whose hearts its splendors have abode
 Can you renounce it can you disown it
 Can you forget it its glory and its goad
 Where is the hardship where is the pain of it
 Lost in the limbo of things youve forgot
 Only remain the guerdon and gain of it
 Zest of the foray and God how you fought

 You who have made good you foreign faring
 You money magic to far lands has whirled
 Can you forget those days of vast daring
 There with your soul on the Top o the World
 Nights when no peril could keep you awake on
 Spruce boughs you spread for your couch in the snow
 Taste all your feasts like the beans and the bacon
 Fried at the campfire at forty below

 Can you remember your huskies all going
 Barking with joy and their brushes in air
 You in your parka gladeyed and glowing
 Monarch your subjects the wolf and the bear
 Monarch your kingdom unravisht and gleaming
 Mountains your throne and a river your car
 Crash of a bull moose to rouse you from dreaming
 Forest your couch and your candle a star

 You who this faint day the High North is luring
 Unto her vastness taintlessly sweet
 You who are steelbraced straightlipped enduring
 Dreadless in danger and dire in defeat
 Honor the High North ever and ever
 Whether she crown you or whether she slay
 Suffer her fury cherish and love her
 He who would rule he must learn to obey

 Men of the High North fierce mountains love you
 Proud rivers leap when you ride on their breast
 See the austere sky pensive above you
 Dons all her jewels to smile on your rest
 Children of Freedom scornful of frontiers
 We who are weaklings honor your worth
 Lords of the wilderness Princes of Pioneers
 Lets have a rouse that will ring round the earth




The Ballad of the Northern Lights


 One of the Down and Outthats me Stare at me well ay stare
 Stare and shrinksay you wouldnt think that I was a millionaire
 Look at my face its crimped and gougedone of them deathmask things
 Dont seem the sort of man do I as might be the pal of kings
 Slouching along in smelly rags a blearyeyed nogood bum
 A knight of the hollow needle pard spewed from the sodden slum
 Look me all over from head to foot how much would you think I was worth
 A dollar a dime a nickel Why IM THE WEALTHIEST MAN ON EARTH

 No dont you think that Im off my base Youll sing a different tune
 If only youll let me spin my yarn Come over to this saloon
 Wet my throatits as dry as chalk and seeing as how its you
 Ill tell the tale of a Northern trail and so help me God its true
 Ill tell of the howling wilderness and the haggard Arctic heights
 Of a reckless vow that I made and how I STAKED THE NORTHERN LIGHTS

 Remember the year of the Big Stampede and the trail of Ninetyeight
 When the eyes of the world were turned to the North
 and the hearts of men elate
 Hearts of the old daredevil breed thrilled at the wondrous strike
 And to every man who could hold a pan came the message Up and hike
 Well I was there with the best of them and I knew I would not fail
 You wouldnt believe it to see me now but wait till youve heard my tale

 Youve read of the trail of Ninetyeight but its woe no man may tell
 It was all of a piece and a whole yard wide
 and the name of the brand was Hell
 We heard the call and we staked our all we were plungers playing blind
 And no man cared how his neighbor fared and no man looked behind
 For a ruthless greed was born of need and the weakling went to the wall
 And a curse might avail where a prayer would fail
 and the gold lust crazed us all

 Bold were we and they called us three the Unholy Trinity
 There was Ole Olson the sailor Swede and the Dago Kid and me
 We were the discards of the pack the foreloopers of Unrest
 Reckless spirits of fierce revolt in the ferment of the West
 We were bound to win and we revelled in the hardships of the way
 We staked our ground and our hopes were crowned
 and we hoisted out the pay
 We were rich in a day beyond our dreams
 it was gold from the grassroots down
 But we werent used to such sudden wealth and there was the siren town
 We were crude and careless frontiersmen with much in us of the beast
 We could bear the famine worthily but we lost our heads at the feast

 The town looked mighty bright to us with a bunch of dust to spend
 And nothing was half too good them days and everyone was our friend
 Wining meant more than mining then and life was a dizzy whirl
 Gambling and dropping chunks of gold down the neck of a dancehall girl
 Till we went clean mad it seems to me and we squandered our last poke
 And we sold our claim and we found ourselves one bitter morningbroke

 The Dago Kid he dreamed a dream of his mothers aunt who died
 In the dawnlight dim she came to him and she stood by his bedside
 And she said Go forth to the highest North till a lonely trail ye find
 Follow it far and trust your star and fortune will be kind
 But I jeered at him and then there came the Sailor Swede to me
 And he said I dreamed of my sisters son
 who croaked at the age of three
 From the herded dead he sneaked and said Seek you an Arctic trail
 Tis pale and grim by the Polar rim but seek and ye shall not fail
 And lo that night I too did dream of my mothers sisters son
 And he said to me By the Arctic Sea theres a treasure to be won
 Follow and follow a lone moose trail till you come to a valley grim
 On the slope of the lonely watershed that borders the Polar brim
 Then I woke my pals and soft we swore by the mystic Silver Flail
 Twas the hand of Fate and tomorrow straight
 we would seek the lone moose trail

 We watched the groaning ice wrench free crash on with a hollow din
 Men of the wilderness were we freed from the taint of sin
 The mighty river snatched us up and it bore us swift along
 The days were bright and the morning light was sweet with jewelled song
 We poled and lined up nameless streams portaged oer hill and plain
 We burnt our boat to save the nails and built our boat again
 We guessed and groped North ever North with many a twist and turn
 We saw ablaze in the deathless days the splendid sunsets burn
 Oer soundless lakes where the grayling makes a rush at the clumsy fly
 By bluffs so steep that the hardhit sheep falls sheer from out the sky
 By lilied pools where the bull moose cools and wallows in huge content
 By rocky lairs where the pigeyed bears peered at our tiny tent
 Through the black canyons angry foam we hurled to dreamy bars
 And round in a ring the dognosed peaks bayed to the mocking stars
 Spring and summer and autumn went the sky had a tallow gleam
 Yet North and ever North we pressed to the land of our Golden Dream

 So we came at last to a tundra vast and dark and grim and lone
 And there was the little lone moose trail and we knew it for our own
 By muskeg hollow and niggerhead it wandered endlessly
 Sorry of heart and sore of foot weary men were we
 The shortlived sun had a leaden glare and the darkness came too soon
 And stationed there with a solemn stare was the pinched anaemic moon
 Silence and silvern solitude till it made you dumbly shrink
 And you thought to hear with an outward ear
 the things you thought to think

 Oh it was wild and weird and wan and ever in camp o nights
 We would watch and watch the silver dance of the mystic Northern Lights
 And soft they danced from the Polar sky and swept in primrose haze
 And swift they pranced with their silver feet
 and pierced with a blinding blaze
 They danced a cotillion in the sky they were rose and silver shod
 It was not good for the eyes of mantwas a sight for the eyes of God
 It made us mad and strange and sad and the gold whereof we dreamed
 Was all forgot and our only thought was of the lights that gleamed

 Oh the tundra sponge it was golden brown and some was a bright bloodred
 And the reindeer moss gleamed here and there
 like the tombstones of the dead
 And in and out and around about the little trail ran clear
 And we hated it with a deadly hate and we feared with a deadly fear
 And the skies of night were alive with light
 with a throbbing thrilling flame
 Amber and rose and violet opal and gold it came
 It swept the sky like a giant scythe it quivered back to a wedge
 Argently bright it cleft the night with a wavy golden edge
 Pennants of silver waved and streamed lazy banners unfurled
 Sudden splendors of sabres gleamed lightning javelins were hurled
 There in our awe we crouched and saw with our wild uplifted eyes
 Charge and retire the hosts of fire in the battlefield of the skies

 But all things come to an end at last and the muskeg melted away
 And frowning down to bar our path a muddle of mountains lay
 And a gorge sheered up in granite walls and the moose trail crept betwixt
 Twas as if the earth had gaped too far and her stony jaws were fixt
 Then the winter fell with a sudden swoop and the heavy clouds sagged low
 And earth and sky were blotted out in a whirl of driving snow

 We were climbing up a glacier in the neck of a mountain pass
 When the Dago Kid slipped down and fell into a deep crevasse
 When we got him out one leg hung limp and his brow was wreathed with pain
 And he says Tis badly broken boys and Ill never walk again
 Its death for all if ye linger here and thats no cursed lie
 Go on go on while the trail is good and leave me down to die
 He raved and swore but we tended him with our uncouth clumsy care
 The campfire gleamed and he gazed and dreamed
 with a fixed and curious stare
 Then all at once he grabbed my gun and he put it to his head
 And he says Ill fix it for you boysthem are the words he said

 So we sewed him up in a canvas sack and we slung him to a tree
 And the stars like needles stabbed our eyes and woeful men were we
 And on we went on our woeful way wrapped in a daze of dream
 And the Northern Lights in the crystal nights
 came forth with a mystic gleam
 They danced and they danced the devildance over the naked snow
 And soft they rolled like a tide upshoaled with a ceaseless ebb and flow
 They rippled green with a wondrous sheen they fluttered out like a fan
 They spread with a blaze of rosepink rays never yet seen of man
 They writhed like a brood of angry snakes hissing and sulphur pale
 Then swift they changed to a dragon vast lashing a cloven tail
 It seemed to us as we gazed aloft with an everlasting stare
 The sky was a pit of bale and dread and a monster revelled there

 We climbed the rise of a hogback range that was desolate and drear
 When the Sailor Swede had a crazy fit and he got to talking queer
 He talked of his home in Oregon and the peach trees all in bloom
 And the fern headhigh and the topaz sky and the forests scented gloom
 He talked of the sins of his misspent life and then he seemed to brood
 And I watched him there like a fox a hare for I knew it was not good
 And sure enough in the dim dawnlight I missed him from the tent
 And a fresh trail broke through the crusted snow
 and I knew not where it went
 But I followed it oer the seamless waste and I found him at shut of day
 Naked there as a newborn babeso I left him where he lay

 Day after day was sinister and I fought fierceeyed despair
 And I clung to life and I struggled on I knew not why nor where
 I packed my grub in short relays and I cowered down in my tent
 And the world around was purged of sound like a frozen continent
 Day after day was dark as death but ever and ever at nights
 With a brilliancy that grew and grew blazed up the Northern Lights

 They rolled around with a soundless sound like softly bruised silk
 They poured into the bowl of the sky with the gentle flow of milk
 In eager pulsing violet their wheeling chariots came
 Or they poised above the Polar rim like a coronal of flame
 From depths of darkness fathomless their lancing rays were hurled
 Like the allcombining searchlights of the navies of the world
 There on the roofpole of the world as one bewitched I gazed
 And howled and grovelled like a beast as the awful splendors blazed
 My eyes were seared yet thralled I peered
 through the parka hood nigh blind
 But I staggered on to the lights that shone and never I looked behind

 There is a mountain round and low that lies by the Polar rim
 And I climbed its height in a whirl of light
 and I peered oer its jagged brim
 And there in a crater deep and vast ungained unguessed of men
 The mystery of the Arctic world was flashed into my ken
 For there these poor dim eyes of mine beheld the sight of sights
 That hollow ring was the source and spring of the mystic Northern Lights

 Then I staked that place from crown to base and I hit the homeward trail
 Ah God it was good though my eyes were blurred
 and I crawled like a sickly snail
 In that vast white world where the silent sky
 communes with the silent snow
 In hunger and cold and misery I wandered to and fro
 But the Lord took pity on my pain and He led me to the sea
 And some icebound whalers heard my moan and they fed and sheltered me
 They fed the feeble scarecrow thing that stumbled out of the wild
 With the ravaged face of a mask of death
 and the wandering wits of a child
 A craven cowering bag of bones that once had been a man
 They tended me and they brought me back to the world and here I am

 Some say that the Northern Lights are the glare of the Arctic ice and snow
 And some that its electricity and nobody seems to know
 But Ill tell you nowand if I lie may my lips be stricken dumb
 Its a MINE a mine of the precious stuff that men call radium
 Its a million dollars a pound they say
 and theres tons and tons in sight
 You can see it gleam in a golden stream in the solitudes of night
 And its mine all mineand say if you have a hundred plunks to spare
 Ill let you have the chance of your life Ill sell you a quarter share
 You turn it down Well Ill make it ten seeing as you are my friend
 Nothing doing Say dont be hardhave you got a dollar to lend
 Just a dollar to help me out I know youll treat me white
 Ill do as much for you some day    God bless you sir goodnight




The Ballad of the Black Fox Skin


 There was Clawfingered Kitty and Windy Ike living the life of shame
 When unto them in the Long Long Night came the manwhohadnoname
 Bearing his prize of a black fox pelt out of the Wild he came

 His cheeks were blanched as the flumehead foam
 when the brown spring freshets flow
 Deep in their dark sincalcined pits were his sombre eyes aglow
 They knew him far for the fitful man who spat forth blood on the snow

 Did ever you see such a skin quoth he
 theres nought in the world so fine
 Such fullness of fur as black as the night
 such lustre such size such shine
 Its life to a onelunged man like me its London its women its wine

 The Moosehides called it the devilfox and swore that no man could kill
 That he who hunted it soon or late must surely suffer some ill
 But I laughed at them and their old squawtales
 Ha Ha Im laughing still

 For look ye the skinits as smooth as sin
 and black as the core of the Pit
 By gun or by trap whatever the hap I swore I would capture it
 By star and by star afield and afar I hunted and would not quit

 For the devilfox it was swift and sly and it seemed to fleer at me
 I would wake in fright by the campfire light hearing its evil glee
 Into my dream its eyes would gleam and its shadow would I see

 It sniffed and ran from the ptarmigan I had poisoned to excess
 Unharmed it sped from my wrathful lead twas as if I shot by guess
 Yet it came by night in the stark moonlight to mock at my weariness

 I tracked it up where the mountains hunch like the vertebrae of the world
 I tracked it down to the deathstill pits where the avalanche is hurled
 From the glooms to the sacerdotal snows
 where the carded clouds are curled

 From the vastitudes where the world protrudes
 through clouds like seas upshoaled
 I held its track till it led me back to the land I had left of old
 The land I had looted many moons I was weary and sick and cold

 I was sick soulsick of the futile chase and there and then I swore
 The foul fiend fox might scathless go for I would hunt no more
 Then I rubbed mine eyes in a vast surpriseit stood by my cabin door

 A rifle raised in the wraithlike gloom and a vengeful shot that sped
 A howl that would thrill a creamfaced corpse
 and the demon fox lay dead   
 Yet there was never a sign of wound and never a drop he bled

 So that was the end of the great black fox
 and here is the prize Ive won
 And now for a drink to cheer me upIve mushed since the early sun
 Well drink a toast to the sorry ghost of the fox whose race is run


 II

 Now Clawfingered Kitty and Windy Ike bad as the worst were they
 In their roadhouse down by the rivertrail
 they waited and watched for prey
 With wine and song they joyed night long and they slept like swine by day

 For things were done in the Midnight Sun that no tongue will ever tell
 And men there be who walk earthfree but whose names are writ in hell
 Are writ in flames with the guilty names of Fournier and Labelle

 Put not your trust in a poke of dust would ye sleep the sleep of sin
 For there be those who would rob your clothes ere yet the dawn comes in
 And a prize likewise in a womans eyes is a peerless black fox skin

 Put your faith in the mountain cat if you lie within his lair
 Trust the fangs of the motherwolf and the claws of the leadripped bear
 But oh of the wiles and the goldtooth smiles
 of a dancehall wench beware

 Wherefore it was beyond all laws that lusts of man restrain
 A man drank deep and sank to sleep never to wake again
 And the Yukon swallowed through a hole the cold corpse of the slain


 III

 The black fox skin a shadow cast from the roof nigh to the floor
 And sleek it seemed and soft it gleamed and the woman stroked it oer
 And the man stood by with a brooding eye and gnashed his teeth and swore

 When thieves and thugs fall out and fight theres fell arrears to pay
 And soon or late sin meets its fate and so it fell one day
 That Clawfingered Kitty and Windy Ike fanged up like dogs at bay

 The skin is mine all mine she cried I did the deed alone
 Its share and share with a guiltyoked pair
 he hissed in a pregnant tone
 And so they snarled like malamutes over a mildewed bone

 And so they fought by fear untaught till haply it befell
 One dawn of day she slipped away to Dawson town to sell
 The fruit of sin this black fox skin that had made their lives a hell

 She slipped away as still he lay she clutched the wondrous fur
 Her pulses beat her foot was fleet her fear was as a spur
 She laughed with glee she did not see him rise and follow her

 The bluffs uprear and grimly peer far over Dawson town
 They see its lights a blaze o nights and harshly they look down
 They mock the plan and plot of man with grim ironic frown

 The trail was steep twas at the time when swiftly sinks the snow
 All honeycombed the river ice was rotting down below
 The river chafed beneath its rind with many a mighty throe

 And up the swift and oozy drift a woman climbed in fear
 Clutching to her a black fox fur as if she held it dear
 And hard she pressed it to her breastthen Windy Ike drew near

 She made no moanher heart was stoneshe read his smiling face
 And like a dream flashed all her lifes dark horror and disgrace
 A moment onlywith a snarl he hurled her into space

 She rolled for nigh an hundred feet she bounded like a ball
 From crag to crag she carromed down through snow and timber fall   
 A hole gaped in the river ice the spray flashedthat was all

 A bird sang for the joy of spring so piercing sweet and frail
 And blinding bright the land was dight in gay and glittering mail
 And with a wondrous black fox skin a man slid down the trail


 IV

 A wedgefaced man there was who ran along the river bank
 Who stumbled through each drift and slough and ever slipped and sank
 And ever cursed his Makers name and ever hooch he drank

 He travelled like a hunted thing hard harried sore distrest
 The old grandmother moon crept out from her cloudquilted nest
 The aged mountains mocked at him in their primeval rest

 Grim shadows diapered the snow the air was strangely mild
 The valleys girth was dumb with mirth the laughter of the wild
 The still sardonic laughter of an ogre oer a child

 The river writhed beneath the ice it groaned like one in pain
 And yawning chasms opened wide and closed and yawned again
 And sheets of silver heaved on high until they split in twain

 From out the roadhouse by the trail they saw a man afar
 Make for the narrow riverreach where the swift crosscurrents are
 Where frail and worn the ice is torn and the angry waters jar

 But they did not see him crash and sink into the icy flow
 They did not see him clinging there gripped by the undertow
 Clawing with bleeding fingernails at the jagged ice and snow

 They found a note beside the hole where he had stumbled in
 Here met his fate by evil luck a man who lived in sin
 And to the one who loves me least I leave this black fox skin

 And strange it is for though they searched the river all around
 No trace or sign of black fox skin was ever after found
 Though one man said he saw the tread of HOOFS deep in the ground




The Ballad of Pious Pete

 _The North has got him_ Yukonism


 I tried to refine that neighbor of mine honest to God I did
 I grieved for his fate and early and late I watched over him like a kid
 I gave him excuse I bore his abuse in every way that I could
 I swore to prevail I camped on his trail
 I plotted and planned for his good
 By day and by night I strove in mens sight to gather him into the fold
 With precept and prayer with hope and despair
 in hunger and hardship and cold
 I followed him into Gehennas of sin I sat where the sirens sit
 In the shade of the Pole for the sake of his soul
 I strove with the powers of the Pit
 I shadowed him down to the scrofulous town
 I dragged him from dissolute brawls
 But I killed the galoot when he started to shoot electricity into my walls

 God knows what I did he should seek to be rid
 of one who would save him from shame
 God knows what I bore that night when he swore
 and bade me make tracks from his claim
 I started to tell of the horrors of hell
 when sudden his eyes lit like coals
 And Chuck it says he dont persecute me
 with your cant and your saving of souls
 Ill swear I was mild as Id be with a child
 but he called me the son of a slut
 And grabbing his gun with a leap and a run
 he threatened my face with the butt
 So what could I do I leave it to you With curses he harried me forth
 Then he was alone and I was alone and over us menaced the North

 Our cabins were near I could see I could hear
 but between us there rippled the creek
 And all summer through with a rancor that grew
 he would pass me and never would speak
 Then a shuddery breath like the coming of Death
 crept down from the peaks far away
 The water was still the twilight was chill the sky was a tatter of gray
 Swift came the Big Cold and opal and gold the lights of the witches arose
 The frosttyrant clinched and the valley was cinched
 by the stark and cadaverous snows
 The trees were like lace where the starbeams could chase
 each leaf was a jewel agleam
 The soft white hush lapped the Northland and wrapped
 us round in a crystalline dream
 So still I could hear quite loud in my ear
 the swish of the pinions of time
 So bright I could see as plain as could be
 the wings of Gods angels ashine

 As I read in the Book I would oftentimes look
 to that cabin just over the creek
 Ah me it was sad and evil and bad two neighbors who never would speak
 I knew that full well like a devil in hell
 he was hatching out early and late
 A system to bear through the frostspangled air
 the warm crimson waves of his hate
 I only could peer and shudder and feartwas ever so ghastly and still
 But I knew over there in his lonely despair
 he was plotting me terrible ill
 I knew that he nursed a malice accurst
 like the blast of a winnowing flame
 I pleaded aloud for a shield for a shroudOh God then calamity came

 Mad If Im mad then you too are mad but its all in the point of view
 If youd looked at them things gallivantin on wings
 all purple and green and blue
 If youd noticed them twist as they mounted and hissed
 like scorpions dim in the dark
 If youd seen them rebound with a horrible sound
 and spitefully spitting a spark
 If youd watched IT with dread as it hissed by your bed
 that thing with the feelers that crawls
 Youd have settled the brute that attempted to shoot
 electricity into your walls

 Oh some they were blue and they slithered right through
 they were silent and squashy and round
 And some they were green they were wriggly and lean
 they writhed with so hateful a sound
 My blood seemed to freeze I fell on my knees
 my face was a white splash of dread
 Oh the Green and the Blue they were gruesome to view
 but the worst of them all were the Red
 They came through the door they came through the floor
 they came through the mosscreviced logs
 They were savage and dire they were whiskered with fire
 they bickered like malamute dogs
 They ravined in rings like iniquitous things
 they gulped down the Green and the Blue
 I crinkled with fear wheneer they drew near
 and nearer and nearer they drew

 And then came the crown of Horrors grim crown
 the monster so loathsomely red
 Each eye was a pin that shot out and in as squidlike it oozed to my bed
 So softly it crept with feelers that swept
 and quivered like fine copper wire
 Its belly was white with a sulphurous light
 it jaws were adrooling with fire
 It came and it came I could breathe of its flame
 but never a wink could I look
 I thrust in its maw the Fount of the Law I fended it off with the Book
 I was weakoh so weakbut I thrilled at its shriek
 as wildly it fled in the night
 And deathlike I lay till the dawn of the day
 Was ever so welcome the light

 I loaded my gun at the rise of the sun to his cabin so softly I slunk
 My neighbor was there in the frostfreighted air
 all wrapped in a robe in his bunk
 It muffled his moans it outlined his bones as feebly he twisted about
 His gums were so black and his lips seemed to crack
 and his teeth all were loosening out
 Twas a deaths head that peered through the tangle of beard
 twas a face I will never forget
 Sunk eyes full of woe and they troubled me so
 with their pleadings and anguish and yet
 As I rested my gaze in a misty amaze on the scurvydegenerate wreck
 I thought of the Things with the dragonfly wings
 then laid I my gun on his neck
 He gave out a cry that was faint as a sigh like a perishing malamute
 And he says unto me Im converted says he
 for Christs sake Peter dont shoot

     

 Theyre taking me out with an escort about and under a sergeants care
 I am humbled indeed for Im cuffed to a Swede
 that thinks hes a millionaire
 But its all Gospel true what Im telling to you
 up there where the Shadow falls
 That I settled Sam Noot when he started to shoot electricity into my walls




The Ballad of Blasphemous Bill


 I took a contract to bury the body of blasphemous Bill MacKie
 Whenever wherever or whatsoever the manner of death he die
 Whether he die in the light o day or under the peakfaced moon
 In cabin or dancehall camp or dive mucklucks or patent shoon
 On velvet tundra or virgin peak by glacier drift or draw
 In muskeg hollow or canyon gloom by avalanche fang or claw
 By battle murder or sudden wealth by pestilence hooch or lead
 I swore on the Book I would follow and look till I found my tombless dead

 For Bill was a dainty kind of cuss and his mind was mighty sot
 On a dinky patch with flowers and grass in a civilized boneyard lot
 And where he died or how he died it didnt matter a damn
 So long as he had a grave with frills and a tombstone epigram
 So I promised him and he paid the price in good cheechako coin
 Which the same I blowed in that very night down in the Tenderloin
 Then I painted a threefoot slab of pine Here lies poor Bill MacKie
 And I hung it up on my cabin wall and I waited for Bill to die

 Years passed away and at last one day came a squaw with a story strange
 Of a longdeserted line of traps way back of the Bighorn range
 Of a little hut by the great divide and a white man stiff and still
 Lying there by his lonesome self and I figured it must be Bill
 So I thought of the contract Id made with him
 and I took down from the shelf
 The swell black box with the silver plate hed picked out for hisself
 And I packed it full of grub and hooch and I slung it on the sleigh
 Then I harnessed up my team of dogs and was off at dawn of day

 You know what its like in the Yukon wild when its sixtynine below
 When the iceworms wriggle their purple heads
 through the crust of the pale blue snow
 When the pinetrees crack like little guns in the silence of the wood
 And the icicles hang down like tusks under the parka hood
 When the stovepipe smoke breaks sudden off and the sky is weirdly lit
 And the careless feel of a bit of steel burns like a redhot spit
 When the mercury is a frozen ball and the frostfiend stalks to kill
 Well it was just like that that day when I set out to look for Bill

 Oh the awful hush that seemed to crush me down on every hand
 As I blundered blind with a trail to find
 through that blank and bitter land
 Half dazed half crazed in the winter wild
 with its grim heartbreaking woes
 And the ruthless strife for a grip on life that only the sourdough knows
 North by the compass North I pressed river and peak and plain
 Passed like a dream I slept to lose and I waked to dream again

 River and plain and mighty peakand who could stand unawed
 As their summits blazed he could stand undazed
 at the foot of the throne of God
 North aye North through a land accurst shunned by the scouring brutes
 And all I heard was my own harsh word and the whine of the malamutes
 Till at last I came to a cabin squat built in the side of a hill
 And I burst in the door and there on the floor frozen to death lay Bill

 Ice white ice like a windingsheet sheathing each smokegrimed wall
 Ice on the stovepipe ice on the bed ice gleaming over all
 Sparkling ice on the dead mans chest glittering ice in his hair
 Ice on his fingers ice in his heart ice in his glassy stare
 Hard as a log and trussed like a frog with his arms and legs outspread
 I gazed at the coffin Id brought for him
 and I gazed at the gruesome dead
 And at last I spoke Bill liked his joke but still goldarn his eyes
 A man had ought to consider his mates in the way he goes and dies

 Have you ever stood in an Arctic hut in the shadow of the Pole
 With a little coffin six by three and a grief you cant control
 Have you ever sat by a frozen corpse that looks at you with a grin
 And that seems to say You may try all day but youll never jam me in
 Im not a man of the quitting kind but I never felt so blue
 As I sat there gazing at that stiff and studying what Id do
 Then I rose and I kicked off the husky dogs that were nosing round about
 And I lit a roaring fire in the stove and I started to thaw Bill out

 Well I thawed and thawed for thirteen days but it didnt seem no good
 His arms and legs stuck out like pegs as if they was made of wood
 Till at last I said It aint no usehes froze too hard to thaw
 Hes obstinate and he wont lie straight so I guess I got toSAW
 So I sawed off poor Bills arms and legs and I laid him snug and straight
 In the little coffin he picked hisself with the dinky silver plate
 And I came nigh near to shedding a tear as I nailed him safely down
 Then I stowed him away in my Yukon sleigh and I started back to town

 So I buried him as the contract was in a narrow grave and deep
 And there hes waiting the Great Cleanup
 when the Judgment sluiceheads sweep
 And I smoke my pipe and I meditate in the light of the Midnight Sun
 And sometimes I wonder if they WAS the awful things I done
 And as I sit and the parson talks expounding of the Law
 I often think of poor old BillAND HOW HARD HE WAS TO SAW




The Ballad of OneEyed Mike


 _This is the tale that was told to me by the man with the crystal eye
 As I smoked my pipe in the campfire light
 and the Glories swept the sky
 As the Northlights gleamed and curved and streamed
 and the bottle of hooch was dry_

 A man once aimed that my life be shamed and wrought me a deathly wrong
 I vowed one day I would well repay but the heft of his hate was strong
 He thonged me East and he thonged me West he harried me back and forth
 Till I fled in fright from his peerless spite
 to the bleak baldheaded North

 And there I lay and for many a day I hatched plan after plan
 For a golden haul of the wherewithal to crush and to kill my man
 And there I strove and there I clove through the drift of icy streams
 And there I fought and there I sought for the paystreak of my dreams

 So twenty years with their hopes and fears and smiles and tears and such
 Went by and left me long bereft of hope of the Midas touch
 About as fat as a chancel rat and lo despite my will
 In the weary fight I had clean lost sight of the man I sought to kill

 Twas so far away that evil day when I prayed to the Prince of Gloom
 For the savage strength and the sullen length of life to work his doom
 Nor sign nor word had I seen or heard and it happed so long ago
 My youth was gone and my memory wan and I willed it even so

 It fell one night in the waning light by the Yukons oily flow
 I smoked and sat as I marvelled at the skys portwiney glow
 Till it paled away to an absinthe gray and the river seemed to shrink
 All wobbly flakes and wriggling snakes and goblin eyes awink

 Twas weird to see and it wildered me in a queer hypnotic dream
 Till I saw a spot like an inky blot come floating down the stream
 It bobbed and swung it sheered and hung it romped round in a ring
 It seemed to play in a tricksome way it sure was a merry thing

 In freakish flights strange oily lights came fluttering round its head
 Like butterflies of a monster sizethen I knew it for the Dead
 Its face was rubbed and slicked and scrubbed as smooth as a shaven pate
 In the silver snakes that the water makes it gleamed like a dinnerplate

 It gurgled near and clear and clear and large and large it grew
 It stood upright in a ring of light and it looked me through and through
 It weltered round with a woozy sound and ere I could retreat
 With the witless roll of a sodden soul it wantoned to my feet

 And here I swear by this Cross I wear I heard that floater say
 I am the man from whom you ran the man you sought to slay
 That you may note and gaze and gloat and say Revenge is sweet
 In the grit and grime of the rivers slime I am rotting at your feet

 The ill we rue we must een undo though it rive us bone from bone
 So it came about that I sought you out for I prayed I might atone
 I did you wrong and for long and long I sought where you might live
 And now youre found though Im dead and drowned I beg you to forgive

 So sad it seemed and its cheekbones gleamed
 and its fingers flicked the shore
 And it lapped and lay in a weary way and its hands met to implore
 That I gently said Poor restless dead I would never work you woe
 Though the wrong you rue you can neer undo I forgave you long ago

 Then wonderwise I rubbed my eyes and I woke from a horrid dream
 The moon rode high in the naked sky and something bobbed in the stream
 It held my sight in a patch of light and then it sheered from the shore
 It dipped and sank by a hollow bank and I never saw it more

 _This was the tale he told to me that man so warped and gray
 Ere he slept and dreamed and the campfire gleamed
 in his eye in a wolfish way
 That crystal eye that raked the sky in the weird Auroral ray_




The Ballad of the Brand


 Twas up in a land long famed for gold where women were far and rare
 Tellus the smith had taken to wife a maiden amazingly fair
 Tellus the brawny worker in iron hairy and heavy of hand
 Saw her and loved her and bore her away from the tribe of a Southern land
 Deeming her worthy to queen his home and mother him little ones
 That the name of Tellus the master smith might live in his stalwart sons

 Now there was little of law in the land and evil doings were rife
 And every man who joyed in his home guarded the fame of his wife
 For there were those of the silver tongue and the honeyed art to beguile
 Who would cozen the heart from a womans breast
 and damn her soul with a smile
 And there were women too quick to heed a look or a whispered word
 And once in a while a man was slain and the ire of the King was stirred
 So far and wide he proclaimed his wrath and this was the law he willed
 That whosoever killeth a man even shall he be killed

 Now Tellus the smith he trusted his wife his heart was empty of fear
 High on the hill was the gleam of their hearth a beacon of love and cheer
 High on the hill they builded their bower
 where the broom and the bracken meet
 Under a grave of oaks it was hushed and drowsily sweet
 Here he enshrined her his dearest saint his idol the light of his eye
 Her kisses rested upon his lips as brushes a butterfly
 The weight of her arms around his neck was light as the thistle down
 And sweetly she studied to win his smile and gently she mocked his frown
 And when at the close of the dusty day his clangorous toil was done
 She hastened to meet him down the way all lit by the amber sun

 Their dovecot gleamed in the golden light a temple of stainless love
 Like the hanging cup of a big blue flower was the topaz sky above
 The roses and lilies yearned to her
 as swift through their throng she pressed
 A little white fragile fluttering thing
 that lay like a child on his breast
 Then the heart of Tellus the smith was proud
 and sang for the joy of life
 And there in the bronzing summertide he thanked the gods for his wife

 Now there was one called Philo a scribe a man of exquisite grace
 Carved like the god Apollo in limb fair as Adonis in face
 Eager and winning in manner full of such radiant charm
 Womenkind fought for his favor and loved to their uttermost harm
 Such was his craft and his knowledge such was his skill at the game
 Never was woman could flout him so be he plotted her shame
 And so he drank deep of pleasure and then it fell on a day
 He gazed on the wife of Tellus and marked her out for his prey

 Tellus the smith was merry and the time of the year it was June
 So he said to his stalwart helpers Shut down the forge at noon
 Go ye and joy in the sunshine rest in the coolth of the grove
 Drift on the dreamy river every man with his love
 Then to himself Oh Beloved sweet will be your surprise
 Today will we sport like children laugh in each others eyes
 Weave gay garlands of poppies crown each other with flowers
 Pull plump carp from the lilies rifle the ferny bowers
 Today with feasting and gladness the wine of Cyprus will flow
 Today is the day we were wedded only a twelvemonth ago

 The larks trilled high in the heavens his heart was lyric with joy
 He plucked a posy of lilies he sped like a lovesick boy
 He stole up the velvety pathwayhis cottage was sunsteeped and still
 Vines honeysuckled the window softly he peeped oer the sill
 The lilies dropped from his fingers devils were choking his breath
 Rigid with horror he stiffened ghastly his face was as death
 Like a nun whose faith in the Virgin is met with a prurient jibe
 He shranktwas the wife of his bosom in the arms of Philo the scribe

 Tellus went back to his smithy he reeled like a drunken man
 His heart was riven with anguish his brain was brooding a plan
 Straight to his anvil he hurried started his furnace aglow
 Heated his iron and shaped it with savage and masterful blow
 Sparks showered over and round him swiftly under his hand
 There at last it was finisheda hideous and infamous Brand

 That night the wife of his bosom the light of joy in her eyes
 Kissed him with words of rapture but he knew that her words were lies
 Never was she so beguiling never so merry of speech
 For passion ripens a woman as the sunshine ripens a peach
 He clenched his teeth into silence he yielded up to her lure
 Though he knew that her breasts were heaving from the fire of her paramour
 Tomorrow he said tomorrowhe wove her hair in a strand
 Twisted it round his fingers and smiled as he thought of the Brand

 The morrow was come and Tellus swiftly stole up the hill
 Butterflies drowsed in the noonheat coverts were sunsteeped and still
 Softly he padded the pathway unto the porch and within
 Heard he the low laugh of dalliance heard he the rapture of sin
 Knew he her eyes were mystic with light that no man should see
 No man kindle and joy in no man on earth save he
 And never for him would it kindle The bloodlust surged in his brain
 Through the senseless stone could he see them wanton and warily fain
 Horrible Heaven he sought for gained it and gloried and fell
 Oh it was suddenheadlong into the nethermost hell   

 Was this he Tellus this marble Tellus    not dreaming a dream
 Ah sharpedged as a javelin was that a womans scream
 Was it a door that shattered shelllike under his blow
 Was it his saint that strumpet dishevelled and cowering low
 Was it her lover that wild thing that twisted and gouged and tore
 Was it a man he was crushing whose head he beat on the floor
 Laughing the while at its weakness till sudden he stayed his hand
 Through the red ring of his madness flamed the thought of the Brand

 Then bound he the naked Philo with thongs that cut in the flesh
 And the wife of his bosom fearfrantic he gagged with a silken mesh
 Choking her screams into silence bound her down by the hair
 Dragged her lover unto her under her frenzied stare
 In the heat of the hearthfire embers he heated the hideous Brand
 Twisting her fingers open he forced its haft in her hand
 He pressed it downward and downward she felt the living flesh sear
 She saw the throe of her lover she heard the scream of his fear
 Once twice and thrice he forced her heedless of prayer and shriek
 Once on the forehead of Philo twice in the soft of his cheek
 Then for the thing was finished he said to the woman See
 How you have branded your lover Now will I let him go free
 He severed the thongs that bound him laughing Revenge is sweet
 And Philo sobbing in anguish feebly rose to his feet
 The man who was fair as Apollo godlike in womans sight
 Hideous now as a satyr fled to the pity of night

 _Then came they before the Judgment Seat
 and thus spoke the Lord of the Land
 He who seeketh his neighbors wife
 shall suffer the doom of the Brand
 Brutish and bold on his brow be it stamped
 deep in his cheek let it sear
 That every man may look on his shame and shudder and sicken and fear
 He shall hear their mock in the marketplace
 their fleering jibe at the feast
 He shall seek the caves and the shroud of night
 and the fellowship of the beast
 Outcast forever from homes of men far and far shall he roam
 Such be the doom sadder than death of him who shameth a home_




The Ballad of HardLuck Henry


 Now wouldnt you expect to find a man an awful crank
 Thats staked out nigh three hundred claims and every one a blank
 Thats followed every fool stampede and seen the rise and fall
 Of camps where men got gold in chunks and he got none at all
 Thats prospected a bit of ground and sold it for a song
 To see it yield a fortune to some fool that came along
 Thats sunk a dozen bedrock holes and not a speck in sight
 Yet sees them take a million from the claims to left and right
 Now arent things like that enough to drive a man to booze
 But HardLuck Smith was hoodooproofhe knew the way to lose

 Twas in the fall of nineteen fourleapyear Ive heard them say
 When HardLuck came to Hunker Creek and took a hillside lay
 And lo as if to make amends for all the futile past
 Late in the year he struck it rich the real paystreak at last
 The riffles of his sluicingbox were choked with speckled earth
 And night and day he worked that lay for all that he was worth
 And when in chill Decembers gloom his lucky lease expired
 He found that he had made a stake as big as he desired

 One day while meditating on the waywardness of fate
 He felt the ache of lonely man to find a fitting mate
 A petticoated pard to cheer his solitary life
 A woman with soft soothing ways a confidant a wife
 And while he cooked his supper on his little Yukon stove
 He wished that he had staked a claim in Loves rich treasuretrove
 When suddenly he paused and held aloft a Yukon egg
 For there in pencilled letters was the magic name of Peg

 You know these Yukon eggs of ourssome pink some green some blue
 A dollar per assorted tints assorted flavors too
 The supercilious cheechako might designate them high
 But one acquires a taste for them and likes them byandby
 Well HardLuck Henry took this egg and held it to the light
 And there was more faint pencilling that sorely taxed his sight
 At last he made it out and then the legend ran like this
 Will Klondike miner write to Peg Plumhollow Squashville Wis

 That night he got to thinking of this faroff unknown fair
 It seemed so sort of opportune an answer to his prayer
 She flitted sweetly through his dreams she haunted him by day
 She smiled through clouds of nicotine she cheered his weary way
 At last he yielded to the spell his course of love he set
 Wisconsin his objective point his object Margaret

 With every mile of sea and land his longing grew and grew
 He practised all his pretty words and these I fear were few
 At last one frosty evening with a cold chill down his spine
 He found himself before her house the threshold of the shrine
 His courage flickered to a spark then glowed with sudden flame
 He knocked he heard a welcome word she camehis goddess came
 Oh she was fair as any flower and huskily he spoke
 Im all the way from Klondike with a mighty heavy poke
 Im looking for a lassie one whose Christian name is Peg
 Who sought a Klondike miner and who wrote it on an egg

 The lassie gazed at him a space her cheeks grew rosy red
 She gazed at him with tearbright eyes then tenderly she said
 Yes lonely Klondike miner it is true my name is Peg
 Its also true I longed for you and wrote it on an egg
 My heart went out to someone in that land of night and cold
 But oh I fear that Yukon egg must have been mighty old
 I waited long I hoped and feared you should have come before
 Ive been a wedded woman now for eighteen months or more
 Im sorry since youve come so far you aint the one that wins
 But wont you take a step insideILL LET YOU SEE THE TWINS




The Man from Eldorado


 Hes the man from Eldorado and hes just arrived in town
 In moccasins and oily buckskin shirt
 Hes gaunt as any Indian and pretty nigh as brown
 Hes greasy and he smells of sweat and dirt
 He sports a crop of whiskers that would shame a healthy hog
 Hard work has racked his joints and stooped his back
 He slops along the sidewalk followed by his yellow dog
 But hes got a bunch of golddust in his sack

 He seems a little wistful as he blinks at all the lights
 And maybe he is thinking of his claim
 And the dark and dwarfish cabin where he lay and dreamed at nights
 Thank God hell never see the place again
 Where he lived on tinned tomatoes beef embalmed and sourdough bread
 On rusty beans and bacon furred with mould
 His stomachs out of kilter and his system full of lead
 But its over and his poke is full of gold

 He has panted at the windlass he has loaded in the drift
 He has pounded at the face of oozy clay
 He has taxed himself to sickness dark and damp and double shift
 He has labored like a demon night and day
 And now praise God its over and he seems to breathe again
 Of newmown hay the warm wet friendly loam
 He sees a snowy orchard in a green and dimpling plain
 And a little vineclad cottage and itsHome


 II

 Hes the man from Eldorado and hes had a bite and sup
 And hes met in with a drouthy friend or two
 Hes cached away his golddust but hes sort of bucking up
 So hes kept enough tonight to see him through
 His eye is bright and genial his tongue no longer lags
 His heart is brimming oer with joy and mirth
 He may be far from savory he may be clad in rags
 But tonight he feels as if he owns the earth

 Says he Boys here is where the shaggy North and I will shake
 I thought Id never manage to get free
 I kept on making misses but at last Ive got my stake
 Theres no more thawing frozen muck for me
 I am going to Gods Country where Ill live the simple life
 Ill buy a bit of land and make a start
 Ill carve a little homestead and Ill win a little wife
 And raise ten little kids to cheer my heart

 They signified their sympathy by crowding to the bar
 They bellied up three deep and drank his health
 He shed a radiant smile around and smoked a rank cigar
 They wished him honor happiness and wealth
 They drank unto his wife to bethat unsuspecting maid
 They drank unto his children half a score
 And when they got through drinking very tenderly they laid
 The man from Eldorado on the floor


 III

 Hes the man from Eldorado and hes only starting in
 To cultivate a thousanddollar jag
 His poke is full of golddust and his heart is full of sin
 And hes dancing with a girl called Muckluck Mag
 Shes as light as any fairy shes as pretty as a peach
 Shes mistress of the witchcraft to beguile
 Theres sunshine in her manner there is music in her speech
 And theres concentrated honey in her smile

 Oh the fever of the dancehall and the glitter and the shine
 The beauty and the jewels and the whirl
 The madness of the music the rapture of the wine
 The languorous allurement of a girl
 She is like a lost madonna he is gaunt unkempt and grim
 But she fondles him and gazes in his eyes
 Her kisses seek his heavy lips and soon it seems to him
 He has staked a little claim in Paradise

 Whos for a juicy twostep cries the master of the floor
 The music throbs with soft seductive beat
 Theres glitter gilt and gladness there are pretty girls galore
 Theres a woolly man with moccasins on feet
 They know theyve got him going he is buying wine for all
 They crowd around as buzzards at a feast
 Then when his poke is empty they boost him from the hall
 And spurn him in the gutter like a beast

 Hes the man from Eldorado and hes painting red the town
 Behind he leaves a trail of yellow dust
 In a whirl of senseless riot he is ramping up and down
 Theres nothing checks his madness and his lust
 And soon the word is passed aroundit travels like a flame
 They fight to clutch his hand and call him friend
 The chevaliers of lost repute the dames of sorry fame
 Then comes the grim awakeningthe end


 IV

 Hes the man from Eldorado and he gives a grand affair
 Theres feasting dancing wine without restraint
 The smooth Beau Brummels of the bar the faro men are there
 The tinhorns and purveyors of red paint
 The sleek and painted women their predacious eyes aglow
 Sure Klondike City never saw the like
 Then Muckluck Mag proposed the toast The giver of the show
 The livest sport that ever hit the pike

 The live one rises to his feet he stammers to reply
 And then there comes before his muddled brain
 A vision of green vastitudes beneath an April sky
 And clover pastures drenched with silver rain
 He knows that it can never be that he is down and out
 Life leers at him with foul and fetid breath
 And then amid the revelry the song and cheer and shout
 He suddenly grows grim and cold as death

 He grips the table tensely and he says Dear friends of mine
 Ive let you dip your fingers in my purse
 Ive crammed you at my table and Ive drowned you in my wine
 And Ive little left to give you butmy curse
 Ive failed supremely in my plans its rather late to whine
 My poke is mighty weasened up and small
 I thank you each for coming here the happiness is mine
 And now you thieves and harlots take it all

 He twists the thong from off his poke he swings it oer his head
 The nuggets fall around their feet like grain
 They rattle over roof and wall they scatter roll and spread
 The dust is like a shower of golden rain
 The guests a moment stand aghast then grovel on the floor
 They fight and snarl and claw like beasts of prey
 And then as everybody grabbed and everybody swore
 The man from Eldorado slipped away


 V

 Hes the man from Eldorado and they found him stiff and dead
 Half covered by the freezing ooze and dirt
 A clotted Colt was in his hand a hole was in his head
 And he wore an old and oily buckskin shirt
 His eyes were fixed and horrible as one who hails the end
 The frost had set him rigid as a log
 And there half lying on his breast his last and only friend
 There crouched and whined a mangy yellow dog




My Friends


 The man above was a murderer the man below was a thief
 And I lay there in the bunk between ailing beyond belief
 A weary armful of skin and bone wasted with pain and grief

 My feet were froze and the lifeless toes were purple and green and gray
 The little flesh that clung to my bones
 you could punch it in holes like clay
 The skin on my gums was a sullen black and slowly peeling away

 I was sure enough in a direful fix and often I wondered why
 They did not take the chance that was left and leave me alone to die
 Or finish me off with a dose of dopeso utterly lost was I

 But no they brewed me the greenspruce tea
 and nursed me there like a child
 And the homicide he was good to me and bathed my sores and smiled
 And the thief he starved that I might be fed
 and his eyes were kind and mild

 Yet they were woefully wicked men and often at night in pain
 I heard the murderer speak of his deed and dream it over again
 I heard the poor thief sorrowing for the dead self he had slain

 Ill never forget that bitter dawn so evil askew and gray
 When they wrapped me round in the skins of beasts
 and they bore me to a sleigh
 And we started out with the nearest post an hundred miles away

 Ill never forget the trail they broke with its tense unuttered woe
 And the crunch crunch crunch as their snowshoes sank
 through the crust of the hollow snow
 And my breath would fail and every beat of my heart was like a blow

 And oftentimes I would die the death yet wake up to life anew
 The sun would be all ablaze on the waste and the sky a blighting blue
 And the tears would rise in my snowblind eyes
 and furrow my cheeks like dew

 And the camps we made when their strength outplayed
 and the day was pinched and wan
 And oh the joy of that blessed halt and how I did dread the dawn
 And how I hated the weary men who rose and dragged me on

 And oh how I begged to rest to restthe snow was so sweet a shroud
 And oh how I cried when they urged me on cried and cursed them aloud
 Yet on they strained all racked and pained
 and sorely their backs were bowed

 And then it was all like a lurid dream and I prayed for a swift release
 From the ruthless ones who would not leave me to die alone in peace
 Till I wakened up and I found myself at the post of the Mounted Police

 And there was my friend the murderer and there was my friend the thief
 With bracelets of steel around their wrists and wicked beyond belief
 But when they come to Gods judgment seatmay I be allowed the brief




The Prospector


 I strolled up old Bonanza where I staked in ninetyeight
 Apurpose to revisit the old claim
 I kept thinking mighty sadly of the funny ways of Fate
 And the lads who once were with me in the game
 Poor boys theyre downandouters and theres scarcely one today
 Can show a dozen colors in his poke
 And me Im still prospecting old and battered gaunt and gray
 And Im looking for a grubstake and Im broke

 I strolled up old Bonanza The same old moon looked down
 The same old landmarks seemed to yearn to me
 But the cabins all were silent and the flat once like a town
 Was mighty still and lonesomelike to see
 There were piles and piles of tailings where we toiled with pick and pan
 And turning round a bend I heard a roar
 And there a giant goldship of the very newest plan
 Was tearing chunks of paydirt from the shore

 It wallowed in its waterbed it burrowed heaved and swung
 It gnawed its way ahead with grunts and sighs
 Its bill of fare was rock and sand the tailings were its dung
 It glared around with fierce electric eyes
 Full fifty buckets crammed its maw it bellowed out for more
 It looked like some great monster in the gloom
 With two to feed its sateless greed it worked for seven score
 And I sighed Ah oldtime miner heres your doom

 The idle windlass turns to rust the sagging sluicebox falls
 The holes you digged are water to the brim
 Your little sodroofed cabins with the snugly mosschinked walls
 Are deathly now and mouldering and dim
 The battlefield is silent where of old you fought it out
 The claims you fiercely won are lost and sold
 But theres a little army that theyll never put to rout
 The men who simply live to seek the gold

 The men who cant remember when they learned to swing a pack
 Or in what lawless land the quest began
 The solitary seeker with his grubstake on his back
 The restless buccaneer of pick and pan
 On the mesas of the Southland on the tundras of the North
 You will find us changed in face but still the same
 And it isnt need it isnt greed that sends us faring forth
 Its the fever its the glory of the game

 For once youve panned the speckled sand and seen the bonny dust
 Its peerless brightness blinds you like a spell
 Its little else you care about you go because you must
 And you feel that you could follow it to hell
 Youd follow it in hunger and youd follow it in cold
 Youd follow it in solitude and pain
 And when youre stiff and battened down let someone whisper Gold
 Youre lief to rise and follow it again

 Yet look you if I find the stuff its just like so much dirt
 I fling it to the four winds like a child
 Its wine and painted women and the things that do me hurt
 Till I crawl back beggared broken to the Wild
 Till I crawl back sapped and sodden to my grubstake and my tent
 Theres a city theres an army hear them shout
 Theres the gold in millions millions but I havent got a cent
 And oh its me its me that found it out

 It was my dream that made it good my dream that made me go
 To lands of dread and death disprized of man
 But oh Ive known a glory that their hearts will never know
 When I picked the first big nugget from my pan
 Its still my dream my dauntless dream that drives me forth once more
 To seek and starve and suffer in the Vast
 That heaps my heart with eager hope that glimmers on before
 My dream that will uplift me to the last

 Perhaps I am stark crazy but theres none of you too sane
 Its just a little matter of degree
 My hobby is to hunt out gold its fortressed in my brain
 Its life and love and wife and home to me
 And Ill strike it yes Ill strike it Ive a hunch I cannot fail
 Ive a vision Ive a prompting Ive a call
 I hear the hoarse stampeding of an army on my trail
 To the last the greatest gold camp of them all

 Beyond the sharktooth ranges sawing savage at the sky
 Theres a lowering land no white man ever struck
 Theres gold theres gold in millions and Ill find it if I die
 And Im going there once more to try my luck
 Maybe Ill failwhat matter Its a mandate its a vow
 And when in lands of dreariness and dread
 You seek the last lone frontier far beyond your frontiers now
 You will find the old prospector silent dead

 You will find a tattered tentpole with a ragged robe below it
 You will find a rusted goldpan on the sod
 You will find the claim Im seeking
 with my bones as stakes to show it
 But Ive sought the last Recorder and HesGod




The Black Sheep

 The aristocratic neerdowell in Canada frequently finds his way
 into the ranks of the Royal NorthWest Mounted Police Extract



 _Hark to the ewe that bore him
 What has muddied the strain
 Never his brothers before him
 Showed the hint of a stain
 Hark to the tups and wethers
 Hark to the old gray ram
 Were all of us white but hes black as night
 And hell never be worth a damn_

 Im up on the bally woodpile at the back of the barracks yard
 A damned disgrace to the force sir with a comrade standing guard
 Making the bluff Im busy doing my six months hard

 Six months hard and dismissed sir Isnt that rather hell
 And all because of the liquor laws and the wiles of a native belle
 Some hooch I gave to a siwash brave who swore that he wouldnt tell

 At least they SAY that I did it Its so in the town report
 All that I can recall is a night of revel and sport
 When I woke with a head in the guardroom
 and they dragged me sick into court

 And the O C said You are guilty and I said never a word
 For hang it you see I couldntI didnt know WHAT had occurred
 And under the circumstances denial would be absurd

 But the one that cooked my bacon was Grubbe of the City Patrol
 He fagged for my room at Eton and didnt I devil his soul
 And now he is getting even landing me down in the hole

 Plugging away on the woodpile doing chores round the square
 There goes an officers ladygives me a haughty stare
 Me thats an earls own nephewthat is the hardest to bear

 To think of the poor old mater awaiting her prodigal son
 Tho I broke her heart with my folly I was always the whitehaired one
 That fatted calf that theyre cooking will surely be overdone

 Ill go back and yarn to the Bishop Ill dance with the village belle
 Ill hand round tea to the ladies and everything will be well
 Where I have been wont matter what I have seen I wont tell

 Ill soar to their ken like a comet Theyll see me with never a stain
 But will they reform mefar from it We pay for our pleasure with pain
 But the dog will return to his vomit the hog to his wallow again

 Ive chewed on the rind of creation and bitter Ive tasted the same
 Stacked up against hell and damnation Ive managed to stay in the game
 Ive had my moments of sorrow Ive had my seasons of shame

 Thats past when ones natures a cracked one
 its too jolly hard to mend
 So long as the road is level so long as Ive cash to spend
 Im bound to go to the devil and its all the same in the end

 The bugle is sounding for stables the men troop off through the gloom
 An orderly laying the tables sings in the bright messroom
 Ill wash in the prison bucket and brush with the prison broom

 Ill lie in my cell and listen Ill wish that I couldnt hear
 The laugh and the chaff of the fellows swigging the canteen beer
 The nasal tone of the gramophone playing The Bandolier

 And it seems to me though its misty that night of the flowing bowl
 That the man who potlatched the whiskey and landed me into the hole
 _Was Grubbe that Unmerciful Bounder Grubbe of the City Patrol_




The Telegraph Operator


 I will not wash my face
 I will not brush my hair
 I pig around the place
 Theres nobody to care
 Nothing but rock and tree
 Nothing but wood and stone
 Oh God its hell to be
 Alone alone alone

 Snowpeaks and deepgashed draws
 Corral me in a ring
 I feel as if I was
 The only living thing
 On all this blighted earth
 And so I frowst and shrink
 And crouching by my hearth
 I hear the thoughts I think

 I think of all I miss
 The boys I used to know
 The girls I used to kiss
 The coin I used to blow
 The bars I used to haunt
 The racket and the row
 The beers I didnt want
 I wish I had em now

 Day after day the same
 Only a little worse
 No one to grouch or blame
 Oh for a loving curse
 Oh in the night I fear
 Haunted by nameless things
 Just for a voice to cheer
 Just for a hand that clings

 Faintly as from a star
 Voices come oer the line
 Voices of ghosts afar
 Not in this world of mine
 Lives in whose loom I grope
 Words in whose weft I hear
 Eager the thrill of hope
 Awful the chill of fear

 Im thinking out aloud
 I reckon that is bad
 The snow is like a shroud
 Maybe Im going mad
 Say wouldnt that be tough
 This awful hush that hugs
 And chokes one is enough
 To make a man go bugs

 Theres not a thing to do
 I cannot sleep at night
 No wonder Im so blue
 Oh for a friendly fight
 The din and rush of strife
 A musichall aglow
 A crowd a city life
 Dear God I miss it so

 Here you have moped enough
 Brace up and play the game
 But say its awful tough
 Day after day the same
 Ive said that twice I bet
 Well theres not much to say
 I wish I had a pet
 Or something I could play

 Cheer up dont get so glum
 And sick of everything
 The worst is yet to come
 God help you till the Spring
 God shield you from the Fear
 Teach you to laugh not moan
 Ha ha it sounds so queer
 Alone alone alone




The WoodCutter


 _The sky is like an envelope
 One of those blue official things
 And sealing it to mock our hope
 The moon a silver wafer clings
 What shall we find when death gives leave
 To readour sentence or reprieve_

 Im holding it down on Gods scrappile up on the fagend of earth
 Oer me a menace of mountains a river that grits at my feet
 Face to face with my soulself weighing my life at its worth
 Wondering what I was made for here in my last retreat

 Last Ah yes its the finish Have ever you heard a man cry
 Sobs that rake him and rend him right from the base of the chest
 Thats how Ive cried oh so often and now that my tears are dry
 I sit in the desolate quiet and wait for the infinite Rest

 Rest Well its restful around me its quiet clean to the core
 The mountains pose in their ermine in golden the hills are clad
 The big blue siltfreighted Yukon seethes by my cabin door
 And I think its only the river that keeps me from going mad

 By day its a ruthless monster a callous insatiate thing
 With oily bubble and eddy with sudden swirling of breast
 By night its a writhing Titan sullenly murmuring
 Ever and ever goaded and ever crying for rest

 It cries for its human tribute but me it will never drown
 Ive learned the lore of my river my river obeys me well
 I hew and I launch my cordwood and raft it to Dawson town
 Where wood means wine and women and incidentally hell

 Hell and the anguish thereafter Here as I sit alone
 Id give the life I have left me to lighten some load of care
 The bitterest part of the bitter is being denied to atone
 Lips that have mocked at Heaven lend themselves ill to prayer

 _Impotent as a beetle pierced on the needle of Fate
 A wretch in a cosmic deathcell peaks for my prison bars
 Whelmed by a world stupendous lonely and listless I wait
 Drowned in a sea of silence strewn with confetti of stars_

 See from far up the valley a rapier pierces the night
 The white searchray of a steamer Swiftly serenely it nears
 A proud white alien presence a glittering galley of light
 Confidentpoised triumphant freighted with hopes and fears

 I look as one looks on a vision I see it pulsating by
 I glimpse joyradiant faces I hear the thresh of the wheel
 Hooflike my heart beats a moment then silence swoops from the sky
 Darkness is piled upon darkness God only knows how I feel

 Maybe youve seen me sometimes maybe youve pitied me then
 The lonely waif of the woodcamp here by my cabin door
 Some day youll look and see not futile and outcast of men
 I shall be far from your pity resting forevermore

 _My life was a problem in ciphers a weary and profitless sum
 Slipshod and stupid I worked it dazed by negation and doubt
 Ciphers the total confronts me Oh Death with thy moistened thumb
 Stoop like a petulant schoolboy wipe me forever out_




The Song of the MouthOrgan

 With apologies to the singer of the Song of the Banjo


 Im a homely little bit of tin and bone
 Im beloved by the Legion of the Lost
 I havent got a vox humana tone
 And a dime or two will satisfy my cost
 I dont attempt your highfalutin flights
 I am more or less uncertain on the key
 But I tell you boys theres lots and lots of nights
 When youve taken mighty comfort out of me

 I weigh an ounce or two and Im so small
 You can pack me in the pocket of your vest
 And when at night so wearily you crawl
 Into your bunk and stretch your limbs to rest
 You take me out and play me soft and low
 The simple songs that trouble your heartstrings
 The tunes you used to fancy long ago
 Before you made a rotten mess of things

 Then a dreamy look will come into your eyes
 And you break off in the middle of a note
 And then with just the dreariest of sighs
 You drop me in the pocket of your coat
 But somehow I have bucked you up a bit
 And as you turn around and face the wall
 You dont feel quite so spineless and unfit
 Youre not so bad a fellow after all

 Do you recollect the bitter Arctic night
 Your camp beside the canyon on the trail
 Your tent a tiny square of orange light
 The moon above consumptivelike and pale
 Your supper cooked your little stove aglow
 You tired but snug and happy as a child
 Then twas Turkey in the Straw till your lips were nearly raw
 And you hurled your bold defiance at the Wild

 Do you recollect the flashing lashing pain
 The gulf of humid blackness overhead
 The lightning making rapiers of the rain
 The cattlehorns like candles of the dead
 You sitting on your bronco there alone
 In your slicker saddlesore and sick with cold
 Do you think the silent herd did not hear The Mocking Bird
 Or relish Silver Threads among the Gold

 Do you recollect the wild Magellan coast
 The headwinds and the icy roaring seas
 The nights you thought that everything was lost
 The days you toiled in water to your knees
 The frozen ratlines shrieking in the gale
 The hissing steeps and gulfs of livid foam
 When you cheered your messmates nine with Ben Bolt and Clementine
 And Dixie Land and Seeing Nellie Home

 Let the jammy banjo voice the Younger Son
 Who waits for his remittance to arrive
 I represent the grimy gritty one
 Who sweats his bones to keep himself alive
 Whos up against the real thing from his birth
 Whose heritage is hard and bitter toil
 I voice the weary smeary ones of earth
 The helots of the sea and of the soil

 Im the Steinway of strange mischief and mischance
 Im the Stradivarius of blank defeat
 In the downworld when the devil leads the dance
 I am simply and symbolically meet
 Im the irrepressive spirit of mankind
 Im the small boy playing knuckle down with Death
 At the end of all things known where Gods rubbishheap is thrown
 I shrill impudent triumph at a breath

 Im a humble little bit of tin and horn
 Im a byword Im a plaything Im a jest
 The virtuoso looks on me with scorn
 But theres times when I am better than the best
 Ask the stoker and the sailor of the sea
 Ask the mucker and the hewer of the pine
 Ask the herder of the plain ask the gleaner of the grain
 Theres a lowly loving kingdomand its mine




The Trail of NinetyEight


 I

 Gold We leapt from our benches Gold We sprang from our stools
 Gold We wheeled in the furrow fired with the faith of fools
 Fearless unfound unfitted far from the night and the cold
 Heard we the clarion summons followed the masterlureGold

 Men from the sands of the Sunland men from the woods of the West
 Men from the farms and the cities into the Northland we pressed
 Graybeards and striplings and women good men and bad men and bold
 Leaving our homes and our loved ones crying exultantlyGold

 Never was seen such an army pitiful futile unfit
 Never was seen such a spirit manifold courage and grit
 Never has been such a cohort under one banner unrolled
 As surged to the raggededged Arctic urged by the archtempterGold

 Farewell we cried to our dearests little we cared for their tears
 Farewell we cried to the humdrum and the yoke of the hireling years
 Just like a pack of schoolboys and the big crowd cheered us goodbye
 Never were hearts so uplifted never were hopes so high

 The spectral shores flitted past us and every whirl of the screw
 Hurled us nearer to fortune and ever we planned what wed do
 Do with the gold when we got itbig shiny nuggets like plums
 There in the sand of the river gouging it out with our thumbs

 And one man wanted a castle another a racing stud
 A third would cruise in a palace yacht like a rednecked prince of blood
 And so we dreamed and we vaunted millionaires to a man
 Leaping to wealth in our visions long ere the trail began


 II

 We landed in windswept Skagway We joined the weltering mass
 Clamoring over their outfits waiting to climb the Pass
 We tightened our girths and our packstraps we linked on the Human Chain
 Struggling up to the summit where every step was a pain

 Gone was the joy of our faces grim and haggard and pale
 The heedless mirth of the shipboard was changed to the care of the trail
 We flung ourselves in the struggle packing our grub in relays
 Step by step to the summit in the bale of the winter days

 Floundering deep in the sumpholes stumbling out again
 Crying with cold and weakness crazy with fear and pain
 Then from the depths of our travail ere our spirits were broke
 Grim tenacious and savage the lust of the trail awoke

 Klondike or bust rang the slogan every man for his own
 Oh how we flogged the horses staggering skin and bone
 Oh how we cursed their weakness anguish they could not tell
 Breaking their hearts in our passion lashing them on till they fell

 For grub meant gold to our thinking and all that could walk must pack
 The sheep for the shambles stumbled each with a load on its back
 And even the swine were burdened and grunted and squealed and rolled
 And men went mad in the moment huskily clamoring Gold

 Oh we were brutes and devils goaded by lust and fear
 Our eyes were strained to the summit the weaklings dropped to the rear
 Falling in heaps by the trailside heartbroken limp and wan
 But the gaps closed up in an instant and heedless the chain went on

 Never will I forget it there on the mountain face
 Antlike men with their burdens clinging in icy space
 Dogged determined and dauntless cruel and callous and cold
 Cursing blaspheming reviling and ever that battlecryGold

 Thus toiled we the army of fortune in hunger and hope and despair
 Till glacier mountain and forest vanished and radiantly fair
 There at our feet lay Lake Bennett and down to its welcome we ran
 The trail of the land was over the trail of the water began


 III

 We built our boats and we launched them Never has been such a fleet
 A packingcase for a bottom a mackinaw for a sheet
 Shapeless grotesque lopsided flimsy makeshift and crude
 Each man after his fashion builded as best he could

 Each man worked like a demon as prow to rudder we raced
 The winds of the Wild cried Hurry the voice of the waters Haste
 We hated those driving before us we dreaded those pressing behind
 We cursed the slow current that bore us we prayed to the God of the wind

 Spring and the hillsides flourished vivid in jewelled green
 Spring and our hearts blood nourished envy and hatred and spleen
 Little cared we for the Springbirth much cared we to get on
 Stake in the Great White Channel stake ere the best be gone

 The greed of the gold possessed us pity and love were forgot
 Covetous visions obsessed us brother with brother fought
 Partner with partner wrangled each one claiming his due
 Wrangled and halved their outfits sawing their boats in two

 Thuswise we voyaged Lake Bennett Tagish then Windy Arm
 Sinister savage and baleful boding us hate and harm
 Many a scow was shattered there on that iron shore
 Many a heart was broken straining at sweep and oar

 We roused Lake Marsh with a chorus we drifted many a mile
 There was the canyon before uscavelike its dark defile
 The shores swept faster and faster the river narrowed to wrath
 Waters that hissed disaster reared upright in our path

 Beneath us the green tumult churning above us the cavernous gloom
 Around us swift twisting and turning the black sullen walls of a tomb
 We spun like a chip in a millrace our hearts hammered under the test
 Thenoh the relief on each chill facewe soared into sunlight and rest

 Hand sought for hand on the instant Cried we Our troubles are oer
 Then like a rumble of thunder heard we a canorous roar
 Leaping and boiling and seething saw we a cauldron afume
 There was the rage of the rapids there was the menace of doom

 The river springs like a racer sweeps through a gash in the rock
 Buts at the boulderribbed bottom staggers and rears at the shock
 Leaps like a terrified monster writhes in its fury and pain
 Then with the crash of a demon springs to the onset again

 Dared we that ravening terror heard we its din in our ears
 Called on the Gods of our fathers juggled forlorn with our fears
 Sank to our waists in its fury tossed to the sky like a fleece
 Then when our dread was the greatest crashed into safety and peace

 But what of the others that followed losing their boats by the score
 Well could we see them and hear them strung down that desolate shore
 What of the poor souls that perished Little of them shall be said
 On to the Golden Valley pause not to bury the dead

 Then there were days of drifting breezes soft as a sigh
 Night trailed her robe of jewels over the floor of the sky
 The moonlit stream was a python silver sinuous vast
 That writhed on a shroud of velvetwell it was done at last

 There were the tents of Dawson there the scar of the slide
 Swiftly we poled oer the shallows swiftly leapt oer the side
 Fires fringed the mouth of Bonanza sunset gilded the dome
 The test of the trail was overthank God thank God we were Home




The Ballad of GumBoot Ben


 _He was an old prospector with a vision bleared and dim
 He asked me for a grubstake and the same I gave to him
 He hinted of a hidden trove and when I made so bold
 To question his veracity this is the tale he told_

 I do not seek the copper streak nor yet the yellow dust
 I am not fain for sake of gain to irk the frozen crust
 Let fellows gross find gilded dross far other is my mark
 Oh gentle youth this is the truthI go to seek the Ark

 I prospected the Pelly bed I prospected the White
 The Nordenscold for love of gold I piked from morn till night
 Afar and near for many a year I led the wild stampede
 Until I guessed that all my quest was vanity and greed

 Then came I to a land I knew no man had ever seen
 A haggard land forlornly spanned by mountains lank and lean
 The nitchies said twas full of dread of smoke and fiery breath
 And no man dare put foot in there for fear of pain and death

 But I was made all unafraid so careless and alone
 Day after day I made my way into that land unknown
 Night after night by campfire light I crouched in lonely thought
 Oh gentle youth this is the truthI knew not what I sought

 I rose at dawn I wandered on Tis somewhat fine and grand
 To be alone and hold your own in Gods vast awesome land
 Come woe or weal tis fine to feel a hundred miles between
 The trails you dare and pathways where the feet of men have been

 And so it fell on me a spell of wanderlust was cast
 The land was still and strange and chill and cavernous and vast
 And sad and dead and dull as lead the valleys sought the snows
 And far and wide on every side the ashen peaks arose

 The moon was like a silent spike that pierced the sky right through
 The small stars popped and winked and hopped in vastitudes of blue
 And unto me for company came creatures of the shade
 And formed in rings and whispered things that made me half afraid

 And strange though be twas borne on me that land had lived of old
 And men had crept and slain and slept where now they toiled for gold
 Through jungles dim the mammoth grim had sought the oozy fen
 And on his track all bent of back had crawled the hairy men

 And furthermore strange deeds of yore in this dead place were done
 They haunted me as wild and free I roamed from sun to sun
 Until I came where sudden flame uplit a terraced height
 A regnant peak that seemed to seek the coronal of night

 I scaled the peak my heart was weak yet on and on I pressed
 Skyward I strained until I gained its dazzling silver crest
 And there I found with all around a world supine and stark
 Swept clean of snow a flat plateau and on it laythe Ark

 Yes there I knew by two and two the beasts did disembark
 And so in haste I ran and traced in letters on the Ark
 My human nameBen Smiths the same And now I want to float
 A syndicate to haul and freight to town that noble boat

 _I met him later in a bar and made a gay remark
 Anent an ancient miner and an option on the Ark
 He gazed at me reproachfully as only topers can
 But what he said I cant repeathe was a bad old man_




Clancy of the Mounted Police


 In the little Crimson Manual its written plain and clear
 That who would wear the scarlet coat shall say goodbye to fear
 Shall be a guardian of the right a sleuthhound of the trail
 In the little Crimson Manual theres no such word as fail
 Shall follow on though heavens fall or hells topturrets freeze
 Half round the world if need there be on bleeding hands and knees
 Its duty duty first and last the Crimson Manual saith
 The Scarlet Rider makes reply Its dutyto the death
 And so they sweep the solitudes free men from all the earth
 And so they sentinel the woods the wilds that know their worth
 And so they scour the startled plains and mock at hurt and pain
 And read their Crimson Manual and find their duty plain
 Knights of the lists of unrenown born of the frontiers need
 Disdainful of the spoken word exultant in the deed
 Unconscious heroes of the waste proud players of the game
 Props of the power behind the throne upholders of the name
 For thus the Great White Chief hath said In all my lands be peace
 And to maintain his word he gave his West the Scarlet Police

 Lividlipped was the valley still as the grave of God
 Misty shadows of mountain thinned into mists of cloud
 Corpselike and stark was the land with a quiet that crushed and awed
 And the stars of the weird subarctic glimmered over its shroud

 Deep in the trench of the valley two men stationed the Post
 Seymour and Clancy the reckless fresh from the long patrol
 Seymour the sergeant and ClancyClancy who made his boast
 He could cinch like a bronco the Northland
 and cling to the prongs of the Pole

 Two lone men on detachment standing for law on the trail
 Undismayed in the vastness wise with the wisdom of old
 Out of the night hailed a halfbreed telling a pitiful tale
 White man starving and crazy on the banks of the Nordenscold

 Up sprang the redhaired Clancy lean and eager of eye
 Loaded the long toboggan strapped each dog at its post
 Whirled his lash at the leader then with a whoop and a cry
 Into the Great White Silence faded away like a ghost

 The clouds were a misty shadow the hills were a shadowy mist
 Sunless voiceless and pulseless the day was a dream of woe
 Through the icerifts the river smoked and bubbled and hissed
 Behind was a trail fresh broken in front the untrodden snow

 Ahead of the dogs ploughed Clancy haloed by steaming breath
 Through peril of open water through ache of insensate cold
 Up rivers wantonly winding in a land affianced to death
 Till he came to a cowering cabin on the banks of the Nordenscold

 Then Clancy loosed his revolver and he strode through the open door
 And there was the man he sought for crouching beside the fire
 The hair of his beard was singeing the frost on his back was hoar
 And ever he crooned and chanted as if he never would tire

 _I panned and I panned in the shiny sand
 and I sniped on the river bar
 But I know I know that its down below
 that the golden treasures are
 So Ill wait and wait till the floods abate
 and Ill sink a shaft once more
 And Id like to bet that Ill go home yet
 with a brass band playing before_

 He was nigh as thin as a sliver and he whined like a Moosehide cur
 So Clancy clothed him and nursed him as a mother nurses a child
 Lifted him on the toboggan wrapped him in robes of fur
 Then with the dogs sore straining started to face the Wild

 Said the Wild I will crush this Clancy so fearless and insolent
 For him will I loose my fury and blind and buffet and beat
 Pile up my snows to stay him then when his strength is spent
 Leap on him from my ambush and crush him under my feet

 Him will I ring with my silence compass him with my cold
 Closer and closer clutch him unto mine icy breast
 Buffet him with my blizzards deep in my snows enfold
 Claiming his life as my tribute giving my wolves the rest

 Clancy crawled through the vastness oer him the hate of the Wild
 Full on his face fell the blizzard cheering his huskies he ran
 Fighting fiercehearted and tireless snows that drifted and piled
 With ever and ever behind him singing the crazy man

 _Sing hey sing ho for the ice and snow
 And a heart thats ever merry
 Let us trim and square with a lovers care
 For why should a man be sorry
 A grave deep deep with the moon apeep
 A grave in the frozen mould
 Sing hey sing ho for the winds that blow
 And a grave deep down in the ice and snow
 A grave in the land of gold_

 Day after day of darkness the whirl of the seething snows
 Day after day of blindness the swoop of the stinging blast
 On through a blur of fury the swing of staggering blows
 On through a world of turmoil empty inane and vast

 Night with its writhing stormwhirl night despairingly black
 Night with its hours of terror numb and endlessly long
 Night with its weary waiting fighting the shadows back
 And ever the crouching madman singing his crazy song

 Cold with its creeping terror cold with its sudden clinch
 Cold so utter you wonder if twill ever again be warm
 Clancy grinned as he shuddered Surely it isnt a cinch
 Being wetnurse to a looney in the teeth of an arctic storm

 The blizzard passed and the dawn broke knifeedged and crystal clear
 The sky was a bluedomed iceberg sunshine outlawed away
 Ever by snowslide and icerip haunted and hovered the Fear
 Ever the Wild malignant poised and panted to slay

 The leaddog freezes in harnesscut him out of the team
 The lung of the wheeldogs bleedingshoot him and let him lie
 On and on with the otherslash them until they scream
 Pull for your lives you devils On To halt is to die

 There in the frozen vastness Clancy fought with his foes
 The ache of the stiffened fingers the cut of the snowshoe thong
 Cheeks blackraw through the hoodflap eyes that tingled and closed
 And ever to urge and cheer him quavered the madmans song

 Colder it grew and colder till the last heat left the earth
 And there in the great stark stillness the bale fires glinted and gleamed
 And the Wild all around exulted and shook with a devilish mirth
 And life was far and forgotten the ghost of a joy once dreamed

 Death And one who defied it a man of the Mounted Police
 Fought it there to a standstill long after hope was gone
 Grinned through his bitter anguish fought without let or cease
 Suffering straining striving stumbling struggling on

 Till the dogs lay down in their traces and rose and staggered and fell
 Till the eyes of him dimmed with shadows
 and the trail was so hard to see
 Till the Wild howled out triumphant and the world was a frozen hell
 Then said Constable Clancy I guess that its up to me

 Far down the trail they saw him
 and his hands they were blanched like bone
 His face was a blackened horror from his eyelids the salt rheum ran
 His feet he was lifting strangely as if they were made of stone
 But safe in his arms and sleeping he carried the crazy man

 So Clancy got into Barracks and the boys made rather a scene
 And the O C called him a hero and was nice as a man could be
 But Clancy gazed down his trousers at the place where his toes had been
 And then he howled like a husky and sang in a shaky key

 _When I go back to the old love thats true to the fingertips
 Ill say Heres bushels of gold love
 and Ill kiss my girl on the lips
 Its yours to have and to hold love
 Its the proud proud boy Ill be
 When I go back to the old love thats waited so long for me_




Lost


 _Black is the sky but the land is white
 O the wind the snow and the storm
 Father where is our boy tonight
 Pray to God he is safe and warm_

 _Mother mother why should you fear
 Safe is he and the Arctic moon
 Over his cabin shines so clear
 Rest and sleep twill be morning soon_

 Its getting dark awful sudden Say this is mighty queer
 Where in the world have I got to Its still and black as a tomb
 I reckoned the camp was yonder I figured the trail was here
 Nothing Just draw and valley packed with quiet and gloom
 Snow that comes down like feathers thick and gobby and gray
 Night that looks spiteful uglyseems that Ive lost my way

 The colds got an edge like a jackknifeit must be forty below
 Leastways thats what it seems likeit cuts so fierce to the bone
 The winds getting real ferocious its heaving and whirling the snow
 It shrieks with a howl of fury it dies away to a moan
 Its arms sweep round like a banshees swift and icily white
 And buffet and blind and beat me Lord its a hell of a night

 Im all tangled up in a blizzard Theres only one thing to do
 Keep on moving and moving its death its death if I rest
 Oh God if I see the morning if only I struggle through
 Ill say the prayers Ive forgotten since I lay on my mothers breast
 I seem going round in a circle maybe the camp is near
 Say did somebody holler Was it a light I saw
 Or was it only a notion Ill shout and maybe theyll hear
 No the wind only drowns meshout till my throat is raw

 The boys are all round the campfire wondering when Ill be back
 Theyll soon be starting to seek me theyll scarcely wait for the light
 What will they find I wonder when they come to the end of my track
 A hand stuck out of a snowdrift frozen and stiff and white
 Thats what theyll strike I reckon thats how theyll find their pard
 A piefaced corpse in a snowbankcurse you dont be a fool
 Play the game to the finish bet on your very last card
 Nerve yourself for the struggle Oh you coward keep cool

 Im going to lick this blizzard Im going to live the night
 It cant down me with its blusterIm not the kind to be beat
 On hands and knees will I buck it with every breath will I fight
 Its life its life that I fight fornever it seemed so sweet
 I know that my face is frozen my hands are numblike and dead
 But oh my feet keep amoving heavy and hard and slow
 Theyre trying to kill me kill me the night thats black overhead
 The wind that cuts like a razor the whipcord lash of the snow
 Keep amoving amoving dont dont stumble you fool
 Curse this snow thats apiling apurpose to block my way
 Its heavy as gold in the rocker its white and fleecy as wool
 Its soft as a bed of feathers its warm as a stack of hay
 Curse on my feet that slip so my poor tired stumbling feet
 I guess theyre a job for the surgeon they feel so queerlike to lift
 Ill rest them just for a momentoh but to rest is sweet
 The awful wind cannot get me deep deep down in the drift

 _Father a bitter cry I heard
 Out of the night so dark and wild
 Why is my heart so strangely stirred
 Twas like the voice of our erring child_

 _Mother mother you only heard
 A waterfowl in the locked lagoon
 Out of the night a wounded bird
 Rest and sleep twill be morning soon_

 Who is it talks of sleeping Ill swear that somebody shook
 Me hard by the arm for a moment but how on earth could it be
 See how my feet are movingawfully funny they look
 Moving as if they belonged to a someone that wasnt me
 The wind down the nights long alley bowls me down like a pin
 I stagger and fall and stagger crawl armdeep in the snow
 Beaten back to my corner how can I hope to win
 And there is the blizzard waiting to give me the knockout blow

 Oh Im so warm and sleepy No more hunger and pain
 Just to rest for a moment was ever rest such a joy
 Ha what was that Ill swear it somebody shook me again
 Somebody seemed to whisper Fight to the last my boy
 Fight Thats right I must struggle I know that to rest means death
 Death but then what does death meanease from a world of strife
 Life has been none too pleasant yet with my failing breath
 Still and still must I struggle fight for the gift of life

     

 Seems that I must be dreaming Here is the old home trail
 Yonder a light is gleaming oh I know it so well
 The air is scented with clover the cattle wait by the rail
 Father is through with the milking there goes the supperbell

     

 Mother your boy is crying out in the night and cold
 Let me in and forgive me Ill never be bad any more
 Im oh so sick and so sorry please dear mother dont scold
 Its just your boy and he wants you    Mother open the door   

 _Father father I saw a face
 Pressed just now to the windowpane
 Oh it gazed for a moments space
 Wild and wan and was gone again_

 _Mother mother you saw the snow
 Drifted down from the maple tree
 Oh the wind that is sobbing so
 Weary and worn and old are we
 Only the snow and a wounded loon
 Rest and sleep twill be morning soon_




LEnvoi


 We talked of yesteryears of trails and treasure
 Of men who played the game and lost or won
 Of mad stampedes of toil beyond all measure
 Of campfire comfort when the day was done
 We talked of sullen nights by moondogs haunted
 Of bird and beast and tree of rod and gun
 Of boat and tent of huntingtrip enchanted
 Beneath the wonder of the midnight sun
 Of bloodyfooted dogs that gnawed the traces
 Of prisoned seas windlashed and winterlocked
 The icegray dawn was pale upon our faces
 Yet still we filled the cup and still we talked

 The city street was dimmed We saw the glitter
 Of moonpicked brilliants on the virgin snow
 And down the drifted canyon heard the bitter
 Relentless slogan of the winds of woe
 The city was forgot and parkaskirted
 We trod that leagueless land that once we knew
 We saw stream past down valleys glaciergirted
 The wolfworn legions of the caribou
 We smoked our pipes oer scenes of triumph dwelling
 Of deeds of daring dire defeats we talked
 And other tales that lost not in the telling
 Ere to our beds uncertainly we walked

 And so dear friends in gentler valleys roaming
 Perhaps when on my printed page you look
 Your fancies by the firelight may go homing
 To that lone land that haply you forsook
 And if perchance you hear the silence calling
 The frozen music of staryearning heights
 Or dreaming see the seines of silver trawling
 Across the skys abyss on vasty nights
 You may recall that sweep of savage splendor
 That land that measures each man at his worth
 And feel in memory half fierce half tender
 The brotherhood of men that know the North
