1 Bicycle RideWalden


After I left Ramas inner circle in 1985 I occasionally bicycled
to Walden Pond where I read about Thoreaus experiment with
selfreliance My seven years in the cult of RamaDr Frederick Lenz
who was known early on as Atmanandahad deeply shaken my confidence
Atmananda often assured me that I was possessed by Negative Forces
that I was barely able to function in the real world and that I
was fortunate he did not drop me off at a mental institution
I met him in 1978 when I was seventeen

Thoreau helped me recall a time before Atmananda when I was strong
and selfreliant I had been an avid cyclist Pedaling thousands
of miles each year helped strengthen both my legs and selfesteem
Throughout my teenage years bicycling and selfconfidence were
inextricably linked and I grew to believe I could ride anywhere
under any conditions I tried to approach life with a similar gusto
which may explain why in 1979 Atmananda invited me to move with him
to southern California to start a spiritual centre From 1979 to 1981
I lived with him by the cliffs of La Jolla where I witnessed his
rise to power Today in 1993 he controls the minds of several
hundred computer consultants businessmen doctors and lawyers
Each year he extracts from them roughly ten million dollars

As I gazed at Walden Pond in search of calm the wind spawned new waves
and the surface swelled with complexity I recalled what Atmananda
had said after I returned from a fiveday bike trip in California
He announced in front of other disciples that my aura was dark
He also said that I had been attacked by nocturnal
mountaindwelling Entities which cause neurosis and psychosis
obliterate lifetimes of spiritual evolution and can possess
your soul

Atmanandas Entityprevention program included studying with a
fully enlightened teacher meditating regularly and avoiding
solitary excursions into nature Yet in the spring of 1986
nearly one year after I left him I reminded myself that I would
rather be possessed in my world than potentially perfect in his
I planned to pedal across America not with an exorcist but with
a puppy

On May 31 1986 as warm moist air pushed pockets of fog over Walden Pond
I lifted the fourmonthold Siberian husky Nunatak into the
doggiecarrier The carrier rested on top of the bicycle trailer
attached to the frame of my 12speed Strong headwinds soon strained
my muscles shook the lush canopy of foliage and pelted me with
large drops of rain As I began the journey west the front tire
raced through puddles while my mind raced through painful memories
and questions How had my years with Atmananda affected me Why was
it so difficult to leave him What was it about my past that led me to him




2 Zapped


Lights said my father and for a moment except for the
phosphorescent hands of the clock on the wall the room went black
With a flip of a switch he suddenly reappeared a tall
thin man with thick glasses standing beside the glowing enlarger
As a child I sat for hours under a dim yellow light
mesmerized by images appearing on paper submerged in trays filled
with smelly liquid Yellow my father taught me has no apparent
effect on the lightsensitive specks coating photographic paper

The unorthodox images which leapt from the walls of our house seemed
as eerie as the darkroom experience itself there was a photograph
of a llamas head as viewed through a distorting fisheye lens
there was a photograph of a shredded poster of a mans face
and there were many abstract photos which seemed to defy description
My father a production manager at a New York publishing company
perhaps saw the world in a different light than his peers

My mother was an elementary school teacher with black hair and
sometimes kind sometimes intense eyes A generous and caring woman
she put her career on hold for more than a decade to raise a family
She met my father in upstate New York on a hike sponsored by an
outing club

When I was fourteen I sensed that my father was growing tired
detached and depressed but I did not understand why He expressed
abstractions better than emotions and found it difficult to vent
the angers and frustrations which had accumulated from work and from home

Nor did I understand that my mother freely gave to me what she
in her youth had sorely missed love Oblivious to the magnitude
of her workloadshe taught fulltime and was pursuing a Masters degree
I grew angry with her as a teenager partly because she seemed
insecure and overbearing and partly because she expected me
my brother and my father to help keep the house clean in the way
that she wanted

Despite my familys love for the outdoors for our dog
and for one another the emotional fabric that bound us together
often seemed on the verge of ripping apart And the problems
only intensified as my brother and I grew older

Twoandahalfyears my elder my brother was an avid backpacker
and rock climber with jetblack hair Gandhi glasses and a gentle
but determined disposition He too felt that something in our family
was out of whack and we occasionally discussed what we would
do when we left home But unlike me he had no one to buffer him
from my parents who I was starting to discover were only human

I was a sensitive child I was so sensitive that the sounds of someone
chewing made me upset I was a light sleeper I was also a slob
a kneejerk rebel and something of a nerd when it came to doing
things like making friends with girls Nonetheless I decided
that I could work out whatever I needed to work out in a healthier
environment than at home the countdown to the last day of high school
after which I planned to set out on my own began when I was
around fifteen Meanwhile I read a lot and spent time with friends
some of whom also enjoyed hiking and bicycling

In the summer of 1976 when I was sixteen I bicycled from the White
Mountains of New Hampshire to Boston with people from an outing club
One morning as I watched my traveling companions prepare their daily dose
of hallucinogens I realized that I wanted to be part of their fellowship
The desire however was checked by a gutlevel impulse to avoid drugs
so Jim a sinewy guy stooped over a pot of boiling morning glory seeds
turned me on instead to The Teachings of Don Juan A Yaqui Way
of Knowledge This was a popular account of Carlos Castanedas
purported apprenticeship with Yaqui Indian medicine man Juan Matus
or Don Juan

From the cover of the book peered a menacing and surreal painting
of a crow

But a crow isnt always a crow said Jim softly paraphrasing Don
Juan as he stirred the seeds Sometimes its a powerful sorcerer
in disguise

Intrigued by the paradox of the crow I plowed through The Teachings of Don
Juan and through Castanedas A Separate Reality and Journey To Ixtlan
At summers end still drugless and clueless as to whether crows
were birds or sorcerers I left Boston clutching a Castaneda book

Back in New York I chose to see the world less through the eyes
of an eleventh grader taking honors physics and history
and more through the eyes of a sorcerers apprentice
I incorporated into my daily routine Don Juans recommendations
As an exercise in humility I spoke aloud to plants To see beyond
societys description of reality I tried to stop my thoughts
To expand my awareness beyond the confines of the waking state
I sought to wake within a dream

My interest in what lay beyond the scope of traditional reality led
to an interest in what lay beyond the scope of traditional education
and that fall I thought about switching to a public experimental
high school founded in the late 60s I firmly believed that I
would thrive in a world without grades attendance taking tests
and requirements In January 1977 with the guidance of my brother
I managed to persuade my reluctant parents to let me join

I chose to continue taking physics and history at the traditional school
other subjects I took at the nontraditional school where
in a creative writing class I wrote



 Teachers force us to perceive
 The surface world of reason
 A tree is but a pole with leaves
 Whose habits change each season



I thrived within a selfdesigned academically rigorous educational program
but experienced no breakthroughs in my search for Hidden Realms
of Perception until the following summer The experience came when I
was working tenhour days and fiveandahalf day weeks on a farm
in southern New Hampshire In my spare time I was designing
and building an electricityproducing windmill which ended up
towering some twenty feet above Onyx one of the tallest cows
Farmcrew members sometimes walked out to the hay fields to get high
One night after smoking marijuana I fell asleep and later saw
above where I lay a cow its head swaying gently to and fro
Though I thought I was awake it was but a dream for when I woke
from waking the cow had disappeared This experience led me
to believe that like Mr Castanedas mentor I could consciously
direct my actions within the context of a dream

Back in New York I became editorinchief of the high school newspaper
I soon learned that I had a knack for inspiring and for managing
a team I was well regarded by my teachers and by my peers
and I had many friends I could have continued my studies at
a prestigious university but I longed for a mystical quest
I dreamt that I walked silently across a vast desert plain I longed
to experience that which lay beyond the surface world of reason
I dreamt that I flew over desert chaparral into an infinite orange horizon
I longed for a wisdom that was secret magical ancient I decided
to hitchhike alone to the Sonoran Desert in Mexico to find
a mystical teacher a brujo who was just like Don Juan I planned
to leave on the day after high school graduation

Meanwhile I continued to read the Castaneda books and to experiment
with consciousness One time I attempted to raise my right arm
without consciously lifting it I wanted it to levitate on its own
I soon felt a tingling in the arm but it did not rise Finally I lifted
it on purpose Then as part of the experiment I suggested to myself
that the arm remain lifted As long as I repeated the suggestion
the arm remained where it was Afterwards I could not recall
how long the state of mind had lasted

My brother shared with me an interest in rising above the limitations
of home school religion society and reality By the time
I turned him on to the Castaneda books he had already studied
Einsteins special theory of relativity and The Tao Of Physics
In the spring of 1978 when he was studying physics at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook he told me that he had met
an English professor who was an expert on the Castaneda books
He knew that my quest for a teacher would begin in roughly two months
when I would graduate from high school He wanted to help me
He suggested that I attend the Castaneda experts free lecture series on
meditation in Manhattan

I wondered why a Castaneda expert would live on Long Island rather
than in a remote desert in Mexico but my brothers enthusiasm
was sincere Besides I thought as we rode the train into the city
anything I learn now will only help me on the journey

We arrived at a building on 33rd Street A rickety elevator took
us to the third floor where the sweet and spicy aroma of incense
wafted through the air I saw a row of sneakers by the elevator
door and wondered if they had been responsible for the incense
After placing our sneakers in line with the others we walked past
a sign which read Yoga Life Perfection A young woman with long
black hair and a playful impish grin sold books and incense in
the hallway She recognized my brother and smiled at us She wore
a sari

We entered a mediumsized room where a smoldering stick
of incense and two unlit candles rested on a table up front
Two young women stood together near the back of the room
One had long brown hair and dreamy eyes The other had a face
and figure like a model Their faces were flushed and aglow
They also wore saris

Too bad Im not gonna be sticking around New York I thought
gazing at them

In the audience sat two women in their sixties dressed entirely
in black They sat near a man in his thirties with the frame
of a metal pyramid resting squarely on his head

We sat by the two sariclad women They were clearly excited
about something They used words like inspiration aspiration
concentration visualization meditation reincarnation and perfection
My brother too seemed excited as if something extraordinary
and wonderful were about to occur With each passing minute
I found myself growing more curious more impatient and more excited
Fifteen minutes after the talk was scheduled to begin the women
in saris stopped talking and looked up

I looked up too and saw a tall man with a projecting nose and
lush locks His long strides seemed synchronized with his arms
which swung like perfectly conflicting pendulums this motion
seemed to propel him into the room He sat on the table facing
the audience folded his legs in the pretzellike posture seen
in Buddha statues and introduced himself as Dr Frederick Lenz
He explained that he had another name Atmananda Then he lit
the candles and asked us to drop our preconceived notions because
meditation is beyond thought

Thought is like a car he said in a smooth charming voice
You can drive it to California But if you want to cross the ocean
you will need an alternate means of transportation If you want
to cross the sea of consciousness you will need meditation

Though his metaphors were new to me they seemed to point
the way beyond the surface world of reason He used words
like guru avatar warrior power power spots personal power
moments of power spiritual power psychic power ecstasy enlightenment
cosmic love transcendental supreme Nirvana and the Infinite
When he said it was time to meditate I was surprised
that he had been speaking for over forty minutes It had seemed like five

Now extend your index fingers and close your eyes Atmananda instructed

I squinted to see if anyone else was peeking From what I could tell
the twenty or so people obeyed him

Now say me out loud and touch your chest

My me was muffled by the groups me

You are not only pointing to your chest Atmananda explained
but to your heart chakra one of seven psychic energy centers
associated with the subtle body Concentrating on a chakra is an easy
way to begin crossing the sea of consciousness

So we sat there drifting and though I tried to stop my thoughts
and feel the throbbing pulse of my heart chakra I found myself
checking out the women in saris

Very good he said after about five minutes Then he suggested
that we sit back relax and ask questions

There was something hauntingly familiar about this confident
wellspoken young professor Perhaps it was the way his chin
jutted forward the rich timbre of his voice or his seeming
interest in helping people that reminded me of the cartoon character
DudleyDoRight I felt drawn to him I found myself staring into
his full moon gripping eyes I found myself seeking his attention

Can a person be healed by meditating I asked only partly
concerned that I had a cold

He locked my attention with those eyesI felt slightly dizzyit
was not unpleasantit felt as though I were floatingmy vision
blurredthings went fuzzy and whiteit appeared as though it
were snowing

Am I having a vision I wondered and immediately the snow vanished
Just then Atmananda seemed unreal like a superhero from a cosmic
comicstrip that had been cut enlarged and inserted into the room
When he smiled at me I had the uncanny sense that he knew what I
had felt and seen Then he left flanked by the women in saris




3 The Joining


In the days following Atmanandas talk I longed to know if my vision
of the snow had been a mystical experience an optical illusion
or a figment of my imagination Graduation was only weeks away
I assumed that Atmananda would help me solve the mystery and I counted
the days until his next public lecture

I did not tell my friends much about Atmananda They seemed content
even after reading the Castaneda books to view the world through a
rational framework In contrast I grew excited about the possibility
of transcending the world of reason altogether They were proud
of their letters of acceptance from the Harvards and the Princetons
I was proud of my letter of acceptance from The School Of Mysticism
My letter arrived in the form of brilliant white specks which swirled
about me like snow

Nor did I tell my parents who represented discord anxiety
and manipulationthe opposite of what Atmananda seemed to stand for

Instead I spoke with my brother He and I were close
I wanted to be just like him He used words such as disciples
selflessservice humanity humility purity soul soulmate
pastlives karma fast track and cosmic evolution He got
excited when he talked about Atmananda He told me that he too
had experienced perceptual distortion during Atmanandas talks
We returned to Yoga Life Perfection

About thirty minutes after the talk was scheduled to begin
Atmananda strode through the door He wore a light brown suit

Anne he said did you bring the Transcendental

The sariclad woman who had sold incense at the last lecture
placed a frame on the table beside Atmananda The Transcendental
was a photograph of Atmanandas Indian guru Chinmoy But it
was so underexposed that it seemed not a picture of a guru
but rather a mugshot of a ghost with high cheekbones
It reminded me of one of the experimental images which had emerged
from my fathers darkroom

The Transcendental portrays Guru in his highest
transcendental consciousness my brother told me

Atmananda scanned the audience mostly women in their sixties
Then he began to lecture not on meditation but on reincarnation
which he had done many times before

Maya or illusion eclipses the original perfection of the soul
he said The soul reincarnates over thousands of lessons known
as lifetimes

I could not recall learning about reincarnation at Hebrew school

As the soul evolves it transcends desire and attachment
which is the root of all suffering Finally enlightenment occurs

Unaware that he was borrowing Hindu and Buddhist doctrine and intrigued
but not convinced that in a future life I would attain enlightenment
I kept one eye on Atmananda and the other on Anne

Everything can be classified according to its level of
spiritual evolution Rocks and minerals are very primitive
whereas plants have more developed auras After thousands of years
the soul seeks an animal incarnation Except in rare instances
enlightenment occurs through the human form only

I grinned and wiggled my thumbs figuring I was already ahead
of the game

Humans in their early incarnations are responsible for many of
the worlds problems But evolved people are not better than others
Are college students any better than third graders

This diffused my concern that Atmanandas line of reasoning justified
the formation of an evolved elite

Karma is a cosmic feedback mechanism triggered by past actions
In a universe governed by karma few experiences are coincidental

I supposed a lottery winner could have been a generous philanthropist
in a past life But remembering the various times I had been
robbed while growing up in New York I doubted that I had spent
incarnations as a mugger Still I liked his contention that it
was karmas role not to punish but to educate

After thousands of human incarnations you become ready to study with
an enlightened teacher You may suddenly notice a teachers poster
You may have seen the poster many times beforeonly this time
something clicks

I looked at the Transcendental and wondered if the Guru who looked
like he badly needed sleep could make something in me click

Atmananda turned toward me as if in response to my newest doubt
and said An enlightened teacher can take a person through thousands
of lives in just one lifetime

Whats the rush I thought

The sooner you attain enlightenment the sooner you can help
others transcend this world of pain and suffering

How did he do that I wondered unsure if he were addressing
typical doubts or if he were actually reading my mind

Atmananda continued to look at me I found myself gazing
without blinking into his eyesI began to feel as if I were
floating somewhere far away I sensed my body breathingI
heard bzzzzzzzz droning on and on and on

He turned away and I returned to normal consciousness

Holy cow I thought He did it again Suddenly I imagined
that he was a sorcerer and I his apprentice I forgot about Anne
and carefully followed his words

Advanced seekers say that after they attain enlightenment they
will return to earth to help others But most of them end up
choosing eternal ecstasy instead

I vowed to come back and help the downtrodden

It is even rarer for fully enlightened souls to return he said
pointing out that his Guru was fully enlightened

Fully enlightened souls Atmananda explained were aware
of those who meditated sincerely on their photograph
Atmananda then instructed us to meditate on the Transcendental
After about ten minutes of silence he asked Who saw the light
around Guru

One woman shot up her hand Then another I admitted to myself
that I thought I saw the photo glow

Guru flooded you with light from another world he explained
Then inviting the audience to experience the advanced side of
selfdiscovery he told us about Chinmoys free weekly meditations
at St Pauls Chapel Columbia University

By this time in keeping with Atmanandas suggestions
my brother had applied to study with Chinmoy He was accepted
He lived near the State University of New York at Stony Brook
near the eight or so Chinmoy disciples near Atmananda When I asked
him to take me to his Guru he said that he would

We met at our parents home He wore all white clothes
White symbolizes puritythe spiritual quality men need to develop most
he explained quoting Chinmoy Wearing white only adds one or two
percent more purity to your consciousness but every bit helps

My mother came into the room and looked at my brother

Uhoh I thought I felt bad for my mother She typically
had to deal with me and my brother on her own Perhaps in
anticipation of an ulcer condition my father tended to avoid
socalled family discussions If only she would leave us alone
I figured she would not get so bent out of shape

I also felt bad for my brother Everything he did it seemed
aggravated my parents They should support him in his spiritual quest
I decided

Now my mother looked upset I did not know it then but she was
not upset that her sons were interested in yoga In her youth she
had satisfied a similar interest in the East by taking a course on
Gandhis philosophy She grew concerned however when she realized
that we were intensely focusing on one personon a living guru

Where are you boys going she asked

Its okay Mom I replied assuming my role as mediator
Were just going to a talk on relaxation and meditationyou know
stuff like that I had already told her about Chinmoy and Atmananda
Mom I think I found a teacher right here in New York But she
wanted to know more She looked hurt

Youre upset about relaxation and meditation I said trying my
best to reason with her This is nothing Mom What are you
going to say when I hitchhike to Mexico to study with a brujo

The silence that ensued bore with it all the weight
of a mothers love hope and fear for her sons

We said goodbye and rode to the city

I mean I have to lead my own life I thought and focused
on my parents shortcomings to offset pangs of guilt

Manhattans ivyleague citadel of the intellect seemed an unlikely
spot for people to be led beyond thought But then finding a
guru with an enlightened soul uptown seemed no less likely than
meeting a sorcerer with a PhD downtown We switched at Grand
Central Station to an uptown train and emerged at 125th Street
The clatter of subway cars gave way to traffic noise which faded once
we entered the Columbia University campus Soon we ascended steps
to St Pauls Chapel Ahead of us were men with closely cropped
hair wearing all white clothes With hair clenched in braids
the sariwrapped women walked apart from the menwho were not looking
at them At the top of the stairs dressed in a red tennis outfit
stood Atmananda

Hi Atmananda said my brother looking up

With folded arms Atmananda looked down and said Hello Dan

You remember my kid brother

Hello kid brother

Atmananda and I were roughly the same height yet as disciples
flocked by him he seemed much taller I was again struck by
his piercing eyes sharp nose and thick crown of brown hair
With such a countenance of nobility he could have passed as a high
Roman senator or Greek god

Guru couldnt make it this week he said Why dont you go
in and meditate and pick up on Gurus vibes

My brother and I went inside High above us on the massive chapel
dome were paintings of angels Perhaps it was the distant angels
the two hundred or more silent disciples and the rising scent
of sandalwood incense that made me feel foreign and small
We meditated for about five minutes and left

Outside Atmananda was speaking with a man in white when it struck
me that he was wearing red A nonconformist within a group
of nonconformists I thought

He nodded to us but continued talking

I walked by and noticed his name tag Directly beneath ATMANANDA
glimmered a sticker from AAA and this warning Fasten Your Seat Belt

That night in the Castaneda books I read how ordinary events
were often portentous omens I wondered if there was a significant
message hidden in the Gurus absence I wondered too if I
was supposed to meditate with this Guru before hitchhiking west

The following week I ventured with my brother to another of
Atmanandas lectures We also returned to meditate with Chinmoy
When we arrived at Columbia disciples were arranging flowers
lighting incense and otherwise darting about in preparation
for their masters presence Chinmoy apparently was on his way
Several minutes later a short stocky Indian entered the chapel
He had a shiny head a hooked nose and high cheek bones He was draped
in a lightblue dhoti the male version of a sari He walked slowly
toward the front He sat in a big blue chair opened his eyes wide
and blinked a couple of times

Disciples in the audience sat with their hands folded as if they
were praying to him

Are they praying to him I asked my brother

No he whispered They are aspiring to the Infinite in him

The Guru sipped from a glass which he held with his pinky pointing out

Well I thought As long as they arent praying to him

Suddenly Chinmoy belted out Aummm
Auuummmmmm Auuummmmmmmmmmmm After five
minutes of meditation the Guru folded his hands and bowed to the audience

My brother whispered He is offering his meditation to the Infinite
in us

That about evens the score I thought feeling better about
the whole business of guru worship

Chinmoy signaled a disciple who placed a box of oranges before him
He stood behind it and nodded to the audience which began forming
a line

At first I thought he was just giving out oranges But by filling
the fruits with spiritual light my brother explained the Guru
was really giving darshan

One by one the disciples looked into Chinmoys eyes with
outstretched hands When they received the darshan they touched
the orange to their heart chakra bowed and walked reverentially
back to the benches

When it came my turn I approached slowly so that people
would think I was spiritual When Guru flickers his eyes
I recalled my brother telling me he is entering the perfect
awareness of Nirvakalpa Samadhi I looked up Chinmoy smiled
flickered his eyes and pulled from the boxnothing He had run
out of oranges

An omen I thought I was unsure though what the delay
exactly meant Nonetheless I decided to take advantage of the situation
I focused my gaze on Chinmoy Soon everything in the chapel except for
his shiny face seemed to disappear Then borrowing a technique
from the Castaneda books I squinted and crossed my eyes until Chinmoy
transformed into swirls of shimmering light Wow I thought
For a moment the distorted image before me reminded me of the Transcendental

When Chinmoy came back into focus he shot a glance at the side
of the chapel A disciple brought him a fresh crate After the
second flickering I took the orange with both hands touched it
to my heart chakra and bowed I walked away feeling grateful
A wave of joy washed over me I saw the disciples including my brother
and Atmananda gazing lovingly at Chinmoy I felt touched by a power
which seemed greater and more romantic than that of the world of reason
How many people get a gift from a fully enlightened guru
I wondered

Dont just stare at it my brother reproved explaining that
oranges were poor retainers of Spiritual Light Eat it

Moments later the Guru announced in a lilting voice
Atmananda pleeeez bring

Atmananda led the five or six potential initiates to the front
of the chapel He had found inspired and persuaded them through
his lectures While Atmananda watched the Guru initiate them
he did not return to his seat Instead he remained in front
several feet away

Chinmoy rapidly oscillated his eyes at the new recruits His eyes were
still flickering when he placed his hand on each of their foreheads
When his eyes returned to normal he flashed a smile at Atmananda
at the new disciples and at the rest of the audience Then he left
the chapel in a flurry of whites and saris

As I watched him leave I felt secure that he and Atmananda knew a lot
about the unknown I glanced across the room at the disciples
I realized that I wanted to be part of their fellowship

My brother and I found Atmananda outside addressing a group
of Stony Brook Chinmoy disciples

Do you want to go with us to Au Natural he asked us

At that moment I would have gone with him anywhere partly because I
was not keen on going home and partly because he was so compelling
There was something about him that felt nurturing yet electric
casual yet happening

Yes we chimed

Atmananda organized rides gave directions warned us about
potholes and drunk drivers and suggested that we maintain
a meditative consciousness lest we lose the Gurus light
Then he led us away from the other Chinmoy disciples from the chapel
from the campus and onto the streets

I watched the blur of city lights from the back of Atmanandas Saab
which hurtled through the streets at a velocity close to that of a
New York taxi He skillfully avoided potholes and drunk drivers
He told my brother of his plan to have Stony Brook disciples advertise
his free public lectures by placing posters in Manhattan I relaxed
believing he was in control

At Au Natural a yogurt shop Atmananda introduced me to the Stony
Brook disciples There were Anne Dana and Suzanne the sariclad
women from his lectures There was Tom a darkhaired young
man who was as tall as Atmananda and who seemed easygoing
There was Sal a balding young man who seemed intense There were
other Chinmoy disciples milling around but the Stony Brook group
stuck together

I expected the conversation would be spiritual seeing as how we
had just meditated with a fully enlightened guru To my surprise
Atmananda and Tom recalled an episode from The Twilight Zone

And he totally disappeared

Into the fifth dimension

Yeah he really got zapped

That night when I got home I wondered if Atmananda should have been
more meditative But I recalled that Don Juan often acted absurd
funny and irreverent He did so to balance the utter seriousness
of The Path as well as to shake up Castanedas preconceived
notions of what it meant to be a seeker Besides I thought
quoting Atmananda who says spirituality cant be fun

The following week I wondered if Chinmoy would accept me as his disciple
I asked my brother what my odds were

If you are drawn to Guru he said the chances are you have studied
with him in past lives But if he sees that hes not the right
teacher for you hell guide you inwardly to the right one

I wanted to believe what my brother and Atmananda had been telling me
I wanted to believe that the Guru installed disciplespecific
invisible channels through which peace light and bliss could
if the disciple were receptive inwardly flow Yet I was not sold
on the theory of reincarnation Nor was I convinced that Atmananda
was fully accurate when he claimed that Chinmoy was the Cosmic Boatman
an avatar incarnation of a Hindu deity and the most advanced soul
ever to have incarnated anywhere in the entire universe

Why would the messiah live in Jamaica Queens I wondered
But then I felt bad After all the Buddha and Christ probably didnt
live in such fancy neighborhoods either I also realized that my doubts
were based on the premise of rationality the very nature of which
Atmananda had taught me was limited flawed and often destructive
I suppose Chinmoy could be the Cosmic Boatman I told myself
as part of a compromise

Days later after one of Atmanandas public lectures I grew curious
about my earlier vision of the snow I asked Atmananda to explain

Your third eye chakra is opening up a bit he explained
matteroffactly You are seeing into another world It is not
unusual to have this type of experience if you have meditated in past lives

Thanks Atmananda I said

Sure kid he said suggesting that I sit back and enjoy the process

Except for occasional doubts I had been enjoying the process
I enjoyed hanging out with the Stony Brook disciples They were
not only fellow seekers but they seemed to have a good time
Atmananda in particular was fun to be around He sometimes made me
feel important and powerful I enjoyed his lectures during which he
quoted The BhagavadGita The Bible Jonathan Livingston Seagull
Star Wars Shakespeare TS Eliot Thoreau Roethke and Carlos Castaneda
One time he even recited my favorite passage from the Castaneda books
the one about traveling on paths that have heart

Now convinced that I had found a home in Atmanandas world
I decided to seek initiation from Chinmoy

My mother knew that my involvement with the group was intensifying
She had been trying to get me to talk to the rabbi

Why should I talk to the rabbi I responded

Will you at least listen to what he has to say

But I had been listening to the rabbi since my bar mitzvah
four years ago and frankly I was not impressed A kind
and sometimes humorous man with a keen intellect the rabbi
represented a religion which seemed less mystical than social
He struck me as being extremely reasonable if not a little dull
In all the years I studied sang and prayed in his congregation
not once as I recall did he capture my imagination

I dont want to talk to the rabbi I had replied

Now I told my mother that I wanted to become a disciple

She grew quiet and pale

I told her that I had had mystical experiences while meditating
with Chinmoy I did not tell her nor did I acknowledge that the
mystical experiences mostly occurred after I crossed or squinted
my eyes or after I gazed at Chinmoy for two minutes or more
I told her that Chinmoy was an enlightened guru and that I
respected him greatly I did not tell her nor did I acknowledge
that my respectmy reverencewas shaped largely by Atmananda
and the other disciples

I was convinced by these reasons So was my brother My parents
were not

Mark would you please talk to the rabbi

I finally agreed to go

When my brother my mother and I entered the bookfilled office
the rabbis expression accentuated by a bulbous nose and glasses
was anything but humorous

Hello Mrs Laxer he said Hello boys

Hello rabbi

He asked us if we were getting involved in another religion

No rabbi explained my brother We are studying spiritual mysticism

Were just learning to meditate I added

I see he said He mentioned an obscure mystical sect within
the Jewish religion known as Cabalism But Judaism he explained
slowly as though measuring each word was based upon laws
not direct mystical experience As he spoke I recalled that Jewish
law had been passed down through the generations since the time
of Abraham and Isaac Chinmoys teachings I realized also stemmed
from a tradition dating back thousands of years I found myself
picturing Chinmoy and Atmananda They are such colorful characters
I thought

I glanced at the rabbi He was saying something about the dangers
of mind control The rabbi is soplain I decided
I felt certain that he had never read the Castaneda books

My mother said little during the meeting She was hoping that
the rabbi would build for my brother and me a framework through
which we could view our mystical quest When the meeting was over
I went home and stared at the underexposed Transcendental photo
of Chinmoy

The next day I tried to meditate but my mind dwelt on familiar thoughts
As soon as I graduate Im going to leave my tired depressed father
Im going to leave my manipulative demanding mother Im going
to follow a path with heart and things are going to get better

Meanwhile my mother had asked if she could attend one of the meetings
with the Guru

Sure I replied I felt I had nothing to hide and I secretly
hoped that she would wish me well on my journey

Dressed in Western clothes she went to St Pauls Chapel that
Wednesday night and sat near the front She felt uncomfortable
being surrounded by a sea of whites and saris She saw disciples
praying to a short Indian man dressed in robes Her stomach became
tense when the man placed his hand on the forehead of her youngest son

I stood in front of the chapel before Chinmoy squinting In the
flickering of the Gurus eyes I was initiated I bowed and turned
and in the audience I saw my mother I quickly looked away
I saw myself less as the son of caring creative and slightly
mixedup New York Jews and more a disciple of the man Atmananda said
was perfect

After initiation I began to spend less time at home where I often
heard things like Artie you talk to your son about what he
is getting involved in

Leave me alone my father replied irritably

Its a rotten family my mother declared

I happily spent time instead with my brother Atmananda and the
other Stony Brook Chinmoy disciples

One time while camping with my brother in a marsh near Stony Brook
my calves began to itch I tried not to scratch what seemed to be
poison ivy but must have done so in my sleep because by morning
the rash had spread

When I went home my mother applied lotion to my skin The next day
she asked if I was better

Yup I said and left for school Confident that my skin would
heal on its own I did not want to make a fuss over the red bumps
which now covered most of my body Yet later that day in writing
class I had to stop reading a poem because I could not get
the words out and my mother arrived and rushed me to the hospital
After a shot of adrenaline caused the puffy quartersized blotches
to shrink the doctor pointed out that had I not been treated in time
I might have been suffocated by the growing bump in my throat

How odd to have a neardeath experience so soon after my
spiritual initiation I thought I asked the doctor what he
thought had nearly killed me Perhaps you had an allergic reaction
to something you ate he said But after various food groups were
one by one reintroduced into my diet the cause of the hives remained hidden

I asked Atmananda what he thought had nearly killed me It is
no coincidence he said mysteriously Whenever you make genuine
spiritual progress the Negative Forces in the universe try and hold
you back But dont worry When you are attacked by the Forces
just think of Guru

I did think of Guru I often doubted though that nefarious
nonphysical Entities from beyond the world of reason were getting
underneath my skin I recalled that Don Juan tricked Castaneda
into pursuing the path to knowledge and wondered if Atmanandas
explanation was a ploy to maneuver me closer to Guru But because I
sought adventure challenge and entrance into the metaphysical worlds
of Don Juan ObiWanKanobi Chinmoy and Atmananda I willfully
suspended my disbelief I also suspended my plans to hitchhike west
After reading a speech at my high school graduation I said
goodbye to friends and family and bought a oneway ticket east
to Stony Brook




4 The Community


HelloAtmananda said my brother into the phone Then he
winced and hung up

Well I asked

I have to call him back he replied sheepishly

How come

He said I didnt have the right spirit

He dialed again Halllooooooo Atmanaaaaaaanda he bellowed
This time Atmananda gave him directions to the party

Weeks before Atmananda gave me permission to attend his parties
provided that I did not vibe the women

Dont look at them as women my brother had suggested
quoting Chinmoy and Atmananda Look at them as seekers
When you look at them as women it hurts their evolution

I assured him I would try

After I moved to Stony Brook I started going to Atmanandas
parties regularly At one party my brother and I arrived at
Toms house left our sneakers by the door and went inside
Atmananda Sal Anne Tom and a few other disciples stood in the kitchen
They looked bewildered The air smelled charred Black gooey gobs
darkened the floor Atmananda was not talking Something was wrong

When Anne had lit the stove moments before an explosion singed her
hair and propelled chocolate and marshmallow covered graham crackers
across the room Now as we cleaned the mess Atmananda began to speak

Guru protected us from the Negative Forces he said in a rich
lulling voice

I told myself that the explosion had probably more to do with the gas
being left on than it did with Guru and the Forces

The Negative Forces want to hurt Gurus mission
Atmananda continued grimly But they know not to challenge
an avatar directly Instead they go after his disciples
particularly those wide open to doubt

For months I had grappled with the concept of Negative Forces
Perhaps they existed I told myself perhaps they did not
In either case I did not take them seriously Now though I tried
to imagine what they looked like I pictured massive menacing storm
clouds in a dark foreboding sky I imagined the clouds were
aware of my current thoughts Suddenly the clouds seemed real
I felt jolted I looked around the room I sensed the disciples had
taken Atmanandas caveat seriously My stomach felt taut I thanked
Chinmoy silently

Atmananda had meanwhile flipped to a less somber mood One of
the best ways to combat the Forces he said is to have fun
So we went out to eat

At an Italian restaurant during one party Atmananda suddenly
slapped Sal on the back and adopting the voice of the Godfather
cried Heyyy Sal You plentyfine kinda guy

Sure Im plentyfine but Im also plentyhungry Sal replied
with an equally zesty accent but without slapping him back

Atmananda then denounced Sal for rescuing a maiden who had been
held against her will in a large vat of ravioli

Whats wrong with that I asked

Sal tell the baby whatsa wrong with that

Until now I had enjoyed their antics but the transition from
being the editorinchief of my high school paper to the baby
felt awkward Yet at seventeen I was the youngest in the group
the average age of which was twentyone Atmananda was twentyseven
And I had learned from Chinmoy and Atmananda that humility was
the quintessential spiritual quality Besides I loved the attention

Sal replied that rescuing maidens was wrong because he should
have been at home meditating

I looked again at Sal a twentyyearold with a large creased forehead
He had studied computer engineering first at CalTech and now
at Stony Brook He also studied guitar and drama He cradled
the eggplant parmigiano hero lovingly in his hands and closed his
eyes before each bite as if bracing for the next dose of ecstasy

Observe the maestro chow hound Atmananda announced

We laughed

Sal had apparently adjusted to his role as chow hound
He continued to eat as if nothing happened

If only Sal could focus on the Infinite rather than on the eggplant
Atmananda noted he would be the first among us to realize God

It was fun eating out with Atmananda After dinner we often
continued the fun and the fight against the Forces at the movies

One time Atmananda took us to Warlords of Atlantis He bought
five buckets of heavily buttered popcorn Tabs Cokes diet Cokes
boxes of licorice Snocaps and Raisinetes Then from the fourth row
Atmananda claimed that four was a power numberwe watched a film which
at the time seemed extraordinary

Atmananda sat by the aisle of the nearly empty theatre He whispered
something to Sal who told Tom who told my brother who told me
Atlantis was once a real city

Atlantis was a real city I told Anne who told Dana who told Suzanne
Meanwhile juxtaposed at an intersection of transmigrating junk food
I further divided my attention between monitoring what needed
to be passed trying not to notice the women and watching a man
on the screen discover a lost world of magic and conflict under the sea

We all had past lives in Atlantis

We had past lives there Pass the Raisinetes A hidden city
of magicians seers and warriors where the laws of physics
do not apply

We were together then

We were together Pass the napkins Crystals have a nonphysical power

Atlantis was destroyed by the greed of its inhabitants

Atlantis was destroyed by greedy people

Afterwards we drove back to Toms and caught the last few minutes of The
Twilight Zone It was late I was getting sleepy Atmananda began
to repeat how Guru had saved us from stovedemolishing Entities
I entered a state of mind where I heard his words but did not
scrutinize them Fifteen or twenty minutes later he suggested
that we meditate on the Transcendental which Tom placed on a table
by the television

In the months that followed Atmananda accepted me into his inner circle
of friends But not every encounter with him I quickly learned
was a party

  

One morning Atmananda emerged from his cottage in Stony Brook carrying
a thick stack of posters Bluejays doves sparrows and chickadees
flocked around a feeder Sal Paul my brother and I stood nearby
Atmananda approached but the little birds remained

Ellaow he said in a Cockney accent

Ellaow we echoed

WHATis your name he demanded quoting from the movie Monty
Python and the Holy Grail

Sir Waffnoid offered Sal

WHATis your quest

I seek the higher worlds

WHATwere you thinking about last night at 1130

Sal blushed

Alas my lad said Atmananda patting him on the shoulder
You wont reach the higher worlds thinking about that

Atmananda showed us a poster It read ECSTASY AS A WAY OF LIFE
Also printed were details about a free lecture series
With AtmanandaDr Frederick Lenz But before he sent us
to Manhattan Atmananda inspired us told us how to protect ourselves
how to change

Gurus mission he said in a pacifying voice is to bring peace
light and bliss into a world that is rapidly heading towards darkness

I realized that it was largely through Atmanandas lectures and through
his appearances on radio and televisionincluding a recent appearance
on the Phil Donahue Showthat Chinmoys mission was being spread
I felt important that I was a part of the operation

Your task is to see where to place the posters so that they
will be noticed by advanced seekers To do this you will need
to maintain a very high state of consciousness

We nodded solemnly

If you run into religious fanatics be polite but firm
Do not let them engage you in conversation

We nodded again

By postering you are helping Guru bring light into this world
But Negative Forces will sense this and will try to inject you
with doubts If you are attacked by the Forces cry inwardly
to Guru

I was not too worried about nonphysical creatures on the prowl
I had a great deal of selfconfidence I assumed the Guru would
protect me and I wasnt convinced that Atmanandas ghosts
were real

I see that many will be helped as a result of todays efforts
provided that Sal can muster the willpower to work and not just eat
he said smiling warmly And dont forget to have a good time

We meditated a moment

Guru put a special force on the posters Atmananda said
breaking the silence and handing the stack to my brother
Then he strutted around us in a silly walk which I recognized
from a Monty Python skit

Cheeriao

Cheeriao we echoed waddling down the driveway imitating his imitation
On the way to the train station his words reverberated in my mind
the path spiritual awareness see sea of consciousness
dreamtime vibrations energy chakra subtle metaphysical
pyschic unseen forces traps Entities light and darkness
The language defined for me a world in which I chose at each moment
between good and evil Put that way there was not much of a choice
I believed now that ours was a pure and noble quest and that I was
a warrior of Truth not a casualty of rhetoric

On the train ride into the city I sat next to Paul a happygolucky
Swede with blond hair a broad grin and a magnetlike attraction
for devices that were electronic We both were Stony Brook freshmen
who had learned about Chinmoy through Atmanandas lectures
We both sensed that there was something out there beyond the surface
world of reason We both intended to do something about it

Whats the penguin doing on the tehlee he quipped quoting from
Monty Python Green and grey scenes of Long Island sped by through
the trains window frame

The penguin on the tehlee I squawked is about to blow up

Tickets tickets announced the conductor All tickets please

I remembered how as a kid I rode the trains without paying
I had stayed ahead of the ticket collector gotten off when I
reached the front car and then caught the next train But
now I no longer believed in free rides It did not matter
that the Ultimate Destination could not according to Atmananda
be described using words I still felt that I should pay to get there
By postering I was not only paying for myself but was affording
thousands the opportunity to be taken for a ride of their own
I handed the conductor my ticket

My brother and Sal sat across from us Their backs were straight
their eyes closed I too tried to meditate but could not
Instead I thought about my parents I had followed Atmanandas
suggestion and told them that I was studying spiritual mysticism
Nonetheless they seemed convinced that their sons were getting
sucked into a cult I was sensitive to their reaction to me
and intentionally saw them less as the weeks went by

I also thought about Chinmoy He had instructed followers to memorize
four of his disciplepublished books I opened one and read
When you choose you lose Chinmoy it seemed believed that major
decisions should be left to the Supreme his favorite word for what
Atmananda called the Infinite which the Rabbi had referred to as God

Help Guru I thought doubting I could memorize the numerous
aphorisms without divine intervention

Penn Station Penn Station came the reply Last stop

We left the train and were funneled onto the escalator by the crowd
Paul and my brother headed uptown on Third Avenue while Sal and I
worked Second Avenue Dodging cars bicycles and more crowds
we entered a supermarket and found the manager

Excuse me sir Sal said sweetly We are sponsoring a workshop
on relaxation and were wondering if we could place this in your window

One of the posters is already outdated I pointed out
So we wont have to take up more of your window space

The manager looked us over glanced at the poster and nodded

Thanks we said and quickly placed two back to back visible to people
inside and out After several hours we had placed more than half the stack

Postering with Sal boosted my confidence in asking favors
from strangers Soon though we decided to work opposite sides
of the street to increase our efficiency I found that by acting
polite and a bit shy I could easily persuade store owners to say yes
The more I spread the word of Gurus mission to people in stores
and on the street the more I believed in it And the more I believed
the more I wanted to spread the word of Gurus mission

When Sal and I ran out of posters we crossed over to Third Avenue
met Paul and my brother and caught the subway to Penn Station
I was tired from the postering I found the repetitive clatter
and vibrations of the train soothing I found it easy to meditate
I could have thought about how Atmananda had been teaching me
howtohuntandhownottobehunted I could have thought about how
those who teach howtohuntandhownottobehunted can easily prey
upon those whom they teach I could have thought about how by asking
Atmananda to take me beyond the world of reason I was hunting him
I could have thought about how he was hunting me But I just sat there
and let my thoughts run free

That year Sal Paul Tom my brother and I placed thousands
of posters in Manhattan Working with Anne Dana and Suzanne
we also distributed thousands of handouts on the Stony Brook campus
Sometimes we worked in subfreezing temperatures Once Atmananda had us
glue posters on buildings in Manhattan in the middle of the night
I did not mind I tended to enjoy the effort in part because I
believed we were doing some good because we had plenty of time
to pursue other interests in January 1979 I began studying English
literature at Stony Brook and because as hard as we worked
we played

  

The Muppet Movie I asked after another full day of postering
Starring KermittheFrog

Trust me Atmananda replied

Trust was the bridge to Atmanandas world a peculiar improbable place
where it snowed inside buildings in Manhattan in the spring
where invisible beings threatened a gurus mission by blowing
up stoves and where people were hunters or hunted or both
It felt natural to trust a man who treated me with kindness
who exuded an aura of competency and of vulnerability and who seemed
wholeheartedly dedicated to the cause of selfimprovement

We met at a theatre where we ate popcorn and candy in the fourth row
I told Atmananda that the postering had gone well The lights faded
and the movie began

A Hollywood agent on a fishing trip strikes up a conversation
with KermittheFrog The agent is impressed with him and suggests
that he move west to Hollywood

Though seemingly content in his East Coast swamp Kermit is taken
by the agents prediction that as a movie star he could make
millions of people happy Make millions of people happy
echoes the starryeyed muppet

The scene reminded me of my former plan to hitchhike west on
a mystical quest The plan seemed less glamorous now because I
had already found a teacher and because of Atmanandas prediction
He often told me that had he not rescued me from that path I would
have been shot by bandits and tossed in a ditch Perhaps though
the former plan would have regained some momentum had I known about
and had I analyzed the problems currently fouling the air between
Chinmoy and Atmananda

One problem was sex Chinmoy who taught that higher consciousness
lay above the sweaty world of physical pleasure often instructed
us to avoid members of the opposite sex whenever possible

In contrast Atmananda told me I once had several girlfriends
at the same timeeach named Susan

There was the problem of ego Chinmoy emphasized over and over
the importance of humility

Atmananda often pointed out to his inner circle of friends
that in a past life he was Sir Thomas More

There was the problem of cinema Guru prohibited the viewing
of sexually explicit or violent movies

Atmananda had his own view which was to see them As a result
I got to see such films as Rocky Horror Picture Show Dawn of the Dead
and Apocalypse Now

There was the problem of expression of individuality In an attempt
to merge with the Beyond many disciples decorated their often
sparse homes with Gurus paintings posters and photographs

In contrast Atmanandas plushly carpeted colorful cottage
gave me the sense that he rearranged the space until the lines
connecting the physical and nonphysical dimensions meshed nicely
By the front door two ferns thrived beside an electronic synthesizer
By a stainedglass window hung a photograph of Atmananda with
a toucan on his shoulder The toucan died he once told me
but its soul is advanced and will soon take on a human incarnation
Multicolored rug segments covered the stairs to the loft where a
largerthanlife Transcendental stared down from the slanted ceiling
directly over his bed

And there was the problem that Stony Brook disciples learned
the language of spirituality and of dreams less from Chinmoy than Atmananda

Able to speak at length about anything and nothing Atmananda often did
For him reality seemed to consist of an infinite number of levels
which were interconnected in obvious and in not so obvious ways

Words are used to describe these levels but are extremely limited
he explained Nonetheless I often found myself tripping on his
words from the world of the bizarre to the world of the sensible
and back again I became familiar with the diversity of his language
during his lectures and perhaps more so during his parties

Auuuuummmmmmmmmmmmm he chanted after a twentyfive minute meditation
at the start of one party He slowly bowed and touched his forehead
to the floor which is where he sat along with the rest of us
Then the Stony Brook disciples stoked the fireplace set the tablecloth
on the floor grated cheese and emptied bags of tortilla chips
I watched the disciples work Only months had passed since
the exploding stove episode and yet I felt close to them
There was Atmananda He was orchestrating the festivities
He had brought us all together There was my brother He looked happy
He did not seem to mind me tagging along There was Sal
His intense nature seemed balanced by a fabulous sense of humor
There was Tom the tall easygoing bass guitar player He would
soon receive a degree in history from Stony Brook He seemed to be
good friends with Atmananda And there was Paul He and I were
becoming friends

Then there were the women According to Guru I was not even supposed
to look them in the eye I tried to protect them from my wayward
sexual thoughts but sometimes in my imagination I did more than
just look Then I felt bad I was told that they would now have
to meditate extra hard to cleanse themselves of such lower energy
I wished that we could be friends They seemed so nice

Rachel with light brown hair and perceptive eyes was closer
in age to Atmananda than the rest of us She had completed
medical school in three years and become a disciple in 1978
two months after attending Atmanandas lectures at the New School
for Social Research in Manhattan

Dana a onetime fashion model had been an occupational therapy
major at Canadas McGill University She first met Atmananda while
interviewing him for the campus radio station After the interview
which touched on Atmanandas book Lifetimes True Accounts
of Reincarnation he invited her to visit him in Stony Brook
Shortly thereafter she left her boyfriend family school and country
She moved to Stony Brook just around the block from the charismatic
young meditation teacher and author

Connie was a waitress with long dark braids a Midwesterners
friendliness and a cheeky smile

Suzanne had long brown hair and dreamy eyes She studied art
at the Parsons School of Design in Manhattan

And Anne with long black hair and that playful impish grin
was studying to be a nurse

I turned back to watch Atmananda Dont think that spirituality is
divorced from the physical world he was saying as he reached for a chip
After you meditate a few years you begin to see that Annam Brahma
food is God He then set the chipsandcheeseladen tray in the oven

Sal observed intently as though witnessing a ritual

Soon Atmananda and Sal were delivering trays of crunchy nachos
I garnished mine with sour cream to alleviate the delicious
consciousness altering burn of the hot sauce As we ate
I felt proud that I had managed to stop thinking about the women
Then I had to tell myself to be careful lest my ego swell instead
Finally I told myself to relax Which I did The food
the crackling fireplace and the medieval trumpet and recorder
music reminded me of something distant intangible and noble
My spirit soared

The kid and I are going to write some songs for you
Atmananda announced

I looked at him perplexed After all I was no longer the baby
but the kid

He motioned for me to follow him upstairs

I immediately assumed that my brother would be right beside me when I
climbed those stairs him first and then me But he just sat there
boosting my confidence with a faraway smile

I nearly told Atmananda to write the song with my brother
Instead I chose instead to go with the flow I climbed

If you are going to study English Atmananda told me you might as
well get used to putting together words He grinned mischievously
Lets write songs about Sal

At first he was the driving force behind the creative process
I merely smiled at each of his ideas Later though I came
up with a few lines of my own which seemed to blend with his
and after about fortyfive minutes we marched triumphantly downstairs
and sang together



 Soul of Sal
 sung to the tune of O Sole Mio


 Ohhhh soul of Sal
 Aspire tonight
 Dont be a shmucko
 Manifest Light
 Tomorrowmay be too late
 Now is never
 My gazpacho she cannot a wait

 Now is the right time
 The food delight time
 So open up a you mouth
 And face the south

 Tomorrowmay be too late
 Now is never
 My gazpacho she cannot a wait



We sang and danced around Sal who tried to maintain a dignified
countenance but who ended up laughing along with the rest of us
Then Rachel made cinnamonspiced hot apple cider and we sat around
the fire sipping the brew Later Atmananda sang a revised version
of I Don Quixote from Man of La Mancha



 Hear me heathens and wizards
 and servants of sin
 All your dastardly doings are past
 For a holy endeavor is now to begin

 I am I Atmanandathe humble and pure
 My destiny calls and I go
 And the wild winds of fortune
 shall carry me onward
 Oh whither soever they blow


 Whither soever they blow
 Onward to glory I go



After the performance Atmananda said that the level of our consciousness
was dropping so he had us meditate for about twenty minutes
Then he said We are going to play The Game

What game I asked feeling bolder after having performed with him

Part of The Game he replied cryptically is to figure out
what The Game is

The Game is The Intuition Game said Sal You want
us to intuit something

Right

I wondered if Sal could read Atmanandas mind

Some of you think that you can read my mind Atmananda said
peering at Sal But you can read only those thoughts that I make
available to you

Sal had intuited that we had to intuit something but we still did
not know what it was

Is it about the past asked Anne

When you intuit The Truth you get an answer not a question
Atmananda stated

Its about the future stated Dana

Right

You want us to look into the future she continued

He nodded

I see you traveling around the world giving lectures she predicted

Many seekers will become disciples as a result of your talks
offered Tom

Guru will be happy with us suggested Anne

Were going to put up a lot of posters I added

Atmananda said that we had done well but were forgetting
something important

We looked at him expectantly

Then in his KermittheFrog voice he said Were going to make
millions of people happy

Make millions of people happy I echoed

Chinmoy seemed willing to look the other way when Atmananda
his chief recruiter disregarded his etiquette on sex ego cinema
individuality and language But his patience ran out in 1979
when a Queens disciple informed him that Atmananda was playing guru
Actually it had been several months since Atmananda had made it
a practice to scan the audience during the meditation part of his talks
as if he were channeling Divine Light But now Chinmoy saw the light
and Atmananda was in immediate danger of being kicked out of the Centre

When Atmananda learned of his predicament he had an idea
Fond of temperate climates he had been wanting for years to move back
to his birthplace sunny southern California This dream had recently
reasserted itself in his mind as the number of people attending
his talks gradually dwindled which he attributed to a diminishing
interest in spirituality in the New York metropolitan area
But suddenly the idea of starting a Chinmoy Centre in a distant city
seemed less of a dream than a necessity He wrote Guru a letter
asking if he could move to San Diego

Chinmoy consented

Weeks later the phone rang It was Atmananda

I offered to find my brother

No he said I want to speak with you Why dont you come over

He lived about a quarter of a mile from my apartment in Stony Brook
I jogged down Cedar Street and knocked on his door

Hi kid Make yourself at home He offered me a yogurt

I accepted

He told me that he was starting a Centre for Guru in La Jolla California
Then in an enchantingly anesthetizing voice he explained that southern
California rested upon a mystical power spot around which had congregated
the nations largest population of spiritual seekers Would you like to go

I realized that San DiegoSan Diegowas driving distance
to the Sonoran Desert and to UCLACastanedas frequent haunts
I remembered Atmananda telling me that California boasted many lovely
friendly women I realized that such a move would distance me
from my parents who continued to worry that I was in a cult
I also realized that such a move would distance me from Guru
But I now believed that the Light would reach me in whichever state
I inhabited Besides I sensed that without Atmananda as a buffer
Chinmoys highly regimented brand of spirituality would be difficult
if not impossible for me to conform to

And what a buffer Atmananda was I pictured him striding about
with his chin jutting forward exuding that aura of confidence
joking and singing inspiring and enlivening us challenging our
intellects with the known and unknowable framing and reframing the way
in which we viewed the world and generating mystical experiences
not on his own of course but with the Gurus Spiritual Light

Yes I replied without considering the feelings of my brother
who continued to support me in my quest with a faraway smile
I was proud that Atmananda had chosen me to be part of his team
I did not know however that he had embellished stories in his
book Lifetimes Nor did I know that he had told the San Francisco
Examiner that he never experienced a past life remembrance
Nor did I know that he had once asked a girlfriend to slip
out the window when another appeared at the door
Nor that he had recently been in deep trouble with Chinmoy
Nor that during the height of the controversy he had admitted
to Tom that he might leave the Centre before Chinmoy kicked
him out

What would you do if you left Tom had asked him

Id move to California and teach meditation Atmananda replied

On August 30 1979 Atmananda Dana Rachel Connie and I left
the ground in a jet bound for San Diego In the excitement
of packing and leaving I had forgotten my wallet and daypack
back at my brothers Now without money or ID I watched
rays of light play off darkening clouds and thought about the frog




5 Bicycle RideLenox


The weather had cleared since I had started pedaling west from Walden
Pond five days before but headwinds continued to press both the
doggiecarrier and bicycletrailer as if I were tugging a parachute
Contributing little to the weight of the rig was a book by William
Shirer on Mahatma Gandhi Disillusioned but not yet ready to live
without heroes I actively sought a replacement for Atmananda

I rode over the mountains of western Massachusetts and rolled
into the town of Lenox There a woman noticed the oddness
of my entourage and asked What exactly is going on

I am bicycling across America with my dog I replied

Ten minutes later she was interviewing me in a nearby cafe
She was a reporter for the Berkshire Eagle and as I answered
her questions I thought about how I would answer when she asked
me why I realized it was more than a love for bicycling
more than a longing for adventure and more than a desire
to strengthen my selfconfidence that propelled me west
I wanted time to think about Atmanandas thousands of lessons
some of which I sensed were valid and some of which I knew were not

There was another reason I wanted to do something distinctly
me Bicycling across a continent against the prevailing winds
with all my possessions and a Siberian huskythat was me

Why she asked later

I tempered my answer with the knowledge that I was being interviewed
by a journalist and not a shrink At one point I told her that I
was traveling with a book on Gandhi

Do you like it she asked

While reading the book I felt proud that Gandhi had been deeply
influenced by Thoreaus essay Civil Disobedience proud that a
thinker and experimenter from the United States had had an effect
on one from India whose thoughts and experiments affected humankind
But it was more than pride which attracted me to Shirers Gandhi
A Memoir Gandhis dream of helping the masses reminded me of
Atmanandas seeming interest in making millions of people happy
While Gandhi wielded influence over twothirds of a billion people
as he helped India secure independence never did he grow twisted
by the enormity of his own power never did he betray the public trust
Though Atmananda eloquently described the balance between the spiritual
and the mundane I knew from years of firsthand experience
yet found it difficult to admitthat a Mahatma Gandhi he
was not

I like the book very much I replied

Would you like to meet Shirer she offered

William L Shirer was the only correspondent sent by an American
newspaper to cover Indias revolution He gathered that Gandhis
philosophy encompassed more than civil disobedience passive resistance
noncooperation and nonviolence but had to do also with
something more subtleand fundamental the search for truth
for the essence of the spirit Insights such as this made him
seem particularly suited to investigate so complex and sensitive
a matter as Indias social political and spiritual ferment
Shirer was also the author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich
A History of Nazi Germany As I knocked on his door I hoped that
with his knowledge of benevolent and malevolent charismatic leaders
he could help me to understand Atmananda

I wanted to tell Shirer that I had seen Atmanandas seemingly tightknit
community transform into a group of fearful paranoid people
I wanted to tell him that I had seen Atmananda himself transform from
a seemingly kind and noble seeker into a man who used antipsychotic
drugs and LSD as tools of persuasion whowithout the use of drugs
persuaded one woman to leave her husband and newborn child
who dreamt of filling stadiums and of starting a world religion
who claimed to be the antiChrist and who spoke repeatedly of
taking the inner circle for a ride in a Learjet into a mountain
I wanted to tell Shirer how in 1984 I had helped Atmananda through
a bad LSD trip and how as he was coming down I had observed
his opposing personalities reassert themselves I wanted to tell
him that Atmananda seemed to be getting progressively worse
And I wanted to tell him how Atmananda had persuaded one disciple
that he and I would be forever locked in a battle over mystical power
The disciple was my brother

When Shirer answered the door his large bright forehead and serene
countenance made him appear intellectually and spiritually advanced
and I had an uncanny feeling that something of the Mahatma himself
peered out at me through those eightythreeyearold eyes

What can I do for you he asked me

I wanted to tell you that Im enjoying your book I said
suddenly aware that he might not want to discuss the extremities
of human nature with a total stranger I told him about the bike trip
his book on Gandhi and the reporter But he was busy preparing
for a lecture tour of Russia and had no time to talk I thanked him
got back on my bicycle and left

I pictured Shirer as a young man contemplating the life and lessons
of Mahatma Gandhi I also pictured him observing uniformed men
with swastikas bent on genocide I imagined him accepting both
good and bad in people for only by cultivating acceptance did I
imagine him harvesting peace But I realized as I pedaled north
that I would have to learn to distinguish between the nurturing and
noxious roots Atmananda had sown in my mind without Shirers help
This was something I would have to do for myself

I continued to ride towards Pittsfield Massachusetts with Frank
a childhood friend Tall with messy red hair he was an expert
car mechanic though he never made much money This was in part
because he was a slow worker because he had little selfconfidence
and because people took advantage of him

Hows work going I asked him

Okay I suppose

I knew that he was making less than six dollars an hour
Have you thought about looking for a higher paying job
I asked

He shrugged

You know youre being ripped off

He shrugged again We had been through this conversation before
I wanted to teach Frank that he was like a sitting duck that he
could protect himself that he could changesuddenly I froze
I remembered that Atmananda had taught us that we were like
sitting ducks that we could protect ourselves that we could
change




6 The Garden


Southern Californians have been exposed to more New Age
teachers than perhaps any population in the United States
Yet the forty or so people seemed unprepared for Atmananda
who strode into the lecture hall twenty minutes late with a can
of diet soda in one hand and a pack of green gum in the other

I assumed that many of the Birkenstockclad seekers drank natural
fruit juice and did not chew gum

This evening Id like for you all to hold hands and be
like reeeally mellowwww said Atmananda mimicking
the way some people spoke in San Diegos flourishing holistic community

There was tense laughter A few people left

Those who take themselves too seriously on the path to enlightenment
Atmananda said in a more dignified tone tend not to get very far

I felt good knowing that I did not take myself too seriously

From the spiritual point of view he said later on eating junk
food is fineas long as you do so in moderation and as long as you
exercise regularly

Jaws dropped I figured that many of them ate unprocessed rice
and seaweed

When the meditation began Atmananda played fastpaced electronic
music by Tangerine Dream

More jaws dropped I surmised that many of them meditated to flute
and chime melodies

During the meditation Atmananda briefly gazed at each person
in the audience as if he were sending them Spiritual Light

I closed my eyestried to slow my thoughtsopened my eyes
gazed intensely at Atmanandaperceived light emanating from his
eyeskept gazing without blinkingperceived the entire room
go white

How many of you saw Light in the room he asked several minutes later

No response

Be honest now

I raised my hand

Why dont you describe what you saw Mark

I did

Mark has been studying advanced meditation techniques with us
for over a year But you dont have to be advanced to have
mystical experiences Whobesides Markgot zapped

A few raised their hands

I think you all got so blasted Atmananda said that you dont
know what hit you

After the talk many of the people came forward with questions
I wanted to watch Atmananda work his charm but I knew that I had a task
to perform Weeks earlier he had instructed me If you see a guy
at a workshop trying to pick up a lady move right in and engage him
in conversation This will give her the opportunity to walk away
and maintain a high level of consciousness

Do you know what women at the lectures really want They want to get
closer to God They may think that they want relationships with men
But if they choose that world believe me their inner beings will
be miserable

I did not ask how he proposed to relate to them

The tricky part he added is to do this without letting either
one know what is going on He was silent awhile and I sensed
there was more he wanted to tell me

Why dont more women attain enlightenment he finally sighed
Because they are taught in a maledominated society to marry
have children and serve their husbands Traditionally they have not
had the opportunity to study with an enlightened teacher

I was moved by the truth that I felt in his words and now
as he answered questions in the front of the room I interrupted
conversations with all the speed and savvy I could muster
People did not seem to mind On the contrary they seemed to regard
me as someone special as if I were on The Busand they were trying
to get on

With each passing week Atmananda further opened the audience to
the possibility that they could evolve countless lifetimes by staring
at the underexposed photo of a balding man After about a month
he announced Those who are interested in the advanced side
of selfdiscovery should ask Mark for a map to the Centre

The Centre was Atmanandas term for the San Diego branch
of Chinmoys organization It was also his term for the house
he now shared with me and the three other Chinmoy disciples
Atmananda had not needed a map to the Centre months before on the day
that the five of us moved west He had seemed to know the way
Theres Mission Bay he said pointing to bright green lawns bordering
light blue water When he exited the freeway which he assured us
was free I noticed groundcover plants surrounding and dividing
the road like armies of fat green spiders On La Jolla Scenic Road
I saw more exotic flora tall cedarlike trees plants with huge
veincovered leaves and cacti with yellow flowers and spiny needles
I did not know their names

At last boomed Atmananda pointing to a large shrub which drooped
like a wilted phallus We have found the fabled swaaaanso bush

I laughed nervously at his fabrication and glanced at Dana who sat
beside me Only minutes ago she and I had sat outside the San Diego
airport terminal caressed by a balmy breeze waiting for Atmananda
and Rachel to rent a car It was the first time we had been alone
My heart pounded and I unsuccessfully tried not to watch the way
in which her breasts pressed against her blouse

She ran her fingers through her hair and smiled at me

I wanted so much to kiss her to tell her that she was beautiful
to love her Had I followed my gut feelings Atmananda might
have sent me back to New York on the next available flight
But Chinmoy and Atmananda had explained that sex saps psychic growth
And I was concerned that Atmananda and Dana might be in some sort
of relationship already Besides I never had had a girlfriend and
was at a loss as to what to say I paused and Atmananda and Rachel
appeared with the rental car

Atmananda often displayed an extraordinary sensitivity toward
what people around him were thinking and now as we approached
the Centre for the first time I wondered if he had timed
his arrival back at the airport based on my wayward desire
I also wondered how to diffuse my crush on Dana

Dont worry I told myself Guru will help me work it out

Now Atmananda told his passengers that the new Centre was only a few
blocks away He had chosen a house on Cliffridge Avenue where
in the name of the Guru we would fight evil forces and make
millions happy Before turning left on Cliffridge we drove past
Nottingham and Robin Hood

The lawns in the neighborhood seemed like tiny golf courses
Atmananda pulled into one of the driveways got out of the car
and said Here we are Then he strode down the path as though
leading us to his castle

He claimed the master bedroom which overlooked the garden
Danas was next to his Then mine Then Connies Then Rachels

Welcome to Atmanandas bar and grill he grinned from behind
the kitchen counter pretending to serve us

Adjacent to the kitchen was the meditation room where Atmananda
planned to conduct weekly meetings for the soontoberecruited
Chinmoy disciples From the meditation room I could see the long
narrow yard and the large wooden deck which he christened the
flogging platform On the steep hill past the deck legions of
spidery plants advanced imperceptibly toward the garden

Nearly every day during the first few weeks in San Diego Atmananda drove
us to La Jolla Shores Beach There he led Rachel Dana and me
to where the water was over our heads Connie was intimidated
by the Pacific surf and did not immerse herself the way the rest
of us did With Atmanandas guidance however that would soon change

Two years before in New York Atmananda and Tom had tried to swim
across a channel in the Long Island Sound Though a strong swimmer
Tom grew fatigued fighting the swift current and Atmananda risked
his life to save his friend from being swept to sea

Now buoyed by Atmanandas legendary strength I rode the swells
beyond the breakers to where my feet dangled above the ocean floor
After thirty minutes or so we rode the waves toward the shore
At this time Atmananda often disappeared beneath the surface
We stood there in the waistdeep water waiting watching and trying
to figure out his next movewhen suddenly there was a scream
Still underwater Atmananda had seized and was tickling someones
foot

Then we sat on the beach soothed by gentle currents of the herbscented air
I looked to the west Blue on blue stretched across the horizon
I looked to the east White buildings gleamed behind a row
of tall healthy palms I remembered Atmanandas advice
If you want to live in a pretty world just cry inwardly to Guru
I could not help but feel that I had entered one of Dr Seuss
fantasygardens for children

Atmananda drove us back to the Centre where we gazed for forty minutes
or so at the Transcendental Then we ate nachosa perfect ending
I thought to a perfect day I was so absorbed in having fun with
my new family I did not think to contact my parents or my brother

Several days after we arrived in southern California
Atmananda took us on a bus tour of the San Diego Zoo in Balboa Park
The guide pointed to an elephant and said This is Peanuts
Peanuts has been with us for seven years

This guy is making it up as he goes whispered Atmananda
who seemed to resent having someone else control the conversation

The guide pointed to a giraffe This is

Fwazznoid interrupted Atmananda loudly

and Puzzles has been with us for three years continued the guide
trying to ignore the man monkeying around with the four laughing hyenas

One time during our first few weeks in California Atmananda saw me
standing on a wall in the yard He later told me that he had seen
me fly

Really I said

Yes he replied I saw your Astral Body hovering over the canyon

Wow

Suddenly his kind encouragement transmogrified into a cold
penetrating glare I felt he was looking right through me

I can see that you still doubt me he said turning away

I was upset with myself As usual he was right Yet I sensed
there was something more something in the way he looked at me

But he was smiling now Dont let it bother you kid Youre doing fine

Whew I thought happy to forget about it

Perhaps Atmananda had been happy to forget about it too because he
began giving me other things to think about He gave me the task
for instance of starting a meditation club at my new school
the University of California at San Diego UCSD He understood
that by controlling a university club he gained legitimacy
prestige and unlimited access to free lecture halls

I saw no harm in Atmanandas request We were after all
using the club to help Guru So I set out to find three fulltime
students who were willing to sign up as the clubs officers

Hi I said approaching one student Im starting a meditation
club and was wondering if you might be interested in helping out

Whats a meditation club

Were going to have guest lecturers teach Zen and relaxation
you know stuff like that

Sounds cool dude but Im already relaxed

Greatbut maybe you could take a moment and help people who are not
And so by soliciting signatures from those not particularly
interested in meditation I became the clubs sole proprietor

Meanwhile Dana designed Rachel mostly payed for and Atmananda
zapped the new stack of posters which I then placed around UCSD
San Diego State University SDSU and the neighboring communities
The talks went well and I soon handed out many maps to the Centre

Before the potential recruits arrived Connie spent hours cleaning
the Centre According to Atmananda this was something her soul
loved to do My soul he pointed out loved to greet people

HowdyIm Mark I said

Hello she replied She was graceful and alluring Im Mandy

This one I thought is gonna need some heavy protecting

During the lecture Atmananda predicted that the world would enter
a spiritual dark age in 1985 The darkness will last for thousands
of years and it will become increasingly difficult to meditate
and to think clearly Spiritual warriors will need to band together
under the protection of a guru who can fight the Negative Forces
and forge a path toward freedom and Light through a world turned
murky and grey Then we had cookies

After several public meetings at the Centre Atmananda invited
those who were interested in studying with Chinmoy to stay afterwards

What do you do for a living Atmananda asked each of the three

Im a flight attendant said Mandy

I know a few things about flying Atmananda interjected

I cane chairs said a woman with long brown hair

I cane people said a man with a crewcut

If you sincerely want to take the next step in your spiritual evolution
Atmananda said we will mail your photographs to Guru
Guru will use his psychic vision to see if you are meant to study
with him

By the time Chinmoy accepted the flight attendant the craftsperson
and the marine there were many more applicants to be processed

Despite the intensity of the recruitment drive Atmananda found time
to assist certain seekers on a oneonone basis Mandy in particular
must have exhibited potential because he often spent nights
at her condo

I figured it was okay for Atmananda to sleep with Mandy
though it was not okay for me to appreciate her beauty He was
after all an advanced disciple and knew a lot more about these
things than I He said on occasion that I could have a girlfriend
outside the Centre but mostly he said that I shouldnt
My perceptions might have changed however had I known that he
was sleeping with numerous women disciples My perceptions
also might have changed had I known about the Bedroom Incident

When Atmananda first flew with Rachel to La Jolla in search of a rental
he chose a house with good vibesbut with only four bedrooms
He told Rachel that he would take the large bedroom that she
would take the dining room and living room areas and that they
would switch

But he never allowed her to use the living room Nor would he switch
To complicate matters he often sat outside her makeshift bedroom
advising disciples through the night and early morning how they could
accelerate their march toward a wordless perfection

Unlike Atmananda Rachel had to wake up in the morning and go to work
After too many nights of too little sleep she grew tired angry
and confused

When Atmananda sensed that she was not her usual happy self he did
not openly communicate his displeasure Instead he ignored her
He let the other women know that she was in a bad consciousness and
should be avoided whenever possible He began to treat her as if she
were an outsider

Rachel grew increasingly flustered She reached out in her thoughts
to Guru to family and to friends When Atmananda asked her
to move out of the house she breathed an exhausted sigh of relief

In the meantime without a clue I studied literature worked
parttime read Gurus books meditated oneandahalf hours a day
tried to see organized poster teams attended Atmanandas talks
and immersed myself each day in water over my head
I felt so good about my life and the community I was helping
to build that it seemed like I was living in paradise




7 Money Mantra


Arriving carless in California Atmananda thought about continuing his
career as a college professor He thought about writing another book
He even considered going to law school Instead he expanded
the Money Club

The Money Club had started in New York when Atmananda began
collecting from Stony Brook disciples We voluntarily gave a few
dollars a month to offset the cost of the posters

In San Diego he raised membership dues to four or so dollars
a week Rachel who took out loans to help the San Diego Chinmoy
Centre get started gave much more As The Centre rapidly grew
so did the numbers in Atmanandas club

Seekers used to live in monasteries and in caves Atmananda taught at
Centre meetings But Guru recommends that instead we live in a city
This gives us the opportunity to strengthen our psychic defenses
and to better serve humanity In order to live in the world
particularly as your consciousness evolves and as the vibrations
of the world grow darker you will need money

Most of the new disciples though were UCSD undergraduates
when Atmananda explained the etiquette of selfless givingYou
can give in the right way or you can give in the wrong way
many of us wondered how we could give in any way

But Atmananda had an idea He suggested that we take out student
loans for more than we actually needed

You can then donate the extra amount to a worthy cause he pointed out
To a genuine spiritual centre for instance

It was no coincidence that the Centres finances improved significantly
after banks issued checks for guaranteed student loans

Atmananda had another idea

Accepting money from your parents is the spiritual thing to do
Why not give your parents the opportunity to help Why shouldnt they
be given the opportunity to make spiritual progress

He even devised a way that we could earn money

Why work for five dollars an hour when you could be making twenty
Work is not supposed to be fun Believe me they would not be paying you
if it was Unless you already have a career that you are happy with
you should study computer science

Most of you developed software back in Atlantis back when computers
were far more advanced than they are today Keeping track of all
those variables will help you strengthen your mind Besides
programming pays extremely well after a relatively short period of time

Atmananda interspersed talk of raising consciousness and money with
stories from the rich world of his imagination He told stories
for instance about a legendary character that he called The Gwid

The Gwid is close friends with Roshi Megabucks he said
stroking his chin and smiling The Gwid leases all of reality
to God

At one Centre meeting a UCSD anthropology graduate student pointed
out that millions in the world were starving Shouldnt we
be doing something to help she asked

On the surface Atmananda replied Elizabeth is asking a perfectly
legitimate question But if you could see you would have detected
the underlying hostility in her tone

The room filled with uneasy silence

But that is why we study meditation he went on We are constantly
striving to perfect our different selves

He slowly scanned the disciples Many of you send Guru
hostile vibrations in the inner worlds so dont hide behind
your holierthanthou facade It isnt necessary We understand

He turned back to Elizabeth his sarcastic pout transforming into
a compassionate smile There are many who are suited for helping
the poor What we do here is help people on a higher level
He went on to provide a framework through which to view poverty
Each soul he explained chooses the circumstance of its birth so that it
can best work out its karma

At first Elizabeths question struck a chord in me
But I associated her question with Atmanandas accusation
that many of us were sending hostile vibes to Guru
This made me upset so I tried to think about something else
But there was something else I was trying not to think about

Has anyone noticed that I have been going into advanced states
of consciousness Atmananda had started to ask at the Centre meetings

At first there had been no response

The powers from my past lives are returning he continued
in a sinceresounding voice My consciousness is cycling
Those of you who can see will easily feel The Change

Several disciples nodded as though for the first time they were
feeling The Change

I knew that if I gazed at him intensely for several minutes I saw auras
in whichever hue I imagined Nonetheless I had not detected The Change
I wanted to maintain complete trust in my mentor housemate and friend
I told myself that my seeing abilities must not be too advanced

Atmananda then changed the subject The Golden Gwid Card
he said with a grin gives The Gwid and Roshi Megabucks unlimited
access to multidimensional transreality banking networks

Perhaps it was with The Golden Gwid Card in mind that Atmananda
asked me to perform a task of power He instructed me to inspire
each of the several dozen disciples in the Centre to donate money
Tell them that the money will be used to buy me a surprise gift
and tell them the gift will be a new car He suggested that I remind
them that he worked night and day for the good of others that he
was broke because he gave all his money to the Centre and that if he
concentrated on making money rather than on helping Gurus mission
he could easily afford to buy his own car

Got it I said

Dont pressure anyone If someone does not want to contribute
thats fine

Of course

And keep a list of who gave what

No problemmo Honored that Atmananda would trust me with
such responsibility with such a secret and with so much money
I felt guilty for not having thought of the idea myself
I understood that Atmananda was being a sneak But he did work
for the good of others night and day And ours was the fastest
growing Chinmoy Centre in the world And the Gurus mission would
suffer if Atmananda worked a traditional job Besides I was drawn
to the idea of sneaking for a noble cause

The disciples gave generously and Atmananda soon shifted the garage
door opener from Rachels car which he had frequently borrowed
to the glove compartment of his shiny new Renault LeCar

Rachel who had donated generously to the surprise gift
felt that they should share the garage door opener She decided
that Atmananda was being unfair and told him so

The next day Atmananda instructed Dana to tell Rachel that
spiritually speaking she was heading for some serious hot water
and had better apologize quickly

Unaware of the Garage Door Opener Incident I was feeling pretty good
I felt even better when Atmananda who liked the new car
reminded the Centre of how advanced a soul I really was
When the disciples began to treat me with a mellow kind of reverence
a phenomenon local perhaps to southern CaliforniaI was thrilled
I had an intuitive grasp on how to wield the ad hoc power
but I did not grasp that it was the power which was actually
wielding me

Meanwhile Atmananda had added money collector to the growing list
of my responsibilities This task he cautioned was not without
its dangers Money is physically dirty he said as though
telling me a secret It also retains and transmits the greed
of its handlers Always wash your hands after you touch it
But he did not always ask me to collect it directly

In 1981 he asked me to inspire Richard a tall
largehearted disciple who owned a raquetstringing shop in
La Jolla Richard who appeared to love Guru even more than he
loved tennis was on the verge of purchasing a milliondollar
house which he planned to rent to the Centre at a bargain rate

Hows your game coming along I asked him

Oh not too bad I suppose

Are you ready to play against Guru

Guru is not going to want to play tennis with me

Sure he is Only if I were you Id let him win every so often

We laughed

Hows the deal going I asked

His gaiety suddenly vanished It almost went through he said
But someone pulled out at the last minuteagain

Oh well I tried Maybe theres someone else who could help

No response

Wouldnt it be great I continued to have the Centre across
the street from UCSD Parking sure wouldnt be a problem anymore
And picture a meditation room overlooking the oceana meditation room
large enough to hold everyone

He nodded

Imagine Guru coming to San Diego and visiting us at the new Centre

That would be nice he admitted

Remember Richard I added working in a quote from Atmananda
whatever you really want you will get

Youre right he said resolutely Ill just keep trying

After several more setbacks the deal went through and Atmananda
Dana Anne Tammy and I moved in Atmananda occasionally paced
the carpets of the new Centre improvising a song from Fiddler On The
Roof in which pious dairyman Tevya aspires for a little wealth from God

If I were a realized soul Atmananda began Ahhh yaahtuh
daahtuh daahtuh yaahtuh daahtuh daahtuh daahtuh duhm
All day long Id bittih bittih buhm If I were a realized soul
Ahhh wouldnt have to work hard

Once at the new Centre Atmananda recited for me the money mantra

Ya devi sarva bhutesu ratna rupena sangsthita nastasvai namastvai
namastvai namo nama he chanted soulfully

If I could have followed his words down the corridors of time
I would have seen him

I spent many happy hours with Atmananda in the plushly carpeted
meditation room watching the Pacific Ocean as I listened to him sing
and talk about his dreams Deeply believing that millions would be
made happy I refused to acknowledge that millions would soon be made
And though I never chanted the money mantra I helped my housemate
who did




8 Fast Leader


In the fall of 1980 Atmananda spoke with the Stony Brook disciples
who were still in New York on an inner level He also spoke
with them on the phone He told them that Chinmoy was directing
a special force toward our new milliondollar Centre in La Jolla
He told them about our now legendary recruitment drive He told them
about our feasts

These disciples missed Atmananda They missed his advice friendship
and love They missed his extended family They missed him coaxing
Eat eat

When Sal moved west he joined the disciples who ate each week at
a Mexican restaurant with Atmananda One time Atmananda declared
I wonder where The Gwid has been hiding these days

Sal said You would not believe how many people have asked me
that very question

You swine cried Atmananda All along youve been hiding him
inyour nose

How can you tell

Hahso you doubt my ability to see

A few minutes later the waiter arrived I ordered a quesadilla
and a chile relleno

Cmon kid said Atmananda wheres your capacity

I admitted I was low on money

Stop worrying about money he admonished If youre
in the right consciousness believe me the money will come

Okay I agreed adding a large cheese crisp to the order
So the disciples now reunited with Sal happily broke bread and chips
with our nurturing spiritual shepherd A ditty from the Paul Winter
song Icarus played in the background

Atmananda often spoke about myths Icarus according to Greek mythology
took flight from prison on wings of wax which were crafted by Daedalus
his father Despite warnings from Daedalus Icarus soared too near
the sun and fell with melted wings to his death in the sea

I knew about the myth of Icarus from my childhood Icarus was punished
my father had taught me because humans are not supposed to fly
among the gods

Atmananda did not teach the myth of Icarus He spoke instead
about the role of the SelfSacrificing Hero Be like a star
he said at Centre meetings citing Guru Gandhi and Jesus Christ
Burn your own substance so that others may see

Yet as the months in southern California slipped by he spoke
increasingly about the myth of the Fluid Warrior Be fluid
he said Dont let people pin you down as being a certain way
Perhaps then the deviation from his role as Feeder Of The Tribe
should have come as no surprise It was during a Centre meeting
that he announced the fast Missing meals for thirteen days
he explained would raise the level of our consciousness increase our
personal power and bring us closer to Guru Besides he said
its the thaaang

I longed to raise my consciousness increase my power and develop
a deeper connection with Chinmoy I wanted to maintain my status
as an advanced follower I hungered too for Atmanandas approval
About twenty of us agreed to limit our nourishment to a glass or two
of juice a day

Painful dizzying hours of drinking water passed Several devotees
including Atmananda claimed that their meditations were growing
increasingly powerful In contrast my efforts to empty my mind
were interrupted by gurgling complaints rumbling up from the caverns
of my gut I found myself concentrating not on eternal salvation
but on persistent growls I found myself thinking not about God
but about vast quantities of food

On the sixth day of the fast I stood at the edge of the meditation
room trying not to think about the sharp pains now forking my belly
I gazed at the largerthanlife Transcendental on the tall wooden table
Atmananda typically lectured from beside this shrine It was also from
here that he continued his effort to spread Spiritual Lightto play guru
during public and private meditations After weekly Centre meetings
Atmananda often cooked for the nearly one hundred Chinmoy disciples
It was a joy to watch him sing and dance around the kitchen
adding spice to our lives and to the simmering vats of Indian curry
On occasion he asked Cheryl to cook for the Centre He loved the way
her eggplant parmigiano patties tasted Leftovers were wrapped
in aluminum foil and stored in the freezer

On the seventh day I opened the door to the freezer and there
wrapped in aluminum foil were eggplant parmigiano patties waiting
to be plucked like gems from a cave I felt weak and disoriented
I was so hungry Memories of the peppery patties brought back
the luscious aroma I thrust my hand toward a shimmering
treasure

On the eighth day I wondered if I should confess that I had cheated
I recalled the story of a priest who out of concern for his congregation
hid his doubts about God I too chose not to confess
and the ensuing guilt served to strengthen my resolve not to stray
from Atmanandas suggested path again And though I did eat part
of a patty I still shared with the disciples an overpowering
emptiness and a heightened receptivity to the fast leader

During the second week my meditations began to improve
Typically when I gazed at the Transcendental I only saw a subtle
glow around the photo Now I saw thousands of swirling dots
swimming before me Typically when I meditated on my heart chakra
I had to remind myself to visualize the ocean Now I became immersed
in a world of blue light Typically when I realized that I was having
a powerful mystical experience I found it difficult to reenter
a state of meditation after a selfcongratulatory interruption
Now I found it easy to resubmerge my awareness into a thoughtless calm

My newfound calm however was broken by what Atmananda said
at a Centre meeting several days later He announced that he had
recently attained levels of consciousness so powerful and sublime
that he was no longer the person that we thought him to be
Each time he dipped into these higher realms of perception his old
self died and a new one emerged forged in the fires of what he
called perfection

A number of you have already sensed the change he said
I first started entering into these higher stateswhich I call
basement samadhiduring deep meditation Recently though
I have been slipping in and out of them spontaneously
while walking at the beach for instance or while eating at Howard
Johnsons Now I am finding that I can enter them at will
Atmananda repeatedly described his newfound abilities until
the disciples a number of whom had not eaten in nearly two weeks
appeared to accept the restructuring

After the meeting I sat on the toilet contemplating what had passed
through Atmanandas lips What is going on I wondered
Who does he think he is I felt angry and confused I had been
taught that samadhi was a state of consciousness so exalted that
precious few enlightened souls achieved it But now I was dizzy
and nauseous from hunger I was having difficulty concentrating
I saw swirling dots before me whether I was meditating or not I found
myself realizing that Atmananda had studied meditation in past lives
I found myself realizing that he was an advanced disciple of the Guru
I found myself feeling bad that I had doubted so advanced a soul
so educated a man and so close a friend

The thing to remember I told myself recalling Atmanandas
lessons on humility is that its only basement samadhi

After the fast Atmananda took me to an Orange Julius shop in a mall
We sat by a window sipping the sweet rich drinks

What do you see he asked

I looked and saw our reflection superimposed on the image of the crowd

The people I said They dont seem real

Yes he agreed Theirs is a world of illusion




9 Off The Map


Something heavy has been going down in the inner worlds
Atmananda announced at a Centre meeting in late December 1980
Can anyone see what it is

Is Guru coming to visit us soon asked one disciple

No

Is the earths psychic energy field getting progressively worse
tried another

Yes but thats not it Anyone else

This is going to sound crazy said Kara a UCSD student who seemed
entranced by her own melodious voice But has Guru fallen

Yes

No one stirred

Why dont you elaborate Kara said Atmananda

I first felt it a few weeks ago she said glancing at the ceiling
as if she were trying to recall something I was meditating on
the Transcendental but didnt see much light ya know and well
I just thought it was me but it just kept happening and like I
love Guru and all but Months later Kara would be hospitalized
for a mental disorder

You have truly seen praised Atmananda

My heart pounded I felt like a bomb had exploded in my face
I saw Kara gazing at Atmananda It was only months before that
Atmananda had asked me to deceive the disciples into buying him
a surprise giftthe new car I scanned the crowded room
People seemed disoriented Three disciples visiting from the Santa
Barbara Chinmoy Centre kept glancing at the door They looked ready
to bolt

Many of you have been having difficulty meditating recently
said Atmananda in his familiar soothing voice You have been
blaming yourselves But you should understand that it is not you

For years I have meditated on the Transcendental and the room has
filled with a beautiful white light But lately the light has simply
not been there At first I thought that the level of my meditation
had dropped Intuitively though I knew that that was not the case

I could not believe what was happening I had never heard Atmananda
criticize hisourbeloved Guru Still I had to admit that his
intuition was usually correct

When I tried meditating without the Transcendental he continued
my consciousness suddenly jumped to a much higher level
as if the Guru had been holding me down And yet my logical
mind still refused to accept that the Guru had fallen You see
you dont just turn your back on someone you have devoted eleven
years of your life to someone you have loved more than anyone else
in the universe

I wondered if a con artist would devote eleven years of his life
to a guru

I had to make sure that the Negative Forces were not playing tricks
on my mind he continued So I decided to visit New York and meditate
on the Guru in person I found that he still looked like Guru
But inwardly I could see right away that he had lost his power

I wondered if I could have detected a change

When the Guru began to meditate it became clear that he was not
entering into samadhithough the disciples still believed that he was
Nonetheless I wanted to be absolutely certain that the Negative
Forces were not clouding my vision So I visited Apeksha a Queens
New York disciple who has studied with the Guru for as long as I have

At first Apeksha thought I was crazy But after we spent
hours looking at old Guru photos neither of us had any doubt
as to what had happened

Apeksha is now in a real bind On the one hand he can see
that the Guru has fallen On the other hand he knows that hes
not strong enough yet to ward off the Negative Forces on his own

Richard who had bought the milliondollar Centre raised his hand
and said Atmananda isnt there anything we can do to help Guru

Your sentiment is a noble one Atmananda replied But you have
to be careful If you are swimming near a sinking ocean liner
it doesnt matter how nice a person you areyoull be sucked under
when the ship goes down

You should understand that I am not criticizing the Guru
Nor should any of you You should give him a great deal of credit
for holding out against the Forces for as long as he did

The Forces are not exactly evil per se They are merely playing
their role in the Cosmic Game It just so happens that their role
is to destroy Light

Several disciples shook their heads incredulously Others cast
a glassyeyed soporific gaze at the renegade Centre leader
as if this were a typical latenight meeting

In 1985 the situation in the universe will begin to get much worse
A great cloud of darkness will envelop the earth for thousands
of years

I pictured the shadow of a huge oil slick creeping toward the globe

There will soon be a sharp increase in the number of wars and
natural disasters and nearly everyone on the planet will be affected
Spiritual seekers will suffer the most because they are the ones
who are most sensitive to the pain and suffering of others
It will become increasingly difficult to meditate and seekers
not grounded in the dharma Truth will be in grave danger of being
seduced by the Dark Side

Unaware of the effect Atmananda was having beneath the surface world
of my reason I watched his demanding doughy face and listened
to his soothing arresting voice

But there is no reason for you to indulge in sadness
In times of great darkness spiritual warriors band together
and fight the Forces This is their souls work and therefore
their inner beings are extremely happy Despite enormous odds
they fight for Truth and Light and well Im not supposed to tell
you this but lets just say that the warriors are in for some
pleasant surprises in this and in future lives

I assumed he meant that they would accrue good karma

And I would be willing to wager he said smiling warmly
that they are in for a heck of a good time

Until the warriors are close to attaining enlightenment they will need
a genuine spiritual teacher They will need a teacher who turns out strong
freethinking individuals not spacedout dependent disciples
They will need a teacher who is fully or partially enlightened
and who has extensive experience in guiding souls to selfrealization
They will also need a teacher who has the power to ward off hordes
of Negative Forces

Atmananda reminded us that the powers from his past lives had been
cycling through him and had been propelling him into basement
samadhi and beyond He said that he had been carefully monitoring
his progress toward selfrealization He had not only asked
the Infinite for advice he assured us but had been reading
detailed accounts of the enlightenment process

No one asked to review his source material

He went on to describe the countless inner realms he had been
slipping in and out of lately The realms he explained were so
deep and powerful that the man we had come to know as Atmananda
had all but disappeared inside the clear light of the void

I was attempting to make sense of his claims when he said that samadhi
was incomprehensible to the human mind Then he paused slowly scanned
the audience and announced that he would be helping advanced
sincere seekers in their quest for enlightenmenton his own

Hes on a power trip I thought Maybe hes been planning this
all along Maybe he actually believes in it In either case

You need to realize that I am doing this because it is what
the Infinite wants me to do It certainly wasnt my idea
You see when you reach this stage in the enlightenment process
you completely surrender your will to the Infinite

If thats true I thought no problem But

Please understand that I am not a guru I am a teacher
How can you tell if someone is your teacher By how you feel
when you meditate with them By their glow By how they treat
the people around them By whether they practice what they preach
But you have to be careful out there You have to ask yourself
Are they phony or are they genuine Are they trying to take your money
Are they trying to sell you spiritual rhetoric laced with subtle
complex halftruths

I agree I thought we should watch out But

You have to ask yourself Does the teacher give individual
counseling when necessary Provide a community of advanced seekers
Transmit light inwardly Teach several spiritual philosophies
and disciplines Point out traps along the Path Ward off
the Negative Forces Atmananda inundated us with so many details
that he appeared to be conducting a lesson not a coup

Another way to tell if someone is your teacher Atmananda said
turning toward me is to see if you have studied with them
in a previous life Several of you have been with me before
Mark for instance has studied with me in Tibet Japan and India
He doesnt remember very well but he will You may have noticed
how easy it is to see his aura

Hes just saying that I thought Yet I had always felt
a powerful affinity toward those countries Several students cast
their gaze at me I felt a rush I felt powerful It felt good

Minutes later Atmananda suddenly grew bitter Dont think
that I dont know what some of you are thinking he accused
as he aimed his eaglelike glare You realize of course
who I am he added haughtily

Who are you really Atmananda I wondered I felt frenzied and dazed
as if a dark and powerful cyclone had swept Atmanandas train off
its tracksand me with it I thought about the time Atmananda had
narrated at a Centre meeting the tale of The Emperors New Clothes
He had likened himself to the storys truthful outspoken child

Is he like the child I now wondered Or is he really like
the deceitful tailor Looking up I chose to see him as my kind
warmhearted friend

There are a few of you he said who are letting the Forces
fill you with confusion and doubt But overall you are a fairly
advanced group and should have no trouble perceiving what your
inner beings already know

He sounds like he believes in what hes saying I thought

Look you can think about it all you want But until you learn
to see believe me you wont get very far

The Santa Barbara disciples suddenly stood up

You folks are invited to stick around Atmananda said

They stepped outside and closed the door

At around 930 pm Atmananda announced that those who sought
to continue their studies with him should return to the Centre later
that night Then pointing out that we were letting ourselves
get fogged he suggested that we meditate to clear things up

Many in the audience closed their eyes to meditate

Open your eyes and look at me Atmananda scolded

Despite my new credentials as an old mystical seer I looked but could
not see if Atmananda was an enlightened spiritual teacher who had
found the way or a charismatic megalomaniac who had lost it
But the thick fog of illusion which prevented me from gaining
insight into his true nature might have partially cleared had I
known what Atmananda told Tom only weeks before during a meditation
with Chinmoy in New York

Have you noticed anything different about Guru Atmananda had
asked him

No replied Tom who had not yet joined Atmanandas west
coast entourage

Something heavy has been going down in the inner worlds
Atmananda said Call me in San Diego in late December and I
will fill you in




10 Bicycle RideUtica


One week into the crosscountry bicycle trek I stopped near the New
YorkMassachusetts border by a sign pointing to a campground
It was getting late I wondered if I should save the money and sleep
in the woods I recalled Atmanandas penchant for lodging at exclusive
expensive hotels I realized that I did not want to follow him
I also realized that I did not want to not follow him
I wanted to do what was right for me I followed the sign

I stood at the campground entrance beneath a totem pole whose carved
faces reminded me of the Negative Forces But I was no longer
bound by Atmanandas interpretation of the world I told myself
Sweet dreams I said to the faces and rolled past them

The next morning I crossed over the Hudson River into Albany
and walked up the hill toward the Governor Nelson A Rockefeller
Empire State Plaza Endowed with intricately sculptured arches
and columns the majestic New York State capitol building contrasted
with the modern structures across the street which included
four towers labeled in letters of gold I sat by a reflecting
pool where I watched wavering images of pennies at the bottom
I thought about my financial situation I was doing okay
In Boston I had stopped paying Atmanandas everincreasing tuition
moved from a studio apartment to a small room in a house
and commuted to my computer job each day by bicycle I had managed
to pay off one student loan and after selling the car to build
a small buffer Why I now wondered as I tossed a penny in the pool
did I feel so bad

Because it was Atmananda I suddenly realized who had sent me
to computer school It was Atmananda who had bought me that car
I felt bad because I still considered myself to be in his debt
I needed to distinguish I told myself between the effects of his
unsolicited gifts and the results of my own hardearned efforts

Two days later as I continued to travel the cars whizzing by served
as a constant crushing reminder that towing a threefoot wide trailer
down a country road at night was probably not such a good idea
But driven by the thought of staying with a friend in Utica
I continued despite the danger The road gradually rose into thick
dark woods and there were no houses in sight To complicate matters
I was a devout believer in the excitement and mystery of a journey and
carried no maps I was completely lost

The road began following a winding river and it became increasingly
difficult to convince myself that a town or phone was just ahead
Exhausted I stopped at the edge of a clearing and set up the bent
manysided tentanother gift from Atmananda I lay on my sleeping
bag and listened to the river and to voices from the past
I could almost hear Atmananda talking back in 1979 about the pending
move from New York to southern California

Its very important that the right people go he had said to Rachel
and me

We nodded

Im not sure about Dana and Connie he confided But Im
sure I made the right decision about you two Then he squinted
and focused his gaze above our heads

You realize of course who I am he added haughtily

I was eighteen at the time and thought I already knew who he was
a devoted Chinmoy disciple a respected English professor and a kind
sensitive person His remark had left me so confused and repulsed
that I let it drop from my conscious mind

Now as I listened to the gurgling river I realized that Atmananda
had made the same remark two years later when he announced that Chinmoy
had fallen I realized too that there were other foreshadowings
of his rise to power There were the money and the surprise gift
schemes There was the basement samadhi announcement which came
during a debilitating thirteenday fast And there were numerous times
he manipulated Chinmoys disciples through the use of images such as
when he told me to picture my parents as two red lobsters sporting bow ties

Why I wondered had I largely ignored these and other warnings
Part of the answer I supposed had to do with the masterful
way in which Atmananda used words Equipped with a seductively
compelling voice he built vast virtual kingdoms which were
subject to constantly changing contradictory etiquette
One week for instance it was spiritually correct to save money
for ourselves to have sex with someone outside the Centre
to study with Chinmoy the following week it was not It had been
difficult to maintain a perspective I sensed that another part
of the answer had to do with me and my need to believe but now
as memories and realizations grew too painful to touch I let my
thoughts swirl slowly downstream with the gurgles of the river
Soon I was asleep

That night I woke to the noise of a racing engine and screeching brakes

This is no dream I thought This is real

Two blinding lights sped straight toward me

HEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYY I screamed Suddenly the screeching and
skidding stopped My heart pounded No more than ten feet away
was a vehicle It kicked into reverse spun around and disappeared
into the night in a cacophonous squeal of metal rubber and asphalt
It was some time before the sound of rushing water lulled me back
to sleep

The next morning I woke to the sound of car doors slamming
From the tent I saw a family walking toward the river They stepped
past long skid marks Excuse me I called out which way is it
to Utica




11 Displaced


Arent enlightened souls supposed to be more quiet I thought
recalling Atmanandas newfound access to a world without words
It was an hour or so after the coup His voice crept through my
bedroom door interrupting my thoughts I had been deliberating
on whether I would attend the followup meeting which was scheduled
to begin within minutes Well I thought trying to ignore
the relentless monologue he did claim only partial enlightenment

I read from the Castaneda poster on the wall of my room a quote about
following a path with heart Does Atmanandas path have heart
I wondered Is it even a path What the hell is going on

I turned toward the underexposed photo of Chinmoy still on my shrine
What if Guru has not fallen I wondered not wanting to be left
bobbing in the stormy sea of ignorance

But then again I thought reminded of Atmanandas uncanny ability
to see what if he has I felt overwhelmed I realized I needed
time to think I realized I needed guidance

I wanted to ask former Chinmoy disciples for advice but did not
want to subject them to spiritual doubts about Guru or Atmananda
I wanted to ask friends and teachers outside the group but did
not want to rely on people whom I supposed could not see
I even thought of asking my parents but did not want to rely on two
lobsters sporting bow ties So I tried to assess the situation on
my own

I recalled some of the good times I had had with Atmananda
I also recalled Atmananda admitting to me months before that he
wanted some day to be a guru

I saw him as a genuine seeker on the path to Truth I also saw
him as a man whose ambitions I could not fathom

I need to get away I told myself I need to get a perspective
Its not that I dont trust Atmananda Its just that

KNOCKKNOCK

I jumped up

Atmananda smiled as he opened my door Hi kid The meeting
will start in a few minutes Do you want to greet people
or should I find someone else

Simultaneously soothed and disoriented by his voice and face I felt
reluctant to give up a position of authority Ill greet them
I said

Some of the fifty or so former Chinmoy disciples that I greeted
seemed excited but most like me seemed anxious and confused
Twenty minutes after the meeting was scheduled to begin
I closed the door and sat with the group before a barren
Transcendentalless shrine A nervous tension permeated the room
Atmananda strode in sat down and fiddled with his wristwatch
Then he looked up and quickly raised his hand to his mouth
as if he were surprised that he was not alone A few people laughed

There are four paths leading to enlightenment Atmananda said
Bhakti yoga the way of love is by far the easiest path because love
is the strongest force in the universe

He had described the four paths many times before and I began
to feel slightly more at ease It was particularly reassuring
in his tumultuous world that love was still so important a quality

Karma yoga the path of selfless service is perhaps the noblest
of the paths if you can avoid feeling superior to those whom you serve
Mahatma Gandhi was a karma yogi though he never actually
attained enlightenment

How can he be so sure I wondered Maybe Gandhi had
attained enlightenment I also wondered if Atmananda would
end up serving himself rather than the Infinite

Jnana yoga the path of knowledge and wisdom is the least
traveled of the four paths Jnana yogis face the difficult task
of learning to discriminate between what is real and what is maya
or illusion

It was extremely difficult for me to face my friend and hero
and to discern whether his was a genuine path to the Infinite
or an illusory path to himself So I thought instead about jnana
yoga master Sri Yukteswar whose disciple Paramahansa Yogananda
wrote the popular Autobiography of a Yogi

Mysticism Atmananda said is the path described in the Castaneda books
By living impeccably the mystic accumulates personal power until she
or he is capable of entering into the Other Worlds Though mysticism
is the fastest way to enlightenment it is also the most dangerous
Mystics are often attacked and drained of their power by the
Dark Magicians and many end up becoming Dark Magicians themselves

Though enthralled by this path I was bothered by Atmanandas
insistence that a myriad of beings human and otherwise stood poised
to destroy mystics who strayed from a constantly changing set of rules
that Atmananda happened to know all about I was also bothered
by Atmanandas seeming obsession with Dark Magicians

In past lives Atmananda continued I have followed mastered
and taught each of the four paths You should understand
that if you choose to continue your spiritual education with me
it will be your resistance to the Lightnot my level of evolution
that is responsible for impeding your progress

Where does he come off sounding so sure of himself I wondered
my doubts suddenly resurfacing I really need time to think
about this

For me leading people to enlightenment is old hat Each of you
have been singled out to me through omens or through dreams
It was up to me to hook you to essentially trick you into
pursuing the long arduous path to knowledge Hooking takes
place on an inner level and can not be explained with words
Tricking is necessary because people left to their own devices
are inherently lazy and would avoid their higher destiny

Remembering how Don Juan hooked Castaneda I figured that being
hooked and tricked into a higher destiny was probably okay
as long as everything turned out all right It was deeply ingrained
in me to believe that things tended to turn out all right

It is essential that you learn spiritual etiquette Atmananda said
Do not hang pictures of me Do not worship me Do not treat me
like a guru I am a teacher a spiritual benefactor You will have
to fight your impulses to treat me as though I were more important
than anyone else

I liked his term spiritual benefactor It seemed to encompass
the spiritual worlds of the Guru and the mystical worlds of benefactor
Don Juan I also liked his claim that he sought no special attention

Needless to say you are free to leave at any time
he suddenly lashed out No one is asking you to staybelieve me
you are not doing anyone any favors

It made me upset and confused when Atmananda flipped to his emerging
hostile personality

But if it is the highest good that you seek he said
returning to a gentler tongue you have come to the right place

I suppressed a yawn He had been speaking awhile and it was well
past midnight Exhausted too from the shock of Atmanandas sudden
grab for power I became mesmerized by the sound and the rhythm
of the words

You are caught up in trying to be someone you are not and it is clearly
not working You are fighting yourselves for no apparent reason
Look its easy You can stay the way you are and continue living
someone elses dream or you can come with me on a walk to nowhere
Leave aside your petty jealousies your hates your desires
your attachments your fears and enter the worlds where I hang out
worlds of pure joy light and bliss

Several minutes later Atmananda announced it was time to meditate
I wanted to rub my eyes yawn and stretch out on the soft blue rug
Instead I sat there spellbound drifting in and out of a dreamless sleep
At one point I woke and heard When you attain enlightenment
your selves dissolve in the clear light of the void Maybe you exist
maybe you dont It no longer matters Then as Atmananda rehashed
the details of his own enlightenment I dozed off again

After the meeting I went to my room I need time to think
I reminded myself As I drifted off to sleep I could still hear my
housemate talking

Of the original one hundred San Diego Chinmoy disciples roughly ten
formed their own Chinmoy Centre forty set out on their own
and fifty followed Atmananda While some aspects of Atmanandas
program remained the same others intensified He repeatedly warned
for instance that the Negative Forces would prey on those who did
not meditate regularly those who diluted their power with doubts
about him and those who did not regularly attend his meetings
He began holding crucial meetings each night to help us combat
the Forces The meetings began at around seventhirty pm
and lasted at times until dawn

I attended each of Atmanandas meetings and with only two or three
hours of sleep per night quickly grew fatigued Once my boss
at the UCSD Computer Center found me asleep with my upper body
resting on a noisy threeandahalffoothigh mainframe printer
Another time Atmananda read to me a letter that he had sent to Chinmoy
As you know I have been entering into highly advanced states of
consciousness lately Unable to concentrate I suppressed a yawn
and lapsed into a long thoughtless pause

I was occasionally buoyed by the realization that I desperately
needed rest that I needed time to think and that I needed to take
a break from Atmanandas allnight meetings But I was mostly
slapped by waves of fear of Atmanandas Negative Forces and pulled
under by the weight of shifting etiquette metarational rhetoric
and sleep deprivation

Roughly two weeks into the postcoup program Atmananda began
to publish WOOF The Weekly Newsletter of Anahata Having named
his organization after the anahata chakrathe psychic energy center
of lovehe initially distributed WOOF to the fifty Anahatans
Weeks later after having renamed his organization Church of Atlantis
COA Atmananda decided to distribute WOOF The Voice of Southern
California to tens of thousands of San Diegans

WOOF provided work for Atmanandas devotees and helped bind
the fledgling group We illustrated laid out distributed
and laughed over each edition We laughed for instance
at Atmanandas fabricated advertisement about an imaginary bank
Issue 3 January 1981 Interloka Bank is pleased to announce
the opening of a new branch in Marks room We will be giving
away the first 500 customers as valuable giftsWe at Interloka
are dedicated to serving you totally and are proud to take you
for all we can whenever we can We are the only authorized
distributors of the GOLDEN GWIDcardInterloka BankWe Own You
Perhaps it was the lack of sleep the desire to believe in our
friend and mentor or the need for comic relief that blinded
us to the grim foreshadowing of Atmanandas humor

I laughed the hardest at Atmanandas ads and columns in which he
satirized televangelists Indian gurus the Moonies and New Age healers
see Appendix A I felt justified in laughing at other spiritual groups
partly because they seemed to merit it and partly because Atmananda
said that they needed to be laughed at He wrote in an editorial
Issue 6 March 1981 WOOF the allnatural and organic paper
that millions use to line their bird cages makes fun of it all
We act as a consumers representative for you in the field of New
Age consciousness We feel that if what people have to offer
is genuine then they wont mind us poking a little fun at them
And if they do mindthen maybe the products or services they offer
deserve careful scrutiny and we should reevaluate the truthfulness of
their claims

In my naive sleepless stupor I accepted Atmanandas mission
of poking fun at others and did my best to train and coordinate
the WOOF distribution teams

Perhaps it was to dispel doubts about his own authenticity that
Atmananda proceeded to poke fun at himself Appearing beside
his photograph was the following ad Issue 6 March 1981 His
High Holiness SWAMI UGULA UGLE From The Himalayan Institute For
The Strange will be appearing in Del Mar on March 37th at 2 am
for the high himalayan karrmuppet hat dancing  tea ceremony
 Bring Lots Of Money  His high Holiness Swami Ugula Ugle is
a direct lineal descendant of Llama Fred He personally assisted
in the baking of several LARGE rye breads at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram
A devotee of Sri Ramana Maharshi and baseball the Swami actually
is a good guy He doesnt claim to be any better than the rest
of us But hes happy So maybe happiness can be learned
Come and find outWe may hit you for a few bucks  but well give
you a good timeLots of pomp and ceremony for you Western types
who cant accept that enlightened souls can look and act like normal
human beings

I liked the ad I saw no reason why enlightened souls should not
look and act like normal human beings I liked the way Atmananda
poked fun at the pomp and ceremony which had distanced Chinmoy
from many of his disciples I also found Atmanandas deflated
view of himself a relief

A number of Atmanandas advertisements however were of a more
serious nature In the first issue for instance January 1981
he wrote 1st WORKSHOP OF 1981another exciting Castaneda
experience at UCSDinspired posterersheres your chance
In later issues he repeatedly ran The Experience of Luminosity ad
Issue 6 March 1981 DR FREDERICK LENZ is a spiritual Benefactor
Each monthhe offers several free workshops to members of the San
Diego community At these workshops he provides solid information
and techniques that will help you to gain inner peace and happiness
Dr Lenz does this by discussing the most helpful aspects
of Buddhism Yoga Vedanta Zen Taoism and the psychic and spiritual
artsDuring meditation Dr Lenz enters into Samadhi and directly
channels Peace Light Power and Ecstasy to youADMISSION FREE

At the top of this fullpage ad appeared the words Paid advertisement
as if WOOF had been published by someone other than Dr Frederick Lenz

Atmananda who at times seemed as cautious as he was bold told me
to instruct WOOF distribution volunteers to be highly inaccessible
I kept this in mind one Saturday afternoon as I approached a health
food store with Marty a shy softspoken UCSD student with a sense
of wonder in his eyes Marty had been a disciple of Chinmoy for about
a year

Raising the WOOFs to the counter I said Could we leave
these by the door Theyre free

Sure the manager replied and he took one

I placed my stack and Marty who had been lugging additional copies
placed his as well We were almost out the door when the man said
Say who puts out thisWOOF

I was about to reply that we did not know that we were only
doing this for money when Marty suddenly blurted What WOOF
And in a flash we were gone

When I told Atmananda this story he seemed pleased with me
He was pleased with the large turnouts at his public lectures
and he said I was doing an impeccable job overseeing the ten
or so WOOF and poster distribution volunteers Perhaps it was in
anticipation of unbridled expansion that using doubtdiffusing humor
he wrote and published the Cult Of The Gwid Spreads Throughout
Rancho Bernardo article Issue 6 March 1981 In a seemingly
unstoppable tide of fanatic cultism proponents adherents and admirers
of the Gwid have firmly rooted themselves in Rancho Bernardo and
are expanding at an alarming rate The concerned people of Rancho
Bernardo are helpless in the face of such determined behavior
and many have resigned themselves to their fate and joined ranks
with the lively followers of the Gwidthe Gwid reassured and won
the hearts of the entire Rancho Bernardo community when he gave
a public speech yesterday outlining his major beliefs and ideals
Excerpts follow I do not wish to own your sons and daughters
merely to use them as a tax break It is not the acquiring of
wealth that interests me but rather the actual possession of it
All else is useless to me unless it involves adventure limber bodies
cunning and chocolateIn closing I stand for freedom a cheese
in every hand the dignity to live a free and happy life under my
close supervision

As the month wore on Atmananda often stopped by my room to perform
what he called reality checks This involved chatting and
meditating with me until my consciousness was in a good place
He was probably concerned that as a member of his inner circle
I might unduly influence his disciples But I was too tired
too fearful of the Negative Forces and too busy coordinating WOOF
and poster distribution teams to seriously reflect on or pose a threat
to his selfanointed position of power

Occasionally though I did think about the change But instead
of confronting guilt from having abandoned Chinmoy and instead
of confronting doubts about Atmananda I found it easier to laugh
and laugh at spiritual groups and the absurd things that they did




12 Thwarted Escape


Months after the coup Atmananda held latenight meetings less often
and I soon caught up on sleep Refreshed from the rest I tried
to understand the changes that had been taking place within the Centre
and within Atmananda My thoughts were frequently interrupted
by squawks from Atmanandas fourteen blueandgold macaws
He kept them in a room in the garage He was unaware that they
were gnawing a hole in the roof He planned to tame them and to sell
them at a profit

One time I lay in bed thinking about One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest
a book Atmananda had recommended to me At first I thought
about the similarities between Atmananda and R P McMurphy
the novels freespirited protagonist Both men I realized
exuded auras of selfconfidence Atmananda for instance
had once offered to teach me the secret of attracting women
Jutting his chin forward like a boxers glove he focused on
an imaginary horizon and began taking long and rhythmic strides
He suddenly seemed eight feet tall and I watched in awe as he ignored
the young women who were checking him out

Both Atmananda and McMurphy I realized shared their knowledge
with others Atmananda for instance made a special effort to make
his followers feel big How can you become strong and selfconfident
he asked at Centre meetings By doing all the things I have
been recommending By meditating By leading impeccable lives
By cutting off thosesuch as your familywho are draining your power
And by learning to trust in yourselves

Both Atmananda and McMurphy I also realized were teachers of
selfsacrifice Atmananda for instance lectured on Jesus Christ
Gandhi and McMurphy McMurphy he said at Centre meetings
leads twelve men to the sea and takes them fishing
After the fishing trip McMurphy is worn out He is in pain
He has exhausted his energy so that others might be free
This is the essence of selfgiving This is why I do what I do

I reflected on the sacrifices that Atmananda had been making lately
His efforts at running a spiritual Centre appeared to leave him
exhausted and in pain Dealing with the physical and nonphysical
demands of a congregation was no doubt an enormous imposition
And what a spiritual leader he was I pictured him striding about
with his chin jutting forward exuding that aura of confidence
sharing insights into metaphysical philosophies of the ancients
as well as American pop culture of the early 80s joking and singing
inspiring and enlivening us writing and publishing WOOF as well
as a book called The Bridge is Flowing But the River Is Not
challenging our intellects with the known and unknowable
recording and selling tapes on a variety of spiritual topics
framing and reframing the ways in which we viewed the world
issuing a recommended book list which included The Way Of Life
According To Lao Tzu The BhagavadGita How To Know God I Ching
The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna Tales Of Power Tibetan Book Of The Dead
and Walden distributing geometric patterns on which to meditate
and generating mystical experienceswith Light from the Infinite
of course

But then I thought about how unlike McMurphy Atmananda increasingly
blamed others for the role he chose to play I incarnated
into this world of pain and suffering Atmananda often claimed
to help my students from past lives Many of you dont seem
to realize it but I am in a constant state of pain as a result
of the bad energy that you continuously bombard me with
I am also constantly ill as a result of the massive amounts of bad
karma that I absorb from you on a regular basis

I began to think not about McMurphy and Atmanandas similarities
but about their differences I recalled Atmananda saying When you
attain my level of enlightenment you transcend good and evil
Good and evil become mere words mere concepts in a universe
where only experience matters So why be attached to the good side of
the force

I wanted to believe that Atmananda meant Why worry about being
good if you become goodness itself But other memories surfaced
and I became overwhelmed by a nauseating sense that he had something
else in mind Do you know who I really am he had increasingly
croaked in a low throaty rasp his bright eyes mocking me
The antiChrist I work for the other side Sixsixsix Think
about it

He was only joking I reassured myself Or maybe he was testing me
Thats ithe was only testing me Yet it was difficult to discount
the numerous bonechilling times that he had adopted a credible
Lucifer persona

Vivid memories now rushed forward like water through a newly
unblocked dam There were memories of Atmananda telling students
that he meditated each day at noon Maybe Atmanandas inner being
is always in a state of meditation I thought recalling the numerous
times that I had seen him at noon not meditating But then again
maybe he was just lying

There were memories of Atmanandas recent nightmare Guru tried
to kill me last night he had told me several mornings before

Really I replied certain that Chinmoy the peaceandtennisloving
Guru would not want to hurt anyone

Thats right he continued The Guru attacked me in the dream
plane and nearly strangled me Fortunately I am stronger than he is
otherwise I would now be dead

Are you okay

My neck and throat hurt

But Atmanandas sore throat had not stopped him from voicing
and capitalizing on what he had dreamt

The Guru is attempting to destroy me Atmananda announced to his
disciples at subsequent Centre meetings You need to understand
that while the Guru has lost his spiritual powers he has not lost his
mystical powers Until you break all mental emotional and psychic
attachments to him and until you develop a powerful inner connection
with me you will be completely vulnerable to his next round of
inner attacks Many of you think that this is some kind of game
Just dont come running to me when you find that all your power is gone

Memories about Atmananda that had been suppressed for months
continued to freely flow Do you see how my skin glows
he had recently asked me

That means you are healthy I had replied

True but if you look closely you will see that the light from
my body is emanating from a higher plane

There were memories of eating breakfast with Atmananda and my
other housemates At one point during the meal Atmananda gazed
out the window and spoke as though in a trance The powers
he said repeatedly are coming back to me I can now fill
an entire room with golden light I am not who you think I am
About fifteen minutes later he stopped talking and went to his room

Is there something wrong with Atmananda Anne asked me as we
washed the breakfast dishes

Something is definitely not right I replied We glanced
at each other but found it difficult to share our ideas
and doubts in much depth We both felt indebted to Atmananda
He had managed to convince us separately that had we not met him
we would now be dead He used this tactic on many disciples
He had also been giving Anne and me special attention lately and we
therefore felt particularly guilty that we had doubts about him
Then there was the climate of distrust that he had been fostering
within the Centre He occasionally warned me for instance
that Anne was in a low state of consciousness and that I should avoid
her whenever possible he would then tell her the same about me
and so on Furthermore Atmananda had worked to make communication among
disciples intimidating and taboo

If any of you break the Seven Seals of Silence he had repeatedly
warned inner circle devotees without explaining what the Seals were
I would not want to be in your shoes You have to understand
that there would be absolutely nothing I could do to help you
It would be awfulI dont even want to think about it

Other surfacing memories of Atmananda revolted me I recalled
his oftenstated maxim that only through revenge could one of
lifes greatest joys be attained In WOOF Issue 3 January
1981 he wrote Thousands died today in Pompeii when Mount
Vesuvius erupted without warningIt was seen that the people
of Pompeii had all been enemies of the Gwid in a recent incarnation
and that the explosionwas the Gwids special way of showing
the populace that he is not a person to be trifled with

I recalled with disgust Atmanandas claim that he used to toss
his dog fifteen to twenty feet into the air

I recalled with disgust his treatment of me during one of his
public lectures Can anyone see what is wrong with Mark
he had asked the audience after calling me to the front of the room

No response

Look at him now

Silence

The energy around his head he told them matteroffactly is
not balanced But dont worry We are working on him

As I grappled with the memory I grew angry Atmananda I realized
probably saw me as one of his pets Suddenly it struck me that while
Atmananda might be like McMurphy he might also be like the novels
meanspirited antagonist Nurse Ratched also known as Big Nurse

Both Atmananda and Big Nurse I realized discouraged their wards
from exploring the outdoors I remembered Atmananda warning me
before I went backpacking in Yosemite that he was picking up bad vibes
from the trip Despite his grim prophecy the trip had been a success
I had gone with three friends from the Centre each of whom loved
the woods as much as I did We woke to the sounds of a brown
bear eating our food We played hackysack on top of Half Dome
We got muddy and jumped in a river and yelled and laughed from the cold
Yet when we returned Atmananda scolded me for having picked up
significant quantities of Negative Psychic Energy Dont worry
he told me Ill process the bad energy for youthough it will
probably make me ill Then adding humiliation to guilt he dubbed us
assholes of the mountains

Both Atmananda and Big Nurse I also realized relied heavily on
informants to gather data about the group that they controlled
Atmananda exposed his Big Nurse nature in other ways He claimed
for instance that he had to press all the right buttons
to help people overcome their resistance to the Light and to him
And he said he never trusted a man unless he had his pecker in
his pocket

As I lay in bed remembering and reflecting I felt overwhelmed by
the extent to which Atmananda had changed For a moment I felt sad
I still thought of him as a friend I found myself thinking about
the time he had initiated the former Chinmoy disciples When it came
my turn he placed his hand on my forehead and looked into my eyes
Not a grin or gesture broke his stern countenance Seconds later
he was done meditating on me and I returned to the audience
Then he called me back

You are rejecting me inwardly he accused and tried again
After the third time he frowned

Next he said

Now I struggled with the memory and with the realization that Atmananda
considered me less his friend than a subject I had believed in him
I had loved him I was devastated But as I concentrated again
on his other side the sadness disappeared Atmananda I realized
had been using me I grew angry and scared

My thoughts drifted and I found myself thinking about a bicycle
trip I had taken to Palomar Mountain months before At the top
of the mountain one of my brakes had malfunctioned so I hitched
a ride to a bike shop in Escondido A plumber had picked me up
During the ride the plumber who lived with his wife and kids on
the mountain had pointed out a redtailed hawk Now in my room
in Atmanandas Centre I pictured the way that the hawk had soared
through the clear blue mountain sky on a course of its own

What the hell am I doing here I suddenly thought lifting myself
out of bed I stepped into the hall

What if Atmananda sees me I thought nervously But the door
to his room was shut I stepped into the kitchen Except for
an occasional squawk from a macaw the house was dead quiet
I picked up the phone I remembered the name of the plumber
on Palomar Mountain I called information My heart raced
The plumber remembered who I was

Do you need an apprentice I asked in a strained whisper

Well come to think of it he said I could use some help
But werent you going to finish college

I think I need to take a break for awhile I admitted

I understand Ill tell you what Why dont you come on out
and well talk it over

I wrote down directions thanked him and returned to my room
I wanted to say goodbye to my friends in the Centre but I knew
that in the interest of saving me they would tell Atmananda
And I knew too well that he had a knack for persuading borderline
disciples not to leave So wishing the disciples well on
their journey I kept my plan secret I wished Atmananda well on
his journey too Each time I thought of him though I broke out
in a cold sweat

My plan was to hitchhike that night to Palomar Mountain
I stuffed some gear in my backpack which I kept hidden in the closet
I was ready The sun was starting to set Its okay man I thought
hugging myself I was frightened

Suddenly the bell rang I remained in my room Atmananda answered
the door It was Sal

I heard Atmananda shout Salitos take out the hot sauce

Yowwwww I heard them yell moments later

I opened the door to my room and saw them hopping around the kitchen
For a moment I felt nostalgic Drinking hot sauce and hopping around
with Atmananda had been one of my favorite experiences in the Centre
Returning to my room I quietly closed the door and tried to ignore them
I imagined that I was living on Palomar Mountain by a clearing
in the forest I imagined the brilliant California sun as it pierced
the thick morning fog below I imagined the solitary redtailed hawk
as it soared through the clear blue mountain sky on a course of
its

The door flew open and in strode Atmananda He took giant steps
He was followed by Sal

Heyyy Sal Atmananda blasted Da baby hesa thinkina leavin

Baby queried Sal you thinkina leavin

Gespacho cried Atmananda not waiting for my reply where havea
you been

Witha Guacamole shouted Sal

I was stunned Howhow did they find out I thought

They danced about the room singing about Guacamole a young maiden
who blushed bright green

I did not know whether to laugh or to cry I was doing a little
of both when a minute or so later Atmananda asked Sal to wait outside

Youve got to admit kid Atmananda said to me We have a good
time here

I glanced in the direction of my backpack

Atmananda made a fist and shut his eyes

Watch out cried my rational side But he seemed sincere
and vulnerable and I found myself gazing at him

Contemplate mountainsnot him I thought But in him I saw
a man who could see who read peoples inner thoughts and feelings
who predicted the future who glowed after I stared at him intensely
for several minutes who spent hundreds of hours teaching me about
worlds of enchantment excitement and nobility and who banked on
a career of making millions happy

Sure hes got a lot to offer I thought but hes got that other side
I need to get away But in him I saw the community I had helped build
a community which included all my current friends

Help build another community Find new friends But in him I
saw my aspiration to be a seeker of Truthas well as my desire
to wield power over others

Hes playing a power gamerun

Atmananda opened his eyes He seemed displeased and hurt
He appeared as both a mother and father figure He towered over me
He exuded selfconfidence

I grimaced Over the past few years I had occassionally
questioned Chinmoys authenticity in the back of my mind
Over the past few months I had occasionally questioned Atmanandas
authenticity in the back of my sleepy mind Over the past few days
I had continuously questioned Atmanandas authenticity in the forefront
of my rested mind But now the conflict which pitted my rational
nature against my mystical nature became too much to endure

He opened his fist and demanded What do you see

I saw memories of him telling me to act like a warrior before
the Forces destroyed what we had worked so hard to achieve
I saw him telling me with a concerned look on his face that he had
spent more time with me than with any other student

I

I had developed over the years a deep trust in him as if he were family
I had allowed him to access and to control an important part of me
my imagination and now I feared that without him the window
to worlds of dreams and fantasy would never open up again
There were other fears of death of God of the absence of God
of being lost without a world without a friend

I

I could not admit that I had trod what had in part become a bogus path
I wanted so much for there to be a simple solution

II see sparks flying from your hand Atmananda I said
allowing myself to imagineand therefore to seethe sparks

Atmananda left the room I lay in bed listening to the macaws

I wont let the Negative Forces take me over I determined I am
going to be a true spiritual warrior When thoughts about Atmanandas
other side resurfaced I refused to confront them Instead I silently
repeated Atmanandas recommended doubtcombating mantra NO

NO I thought after reading in a Castaneda book Don Juans
assertion that under no circumstance should you stay on a given
path if your feelings tell you to leave

NO I thought whenever I found myself questioning the process
by which I censored my own thoughts

I was still thinking NO on the day Atmananda noticed the hole
in the roof

GRAAAAAUUUUHHHHG squawked one of the colorful captive birds

BAM BAM BAM echoed Atmanandas hammer as he blocked off
the escape route with some twobyfours




13 Breakdown


In the months after I tried to run away Atmananda kept me busy expanding
his postering routes north to Los Angeles and to the Bay area
Once he had me plan and coordinate a campaign in which one hundred
disciples distributed four thousand posters and one hundred thousand
promotional newsletters across the entire state of California
He did not seem concerned that I was only twentyone He seemed
to have faith in me But after the work was complete his faith
regressed into stinging verbal attacks on my level of consciousness
loyalty and sanity

You are mentally ill he said You can hardly deal with the real world
He explained that I was a prime target for the mindravaging
Forces because I was spiritually advanced because I held a key
position in his Lightspreading organization and most importantly
because I still doubted him

But stick with it kid he added We havent given up on you yet

Atmananda failed to appreciate that my doubtblocking efforts were
largely successful except for the time that I spent with him
It was then that I saw him not as a divine incarnation with a bright
golden aura but rather as an opportunistic PhD with smooth
social skills It was then that knots of tension mounted in my stomach
pangs of guilt haunted my conscience and only after several
emotionally exhausting hours of telling myself NO the surfacing
conflict appeared to shortcircuit It was then that my mind drew
a blank

One evening in a movie theatre with Atmananda and the inner circle
the conflict had already run its course I felt detached numb dumb
I gazed listlessly at the screen Atmananda said something
Sal Anne Rachel and Dana laughed I looked straight ahead
I did not smile

They kept giving me popcorn and candy but I had deeply withdrawn
I did not eat I passed the items along I wished that it
would stop

What happened next seemed to occur in slow motion Sal held
out a bucket of popcorn Halfheartedly I reached for it
I wanted to be left alone I held the bucket loosely
It slipped from my hand Popcorn covered the floor I stood up
Popcorn fell from my lap I sensed that my friends had been having fun
and that I was ruining it for them I would not meet their gazes
I stood there bathed by the flickering lights of the film
frightened by the resurfacing conflict

Maybe its been me all along I thought

Thats nonsense I countered Its Atmananda who is

NO

I grimaced I walked up the incline toward the exit
I left the theatre in a stupor I felt dizzy and disoriented
My mind again drew a blank

I crossed the street to UCSD I walked to Revelle College
To the Humanities Library Building To HL 1402 I often
reserved this room through the Meditation Club for Atmanandas
public and private meetings I sat down I did not reflect
on how his talks in this room had changed in the past two years
Nor did I reflect on how he had changed Nor on how I had changed
I just sat there After a few minutes I stood up and left

I walked to John Muir College I saw a picture of conservationist
writer and mountaineer John Muir I found myself thinking
about the plumber about Palomar Mountain about the solitary hawk

NO I said aloud and turned away

I walked down the hill to Central Library I remembered walking here
with two friends from high school who months before had unexpectedly
appeared at the Centre door I had not spoken with them in years
I told them I was no longer a disciple of an Indian guru
I also told them my new spiritual teacher was different than the others
Hes got a PhD I explained Hes been on Phil Donahue
Hes my friend Despite my assertions that I was fine and that I could
take care of myself they still looked at me as if I were in some kind
of cult

The past is dust I now thought recalling a saying that Atmananda
had borrowed from Chinmoy

I walked to Third College To Third College Lecture Hall
To TLH 104 I saw Atmanandas face on either side of the front wall
I had placed the two posters Atmananda often claimed that his
photograph was a doorway to his awareness field and now I
wondered if he was watching me through the posters on the wall
I felt uneasy and left

I walked to a nearby computer terminal room I logged on and played
Star Trek The E on the screen was the Enterprise Rs were Romulans
Ks were Klingons Klingons had stealth devices I was E Rs and Ks
surrounded E E got destroyed Each time I played E got destroyed
I logged off and walked away

I plodded over soft squishy lawns The sprinklers were on
I got wet I felt like a zombie I felt small

I crisscrossed campus several times more I was tired I thought about
sleeping in the computer room I was afraid to return to the Centre
I was afraid of facing Atmananda I did not examine the fear
I walked home

I opened the door It was late Atmananda stood in the living room
I sensed that he had been waiting for me

You may not realize it he said right away but you are very sick
You are mentally ill I am a professional and you are going to have
to trust me

Atmananda spoke authoritatively He held something in his hand
He said that he was going to help me

Have you ever heard of Stelazine he asked

No

Stelazine is a drug that helps people who suffer from mental illness
or depression With the advent of drugs such as this people who
would otherwise be dysfunctional can lead happy and normal lives

I had a flash of fear I glanced at the door

Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of Atmananda said
holding out the pills Youd be surprised how many people
experience some form of neurosis or psychosis I have a cousin
who took antipsychotic drugs for years Now he flies F14s
for the military

The conflict sparked and it flickered and then disappeared
My mind became still I reached for the pills

Western doctors dont really understand mental illness It is
a form of possession Stelazine blocks out the lower occult worlds
which are inhabited by the Negative Forces

I nodded My doubts remained submerged

We are not about to desert you But you have to understand that you
are mentally ill All along you thought that this was some kind
of game You did not take my warnings about the Forces seriously
You opened up your consciousness to them and now you are paying
the price

I nodded again

Of course there is still hope But youve got to stop fighting me
Youve got to act now He instructed me to take the drug
I had no premonition as I swallowed the Stelazine that Atmananda would
later call me his chemical experiment

In the days that followed Atmananda seemed to enjoy his assumed
role as psychiatrist and nurse He knocked on my door several times
a day and in a cheery voice announced Hi kidreality check
How do you feel

Dizzy I replied I smiled I was enjoying Atmanandas attention
and kind treatment I feel pretty relaxed

Good he said Now tell me about your thoughts

I did

He seemed pleased that I was finding it difficult to concentrate
that my thoughts had a fuzzy dreamlike quality to them and that my
selfanalyzing authorityquestioning nature had submerged beyond
my control

You should feel good about yourself he said pleasantly
You are making some definite progress




14 Bicycle RideSt Ignes


Two weeks into the crosscountry bicycle trek I pedaled from Utica
New York to Rochester where I stayed with Noah a childhood friend
When I told him the story of my years with Atmananda he congratulated
me for having left what sounded to him like an abusive marriage
In fact he was surprised that Atmananda did not have sexual relations
with the men disciples as a way to control them He also pointed
out that while in medical school he had observed selfproclaimed
incarnations of Jesus Christ at psychiatric wards

How can you be sure that someone isnt enlightened I asked
puzzled by the certainty with which Noah expressed his opinions

How can you be sure that someone is he replied

I thought about the visit as I continued the journey west to Detroit
Noahs reluctance to give a person or an idea the benefit of the doubt
and the scrutiny with which he questioned words such as enlightenment
seemed bizarre but not entirely unnatural like a trusted habit
long forgotten

Several days later I rushed down a long hill in northern
Michigan toward an oncoming truck It was twilight
The trailer suddenly hit a bump swung out from behind the bicycle
and slammed into my rear wheel I nearly fell from the impact
Then I lurched forward as the trailer disengaged

Nuna I cried glancing back but the wheel had stopped
spinning and it took my full attention to balance the skidding
swerving bicycle Moments later the truck smacked me with a wall
of air as it thundered by and the bike quickly came to a halt
I ran up the hill to the wayward trailer and found Nunatak peering
out from the doggiecarrier She tilted her head as if to ask
Is this something all huskies go through

I sat with the pup in the tall grass I was devastated The rig was
the vehicle I had chosen to exercise and exorcise my body and mind
It was also my means of transportation Now it was broken
As the sky went from deep purple to black the memory of Atmananda
calling me his chemical experiment seemed to usher in the darkness
Other recollections bubbled up from the murky depths only to burst
into vivid unnerving images Here was Atmananda telling me
that he was a professional that I was extremely sick and that he
was going to help me Here he was telling me to swallow my pride
And here he was telling me to swallow the Stelazine

Cars zoomed by now and then dispelling apparitions of my former mentor
Headlights flashed an angry light at the severed trailer
the pretzelshaped wheel and the fallen gear strewn in disarray
Then the lights were gone leaving behind a fierycomet afterimage

I wondered why Atmananda had fed me the drug Did he actually
believe that he was helping me If so why didnt he recommend
that I seek guidance outside his direct sphere of influence
It seemed more likely that unable to tell the difference
between helping and controlling people he gave me the drug to
strengthen his grip on my mind But I suspected another motive
I knew that Atmananda had often used me as a sounding board for new
ideas and later for LSD He may have wanted to observe my reaction
to the Stelazine before using it on othersor on himself

As I meditated on Atmanandas possible motives I swatted mosquitos
and picked at scabs of aging stings I did not yet know that he
had given Stelazine to at least one other inner circle follower

I tried to remember how I had felt during the Stelazine experiment
I recalled feeling dizzy I also recalled feeling at peace with myself
The conflict between my rational and mystical natures did not seem
to matter Nothing seemed to matter

Youre doing fine kid Atmananda had told me each day
Just go with the flow and enjoy the process

Stunned by the memory I held the husky in my arms
Nunatak was a wonderful traveling companion Each day she tugged
and leaped alongside the rig as if she were a fullgrown sled dog
She licked the drying sweat and tears on my face

I tried to understand why I had followed AtmanandaDr Lenzs
drug prescription Perhaps the most compelling reason was because I
was afraid not to Since the coup Atmananda had stepped up his
effort to instill fear in his followers He taught me for instance
to fear the Negative Forces which he said were destroying
the fabric of society Just read the papers he would say
Youll see what Im talking about

He taught me to fear what would happen if I left the Centre
You know too much to leave Its a greedy materialistic world
out there Your soul would be miserable Besides the Forces would
flatten you like a bug You would lose thousands of lifetimes
of evolution

He taught me to fear not just the Forces but people particularly old
friends and family Its best if you dont tell them what we do here
Believe me they wont understand Theyll end up blocking your
progress and sapping your power

And he taught me to fear for my sanity You can no longer deal with
the real world Youre lucky I dont drop you off at a mental institution

Other reasons why I had felt compelled to take the Stelazine slowly dawned
I realized that Atmanandas senatorial countenance his smooth
commanding voice and his PhD contributed to an aura of authority
which I had found difficult to dispute He had combined Western
rhetoric Eastern mysticism and American pop culture to entice me
vague language long pauses and repetition to hold me spellbound
and fear fasting and sleep deprivation to break me down

Had Atmanandas techniques ended there I might have seen him
as a control freakand left But each time he had broken me down
he built me up again with kindness and with words of inspiration
He spoke of saints of beauty and of the wisdom of the desert
He spoke of selflessness quixotic quests literature and wonder
And he spoke of an unconditional love and of a multilifetime camaraderie

Had Atmanandas techniques ended there I might have seen him
as a confused combination of Big Nurse and McMurphyand left
But he managed by flipping between abusive and supportive personas
to keep me off balance on an emotionally gutwrenching roller
coaster ride Genuine spiritual benefactors were supposed to keep
students off balance he maintained because it was only then
that they could let go and make real leaps in spiritual progress
It was primarily in his uncanny ability to read an individual or group
and to gauge the precise instance in which to flip that Atmanandas
brilliance could be found I had been unaware that he was speaking
to me controlling me through the rhythmic off and on language of
intermittent reinforcement

It was painful to grapple with memories of Atmananda and to see him
in such a searing light But it was far more painful to examine what it
was about me that had complemented his techniques and allowed me to
accept his authority I thought about how as a thirteenyearold it
had been easier to journey into lives of sorcerers from the Castaneda
books than it was to deal with the emotions of a family in conflict
years later it was easier to follow Atmanandas narcotic
program than it was to brave a suppressed conflict of my own
I also realized that I had grown up feeling blessed immortal
and immune to the dangers of the world later when Atmananda
issued postcoup etiquette and Stelazine I found it difficult
to admit that I was so wrong for so long about so many things
and that I was just another victim of one mans other side

The reluctance to view myself as a victim persisted and now
draped with a sleeping bag to protect me from mosquitos I found it
difficult to admit that the Atmananda phenomenon may have had as much
to do with Atmananda and with me as it did with the balance of society
Years later I wondered if modern American society had been
replacing a system of mythology and religious dogma with a system
of reason as a way to explain ourselves and the world around us
I wondered if there were a genuine need in humans not only to categorize
and comprehend but to acknowledge and to address in unscientific terms
the mystery of that which creates binds animates and destroys
And I wondered if teachers like Atmananda were increasingly exploiting
such a need in millions who for whatever reasons had chosen a path
apart from conventional religion Perhaps by nurturing both mystical
and rational inclinations society could explore the realm beyond
the surface world of reason while keeping pace with the charismatic
predators of the New Age

But in the darkness of a northern Michigan night still angry and
upset from memories of Atmanandas experiments I sensed that a New
Age of enchantment and wisdom had passed me by Yet I also felt
cleansed and refreshed like the air of a city after heavy rain
I stood up and began gathering the fallen gear in a pile by the trailer
Suddenly I was staring into headlights which did not disappear
A man got out of the pickup

What happened son

As I recounted the bicycle incident I tried to control the quiver
in my voice

Officer Brown he said showing me a badge He dropped me
the dog and the rig off at a motel in nearby St Ignes
He also left me his number at the station in case I needed help
getting back on the road

The following afternoon the policeman pounded the wheel back
into shape fixed the derailleur replaced spokes and bolted steel
bars over the aluminum which attached the trailer to the bicycle
When he was done he refused to take my money

What are you doing now I asked

Cleaning the frame

Thanks I said but you dont have to do that

Whenever you do a job son do it right

Later that day invisible currents from California along with
the weight of the baggage continued to affect my progress west
As I rode through the woods of the Upper Peninsula I reflected on Noahs
remark that I had escaped from an abusive relationship My story
I concluded was not so unusual after all Invigorated I coasted
down a long hill and squeezed the brakes intermittently




15 The Enchanted Taco


Late one night Atmananda met three hundred disciples in a parking
lot in the desert ninety miles east of San Diego He led us
for hours over soft cooling sand to a spot in a dry river bed
He had us form a circle around him As we scanned for scorpions
before sitting down the desert floor lit up like a circular
gyrating constellation until one by one the flashlights went out and it
grew difficult again to see

If you enter a higher level of consciousness Atmananda began from
the center of the circle you will see the Warriors on the cliffs across
the gorge They are subtle beings from another plane of existence
They look a lot like American Indians

Hundreds of braves tall and unflinching were conjured in my imagination

What do you see Atmananda asked the group

I made no response I did not doubt the images cast on
the back of my eyes by my brain Nor did I doubt Atmananda
In the months after the weekandahalflong Stelazine experiment
the doubts and the conflict had vanished I was reluctant to speak
because my vision had been so subtle so fleeting

Meanwhile others in the circleengineers teachers
doctors lawyers students and business professionals
also remained as silent as the rocks and hills around us

If you are at all serious about the study of mysticism
chided Atmananda you must learn to talk openly about what you
see If you dont your mind will play tricks on you and you
will doubt your experiences later on

More silence The next ten seconds passed very slowly

Atmananda I suddenly announced I saw the Warriors

Others in the circle soon saw them too

Atmananda held desert trips once or twice a month and by mid1983
followers saw him walking above the ground on a cushion of light
flying to distant mountains sending columns of light into the sky
and causing constellations to gyrate and disappear

On one starlit night Atmananda raised his hands above his head
As he slowly lowered them he made a low whistling sound like
the wind

What did you see he asked afterward

I didnt see anything one new follower bemoaned

Advanced psychic vision is necessary to perceive what I am doing or
more accurately not doing Atmananda said patiently

I hate to sound negative persisted the follower but what exactly
are you doing

For a moment I felt tense The disciple had unearthed a question
that had badly stung me many times before

Sometimes I alter actual physical objects sometimes I alter
your perceptions and sometimes I alter both Atmananda said
dispelling the tension with his gentle soothing voice

Atmananda I saw you become a luminous egg said another follower
borrowing a phrase from the Castaneda books

Anyone else

I saw light from the stars pass through your body tried another

Very good Who saw me disappear

I often saw Atmananda disappear after I stared at him for several
minutes without blinking But during one desert trip in 1983 I saw
him vanish independently of the dilated pupils Then a moment later
I saw him reappear as someone else

What I am about to say he had announced that night is going
to come as a shock to you You see I am not who you think I am

The followers stopped fidgeting

A few days ago he continued when I stopped drinking Tab I knew
something was up This morning when I woke I looked at my body
There was nothing but Light I suddenly understood It was all
so simple

He paused Who am I he asked

Dead silence

Dont all answer at once

Nervous laughter

I thought you were a man named Atmananda who meditated extremely well
said a man

Atmananda did not reply

Are you a doorway to eternity

Pleaseno philosophy tonight he said sharply Who else

After several more tries a devotee suggested that he was Vishnu
a Hindu godhead

Close he approved

I felt a rush in the pit of my stomach Atmanandas private jet
after years of accumulating the fuel of our trust and belief
was finally taking off I was worried Fastening my seat belt
would do me no good if he started thinking he was on par with Jesus
Christ or the Buddha

Are you Rama someone asked

Yes he replied I am Rama the last incarnation of Vishnu
You people think that I am a person but I am not Over the years
I watched my various selves fade away I fought the process tooth
and naillike each of you are doing now But it was in vain
I could not stop the process of dissolution I had to admit that I
was no longer a person This morning I suddenly knew who I was
I have been cyclingI am beginning to rememberEternity
has named me RamaRama most clearly reflects my strand
of luminosityWere at the end of a cycleAt this time
Vishnu takes incarnation as a personVishnu is that aspect of God
that preserves and protects lifeRamathe last incarnation
of Vishnu

Jolted by the speed and the angle at which his jet now climbed
he was putting himself on par with Jesus Christ and the Buddha
I suppressed a reaction and awaited instructions from the pilots
latest persona But the instructions it turned out had been issued
months before Each follower was supposed to write and submit stories
typed doublespacedabout his or her experiences with him
Our prose he had been telling us was indicative of our mediocre level
of consciousness so we wrote and rewrote and we tried to revise
guided by his comments in the margin

Stories about Ramaa figure from Hindu mythologycan be found
in the classic Indian text The Ramayana Stories about Rama
Atmananda Freda guy from Connecticutcan be found in The
Last Incarnation

The words THE LAST INCARNATION flash from the cover in letters of gold
above a backlit photo of Rama the books editor publisher and focus
The stories portray Rama as a warm intelligent servant of Truth
with enough mystical power to light up a city A few of my stories
which also depict him as a downtoearth demigod appear in
the 403page collection But there were other stories I could
have written

I could have written for instance the story of Rama and the Puppets
of Bliss and Profit In 1980 Rama got a cuddly white hand
puppet which had purple feet and a purple toucanshaped beak
Rama called it Bliss and often played with it as though it
were alive He appeared to make it talk yawn sleep and soar
Bliss is soaring through the other worlds he explained In 1982
I asked Rama what he wanted for his birthday

Another Bliss he replied with a boyish grin So I set out on a quest
with Paul to buy a Bliss for our benefactor Together we combed
the toy stores of southern California but the search was to no avail
Weeks later I spoke with a puppet designer in northern California

Sounds to me like you have a Take Me To Your Leader she said
Does it have antennas

No

Then you must have an Uncle Lucius

Actually I said we call it Bliss

Over the next few years Rama ordered thousands of yellow
red green pink and blue Blisses

Oh how adorable said the flight attendants when they saw
the grown man in first class playing with the colorful puppets

We donate them to childrens hospitals Rama claimed
He failed to mention that he brought the Blisses to Centre meetings
where he infused their beaks with a special force and where he sold
them at a handsome profit

I could have written the story of Rama and the Token Underdog
A large part of what motivates me Rama once confided
is my concern for the underdog He displayed his concern one
desert trip by accompanying a handicapped student who was unable
to keep pace with the group I recalled one of Ramas lessons
You can tell a persons level of spiritual evolution by how
they treat those around them I felt proud of my teacher
But shortly thereafter Ramas attitude changed He began
fourwheeling the desert sands while the rest of us walked
He also banned from all desert trips those who were unable to
keep up

I could have written the story of Rama and the Menorah Incident
I once placed in the window of my room a menorah a traditional
candle holder used by Jews during the celebration of Hanukkah
But when my housemate and mentor noticed he looked at me askance
What are you crazy he said Take it down right away
It was inconceivable to me that behind a mask of intellectual
and religious tolerance could lie so powerful a bent to control
I removed the menorah from my window

I could have written the story of Rama and the Satanic Billboard
In 1982 and 1983 Rama occasionally said that hed like to place
a billboard of his face above the busy intersection of freeways 10
and 405 in Los Angeles He seemed excited about including this message
666Were Back

And I could have written the story of Rama and the Blade Runner Day
Would you like to meet Harrison Ford Rama asked me over
the phone in 1983 By then many San Diego devotees had moved
to the expanding Centre in LA based largely on Ramas advice
Centre meetings in Los Angeles were first held in a small room
in Hollywood and then in a large room with a stage in Manhattan Beach
By the time meetings were held in the ornate Beverly Theater
on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills Rama commuted each week
from his oceanview Malibu rental to the expanding Centre in
San Francisco

You mean Hans Solo I asked You bet I drove west
then north toward Zuma Beach Twenty minutes later I turned
down a long driveway to Ramas house which he claimed that he
rented from Goldie Hawn Hawn wanted to sell Ford wanted to buy
and Rama Anne and I wanted to see in real life a favorite image
from the magic screen

Rama wore a colorful shirt patterned with scenes of the tropics
similar to one worn by Allie Fox Harrison Ford in The Mosquito Coast
Obsessed with creating a world of his own Fox bares a captive
community to his innovative dreams poisoned experiments
and diminishing sanity

Rama suggested that we act busy so I went outside and pushed a broom
I smelled smoke Nearby brush fires had been fanned out of control
by increasingly strong winds The thick yellow sky reminded me
of Blade Runner a science fiction film starring Harrison Ford
The recollection caused my mind to digress down a corridor of memories
smoke and mirrors

I pictured Rama in line at the movies which is where he
met disciples on Saturday nights He was easy to spot
With arms folded one foot forward and head tilted back
he played the part of the selfpossessed insurgent general who had
ordered his troops to carry on despite the overwhelming odds
His bush of hair made him seem taller than he was

Rama incorporated into his teachings what he gleaned from the three
sometimes four films he saw in a typical week He taught for instance
that he was like Mike Robert De Niro from The Deerhunter Mike risks
a game of Russian roulette in wartorn Saigon to try to save Nicky
Christopher Walken his friend

You are like Nicky Rama told me frequently

Drawing too from Mel Gibsons role in Road Warrior Rama taught
that it was okay for spiritual Warriors to temper their valor
in order to survive

Rama taught that it was spiritually correct to see such movies
as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Dawn Of The Dead and The Shining
each of which he viewed repeatedly Horror films he claimed
were a clean way to alter our level of consciousnessNo drugs no sex
and were a graphic reminder that each lifetime was but a brief
fragile opportunity through which to evolve

Citing Mick Jaggar in the concert film Lets Spend The Night Together
Rama further taught that it was perfectly natural for powerful
men to develop their feminine side Part of the reason why
people are so attracted to Mick he said is because he puts out
a very feminine energy Rama later depicted himself in posters
and newspaper ads as an androgynous figure

Perhaps as part of a doubtdiffusing lesson Rama once invited
about twentyfive inner circle disciples to see Split Image
a movie portraying a cult in the late 70s When the cult leader
Peter Fonda blatantly manipulated his followers Rama laughed out loud
We laughed too It was an odd moment our laughter had a nervous
edge to it I laughed partly to fit in and partly because I sensed
but refused to confront the absurdity of the situation

Another time Rama took followers to see Conan The Barbarian
When Conan Arnold Schwartzeneggar observes a cult leader raise his
arms to silence throngs of DOOMchanting disciples Rama who sat
beside me in the theatre turned to me and said He doesnt have
such a bad set up I figured Rama was only joking I laughed
but laughed alone

Ramas lessons about movies often turned my topsyturvy world
further upside down He told me for instance that Star Wars
creator George Lucas was wrong to have Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill
prematurely leave a mystical apprenticeship wrong to have evil
unmasked by good and wrong to portray Yoda as being gay

Yoda is gay I asked

Yes Rama replied but dont worryyou are not gay No way
Of course youre not gay Dont believe anyone who tells you
that you are Why even allow yourself to think that you are gay
Then after laughing heartily he hissed an imitation of the Emperor
Darth Vaders evil master

Rama who assumed broad powers to interpret reality and myth
seemed to believe that he was made of the stuff of legends
He got touchy however when disciples looked to legends outside
the realm of his control One time for instance I excitedly told him
that I had seen an autographed photo of Mark Hamill

Here you are sitting next to a fully enlightened teacher
he said bitterly and all you can do is live in a world of fantasy

Rama was right I decided as I pushed the broom down the long driveway
in Malibu I was living in a world of fantasy There shaded by billowing
yellow smoke and accompanied by a talkative real estate agent
was Harrison Ford quietly stepping toward Goldie Hawns house
toward the Last Incarnation of Vishnu Ford wore dungarees

Rama introduced himself as the renter and as a teacher of advanced meditation

Anne introduced herself as a friend of Ramas

Sure is a blade runner kind of day I blurted

Ford said hello and went inside with the agent We followed

When the entourage reached the master bedroom Rama gazed
at the ocean and declared The Force is strong here

But Ford did not seem interested in Ramas assessment of the local
mystical energy field Nor did Ford seem interested in Ramas
recollections about his fire fighting days Rama failed to mention
that he had fought the fires while in a prison camp where he
had been serving time for selling drugs Ford was interested
in the construction of the house and now he had seen enough
He started to leave

Rama handed him a Self Discovery the free promotional publication
that had taken the place of WOOF Rama gave him an issue
that had been distributed throughout southern California
On the front cover was a blowup of Cindy a beautiful young
blond woman meditating on the hood of Ramas red Porsche
Inside were stories from The Last Incarnation On the back cover
was Ramas pastlife resume advertisement in which he claimed
15311575 Zen Master Japan 16021771 Head of Zen Order Japan
17251804 Master of Monastery Tibet 18341905 Jnana Yoga Master India
19121945 Tibetan Lama and Head of Monastic Order Tibet 1950 
Self Realized Spiritual Teacher and Director of Spiritual Communities
United States

Ford took the issue and left

Its just like in Star Wars Rama noted as Ford drove away
He doesnt really believe in The Force

There was more to tell of that particular storymy house burned
down that day And while disciples gave generously when Rama took up
a collection no one could have replaced my birthday gift from Rama
I found it lying on the scorched foundation reduced from a sleek
red bicycle to a meteorlike lump of distorted alloys

But of all the sketches I could have written for The Last Incarnation
perhaps the most telling would have been the story of Rama and the
Enlightenment of Women Certainly we welcome men into our organization
Rama often announced But our primary focus is on the enlightenment
of women His interest in helping hundreds even thousands
of women seemed a genuine reflection of his commitment to the underdog

When I first met Rama in 1978 his crusade for women had already begun
Unless you are close to enlightenment he had told potential
women disciples you will lose a great deal of your spiritual
and mystical power through sex and through sexual relationships
Over the years Rama spent many hours counseling and persuading
women seekers to leave their boyfriends and husbands in the name
of gender equality and higher spirituality In 1981 for instance
weeks after the coup he wrote and published in WOOF
Issue 2 January 1981 Dear WOOF I love the spiritual
life and the vital life too What should I do  Sproutarina
J Prana

Dear Sproutarina Your difficulty is that you are burning the candle
at both ends and sooner or later you are going to melt I suggest a day
in the desert alone a good movie or a powerful occult experience
You see Sproutarina God loves you no matter what you do If you
want the vital you can have it and if you want the psychic you can
have that too But you cant have both at least not in our Centre
Decide which will really fulfill you and choose that one Only you
can decide what you want in this lifetime

Ramawho preferred the term having sex to making love
occasionally softened his position on sexuality and invited followers
to relax accept their human nature and do whatever worked for them
Hey Kate he once said in an Italian accent You go out witha
my boy Mark and Ill take plenty good care ayou It was understood
that Rama meant business when he donned his Godfather persona
and I subsequently enjoyed a severalmonth relationship with this
young disciple Yet when I asked Rama if it was possible for a man
and woman to have an emotionally and spiritually supportive relationship
he smiled shook his head and said Even if you find a woman
whose consciousness is spiritually refined it still wouldnt work
because yours is not

In contrast his relationships with women were highly refined
Rama pointed out because for him sex had become an act of spiritual
not physical selfgiving Nonetheless after he got his housemate Anne
pregnant in 1982 his selfgiving nature was nowhere to be found
Instead of offering her wisdom or support he sat in the lobby of
the abortion clinic sorting and counting cash from a workshop he had
given on spiritual evolution

When Anne returned to the lobby after the abortion Rama had disappeared
Embarrassed she approached the receptionist

He went to a bookstore the woman replied He said hed
be back later

Women in the Centre were not supposed to let on that they were
sleeping with Rama Anne therefore felt that she had no one with whom
to share the burden of the abortion When she appeared depressed
a week later Rama in front of another disciple remarked If its
not one its the other

Rama often invited women disciples to talk with him after
Centre meetings Anne recalled years later But there in his bedroom
they frequently exchanged more than words Ramas relationship policy
she also recalled required inner circle women to limit their
relationships to one man himself His justification for the policy
was that it kept them from unwittingly transferring their partners
lower male energy Male energy he frequently complained
very much affected his finely tuned delicate sensibilities

Perhaps Rama sought protection from baby energy as well
he managed to persuade one disciple in her late twenties to leave
her husband and newborn child

Despite his ability to invoke adoration and fidelity Rama seemed
concerned that his power to control female followers was
not absolute He therefore kept certain men from the inner circle
despite my recommendations

Jeff I once advised is really smart Hes good with people
and hes a lot of fun to be around

Rama hesitated I dont know Mark Im worried about Dana

What do you mean

I dont want her falling in love with him

Rama was in a bind On the one hand he knew that Jeff would be an asset
to the operation On the other he sensed that Jeff was too bright
he had been an honors graduate student in chemistry at UCSD
too athletic he played ultimate frisbee and too good looking
to be running around loose within the carefully controlled nest
But Rama had a plan He encouraged Jeff to form a relationship
with Karen who had previously followed Ramas advice and turned
down an offer from Stanford medical school He then encouraged
them both to enroll in a computer science Masters program at UCLA
and to gradually phase me out as the poster and newspaper
distribution coordinator

One night in a restaurant in Los Angeles Ramas story about wanting
to help women took on a new twist He had invited me to dinner
with Nick and Sarah a handsome young couple who acted in Hollywood
and who had recently joined the Centre When the waitress came
to take our orders Rama began waving and curling his hand

Moments later as the waitress was walking away Nick asked
What were you doing with your hand Rama

I was sending her sexual pleasure directly through the inner worlds
he replied glancing at Sarah now and again

Stories of Rama and the Enlightenment of Women were all
the more startling I found when narrated by Rama himself
There was the one for instance about Sue

Sue once came in my room Rama told me took off
all her clothes and flung herself on me Please dont
make me go home and masturbate Rama she kept saying
but I just sat there and meditated on the Infinite until I entered samadhi

There was the one about Harry the main character from Lolita
one of Vladimir Nabokovs novels The point of Lolita
Rama explained to me is not that Harry repeatedly slept
with a fourteenyearold after kidnapping and drugging her
The point is that Harry really did love her

There was the one about the UCLA students Sometimes I walk
the streets of Westwood he said at Centre meetings and drain
the undergraduates of their mystical power Now dont get all upset
Its not like theyre using it Most of them are just wasting it
on sex

And there was the one about his former wife At one point in
the relationship he told me I had to decide whether to be of
service to the one or to the many Rama often described his dream
of living in a fortified desert compound with hundreds of heavily
armed women devotees Perhaps he broke up with his jealous
wifeShe kept imagining that I was looking at other women
in search of the many

Once I invited a friend from work to one of Ramas public lectures
She was interested in meditation and had recently left her boyfriend

Thanks but no thanks she exclaimed when I mentioned the lecturers name

So whats wrong with Rama

You mean the one who lists his past life credentialsdates and all
in fullpage ads The one who specializes in women

Uh yeah

He isnt bringing women to enlightenment Mark Hes bringing
them to bed

Come on I countered trying not to admit to her or to myself
what he had been doing for years So he has a girlfriend
Whats wrong with a spiritual teacher having a girlfriend

Theres nothing wrong with that she said firmly But he
is sleeping with many many women

Where did you hear that

From a number of women I met at a meditation retreat in San Diego
They fell for his line about being lovers in past lives

Suddenly I recalled Rama on stage at Centre meetings wearing short
red gym shorts closing and spreading his legs tonguing in a slow
circular fashion the insides of his mouth The memory repulsed me
But the repulsion I feared was due to the Negative Entities within me
And it was Rama I quickly reminded myself who had been trying day
and night to imbue the many with the fullness of his enlightenment

Well I have been good friends with him since 1978 I replied
and hes just not like that

When disciples Giles and Claire a couple living in Los Angeles
heard similar stories about Ramas sexual exploits they spoke
candidly with one another

We were not judging him Claire recalled years later
But we were concerned about what would happen to him and to our
community if the press found out I wrote him a letter saying
that he looked much more human than divine when he approached women
at Centre meetings for sexual rather than spiritual reasons

And I decided to phone him recalled Giles A member of his
staff said that he was not at home and would call me back
Several days later at three am the phone rang It was Rama
We spoke for about an hour When I suggested that he consider exercising
more discretion he was reasonable and polite We discussed the issue
like human beings After all I am old enough to be his father
He told me Of course I like girls Im just an ordinary guy
You dont know what its like They throw themselves at me Whats a
healthy man to do

At the next Centre meeting Claire said Rama gave us the cold shoulder
And at the one after that he distributed the tape Sophisticated Sexuality
see Appendix C During the break Rama approached me
His eyes became small like hard little bullets He was furious
He told me repeatedly that my letter was selfindulgent nonsense

Then he asked to see me outside said Giles Alone Grabbing me
and digging his fingers into my shoulders he shouted IVE BEATEN YOU
IVE BEATEN YOU ALL

After the break Claire continued Rama lectured for thirty
minutes about how people had been constantly throwing him bad energy
all the while glaring at Giles

During the next few weeks Giles and Claire fearfully recalled
Ramas threat that deserters would look and feel like hell
Nonetheless they stopped attending meetings and trips to the desert
where Rama kept trying to disappear

Some of you still harbor doubts that I can disappear Rama accused
the several hundred disciples who sat around him in a circle
But perhaps if I dissolve someone else you will find it easier to see
Tonight I will be dissolving an old friend of mine Mark would you
come up here please

I walked toward him I was thrilled My heart was pumping fast
I loved being the center of attention

Now close your eyes he said placing his hand on my forehead
He flashed me a devilish grin This wont hurt a bit

I closed my lids After several seconds I felt detached from my
thought process It was as if I could visually observe a thought as
it formed connected with meaning and vanished One thought had been
What is going on As I tried to anticipate my next thought
I ended up instead observing the thought of anticipating a thought
when suddenly a volley of words jarred me out of the trance

Earth to Mark Come in Mark

I opened my eyes and saw Rama towering above me laughing softly
I looked away and saw liquid gold specks lining the blackness
I had managed until now to avoid thoughts about time and had no idea
how long the experience lasted

What did you see Rama asked the group

It looked like Mark was dizzy and you caught him right when he fell

I didnt see anything reported another But I felt very peaceful
I found it easy to slow my thoughts

You dissolved him Rama offered another

As we prepared for the journey back to the cars Rama invited me
to walk with him at the front of the line

That was fun wasnt it he asked several minutes later
As he scanned the path for rattlesnakes his powerful beam cut a sharp
tunnel through the darkness

I agreed It had been a blast Over the past five years
moments of deep meditation had been typically interrupted by thoughts
such as HeyIm meditating But moments earlier I witnessed
thoughts objectively as if they belonged to someone else

Tonight I helped you see a beautiful world Rama said My intent
is to show my students how to fly through these worlds on their
wings of perception It is easy to show you because you like me
Many of my students fear me or hate meor even worse they worship me
Suddenly he flipped off the light and a fifteenfoot high ocotillo
shrub vanished

I dont perform miracles to show off my powers but to expand
your view of reality If my students can accept that I disappear
just imagine what they will be capable of

Though I was learning to fly on my wings of perception
and though in the months after the Stelazine trip I continued
to deeply suppress part of my rational side I never fully accepted
Ramas world in its entirety I never accepted for instance
the story of Rama and the Enchanted Taco The Enchanted Taco
Rama said was an immense luminous and otherworldly treat
It could be seen in the desert hovering casually over mystical
power spots garnished with divine light knowledge and guacamole
But in a parking lot at four am I saw Rama wave to three
hundred blearyeyed disciples get in a black Turbo Carrera
and disappear




16 Ride To Heaven


I didnt do well enough to remember wrote Donald Kohl in 1984
Bye Rama see you next time

Months later Donalds father called me Do you have a few minutes
he asked I knew that Rama would not want me to talk with Mr Kohl
But I was shocked by the image of blood spurting from Donalds wrists

I have time I said Im sorry about your son

Mr Kohl asked about Rama and the organization

I know what youre thinking I said But Donald was not involved
in a cult Were not like that Rama teaches us to accept
or reject his recommendations based on our own perceptions
He teaches us that hes no more important than anyone else
I did not mention that Rama had distributed to each devotee a
largerthanlife poster of his face

Rama asks that we help cover the cost of room rentals and things like that
But were in charge of our own money I did not tell him that Rama
actively sought gift money to supplement the skyrocketing tuition
Nor did I tell him that Rama worshipped and had named the organization
Lakshmi the Hindu goddess of beauty and prosperity

Our goal is to teach people to meditate I did not mention Ramas
stated interest in finding students from his past lives filling stadiums
and starting a world religion Nor did I mention that Rama actively
pursued these interests He payed many thousands of dollars
for instance for promotional photographs featuring a backlit aura
He shifted his advertising copy and name to reflect a growing
sentiment that gurus were out while Zen masters were in he called
himself Zen Master Rama And he persuaded thousands in the two
years since the Stelazine experiment that he was a living legend
a rare presence and a direct line to God

We normally meditate on our own for forty minutes in the morning
fifteen minutes at noon and fifty minutes in the evening
Once a week we meditate with Rama at a Centre meeting
Sometimes well attend a public lecture or a field trip to the desert
Sometimes well help out on a project like office work or postering
But thats pretty much it Basically were just a group of healthy
individuals who happen to meditate Its not like we live in an ashram
or anything I did not mention that Rama had been initiating disciples
with namesPrema Hanuman Arjunataken from Hindu mythology
Nor did I mention that Rama had been teaching us to flip between
various caretaker personalities He taught for instance
that within the hostile environment of the outside world
we should adopt the shrewd powerful personality of a warrior
whereas within the safe environment of a Centre meeting we
should adopt the gentle trusting personality of a child
Nor did I mention the details of Ramas spiritual etiquette some of
which he described in his tape Welcome To Lakshmi see Appendix B

Rama teaches us a combination of spiritual paths like Taoism
mysticism and Christianity I did not describe what might happen
at a typical Centre meeting Rama who usually arrived about forty
minutes late might begin with a discourse on the teachings of Lao Tzu
Castanedas Don Juan or Christ Then couching parables in
modern terms he might proclaim Short is the path of the fast lane
on the freeway to enlightenment Or he might say As the coyote
tries to catch the road runner so too tries the seeker to comprehend
the life of a fully enlightened teacher through rational means

He might make the several hundred disciples laugh with Many are cold
called but few are frozen chosen

He often lectured the men in the Centre that our untamed sexual energy
had been stunting the spiritual growth of our sister disciples
He often lectured the women in the Centre that they needed
to learn how to emotionally detach themselves from men And he
often lectured both sexes that he attracted very powerful souls
that we were way too powerful for our own good and that we
had been making him physically ill by relentlessly attacking him
in the inner world

He lectured too about the inevitable eclipsing of the worlds
spiritual light a process which seemed to be perpetually accelerating
Havent you been feeling it he asked

Yes Rama came the inevitable response I feel it

Rama quoted Chaucer Roethke and Shakespeare He also told a story
from The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury about a Martian who
when approached by humans transformed into the object of
their desires The Martian became a womans dead son for instance
until someone else walked by I am like the Martian said Rama
I am constantly being called upon to fulfill your desires

Rama might question disciples with a portable microphone
a la Phil Donahue Why dont you share what you saw tonight
he said roaming the aisles He seemed to enjoy interrupting us
when our response was spiritually or grammatically incorrect

Then Rama sat in front of the auditorium wiggling his toes
and fielding questions a la Chinmoy

Rama a woman might begin

Yes

The men where I work are constantly sending me sexual energy
Each day I come home completely drained

What do you do for a living

Im a receptionist

Why dont you study programming he suggested Software professionals
tend to be less visible and therefore less prone to psychic attack

Rama often lectured on the nature of consciousness Consciousness like
a complex system of software has thousands of levels of nested
selfaccessing subroutines He taught that the next step along
the path to selfknowledge was to debug those subroutines hidden
in our minds at an early age by our teachers and in particular
by our parents

Rama lectured on the nature of words Words are inaccurate pointers
to reality and should by no means be trusted Logic he said
was based on the shaky foundation of words and was of primary
value to those who could not access Truth directly Since he
had transcended these limited tools attempts to comprehend
his actions on a rational basis were meaningless In fact
those doubting his behavior through a framework of words and logic
were merely reflecting their own mediocre level of awareness
Those who concluded that he was greedy were therefore guilty of
greed themselves

I felt confident as I listened to Ramas words that I was learning new
valuable ways of understanding knowledge Just as often though I felt
confused by the belief that words had no fixed real meaning
It was as if Rama were yanking the rug on which my descriptions
of the world were centered But then I recalled that confusion
was an essential part of the process through which the Infinite
dissolved our countless selves in the clear light of the void
If you think you have it figured Rama often pointed out you have
what we refer to as an inflated ego

At one point during a typical Centre meeting Rama frowned and said
Okay whats up

No response

Hello friends Whats going on out there

The silence and tension grew

Lets talk

It occurred to me that I did not like his tone Suddenly a hidden
mental subroutine activated reminding me that those who questioned
his methods were asked to leave the Centre

Fess up he snapped

Rama started one disciple I dont know what it is but

Of course you know Lookyoure fooling no one but yourselves
Cmon peoplefess up

Rama are we focusing on the lo lower occult again

What do you think

Yes Rama

Look none of you realize what you are getting yourselves into
Once you open the door to the Negative Entities it is nearly
impossible to get rid of them He read our expressions and paused
as if to assess the point at which to start building us up again

Eternity is all around us at every moment he said gently
be absorbed Nirvana is a world of unlimited ecstasy be absorbed
Go see the new Schwartzenegger movie be absorbed You are doing
much better lately be absorbed Dont forget that we will soon
be meditating together on the golden beaches of Maui be absorbed
Be proud that you are taking a stand against the Negative Forces
be absorbed Dont be so hard on yourselvesgive yourselves a break
be absorbed Learn humility and you will learn the secret to happiness
be absorbed A desert trip is coming up soon be absorbed
Forget not that our mission is to spread light in the world
be absorbed Our friends from past lives will soon be joining us
be absorbed

Rama asked that we sit up straight He put on electronic music
slowly scanned the audience and raised his hands above his head
Many of us gazed at him intensely It didnt matter that
those occupying the same room as him were during meditation
supposed to evolve hundreds even thousands of lifetimes
We still tried to absorb as much spiritual light as we could

Then he might end with a quote from the teachings of Lao Tzu
Castanedas Don Juan or Christ

At the next Centre meeting Rama might announce that everything had
changed and that we were in an extremely poor state of consciousness

At the weekly Centre meetings I told Donald Kohls father
Rama teaches us to realize our full potential He teaches us to love
and respect life I did not describe however Ramas fixation
on death

Someone in San Diego is trying to kill me Rama once told devotees
in a turret of the castle he was renting I am moving to Los Angeles
I suggest that you do the same

Another time Rama turned to me and said Do you realize that I
can kill you at any moment

Hes only joking I thought

No really he went on I am extremely strong and could kill
you in an instant

Repeatedly during the 80s and early 90s Rama expressed a desire
to take disciples for a ride in a Lear Jet into a snowcapped mountain
into the other worlds That would be a clean way to go
he said

One time after a beach meditation Rama asked five or six disciples
What do you see

I see red said Sal I see blood destruction war global apocalypse

Very good said Rama

Repeatedly during the 80s and early 90s Rama slept with numerous
women devotees several of whom claim that he took no measures
whatsoever to prevent the potential spread of AIDS

Also in the 80s Rama encouraged followers to secure software contracts
in ADA a computer language used to control the United States
hardware of war

On the night before his thirtyfifth birthday Rama invited thirty
or so disciples to a party He had been either ignoring or abusing
many of us so the invitation came as a welcome surprise Unlike other
recent events there was an upbeat feel to the party He had asked Anne
for instance to spend time decorating the room with colorful balloons
Maybe a few of us thought things are going to get better
During the party though Rama demanded that a handful of us confess
one by one before the other disciples that the demons had succeeded
in talking over our souls

Anne is the worst Rama proclaimed lashing out at her
She either looks like a witch or a whore Then in a seeming
attempt to exorcise the demons he told us to meet him the following
day at the Los Angeles coroners office He wanted us to witness
an autopsy

The next day I watched two men saw the skull of a John Doe
hitandrun victim The saw whined They peeled off the face
The air smelled acrid My stomach felt bloated That could be me
on the table I thought I wanted to retch The pathologist
measured the brain I found myself thinking about life
Not in terms of Ramas increasingly fearful descriptions of the world
but in terms of my gut feelings Something happened I wrote
in a journal that I had recently started I felt it a change
inside me

After the autopsy I noticed the way I breathed I noticed the way
my blood pulsed through me I slept more I had been sleeping only
five or six hours a night I watched the way light played off ripples
in a body of water Rama had failed to appear at the coroners
that day Until the next Centre meeting his world seemed small

Mr Kohl listened to my descriptions of Rama and of the organization
Tell me Mark he said Does Rama pressure the disciples to be a
certain way

Well technically were not really disciples Were students
Think of the organization as being like a university
Sure theres some pressure if thats what you want to call it
But it doesnt come from Rama It comes from each of us wanting
to do well

I did not mention that Rama often threatened to spend less
time with his disciples because we maintained an abysmal level
of consciousness and because we bombarded him with Negative
Occult Energy You should understand that I will still love
you no matter what you do Rama lectured But when you ignore
my suggestions when you succumb to the Forces when you dont keep
up with your tuition payments you are setting yourselves up for a
multilifetime pattern that will be extremely difficult to break
You are also letting down those we were sent here to help
Many of you dont seem to realize that you can easily be replaced
Believe me there are plenty of seekers out there who would genuinely
appreciate the opportunity that the Infinite is providing here

Nor did I mention to Mr Kohl that Rama followed through with his
threats of replacement In 1984 for instance he kicked out four
hundred followers after looking at their photos and reading their
recently submitted essays The purge gave him greater control
over the remaining four or five hundred who now lived in constant
fear of getting kicked out As for the outcasts many had developed
psychological dependencies on Rama They continued to write him letters
to appear regularly at public lectures and to send him money
Because he maintained their names and addresses in a database
he could always swap them back in when the current batch burned out

Nor did I mention that in response to the intensifying pressure
I had dropped out of UCSD a year before Donald a sensitive
bright UCLA undergraduate committed suicide

The longer I spoke with Mr Kohl the more I became aware of
and uneasy aboutthe discrepancy between what I knew and what I
was willing to admit about my teacher and my organization
I felt particularly uneasy knowing that at one Centre meeting
Rama had promised to take closer devotees for a ride through
the death worlds in a Porsche After I hung up the phone
the uneasiness did not disappear Though I did not openly entertain
doubts about Rama my ability to separate myself from his world
and to view myself as an individual was suddenly infused with
new life




17 On High


How would you like to get out of the spiritual rut you are in
Rama asked me in the spring of 1984

I would like that very much I replied I knew that there was
something wrong with my life For years I sought enlightenment
but was no longer happy For years I sought the Spirit but was no
longer animated For years I sought the Self but was no longer me
I was ready to try anything I told him

He offered to give me LSD I suggest that you take it he said
But you should only take it if it feels right

In the past he had used Chinmoys line that hallucinogens damaged
the subtle body But the potential benefits he now explained
outweighed the risk provided that a fully enlightened teacher
was around to supervise Dont worry he added with a smile
I am very familiar with the drug

I was startled by the offer As a teenager I had responded
to similar solicitations with Im high on lifedrugs would
just bring me down But the buzz of youth had long disappeared
and I knew that the rut ran deep Sensing too that three years
before Rama had diffused my internal conflict with Stelazine
I wondered if LSD could quell my recently resurfacing doubts

There were other factors involved Months before Rama had asked Tom
the bassguitarplaying disciple who had finally moved west
to compile a tape of songs from the late 60s I want to tap into
the people who had been involved in the early consciousness movement
Rama explained Subsequently the list of musicians whose
songs Rama played at Centre meetings and at public lectures
without regard for copyright lawgrew from Tangerine Dream
Walter Carlos Jean Michel Jarre Vangelis and the Talking Heads
to now include the Beatles Cat Stevens Traffic and Jimi Hendrix
Perhaps my decision regarding the LSD was affected by the music
Perhaps it was affected by my fascination with the drug scenes in
the Castaneda books Perhaps it was affected by my realization that
according to the dictates of Ramas etiquette there were grave karmic
consequences for those foolish enough to ignore his suggestions
I told him it felt right

Roughly one hundred fifty miles east of the beaches of Los Angeles
in Joshua Tree National Monument was a rock climbing route called
Therapeutic Tyranny Less than ten miles away by the edge
of a mountain the five or six disciples probably did not see Rama
handing me a tiny stamp On it was a picture of Mickey Mouse dressed
as a wizard waving a wand

I was slightly apprehensive LSD was supposed to be a powerful drug

Chew it for a few minutes Rama whispered

It was as bitter as he said it would be I soon noticed the deep
blue sky turn to bands of crimson and yellow and orange I noticed
the lights of Palm Springs twinkle like stars thousands of feet below
I noticed the mammoth peaks of Mount San Jacinto gradually fading away
So stark and surreal was the scene before me that I had to remind
myself that this was how the desert appeared at twilight ordinarily

How do you feel kid

Fine Rama I reported enjoying the attention Nothing yet
About fifteen minutes later he gave me another stamp when I found
myself noticing that I was noticing that I was noticing that I
was

that i was

that

i

hey

  h e y   it

  w o r k s 


I gazed at the lights of Palm Springs I did not blink
I did not breathe I lost awareness that I was on a mountain
I lost awareness that I was tripping I lost awareness that I existed
The points of light grew fuzzy and bright

Time touched the mountain world I blinked I inhaled
I turned from the light I am alive in this desert I thought
Through the powerful rosecolored lens of the initial rush
the thought magnified and blossomed into a stunning realization
I blinked again and exhaled

I turned and saw Rama and the disciples I knew that I was
seeing on a different level than they were This made me happy
A large silly grin took hold of my face The joy gradually receded
but the facial muscles held I knew the grin was out of sync
I laughed

I turned to some rocks I grew serious The rocks I realized
are part of the Earth The Earth is sacred I did not realize
as I continued to astonish myself with my own profundity
that I had finally entered a world similar to the ones described
in the Castaneda books

Suddenly Rama raised his arms and made a whistling sound
The disciples looked at him as if he were a god I felt detached
from the scene as if I were observing myself observe the disciples
observe the man acting like a sorcerer Soon I detected a faint
glow from the corner of my eye I gazed at what I felt was an
incredible source of power beauty and wisdom It was the rocks
They were glowing

On the drive back to Malibu Rama was perhaps experiencing
flashbacks from the late 60s because he let me do my own thing
As a result I rode with him in front but focused on Cindy in back
Her flowing blond hair and radiant face had made an impression
on me long before she appeared on the cover of Ramas newspaper
I turned around often to smile at her

Hey there I said at one point

Cindy looked slightly embarrassed Hey there she returned sheepishly

This is fun I thought For the first time in years things were
looking up




18 Wheres My Tribe


In the fall of 1984 Rama took twentyeight disciples for a ride
around the western United States The purpose of the trip he said
was to see which city we were supposed to move to I was glad
that he had invited me I liked the idea of searching for a home
I loved to travel And I looked forward to an exercise in seeing
This is going to be fun I thought

The trip began in a parking lot in southern Malibu Rama raised
his arms made a whistling sound and said The ocean is your friend
You do not know how long you have left in this world You may never
see the ocean again in this lifetime You should say goodbye

It was a poignant moment for me I loved the ocean
Goodbye I thought Then Rama strode to his Turbo Carerra

It no longer bothered me that Rama owned two Porsches at a time
when many disciples were struggling to meet the increasing tuition
If he got what he wanted I figured maybe hed go easy on us during
the scorching demonandbrimstone monologues Besides at three
am in northern Malibu he once took me over one hundred and
twenty miles an hour The acceleration had been breathtaking
the ride smooth

The disciples now turned from the ocean to their cars
Anne Dana and I walked to our gifts from Ramatwo Mazda
RX7s and a Honda Civic Wagon respectively Then we drove
east by northeast into Los Angeles the high desert and southern Nevada

Rama had divided us into four groups with three cars per group
and two or three disciples per car The groups caravanned separately
and we met two or three times a day typically at a Dennys restaurant
or at a Best Western motel I rode with Alexander a spare
devout UCSD recruit who had impressed the Centre with his ability
to place second or third in a marathon Perhaps from a lack of social
selfesteem Alexander never said much but he spoke with me
and I enjoyed his company

The following day Rama invited me and Alexander to ride in his group
It was at a rest area in southwestern Utah that Rama approached me
and said You had better stop vibing Laura I am fucking her

A UCSD recruit in her early twenties Laura had large dark eyes
and ample social selfesteem She spoke so fast that she often
slurred her words She was currently riding with Rama

Sorry Rama I said startled by his raw honesty

We pushed on to Denver and then to Boulder where we stayed
in a motel near the university We assessed the city in terms
of jobs housing computer courses and mystical power spots
Two or three days later Rama asked us to see if we should stay
or move on to Boston He seemed pleased that we voted to stay
Boulder after all was commuting distance to computer jobs in Denver
it had a respectable university it was beautiful in the winter and cute
the year round it felt at least a mile high until several days later
when Rama accused us of destroying it with our powerful Negative
Energy Field

Pack your things he ordered and we cut a path south toward
Albuquerque along the Rockies edge

There was something about the open road and the blue Colorado
sky that absolved us of our guilt from having decimated a city
because Alexander and I were anything but upset The Beatles
White Album was playing Sexy Sadie a song satirizing an Indian guru
I asked him if I could turn up the volume Sure Soon he asked me
the same Before long the music was blasting and we were singing
Helter Skelter at the top of our lungs WHEN I GET TO THE BOTTOM
I GO BACK TO THE TOP OF THE SLIDE AND I STOP AND I TURN AND I GO
FOR A

Several nights later near Tucson Arizona the disciples looked
out from a hill at the lights of the city below This is a real
moment of power said Rama It is essential that each of you
speak with power and with respect for the spirit of the land

I typically spoke very briefly at such a gathering unless I knew
in advance what Rama wanted to hear But now I went on and on about
how in Tucson there was a healthy balance between people and nature
and about how if we moved here we would heal When I was done
Rama took me aside and said Kidyoure going to be all right
But Tucson was not the right city he later announced so we continued
the drive west

In a motel just east of San Diego Rama left us one evening
to conduct a Centre meeting in Beverly Hills When he returned
he berated us for not working together and for not even trying
to maintain a decent level of consciousness in his absence
You are acting like a hoard of angry sorcerers he snapped
borrowing a phrase from a Castaneda book But he was wrong
Paul Karen and I had stayed up late that night trying to come
up with a catchy name for his proposed software company
Furthermore we had meditated together we had maintained something
of a meditative consciousness and we had tried to see which city
we were supposed to move to

In the past when Rama contradicted the facts I had assumed
that he was right while my seeing was wrong But riding across
Americas west was making me feel big And memories of traveling
rogues from Jack Kerouacs On The Road which I had read and
reread in high school was making me feel good and rebellious
And Tom Wolfes experimentallypunctuated dayglowingly huemorous
satirically lyrical The Electric KoolAid Acid Test
which Rama had recently assigned was making me want to view
the world through the sharp detached eye of the narrator
Maybe Rama really cant see all that well I suddenly thought
Maybe hes making it up as he goes along

The following day Rama asked the group to see if we should
stay in San Diego return to Boulder or move to Boston
When our vote was split mostly between Boulder and Boston he gave
the word to move on So we drove around again to Los Angeles
Nevada Utah and Colorado where by the intersection of Interstate70
and Route 82 he announced that we had arrived at a crossroad
we could continue the search for a home or we could take a side
trip to a posh resort in nearby Aspen

By now the disciples had been out of work for nearly a month
and a few of us were running low on money The majority voted
to continue the search He led us instead to Aspen

I told Rama that I felt uncomfortable having him pay my way

Look he retorted its my experiment

Does that make us your guinea pigs I wondered

Later that week in front of a handful of disciples Rama harshly accused
me of indulging like a child of attacking him in the inner world
and of ruining the experience for the others Then he issued
a compassionate smile Dont take it so personally kid
he said pleasantly Your consciousness got stuck so I fixed it
Then he swaggered away with the confidence of a heavyweight champion

Rather than accepting the abuse as I had done in the past
I found myself thinking about The Electric KoolAid Acid Test
I thought about how main character Ken Kesey convinced himself
during a drug experience that he could access godlike powers
Kesey writes Wolfe was able to step back and realize that he was
only hallucinating Rama who often claimed that he took so much LSD
in the 60s that he never came down also convinced himself that he
could access godlike powers But Rama went further than Kesey
Rama professed to be an actual incarnation of a god Rama professed
that a few dozen disciples were causing extensive invisible damage
to a metropolitan area Maybe Rama has been hallucinating since 1969
I thought Maybe unlike Kesey he cant step back and get
a perspective

During the drive from Aspen to Boulder I also realized that Kesey
never charged tuition never tricked followers into buying lavish
gifts for himself and never claimed to be the antiChrist Kesey drove
around America with his community in an old school bus Rama led us
separately in cars Kesey brought diverse groups of people together
Rama made a special effort to keep friends lovers and families apart
Yet despite their differences I sensed that Rama had been shaped
in his youth by Keseys pioneering experiments with Eastern
culture and Western counterculture consciousness and drugs
expression and art and freedom and control I wondered if Rama
by assigning the book had been trying to reach out vicariously to
his past and to an influential leader of his generation

When we arrived in Boulder Rama seemed to flip between supportive
and abusive personas more rapidly One moment he was calm
and kind the next he was ranting about how the Negative Forces
which had been coinhabiting our bodies were causing his hair
to fall out and affecting the health of Vayu his advancesouled
Scottish terrier then flipping again to the other extreme
he encouraged us to move to a new condominium just outside
of Boulder where we could all live close to one another
No one reminded him that only weeks before we had left the city
in psychic shambles

The dream of living and working togetherof community
lingered on and Rama had us fill out rental applications
When he found out that I had signed up for a less expensive condo unit
he gently chided me You just dont get it Mark Thats your
old self trying to reassert itself You need to have more space
You need to live in a clean healthy environment

I tried to explain to him that I needed money for Centre expenses
and also for food

Dont worry kid he said Ill subsidize you I want you
to be happy

So I switched to the most expensive unit and I was happy
and the other disciples seemed happy and Rama seemed happy
Boulder after all felt at least a mile high until a few days later
when Rama shouted at us for having once again destroyed the dream
the Light and the city

This is crazy I thought After the meeting I went for a walk
I thought about how earlier in the trip Cathy had approached me
and said This may sound funny but is Ramaokay

What do you mean I had replied

Heswellits just that something doesnt feel right

Rama is fine I told her He just sees on a different level
than we do

But now as I strayed from the condo grounds I wondered if Cathy
had been on to something I thought about how the other disciples
had seemed pensive lately as if they too shared her concern
I thought about how during the trip Rama seemed to be flipping out
of control Maybe Rama is not okay I thought

Meanwhile my readings and reflections on Kesey had located Rama
within a cultural context which like the knowledge that the Wizard
of Oz was a man behind a curtain largely deflated his projected
images and metaphors This enabled me to question elements
of his world without fear of reprisal

I questioned the Negative Forces The Forces I realized had never
affected me before I met Rama Furthermore they seemed to disappear
as soon as I stopped thinking about them Maybe the Forces only
exist in my mind I thought Maybe they are a part of Ramas trip
Ramas experiment

I questioned Ramas claim that I was mentally ill and that I could
hardly deal with the real world I recalled my success as an
undergraduate at a competitive university as a computer operator
and programmer and as Ramas distribution coordinator I recalled
his claim that nearly everyone on the planet was mentally ill
Maybe Rama isnt qualified to diagnose mental illness I thought
Maybe playing doctor is his way to control people

At one point during the walk I wondered what the consequences were for
doubting the Last Incarnation of Vishnu But Rama had encouraged us
in the early years to question him and to think for ourselves
Besides I thought I havent burst into flames yet
So I went right on remembering questioning and thinking

I thought about The Razors Edge a movie about one mans attempt
to walk the narrow path between the spiritual and the mundane
What struck me about the film was that the man does not have a guru
Life is his teacher

I recalled the hourlong conversation I had had with Donald
Kohls father and suddenly the dam burst open and a flood of suppressed
memories washed over me I pictured Rama shouting Fess up
announcing his name change telling me to swallow the Stelazine
bursting into my room on the night that I wanted to leave

I walked briskly back to the condo and knocked on Ramas door
Things dont feel right I told him I think I need to take some
time off

You have to do what is right for you he replied

I wanted to make a clean break I still had a few hundred dollars
I told him that I wanted to give him back the car

He frowned Your desire to return the gift he said is proof
that you are mentally ill and that you can not function in the real world

I did not want to stand around and argue Okay Rama
I said and left I felt primed for action I was not scared
I felt sure I was doing the right thing I said goodbye to
the disciples packed and started to back out of the lot when I
saw Laura in the rearview mirror signaling me to wait

Rama wants to see you she exclaimed

My impulse was to press the accelerator After all he might
try and get me to stay as he did years before in La Jolla
But I felt that I had come a long way since 1981 I felt confident
that I could handle myself Besides I was curious I let Laura
lead me to him

Rama Anne and a few others were in the room They looked somber
Rama had us stand in a circle and hold hands He told us we
were a tribe It felt odd holding hands It wasnt the sort
of thing hed normally have us do After a brief meditation
he took me to another room and gave me a long hug I drove away
feeling sad

For the next few days I rode east driven by childhood memories of
New England and by the notion that I had seen Boston as the target city
In Nebraska and Iowa I felt good about my decision to leave
But I had developed no system with which to support my new
interpretation of the world and the decision seemed more distant
with each passing state I had devised no language of rebellion
forged no icons of discontent and on a more practical level
had no sense of what I wanted to do or whom I wanted to be
I had met Rama when I was seventeen Now I was twentyfour I had never
experienced successes or failures from following a path of my own design
I had been deprived of this ritual of passage into adulthood
I had come of age in a destructive cult

The Electric KoolAid Acid Test was packed away somewhere in the back
I arrived in Massachusetts feeling frightened and confused
I felt drawn to southern New Hampshire where eight years before
I had worked one summer on a farm I found Rico a younger
friend from the farm days who was now a senior in high school
I had not seen him in years I wanted to tell him about
Rama and the organization but did not know where to start
There are bad people out there Rico I told him You have
to be careful Whatever happens always follow your heart
I drove away Rico later recalled with a frightened look on
my face

I called my parents in New York and asked them if they wanted
to see me They flew to Boston and we went to a restaurant
near Gloucester Massachusetts I felt happy to see them
but could not share the burden of my new found freedom

Days later I sat in traffic in the suburbs of Boston I felt
completely alone I missed the disciples It was true that we
had fallen for Ramas line about stealing one anothers power
It was true that we had allowed Rama to foster through ongoing
whispering campaigns a climate of fear and competition
But I didnt care The disciples spoke the same language as I They
were my friends

I missed Robert a UCLA graduate who in 1982 was drawn to a lecture
on the works of Carlos Castaneda Months after joining the Los
Angeles Centre he was approached one night in Pacific Palisades
by two white men Robert was black The men were angry that his
girlfriend was white They each pulled out a gun and took aim
They said Get out of the car Robert was concerned that they
would rape and kill his girlfriend He made a quick decision
He slammed down hard on the accelerator When the bullet
entered his head he kept driving He passed familiar streets
He had grown up in Los Angeles Blood streamed down his face
He drove to a hospital where in the weeks that followed he did
miraculously well The experience cemented his devotion to Rama
who took credit for the recovery

I missed the Stony Brook disciples I missed Paul the computer
wizard with the silly grin Sal another computer genius had taken
to heart Ramas caveat that disciples were stealing his power
But beneath his fears was a gentle humorous soul and I missed him
I missed Rachel the doctor who had continued to support the Centre
financially and who had apparently forgotten about the Garage Door
Opener Incident Dana the former model and occupational therapy student
often grew icy with the power that Rama gave her over other disciples
But I knew that as Ramas office manager hers was a particularly
trying position she typically slept three or four hours a night
and I missed her I missed Anne the nurse who had known Rama
the longest and who was also under intense pressure to perform
Once I overheard Rama advising Anne to accept her true cold
and callous nature Despite his remark she mostly lived up
to her spiritual name Prema which symbolized a higher form
of love

I missed the disciples whom Rama had dubbed assholes of the mountains
I missed UCSD recruits Doug and Eric whose adventuresome spirit
and love of the outdoors was evident in their winter assaults on
12000 foot peaks And I missed Mike Tall with thick red hair
Mike looked ate and at times acted like a wild Viking
In reality he was a wild UCSD medical student Once he told
me that he occasionally slept in his Volkswagon bus in campus
parking lots

You really do that I asked

Yeah The cops dont like it though

What do they do

They shake the van and try to get me to come out

Do you

Nah I usually go back to sleep

Perhaps Mikes unique way of doing things as well as the pride
with which he questioned authority contributed to his
standing in the Centre as a lessthanmodel disciple
Im glad that you are friendly with Mike Rama once told me
But you should understand that hes not really into our program
I can see that hes in it for himself

I missed Tom the bassguitarplaying disciple from Stony Brook
whom Rama had put in charge of security Rama based on fears
that his psychic vision excluded those who wanted to shoot him
had assembled a team of volunteer disciples and professional
security guards Tom one of Ramas closest disciples
was the first highprofile follower to leave the Centre
He left largely as a result of the Omelet Incident

The Incident occurred in Ramas kitchen in Malibu Rama sat with Tom
and Fran a tall young UCSD recruit with a long powerful stride
and a glint of the wild in her eye Rama liked to say that Fran had
spent past lives in Africa as a hunter and that she was one of two
disciples with the potential of attaining enlightenment in this life
I was the other At around 230 am Rama asked Fran to cook
him an omelet Perhaps she was tired from having accompanied
Rama and Tom that night to the San Francisco Centre meeting
She burned the eggs

You are in a lousy consciousness Rama accused her stewing over
the omelet Your level of spirituality has been plummeting
Then he continued to lambast her

Tom was struck by the contrast between Ramas lofty language onstage
and his crass behavior at home After mulling over the double standard
for several days he sent Rama a note that he was leaving the Centre
Rama called him and shouted at him for roughly twenty minutes
Rama told him that he was a low life and that he was blowing it
for future lives Despite Ramas warning Tom left his apartment
and prepared to move back to the east coast A day or two later
Dana told me that Rama wanted me to track Tom down and have him
call the Centre When I succeeded at my Warriors task
Tom spoke with a very different Rama

Dont worry about all the negative karma Rama assured him
Ill absorb it for you Rama also told him that he was not really
leaving so much as he was being kicked out But I did not yet know
the details of Toms sudden departure as I sat in rush hour traffic
in Concord Massachusetts feeling dejected and lonely

I missed Fran I missed Kate and Pat each of whom I had gone out with
I missed Ed a quick witted UCSD recruit with a passion for mysticism
and Jimi Hendrix music We had studied together at a computer
school in Los Angeles and back in 1982 we had bicycled from San
Luis Obispo to Monterey California I missed Alexander and Marty
and Elizabeth and Carl and Karen and Jeff and

I missed my brother Dan had already left Chinmoy to join Ramas
Centre in San Diego But the closeness we once shared was buried
by too many months and too many miles by unspoken resentments on
his part and by a lust for power within Ramas organization on mine
Ultimately though it was the acquired belief that the past is dust
that kept us from searching and sifting through finer elements
of memories shifting sands

In 1983 my brother nearly left the Centre He had been hanging
out with Bill a burly bearded freedomloving forest ranger
who decided that Rama was taking advantage of women disciples or
to put it in his words Rama was dipping into the company ink
My brother too decided that Rama was out of line and the two
of them were planning to leave When Rama found out he summoned
me to his house

Your brother is about to blow it in a big way he told me
This is your big chance to help him Get him to call me I did
and Rama persuaded him to stay

I missed my friends and my brother and now as I roamed the
streets of Concord I wondered if I would ever see them again
I thought about contacting preRama friends but I feared that we
shared little in common Besides I had treated several of them
as if they were spiritually unrefined and now it felt awkward
to ask for their support

Later that day on my way to Walden Pond I saw a man in his seventies
walking slowly toward me Its an omen of death I thought nervously
Quickly turning back toward the car I saw a brief flash of light
a reflection from something I could not see

Its the Forces I told myself and slipped down a fearful
stretch of imagination back toward a nightmarish state of mind
Ramas Forces were back I got in the car and locked the door
I was scared I meditated a few minutes I asked the Infinite
for protection I drove around awhile I had no destination
I recalled something Rama used to say about reflections
I am like a perfect mirror If you ever perceive me in a
negative light you are seeing nothing more than a reflection
I pulled into a parking lot of a motel I found myself looking
for cars from Ramas tour group I found myself wondering where
the disciplesmy friendswere and what they were doing For years
we had been close like a tribe Suddenly I had an inspiration
set out across America and rejoin my tribe And how my spirit soared
And through the sleepless days and nights I searched Howard Johnsons
Best Western and Dennys parking lots across America for a black
Turbo Carerra

I had not forgotten the problems with Rama But I remembered
him telling me that through the good times and bad we would
always be family And what family doesnt have problems
I asked myself

I drove south to Stony Brook but did not find the group so in New York
City I paid a surprise visit to Tom When I told him about my quest
to find my tribe he seemed to understand what I was going through
But he had left the Centre roughly nine months before and had no interest
in returning That night I saw for the second time The Razors Edge
Maybe I can rejoin the group and be independent at the same time
I told myself as I began the drive west

Days later in San Diego I was showering at the UCSD gym when I
asked a guy if I could use some of his shampoo

Sure Mark take as much as you want was the reply

Wiping the soap from my eyes I recognized Gary a disciple
who had left Rama years ago I was glad to see him We decided
to go for a hike on Palomar Mountain I told him during the ride
that I had lost my tribe

He gave me an understanding smile I hear they have moved
to Laguna Beach

No kidding I said Would you like to go there instead of to Palomar
In less than two hours we sat eating cheesecake in Laguna Beach
Suddenly I saw Paul drive by

Theyre here I exclaimed and chased the car down Pacific Coast Highway
But I soon lost sight of my old friend from Stony Brook I walked back
polished off the cheesecake and drove Gary back to San Diego
The next day I returned to Laguna Beach I decided to wait by a
twentyfour hour banking machine an appropriate place it seemed
to stalk members of Ramas tribe

Alexander and Marty soon appeared searching for cash I was jubilant
to see them They were wary of me After a few minutes though
they seemed to forget that I was taboo Rama had put me down at one of the
Centre meetings They told me when and where the meetings were being held

They did not tell me what had happened after I left them in Boulder
The twentyeight had continued their journey east to Lincoln
Nebraska where Rama declared that they should move to whichever
cities they as individuals saw But when it looked like the group
was going to splinter Rama changed his mind and instructed them
all to move to Laguna Beach California

The next week I drove to the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills
I asked Al who was now in charge of security to ask Rama if I could
rejoin the Centre

I shuffled about nervously It may not be perfect I told myself
But at least its where I belong

Al returned after a few minutes Rama said okay

Did he say anything else I asked greatly relieved

Yes Al replied Rama said that its a tough world out there




19 Im Okay


When I rejoined the Centre I was determined to be a good disciple
I got a programming job in Newport Beach I studied advanced
topics in computer science at UC Irvine I rented a condo
for sevenhundredtwentyfive dollars per month based on Ramas
suggestion in Boulder I worked hard meditated deeply and stole
three eggs from a supermarket after Rama hiked the tuition again

Rama treated me with kindness Perhaps he believed that this time
I was really with him He invited me to his house He invited me
to the desert He invited me to partake in his chemical experiments

Roughly one hundred fifty miles southeast of the beaches of Orange County
in the Anza Borrego Desert State Park was a peak called Split Mountain
More than thirty miles away by the edge of the park was Casa Del Zorro
a cottagerenting resort catering to the upper middle class
Here Rama divined was a good place to drop acid in a group

During the drive to Casa Del Zorro a fastfood restaurant triggered
a flashback of Rama giving Sal and me LSD and taking us to MacDonalds
Whatever you do Rama had said dont order a strawberry shake
Rama and Sal proceeded to repeat the warning as if it were a mantra
Perhaps the drug magnified my sensitivity to the way Sal
parroted Rama Perhaps it magnified my sense of independence
Perhaps I was not in the mood for chocolate or vanilla I stumbled
to the counter and ordered a strawberry shake It was delicious
Rama and Sal looked at me disapprovingly I couldnt have
cared less

The memory of the MacDonalds trip made me smile Later as I
approached Casa Del Zorro I had a flashback of Rama giving me acid
at his home in Malibu I had been sitting on a rug in the living room
A Beatles record played You never give me your money
Rama entered the room

How are you doing kid he asked

Not so good I had been thinking about money The world
of my finances had appeared as menacing walls of debt that were
surrounding and closing in on me I felt miserable Tears formed
I told Rama what I was going through

Listen to the words of the song he said Oh that magic feeling
nowhere to go See kid Nowhere to go

I gazed at the floor

You need to take time and rethink your life he went on
Somehow you got entrenched in the dark side But life does not have
to be that way Life can be wonderful

Typically I would have felt elated by the attention he was giving me
It had been years since we were close But through hallucinating
eyes he seemed distant and small and his attempt to cheer me up
made me feel worse

Why dont you go jump in the pool he finally said
Years before in La Jolla he had often suggested Pool Therapy
as a way to douse the flames of a conflict burning within In Malibu
as in La Jolla my woes soon diffused among ripples from the impact
of one hand slapping

I played in the shallow end during that LSD trip until Rama
asked Sal who was not tripping to drive me home When we arrived
at my apartment I felt lucid creative fearless I started
to say whatever popped into my mind Sal looked surprised
He looked at me as if I were someone else

Sal offered to take me for a walk With my arms dangling and torso bent
I moved like an injured ape But gradually I slouched with Sals
support down the hill to the beach

Look Mark said Sal Theres the ocean

I looked to the frozen snapshot of the sea I blinked and the waves
rolled closerthen they froze again Then I saw whales diving and
breaching in slow motion I found myself among them We swam together
We spoke a silent language I thought I never knew I felt complete
They accepted me

Are you okay asked Sal holding me up

I longed for the freedom to roam I longed for the support of community
I looked to the sea but the whales were gone

Later that day I overheard Sal say to Rama You know Mark is
really bright

Of course he is Rama replied snapping his fingers
Hes quick

I appreciated the compliment But I wondered How could
I be bright and quick if I was also possessed and nonfunctional

The memory of the Malibu trip was fresh on my mind when I arrived
in the Anza Borrego Desert and approached Casa Del Zorro
Soon I sat waiting in the cottage with Sal Bill and Al
Rama arrived late He looked doughy faced and haggard He said he
was stressed out and exhausted Perhaps he was in more of a rut than
we were

Rama distributed the stamps Later he drove us to the top
of a hill where he had us watch him At some point I threw up
My awareness that I was me faded in and out Behind my opened
or closed lids flashed continuous multicolored explosions
From the chaos formed a spot and the spot became shapes
and the shapes became symbols I startled myself when I realized
that I had been gazing in my minds eye at the word eliot
Perhaps as the rug of my ordinary perception was wrenched out from
under me I needed something solid such as my middle name to hold
on to

I found myself sitting in the cottage observing the way in which I
thought about my thoughts I noticed that my thoughts arrived
in the form of words I could read and understand them or I could
hide from them and let them pass When Rama started to speak
his words were tightly packed and it was difficult to hide
He talked for what seemed an eternity Hours later when Rama decided
to drop acidwhich he may not have done since the early 70sI had
for the most part come down from my trip

Roughly fortyfive minutes after Rama took the drug he called
me into his room He lay in bed His hair was messy
His face was contorted He seemed disturbed Is it okay
he asked meekly

Its okay Rama I said

Are you sure

I looked at him tossing and turning I remembered how he had
repeatedly knocked me down psychologically helped me and knocked
me down again I remembered how he had often told me that revenge
was worth waiting for I had the sudden urge to help him up
and knock him down But my anger quickly dissipated when I realized
that trembling before me lay not ruthless Rama but rather the shell
of a thirtyfouryearold man named Fred Lenz

Im sure I said

I had an idea A beautiful blue bird is here Rama I whispered
Birds I knew were something he genuinely loved

He looked confused

Yes its a beautiful blue bird and its large and friendly
and its flying all aroundthere it goes Rama dont you
see it

He followed my finger with his eyes as if he were seeing
the imaginary bird and soon he fell asleep with a smile across his face

As he slept I thought about what had just happened An incarnation
of God I realized would not have had a bad LSD trip Rama was
not who he said he was He was not one of twelve fully enlightened
souls on the planet He was an ordinary man he was vulnerable
and I wanted to believe he was my friend

After about thirty minutes Rama awoke He lifted his quivering
hands above his head Did you see that he asked

See what Rama

I am filling the room with light The powers are cycling through me
I am reattaining enlightenment

Uhoh I thought Here we go again

Rama seemed utterly fascinated by his hands which he wiggled
and waved in front of his face

An uneasy feeling permeated my gut I recalled the aftermath of his
last enlightenment Just because he believes that hes perfect
I thought why should I suffer I recalled a few of his more
outlandish claims He had lectured a doctor about the nature of illness
Disease is merely the result of a difference in vibrations
He had taken credit when his father survived a coronary bypass operation
He had taken credit when disciples got decent jobs

I now realized that if I were to remain a disciple I would need
to humor myself about Ramas claimslest I rekindle the debilitating
conflict between my rational and mystical natures I had the impression
that Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters kept a sense of humor
about their experiments and I wondered how they might deal with
someone afflicted with Ramas particular brand of enlightenment
I recalled reading in The Electric KoolAid Acid Test that one
prankster often said Yeah Yeah Right Right Right

Thats it I decided When Rama starts getting out there
Ill say to myself Yeah Yeah Right Right Right

At that moment Rama raised his arms again Do you see it
he quavered

I see it Rama Golden light is filling the room
Yeah Yeah Right Right Right I thought

Rama waited for me to continue describing the Light which I did
and though I was lying and probably fanning the flame I supposed
this would beat an ongoing dark night of the soul

Rama now looked directly into my eyes I could not recall him
doing so except during lectures and meditations since 1981
We used to be friends he murmured What happened

Rama I dont know

Should there be any problems between us he asked

I felt that this was Fred trying to break through and I struggled
to hold back the tears

You and I used to be friends he continued But then
something happened We should be friends Would you like that

Yes Rama

He smiled at me with big puppy eyes

I told him that Sal Bill Al and I had maintained a high consciousness
earlier that day before he arrived We talked about what we hoped
to gain from the power drug Rama It was as if we were spiritual warriors

Rama looked at me resolutely You are spiritual warriors
he said Then he lay back down and fell asleep I felt happy
and selfconfident

When Rama awoke he turned to me and said You are okay
You are on the net

On the what

The net The network The psychic energy network

Really Yeah Yeah Right Right Right

Yes

Rama who wanted to see who else was on the net hobbled out
to the living room where Sal and Al quietly sat

Are you on the net Rama asked them

Yes replied Sal who had always been adept at learning rules
to new games

Rama looked at him suspiciously when suddenly the phone rang
It was Dana Rama told her that she was on the net seeing as
how she had called at so auspicious a moment So he told her
its me you Mark and Sal He paused and said Sure Mark
is on the net Hes quick like mercury Hes right there

I realized it was less a network than it was Ramas net but I
was happy because the man I had once been friends with was back
I was also happy because my conflictdiffusing strategy seemed to
be working

The following morning I greeted Rama

He squinted his eyes and looked away

Is anything the matter I asked

Oh yes he answered haughtily I know all about it

About what I thought we were friends

Oh sure he replied I know all about that part of you
Thats the part that wants to control me

Rama I said looking him squarely in the eye You have two
very different sides And I like the other one better

In the weeks that followed Rama mostly ignored me until he
uprooted the four hundred or so disciples from southern California
to the suburbs of Boston At the last meeting in Beverly Hills
he called me to the stage put his hand on my forehead and said
The Infinite is naming you Agni

The entry in my journal for the following day April 4th
1985 reads yea got my spiritual nameAGNIFireBreaker
of IllusionsVisionThird EyeNow everything is totally
fresh  newI feel good

I liked the name It represented the spiritual progress I had made
despite the difficulties of the past few years As I caravanned
across America in Ramas group the new name boosted my confidence

It was springtime in New England Rama rented a large house
in Needham Massachusetts and held Centre meetings in a church
in Boston Many disciples followed his suggestion and moved
to Concord Lincoln or Wellesley I moved to Wayland

One day I bought a copy of Walden by Henry David Thoreau
My journal entry for June 15th 1985 reads Economics chapter
in Waldendidnt provide any answers but caused me to ask questions
which lead to a variety of possibilities

One question I asked myself was how can I pay off my debt One solution
I came up with was commute to work by bicycle The entry continues
By driving to a free lot in Arlington parking and bicycling
the remaining 78 milessave 100month instill spirit back in me
get exercise  strength pass Harvard  MIT daily for brain power
bike around Boston lunch time meet girls at Faneuil Hall
be independent mobile selfreliant

The following day I bought a used threespeed for fortyfive dollars
and put the plan into effect Each weekday I parked in a free lot
pedaled several miles along the Charles River and braved downtown
traffic as I sped to work which was located two blocks from the site
of the Boston Tea Party I began to think of myself not as Ramas disciple
but as a bicyclist On June 29th 1985 I wrote i am a bicyclist
that is my nature swift light strong  sure motion speed
agility pivotable flexible colorful selfpropelled motivated
bad forces beware i am back and im riding high
thats me Agni free spirit go now and do not look back

It felt good to be pursuing a dream of my own But I sensed that
Rama would equate my project with the Negative Forces so I chose
not to tell him about the daily commutes and my newfound esteem

Perhaps as a result of my new streetwise sense of self I grew
increasingly critical of Rama Another entry for June reads
What really pisses me off is that Rama changes everything he says
contradicts himself turns a situation around completelyso you
never have a handle on him

The following week Rama invited me to a group LSD trip at his house
On July 7th 1985 I wrote may be a picnic LSD trip tomorrow
at Ramas my intent is to change my view of reality completely
with particular attention given toward becoming someone who has
a girlfriend becoming my own person ie my happiness 
wellbeing is not hinged upon the absence parents or presence
Ramagirlfriend of any personsto regain my kinship with
the earthto renew my excitement in life to regain my integrity
selfreliance and confidence

The next day Rama distributed drugsoaked stamps to ten or so
followers in his living room He let us wander around the house
Hours later he called us to the living room and began to talk
And talk And talk I tried to understand how his words
were affecting us I thought in terms of computers I decided
that he had rebooted us with LSD and now as we were coming down
he was downloading his wordy operating system to our unformatted
receptive minds

Hes formatting us like floppy disks I thought I was about
to plug my ears with my fingers when suddenly I remembered that I
had brought my journal I retrieved it and sat back down
Rama was still talking In the upper right hand corner
of the page where I typically included the date I wrote
timeless I was still high Then I wrote the basic Agni
Operating System boot breath deeply 2x Take your time where is
your stomachewho has control of it NOTE nothing else matters
who ever is letting or not letting you take deep breaths of airif
this is someone other than me eliminate them you breathe
You take it ez get good exercise Learn ANYTHING at a pace healthy
for you So 2 traps to avoid 1 other peoplewho live my life
not me living my life 2 people trying to help me but i take
it wrong due to 1 whatever TRIP youre on remember breathing
remember who you arenever look to others to patchAgniYou
must be strongeven now i am drawing upon a very healthy basic
energy that supports me That so is good But over the last
7 years i have been always rushing to meet someone elses gap
No thanxEveryone is the same Some people think they are special
No

Rama was talking about American Indians They weave peoples attention
he said to help sell their products

I wrote always be moving ON YOUR OWN STEAM accept NO substitutes
everything has power some things are good others not

Rama asked what I was doing

Im writing in my journal I replied

What have you written

I read the last few sentences aloud

Some things have more power than others he editorialized
Then he began talking about me He spoke about how when I
had lived with him I made shakes in the blender with all kinds
of strange ingredients

Why did Agni make these shakes he asked the disciples

No one answered

One he continued there was power to them
Two to attract attention Three this boy is an asshole

I wrote Asshole and drew a circle around the word Then I wrote
ok but it is me so fine

A few minutes later Rama said Fake obvious things fool everybody
Then he said Humans are continually knocking on your door
As long as they are alive they try and suck your power You need
to get strategic and learn to intensely dislike them Cut them
Push them awayanything to get them to fuck off

I wrote cold

About an hour later Rama had us watch The Adventures of Buckaroo
Bonzai on the VCR I sat several feet back from the group
After the movie Rama announced Someone is way off Can anyone see
who it is

The disciples glanced at me

Of course you all know that its Agni Now whats the matter baby

I told him that things in my life were not working out
I told him that I needed to try something new

If you wish to leave please dont bring everyone else down

Sorry Rama

When I got home I wrote good i feel much better already
keep breathing slow keep remembering Mark Eliot is the breather
Before he met any of these people he was the breather so too after
Before he dreamed himself into a don JuanCC Carlos Castaneda
world extravagansaFredhes cool But he was formatted improperly
by a bad occultist Simple He also wanted to be a Guru told me
so in a UCSD parking lot But cool guy Powerful attention level
Controls every situation impeccably cares about others what seems
to be an enormous amount Yet detached cold warm whatever he
was projecting A master illusionist Createds dreams  realities
with the flick of a wrist This has not been healthy for me
7 years occult training school has wiped me Nothing wrong with it
taught by an impeccable 8th degree Black belt only I dont handle
it too well So I recognize i tried something and it didnt work
I have the humility to realize that it isnt working for me
And for God sakes try new things in your life as FDR says
But Fred is definitely bent out of shape Let your hate grow
devil refs paranoia Not to blame him Had weak 1st attention
as a kid DadTeacher bent Important i believe that
the good side of Fred respects what I am doing  wishes me well
i have no desire to speak or see anyone with whom I didnt know 7 12
years agoStill coming down here from 3 hits of 67th Acid trip
Good thing boy does that stuff make me sick good for changing though
thrown away much unk stuffThe journey Eliot Mark Laxer
has just begun Dont turn back Go  keep moving
I have graduated 7 yrs an EKATEST Electric Koolaid Acid Test
Congrad

That night I wrote to Robert the disciple who had gotten shot
the past 45 years have been a bad trip a bad format
i was getting sicker weaker it is necessary for my well being that i
live off my own power i have no need to convince you of this
this my body knows my body has been telling me for years
to leave Rama Finally he stopped convincing me to stay
Then i couldnt make it on my own So i left  came back
Now im stronger off my own steamunlike past times when i left Ramas
Attention field im not going to waste thoughts  power on the past
The past peoples thoughts about me my thoughts about me
are all like Natelys Whore in Catch22 only she misses
and i jump

About a week later Dana called me with a Warriors task
Rama she explained wanted me to get former disciple Tom to call him

I told her that I was not looking for a Warriors task
or any task for that matter You know I have left the Centre
I said

Dont you think you might be following your gut feelings
she asked

You bet

I also followed my gut feelings during the group acid trip earlier
that month when Rama asked the disciples to remain inside
I had walked outside and watched the small birds fly The bottom line
is that hes wrong about me I thought my selfconfidence germinating
the way pine seeds flourish when their cones are scorched by fire
Im not possessed by demons mentally ill or bent on destruction
Im okay




20 The Last Supper


In August 1985 I began spending time with old friends and with people
from work I felt awkward I did not know what to talk about
They used words like concerts bar hop chaser dive dude hot babe
married pregnant job security tax break investment global economy
third world cold war Reagan Saturday Night Live and Letterman
Their language felt alien to me They used party as a verb not as a noun
They used to see as a way to describe what they did with their eyes
and with their mind not what they did with their inner being
I learned to navigate within their world but felt like I did
not belong

The initial reentry into society was difficult in other ways
I found myself constantly reverting back to Ramas world of fear
isolation and selfdoubt When I had eye contact with someone
for instance I had to remind myself that my reservoir of mystical
power was not being drained When I saw a flicker of light
I had to remind myself that the reflection was not Negative Forces
When a nondisciple told me of his or her hopes and dreams I had
to remind myself that theirs was not simply a world of illusion
And when I thought of my own hopes and dreams I had to remind
myself that I was not a mentally ill zombie unable to deal with the
real world

I realized that Rama had taught me to think this way
I also realized that I could in time unlearn these associations
I told myself I was doing okay I was doing well at my job
I was saving money and paying off loans I was commuting to work
each day by bicycle I was slowly getting stronger

One day I had a conversation with the vice president of my company
I respected him He seemed to be creative bright and energetic
He told me that he read a great deal I try to learn many
different philosophies he said A philosophy that discourages
you from learning other philosophies is a good one to avoid
I liked his approach to knowledge I was impressed that such wisdom
was available in an office building in downtown Boston I was impressed
that in his own way my boss was a seeker

Another weekend a childhood friend invited me to a beach party in New York
There I met Christina a young woman with long legs and deep blue eyes
I started driving to New York often One evening the phone rang
I had been expecting a call from Christina

Hi Agni said a womans voice It was Dana

I should have changed my number I thought

Theres going to be a meeting at Ramas for the Stony Brook group
she said Can you make it

Im doing okay on my own I reminded myself I dont need
to see Rama

Rama said its going to be our last meeting together she added

I nearly laughed He had been holding last meetings for years
I wondered if he were trying to suck me back into his organization
I thought about the disciples and about my brother I had not seen them
in weeks Ill be there I told her

Late the following night I rode my threespeed toward Needham
Rama typically conducted business between two and four am
because the worlds psychic energy was calm and perhaps
because disciples at that time tended to be tired and off balance
Yet as I pedaled through the dark and empty streets blood pulsed
quickly through my veins I felt alert I wore all black
Black for me was a symbol of power I wore around my neck a string
with a bicycle lock key I had worn such a string during bike
trips of my youth before locking on to Ramas path The key was
a reminder that waiting just outside Ramas door was the trusted
threespeed

I entered the house The disciples seemed friendly toward me
Rama approached He said You look much better Agni

I offered him a classical music tape This was my way of saying
that I harbored no ill feelings

He accepted

It was well past midnight and the twelve had arrived Actually there
were only ten but we counted Toms spirit We also counted Lakshmi
the Centres patron goddess

Rama served a red wine which he said was expensive I recalled
that weeks before he had counseled disciples to avoid alcohol

He showed us a cake decorated with the image of a frog You will get
some cake after the meeting he said as though addressing a group
of children The decoration reminded me of Kermit I wondered
if he had reincarnated the symbol as part of a spiritual lesson
or if it was just icing on the cake

A few minutes later Rama put on electronic music picked up
the original Bliss puppet and started to dance

The disciples watched their faces aglow with adoration I wondered
if I used to look like that Dont watch I thought and walked away
In a corner of the room I quietly danced with a Bliss of my own

The music stopped Rama instructed us to sit in a circle in the living room
I hesitated Something about this doesnt feel right I thought
I sat down nonetheless and meditated with the group

Roughly fortyfive minutes later Rama began to speak about the rapid
deterioration of the earths psychic energy field His language
sounded strange to me Terms such as Entities and occult attack
no longer seemed natural

Several minutes after that Ramas bright friendly eyes
suddenly hardened Instead of aspiring to the higher worlds
he accused you are evolving into a horde of angry sorcerers

What am I doing here I wondered I dont have to listen
to this

You are trying to increase your personal power by attacking each other
and mein the Dream Plane he charged I have no choice
but to disband your Circle Of Power

This is why he called us here I thought The tension in the room
felt like nails in my stomach I glanced at the door

Rama explained that our final task before he disbanded the Circle
was to take turns confronting one another It is very important
for each of you to voice what is really going down he said

The people in the orginal inner circle had been through a lot together
The first few seemed reluctant to adopt his suggested role as angry
fingerpointing sorcerers They said things like I think you may be
sending me some bad vibrations in the inner worlds

Rama frowned You think you are acting like Warriors but you
are really acting like wimps If you dont fess up now
it will be extremely difficult for you to continue making spiritual
progress later on

Youve been attacking me in the Dream Plane my brother accused
me and several others

Youve been trying to steal my power for years countered Sal
when it came his turn

Yes approved Rama

Instead of listening and preparing for my turn I recalled the way Big
Nurse inspired patients to rat on each other Rama is manipulating us
I thought Hes getting us to turn on one another Hes dividing us
Divide and conquer

Suddenly it was my turn I did not know what to say I stood up
The others had remained seated I turned to Rachel I have
always liked you I thought I said We have gotten along well
I dont see any problems between us

Rama looked surprised This was not the kind of response he
had in mind

Rachel smiled at me

I turned to Suzanne You say that I suffer from delusions that
Im Luke Skywalker Perhaps I said I hardly even know you

I turned to Dana Ive had a crush on you since the time
in the San Diego airport under the palms I said I dont know
if youve been sending me sexual energy or what but for years
Ive been very attracted to you

She raised her eyebrows So did Rama So did the others
I had broken a taboo Sexual attraction was not something we were
supposed to discuss particularly in a group particularly with Rama
particularly regarding one of Ramas women and particularly
regarding Dana who along with Anne was Ramas closest disciple

I turned to Anne If only I were older I said I feel
the same way about you

More looks of surprise

I felt exhilarated I was not accustomed to voicing my gut feelings
I turned to Sal No old friend Im not trying to steal your power
I said You have gotten a little paranoid over the past few years
I hope you can work it out

He frowned

I turned to Donna Are you still planning to marry Rama
I said I have no problem with you

She nodded

I turned to Paul Whats the penguin doing on the tehlee
I said We are friends

He grinned

In other words Rama interrupted you have Paul wrapped around
your finger You have learned much His twisted compliment threw
me off balance and I failed to defend the sevenyear friendship

I turned to my brother Love ya bro I said I am not
attacking you in the Dream Plane

Oh no Rama interrupted again

Im not conscious of it

Oh sure youre not mocked Rama Then in a professorial voice
he explained how in each family only a limited amount of power could
be passed to the offspring Typically one child claims most of it
The others are often so drained that they dont even notice
its gone

Rama is an only child I thought

Agni used to have the power he went on Now Dan has it
They will have to fight each other for the rest of their lives

Thats bull I shouted

The disciples looked shocked No one spoke that way to Rama

Now I was angry It was still my turn I turned to Rama
My heart was pounding Why do you tell Dana to tell me to tell
Tom to call you Why cant you call your old friend on your own
Youre playing power games I said Youre a grown man You have
a PhD You run a computer company and a spiritual organization
Given three phone numbers I think you should be able to contact Tom
by yourself I sat down stunned I had spoken honestly to Rama
It was invigorating

Thats going to be a tough act to follow admitted Rama
Then he began to speak Within minutes he transported me
with a tranquilizing voice and abstract language inside a fuzzy
familiar bubble where words were not questioned and consciousness
seemed high I found myself being drawn into his world
It was comforting being back Earlier he had given me some play
That made me feel important I let my thoughts drift aimlessly about
I found myself gazing without blinking into his eyes
I found myself mesmerized by the sound and the rhythm of his words
Somewhere far away I found myself floatingmy vision blurredthings went
fuzzy

Hey I thought bursting the mental bubble Hes formatting
us againonly this time without the LSD

I stood back up I was ready for action I did not know what to do

Rama stopped talking squinted his eyes and aimed his index finger
at me

I recalled a scene from The Last Wave a movie Rama once took me
to see in which a sorcerer kills a man by pointing a death bone
at him

I now saw Rama as both friend and foe mentor and tormentor
Christ and antiChrist I was frightened and confused
Estranged yet held by his seductively androgynous authoritative face
I lapsed into a meditative stupor

A glint of light caught my eye and snapped me out of the trance

Rama was chanting something in a low monotonous tone

I seized the string with the bicycle lock key I pictured bright
purple sparks and blue lightning bolts radiating in all directions
from the key The light shielded me from attack and lit the path
to the door

Gotta go I said and slowly walked away

Ive got your number Rama replied still pointing his crooked finger

Youre full of it I returned and stepped outside Here the light
was soft and grey A morning dove cooed The bicycle was there for me
It was 1985 and I was twentyfive

In the months that followed I occasionally bicycled to Walden Pond
where I read about Thoreaus experiment with selfreliance Distracted
by haunting memories I gazed at the water in search of calm
but the wind spawned new waves and the surface swelled with complexity
Theres plenty of time to sort it out I reassured myself
Maybe Ill take myself for a ride across America and do
some thinking




21 Bicycle RideThe Continental Divide


Three months into the crosscountry bicycle trek I pulled off the road
west of Walden Colorado I was stuck The problem was not so much
the physical journey True I was towing additional weight because
towns were farther apart and because Nunatak was no longer a pup
But my leg muscles were rock solid from the miles in Massachusetts
New York the southern tip of Canada Michigan Wisconsin Minnesota
South Dakota Wyoming and Colorado and I felt confident I could
ride to the coast

The problem was more the inner journey The more I thought
about Rama the more I understood The more I understood
the more I wanted to write If I wrote I might publish
If I published I would betray Rama If I didnt publish
I would betray those whom I might have warned I thought
Damned if I do damned if I dont I became emotionally exhausted
I decided to end the bike trip return to school and take a break
from the past

But I still wanted to believe that Rama was a powerful incarnation
and that I was an advanced soul of sorts I did not yet understand
that only when I checked my desire to soar like Icarus too close
to the sun would the impasse disappear and I would accept who Rama
was and who he was not

That night on a bed of wildflowers I petted the husky and gazed
at the canopy of stars A warm breeze carried the scent of pine
I felt at peace I was proud and relieved that I had used my rational
side to alter the course of my bike trip when my world was in need
of balance I looked forward to hitchhiking west with the dog
I looked forward to school I took slow deep breaths and
listened to the silence of the valley My thoughts ebbed into
a sea of calm Flecks of starlight grew brilliant and close
I felt complete I lost awareness of the passing of time
Suddenly I realized I had been meditating I felt surprised
I had not consciously meditated since leaving Rama one year before
Yet the state of mind felt oddly familiar and I tried to
understand why

I thought about the meaning of meditation To meditate I supposed
was to concentrate and reflect on thoughts images or phenomena
It was to work in a garden or stand in a subway and listen to
currents of the mind It was to lose track of time completely
absorbed in memories of a friend It was to gaze down the highway
of light where the sun lit into the sea There were as many ways
to meditate it seemed as there were facets on the jewel of the
human condition

It occurred to me that I had meditated on the first day of
the bike trip at Walden Pond I had become immersed in watching
waves rise and fall and in listening to them lap the shore
Their pattern suggested a rhythm unlike any I had followed
When a friend asked which route I would take I smiled
My plan was to follow the setting sun

Now stretched out on a sleeping bag in northern Colorado I realized
that I had started and ended the bike trip in spontaneous meditation
I recalled other times during the journey that I had meditated
I gazed for instance at the bands of bright color which arched
from drenched cow fields to the luminous Wisconsin sky
I gazed at the blur of the Minnesota pavement when the wind was
strong and at my tail I pondered an encounter with a young
sixpackcarrying Native American who when I mentioned the spirit
of South Dakotas land told me he had sold his for a bundle
of cash I contemplated an encounter with a Vietnam veteran
in Rapid City who said his death was near and whose shirt read
AGENT ORANGE KILLS I meditated on the meaning of a bumper
sticker in Wyoming that read MY OTHER CAR IS A HORSE
I reflected on Nunas response when I encouraged her to help pull
the rig The nearly fullgrown husky had sat down and scratched
her ear

The primary focus of the bike trip meditations though had been on my
years with Rama I had meditated for instance on the LSD trips
During the intense rush of the drug my acquired knowledge of myself
and of the world around me peeled away like layers of an onion
It was as if I saw the world through the eyes of a child Hours later
as the effects of the acid began to wear off it was as if I saw
the world through the eyes of a young man whose selfconfidence had not
yet been shaken Rama who observed me during each trip mostly let
me reform the layers which made up me on my own The next wave
of subjects in his chemical experiments would not be as fortunate
see Epilogue

I meditated during the bike trip on how over the years
Rama flipped between caretaker personalities more frequently
and how starting in 1984 the flipping grew sudden and extreme
This unnerving phenomenon could be seen in the stages of his
LSD trip Perhaps inadvertently he had designed a multileveled
personaflipping program of sophisticated spirituality to mask
advanced symptoms of schizophrenia

I meditated on what had happened the night I left the Centre
When I followed my gut feelings and spoke honestly to Rama and to
the inner circle Rama responded by turning my brother against me

It did not matter to me during the meditations on my brother
that Ramas childhood had been difficult Rama had told me that his
father was power hungry and cold and that his mother was wacky
and liked to take drugs Nor did it matter that Rama had probably
sought to fill the vacuum of his early years with promiscuity
LSD devotion to a guru money expensive cars and property
and consummate power over hundreds of peoples lives Nor did
it matter that his confusing set of personalities had probably
developed from a simultaneous belief that he was a hustler on
the one hand and a living legend and god incarnate on the other
Nor did it matter that I wanted to forgive him

When I meditated on the casual diabolical way in which he pitted
my brother against me my understanding and forgiveness vanished
I tensed my gut and wrestled with a primal image
The water was red I shuddered I saw my brother clearly
He had an open bleeding heart I knew how that felt I saw him
treading water There was no bottom I knew how that felt too
A great white shark circled rising effortlessly from the depths
I clenched my fists There was nothing I could do Dan could not
hear me

I meditated on what had happened later that night after Rama
rooted his divisive legacy in my brothers mind When Rama pointed
his finger at me I knew that he was trying to intimidate me
I also knew that he was trying to maintain some semblance of control
But I feared that he might be a sorcerer I intentionally visualized
sparks and bolts of protective lightning radiating from the bicycle key
I understood that the colorful explosions were emanating from the world
of my imagination But that did not stop me from seeing them
The scene unfolding before me was after all not just another ending
to a Castaneda book It was real And I needed all the inspiration I
could generate

The meditations during the bicycle journey helped me comprehend
and come to terms with an earlier journey When I was sixteen
I sought fellowship Truth and that which lies beneath
the surface world of reason I came to believe that I could
find these things by studying with a sorcerer in a desert
in Mexico by gazing at an underexposed photograph of a fully
enlightened Indian man and by following the etiquette of a warm
funny brilliant personaflipping man with a PhD in English
I later looked to Gandhi and to William Shirer for answers
But as I rode west from Concord Massachusetts I found a teacher
inside myself and the lessons worked for me

I learned that it is important not to follow someone blindly
even if he is truly childlike humble selfgiving and SelfRealized
even if he is a friend and particularly if he is reluctant
to openly admit that he can be seduced by his power over others
Genuine teachers encourage their students to question them throughout
the entire apprenticeship because genuine teachers accept their
own imperfect human nature

I learned that it is important to balance the mystical with
the rational Meditation tends to open the mind to suggestion
The art of the mystic seems to be therefore to know when to let go
be spontaneous and open up to the universe and when to gain control
use the power of reason and protect the body mind and soul

I learned too that it is not necessary to focus on a leader
a philosophy or a technique to contact deep mystical currents
By facing intense sunlight and storms during the bike trek I was
in direct contact with the ancient transcendental kingdom of nature
By observing my thoughts clarify as they projected and pulsed over fields
lakes and mountains I drew closer to the land to the creation
By wrestling with winds born of colossal power I was forced to make
constant leaps of faith to merely carry on But now sitting by
the Eskimo dog I contemplated the awesome blackness of the night
I was unaware that the bicycle journey itself had been a natural
expression of mysticism

The following day I ascended the purple peaks of the Continental Divide
The sky was clear the wind calm A sign indicated that waters
to the east flowed toward the Atlantic and to the west the Pacific
It did not indicate that the waters might return and follow
a different path I dismounted the 12speed Fragments of Ramas
deepest hooks still lurked in my heart But I was doing better now
The healing process had begun Facing the east while walking
backwards to the west I quickly retracted my thumb whenever a vehicle
or driver seemed unsuitable or unsafe to take me for a ride




Epilogue


Hidden between UCSD and the Pacific Ocean were burial grounds
Rama said that were sacred to Native Americans Surfers on their way
to Blacks Beach passed through this land of cliffs and ravines
They pointed to a graceful white mansion and said Heyyy duuuude
thats Atkinsons place duuuuuuuuude Several properties south
of the UCSD Chancellors mansion lay a burnedout car abandoned
on a charred foundation The address seemed to be 951 but in my
mind the missing tile was in place 9514 La Jolla Farms Road
where Rama became enlightened and where I moved into darkness

It was 1988 I parked my Volkswagon Bus at a mall oneandahalf
miles east of campus and walked with Nunatak toward the sea
I had cut through the notyetbulldozed chaparral just east of
Interstate5 many times since returning to UCSDa twentyseven year
old undergraduatebut now the sun was setting and the air seemed heavy
Suddenly I had a sense of where I was going During the past two years
I had dealt with my Rama experiences intellectually But you can
only sit cooly unmoved and protected on the capofthingsthatwere
for so long before the cap blows and sends you tumbling
There are many ways to grapple with the enormity of what lies beneath
the surface world of reason I approached 9514 La Jolla Farms Road

The last time I got near the place had been the year before with a friend
I lived there once with some radical people I had told her
One of them becameenlightened

Do you want to talk about it she asked

Thats where Atkinson lives I said pointing away

Now as the sun sank in the Pacific I stood with Nuna on the edge
of the property I took a few steps forward but quickly stopped cold
I could almost hear Rama saying in his KermittheFrog voice
Make millions of people happy I stepped to where my room used
to be when suddenly superimposed over blackened concrete slabs
images appeared Rama was in the kitchen cooking for a hundred
spiritual seekers Rama was in the meditation room giving a talk
beside a largerthanlife photo of an Indian guru Rama was at
the same spot giving a talk beside himself Rama was in the garage
surveying stacks of WOOF Rama was offering me cookies to cheer me
up because I doubted his enlightenmentmy friends enlightenment
Rama was hopping around the house like a kangaroo and I was right
beside him and we were laughing like children and at that moment
in the fading light the cap blew and tears streamed down
my face

  

Over the next few years I grappled with conflicting images of Rama
Sometimes I saw him as a friend Other times I saw him as a
semienlightened seeker or as a powerful sorcerer But the more I
researched his past the more I discovered he was human

He was born Frederick P Lenz III on February ninth 1950 in Mercy Hospital
San Diego He was raised Catholic in Connecticut where he lived
alternately with his grandparents aunt and uncle and father
His parents divorced when he was a child His father remarried
joined a yacht club and in 1974 was elected mayor of Stamford

In 1967 Fred graduated from Rippowam High School The following
description of him appears in the yearbook A streak of the unusual
chasing the beautiful hiding from the known Cutrate philosopher
monopoly on the side

At seventeen Fred left the east coast and experienced the mushrooming
of the psychedelic movement while living in San Franciscos
HaightAshbury district It was during the subsequent year
which he spent in prison for selling drugs that he was handed
a promotional brochure for Indian guru Chinmoy Kumar Ghose
Chinmoy whose path was paved with peace light and bliss
had several hundred followers worldwide including rock musicians
John Mahavishnu McLaughlin and Carlos Devadip Santana

Fascinated by Eastern philosophy and meditation techniques
popularized in the late 60s Fred returned to the east coast
where he studied the art of quieting the mind with Chinmoy
He also studied English at the University of Connecticut at Storrs
While still an undergraduate he married and divorced a Chinmoy
disciple named Pam built dulcimers in a wood shop in his basement
joined the university debating team and began hosting free public
lectures on meditation

Chinmoy who often asked disciples to start divine enterprises
asked this wellspoken Phi Beta Kappa graduate to start a laundromat
When Fred chose instead to enroll in a PhD program in English at
the State University of New York at Stony Brook Chinmoy kicked him
out of the Centre for roughly one year in an apparent attempt to teach
him obedience and humility

By the time I met Fred several years later Chinmoy had dubbed him
Atmananda or BlissoftheSoul whereas the State University
of New York at Stony Brook after accepting his dissertation
The Evolution of Matter and Spirit In The Poetry Of Theodore
Roethke had bestowed upon him the title Frederick Lenz PhD

  

Fundamental to my research on Rama were my discussions with
former disciples some of whom I tracked down and some of whom
I happened to meet at movie theatres airports and gatherings
of Amnesty International Talking and writing about my
experiences helped me to work out much of the emotional pain
Listening to what others had gone through also helped a great deal
But as I listened I realized that my darkest fear had come true
Rama had been getting progressively worse

In the fall of 1985 weeks after I left the Centre Rama disbanded
Lakshmi and encouraged roughly one hundred followers to move
from Boston to Los Angeles He directed these disciples to donate
their time to his software company Vishnu Systems

In 1986 Rama moved from Boston to Seattle with about eight
men and three inner circle women Laura Cindy and Anne
Once they arrived in Seattle Rama informed the three women that he
had asked them along specifically to satisfy his sexual appetite
He told them that they were to be his Geishas By then he explained
he needed to sleep with two or three women at a time an individual
he maintained had too little energy to stimulate him

He confessed to Anne that for most of his life something had been
hurting him keeping him down He told her that during a recent
trip to a family event he saw that his aunt and uncle had been
using their psychic powers all along to make him deathly ill
and to try to kill him He told her that I had been sending him
a great deal of Negative Psychic Energy and that in response
he had been sending me Entities so my life would be miserable
on a daily basis

Also in Seattle Rama repeatedly administered LSD to the three women
During their hallucinogenic trips he kept them up all night
shouted at them told them that they were possessed and tried to get them
to confess that they had incarnated on earth to destroy his mission
Then he threatened their lives

During one such episode described by Anne as nightmare weekend
Rama fed them acidfive or so hits eachand showed them his
new puppy

This dog is possessed he claimed citing its frequent need to urinate
and its habit of whining when confined alone in the basement
Rama then fed the dog seven hits of LSD Lookits still standing
he said in an effort to substantiate his claim Rama placed his hands
around the puppys neck and began to squeeze Earlier he had claimed
that the Evil Forces were trying to get to him through his pets
All of his pets he complained became demonically possessed
Now he continued to choke the puppy to the brink of death
Then he scowled at the three women and boasted that he had just used
his willpower to stop himself from eliminating this enemy
Through the sleepless night and following morning Rama repeatedly
told the women that the puppys situation was remarkably similar
to their own He reminded them that they had better confess

Barbara confessed Rama finally snapped Barbara has come clean
If you want to study with me in this or in any future lifetime
you had better come clean

After Rama left the room memories screamed across horrorfried
synapses of Annes aciddrenched brain the puppyhes strangling

When Rama returned to the room the three young women confessed

Weeks later when the women asked Rama about the health of the puppy
he replied that it had passed on to another world

Do you know how I did it he whispered With my will

Months later Rama announced to hundreds of followers No friends
I am not paranoid In fact three students recently confessed to me
that they had incarnated on earth to destroy my mission

Also in 1986 Rama wrote to followers A very close friend of mine
Jack Kukulan died several weeks ago I know Jack was a friend to many
of you We will miss him Jack was the best part of all of us
His tremendous help and economic support of the spread of meditation
has benefited many Jack died a warriors death

A squat man with dark curly hair and a sardonic smile Jack had applied
to be a student shortly after Ramas 1982 Berkeley lecture series
He had allowed the Bay Area postering crew to use his house as a base
of operation and seemed willing to help his new spiritual teacher
in any way that he could When Rama closed the San Francisco Centre
Jack sold his house and moved to southern California where he
continued to run an Oaklandbased fruit distribution company

Each week I stopped by Jacks Malibu apartment to pick up a crate
of fruit for Rama who lived down the block near Point Dume
Before I left Jack slipped me a small brown paper bag

Thats for you he said

Thanks I replied and I pulled out a plum

One time I asked him how he could run a company that was hundreds
of miles away

By making a lot of phone calls

Another time I invited him to see a movie

Cant make it he told me I need to take a client out to dinner

I nodded Big deal coming up

Yeah

Rama began spending time with Jack In 1986 they went on a trip
to Japan where Rama told him they had spent past lives together
Meanwhile Jack had donated to Rama not only numerous crates of fruit
but well over one hundred thousand dollars In fact Rama announced
at fundraising dinners that the disciples were off the hook
because Jack had donated yet another hundred thousand

On August 2nd 1986 fortyyearold Jack Kukulan was found in his apartment
partially decomposed before the shrine According to the police report
white powder was found on a nearby piece of paper and on the blade
of a knife from the kitchen According to the autopsy report
Jack died of heroinmorphine intoxication

In August 1986 Rama left Seattle Four months later he returned
to Boston where he reunited dozens of former followers
You should forgive each other and start anew he told them
Four months after that he instructed them to call and invite other
former followers to a very important meeting in Boston

Hundreds responded by flocking east from Los Angeles and from
other areas of the country

At the meeting Rama divided the congregation into the NO
YES and MAYBE groups as a way to determine who could
come back into his new nameless Centre He put the women
who had been with him the longest in the MAYBE group

They are the worst Rama declared explaining that they would
be required to pay off their bad karma with checks ranging from
1200 to 2000 a month each He then informed the MAYBE as well
as the YES disciples that if they wanted to study with him in this
or in any future lifetime they should prepare to move to Silicon Valley

Several hundred disciples made the move and attended Ramas first
gathering in Palo Alto California Anne and Rachel followers since
the Stony Brook days drove west together from Boston and arrived
a month later in time for the second meeting Rama asked them
and seventeen other inner circle women to work at the second meeting
They would check attendance lists and sell his books and tapes
which they had done many times before

During the meeting Rama warned the disciples in the audience
to make a mental note of the nineteen women working that night
They are witches he explained They have been incarnating
together since ancient Egypt They have been trying to destroy
my mission He cited as evidence the times he had gotten sick
that some of his hair had fallen out that pastlife students had been
kept from finding him and that current students had been sapped of
their energy

Briefly flipping to a less abusive persona Rama announced
that the nineteen women also happened to be his best students
But he said firmly they have been seduced by the dark side of
the forcethey seduce peoplethey band together in the demon world

Rama knew the women had recently left their homes quit their jobs
and traveled three thousand miles to be with him He knew their
devotion ran deep He then kicked them out before the entire Centre

Rama started a woman disciple from the audience I recently
dreamt that seven of the nineteen flew around me like witches

Rama nodded Recently he said they have networked and conspired
to murder Jack Kukulan

Several months later Rama gave Karen a Warriors task
He told her to call and instruct each of the nineteen to attend
a private meeting The meeting was to be held hundreds of miles
south of Palo Alto in an obscure park in the mountains of Malibu
It was scheduled for December 5th 1987the following night

They showed

Under the guise of helping them protect their careers Rama warned
the approximately thirty peoplethe nineteen women and about eleven
other disciplesthat newspaper articles targeting him in a negative
light were in the offing

He spoke to them about the case of Annie Eastwood A former follower Ms
Eastwood reported that during one encounter Rama had misled
her spiritually abused her psychologically showed her a gun
and demanded that she have sex with him Rama later told the press
At no time during our evening together with Annie did I brandish
a hand gun But now at the 1987 late night Malibu gathering
he admitted I did have a hand gun with me that night with Annie
but I did not wave it around

Later that night Rama asked five or six people to walk back
to the cars and wait in the parking lot Anne and Rachel remained

Rama faced the remaining disciples roughly half of whom had participated
in one of his group LSD trips If anyone asks you about LSD
he said somberly you all know that I gave you a placebo

Then Rama perhaps nervous about what I had observed in 1984 and 1985
told the disciples Mark was always a little young a little naive
a little stupidhe thought that I actually had given him LSDwe
all used to indulge himwe all knew that it was just that goofy
Mark again

Rama went on to say that one day they might have to explain all this
to a judge and jury But under no circumstance he warned
should they speak to the press

Toward the end of the meeting he told the nineteen that if they
wanted to return to the Centre in this life they must first hand
in an essaytyped doublespacedin which they were to confess
to and apologize for their hurtful wicked deeds

After the meeting Rama returned to his latest project
staging a national sixmonth six hundred and fifty thousand
dollar Zen seminar promotional campaign The effort included
the placement of a twopage spread in the Sunday New York Times
One page was a photo of himself the other advertised his free
talk on Zen and success at Alice Tully Hall Lincoln Center
see Appendix D The fullpage spreads also appeared in
the LA Times LA Weekly Los Angeles Magazine Vanity Fair
and in more than a dozen college campus newspapers across the country
including MIT Harvard Columbia UCLA UC San Diego San Diego State
UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara

Ramas aura of allegations came to light in the press in the midst
of his national speaking tour Newsweek Who Is This Rama

serious problems 2188 The LA Weekly The Cosmic Seducer

When articles began to appear Rama cancelled several talks
When more appeared he stopped giving public lectures altogether

In the spring of 1988 Rama had Karen call and instruct the nineteen
to attend a middleofthenight meeting in the Mohave Desert
scheduled for the end of April

Rachel and Anne individually expressed doubts about whether they
would attend

In the past Rama had used the fear of Entities and of bad
karma to discipline his disciples Typically he had explained
that he would try to protect those who strayed from his path
But by now his role had dramatically changed No longer the protector
he told disciples that if they disobeyed him he would see to it
that they had a car accident or that they came down with cancer
He had Karen warn Rachel and Anne that if they did not attend the meeting
they would come to serious harm

They showed

At the Mohave Desert meeting Rama announced that the nineteen
could return to the Centre move to Boston teach yoga and bring
him new students

Who does not want to come back he asked

Anne Dana and Rachel reached their hands into the desert sky

Afterwards the devotees stopped at Dennys restaurant for coffee
The dissenters sat together Rama approached Anne mentioned
that the brakes of her car were not functioning properly
and that she had had difficulty getting to the meeting
Rama took credit for the problem He said Let that be a warning
Then he told the three women that they had better not send him any
bad vibes

One out of twenty women gets breast cancer he told them
Five out of twenty women could get breast cancer Twenty out
of twenty women could get breast cancer Some women get cancer
of the uterus

  

I was shocked when I learned how Rama had treated Rachel Dana and Anne
I was shocked that Ramas world had gotten so out of hand
But according to what I read in the press the experiences of my
friends were by no means isolated

In 1990 Anne and I sat together and read Ramas sevenpage Statement
To The Press Near the start of the Statement Rama lists the names
of credible persons who can verify the truth of my assertions
I glanced at the names Karen Lever True she had been
accepted at a number of medical schools including Stanford
She was extremely bright But as Ramas mouthpiece
she was the one who had threatened dissenters with serious harm
Dr Wayne Surdam and Dr Ermano Rambaldi True they were an
awardwinning UC Berkeley scholar and a UCLA geologist respectively
True they had taken the study of spirituality to heart But they
had never gotten close enough to Rama to observe his other side
Richard Loftin I did not know him But during nightmare weekend
in Seattle he reportedly sat across from the three tripping women
and giggled

Rama continues in the Statement

 Annie Eastwood alleges that we had a single
 sexual encounter over five years ago in my
 home in Malibu California She has told the
 press that in hindsight she now views the
 sexual encounter we had together as forced
 She has alleged that during the course of an
 evening together I brandished a hand gun She
 then states that she had sex with me out of fear

Rama then claims

 at no time during our evening together did
 I brandish a hand gun

Anne looked up from the Statement and said But Rama explicitly
told us at the meeting in Malibu that he did take out a hand gun
that night with Annie

Maybe I replied Rama is playing off the difference in meaning
between holding and brandishing waving a hand gun

What Annie perhaps did not know Anne added and what Rama fails
to mention is that he nearly always slept with a gun by his bed

Rama writes

 Ms Eastwood continued to attend my seminars
 for another year after our night together
 This would not seem to be likely behavior on
 the part of a person who was allegedly forced
 to have sex at gunpoint

No I thought But perhaps on the part of a person who has been
psychologically and sexually manipulated and abused

Rama continues

 Now five years after the event and in concordance
 with a group of persons affiliated with Cult
 Awareness Network she has decided that a gun
 was present during our encounter and that she
 was forced to have sex with me Her story is
 absurd and untrue

 Lisa Hughes has asserted in a variety of
 interviews that I forced her to take LSD
 while she was a guest at my home during the
 summer of 1987 She also alleges that in
 some way which is not fully clear in her
 accounts I coerced her into having sex with
 me She further alleges that I bought her
 presents and that while she was on LSD I
 tried to convince her that she was possessed
 by demons

 I never gave Lisa Hughes LSD nor did I
 as Lisa Hughes asserts take LSD with her

 For a period of time during the summer of
 1987 Lisa and I traveled together I purchased
 some clothing for her and some luggage which
 she desperately needed

I recalled from press accounts that Rama had bought Lisa 17000
worth of clothes I also recalled how in 1984 Rama had told me I
was mentally ill when I tried to return the new car he had bought
for me

 During that summer while Lisa was a guest
 in my home Lisa and I were frequently joined
 for dinner videos and an occasional soccer
 game by our mutual friend Mr Richard Loftin

 Shortly before I started spending time with
 Lisa a close female friend of hers was killed
 in a brutal knife attack in a parking lot in
 Santa Barbara Lisa told me that she knew
 that the killer was also stalking her She
 told me that he was following her on campus
 and knew where she lived

 Lisa shared a small house in the Santa Barbara
 area with several men and one other woman She
 told me that she was certain that the killer had
 come into her house when no one was home She
 told me that this was possible because her
 housemates never locked the doors She said
 that it was only a question of time before she
 would be killed

 Out of concern for her welfare I gave Lisa
 some money to rent an apartment in a gated
 high security condominium complex so that she
 would be safe Just before Lisa graduated the
 killer was apprehended and I did not give the
 matter any more thought until she brought it
 up over the summer

 During the summer Lisa told me about the demons
 Her first revelations occurred in the early part
 of the summer As the summer progressed
 demons became all that she talked about

 One evening in the presence of Mr Loftin she
 said that she was convinced that demons had
 been directing the killer in Santa Barbara
 She also asserted that my home was filled with
 demons

Anne turned to me and said I dont know whether that is true
or not but he makes it sound as if he is perfectly normal
as if he is not obsessed with demons

I recalled how Rama had increasingly preached that most of his disciples
and most of the human racewere possessed by Negative Entity demons

And I know for a fact Anne added that Rama told us there
were demons in his house in Seattle

Rama writes

 She Lisa led Mr Loftin and I down into
 the basement and pointed to areas of the
 vacant air where she asserted that the demons
 lived She was also convinced that a demon
 lived on the second to the top stair of the
 upstairs staircase She told us that the
 demon that lived on the stair had caused her
 to fall down the stairs once and was continually
 trying to trip her

I recalled from press accounts that it was Rama who had climbed
a stepladder to clean invisible demons off the ceiling it was Rama
who had swept the stairs with his hands to avoid being tripped
by demons and it was Rama who wearing raingear and Indian beads
had spent hours in the basement grabbing at the air

Rama claims

 On another occasion while the three of
 us were chatting in my backyard Lisa
 told Richard and I that she had taken
 LSD and other drugs as a student at
 UC Santa Barbara

 She asked Richard if he knew where she
 could get some LSD and cocaine When
 he informed her that he had no knowledge
 of where she could get these drugs she
 became belligerent and angry

I recalled reading about Ramas treatment of Lisa He had allegedly
given her LSD Then as he had done to the three women in Seattle
he screamed at her for hours repeating that she was evil and that she
had been trying to hurt him

Rama writes

 Lisa told me she was afraid of her parents
 She was convinced that they were trying to
 psychologically control her It was only after
 I had repeatedly requested that she call her parents
 and inform them that she was staying with me
 as a guest that she finally did so

I recalled how Rama had instructed me to avoid speaking with my parents
unless I needed money

Rama continues

 Finally it became clear to me that it
 was time for us to separate I suggested
 that she return home to her parents and
 she insisted that the demons were possessing
 them too

 After Lisas refusal to return to her
 parents we agreed on a solution Lisa
 had expressed a desire to go to a local
 computer school I agreed to pay her
 tuition purchase her a car and give her
 enough money to get an apartment It was
 my hope that this would give Lisa a new
 start and help her to gain some perspective
 on her life

Rama goes on

 Nancy Knupfer a woman in her early
 forties attended some of my seminars a
 number of years ago She also entirely
 voluntarily donated a sum of money to
 help defray the cost of offering meditation
 classes free or at low cost to the public

Anne said Free or at low cost to the public Rama has a funny
concept of what free and low cost actually mean

Rama describes Steve Putnam who

 made a number of public accusations
 regarding the validity of the teaching
 process I engage in My seminars are frequently
 attended by Buddhist monks and teachers Dr
 Wayne Surdam an award winning Oriental scholar
 from the University of California at Berkeley
 also regularly attends I certainly feel that
 Dr Surdam is a better judge of the validity
 of my presentations of the Buddhist and Hindu
 philosophies and methodologies than is Mr Putnam

I recalled that the editorinchief of the Vajradhatu Sun
an international Buddhist newspaper once wrote of Rama Nobody within
the Buddhist tradition as far as I know has ever taken him seriously
New Age Journal The Rama Drama 6188

Rama continues

 Donald Kohl was a young man who at one time
 attended a number of my seminars in meditation
 and selfdevelopment In the Buddhist philosophy
 we strongly counsel persons against taking their
 own lives because of a negative karma that can
 be generated by this action I was touched by
 the fact that Donald said goodbye to me in the
 note he left before he died and I was deeply
 saddened to hear of his suicide I did not
 know Donald and I never spoke to him personally
 except in passing to say hello

Anne said to me Donald did not just attend a number of seminars
He was a student He saw Rama on a weekly basis He came
to Ramas house and ate dinner with us He came to parties
He went on desert trips He came to movies with us on Friday nights
Rama is trying to make it seem as if Donald had been some kind
of stranger

I replied Mr Kohl called me after Donalds death I spoke
with him for more than an hour I figured Rama would not want
me talking with him but I did anyway

Anne said I was at the Centre when Rama found out that Donald
had taken his life At first he looked very sad But the first
thing he said was regarding protecting himself from blame
He told us not to speak with Donalds parents except to say we
were sorry

Rama writes

 I can understand Donalds parents grief
 over the tragedy of their sons death
 In their pain they are understandably
 inclined to search for events and individuals
 they can use to explain or rationalize
 Donalds death However to attempt to
 attribute his death to his interest in
 meditation or to his attendance at some
 seminars I conducted on meditation and
 selfdevelopment is farfetched at the very
 least

 When examined individually the charges
 that these six persons have made against
 me have little validity or impact But when
 all of these people walk into a newspaper
 office together and tell their stories an
 avalanche effect occurs I can well understand
 how all of these allegations when presented
 at the same time could raise questions in
 someones mind regarding my conduct and
 character And until Jennifer Jacobs told me
 the story of her kidnapping I too was at a
 loss to explain how these individuals who
 attended my seminars at different times had
 come to join together in an orchestrated
 effort to discredit me

Rama begins the Kidnapping Of Jennifer Jacobs section of
the Statement with

 It wasnt until I encountered Jennifer Jacobs
 a woman who at one time attended some of my
 classes that I understood why I had become
 the target

Anne said At one time attended some of my classes
She was in the inner circle She worked for him She was one
of the nineteen witches He recommended where she should live
and gave her other personal advice

Rama writes

 Jennifers mind was violated in a variety of
 horrible ways She was kept awake for extended
 hours and forced repeatedly to view videos of
 Charles MansonJennifer was screamed at ridiculed
 and degraded She was constantly surrounded by
 guards and was never allowed to leave the motel
 Jennifer was told that she would not be released
 until she gave up her beliefs in the Buddhist
 faithher kidnappers also threatened that
 if she went to the police they would kidnap her
 again and that her family would have her
 committed to a mental institution for the
 rest of her life

Jennifer Jacobs parents maintain that their daughter was not
screamed at ridiculed or degraded Although neither Anne nor I
knew what had actually taken place with Jennifer Anne recalled
too well some of Ramas methods Our minds during nightmare
weekend in Seattle were violated in a variety of horrible ways
Rama kept us awake all night We did not see Charles Manson videos
We got to see Rama strangling his puppy instead Rama repeatedly berated us
He claimed we were reincarnated demons and were out to get him
He did not hold us prisoners but then again I would not advise
running off into the night on five hits of acid Rama said we could
come clean if we like Barbara confessed that we were trying
to destroy his mission He threatened that he would send us to hell
for thousands of lifetimes

Rama claims

 Cult Awareness Network and persons associated with
 it are participating in the very practices that
 they purport to be dead set against They are
 encouraging the abrogation of the personal
 and religious freedoms of adult American citizens
 through brainwashing methods and techniques similar
 to those employed by the North Koreans and
 North Vietnamese against American POWs
 I certainly am not in favor of cultswho is
 But I do not believe any person or organization
 has the right to incite the kidnappings of persons
 who are part of small religious organizations
 that are not cultsThis is a money making
 racket This Cult Awarenes Network is nothing
 more than McCarthyism in a new form

Anne and I read and reread this last section of the Statement
We glanced at each other for a momentbut said nothing

  

In 1990 I spoke with the three English professors who in 1976
had served on Ramas doctoral dissertation committee Louis Simpson
a Pulitzer prize winning writer told me he had written a poem
about a student a brilliant lecturer who creates his own system
rather than working within an existing one Simpson Louis
Herons and Water Lilies In The Room We Share New York
Paragon House 1990 Paul Dolan told me that Freds performance on
the PhD oral exams had been slightly above average Gerald Nelson
told me that while he had taken a liking to this graduate student
he had never thought much of Freds getrichandfamous schemes
including the one to boost his credentials via a mailorder
ministers degree

Fred once asked me what I thought of his idea for a book called The
Thirteen Mystics Nelson told me I joked that he would already have
a built in market for the sequel The Return Of The Thirteen Mystics
But Nelson had not taken lightly the way young Frederick had been
affecting undergraduates during his free lectures on meditation
In 1975 Nelson recommended that Fred read about Ken Kesey and about
Charles Manson The lesson was that while both charismatic leaders
had experimented with drugs and with young peoples lives Kesey learned
to check his power over others Manson did not

Yet it was difficult for me to guide Fred Nelson explained
Though he was my student he was Chinmoys disciple

Professor Nelson was a tall man with a strong kind voice
I wondered if Fred had been drawn to him in his search for a caring
father figure

I asked Nelson if he had read the newspaper accounts of Freds
recent schemes He nodded sadly This is the sort of thing
you would expect from an intelligent sensitive abused child
from a welltodo family Fred quite obviously needs help
but is probably too fargone to realize or admit it

In the mideighties Rama sent Nelson selfpromotional brochures
tapes and books in 1986 Rama wrote in a brochure that Nelson had
been one of the three most influential people in his life in 1988
Rama confessed to Nelson that he only wanted to make some money
that he no longer maintained a following and that he had finally
learned his lesson about Ken Kesey and about Charles Manson

Yet the more I learned about Rama through my continuing research
the less I was heartened by Ramas confession to his former mentor

In 1988 Rama persuaded many of the roughly three hundred disciples
to move to Reston Virginia and then to Westchester New York
He founded two forprofit organizations National Professional
and Personal Development Seminars NPDS and Advanced Systems Inc
ASI During regular meetings of NPDS and ASI he continued to teach
his disciples about spirituality He continued to experiment
with mind control He also experimented with new ways to
make money

Rama had been strongly encouraging disciples to study software
at the Computer Learning Center CLC a sixmonth technical school
which typically prepared people for entrylevel programming jobs

Several disciples including my brother Sal and Paul
had developed impressive track records in the software industry
But many were only CLC graduates During the meetings of NPDS and ASI
Rama told disciples to share their knowledge of stateoftheart
software technology Then he told them to lie According to
the San Francisco Chronicle Yuppie Guru Finds Cash in Computers
Devotees pay 3000 a month to sit at his feet 73092 Rama
in 1989 wrote a manual for disciples in which he encouraged them
to think of a resume as a mandala that reflects your new self
Rama wrote They will believe anything you say even when you
intersperse unrealities because they feel the truth of your experience
When you have your stories and images in place arrange for your references
Choose people from our group who are comfortable on the phone
who sound professional and who have had data processing experience
Give them a few notes about who they were

In 1991 Rama told New York Newsdays William Falk The Yuppie
Guru 73091 Its the most amazing career that I know of
You can start in the mid30s and in a year or two you can make
100000 to 150000 a year

From 1988 to 1991 Ramas individual tuition rose from roughly one
thousand to three thousand dollars per month He told followers
that since NPDS and ASI were actually furthering their careers
they should deduct the increasing payments from their taxes
This enabled Rama to dramatically increase his surprise gift reservoir
while bilking the IRS of millions in a way that would be difficult
to expose

In 1989 Rama justified to the disciples his rising tuition
I nearly killed myself by accepting your Negative Occult Energy
he said and now you are going to have to pay for it

In January 1990 Rama announced that disciples had until March 21
1991 to donate additional moneyfrom 50000 to 1000000 per person
depending on his or her capacity They didnt have to participate
he told them But it would be their last year in the Centre if they
did not He gave them each charmed marbles The marbles
he said would enable them to accomplish any task he suggested
The charm he added would fade for those who left the Centre
who had not already lost their marbles

At one meeting in 1990 Rama claimed that his students were treating
him with disrespect by being late with their tuition payments
Better to owe your creditors than to owe me he told them
He suggested that they move in together sleep on apartment floors
and not pay their other bills for awhile

Rama increasingly used fear tactics to control the financially hardpressed
sleep deprived followers many of whom worked more than one job
He told them that if he stopped protecting someone who left the Centre
they would suffer forever in the seventh level of hell He told
them that he wielded the power to create and demolish the universes
He told them that he was no longer the Last Incarnation of Vishnu
The Cosmic Preserver but of Siva The Cosmic Destroyer
He emphasized that those criticizing him would invariably get hit
by a car or contract cancer

Rama who had not held public lectures since early 1988 required most
students to bring at least three new potential initiates per year
He spent hours during the NPDS and ASI computer meetings coaching
disciples about what kind of people they should recruit and about
how they should go about recruiting them He also told them
of his plan to have them recruit at universities in every state
in North America

Rama came up with many new ideas between 1989 and 1991 He told
the disciples for instance that his former Guru was really a
great big spidery Entity from hell He did not mention that ten
years earlier he had billed Chinmoy as the Seventh Avatarthe
highest soul to incarnate on earth He told a few disciples
to infiltrate and destroy Microsoft Corporation one devotee
actually landed a job at the software giant as a recruiter He
told disciples that he was ordaining them as Buddhist monks
He did not mention however that he was having unprotected sex
with a substantial number of them under the guise of advancing
their souls

In 1991 articles on Rama appeared in New Yorks Newsday
The Yuppie Guru 73091 The LA Weekly Rama Rerun 112991
and in several issues of the Consultants  Contractors Newsletter
CCN I read in CCN JulyAugust 1991 issue how Ramas followers
had become known in the computer industry as the California Raisins
The Raisins apparently had been causing companies recruiters
and agencies in New York New Jersey and Connecticut to lose
a substantial amount of time and money In the same issue I read
we think it only fair to put cult members on notice that
knowledge of their activities is widespreadlocal area recruiters
are now circulating a list of those known to be cult members
which is regularly updated as new names are addedIn other words
local recruiters typically thought of as competing with one another
are acting in unison when it comes to fighting the onslaught of this
groupif you want to adhere to a certain faith or religion go ahead
its what our country was set up to protect But dont continue trying
to raise money through fraudulent behavior which neither the courts
nor most religions would condoneFurther info available from
201 2991535

Also in 1991 I read in Newsday that Rama did not permit disciples
to live near him because he did not want them to lower the vibe
of Long Island I read about one follower who committed suicide
after speaking incessantly about Rama and about making enough
money to get back into the group I read about Brenda Kerber
a follower who disappeared from her White Plains apartment on
October 9th 1989 and who at the printing of this book is still
listed as missing I read about Ramas claim that those who had
not done well in his program were simply unrealistic or lazy
And I read about Ramas claim that he merely wanted to teach
travel meditate and when time permitted date women I have
a great life Rama was quoted as saying Im one of the happier
people I know

In 1992 Rama regularly held private meetings for his computer company
monks at the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New
York at Purchase Christopher Beach director of the Performing
Arts Center told The New York Times Mentor to Some Cult Leader
to Others Westchester edition 62093 that Lenz is no more
than a Dale Carnegie of the 90s Dr Sheldon N Grebstein
president of SUNY Purchase also defended Lenz in The Times article
At SUNY Purchase we have directly witnessed none of the alleged
cult activity

From the stage of this prestigious auditorium Rama whom Grebstein
described as a model client instructed the hitech monks to fan out
to different parts of the country form front organizations and give
talks on meditation On the east coast his recruiting arms included
Boston Meditation Society Massachusetts Hartford Meditation Society
Connecticut Philadelphia Society for the Meditative Arts
eastern Pennsylvania Diamond Mind Washington DC and Maryland
New Jersey Meditative Society southern New Jersey and Princeton area
Virginia Meditative Society and Manhattan Meditation Forum New York
City and Westchester On the west coast Banzai Tantric Institute
Silicon Valley RCF San Francisco Marin County and East Bay
area and Pacific Meditation Society Los Angeles He told
disciples to promote their talks by postering universities
He told them to pay particular attention to bulletin boards around
engineering and computer science departments He told them to invite
certain seekers to meditate with him at SUNY Purchase on the east
coast and at a rented hall in Oakland California on the west
coast It was no secret what type of person Rama wanted to attract
Many of his posters found at universities across America contain
this message All workshops designed for individuals 29
and under

According to one disciple who left the group in 1993 Ramas recent
indirect recruiting method attracted roughly four hundred new disciples

When a group of disciples parentsknown as the Rama Mamas
found out about Ramas active quest for fresh material
they alerted the press Articles began to appear The Santa Fe

Ramas response to the waves of negative publicity was no different
than his response years before on The Larry King Show and A
Current Affair He professed through spokeswoman Lisa Lewinson
that moneyseeking deprogrammers were persuading former disciples
to fabricate accusations Yet the individuals whose accounts appear
in this book share their experiences as individuals These individuals
are members of no such anticult conspiracy These individuals respect
and defend the freedom to practice religion in its myriad forms
These individuals have a simple message Fly East Fly West
But dont fly into the cuckoos nest

  

Yet in the spring of 1988 stung by memories of friendship and
deceit in Ramas nest I stumbled my way past the burnedout car
abandoned on the charred foundation of 9514 La Jolla Farms Road
I let Nunatak lead me in the fading light through the parched chaparral
She gently tugged me back to the present Oneandahalf miles
east of campus I opened the door of my Volkswagon Bus I was
still crying

Inside the van I saw my fishnet bulletin board which reminded
me where I had been and where I was going On it I saw an article
about a bicycle ride I had taken two years before with Nunatak I saw
the cover of a book about Mohandas K Gandhi autographed by its author
William L Shirer I saw a brochure from the Peace Corps and a
miniature American flag I saw a sticker for UCSD John Muir College
I saw a quote from Thoreau If a man does not keep pace with
his companions perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer
Let him step to the music that he hears however measured or far away
My father sent me that

I saw a picture of anthropologistexplorer Thor Heyerdahl standing
at the bow of Ra I a papyrus reed boat which he and six others sailed
across the Atlantic The journey had proved that primitive people
could have crossed the great waterways which connect the continents
My mother sent me that

And I saw next to an inflatable globe written on a small piece
of paper the name of the chariot Sunped I a solar electrichuman
powered vehicle Below that I saw the name of the quest
Tour Del Mundo I was starting to realize that by leaving
Ramas dream I had gotten back my world

Nuna rode shotgun in the passenger seat I turned the key and
it started Leaving the mall I slowly gained momentum

Appendix B Excerpts from Ramas Tape Welcome To Lakshmi
1982


During the first year you will in effect become a new person
Even your personality structure will alterwere just trying
to cleanse your beingto just wash away those layers of maya
to teach you enough of our language so we can begin to communicate
in a more sophisticated manner spiritually

Initially the first few years were just trying to get basic
obstructions out of the way get your ideas of selfhood out of the way
just open you up to your own perfection And as we remove more and
more of these obstructions then I am able to do more and more for you

You must keep a journalof your spiritual experienceswhen
you write it down it brings it very much into the physical
consciousnessin other words it will imprint the experience
on your mind Then you should read your journal over from time
to timeYou see the mind refuses to believe a lot of what we
dobut when you bring the mind into the action of writing it down
the mind agrees and accepts these things

A large part of our program has to do with selfgiving Selfgiving
is totally important in my estimation Everything we do is predicated
upon it You can only meditate a few hours a day but you can give
of yourself constantly You should feel your whole life is nothing
but selfgivingthere is a great deal of selfgiving you can do
around the Centre which will help you Naturally whenever you give
to a spiritual organization you enter into that circle of light
and you gain much more for it than if you had just gone out
and helped one of your neighbors from a karmic point of view
The way that you can give of yourself at the Centre well there are
a few ways Naturally the most important is economically
Money is necessary in this world to run a spiritual organization
The more money we have the more people we help Its a very
simple equation




Appendix C Excerpts from Ramas Tape Sophisticated Sexuality
1983


As the years went on I found that my relationships got better
They changed though as I changedThe love became very pure and then
it was no longer painful As I went on relationships got better
and better And they meant less

I found that love and sexuality continued to be one of many
doorways that seemed to continue to help me in evolution
It just seemed to be there I had no choice in the matter
As I have no choice in anything that happens anymore

I no longer could love one person I just found that I loved everyone
Equally

Its no more special to sleep with one person than another
Whats the difference Its all a dream anyway

So I decided the best thing to do was to avoid the Watergate mentality
And to be in full disclosure Without the sense that anyone
would understand Most people and most of you are threatened
completely by your own sexuality You dont know how to deal with it
Youre terribly afraid of it And its a terrible threat to see
someone who is at ease with it

So I knew it wouldnt be easy But at the same time Ihad to be
myselfI was never particularly interested in impressing others
Otherwise I would not have been part of the Woodstock nation
I rejected society ages ago and came back to it because it seemed like
an interesting thing to do

I began to hear rumors that well I wasI dont know what I
was doingI havent listened to much of the rumors but I guess
umm I dont know that I was making love to millions of women
or something like that uhh I dont know That hasnt been the case
it might be a wonderful idea but to be quite honest I havent the time
because Im very busy its very demanding running a spiritual community
It might be a heck of a lot more fun than some of the things I do

Ive been very fortunate without one exception
all of the women I have ever met and have been involved with
have been wonderful Remarkable Absolutely remarkable
And I feel they have all been my teachers As are all of you my teachers

But I think its time everybody grew up And stop being so petty
About their own lives or other peoples lives And instead
turn their attention towards what matters money Sex is the
preoccupation of adolescence Money is the preoccupation of adults
And Lakshmi is the goddess of money

So I think its time everybody adopted a more professional
attitude about their lives In other words dont focus
so much on your relationships Have fun with them Or if you
dont have them you dont want them have fun with that
But dont bother with what other people in the Centre do so much

Sexuality I think is a little different for me than it is for
most people in that there is almost no body awareness whatsoever
Its just light

If you cant handle the fact that someday you might be enlightened
and still fall in love with people and love them and be with them
and if you cant deal with that if you hate yourself so much and hate
your sexuality so much that you think it has no light in itIf
you think it makes a difference if I have ten thousand sports cars
and ten million girlfriends and lead a very flashy life and eat
at only the most fashionable restaurants which I dont but if
that would make a difference in what we do in other words if you
can carry my lifestyle to the most absurd proportions in your mind
and that would make a difference in the meditation process then you
shouldnt work with me I dont think you should work with any teacher
Cause you dont know what its all about yet You should come
to the fashionable restaurants with us and have a good time
Cause we have a good time Cause God is in everything




Appendix D Excerpts from Ramas Advertisements and Brochures


from a fullpage spread in The New York Times

The Still Center of the Turning Worlds

There is a still center of Eternity A place where all pasts
presents and futures meet This intersecting point of knowledge
and experience pleasure and pain mortality and immortality has been
described and referred to in a variety of different ways by mystics
prophets and teachers who have experienced it

Some have described it as God or Heaven Others have referred to it
as Nirvana or Tao In Zen it is called Zen mind or Enlightenment

While names descriptions and methods for reaching the still
center of being vary greatly the ultimate worth of this awareness
is agreed upon by all who have shared it The experience of
the still center of being brings freedom selfcontrol balance
and power to those who have attuned their lives to it

Zen is the study of the Ten Thousand States of Mind and of Enlightenment
the still center which lies beyond the Ten Thousand States of Mind
It is a highly personal study which brings clarity and purpose into
the lives of those who practice it

Zen Buddhist thought has had a profound influence upon Chinese
and Japanese history and culture A great deal of the current success
of the Japanese corporate mind stems from the effect of centuries
of Zen practice in Japan Martial arts dance poetry the tea
ceremony and many other forms of personal athletic and artistic
expression have been given birth to by Zen mind

Zen is a highly refined and artistic approach to the meaning of life
It isnt necessary to learn Oriental customs or to speak the Japanese
language to successfully practice it All that is required is
an open mind patience a good sense of humor and an intense desire
for selfimprovement

I have written a free booklet about Zen for the computer age
called The Zen Experience sm In it I discuss Zen in more depth
and describe both contemporary and traditional methods I employ in
teaching Zen at seminars and in private practice

If you would like to learn more about Zen and the wonders of your
own mind call or write for this free booklet

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks
eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks

EBooks posted prior to November 2003 with eBook numbers BELOW 10000
are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year

httpwwwibiblioorggutenbergetext06

 Or etext 05 04 03 02 01 00 99
 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 92 91 or 90

EBooks posted since November 2003 with etext numbers OVER 10000 are
filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is
identical to the filename The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at

httpwwwgutenbergorg102310234

or filename 24689 would be found at
httpwwwgutenbergorg246824689
