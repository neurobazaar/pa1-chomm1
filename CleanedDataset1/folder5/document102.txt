THE TRAGEDY OF PUDDNHEAD WILSON

by Mark Twain




A WHISPER TO THE READER

 _There is no character howsoever good and fine but it can
 be destroyed by ridicule howsoever poor and witless
 Observe the ass for instance his character is about
 perfect he is the choicest spirit among all the humbler
 animals yet see what ridicule has brought him to Instead
 of feeling complimented when we are called an ass we are
 left in doubt_ Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar

A person who is ignorant of legal matters is always liable to make
mistakes when he tries to photograph a court scene with his pen and so I
was not willing to let the law chapters in this book go to press without
first subjecting them to rigid and exhausting revision and correction by
a trained barristerif that is what they are called These chapters are
right now in every detail for they were rewritten under the immediate
eye of William Hicks who studied law part of a while in southwest
Missouri thirtyfive years ago and then came over here to Florence for
his health and is still helping for exercise and board in Macaroni
Vermicellis horsefeed shed which is up the back alley as you turn
around the corner out of the Piazza del Duomo just beyond the house where
that stone that Dante used to sit on six hundred years ago is let into
the wall when he let on to be watching them build Giottos campanile and
yet always got tired looking as Beatrice passed along on her way to get a
chunk of chestnut cake to defend herself with in case of a Ghibelline
outbreak before she got to school at the same old stand where they sell
the same old cake to this day and it is just as light and good as it was
then too and this is not flattery far from it He was a little rusty
on his law but he rubbed up for this book and those two or three legal
chapters are right and straight now He told me so himself

Given under my hand this second day of January 1893 at the Villa
Viviani village of Settignano three miles back of Florence on the
hillsthe same certainly affording the most charming view to be found
on this planet and with it the most dreamlike and enchanting sunsets to
be found in any planet or even in any solar systemand given too in
the swell room of the house with the busts of Cerretani senators and
other grandees of this line looking approvingly down upon me as they
used to look down upon Dante and mutely asking me to adopt them into my
family which I do with pleasure for my remotest ancestors are but
spring chickens compared with these robed and stately antiques and it
will be a great and satisfying lift for me that six hundred years will

CHAPTER 1  Puddnhead Wins His Name

 _Tell the truth or trumpbut get the trick_ Puddnhead
 Wilsons Calendar


The scene of this chronicle is the town of Dawsons Landing on the
Missouri side of the Mississippi half a days journey per steamboat
below St Louis

In 1830 it was a snug collection of modest one and twostory frame
dwellings whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight
by climbing tangles of rose vines honeysuckles and morning glories
Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white
palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks marigolds touchmenots
princesfeathers and other oldfashioned flowers while on the
windowsills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss rose plants
and terracotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of
intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the roseclad
housefront like an explosion of flame When there was room on the ledge
outside of the pots and boxes for a cat the cat was therein sunny
weatherstretched at full length asleep and blissful with her furry
belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose Then that house was
complete and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world
by this symbol whose testimony is infallible A home without a catand
a wellfed wellpetted and properly revered catmay be a perfect
home perhaps but how can it prove title

All along the streets on both sides at the outer edge of the brick
sidewalks stood locust trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing and
these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrancer in spring when
the clusters of buds came forth The main street one block back from
the river and running parallel with it was the sole business street
It was six blocks long and in each block two or three brick stores
three stories high towered above interjected bunches of little frame
shops Swinging signs creaked in the wind the streets whole length
The candystriped pole which indicates nobility proud and ancient along
the palacebordered canals of Venice indicated merely the humble
barbershop along the main street of Dawsons Landing On a chief corner
stood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin pots
and pans and cups the chief tinmongers noisy notice to the world when
the wind blew that his shop was on hand for business at that corner

The hamlets front was washed by the clear waters of the great river its
body stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline its most rearward
border fringed itself out and scattered its houses about its base line of
the hills the hills rose high enclosing the town in a halfmoon curve
clothed with forests from foot to summit

Steamboats passed up and down every hour or so Those belonging to the
little Cairo line and the little Memphis line always stopped the big
Orleans liners stopped for hails only or to land passengers or freight
and this was the case also with the great flotilla of transients
These latter came out of a dozen riversthe Illinois the Missouri the
Upper Mississippi the Ohio the Monongahela the Tennessee the Red
River the White River and so onand were bound every whither and
stocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity which the
Mississippis communities could want from the frosty Falls of St
Anthony down through nine climates to torrid New Orleans

Dawsons Landing was a slaveholding town with a rich slaveworked grain
and pork country back of it The town was sleepy and comfortable and
contented It was fifty years old and was growing slowlyvery slowly
in fact but still it was growing

The chief citizen was York Leicester Driscoll about forty years old
judge of the county court He was very proud of his old Virginian
ancestry and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately
manners he kept up its traditions He was fine and just and generous
To be a gentlemana gentleman without stain or blemishwas his only
religion and to it he was always faithful He was respected esteemed
and beloved by all of the community He was well off and was gradually
adding to his store He and his wife were very nearly happy but not
quite for they had no children The longing for the treasure of a child
had grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away but the
blessing never cameand was never to come

With this pair lived the judges widowed sister Mrs Rachel Pratt and
she also was childlesschildless and sorrowful for that reason and not
to be comforted The women were good and commonplace people and did
their duty and had their reward in clear consciences and the communitys
approbation They were Presbyterians the judge was a freethinker

Pembroke Howard lawyer and bachelor aged almost forty was another old
Virginian grandee with proved descent from the First Families He was a
fine majestic creature a gentleman according to the nicest requirements
of the Virginia rule a devoted Presbyterian an authority on the code
and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you in the field if
any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you and
explain it with any weapon you might prefer from bradawls to artillery
He was very popular with the people and was the judges dearest friend

Then there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex another FFV of formidable
caliberhowever with him we have no concern

Percy Northumberland Driscoll brother to the judge and younger than he
by five years was a married man and had had children around his
hearthstone but they were attacked in detail by measles croup and
scarlet fever and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective
antediluvian methods so the cradles were empty He was a prosperous
man with a good head for speculations and his fortune was growing On
the first of February 1830 two boy babes were born in his house one to
him one to one of his slave girls Roxana by name Roxana was twenty
years old She was up and around the same day with her hands full for
she was tending both babes

Mrs Percy Driscoll died within the week Roxy remained in charge of the
children She had her own way for Mr Driscoll soon absorbed himself in
his speculations and left her to her own devices

In that same month of February Dawsons Landing gained a new citizen
This was Mr David Wilson a young fellow of Scotch parentage He had
wandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of the
State of New York to seek his fortune He was twentyfive years old
college bred and had finished a postcollege course in an Eastern law
school a couple of years before

He was a homely freckled sandyhaired young fellow with an intelligent
blue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a covert twinkle of
a pleasant sort But for an unfortunate remark of his he would no doubt
have entered at once upon a successful career at Dawsons Landing But he
made his fatal remark the first day he spent in the village and it
gaged him He had just made the acquaintance of a group of citizens
when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl and make himself
very comprehensively disagreeable whereupon young Wilson said much as
one who is thinking aloud

I wish I owned half of that dog

Why somebody asked

Because I would kill my half

The group searched his face with curiosity with anxiety even but found
no light there no expression that they could read They fell away from
him as from something uncanny and went into privacy to discuss him One
said

Pears to be a fool

Pears said another _Is_ I reckon you better say

Said he wished he owned _half_ of the dog the idiot said a third
What did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his half
Do you reckon he thought it would live

Why he must have thought it unless he IS the downrightest fool in the
world because if he hadnt thought it he would have wanted to own the
whole dog knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died he
would be responsible for that half just the same as if he had killed that
half instead of his own Dont it look that way to you gents

Yes it does If he owned one half of the general dog it would be so
if he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end it
would be so just the same particularly in the first case because if
you kill one half of a general dog there aint any man that can tell
whose half it was but if he owned one end of the dog maybe he could
kill his end of it and

No he couldnt either he couldnt and not be responsible if the other
end died which it would In my opinion that man aint in his right
mind

In my opinion he haint _got_ any mind

No 3 said Well hes a lummox anyway

Thats what he is said No 4 Hes a labrickjust a Simonpure
labrick if there was one

Yes sir hes a dam fool Thats the way I put him up said No 5
Anybody can think different that wants to but those are my sentiments

Im with you gentlemen said No 6 Perfect jackassyes and it
aint going too far to say he is a puddnhead If he aint a puddnhead
I aint no judge thats all

Mr Wilson stood elected The incident was told all over the town and
gravely discussed by everybody Within a week he had lost his first
name Puddnhead took its place In time he came to be liked and well
liked too but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on and it
stayed That first days verdict made him a fool and he was not able to
get it set aside or even modified The nickname soon ceased to carry
any harsh or unfriendly feeling with it but it held its place and was
to continue to hold its place for twenty long years




CHAPTER 2  Driscoll Spares His Slaves

 _Adam was but humanthis explains it all He did not want
 the apple for the apples sake he wanted it only because it
 was forbidden The mistake was in not forbidding the
 serpent then he would have eaten the serpent_ Puddnhead
 Wilsons Calendar


Puddnhead Wilson had a trifle of money when he arrived and he bought a
small house on the extreme western verge of the town Between it and
Judge Driscolls house there was only a grassy yard with a paling fence
dividing the properties in the middle He hired a small office down in
the town and hung out a tin sign with these words on it

D A V I D W I L S O N

ATTORNEY AND COUNSELORATLAW

SURVEYING CONVEYANCING ETC

But his deadly remark had ruined his chanceat least in the law No
clients came He took down his sign after a while and put it up on his
own house with the law features knocked out of it It offered his
services now in the humble capacities of land surveyor and expert
accountant Now and then he got a job of surveying to do and now and
then a merchant got him to straighten out his books With Scotch patience
and pluck he resolved to live down his reputation and work his way into
the legal field yet Poor fellow he could foresee that it was going to
take him such a weary long time to do it

He had a rich abundance of idle time but it never hung heavy on his
hands for he interested himself in every new thing that was born into
the universe of ideas and studied it and experimented upon it at his
house One of his pet fads was palmistry To another one he gave no
name neither would he explain to anybody what its purpose was but
merely said it was an amusement In fact he had found that his fads
added to his reputation as a puddnhead there he was growing chary of
being too communicative about them The fad without a name was one which
dealt with peoples finger marks He carried in his coat pocket a
shallow box with grooves in it and in the grooves strips of glass five
inches long and three inches wide Along the lower edge of each strip
was pasted a slip of white paper He asked people to pass their hands
through their hair thus collecting upon them a thin coating of the
natural oil and then making a thumbmark on a glass strip following it
with the mark of the ball of each finger in succession Under this row
of faint grease prints he would write a record on the strip of white
paperthus

JOHN SMITH right hand

and add the day of the month and the year then take Smiths left hand on
another glass strip and add name and date and the words left hand The
strips were now returned to the grooved box and took their place among
what Wilson called his records

He often studied his records examining and poring over them with
absorbing interest until far into the night but what he found thereif
he found anythinghe revealed to no one Sometimes he copied on paper
the involved and delicate pattern left by the ball of the finger and
then vastly enlarged it with a pantograph so that he could examine its
web of curving lines with ease and convenience

One sweltering afternoonit was the first day of July 1830he was at
work over a set of tangled account books in his workroom which looked
westward over a stretch of vacant lots when a conversation outside
disturbed him It was carried on in yells which showed that the people
engaged in it were not close together

Say Roxy how does yo baby come on This from the distant voice

Fustrate How does _you_ come on Jasper This yell was from close
by

Oh Is middlin haint got nothn to complain of Is gwine to come
acourtn you bimeby Roxy

_You_ is you black mud cat Yahyahyah I got somepn better to
do den sociatn wid niggers as black as you is Is ole Miss Coopers
Nancy done give you de mitten Roxy followed this sally with another
discharge of carefree laughter

Yous jealous Roxy dats whats de matter wid you you
hussyyahyahyah Dats de time I got you

Oh yes _you_ got me haint you Clah to goodness if dat conceit o
yon strikes in Jasper it gwine to kill you sho If you blonged to
me Id sell you down de river fo you git too fur gone Fust time I
runs acrost yo marster Is gwine to tell him so

This idle and aimless jabber went on and on both parties enjoying the
friendly duel and each well satisfied with his own share of the wit
exchangedfor wit they considered it

Wilson stepped to the window to observe the combatants he could not work
while their chatter continued Over in the vacant lots was Jasper
young coal black and of magnificent build sitting on a wheelbarrow in
the pelting sunat work supposably whereas he was in fact only
preparing for it by taking an hours rest before beginning In front of
Wilsons porch stood Roxy with a local handmade baby wagon in which sat
her two chargesone at each end and facing each other From Roxys
manner of speech a stranger would have expected her to be black but she
was not Only one sixteenth of her was black and that sixteenth did not
show She was of majestic form and stature her attitudes were imposing
and statuesque and her gestures and movements distinguished by a noble
and stately grace Her complexion was very fair with the rosy glow of
vigorous health in her cheeks her face was full of character and
expression her eyes were brown and liquid and she had a heavy suit of
fine soft hair which was also brown but the fact was not apparent
because her head was bound about with a checkered handkerchief and the
hair was concealed under it Her face was shapely intelligent and
comelyeven beautiful She had an easy independent carriagewhen she
was among her own casteand a high and sassy way withal but of
course she was meek and humble enough where white people were

To all intents and purposes Roxy was as white as anybody but the one
sixteenth of her which was black outvoted the other fifteen parts and
made her a Negro She was a slave and salable as such Her child was
thirtyone parts white and he too was a slave and by a fiction of law
and custom a Negro He had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white
comrade but even the father of the white child was able to tell the
children apartlittle as he had commerce with themby their clothes
for the white babe wore ruffled soft muslin and a coral necklace while
the other wore merely a coarse towlinen shirt which barely reached to
its knees and no jewelry

The white childs name was Thomas a Becket Driscoll the others name was
Valet de Chambre no surnameslaves hadnt the privilege Roxana had
heard that phrase somewhere the fine sound of it had pleased her ear
and as she had supposed it was a name she loaded it on to her darling
It soon got shorted to Chambers of course

Wilson knew Roxy by sight and when the duel of wits begun to play out
he stepped outside to gather in a record or two Jasper went to work
energetically at once perceiving that his leisure was observed Wilson
inspected the children and asked

How old are they Roxy

Bofe de same age sirfive months Bawn de fust o Febuary

Theyre handsome little chaps Ones just as handsome as the other
too

A delighted smile exposed the girls white teeth and she said

Bless yo soul Misto Wilson its powful nice o you to say dat
case one of em aint ony a nigger Mighty prime little nigger _I_
alays says but dats case its mine o course

How do you tell them apart Roxy when they havent any clothes on

Roxy laughed a laugh proportioned to her size and said

Oh _I_ kin tell em part Misto Wilson but I bet Marse Percy
couldnt not to save his life

Wilson chatted along for awhile and presently got Roxys fingerprints
for his collectionright hand and lefton a couple of his glass strips
then labeled and dated them and took the records of both children and
labeled and dated them also

Two months later on the third of September he took this trio of finger
marks again He liked to have a series two or three takings at
intervals during the period of childhood these to be followed at
intervals of several years

The next daythat is to say on the fourth of Septembersomething
occurred which profoundly impressed Roxana Mr Driscoll missed another
small sum of moneywhich is a way of saying that this was not a new
thing but had happened before In truth it had happened three times
before Driscolls patience was exhausted He was a fairly humane man
toward slaves and other animals he was an exceedingly humane man toward
the erring of his own race Theft he could not abide and plainly there
was a thief in his house Necessarily the thief must be one of his
Negros Sharp measures must be taken He called his servants before him
There were three of these besides Roxy a man a woman and a boy
twelve years old They were not related Mr Driscoll said

You have all been warned before It has done no good This time I will
teach you a lesson I will sell the thief Which of you is the guilty
one

They all shuddered at the threat for here they had a good home and a
new one was likely to be a change for the worse The denial was general
None had stolen anythingnot money anywaya little sugar or cake or
honey or something like that that Marse Percy wouldnt mind or miss
but not moneynever a cent of money They were eloquent in their
protestations but Mr Driscoll was not moved by them He answered each
in turn with a stern Name the thief

The truth was all were guilty but Roxana she suspected that the others
were guilty but she did not know them to be so She was horrified to
think how near she had come to being guilty herself she had been saved
in the nick of time by a revival in the colored Methodist Church a
fortnight before at which time and place she got religion The very
next day after that gracious experience while her change of style was
fresh upon her and she was vain of her purified condition her master
left a couple dollars unprotected on his desk and she happened upon that
temptation when she was polishing around with a dustrag She looked at
the money awhile with a steady rising resentment then she burst out
with

Dad blame dat revival I wisht it had a ben put off till tomorrow

Then she covered the tempter with a book and another member of the
kitchen cabinet got it She made this sacrifice as a matter of religious
etiquette as a thing necessary just now but by no means to be wrested
into a precedent no a week or two would limber up her piety then she
would be rational again and the next two dollars that got left out in
the cold would find a comforterand she could name the comforter

Was she bad Was she worse than the general run of her race No They
had an unfair show in the battle of life and they held it no sin to take
military advantage of the enemyin a small way in a small way but not
in a large one They would smouch provisions from the pantry whenever
they got a chance or a brass thimble or a cake of wax or an emery bag
or a paper of needles or a silver spoon or a dollar bill or small
articles of clothing or any other property of light value and so far
were they from considering such reprisals sinful that they would go to
church and shout and pray the loudest and sincerest with their plunder in
their pockets A farm smokehouse had to be kept heavily padlocked or
even the colored deacon himself could not resist a ham when Providence
showed him in a dream or otherwise where such a thing hung lonesome
and longed for someone to love But with a hundred hanging before him
the deacon would not take twothat is on the same night On frosty
nights the humane Negro prowler would warm the end of the plank and put
it up under the cold claws of chickens roosting in a tree a drowsy hen
would step on to the comfortable board softly clucking her gratitude
and the prowler would dump her into his bag and later into his stomach
perfectly sure that in taking this trifle from the man who daily robbed
him of an inestimable treasurehis libertyhe was not committing any
sin that God would remember against him in the Last Great Day

Name the thief

For the fourth time Mr Driscoll had said it and always in the same hard
tone And now he added these words of awful import

I give you one minute He took out his watch If at the end of that
time you have not confessed I will not only sell all four of you
BUTI will sell you DOWN THE RIVER

It was equivalent to condemning them to hell No Missouri Negro doubted
this Roxy reeled in her tracks and the color vanished out of her face
the others dropped to their knees as if they had been shot tears gushed
from their eyes their supplicating hands went up and three answers came
in the one instant

I done it

I done it

I done ithave mercy marsterLord have mercy on us po niggers

Very good said the master putting up his watch I will sell you
_here_ though you dont deserve it You ought to be sold down the
river

The culprits flung themselves prone in an ecstasy of gratitude and
kissed his feet declaring that they would never forget his goodness and
never cease to pray for him as long as they lived They were sincere for
like a god he had stretched forth his mighty hand and closed the gates of
hell against them He knew himself that he had done a noble and
gracious thing and was privately well pleased with his magnanimity and
that night he set the incident down in his diary so that his son might
read it in after years and be thereby moved to deeds of gentleness and
humanity himself




CHAPTER 3  Roxy Plays a Shrewd Trick

 _Whoever has lived long enough to find out what life is
 knows how deep a debt of gratitude we owe to Adam the first
 great benefactor of our race He brought death into the
 world_ Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


Percy Driscoll slept well the night he saved his house minions from
going down the river but no wink of sleep visited Roxys eyes A
profound terror had taken possession of her Her child could grow up and
be sold down the river The thought crazed her with horror If she dozed
and lost herself for a moment the next moment she was on her feet flying
to her childs cradle to see if it was still there Then she would gather
it to her heart and pour out her love upon it in a frenzy of kisses
moaning crying and saying Dey shant oh dey _shant_yo po
mammy will kill you fust

Once when she was tucking him back in its cradle again the other child
nestled in its sleep and attracted her attention She went and stood
over it a long time communing with herself

What has my po baby done dat he couldnt have yo luck He haint done
nuthn God was good to you why warnt he good to him Dey cant sell
_you_ down de river I hates yo pappy he haint got no heartfor
niggers he haint anyways I hates him en I could kill him She
paused awhile thinking then she burst into wild sobbings again and
turned away saying Oh I got to kill my chile dey aint no yuther
waykillin _him_ wouldnt save de chile fum goin down de river Oh I
got to do it yo po mammys got to kill you to save you honey She
gathered her baby to her bosom now and began to smother it with
caresses Mammys got to kill youhow _kin_ I do it But yo mammy
aint gwine to desert youno no _dah_ dont cryshe gwine _wid_
you she gwine to kill herself too Come along honey come along wid
mammy we gwine to jump in de river den troubles o dis worl is all
overdey dont sell po niggers down the river over _yonder_

She stared toward the door crooning to the child and hushing it midway
she stopped suddenly She had caught sight of her new Sunday gowna
cheap curtaincalico thing a conflagration of gaudy colors and fantastic
figures She surveyed it wistfully longingly

Haint ever wore it yet she said en its just lovely Then she
nodded her head in response to a pleasant idea and added No I aint
gwine to be fished out wid everybody lookin at me in dis misable ole
linseywoolsey

She put down the child and made the change She looked in the glass and
was astonished at her beauty She resolved to make her death toilet
perfect She took off her handkerchief turban and dressed her glossy
wealth of hair like white folks she added some odds and ends of rather
lurid ribbon and a spray of atrocious artificial flowers finally she
threw over her shoulders a fluffy thing called a cloud in that day
which was of a blazing red complexion Then she was ready for the tomb

She gathered up her baby once more but when her eye fell upon its
miserably short little gray towlinen shirt and noted the contrast
between its pauper shabbiness and her own volcanic eruption of infernal
splendors her motherheart was touched and she was ashamed

No dolling mammy aint gwine to treat you so De angels is gwine to
mire you jist as much as dey does yo mammy Aint gwine to have em
puttn dey hans up fo dey eyes en sayin to David and Goliah en dem
yuther prophets Dat chile is dress to indelicate fo dis place

By this time she had stripped off the shirt Now she clothed the naked
little creature in one of Thomas a Beckets snowy long baby gowns with
its bright blue bows and dainty flummery of ruffles

Dahnow yous fixed She propped the child in a chair and stood off
to inspect it Straightway her eyes begun to widen with astonishment and
admiration and she clapped her hands and cried out Why it do beat
all I _never_ knowed you was so lovely Marse Tommy aint a bit
puttiernot a single bit

She stepped over and glanced at the other infant she flung a glance
back at her own then one more at the heir of the house Now a strange
light dawned in her eyes and in a moment she was lost in thought She
seemed in a trance when she came out of it she muttered When I uz
awashin em in de tub yistiddy he own pappy asked me which of em was
hisn

She began to move around like one in a dream She undressed Thomas a
Becket stripping him of everything and put the towlinen shirt on him
She put his coral necklace on her own childs neck Then she placed the
children side by side and after earnest inspection she muttered

Now who would blieve cloes could do de like o dat Dog my cats if it
aint all _I_ kin do to tell t other fum which let alone his pappy

She put her cub in Tommys elegant cradle and said

Yous young Marse _Tom_ fum dis out en I got to practice and git used
to memberin to call you dat honey or Is gwine to make a mistake
sometime en git us bofe into trouble Dahnow you lay still en dont
fret no mo Marse Tom Oh thank de lord in heaven yous saved yous
saved Dey aint no man kin ever sell mammys po little honey down de
river now

She put the heir of the house in her own childs unpainted pine cradle
and said contemplating its slumbering form uneasily

Is sorry for you honey Is sorry God knows I isbut what _kin_ I
do what _could_ I do Yo pappy would sell him to somebody sometime
en den hed go down de river sho en I couldnt couldnt _couldnt_
stan it

She flung herself on her bed and began to think and toss toss and think
By and by she sat suddenly upright for a comforting thought had flown
through her worried mind

T aint no sin_white_ folks has done it It aint no sin glory to
goodness it aint no sin _Deys_ done ityes en dey was de biggest
quality in de whole bilin too_kings_

She began to muse she was trying to gather out of her memory the dim
particulars of some tale she had heard some time or other At last she
said

Now Is got it now I member It was dat ole nigger preacher dat tole
it de time he come over here fum Illinois en preached in de nigger
church He said dey aint nobody kin save his own selfcant do it by
faith cant do it by works cant do it no way at all Free grace is de
_ony_ way en dat dont come fum nobody but jis de Lord en _he_ kin
give it to anybody He please saint or sinner_he_ dont kyer He do
jis as Hes a mineter He slect out anybody dat suit Him en put
another one in his place and make de fust one happy forever en leave t
other one to burn wid Satan De preacher said it was jist like dey done
in Englan one time long time ago De queen she lef her baby layin
aroun one day en went out callin an one o de niggers rounbout de
place dat was mos white she come in en see de chile layin aroun en
tuck en put her own chiles clos on de queens chile en put de queens
chiles cloes on her own chile en den lef her own chile layin aroun
en tuck en toted de queens chile home to de nigger quarter en nobody
ever foun it out en her chile was de king bimeby en sole de queens
chile down de river one time when dey had to settle up de estate Dah
nowde preacher said it his own self en it aint no sin case white
folks done it DEY done ityes DEY done it en not ony jis common
white folks nuther but de biggest quality dey is in de whole bilin
_Oh_ Is _so_ glad I member bout dat

She got lighthearted and happy and went to the cradles and spent what
was left of the night practicing She would give her own child a light
pat and say humbly Lay still Marse Tom then give the real Tom a pat
and say with severity Lay _still_ Chambers Does you want me to take
somepn _to_ you

As she progressed with her practice she was surprised to see how
steadily and surely the awe which had kept her tongue reverent and her
manner humble toward her young master was transferring itself to her
speech and manner toward the usurper and how similarly handy she was
becoming in transferring her motherly curtness of speech and
peremptoriness of manner to the unlucky heir of the ancient house of
Driscoll

The new Negros gave Roxy no trouble of course The master gave her
none for one of his speculations was in jeopardy and his mind was so
occupied that he hardly saw the children when he looked at them and all
Roxy had to do was to get them both into a gale of laughter when he came
about then their faces were mainly cavities exposing gums and he was
gone again before the spasm passed and the little creatures resumed a
human aspect

Within a few days the fate of the speculation became so dubious that Mr
Percy went away with his brother the judge to see what could be done
with it It was a land speculation as usual and it had gotten
complicated with a lawsuit The men were gone seven weeks Before they
got back Roxy had paid her visit to Wilson and was satisfied Wilson
took the fingerprints labeled them with the names and with the date
October the firstput them carefully away and continued his chat with
Roxy who seemed very anxious that he should admire the great advance in
flesh and beauty which the babes had made since he took their
fingerprints a month before He complimented their improvement to her
contentment and as they were without any disguise of jam or other stain
she trembled all the while and was miserably frightened lest at any
moment he

But he didnt He discovered nothing and she went home jubilant and
dropped all concern about the matter permanently out of her mind




CHAPTER 4  The Ways of the Changelings

 _Adam and Eve had many advantages but the principal one
 was that they escaped teething_ Puddnhead Wilsons
 Calendar

 _There is this trouble about special providencesnamely
 there is so often a doubt as to which party was intended to
 be the beneficiary In the case of the children the bears
 and the prophet the bears got more real satisfaction out of
 the episode than the prophet did because they got the
 children_ Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


This history must henceforth accommodate itself to the change which
Roxana has consummated and call the real heir Chambers and the
usurping little slave Thomas a Becketshortening this latter name to
Tom for daily use as the people about him did

Tom was a bad baby from the very beginning of his usurpation He would
cry for nothing he would burst into storms of devilish temper without
notice and let go scream after scream and squall after squall then
climax the thing with holding his breaththat frightful specialty of
the teething nursling in the throes of which the creature exhausts its
lungs then is convulsed with noiseless squirmings and twistings and
kickings in the effort to get its breath while the lips turn blue and
the mouth stands wide and rigid offering for inspection one wee tooth
set in the lower rim of a hoop of red gums and when the appalling
stillness has endured until one is sure the lost breath will never
return a nurse comes flying and dashes water in the childs face
andpresto the lungs fill and instantly discharge a shriek or a yell
or a howl which bursts the listening ear and surprises the owner of it
into saying words which would not go well with a halo if he had one The
baby Tom would claw anybody who came within reach of his nails and pound
anybody he could reach with his rattle He would scream for water until
he got it and then throw cup and all on the floor and scream for more
He was indulged in all his caprices howsoever troublesome and
exasperating they might be he was allowed to eat anything he wanted
particularly things that would give him the stomachache

When he got to be old enough to begin to toddle about and say broken
words and get an idea of what his hands were for he was a more
consummate pest than ever Roxy got no rest while he was awake He would
call for anything and everything he saw simply saying Awnt it want
it which was a command When it was brought he said in a frenzy and
motioning it away with his hands Dont awnt it dont awnt it and the
moment it was gone he set up frantic yells of Awnt it awnt it and
Roxy had to give wings to her heels to get that thing back to him again
before he could get time to carry out his intention of going into
convulsions about it

What he preferred above all other things was the tongs This was because
his father had forbidden him to have them lest he break windows and
furniture with them The moment Roxys back was turned he would toddle
to the presence of the tongs and say Like it and cock his eye to one
side or see if Roxy was observed then Awnt it and cock his eye
again then Hab it with another furtive glance and finally Take
itand the prize was his The next moment the heavy implement was
raised aloft the next there was a crash and a squall and the cat was
off on three legs to meet an engagement Roxy would arrive just as the
lamp or a window went to irremediable smash

Tom got all the petting Chambers got none Tom got all the delicacies
Chambers got mush and milk and clabber without sugar In consequence
Tom was a sickly child and Chambers wasnt Tom was fractious as Roxy
called it and overbearing Chambers was meek and docile

With all her splendid common sense and practical everyday ability Roxy
was a doting fool of a mother She was this toward her childand she
was also more than this by the fiction created by herself he was
become her master the necessity of recognizing this relation outwardly
and of perfecting herself in the forms required to express the
recognition had moved her to such diligence and faithfulness in
practicing these forms that this exercise soon concreted itself into
habit it became automatic and unconscious then a natural result
followed deceptions intended solely for others gradually grew
practically into selfdeceptions as well the mock reverence became real
reverence the mock homage real homage the little counterfeit rift of
separation between imitationslave and imitationmaster widened and
widened and became an abyss and a very real oneand on one side of it
stood Roxy the dupe of her own deceptions and on the other stood her
child no longer a usurper to her but her accepted and recognized
master He was her darling her master and her deity all in one and in
her worship of him she forgot who she was and what he had been

In babyhood Tom cuffed and banged and scratched Chambers unrebuked and
Chambers early learned that between meekly bearing it and resenting it
the advantage all lay with the former policy The few times that his
persecutions had moved him beyond control and made him fight back had
cost him very dear at headquarters not at the hands of Roxy for if she
ever went beyond scolding him sharply for forgettn who his young
marster was she at least never extended her punishment beyond a box on
the ear No Percy Driscoll was the person He told Chambers that under
no provocation whatever was he privileged to lift his hand against his
little master Chambers overstepped the line three times and got three
such convincing canings from the man who was his father and didnt know
it that he took Toms cruelties in all humility after that and made no
more experiments

Outside the house the two boys were together all through their boyhood
Chambers was strong beyond his years and a good fighter strong because
he was coarsely fed and hard worked about the house and a good fighter
because Tom furnished him plenty of practiceon white boys whom he
hated and was afraid of Chambers was his constant bodyguard to and
from school he was present on the playground at recess to protect his
charge He fought himself into such a formidable reputation by and by
that Tom could have changed clothes with him and ridden in peace like
Sir Kay in Launcelots armor

He was good at games of skill too Tom staked him with marbles to play
keeps with and then took all the winnings away from him In the winter
season Chambers was on hand in Toms wornout clothes with holy red
mittens and holy shoes and pants holy at the knees and seat to
drag a sled up the hill for Tom warmly clad to ride down on but he
never got a ride himself He built snowmen and snow fortifications under
Toms directions He was Toms patient target when Tom wanted to do some
snowballing but the target couldnt fire back Chambers carried Toms
skates to the river and strapped them on him then trotted around after
him on the ice so as to be on hand when he wanted but he wasnt ever
asked to try the skates himself

In summer the pet pastime of the boys of Dawsons Landing was to steal
apples peaches and melons from the farmers fruit wagonsmainly on
account of the risk they ran of getting their heads laid open with the
butt of the farmers whip Tom was a distinguished adept at these
theftsby proxy Chambers did his stealing and got the peach stones
apple cores and melon rinds for his share

Tom always made Chambers go in swimming with him and stay by him as a
protection When Tom had had enough he would slip out and tie knots in
Chambers shirt dip the knots in the water and make them hard to undo
then dress himself and sit by and laugh while the naked shiverer tugged
at the stubborn knots with his teeth

Tom did his humble comrade these various ill turns partly out of native
viciousness and partly because he hated him for his superiorities of
physique and pluck and for his manifold cleverness Tom couldnt dive
for it gave him splitting headaches Chambers could dive without
inconvenience and was fond of doing it He excited so much admiration
one day among a crowd of white boys by throwing back somersaults from
the stern of a canoe that it wearied Toms spirit and at last he shoved
the canoe underneath Chambers while he was in the airso he came down on
his head in the canoe bottom and while he lay unconscious several of
Toms ancient adversaries saw that their longdesired opportunity was
come and they gave the false heir such a drubbing that with Chambers
best help he was hardly able to drag himself home afterward

When the boys was fifteen and upward Tom was showing off in the river
one day when he was taken with a cramp and shouted for help It was a
common trick with the boysparticularly if a stranger was presentto
pretend a cramp and howl for help then when the stranger came tearing
hand over hand to the rescue the howler would go on struggling and
howling till he was close at hand then replace the howl with a sarcastic
smile and swim blandly away while the town boys assailed the dupe with a
volley of jeers and laughter Tom had never tried this joke as yet but
was supposed to be trying it now so the boys held warily back but
Chambers believed his master was in earnest therefore he swam out and
arrived in time unfortunately and saved his life

This was the last feather Tom had managed to endure everything else
but to have to remain publicly and permanently under such an obligation
as this to a nigger and to this nigger of all niggersthis was too
much He heaped insults upon Chambers for pretending to think he was in
earnest in calling for help and said that anybody but a blockheaded
nigger would have known he was funning and left him alone

Toms enemies were in strong force here so they came out with their
opinions quite freely They laughed at him and called him coward liar
sneak and other sorts of pet names and told him they meant to call
Chambers by a new name after this and make it common in the townTom
Driscolls nigger pappyto signify that he had had a second birth into
this life and that Chambers was the author of his new being Tom grew
frantic under these taunts and shouted

Knock their heads off Chambers Knock their heads off What do you
stand there with your hands in your pockets for

Chambers expostulated and said But Marse Tom deys too many of
emdeys

Do you hear me

Please Marse Tom dont make me Deys so many of em dat

Tom sprang at him and drove his pocketknife into him two or three times
before the boys could snatch him away and give the wounded lad a chance
to escape He was considerably hurt but not seriously If the blade had
been a little longer his career would have ended there

Tom had long ago taught Roxy her place It had been many a day now
since she had ventured a caress or a fondling epithet in his quarter
Such things from a nigger were repulsive to him and she had been
warned to keep her distance and remember who she was She saw her
darling gradually cease from being her son she saw THAT detail perish
utterly all that was left was mastermaster pure and simple and it
was not a gentle mastership either She saw herself sink from the
sublime height of motherhood to the somber depths of unmodified slavery
the abyss of separation between her and her boy was complete She was
merely his chattel now his convenience his dog his cringing and
helpless slave the humble and unresisting victim of his capricious
temper and vicious nature

Sometimes she could not go to sleep even when worn out with fatigue
because her rage boiled so high over the days experiences with her boy
She would mumble and mutter to herself

He struck me en I warnt no way to blamestruck me in de face right
before folks En hes alays callin me nigger wench en hussy en all
dem mean names when Is doin de very bes I kin Oh Lord I done so
much for himI lif him away up to what he isen dis is what I git for
it

Sometimes when some outrage of peculiar offensiveness stung her to the
heart she would plan schemes of vengeance and revel in the fancied
spectacle of his exposure to the world as an imposter and a slave but in
the midst of these joys fear would strike her she had made him too
strong she could prove nothing andheavens she might get sold down
the river for her pains So her schemes always went for nothing and she
laid them aside in impotent rage against the fates and against herself
for playing the fool on that fatal September day in not providing herself
with a witness for use in the day when such a thing might be needed for
the appeasing of her vengeancehungry heart

And yet the moment Tom happened to be good to her and kindand this
occurred every now and thenall her sore places were healed and she was
happy happy and proud for this was her son her nigger son lording it
among the whites and securely avenging their crimes against her race

There were two grand funerals in Dawsons Landing that fallthe fall of
1845 One was that of Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex the other that of
Percy Driscoll

On his deathbed Driscoll set Roxy free and delivered his idolized
ostensible son solemnly into the keeping of his brother the judge and
his wife Those childless people were glad to get him Childless people
are not difficult to please

Judge Driscoll had gone privately to his brother a month before and
bought Chambers He had heard that Tom had been trying to get his father
to sell the boy down the river and he wanted to prevent the scandalfor
public sentiment did not approve of that way of treating family servants
for light cause or for no cause

Percy Driscoll had worn himself out in trying to save his great
speculative landed estate and had died without succeeding He was hardly
in his grave before the boom collapsed and left his envied young devil of
an heir a pauper But that was nothing his uncle told him he should be
his heir and have all his fortune when he died so Tom was comforted

Roxy had no home now so she resolved to go around and say goodby to her
friends and then clear out and see the worldthat is to say she would
go chambermaiding on a steamboat the darling ambition of her race and
sex

Her last call was on the black giant Jasper She found him chopping
Puddnhead Wilsons winter provision of wood

Wilson was chatting with him when Roxy arrived He asked her how she
could bear to go off chambermaiding and leave her boys and chaffingly
offered to copy off a series of their fingerprints reaching up to their
twelfth year for her to remember them by but she sobered in a moment
wondering if he suspected anything then she said she believed she didnt
want them Wilson said to himself The drop of black blood in her is
superstitious she thinks theres some devilry some witch business about
my glass mystery somewhere she used to come here with an old horseshoe
in her hand it could have been an accident but I doubt it

Mrs York Driscoll enjoyed two years of bliss with that prize
Tombliss that was troubled a little at times it is true but bliss
nevertheless then she died and her husband and his childless sister
Mrs Pratt continued this blissbusiness at the old stand Tom was
petted and indulged and spoiled to his entire contentor nearly that
This went on till he was nineteen then he was sent to Yale He went
handsomely equipped with conditions but otherwise he was not an object
of distinction there He remained at Yale two years and then threw up
the struggle He came home with his manners a good deal improved he had
lost his surliness and brusqueness and was rather pleasantly soft and
smooth now he was furtively and sometimes openly ironical of speech
and given to gently touching people on the raw but he did it with a
goodnatured semiconscious air that carried it off safely and kept him
from getting into trouble He was as indolent as ever and showed no very
strenuous desire to hunt up an occupation People argued from this that
he preferred to be supported by his uncle until his uncles shoes should
become vacant He brought back one or two new habits with him one of
which he rather openly practicedtipplingbut concealed another which
was gambling It would not do to gamble where his uncle could hear of
it he knew that quite well

Toms Eastern polish was not popular among the young people They could
have endured it perhaps if Tom had stopped there but he wore gloves
and that they couldnt stand and wouldnt so he was mainly without
society He brought home with him a suit of clothes of such exquisite
style and cut in fashionEastern fashion city fashionthat it filled
everybody with anguish and was regarded as a peculiarly wanton affront
He enjoyed the feeling which he was exciting and paraded the town serene
and happy all day but the young fellows set a tailor to work that night
and when Tom started out on his parade next morning he found the old
deformed Negro bell ringer straddling along in his wake tricked out in a
flamboyant curtaincalico exaggeration of his finery and imitating his
fancy Eastern graces as well as he could

Tom surrendered and after that clothed himself in the local fashion But
the dull country town was tiresome to him since his acquaintanceship
with livelier regions and it grew daily more and more so He began to
make little trips to St Louis for refreshment There he found
companionship to suit him and pleasures to his taste along with more
freedom in some particulars than he could have at home So during the
next two years his visits to the city grew in frequency and his
tarryings there grew steadily longer in duration

He was getting into deep waters He was taking chances privately which
might get him into trouble some dayin fact _did_

Judge Driscoll had retired from the bench and from all business
activities in 1850 and had now been comfortably idle three years He was
president of the Freethinkers Society and Puddnhead Wilson was the
other member The societys weekly discussions were now the old lawyers
main interest in life Puddnhead was still toiling in obscurity at the
bottom of the ladder under the blight of that unlucky remark which he
had let fall twentythree years before about the dog

Judge Driscoll was his friend and claimed that he had a mind above the
average but that was regarded as one of the judges whims and it failed
to modify the public opinion Or rather that was one of the reasons why
it failed but there was another and better one If the judge had stopped
with bare assertion it would have had a good deal of effect but he made
the mistake of trying to prove his position For some years Wilson had
been privately at work on a whimsical almanac for his amusementa
calendar with a little dab of ostensible philosophy usually in ironical
form appended to each date and the judge thought that these quips and
fancies of Wilsons were neatly turned and cute so he carried a handful
of them around one day and read them to some of the chief citizens But
irony was not for those people their mental vision was not focused for
it They read those playful trifles in the solidest terms and decided
without hesitancy that if there had ever been any doubt that Dave Wilson
was a puddnheadwhich there hadntthis revelation removed that doubt
for good and all That is just the way in this world an enemy can partly
ruin a man but it takes a goodnatured injudicious friend to complete
the thing and make it perfect After this the judge felt tenderer than
ever toward Wilson and surer than ever that his calendar had merit

Judge Driscoll could be a freethinker and still hold his place in society
because he was the person of most consequence to the community and
therefore could venture to go his own way and follow out his own notions
The other member of his pet organization was allowed the like liberty
because he was a cipher in the estimation of the public and nobody
attached any importance to what he thought or did He was liked he was
welcome enough all around but he simply didnt count for anything

The Widow Cooperaffectionately called Aunt Patsy by everybodylived
in a snug and comely cottage with her daughter Rowena who was nineteen
romantic amiable and very pretty but otherwise of no consequence
Rowena had a couple of young brothersalso of no consequence

The widow had a large spare room which she let to a lodger with board
when she could find one but this room had been empty for a year now to
her sorrow Her income was only sufficient for the family support and
she needed the lodging money for trifling luxuries But now at last on
a flaming June day she found herself happy her tedious wait was ended
her yearworn advertisement had been answered and not by a village
applicant no nothis letter was from away off yonder in the dim great
world to the North it was from St Louis She sat on her porch gazing
out with unseeing eyes upon the shining reaches of the mighty
Mississippi her thoughts steeped in her good fortune Indeed it was
specially good fortune for she was to have two lodgers instead of one

She had read the letter to the family and Rowena had danced away to see
to the cleaning and airing of the room by the slave woman Nancy and the
boys had rushed abroad in the town to spread the great news for it was a
matter of public interest and the public would wonder and not be pleased
if not informed Presently Rowena returned all ablush with joyous
excitement and begged for a rereading of the letter It was framed thus

HONORED MADAM My brother and I have seen your advertisement by chance
and beg leave to take the room you offer We are twentyfour years of
age and twins We are Italians by birth but have lived long in the
various countries of Europe and several years in the United States Our
names are Luigi and Angelo Capello You desire but one guest but dear
madam if you will allow us to pay for two we will not incommode you
We shall be down Thursday

Italians How romantic Just think Matheres never been one in this
town and everybody will be dying to see them and theyre all OURS
Think of that

Yes I reckon theyll make a grand stir

Oh indeed they will The whole town will be on its head
Thinktheyve been in Europe and everywhere Theres never been a
traveler in this town before Ma I shouldnt wonder if theyve seen
kings

Well a body cant tell but theyll make stir enough without that

Yes thats of course LuigiAngelo Theyre lovely names and so
grand and foreignnot like Jones and Robinson and such Thursday they
are coming and this is only Tuesday its a cruel long time to wait
Here comes Judge Driscoll in at the gate Hes heard about it Ill go
and open the door

The judge was full of congratulations and curiosity The letter was read
and discussed Soon Justice Robinson arrived with more congratulations
and there was a new reading and a new discussion This was the beginning
Neighbor after neighbor of both sexes followed and the procession
drifted in and out all day and evening and all Wednesday and Thursday
The letter was read and reread until it was nearly worn out everybody
admired its courtly and gracious tone and smooth and practiced style
everybody was sympathetic and excited and the Coopers were steeped in
happiness all the while

The boats were very uncertain in low water in these primitive times This
time the Thursday boat had not arrived at ten at nightso the people
had waited at the landing all day for nothing they were driven to their
homes by a heavy storm without having had a view of the illustrious
foreigners

Eleven oclock came and the Cooper house was the only one in the town
that still had lights burning The rain and thunder were booming yet
and the anxious family were still waiting still hoping At last there
was a knock at the door and the family jumped to open it Two Negro men
entered each carrying a trunk and proceeded upstairs toward the guest
room Then entered the twinsthe handsomest the best dressed the most
distinguishedlooking pair of young fellows the West had ever seen One
was a little fairer than the other but otherwise they were exact
duplicates

At breakfast in the morning the twins charm of manner and easy and
polished bearing made speedy conquest of the familys good graces All
constraint and formality quickly disappeared and the friendliest feeling
succeeded Aunt Patsy called them by their Christian names almost from
the beginning She was full of the keenest curiosity about them and
showed it they responded by talking about themselves which pleased her
greatly It presently appeared that in their early youth they had known
poverty and hardship As the talk wandered along the old lady watched
for the right place to drop in a question or two concerning that matter
and when she found it she said to the blond twin who was now doing the
biographies in his turn while the brunette one rested

If it aint asking what I ought not to ask Mr Angelo how did you come
to be so friendless and in such trouble when you were little Do you mind
telling But dont if you do

Oh we dont mind it at all madam in our case it was merely
misfortune and nobodys fault Our parents were well to do there in
Italy and we were their only child We were of the old Florentine
nobilityRowenas heart gave a great bound her nostrils expanded and
a fine light played in her eyesand when the war broke out my father
was on the losing side and had to fly for his life His estates were
confiscated his personal property seized and there we were in Germany
strangers friendless and in fact paupers My brother and I were ten
years old and well educated for that age very studious very fond of
our books and well grounded in the German French Spanish and English
languages Also we were marvelous musical prodigiesif you will allow
me to say it it being only the truth

Our father survived his misfortunes only a month our mother soon
followed him and we were alone in the world Our parents could have
made themselves comfortable by exhibiting us as a show and they had many
and large offers but the thought revolted their pride and they said
they would starve and die first But what they wouldnt consent to do
we had to do without the formality of consent We were seized for the
debts occasioned by their illness and their funerals and placed among
the attractions of a cheap museum in Berlin to earn the liquidation
money It took us two years to get out of that slavery We traveled all
about Germany receiving no wages and not even our keep We had to be
exhibited for nothing and beg our bread

Well madam the rest is not of much consequence When we escaped from
that slavery at twelve years of age we were in some respects men
Experience had taught us some valuable things among others how to take
care of ourselves how to avoid and defeat sharks and sharpers and how
to conduct our own business for our own profit and without other peoples
help We traveled everywhereyears and yearspicking up smatterings
of strange tongues familiarizing ourselves with strange sights and
strange customs accumulating an education of a wide and varied and
curious sort It was a pleasant life We went to Veniceto London
Paris Russia India China Japan

At this point Nancy the slave woman thrust her head in at the door and
exclaimed

Ole Missus de house is plum jam full o people en deys jes
aspilin to see de genlemen She indicated the twins with a nod of
her head and tucked it back out of sight again

It was a proud occasion for the widow and she promised herself high
satisfaction in showing off her fine foreign birds before her neighbors
and friendssimple folk who had hardly ever seen a foreigner of any
kind and never one of any distinction or style Yet her feeling was
moderate indeed when contrasted with Rowenas Rowena was in the clouds
she walked on air this was to be the greatest day the most romantic
episode in the colorless history of that dull country town She was to
be familiarly near the source of its glory and feel the full flood of it
pour over her and about her the other girls could only gaze and envy
not partake

The widow was ready Rowena was ready so also were the foreigners

The party moved along the hall the twins in advance and entered the
open parlor door whence issued a low hum of conversation The twins took
a position near the door the widow stood at Luigis side Rowena stood
beside Angelo and the marchpast and the introductions began The widow
was all smiles and contentment She received the procession and passed
it on to Rowena

Good mornin Sister Cooperhandshake

Good morning Brother HigginsCount Luigi Capello Mr Higgins
handshake followed by a devouring stare and Im glad to see ye
on the part of Higgins and a courteous inclination of the head and a
pleasant Most happy on the part of Count Luigi

Good mornin Rowenyhandshake

Good morning Mr Higginspresent you to Count Angelo Capello
Handshake admiring stare Glad to see yecourteous nod smily Most
happy and Higgins passes on

None of these visitors was at ease but being honest people they didnt
pretend to be None of them had ever seen a person bearing a title of
nobility before and none had been expecting to see one now consequently
the title came upon them as a kind of piledriving surprise and caught
them unprepared A few tried to rise to the emergency and got out an
awkward My lord or Your lordship or something of that sort but the
great majority were overwhelmed by the unaccustomed word and its dim and
awful associations with gilded courts and stately ceremony and anointed
kingship so they only fumbled through the handshake and passed on
speechless Now and then as happens at all receptions everywhere a
more than ordinary friendly soul blocked the procession and kept it
waiting while he inquired how the brothers liked the village and how
long they were going to stay and if their family was well and dragged
in the weather and hoped it would get cooler soon and all that sort of
thing so as to be able to say when he got home I had quite a long
talk with them but nobody did or said anything of a regrettable kind
and so the great affair went through to the end in a creditable and
satisfactory fashion

General conversation followed and the twins drifted about from group to
group talking easily and fluently and winning approval compelling
admiration and achieving favor from all The widow followed their
conquering march with a proud eye and every now and then Rowena said to
herself with deep satisfaction And to think they are oursall ours

There were no idle moments for mother or daughter Eager inquiries
concerning the twins were pouring into their enchanted ears all the time
each was the constant center of a group of breathless listeners each
recognized that she knew now for the first time the real meaning of that
great word Glory and perceived the stupendous value of it and
understood why men in all ages had been willing to throw away meaner
happiness treasure life itself to get a taste of its sublime and
supreme joy Napoleon and all his kind stood accounted forand
justified

When Rowena had at last done all her duty by the people in the parlor
she went upstairs to satisfy the longings of an overflow meeting there
for the parlor was not big enough to hold all the comers Again she was
besieged by eager questioners and again she swam in sunset seas of
glory When the forenoon was nearly gone she recognized with a pang
that this most splendid episode of her life was almost over that nothing
could prolong it that nothing quite its equal could ever fall to her
fortune again But never mind it was sufficient unto itself the grand
occasion had moved on an ascending scale from the start and was a noble
and memorable success If the twins could but do some crowning act now
to climax it something usual something startling something to
concentrate upon themselves the companys loftiest admiration something
in the nature of an electric surprise

Here a prodigious slambanging broke out below and everybody rushed down
to see It was the twins knocking out a classic fourhanded piece on
the piano in great style Rowena was satisfiedsatisfied down to the
bottom of her heart

The young strangers were kept long at the piano The villagers were
astonished and enchanted with the magnificence of their performance and
could not bear to have them stop All the music that they had ever heard
before seemed spiritless prenticework and barren of grace and charm when
compared with these intoxicating floods of melodious sound They realized
that for once in their lives they were hearing masters

 Wilsons Calendar


The company broke up reluctantly and drifted toward their several
homes chatting with vivacity and all agreeing that it would be many a
long day before Dawsons Landing would see the equal of this one again
The twins had accepted several invitations while the reception was in
progress and had also volunteered to play some duets at an amateur
entertainment for the benefit of a local charity Society was eager to
receive them to its bosom Judge Driscoll had the good fortune to secure
them for an immediate drive and to be the first to display them in
public They entered his buggy with him and were paraded down the main
street everybody flocking to the windows and sidewalks to see

The judge showed the strangers the new graveyard and the jail and where
the richest man lived and the Freemasons hall and the Methodist
church and the Presbyterian church and where the Baptist church was
going to be when they got some money to build it with and showed them
the town hall and the slaughterhouse and got out the independent fire
company in uniform and had them put out an imaginary fire then he let
them inspect the muskets of the militia company and poured out an
exhaustless stream of enthusiasm over all these splendors and seemed
very well satisfied with the responses he got for the twins admired his
admiration and paid him back the best they could though they could have
done better if some fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand previous
experiences of this sort in various countries had not already rubbed off
a considerable part of the novelty in it

The judge laid himself out hospitality to make them have a good time and
if there was a defect anywhere it was not his fault He told them a good
many humorous anecdotes and always forgot the nub but they were always
able to furnish it for these yarns were of a pretty early vintage and
they had had many a rejuvenating pull at them before And he told them
all about his several dignities and how he had held this and that and
the other place of honor or profit and had once been to the legislature
and was now president of the Society of Freethinkers He said the
society had been in existence four years and already had two members
and was firmly established He would call for the brothers in the
evening if they would like to attend a meeting of it

Accordingly he called for them and on the way he told them all about
Puddnhead Wilson in order that they might get a favorable impression of
him in advance and be prepared to like him This scheme succeededthe
favorable impression was achieved Later it was confirmed and solidified
when Wilson proposed that out of courtesy to the strangers the usual
topics be put aside and the hour be devoted to conversation upon ordinary
subjects and the cultivation of friendly relations and goodfellowshipa
proposition which was put to vote and carried

The hour passed quickly away in lively talk and when it was ended the
lonesome and neglected Wilson was richer by two friends than he had been
when it began He invited the twins to look in at his lodgings
presently after disposing of an intervening engagement and they
accepted with pleasure

Toward the middle of the evening they found themselves on the road to
his house Puddnhead was at home waiting for them and putting in his
time puzzling over a thing which had come under his notice that morning
The matter was this He happened to be up very earlyat dawn in fact
and he crossed the hall which divided his cottage through the center
and entered a room to get something there The window of the room had no
curtains for that side of the house had long been unoccupied and
through this window he caught sight of something which surprised and
interested him It was a young womana young woman where properly no
young woman belonged for she was in Judge Driscolls house and in the
bedroom over the judges private study or sitting room This was young
Tom Driscolls bedroom He and the judge the judges widowed sister Mrs
Pratt and three Negro servants were the only people who belonged in the
house Who then might this young lady be The two houses were
separated by an ordinary yard with a low fence running back through its
middle from the street in front to the lane in the rear The distance
was not great and Wilson was able to see the girl very well the window
shades of the room she was in being up and the window also The girl had
on a neat and trim summer dress patterned in broad stripes of pink and
white and her bonnet was equipped with a pink veil She was practicing
steps gaits and attitudes apparently she was doing the thing
gracefully and was very much absorbed in her work Who could she be and
how came she to be in young Tom Driscolls room

Wilson had quickly chosen a position from which he could watch the girl
without running much risk of being seen by her and he remained there
hoping she would raise her veil and betray her face But she
disappointed him After a matter of twenty minutes she disappeared and
although he stayed at his post half an hour longer she came no more

Toward noon he dropped in at the judges and talked with Mrs Pratt about
the great event of the day the levee of the distinguished foreigners at
Aunt Patsy Coopers He asked after her nephew Tom and she said he was
on his way home and that she was expecting him to arrive a little before
night and added that she and the judge were gratified to gather from his
letters that he was conducting himself very nicely and creditablyat
which Wilson winked to himself privately Wilson did not ask if there was
a newcomer in the house but he asked questions that would have brought
lightthrowing answers as to that matter if Mrs Pratt had had any light
to throw so he went away satisfied that he knew of things that were
going on in her house of which she herself was not aware

He was now awaiting for the twins and still puzzling over the problem of
who that girl might be and how she happened to be in that young fellows
room at daybreak in the morning

It is necessary now to hunt up Roxy

At the time she was set free and went away chambermaiding she was
thirtyfive She got a berth as second chambermaid on a Cincinnati boat
in the New Orleans trade the _Grand Mogul_ A couple of trips made her
wonted and easygoing at the work and infatuated her with the stir and
adventure and independence of steamboat life Then she was promoted and
become head chambermaid She was a favorite with the officers and
exceedingly proud of their joking and friendly way with her

During eight years she served three parts of the year on that boat and
the winters on a Vicksburg packet But now for two months she had had
rheumatism in her arms and was obliged to let the washtub alone So she
resigned But she was well fixedrich as she would have described it
for she had lived a steady life and had banked four dollars every month
in New Orleans as a provision for her old age She said in the start
that she had put shoes on one barfooted nigger to tromple on her with
and that one mistake like that was enough she would be independent of
the human race thenceforth forevermore if hard work and economy could
accomplish it When the boat touched the levee at New Orleans she bade
goodby to her comrades on the _Grand Mogul_ and moved her kit ashore

But she was back in a hour The bank had gone to smash and carried her
four hundred dollars with it She was a pauper and homeless Also
disabled bodily at least for the present The officers were full of
sympathy for her in her trouble and made up a little purse for her She
resolved to go to her birthplace she had friends there among the Negros
and the unfortunate always help the unfortunate she was well aware of
that those lowly comrades of her youth would not let her starve

She took the little local packet at Cairo and now she was on the
homestretch Time had worn away her bitterness against her son and she
was able to think of him with serenity She put the vile side of him out
of her mind and dwelt only on recollections of his occasional acts of
kindness to her She gilded and otherwise decorated these and made them
very pleasant to contemplate She began to long to see him She would go
and fawn upon him slavelikefor this would have to be her attitude of
courseand maybe she would find that time had modified him and that he
would be glad to see his longforgotten old nurse and treat her gently
That would be lovely that would make her forget her woes and her
poverty

Her poverty That thought inspired her to add another castle to her
dream maybe he would give her a trifle now and thenmaybe a dollar
once a month say any little thing like that would help oh ever so
much

By the time she reached Dawsons Landing she was her old self again her
blues were gone she was in high feather She would get along surely
there were many kitchens where the servants would share their meals with
her and also steal sugar and apples and other dainties for her to carry
homeor give her a chance to pilfer them herself which would answer
just as well And there was the church She was a more rabid and devoted
Methodist than ever and her piety was no sham but was strong and
sincere Yes with plenty of creature comforts and her old place in the
amen corner in her possession again she would be perfectly happy and at
peace thenceforward to the end

She went to Judge Driscolls kitchen first of all She was received
there in great form and with vast enthusiasm Her wonderful travels and
the strange countries she had seen and the adventures she had had made
her a marvel and a heroine of romance The Negros hung enchanted upon a
great story of her experiences interrupting her all along with eager
questions with laughter exclamations of delight and expressions of
applause and she was obliged to confess to herself that if there was
anything better in this world than steamboating it was the glory to be
got by telling about it The audience loaded her stomach with their
dinners and then stole the pantry bare to load up her basket

Tom was in St Louis The servants said he had spent the best part of
his time there during the previous two years Roxy came every day and
had many talks about the family and its affairs Once she asked why Tom
was away so much The ostensible Chambers said

De fac is ole marster kin git along better when young marsters away
den he kin when hes in de town yes en he love him better too so he
gives him fifty dollahs a month

No is dat so Chambers yous ajokin aint you

Clah to goodness I aint Mammy Marse Tom tole me so his own self But
nemmine taint enough

My lan what de reason taint enough

Well Is gwine to tell you if you gimme a chanst Mammy De reason it
aint enough is case Marse Tom gambles

Roxy threw up her hands in astonishment and Chambers went on

Ole marster found it out case he had to pay two hundred dollahs for
Marse Toms gamblin debts en dats true Mammy jes as dead certain as
yous bawn

Twohundd dollahs Why what is you talkin bout
Twohundddollahs Sakes alive its mos enough to buy a tolable
good secondhand nigger wid En you aint lyin honey You wouldnt lie

Its Gods own truth jes as I tell youtwo hundd dollahsI wisht I
may never stir outen my tracks if it aint so En oh my lan ole Marse

dissenhurrit him

Disen_whiched_ him

Dissenhurrit him

Whats dat What do you mean

Means he busted de will

Busted de will He wouldnt _ever_ treat him so Take it back you
misable imitation nigger dat I bore in sorrow en tribbilation

Roxys pet castlean occasional dollar from Toms pocketwas tumbling
to ruin before her eyes She could not abide such a disaster as that
she couldnt endure the thought of it Her remark amused Chambers

Yahyahyah Jes listen to dat If Is imitation what is you Bofe of
us is imitation _white_dats what we isen powful good imitation
too Yahyahyah We dont mount to nothn as imitation _niggers_ en
as for

Shet up yo foolin fo I knock you side de head en tell me bout de
will Tell me taint busteddo honey en Ill never forgit you

Well _taint_case deys a new one made en Marse Toms all right
agin But what is you in sich a sweat bout it for Mammy Taint
none o your business I dont reckon

Taint none o my business Whose business is it den Id like to
know Wuz I his mother tell he was fifteen years old or wusnt Iyou
answer me dat En you speck I could see him turned out po and ornery on
de worl en never care nothn bout it I reckon if youd ever ben a
mother yoself Valet de Chambers you wouldnt talk sich foolishness as
dat

Well den ole Marse forgive him en fixed up de will agindo dat
satisfy you

Yes she was satisfied now and quite happy and sentimental over it She
kept coming daily and at last she was told that Tom had come home She
began to tremble with emotion and straightway sent to beg him to let his
po ole nigger Mammy have jes one sight of him en die for joy

Tom was stretched at his lazy ease on a sofa when Chambers brought the
petition Time had not modified his ancient detestation of the humble
drudge and protector of his boyhood it was still bitter and
uncompromising He sat up and bent a severe gaze upon the face of the
young fellow whose name he was unconsciously using and whose family
rights he was enjoying He maintained the gaze until the victim of it
had become satisfactorily pallid with terror then he said

What does the old rip want with me

The petition was meekly repeated

Who gave you permission to come and disturb me with the social
attentions of niggers

Tom had risen The other young man was trembling now visibly He saw
what was coming and bent his head sideways and put up his left arm to
shield it Tom rained cuffs upon the head and its shield saying no
word the victim received each blow with a beseeching Please Marse
Tomoh please Marse Tom Seven blowsthen Tom said Face the
doormarch He followed behind with one two three solid kicks The
last one helped the purewhite slave over the doorsill and he limped
away mopping his eyes with his old ragged sleeve Tom shouted after
him Send her in

Then he flung himself panting on the sofa again and rasped out the
remark He arrived just at the right moment I was full to the brim with
bitter thinkings and nobody to take it out of How refreshing it was
I feel better

Toms mother entered now closing the door behind her and approached her
son with all the wheedling and supplication servilities that fear and
interest can impart to the words and attitudes of the born slave She
stopped a yard from her boy and made two or three admiring exclamations
over his manly stature and general handsomeness and Tom put an arm under
his head and hoisted a leg over the sofa back in order to look properly
indifferent

My lan how you is growed honey Clah to goodness I wouldnt
aknowed you Marse Tom Deed I wouldnt Look at me good does you
member old Roxy Does you know yo old nigger mammy honey Well now I
kin lay down en die in peace case Ise seed

Cut it short Goddamn it cut it short What is it you want

You heah dat Jes the same old Marse Tom alays so gay and funnin wid
de ole mammy Iuz jes as shore

Cut it short I tell you and get along What do you want

This was a bitter disappointment Roxy had for so many days nourished
and fondled and petted her notion that Tom would be glad to see his old
nurse and would make her proud and happy to the marrow with a cordial
word or two that it took two rebuffs to convince her that he was not
funning and that her beautiful dream was a fond and foolish variety a
shabby and pitiful mistake She was hurt to the heart and so ashamed
that for a moment she did not quite know what to do or how to act Then
her breast began to heave the tears came and in her forlornness she was
moved to try that other dream of hersan appeal to her boys charity
and so upon the impulse and without reflection she offered her
supplication

Oh Marse Tom de po ole mammy is in sich hard luck dese days en shes
kinder crippled in de arms and cant work en if you could gimme a
dollahony jes one little dol

Tom was on his feet so suddenly that the supplicant was startled into a
jump herself

A dollargive you a dollar Ive a notion to strangle you Is _that_
your errand here Clear out And be quick about it

Roxy backed slowly toward the door When she was halfway she stopped
and said mournfully

Marse Tom I nussed you when you was a little baby en I raised you all
by myself tell you was most a young man en now you is young en rich en
I is po en gittn ole en I come heah bleavin dat you would hep de
ole mammy long down de little road dats lef twix her en de grave
en

Tom relished this tune less than any that he had preceded it for it
began to wake up a sort of echo in his conscience so he interrupted and
said with decision though without asperity that he was not in a
situation to help her and wasnt going to do it

Aint you ever gwine to hep me Marse Tom

No Now go away and dont bother me any more

Roxys head was down in an attitude of humility But now the fires of
her old wrongs flamed up in her breast and began to burn fiercely She
raised her head slowly till it was well up and at the same time her
great frame unconsciously assumed an erect and masterful attitude with
all the majesty and grace of her vanished youth in it She raised her
finger and punctuated with it

You has said de word You has had yo chance en you has trompled it
under yo foot When you git another one youll git down on yo knees
en _beg_ for it

A cold chill went to Toms heart he didnt know why for he did not
reflect that such words from such an incongruous source and so solemnly
delivered could not easily fail of that effect However he did the
natural thing he replied with bluster and mockery

_Youll_ give me a chance_you_ Perhaps Id better get down on my
knees now But in case I dontjust for arguments sakewhats going
to happen pray

Dis is what is gwine to happen Is gwine as straight to yo uncle as I
kin walk en tell him every las thing I knows bout you

Toms cheek blenched and she saw it Disturbing thoughts began to chase
each other through his head How can she know And yet she must have
found outshe looks it Ive had the will back only three months and
am already deep in debt again and moving heaven and earth to save myself
from exposure and destruction with a reasonably fair show of getting the
thing covered up if Im let alone and now this fiend has gone and found
me out somehow or other I wonder how much she knows Oh oh oh its
enough to break a bodys heart But Ive got to humor hertheres no
other way

Then he worked up a rather sickly sample of a gay laugh and a hollow
chipperness of manner and said

Well well Roxy dear old friends like you and me mustnt quarrel
Heres your dollarnow tell me what you know

He held out the wildcat bill she stood as she was and made no movement
It was her turn to scorn persuasive foolery now and she did not waste
it She said with a grim implacability in voice and manner which made
Tom almost realize that even a former slave can remember for ten minutes
insults and injuries returned for compliments and flatteries received
and can also enjoy taking revenge for them when the opportunity offers

What does I know Ill tell you what I knows I knows enough to bust
dat will to flindersen more mind you _more_

Tom was aghast

More he said What do you call more Wheres there any room for
more

Roxy laughed a mocking laugh and said scoffingly with a toss of her
head and her hands on her hips

Yesoh I reckon _cose_ youd like to knowwid yo po little ole
rag dollah What you reckon Is gwine to tell _you_ foryou aint got
no money Is gwine to tell yo uncleen Ill do it dis minute
toohell gimme FIVE dollahs for de news en mighty glad too

She swung herself around disdainfully and started away Tom was in a
panic He seized her skirts and implored her to wait She turned and
said loftily

Lookaheah what uz it I tole you

YouyouI dont remember anything What was it you told me

I tole you dat de next time I give you a chance youd git down on yo
knees en beg for it

Tom was stupefied for a moment He was panting with excitement Then he
said

Oh Roxy you wouldnt require your young master to do such a horrible
thing You cant mean it

Ill let you know mighty quick whether I means it or not You call me
names en as good as spit on me when I comes here po en ornery en
umble to praise you for bein growed up so fine and handsome en tell

nigger a dollah for to get her somn to eat en you call me
names_names_ dad blame you Yassir I gives you jes one chance mo
and dats _now_ en it las ony half a secondyou hear

Tom slumped to his knees and began to beg saying

You see Im begging and its honest begging too Now tell me Roxy
tell me

The heir of two centuries of unatoned insult and outrage looked down on
him and seemed to drink in deep draughts of satisfaction Then she said

Fine nice young white genlman kneelin down to a nigger wench Is
wanted to see dat jes once befo Is called Now Gabrel blow de hawn
Is ready    Git up

Tom did it He said humbly

Now Roxy dont punish me any more I deserved what Ive got but be
good and let me off with that Dont go to uncle Tell meIll give

Yes I bet you will en you wont stop dah nuther But I aint gwine
to tell you heah

Gimme de dollah bill He gave it to her She examined it and said
Hmlike enough de banks busted She started again but halted
again Has you got any whisky

Yes a little

Fetch it

He ran to his room overhead and brought down a bottle which was
twothirds full She tilted it up and took a drink Her eyes sparkled
with satisfaction and she tucked the bottle under her shawl saying
Its prime Ill take it along

Tom humbly held the door for her and she marched out as grim and erect
as a grenadier




CHAPTER 9  Tom Practices Sycophancy

 _Why is it that we rejoice at a birth and grieve at a
 funeral It is because we are not the person involved_
 Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar

 _It is easy to find fault if one has that disposition
 There was once a man who not being able to find any other
 fault with his coal complained that there were too many
 prehistoric toads in it_ Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


Tom flung himself on the sofa and put his throbbing head in his hands
and rested his elbows on his knees He rocked himself back and forth and
moaned

Ive knelt to a nigger wench he muttered I thought I had struck the
deepest depths of degradation before but oh dear it was nothing to
this    Well there is one consolation such as it isIve struck
bottom this time theres nothing lower

But that was a hasty conclusion

At ten that night he climbed the ladder in the haunted house pale weak
and wretched Roxy was standing in the door of one of the rooms
waiting for she had heard him

This was a twostory log house which had acquired the reputation a few
years ago of being haunted and that was the end of its usefulness
Nobody would live in it afterward or go near it by night and most
people even gave it a wide berth in the daytime As it had no
competition it was called _the_ haunted house It was getting crazy and
ruinous now from long neglect It stood three hundred yards beyond
Puddnhead Wilsons house with nothing between but vacancy It was the
last house in the town at that end

Tom followed Roxy into the room She had a pile of clean straw in the
corner for a bed some cheap but wellkept clothing was hanging on the
wall there was a tin lantern freckling the floor with little spots of
light and there were various soap and candle boxes scattered about
which served for chairs The two sat down Roxy said

Now den Ill tell you straight off en Ill begin to kleck de money
later on I aint in no hurry What does you reckon Is gwine to tell
you

Well youyouoh Roxy dont make it too hard for me Come right out
and tell me youve found out somehow what a shape Im in on account of
dissipation and foolishness

Disposition en foolishness NO sir dat aint it Dat jist aint
nothin at all longside o what _I_ knows

Tom stared at her and said

Why Roxy what do you mean

She rose and gloomed above him like a Fate

I means disen its de Lords truth You aint no more kin to ole
Marse Driscoll den I is _dats_ what I means and her eyes flamed
with triumph

What

Yassir en _dat_ aint all Yous a _nigger__bawn_ a nigger and a
_slave_en yous a nigger en a slave dis minute en if I opens my mouf
ole Marse Driscollll sell you down de river befo you is two days older

It aint no lie nuther Its just de truth en nothin _but_ de truth
so hep me Yassiryous my _son_

You devil

En dat po boy dat yous ben akickin en acuffin today is Percy
Driscolls son en yo _marster_

You beast

En _his_ name is Tom Driscoll en _yos_ names Valet de Chambers en
you aint GOT no fambly name becase niggers dont _have_ em

Tom sprang up and seized a billet of wood and raised it but his mother
only laughed at him and said

Set down you pup Does you think you kin skyer me It aint in you
nor de likes of you I reckon youd shoot me in de back maybe if you
got a chance for dats jist yo style_I_ knows you throo en
throobut I dont mind gittn killed becase all dis is down in writin
and its in safe hands too en de man dats got it knows whah to look
for de right man when I gits killed Oh bless yo soul if you puts yo
mother up for as big a fool as _you_ is yous powful mistaken I kin
tell you Now den you set still en behave yoself en dont you git up
agin till I tell you

Tom fretted and chafed awhile in a whirlwind of disorganizing sensations
and emotions and finally said with something like settled conviction

The whole thing is moonshine now then go ahead and do your worst Im
done with you

Roxy made no answer She took the lantern and started for the door Tom
was in a cold panic in a moment

Come back come back he wailed I didnt mean it Roxy I take it
all back and Ill never say it again Please come back Roxy

The woman stood a moment then she said gravely

Dats one thing yous got to stop Valet de Chambers You cant call me
_Roxy_ same as if you was my equal Chillen dont speak to dey mammies
like dat Youll call me ma or mammy dats what youll call
meleastways when de aint nobody aroun _Say_ it

It cost Tom a struggle but he got it out

Dats all right dont you ever forgit it agin if you knows whats
good for you Now den you had said you wouldnt ever call it lies en
moonshine agin Ill tell you dis for a warnin if you ever does say
it agin its de LAS time youll ever say it to me Ill tramp as
straight to de judge as I kin walk en tell him who you is en _prove_
it Does you blieve me when I says dat

Oh groaned Tom I more than believe it I _know_ it

Roxy knew her conquest was complete She could have proved nothing to
anybody and her threat of writings was a lie but she knew the person
she was dealing with and had made both statements without any doubt as
to the effect they would produce

She went and sat down on her candle box and the pride and pomp of her
victorious attitude made it a throne She said

Now den Chambers wes gwine to talk business en dey aint gwine to be
no mo foolishness In de fust place you gits fifty dollahs a month
yous gwine to han over half of it to yo ma Plank it out

But Tom had only six dollars in the world He gave her that and
promised to start fair on next months pension

Chambers how much is you in debt

Tom shuddered and said

Nearly three hundred dollars

How is you gwine to pay it

Tom groaned out Oh I dont know dont ask me such awful questions

But she stuck to her point until she wearied a confession out of him he
had been prowling about in disguise stealing small valuables from
private houses in fact he made a good deal of a raid on his fellow
villagers a fortnight before when he was supposed to be in St Louis
but he doubted if he had sent away enough stuff to realize the required
amount and was afraid to make a further venture in the present excited
state of the town His mother approved of his conduct and offered to
help but this frightened him He tremblingly ventured to say that if
she would retire from the town he should feel better and safer and could
hold his head higherand was going on to make an argument but she
interrupted and surprised him pleasantly by saying she was ready it
didnt make any difference to her where she stayed so that she got her
share of the pension regularly She said she would not go far and would
call at the haunted house once a month for her money Then she said

I dont hate you so much now but Ive hated you a many a yearand
anybody would Didnt I change you off en give you a good fambly en a
good name en made you a white genlman en rich wid store clothes
onen what did I git for it You despised me all de time en was alays
sayin mean hard things to me befo folks en wouldnt ever let me forgit
Is a niggerenen

She fell to sobbing and broke down Tom said But you know I didnt
know you were my mother and besides

Well nemmine bout dat now let it go Is gwine to fogit it Then
she added fiercely En dont ever make me remember it agin or youll
be sorry _I_ tell you

When they were parting Tom said in the most persuasive way he could
command

Ma would you mind telling me who was my father

He had supposed he was asking an embarrassing question He was mistaken
Roxy drew herself up with a proud toss of her head and said

Does I mine tellin you No dat I dont You aint got no casion to
be shame o yo father _I_ kin tell you He wuz de highest quality in
dis whole townole Virginny stock Fust famblies he wuz Jes as good
stock as de Driscolls en de Howards de bes day dey ever seed She put
on a little prouder air if possible and added impressively Does you
member Cunnel Cecil Burleigh Essex dat died de same year yo young
Marse Tom Driscolls pappy died en all de Masons en Odd Fellers en
Churches turned out en give him de bigges funeral dis town ever seed
Dats de man

Under the inspiration of her soaring complacency the departed graces of
her earlier days returned to her and her bearing took to itself a
dignity and state that might have passed for queenly if her surroundings
had been a little more in keeping with it

Dey aint another nigger in dis town dats as highbawn as you is Now
den go long En jes you hold yo head up as high as you want toyou
has de right en dat I kin swah

 Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


Every now and then after Tom went to bed he had sudden wakings out of
his sleep and his first thought was Oh joy it was all a dream
Then he laid himself heavily down again with a groan and the muttered
words A nigger I am a nigger Oh I wish I was dead

He woke at dawn with one more repetition of this horror and then he
resolved to meddle no more with that treacherous sleep He began to
think Sufficiently bitter thinkings they were They wandered along
something after this fashion

Why were niggers _and_ whites made What crime did the uncreated first
nigger commit that the curse of birth was decreed for him And why is
this awful difference made between white and black    How hard the
niggers fate seems this morningyet until last night such a thought
never entered my head

He sighed and groaned an hour or more away Then Chambers came humbly
in to say that breakfast was nearly ready Tom blushed scarlet to see
this aristocratic white youth cringe to him a nigger and call him
Young Marster He said roughly

Get out of my sight and when the youth was gone he muttered He has
done me no harm poor wretch but he is an eyesore to me now for he is
Driscoll the young gentleman and I am aoh I wish I was dead

A gigantic eruption like that of Krakatoa a few years ago with the
accompanying earthquakes tidal waves and clouds of volcanic dust
changes the face of the surrounding landscape beyond recognition
bringing down the high lands elevating the low making fair lakes where
deserts had been and deserts where green prairies had smiled before
The tremendous catastrophe which had befallen Tom had changed his moral
landscape in much the same way Some of his low places he found lifted to
ideals some of his ideas had sunk to the valleys and lay there with the
sackcloth and ashes of pumice stone and sulphur on their ruined heads

For days he wandered in lonely places thinking thinking thinking
trying to get his bearings It was new work If he met a friend he
found that the habit of a lifetime had in some mysterious way vanished
his arm hung limp instead of involuntarily extending the hand for a
shake It was the nigger in him asserting its humility and he blushed
and was abashed And the nigger in him was surprised when the white
friend put out his hand for a shake with him He found the nigger in
him involuntarily giving the road on the sidewalk to a white rowdy and
loafer When Rowena the dearest thing his heart knew the idol of his
secret worship invited him in the nigger in him made an embarrassed
excuse and was afraid to enter and sit with the dread white folks on
equal terms The nigger in him went shrinking and skulking here and
there and yonder and fancying it saw suspicion and maybe detection in
all faces tones and gestures So strange and uncharacteristic was
Toms conduct that people noticed it and turned to look after him when
he passed on and when he glanced backas he could not help doing in
spite of his best resistanceand caught that puzzled expression in a
persons face it gave him a sick feeling and he took himself out of
view as quickly as he could He presently came to have a hunted sense
and a hunted look and then he fled away to the hilltops and the
solitudes He said to himself that the curse of Ham was upon him

He dreaded his meals the nigger in him was ashamed to sit at the white
folks table and feared discovery all the time and once when Judge
Driscoll said Whats the matter with you You look as meek as a
nigger he felt as secret murderers are said to feel when the accuser
says Thou art the man Tom said he was not well and left the table

His ostensible aunts solicitudes and endearments were become a terror
to him and he avoided them

And all the time hatred of his ostensible uncle was steadily growing
in his heart for he said to himself He is white and I am his chattel
his property his goods and he can sell me just as he could his dog

For as much as a week after this Tom imagined that his character had
undergone a pretty radical change But that was because he did not know
himself

In several ways his opinions were totally changed and would never go
back to what they were before but the main structure of his character
was not changed and could not be changed One or two very important
features of it were altered and in time effects would result from this
if opportunity offeredeffects of a quite serious nature too Under the
influence of a great mental and moral upheaval his character and his
habits had taken on the appearance of complete change but after a while
with the subsidence of the storm both began to settle toward their
former places He dropped gradually back into his old frivolous and
easygoing ways and conditions of feeling and manner of speech and no
familiar of his could have detected anything in him that differentiated
him from the weak and careless Tom of other days

The theft raid which he had made upon the village turned out better than
he had ventured to hope It produced the sum necessary to pay his gaming
debts and saved him from exposure to his uncle and another smashing of
the will He and his mother learned to like each other fairly well She
couldnt love him as yet because there warnt nothing _to_ him as
she expressed it but her nature needed something or somebody to rule
over and he was better than nothing Her strong character and
aggressive and commanding ways compelled Toms admiration in spite of the
fact that he got more illustrations of them than he needed for his
comfort However as a rule her conversation was made up of racy tales
about the privacies of the chief families of the town for she went
harvesting among their kitchens every time she came to the village and
Tom enjoyed this It was just in his line She always collected her
half of his pension punctually and he was always at the haunted house to
have a chat with her on these occasions Every now and then she paid
him a visit there on betweendays also

Occasions he would run up to St Louis for a few weeks and at last
temptation caught him again He won a lot of money but lost it and
with it a deal more besides which he promised to raise as soon as
possible

For this purpose he projected a new raid on his town He never meddled
with any other town for he was afraid to venture into houses whose ins
and outs he did not know and the habits of whose households he was not
acquainted with He arrived at the haunted house in disguise on the
Wednesday before the advent of the twinsafter writing his Aunt Pratt
that he would not arrive until two days afterand laying in hiding there
with his mother until toward daylight Friday morning when he went to his
uncles house and entered by the back way with his own key and slipped
up to his room where he could have the use of the mirror and toilet
articles He had a suit of girls clothes with him in a bundle as a
disguise for his raid and was wearing a suit of his mothers clothing
with black gloves and veil By dawn he was tricked out for his raid but
he caught a glimpse of Puddnhead Wilson through the window over the way
and knew that Puddnhead had caught a glimpse of him So he entertained
Wilson with some airs and graces and attitudes for a while then stepped
out of sight and resumed the other disguise and by and by went down and
out the back way and started downtown to reconnoiter the scene of his
intended labors

But he was ill at ease He had changed back to Roxys dress with the
stoop of age added to the disguise so that Wilson would not bother
himself about a humble old women leaving a neighbors house by the back
way in the early morning in case he was still spying But supposing
Wilson had seen him leave and had thought it suspicious and had also
followed him The thought made Tom cold He gave up the raid for the
day and hurried back to the haunted house by the obscurest route he
knew His mother was gone but she came back by and by with the news of
the grand reception at Patsy Coopers and soon persuaded him that the
opportunity was like a special Providence it was so inviting and
perfect So he went raiding after all and made a nice success of it
while everybody was gone to Patsy Coopers Success gave him nerve and
even actual intrepidity insomuch indeed that after he had conveyed his
harvest to his mother in a back alley he went to the reception himself
and added several of the valuables of that house to his takings

After this long digression we have now arrived once more at the point
where Puddnhead Wilson while waiting for the arrival of the twins on
that same Friday evening sat puzzling over the strange apparition of
that morninga girl in young Tom Driscolls bedroom fretting and
guessing and puzzling over it and wondering who the shameless creature
might be




CHAPTER 11  Puddnheads Thrilling Discovery

 _There are three infallible ways of pleasing an author and
 the three form a rising scale of compliment 1to tell him
 you have read one of his books 2to tell him you have read
 all of his books 3to ask him to let you read the
 manuscript of his forthcoming book No 1 admits you to his
 respect No 2 admits you to his admiration No 3 carries
 you clear into his heart_ Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar

 _As to the Adjective when in doubt strike it out_
 Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


The twins arrived presently and talk began It flowed along chattily
and sociably and under its influence the new friendship gathered ease
and strength Wilson got out his Calendar by request and read a
passage or two from it which the twins praised quite cordially This
pleased the author so much that he complied gladly when they asked him to
lend them a batch of the work to read at home In the course of their
wide travels they had found out that there are three sure ways of
pleasing an author they were now working the best of the three

There was an interruption now Young Driscoll appeared and joined the
party He pretended to be seeing the distinguished strangers for the
first time when they rose to shake hands but this was only a blind as
he had already had a glimpse of them at the reception while robbing the
house The twins made mental note that he was smoothfaced and rather
handsome and smooth and undulatory in his movementsgraceful in fact
Angelo thought he had a good eye Luigi thought there was something
veiled and sly about it Angelo thought he had a pleasant freeandeasy
way of talking Luigi thought it was more so than was agreeable Angelo
thought he was a sufficiently nice young man Luigi reserved his
decision Toms first contribution to the conversation was a question
which he had put to Wilson a hundred times before It was always cheerily
and goodnatured put and always inflicted a little pang for it touched
a secret sore but this time the pang was sharp since strangers were
present

Well how does the law come on Had a case yet

Wilson bit his lip but answered Nonot yet with as much
indifference as he could assume Judge Driscoll had generously left the
law feature out of Wilsons biography which he had furnished to the
twins Young Tom laughed pleasantly and said

Wilsons a lawyer gentlemen but he doesnt practice now

The sarcasm bit but Wilson kept himself under control and said without
passion

I dont practice it is true It is true that I have never had a case
and have had to earn a poor living for twenty years as an expert
accountant in a town where I cant get a hold of a set of books to
untangle as often as I should like But it is also true that I did
myself well for the practice of the law By the time I was your age
Tom I had chosen a profession and was soon competent to enter upon it
Tom winced I never got a chance to try my hand at it and I may never
get a chance and yet if I ever do get it I shall be found ready for I
have kept up my law studies all these years

Thats it thats good grit I like to see it Ive a notion to throw
all my business your way My business and your law practice ought to
make a pretty gay team Dave and the young fellow laughed again

If you will throw Wilson had thought of the girl in Toms bedroom
and was going to say If you will throw the surreptitious and
disreputable part of your business my way it may amount to something
but thought better of it and said

However this matter doesnt fit well in a general conversation

All right well change the subject I guess you were about to give me
another dig anyway so Im willing to change Hows the Awful Mystery
flourishing these days Wilsons got a scheme for driving plain window
glass panes out of the market by decorating it with greasy finger marks
and getting rich by selling it at famine prices to the crowned heads over
in Europe to outfit their palaces with Fetch it out Dave

Wilson brought three of his glass strips and said

I get the subject to pass the fingers of his right hand through his hair
so as to get a little coating of the natural oil on them and then press
the balls of them on the glass A fine and delicate print of the lines
in the skin results and is permanent if it doesnt come in contact with
something able to rub it off You begin Tom

Why I think you took my finger marks once or twice before

Yes but you were a little boy the last time only about twelve years
old

Thats so Of course Ive changed entirely since then and variety is
what the crowned heads want I guess

He passed his fingers through his crop of short hair and pressed them
one at a time on the glass Angelo made a print of his fingers on
another glass and Luigi followed with a third Wilson marked the
glasses with names and dates and put them away Tom gave one of his
little laughs and said

I thought I wouldnt say anything but if variety is what you are after
you have wasted a piece of glass The hand print of one twin is the same
as the hand print of the fellow twin

Well its done now and I like to have them both anyway said Wilson
returned to his place

But look here Dave said Tom you used to tell peoples fortunes too
when you took their finger marks Daves just an allround geniusa
genius of the first water gentlemen a great scientist running to seed
here in this village a prophet with the kind of honor that prophets
generally get at homefor here they dont give shucks for his
scientifics and they call his skull a notion factoryhey Dave aint
it so But never mind hell make his mark somedayfinger mark you
know hehe But really you want to let him take a shy at your palms
once its worth twice the price of admission or your moneys returned at
the door Why hell read your wrinkles as easy as a book and not only
tell you fifty or sixty things thats going to happen to you but fifty
or sixty thousand that aint Come Dave show the gentlemen what an
inspired jackatallscience weve got in this town and dont know it

Wilson winced under this nagging and not very courteous chaff and the
twins suffered with him and for him They rightly judged now that the
best way to relieve him would be to take the thing in earnest and
treat it with respect ignoring Toms rather overdone raillery so Luigi
said

We have seen something of palmistry in our wanderings and know very
well what astonishing things it can do If it isnt a science and one
of the greatest of them too I dont know what its other name ought to
be In the Orient

Tom looked surprised and incredulous He said

That juggling a science But really you aint serious are you

Yes entirely so Four years ago we had our hands read out to us as if
our plans had been covered with print

Well do you mean to say there was actually anything in it asked Tom
his incredulity beginning to weaken a little

There was this much in it said Angelo what was told us of our
characters was minutely exactwe could have not have bettered it
ourselves Next two or three memorable things that have happened to us
were laid barethings which no one present but ourselves could have
known about

Why its rank sorcery exclaimed Tom who was now becoming very much
interested And how did they make out with what was going to happen to
you in the future

On the whole quite fairly said Luigi Two or three of the most
striking things foretold have happened since much the most striking one
of all happened within that same year Some of the minor prophesies have
come true some of the minor and some of the major ones have not been
fulfilled yet and of course may never be still I should be more
surprised if they failed to arrive than if they didnt

Tom was entirely sobered and profoundly impressed He said
apologetically

Dave I wasnt meaning to belittle that science I was only chaffing
chattering I reckon Id better say I wish you would look at their
palms Come wont you

Why certainly if you want me to but you know Ive had no chance to
become an expert and dont claim to be one When a past event is
somewhat prominently recorded in the palm I can generally detect that
but minor ones often escape menot always of course but oftenbut I
havent much confidence in myself when it comes to reading the future I
am talking as if palmistry was a daily study with me but that is not so
I havent examined half a dozen hands in the last half dozen years you
see the people got to joking about it and I stopped to let the talk die
down Ill tell you what well do Count Luigi Ill make a try at your
past and if I have any success thereno on the whole Ill let the
future alone thats really the affair of an expert

He took Luigis hand Tom said

Waitdont look yet Dave Count Luigi heres paper and pencil Set
down that thing that you said was the most striking one that was foretold
to you and happened less than a year afterward and give it to me so I
can see if Dave finds it in your hand

Luigi wrote a line privately and folded up the piece of paper and
handed it to Tom saying

Ill tell you when to look at it if he finds it

Wilson began to study Luigis palm tracing life lines heart lines head
lines and so on and noting carefully their relations with the cobweb of
finer and more delicate marks and lines that enmeshed them on all sides
he felt of the fleshy cushion at the base of the thumb and noted its
shape he felt of the fleshy side of the hand between the wrist and the
base of the little finger and noted its shape also he painstakingly
examined the fingers observing their form proportions and natural
manner of disposing themselves when in repose All this process was
watched by the three spectators with absorbing interest their heads bent
together over Luigis palm and nobody disturbing the stillness with a
word Wilson now entered upon a close survey of the palm again and his
revelations began

He mapped out Luigis character and disposition his tastes aversions
proclivities ambitions and eccentricities in a way which sometimes made
Luigi wince and the others laugh but both twins declared that the chart
was artistically drawn and was correct

Next Wilson took up Luigis history He proceeded cautiously and with
hesitation now moving his finger slowly along the great lines of the
palm and now and then halting it at a star or some such landmark and
examining that neighborhood minutely He proclaimed one or two past
events Luigi confirmed his correctness and the search went on
Presently Wilson glanced up suddenly with a surprised expression

Here is a record of an incident which you would perhaps not wish me
to

Bring it out said Luigi goodnaturedly I promise you shant
embarrass me

But Wilson still hesitated and did not seem quite to know what to do
Then he said

I think it is too delicate a matter totoI believe I would rather
write it or whisper it to you and let you decide for yourself whether
you want it talked out or not

That will answer said Luigi Write it

Wilson wrote something on a slip of paper and handed it to Luigi who
read it to himself and said to Tom

Unfold your slip and read it Mr Driscoll

Tom said

IT WAS PROPHESIED THAT I WOULD KILL A MAN IT CAME TRUE BEFORE THE
YEAR WAS OUT

Tom added Great Scott

Luigi handed Wilsons paper to Tom and said

Now read this one

Tom read

YOU HAVE KILLED SOMEONE BUT WHETHER MAN WOMAN OR CHILD I DO NOT
MAKE OUT

Caesars ghost commented Tom with astonishment It beats anything
that was ever heard of Why a mans own hand is his deadliest enemy
Just think of thata mans own hand keeps a record of the deepest and
fatalest secrets of his life and is treacherously ready to expose
himself to any blackmagic stranger that comes along But what do you
let a person look at your hand for with that awful thing printed on it

Oh said Luigi reposefully I dont mind it I killed the man for
good reasons and I dont regret it

What were the reasons

Well he needed killing

Ill tell you why he did it since he wont say himself said Angelo
warmly He did it to save my life thats what he did it for So it was
a noble act and not a thing to be hid in the dark

So it was so it was said Wilson To do such a thing to save a
brothers life is a great and fine action

Now come said Luigi it is very pleasant to hear you say these
things but for unselfishness or heroism or magnanimity the
circumstances wont stand scrutiny You overlook one detail suppose I
hadnt saved Angelos life what would have become of mine If I had let
the man kill him wouldnt he have killed me too I saved my own life
you see

Yes that is your way of talking said Angelo but I know youI
dont believe you thought of yourself at all I keep that weapon yet
that Luigi killed the man with and Ill show it to you sometime That
incident makes it interesting and it had a history before it came into
Luigis hands which adds to its interest It was given to Luigi by a
great Indian prince the Gaikowar of Baroda and it had been in his
family two or three centuries It killed a good many disagreeable people
who troubled the hearthstone at one time or another It isnt much too
look at except it isnt shaped like other knives or dirks or whatever
it may be calledhere Ill draw it for you He took a sheet of paper
and made a rapid sketch There it isa broad and murderous blade with
edges like a razor for sharpness The devices engraved on it are the
ciphers or names of its long line of possessorsI had Luigis name added
in Roman letters myself with our coat of arms as you see You notice
what a curious handle the thing has It is solid ivory polished like a
mirror and is four or five inches longround and as thick as a large
mans wrist with the end squared off flat for your thumb to rest on
for you grasp it with your thumb resting on the blunt endsoand lift
it along and strike downward The Gaikowar showed us how the thing was
done when he gave it to Luigi and before that night was ended Luigi had
used the knife and the Gaikowar was a man short by reason of it The
sheath is magnificently ornamented with gems of great value You will
find a sheath more worth looking at than the knife itself of course

Tom said to himself

Its lucky I came here I would have sold that knife for a song I
supposed the jewels were glass

But go on dont stop said Wilson Our curiosity is up now to hear
about the homicide Tell us about that

Well briefly the knife was to blame for that all around A native
servant slipped into our room in the palace in the night to kill us and
steal the knife on account of the fortune encrusted on its sheath
without a doubt Luigi had it under his pillow we were in bed together
There was a dim nightlight burning I was asleep but Luigi was awake
and he thought he detected a vague form nearing the bed He slipped the
knife out of the sheath and was ready and unembarrassed by hampering
bedclothes for the weather was hot and we hadnt any Suddenly that
native rose at the bedside and bent over me with his right hand lifted
and a dirk in it aimed at my throat but Luigi grabbed his wrist pulled
him downward and drove his own knife into the mans neck That is the
whole story

Wilson and Tom drew deep breaths and after some general chat about the
tragedy Puddnhead said taking Toms hand

Now Tom Ive never had a look at your palms as it happens perhaps
youve got some little questionable privacies that needhello

Tom had snatched away his hand and was looking a good deal confused

Why hes blushing said Luigi

Tom darted an ugly look at him and said sharply

Well if I am it aint because Im a murderer Luigis dark face
flushed but before he could speak or move Tom added with anxious haste
Oh I beg a thousand pardons I didnt mean that it was out before I
thought and Im very very sorryyou must forgive me

Wilson came to the rescue and smoothed things down as well as he could
and in fact was entirely successful as far as the twins were concerned
for they felt sorrier for the affront put upon him by his guests
outburst of ill manners than for the insult offered to Luigi But the
success was not so pronounced with the offender Tom tried to seem at
his ease and he went through the motions fairly well but at bottom he
felt resentful toward all the three witnesses of his exhibition in fact
he felt so annoyed at them for having witnessed it and noticed it that he
almost forgot to feel annoyed at himself for placing it before them
However something presently happened which made him almost comfortable
and brought him nearly back to a state of charity and friendliness This
was a little spat between the twins not much of a spat but still a
spat and before they got far with it they were in a decided condition
of irritation while pretending to be actuated by more respectable
motives By his help the fire got warmed up to the blazing point and he
might have had the happiness of seeing the flames show up in another
moment but for the interruption of a knock on the dooran interruption
which fretted him as much as it gratified Wilson Wilson opened the
door

The visitor was a goodnatured ignorant energetic middleaged Irishman
named John Buckstone who was a great politician in a small way and
always took a large share in public matters of every sort One of the
towns chief excitements just now was over the matter of rum There
was a strong rum party and a strong antirum party Buckstone was
training with the rum party and he had been sent to hunt up the twins
and invite them to attend a mass meeting of that faction He delivered
his errand and said the clans were already gathering in the big hall
over the market house Luigi accepted the invitation cordially Angelo
less cordially since he disliked crowds and did not drink the powerful
intoxicants of America In fact he was even a teetotaler sometimes
when it was judicious to be one

The twins left with Buckstone and Tom Driscoll joined the company with
them uninvited

In the distance one could see a long wavering line of torches drifting
down the main street and could hear the throbbing of the bass drum the
clash of cymbals the squeaking of a fife or two and the faint roar of
remote hurrahs The tail end of this procession was climbing the market
house stairs when the twins arrived in its neighborhood when they
reached the hall it was full of people torches smoke noise and
enthusiasm They were conducted to the platform by BuckstoneTom
Driscoll still followingand were delivered to the chairman in the midst
of a prodigious explosion of welcome When the noise had moderated a
little the chair proposed that our illustrious guests be at once
elected by complimentary acclamation to membership in our everglorious
organization the paradise of the free and the perdition of the slave

This eloquent discharge opened the floodgates of enthusiasm again and
the election was carried with thundering unanimity Then arose a storm
of cries

Wet them down Wet them down Give them a drink

Glasses of whisky were handed to the twins Luigi waves his aloft then
brought it to his lips but Angelo set his down There was another storm
of cries

Whats the matter with the other one What is the blond one going
back on us for Explain Explain

The chairman inquired and then reported

We have made an unfortunate mistake gentlemen I find that the Count
Angelo Capello is opposed to our creedis a teetotaler in fact and was
not intending to apply for membership with us He desires that we
reconsider the vote by which he was elected What is the pleasure of the
house

There was a general burst of laughter plentifully accented with
whistlings and catcalls but the energetic use of the gavel presently
restored something like order Then a man spoke from the crowd and said
that while he was very sorry that the mistake had been made it would not
be possible to rectify it at the present meeting According to the
bylaws it must go over to the next regular meeting for action He would
not offer a motion as none was required He desired to apologize to the
gentlemen in the name of the house and begged to assure him that as far
as it might lie in the power of the Sons of Liberty his temporary
membership in the order would be made pleasant to him

This speech was received with great applause mixed with cries of

Thats the talk Hes a good fellow anyway if he _is_ a teetotaler
Drink his health Give him a rouser and no heeltaps

Glasses were handed around and everybody on the platform drank Angelos
health while the house bellowed forth in song


 For hes a jolly good fellow
 For hes a jolly good fellow
 For hes a jolly good feellow
 Which nobody can deny

Tom Driscoll drank It was his second glass for he had drunk Angelos
the moment that Angelo had set it down The two drinks made him very
merryalmost idiotically so and he began to take a most lively and
prominent part in the proceedings particularly in the music and catcalls
and side remarks

The chairman was still standing at the front the twins at his side The
extraordinarily close resemblance of the brothers to each other suggested
a witticism to Tom Driscoll and just as the chairman began a speech he
skipped forward and said with an air of tipsy confidence to the
audience

Boys I move that he keeps still and lets this human philopena snip you
out a speech

The descriptive aptness of the phrase caught the house and a mighty
burst of laughter followed

Luigis southern blood leaped to the boiling point in a moment under the
sharp humiliation of this insult delivered in the presence of four
hundred strangers It was not in the young mans nature to let the
matter pass or to delay the squaring of the account He took a couple of
strides and halted behind the unsuspecting joker Then he drew back and
delivered a kick of such titanic vigor that it lifted Tom clear over the
footlights and landed him on the heads of the front row of the Sons of
Liberty

Even a sober person does not like to have a human being emptied on him
when he is not doing any harm a person who is not sober cannot endure
such an attention at all The nest of Sons of Liberty that Driscoll
landed in had not a sober bird in it in fact there was probably not an
entirely sober one in the auditorium Driscoll was promptly and
indignantly flung on the heads of Sons in the next row and these Sons
passed him on toward the rear and then immediately began to pummel the
front row Sons who had passed him to them This course was strictly
followed by bench after bench as Driscoll traveled in his tumultuous and
airy flight toward the door so he left behind him an everlengthening
wake of raging and plunging and fighting and swearing humanity Down went
group after group of torches and presently above the deafening clatter
of the gavel roar of angry voices and crash of succumbing benches rose
the paralyzing cry of _fire_

The fighting ceased instantly the cursing ceased for one distinctly
defined moment there was a dead hush a motionless calm where the
tempest had been then with one impulse the multitude awoke to life and
energy again and went surging and struggling and swaying this way and
that its outer edges melting away through windows and doors and
gradually lessening the pressure and relieving the mass

The fireboys were never on hand so suddenly before for there was no
distance to go this time their quarters being in the rear end of the
market house There was an engine company and a hookandladder company
Half of each was composed of rummies and the other half of antirummies
after the moral and political shareandsharealike fashion of the
frontier town of the period Enough antirummies were loafing in quarters
to man the engine and the ladders In two minutes they had their red
shirts and helmets onthey never stirred officially in unofficial
costumeand as the mass meeting overhead smashed through the long row of
windows and poured out upon the roof of the arcade the deliverers were
ready for them with a powerful stream of water which washed some of them
off the roof and nearly drowned the rest But water was preferable to
fire and still the stampede from the windows continued and still the
pitiless drenching assailed it until the building was empty then the
fireboys mounted to the hall and flooded it with water enough to
annihilate forty times as much fire as there was there for a village
fire company does not often get a chance to show off and so when it does
get a chance it makes the most of it Such citizens of that village as
were of a thoughtful and judicious temperament did not insure against
fire they insured against the fire company




CHAPTER 12  The Shame of Judge Driscoll

 _Courage is resistance to fear mastery of fearnot absence
 of fear Except a creature be part coward it is not a
 compliment to say it is brave it is merely a loose
 misapplication of the word Consider the fleaincomparably
 the bravest of all the creatures of God if ignorance of
 fear were courage Whether you are asleep or awake he will
 attack you caring nothing for the fact that in bulk and
 strength you are to him as are the massed armies of the
 earth to a sucking child he lives both day and night and
 all days and nights in the very lap of peril and the
 immediate presence of death and yet is no more afraid than
 is the man who walks the streets of a city that was
 threatened by an earthquake ten centuries before When we
 speak of Clive Nelson and Putnam as men who didnt know
 what fear was we ought always to add the fleaand put him
 at the head of the procession_ Puddnhead Wilsons
 Calendar


Judge Driscoll was in bed and asleep by ten oclock on Friday night and
he was up and gone afishing before daylight in the morning with his
friend Pembroke Howard These two had been boys together in Virginia
when that state still ranked as the chief and most imposing member of the
Union and they still coupled the proud and affectionate adjective old
with her name when they spoke of her In Missouri a recognized
superiority attached to any person who hailed from Old Virginia and this
superiority was exalted to supremacy when a person of such nativity could
also prove descent from the First Families of that great commonwealth
The Howards and Driscolls were of this aristocracy In their eyes it
was a nobility It had its unwritten laws and they were as clearly
defined and as strict as any that could be found among the printed
statutes of the land The FFV was born a gentleman his highest duty in
life was to watch over that great inheritance and keep it unsmirched He
must keep his honor spotless Those laws were his chart his course was
marked out on it if he swerved from it by so much as half a point of the
compass it meant shipwreck to his honor that is to say degradation
from his rank as a gentleman These laws required certain things of him
which his religion might forbid then his religion must yieldthe laws
could not be relaxed to accommodate religions or anything else Honor
stood first and the laws defined what it was and wherein it differed in
certain details from honor as defined by church creeds and by the social
laws and customs of some of the minor divisions of the globe that had got
crowded out when the sacred boundaries of Virginia were staked out

If Judge Driscoll was the recognized first citizen of Dawsons Landing
Pembroke Howard was easily its recognized second citizen He was called
the great lawyeran earned title He and Driscoll were of the same
agea year or two past sixty

Although Driscoll was a freethinker and Howard a strong and determined
Presbyterian their warm intimacy suffered no impairment in consequence
They were men whose opinions were their own property and not subject to
revision and amendment suggestion or criticism by anybody even their
friends

The days fishing finished they came floating downstream in their skiff
talking national politics and other high matters and presently met a
skiff coming up from town with a man in it who said

I reckon you know one of the new twins gave your nephew a kicking last
night Judge

Did WHAT

Gave him a kicking

The old judges lips paled and his eyes began to flame He choked with
anger for a moment then he got out what he was trying to say

Wellwellgo on Give me the details

The man did it At the finish the judge was silent a minute turning
over in his mind the shameful picture of Toms flight over the
footlights then he said as if musing aloud

HmI dont understand it I was asleep at home He didnt wake me
Thought he was competent to manage his affair without my help I reckon
His face lit up with pride and pleasure at that thought and he said with
a cheery complacency I like thatits the true old bloodhey
Pembroke

Howard smiled an iron smile and nodded his head approvingly Then the
newsbringer spoke again

But Tom beat the twin on the trial

The judge looked at the man wonderingly and said

The trial What trial

Why Tom had him up before Judge Robinson for assault and battery

The old man shrank suddenly together like one who has received a death
stroke Howard sprang for him as he sank forward in a swoon and took
him in his arms and bedded him on his back in the boat He sprinkled
water in his face and said to the startled visitor

Go nowdont let him come to and find you here You see what an
effect your heedless speech has had you ought to have been more
considerate than to blurt out such a cruel piece of slander as that

Im right down sorry I did it now Mr Howard and I wouldnt have done
it if I had thought but it aint slander its perfectly true just as I
told him

He rowed away Presently the old judge came out of his faint and looked
up piteously into the sympathetic face that was bent over him

Say it aint true Pembroke tell me it aint true he said in a weak
voice

There was nothing weak in the deep organ tones that responded

You know its a lie as well as I do old friend He is of the best
blood of the Old Dominion

God bless you for saying it said the old gentleman fervently Ah
Pembroke it was such a blow

Howard stayed by his friend and saw him home and entered the house with
him It was dark and past suppertime but the judge was not thinking
of supper he was eager to hear the slander refuted from headquarters
and as eager to have Howard hear it too Tom was sent for and he came
immediately He was bruised and lame and was not a happylooking
object His uncle made him sit down and said

We have been hearing about your adventure Tom with a handsome lie
added for embellishment Now pulverize that lie to dust What measures
have you taken How does the thing stand

Tom answered guilelessly It dont stand at all its all over I had
him up in court and beat him Puddnhead Wilson defended himfirst
case he ever had and lost it The judge fined the miserable hound five
dollars for the assault

Howard and the judge sprang to their feet with the opening sentence
why neither knew then they stood gazing vacantly at each other
Howard stood a moment then sat mournfully down without saying anything
The judges wrath began to kindle and he burst out

You cur You scum You vermin Do you mean to tell me that blood of
my race has suffered a blow and crawled to a court of law about it
Answer me

Toms head drooped and he answered with an eloquent silence His uncle
stared at him with a mixed expression of amazement and shame and
incredulity that was sorrowful to see At last he said

Which of the twins was it

Count Luigi

You have challenged him

Nno hesitated Tom turning pale

You will challenge him tonight Howard will carry it

Tom began to turn sick and to show it He turned his hat round and
round in his hand his uncle glowering blacker and blacker upon him as
the heavy seconds drifted by then at last he began to stammer and said
piteously

Oh please dont ask me to do it uncle He is a murderous devilI
never couldIIm afraid of him

Old Driscolls mouth opened and closed three times before he could get it
to perform its office then he stormed out

A coward in my family A Driscoll a coward Oh what have I done to
deserve this infamy He tottered to his secretary in the corner
repeated that lament again and again in heartbreaking tones and got out
of a drawer a paper which he slowly tore to bits scattering the bits
absently in his track as he walked up and down the room still grieving
and lamenting At last he said

There it is shreds and fragments once moremy will Once more you
have forced me to disinherit you you base son of a most noble father
Leave my sight Gobefore I spit on you

The young man did not tarry Then the judge turned to Howard

You will be my second old friend

Of course

There is pen and paper Draft the cartel and lose no time

The Count shall have it in his hands in fifteen minutes said Howard

Tom was very heavyhearted His appetite was gone with his property and
his selfrespect He went out the back way and wandered down the obscure
lane grieving and wondering if any course of future conduct however
discreet and carefully perfected and watched over could win back his
uncles favor and persuade him to reconstruct once more that generous
will which had just gone to ruin before his eyes He finally concluded
that it could He said to himself that he had accomplished this sort of
triumph once already and that what had been done once could be done
again He would set about it He would bend every energy to the task
and he would score that triumph once more cost what it might to his
convenience limit as it might his frivolous and libertyloving life

To begin he says to himself Ill square up with the proceeds of my
raid and then gambling has got to be stoppedand stopped short off
Its the worst vice Ive gotfrom my standpoint anyway because its
the one he can most easily find out through the impatience of my
creditors He thought it expensive to have to pay two hundred dollars to
them for me once Expensive_that_ Why it cost me the whole of his
fortunebut of course he never thought of that some people cant
think of any but their own side of a case If he had known how deep I am
in now the will would have gone to pot without waiting for a duel to
help Three hundred dollars Its a pile But hell never hear of it
Im thankful to say The minute Ive cleared it off Im safe and Ill
never touch a card again Anyway I wont while he lives I make oath to
that Im entering on my last reformI know ityes and Ill win but
after that if I ever slip again Im gone




CHAPTER 13  Tom Stares at Ruin

 _When I reflect upon the number of disagreeable people who I
 know have gone to a better world I am moved to lead a
 different life_ Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar

 _October This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to
 speculate in stocks in The others are July January
 September April November May March June December
 August and February_ Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


Thus mournfully communing with himself Tom moped along the lane past
Puddnhead Wilsons house and still on and on between fences enclosing
vacant country on each hand till he neared the haunted house then he
came moping back again with many sighs and heavy with trouble He sorely
wanted cheerful company Rowena His heart gave a bound at the thought
but the next thought quieted itthe detested twins would be there

He was on the inhabited side of Wilsons house and now as he approached
it he noticed that the sitting room was lighted This would do others
made him feel unwelcome sometimes but Wilson never failed in courtesy
toward him and a kindly courtesy does at least save ones feelings even
if it is not professing to stand for a welcome Wilson heard footsteps at
his threshold then the clearing of a throat

Its that fickletempered dissipated young goosepoor devil he find
friends pretty scarce today likely after the disgrace of carrying a
personal assault case into a lawcourt

A dejected knock Come in

Tom entered and dropped into a chair without saying anything Wilson
said kindly

Why my boy you look desolate Dont take it so hard Try and forget
you have been kicked

Oh dear said Tom wretchedly its not that Puddnheadits not
that Its a thousand times worse than thatoh yes a million times
worse

Why Tom what do you mean Has Rowena

Flung me _No_ but the old man has

Wilson said to himself Aha and thought of the mysterious girl in the
bedroom The Driscolls have been making discoveries Then he said
aloud gravely

Tom there are some kinds of dissipation which

Oh shucks this hasnt got anything to do with dissipation He wanted
me to challenge that derned Italian savage and I wouldnt do it

Yes of course he would do that said Wilson in a meditative
matterofcourse way but the thing that puzzled me was why he didnt
look to that last night for one thing and why he let you carry such a
matter into a court of law at all either before the duel or after it
Its no place for it It was not like him I couldnt understand it
How did it happen

It happened because he didnt know anything about it He was asleep
when I got home last night

And you didnt wake him Tom is that possible

Tom was not getting much comfort here He fidgeted a moment then said

I didnt choose to tell himthats all He was going afishing before
dawn with Pembroke Howard and if I got the twins into the common
calabooseand I thought sure I couldI never dreamed of their slipping
out on a paltry fine for such an outrageous offensewell once in the
calaboose they would be disgraced and uncle wouldnt want any duels with
that sort of characters and wouldnt allow any

Tom I am ashamed of you I dont see how you could treat your good old
uncle so I am a better friend of his than you are for if I had known
the circumstances I would have kept that case out of court until I got
word to him and let him have the gentlemans chance

You would exclaimed Tom with lively surprise And it your first
case And you know perfectly well there never would have _been_ any case
if he had got that chance dont you And youd have finished your days
a pauper nobody instead of being an actually launched and recognized
lawyer today And you would really have done that would you

Certainly

Tom looked at him a moment or two then shook his head sorrowfully and
said

I believe youupon my word I do I dont know why I do but I do
Puddnhead Wilson I think youre the biggest fool I ever saw

Thank you

Dont mention it

Well he has been requiring you to fight the Italian and you have
refused You degenerate remnant of an honorable line Im thoroughly
ashamed of you Tom

Oh thats nothing I dont care for anything now that the wills torn
up again

Tom tell me squarelydidnt he find any fault with you for anything
but those two thingscarrying the case into court and refusing to
fight

He watched the young fellows face narrowly but it was entirely
reposeful and so also was the voice that answered

No he didnt find any other fault with me If he had had any to find
he would have begun yesterday for he was just in the humor for it He
drove that jackpair around town and showed them the sights and when he
came home he couldnt find his fathers old silver watch that dont keep
time and he thinks so much of and couldnt remember what he did with it
three or four days ago when he saw it last and when I suggested that it
probably wasnt lost but stolen it put him in a regular passion and he
said I was a foolwhich convinced me without any trouble that that
was just what he was afraid _had_ happened himself but did not want to
believe it because lost things stand a better chance of being found
again than stolen ones

Wheew whistled Wilson Score another one the list

Another what

Another theft

Theft

Yes theft That watch isnt lost its stolen Theres been another
raid on the townand just the same old mysterious sort of thing that has
happened once before as you remember

You dont mean it

Its as sure as you are born Have you missed anything yourself

No That is I did miss a silver pencil case that Aunt Mary Pratt gave
me last birthday

Youll find it stolenthats what youll find

No I shant for when I suggested theft about the watch and got such a
rap I went and examined my room and the pencil case was missing but it
was only mislaid and I found it again

You are sure you missed nothing else

Well nothing of consequence I missed a small plain gold ring worth
two or three dollars but that will turn up Ill look again

In my opinion youll not find it Theres been a raid I tell you Come
_in_

Mr Justice Robinson entered followed by Buckstone and the town
constable Jim Blake They sat down and after some wandering and
aimless weatherconversation Wilson said

By the way Weve just added another to the list of thefts maybe two
Judge Driscolls old silver watch is gone and Tom here has missed a gold
ring

Well it is a bad business said the justice and gets worse the
further it goes The Hankses the Dobsons the Pilligrews the Ortons
the Grangers the Hales the Fullers the Holcombs in fact everybody
that lives around about Patsy Coopers had been robbed of little things
like trinkets and teaspoons and suchlike small valuables that are easily
carried off Its perfectly plain that the thief took advantage of the
reception at Patsy Coopers when all the neighbors were in her house and
all their niggers hanging around her fence for a look at the show to
raid the vacant houses undisturbed Patsy is miserable about it
miserable on account of the neighbors and particularly miserable on
account of her foreigners of course so miserable on their account that
she hasnt any room to worry about her own little losses

Its the same old raider said Wilson I suppose there isnt any
doubt about that

Constable Blake doesnt think so

No youre wrong there said Blake The other times it was a man
there was plenty of signs of that as we know in the profession though
we never got hands on him but this time its a woman

Wilson thought of the mysterious girl straight off She was always in
his mind now But she failed him again Blake continued

Shes a stoopshouldered old woman with a covered basket on her arm in
a black veil dressed in mourning I saw her going aboard the ferryboat
yesterday Lives in Illinois I reckon but I dont care where she
lives Im going to get hershe can make herself sure of that

What makes you think shes the thief

Well there aint any other for one thing and for another some nigger
draymen that happened to be driving along saw her coming out of or going
into houses and told me soand it just happens that they was _robbed_
every time

It was granted that this was plenty good enough circumstantial evidence
A pensive silence followed which lasted some moments then Wilson said

Theres one good thing anyway She cant either pawn or sell Count
Luigis costly Indian dagger

My said Tom Is _that_ gone

Yes

Well that was a haul But why cant she pawn it or sell it

Because when the twins went home from the Sons of Liberty meeting last
night news of the raid was sifting in from everywhere and Aunt Patsy
was in distress to know if they had lost anything They found that the
dagger was gone and they notified the police and pawnbrokers everywhere
It was a great haul yes but the old woman wont get anything out of it
because shell get caught

Did they offer a reward asked Buckstone

Yes five hundred dollars for the knife and five hundred more for the
thief

What a leatherheaded idea exclaimed the constable The thief dasnt
go near them nor send anybody Whoever goes is going to get himself
nabbed for their aint any pawnbroker thats going to lose the chance
to

If anybody had noticed Toms face at that time the graygreen color of
it might have provoked curiosity but nobody did He said to himself
Im gone I never can square up the rest of the plunder wont pawn or
sell for half of the bill Oh I know itIm gone Im goneand this
time its for good Oh this is awfulI dont know what to do nor
which way to turn

Softly softly said Wilson to Blake I planned their scheme for them
at midnight last night and it was all finished up shipshape by two this
morning Theyll get their dagger back and then Ill explain to you how
the thing was done

There were strong signs of a general curiosity and Buckstone said

Well you have whetted us up pretty sharp Wilson and Im free to say
that if you dont mind telling us in confidence

Oh Id as soon tell as not Buckstone but as long as the twins and I
agreed to say nothing about it we must let it stand so But you can take
my word for it you wont be kept waiting three days Somebody will apply
for that reward pretty promptly and Ill show you the thief and the
dagger both very soon afterward

The constable was disappointed and also perplexed He said

It may all beyes and I hope it will but Im blamed if I can see my
way through it Its too many for yours truly

The subject seemed about talked out Nobody seemed to have anything
further to offer After a silence the justice of the peace informed
Wilson that he and Buckstone and the constable had come as a committee
on the part of the Democratic party to ask him to run for mayorfor the
little town was about to become a city and the first charter election was
approaching It was the first attention which Wilson had ever received
at the hands of any party it was a sufficiently humble one but it was a
recognition of his debut into the towns life and activities at last it
was a step upward and he was deeply gratified He accepted and the
committee departed followed by young Tom




CHAPTER 14  Roxana Insists Upon Reform

 _The true Southern watermelon is a boon apart and not to be
 mentioned with commoner things It is chief of this worlds
 luxuries king by the grace of God over all the fruits of
 the earth When one has tasted it he knows what the angels
 eat It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took we know
 it because she repented_ Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


About the time that Wilson was bowing the committee out Pembroke Howard
was entering the next house to report He found the old judge sitting
grim and straight in his chair waiting

Well Howardthe news

The best in the world

Accepts does he and the light of battle gleamed joyously in the
Judges eye

Accepts Why he jumped at it

Did did he Now thats finethats very fine I like that When is
it to be

Now Straight off Tonight An admirable fellowadmirable

Admirable Hes a darling Why its an honor as well as a pleasure to
stand up before such a man Comeoff with you Go and arrange
everythingand give him my heartiest compliments A rare fellow indeed
an admirable fellow as you have said

Ill have him in the vacant stretch between Wilsons and the haunted
house within the hour and Ill bring my own pistols

Judge Driscoll began to walk the floor in a state of pleased excitement
but presently he stopped and began to thinkbegan to think of Tom
Twice he moved toward the secretary and twice he turned away again but
finally he said

This may be my last night in the worldI must not take the chance He
is worthless and unworthy but it is largely my fault He was entrusted
to me by my brother on his dying bed and I have indulged him to his
hurt instead of training him up severely and making a man of him I
have violated my trust and I must not add the sin of desertion to that
I have forgiven him once already and would subject him to a long and
hard trial before forgiving him again if I could live but I must not
run that risk No I must restore the will But if I survive the duel I
will hide it away and he will not know and I will not tell him until he
reforms and I see that his reformation is going to be permanent

He redrew the will and his ostensible nephew was heir to a fortune
again As he was finishing his task Tom wearied with another brooding
tramp entered the house and went tiptoeing past the sitting room door
He glanced in and hurried on for the sight of his uncle was nothing but
terrors for him tonight But his uncle was writing That was unusual at
this late hour What could he be writing A chill of anxiety settled
down upon Toms heart Did that writing concern him He was afraid so
He reflected that when ill luck begins it does not come in sprinkles
but in showers He said he would get a glimpse of that document or know
the reason why He heard someone coming and stepped out of sight and
hearing It was Pembroke Howard What could be hatching

Howard said with great satisfaction

Everythings right and ready Hes gone to the battleground with his
second and the surgeonalso with his brother Ive arranged it all with
WilsonWilsons his second We are to have three shots apiece

Good How is the moon

Bright as day nearly Perfect for the distancefifteen yards No
windnot a breath hot and still

All good all firstrate Here Pembroke read this and witness it

Pembroke read and witnessed the will then gave the old mans hand a
hearty shake and said

Now thats right Yorkbut I knew you would do it You couldnt leave
that poor chap to fight along without means or profession with certain
defeat before him and I knew you wouldnt for his fathers sake if not
for his own

For his dead fathers sake I couldnt I know for poor Percybut you
know what Percy was to me But mindTom is not to know of this unless I
fall tonight

I understand Ill keep the secret

The judge put the will away and the two started for the battleground In
another minute the will was in Toms hands His misery vanished his
feelings underwent a tremendous revulsion He put the will carefully back
in its place and spread his mouth and swung his hat once twice three
times around his head in imitation of three rousing huzzahs no sound
issuing from his lips He fell to communing with himself excitedly and
joyously but every now and then he let off another volley of dumb
hurrahs

He said to himself Ive got the fortune again but Ill not let on
that I know about it And this time Im going to hang on to it I take no
more risks Ill gamble no more Ill drink no more becausewell
because Ill not go where there is any of that sort of thing going on
again Its the sure way and the only sure way I might have thought of
that soonerwell yes if I had wanted to But nowdear me Ive had a
scare this time and Ill take no more chances Not a single chance
more Land I persuaded myself this evening that I could fetch him
around without any great amount of effort but Ive been getting more and
more heavyhearted and doubtful straight along ever since If he tells
me about this thing all right but if he doesnt I shant let on
Iwell Id like to tell Puddnhead Wilson butno Ill think about
that perhaps I wont He whirled off another dead huzzah and said
Im reformed and this time Ill stay so sure

He was about to close with a final grand silent demonstration when he
suddenly recollected that Wilson had put it out of his power to pawn or
sell the Indian knife and that he was once more in awful peril of
exposure by his creditors for that reason His joy collapsed utterly and
he turned away and moped toward the door moaning and lamenting over the
bitterness of his luck He dragged himself upstairs and brooded in his
room a long time disconsolate and forlorn with Luigis Indian knife for
a text At last he sighed and said

When I supposed these stones were glass and this ivory bone the thing
hadnt any interest for me because it hadnt any value and couldnt help
me out of my trouble But nowwhy now it is full of interest yes and
of a sort to break a bodys heart Its a bag of gold that has turned to
dirt and ashes in my hands It could save me and save me so easily and
yet Ive got to go to ruin Its like drowning with a life preserver in
my reach All the hard luck comes to me and all the good luck goes to
other peoplePuddnhead Wilson for instance even his career has got a
sort of a little start at last and what has he done to deserve it I
should like to know Yes he has opened his own road but he isnt
content with that but must block mine Its a sordid selfish world and
I wish I was out of it He allowed the light of the candle to play upon
the jewels of the sheath but the flashings and sparklings had no charm
for his eye they were only just so many pangs to his heart I must not
say anything to Roxy about this thing he said She is too daring She
would be for digging these stones out and selling them and thenwhy
she would be arrested and the stones traced and then The thought made
him quake and he hid the knife away trembling all over and glancing
furtively about like a criminal who fancies that the accuser is already
at hand

Should he try to sleep Oh no sleep was not for him his trouble was
too haunting too afflicting for that He must have somebody to mourn
with He would carry his despair to Roxy

He had heard several distant gunshots but that sort of thing was not
uncommon and they had made no impression upon him He went out at the
back door and turned westward He passed Wilsons house and proceeded
along the lane and presently saw several figures approaching Wilsons
place through the vacant lots These were the duelists returning from the
fight he thought he recognized them but as he had no desire for white
peoples company he stooped down behind the fence until they were out of
his way

Roxy was feeling fine She said

Whah was you child Warnt you in it

In what

In de duel

Duel Has there been a duel

Cose dey has De ole Jedge has ben havin a duel wid one o dem
twins

Great Scott Then he added to himself Thats what made him remake
the will he thought he might get killed and it softened him toward me
And thats what he and Howard were so busy about    Oh dear if the
twin had only killed him I should be out of my

What is you mumblin bout Chambers Whah was you Didnt you know dey
was gwine to be a duel

No I didnt The old man tried to get me to fight one with Count
Luigi but he didnt succeed so I reckon he concluded to patch up the
family honor himself

He laughed at the idea and went rambling on with a detailed account of
his talk with the judge and how shocked and ashamed the judge was to
find that he had a coward in his family He glanced up at last and got
a shock himself Roxanas bosom was heaving with suppressed passion and
she was glowering down upon him with measureless contempt written in her
face

En you refuse to fight a man dat kicked you stid o jumpin at de
chance En you aint got no mo feelin den to come en tell me dat
fetched sich a po lowdown ornery rabbit into de worl Pah it make me
sick Its de nigger in you dats what it is Thirtyone parts o you
is white en ony one part nigger en dat po little one part is yo
_soul_ Taint wuth savin taint wuth totin out on a shovel en
throwin en de gutter You has disgraced yo birth What would yo pa
think o you Its enough to make him turn in his grave

The last three sentences stung Tom into a fury and he said to himself
that if his father were only alive and in reach of assassination his
mother would soon find that he had a very clear notion of the size of his
indebtedness to that man and was willing to pay it up in full and would
do it too even at risk of his life but he kept this thought to himself
that was safest in his mothers present state

Whatever has come o yo Essex blood Dats what I cant understan
En it aint ony jist Essex blood dats in you not by a long
sightdeed it aint My greatgreatgreatgranfather en yo
greatgreatgreatgreatgranfather was Ole Capn John Smith de highest
blood dat Ole Virginny ever turned out en _his_ greatgreatgranmother
or somers along back dah was Pocahontas de Injun queen en her husbun
was a nigger king outen Africaen yit here you is a slinkin outen a
duel en disgracin our whole line like a ornery lowdown hound Yes its
de nigger in you

She sat down on her candle box and fell into a reverie Tom did not
disturb her he sometimes lacked prudence but it was not in
circumstances of this kind Roxanas storm went gradually down but it
died hard and even when it seemed to be quite gone it would now and
then break out in a distant rumble so to speak in the form of muttered
ejaculations One of these was Aint nigger enough in him to show in
his fingernails en dat takes mighty littleyit deys enough to pain
his soul

Presently she muttered Yassir enough to paint a whole thimbleful of
em At last her ramblings ceased altogether and her countenance began
to cleara welcome sight to Tom who had learned her moods and knew she
was on the threshold of good humor now He noticed that from time to time
she unconsciously carried her finger to the end of her nose He looked
closer and said

Why Mammy the end of your nose is skinned How did that come

She sent out the sort of wholehearted peal of laughter which God had
vouchsafed in its perfection to none but the happy angels in heaven and
the bruised and broken black slave on the earth and said

Dad fetch dat duel I ben in it myself

Gracious did a bullet do that

Yassir you bet it did

Well I declare Why how did that happen

Happened disaway I uz asettn here kinder dozin in de dark en

The woman gave a sniff of scorn

Nobodys accusin you

Did anybody else get hurt

Yes we all got hit cep de blon twin en de doctor en de seconds De

George said Tom to himself to come so near being out of my trouble
and miss it by an inch Oh dear dear he will live to find me out and
sell me to some nigger trader yetyes and he would do it in a minute
Then he said aloud in a grave tone

Mother we are in an awful fix

Roxana caught her breath with a spasm and said

Chile What you hit a body so sudden for like dat Whats ben en gone
en happen

Well theres one thing I didnt tell you When I wouldnt fight he
tore up the will again and

Roxanas face turned a dead white and she said

Now yous _done_done forever Dats de end Bofe un us is gwine to
starve to

Wait and hear me through cant you I reckon that when he resolved to
fight himself he thought he might get killed and not have a chance to
forgive me any more in this life so he made the will again and Ive
seen it and its all right But

Oh thank goodness den wes safe aginsafe en so what did you want
to come here en talk sich dreadful

Hold ON I tell you and let me finish The swag I gathered wont half
square me up and the first thing we know my creditorswell you know

Roxana dropped her chin and told her son to leave her aloneshe must
think this matter out Presently she said impressively

You got to go mighty keerful now I tell you En heres what you got to

answered

 Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


What a time of it Dawsons Landing was having All its life it had been
asleep but now it hardly got a chance for a nod so swiftly did big
events and crashing surprises come along in one anothers wake Friday
morning first glimpse of Real Nobility also grand reception at Aunt
Patsy Coopers also great robber raid Friday evening dramatic kicking
of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people
Saturday morning emergence as practicing lawyer of the longsubmerged
Puddnhead Wilson Saturday night duel between chief citizen and titled
stranger

The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put
together perhaps It was a glory to their town to have such a thing
happen there In their eyes the principals had reached the summit of
human honor Everybody paid homage to their names their praises were in
all mouths Even the duelists subordinates came in for a handsome share
of the public approbation wherefore Puddnhead Wilson was suddenly
become a man of consequence When asked to run for the mayoralty Saturday
night he was risking defeat but Sunday morning found him a made man and
his success assured

The twins were prodigiously great now the town took them to its bosom
with enthusiasm Day after day and night after night they went dining
and visiting from house to house making friends enlarging and
solidifying their popularity and charming and surprising all with their
musical prodigies and now and then heightening the effects with samples
of what they could do in other directions out of their stock of rare and
curious accomplishments They were so pleased that they gave the
regulation thirty days notice the required preparation for citizenship
and resolved to finish their days in this pleasant place That was the
climax The delighted community rose as one man and applauded and when
the twins were asked to stand for seats in the forthcoming aldermanic
board and consented the public contentment was rounded and complete

Tom Driscoll was not happy over these things they sunk deep and hurt
all the way down He hated the one twin for kicking him and the other
one for being the kickers brother

Now and then the people wondered why nothing was heard of the raider or
of the stolen knife or the other plunder but nobody was able to throw
any light on that matter Nearly a week had drifted by and still the
thing remained a vexed mystery

On Sunday Constable Blake and Puddnhead Wilson met on the street and
Tom Driscoll joined them in time to open their conversation for them He
said to Blake You are not looking well Blake you seem to be annoyed
about something Has anything gone wrong in the detective business I
believe you fairly and justifiably claim to have a pretty good reputation
in that line isnt it sowhich made Blake feel good and look it
but Tom added for a country detectivewhich made Blake feel the other
way and not only look it but betray it in his voice

Yes sir I _have_ got a reputation and its as good as anybodys in
the profession too country or no country

Oh I beg pardon I didnt mean any offense What I started out to ask
was only about the old woman that raided the townthe stoopshouldered
old woman you know that you said you were going to catch and I knew
you would too because you have the reputation of never boasting
andwell youyouve caught the old woman

Damn the old woman

Why sho you dont mean to say you havent caught her

No I havent caught her If anybody could have caught her I could
but nobody couldnt I dont care who he is

I am sorry real sorryfor your sake because when it gets around that
a detective has expressed himself confidently and then

Dont you worry thats alldont you worry and as for the town the
town neednt worry either Shes my meatmake yourself easy about that
Im on her track Ive got clues that

Thats good Now if you could get an old veteran detective down from
St Louis to help you find out what the clues mean and where they lead
to and then

Im plenty veteran enough myself and I dont need anybodys help Ill
have her inside of a weinside of a month That Ill swear to

Tom said carelessly

I suppose that will answeryes that will answer But I reckon she is
pretty old and old people dont often outlive the cautious pace of the
professional detective when he has got his clues together and is out on
his stillhunt

Blakes dull face flushed under this gibe but before he could set his
retort in order Tom had turned to Wilson and was saying with placid
indifference of manner and voice

Who got the reward Puddnhead

Wilson winced slightly and saw that his own turn was come

What reward

Why the reward for the thief and the other one for the knife

Wilson answeredand rather uncomfortably to judge by his hesitating
fashion of delivering himself

Well thewell in face nobody has claimed it yet

Tom seemed surprised

Why is that so

Wilson showed a trifle of irritation when he replied

Yes its so And what of it

Oh nothing Only I thought you had struck out a new idea and invented
a scheme that was going to revolutionize the timeworn and ineffectual
methods of the He stopped and turned to Blake who was happy now
that another had taken his place on the gridiron Blake didnt you
understand him to intimate that it wouldnt be necessary for you to hunt
the old woman down

BGeorge he said hed have thief and swag both inside of three days
he did by hokey and thats just about a week ago Why I said at the
time that no thief and no thiefs pal was going to try to pawn or sell a
thing where he knowed the pawnbroker could get both rewards by taking HIM
into camp _with_ the swag It was the blessedest idea that ever I
struck

Youd change your mind said Wilson with irritated bluntness if you
knew the entire scheme instead of only part of it

Well said the constable pensively I had the idea that it wouldnt
work and up to now Im right anyway

Very well then let it stand at that and give it a further show It
has worked at least as well as your own methods you perceive

The constable hadnt anything handy to hit back with so he discharged a
discontented sniff and said nothing

After the night that Wilson had partly revealed his scheme at his house
Tom had tried for several days to guess out the secret of the rest of it
but had failed Then it occurred to him to give Roxanas smarter head a
chance at it He made up a supposititious case and laid it before
her She thought it over and delivered her verdict upon it Tom said
to himself Shes hit it sure He thought he would test that verdict
now and watch Wilsons face so he said reflectively

Wilson youre not a foola fact of recent discovery Whatever your
scheme was it had sense in it Blakes opinion to the contrary
notwithstanding I dont ask you to reveal it but I will suppose a
casea case which you will answer as a starting point for the real thing
I am going to come at and thats all I want You offered five hundred
dollars for the knife and five hundred for the thief We will suppose
for arguments sake that the first reward is _advertised_ and the second
offered by _private letter_ to pawnbrokers and

Blake slapped his thigh and cried out

By Jackson hes got you Puddnhead Now why couldnt I or _any_ fool
have thought of that

Wilson said to himself Anybody with a reasonably good head would have
thought of it I am not surprised that Blake didnt detect it I am only
surprised that Tom did There is more to him than I supposed He said
nothing aloud and Tom went on

Very well The thief would not suspect that there was a trap and he
would bring or send the knife and say he bought it for a song or found
it in the road or something like that and try to collect the reward
and be arrestedwouldnt he

Yes said Wilson

I think so said Tom There cant be any doubt of it Have you ever
seen that knife

No

Has any friend of yours

Not that I know of

Well I begin to think I understand why your scheme failed

What do you mean Tom What are you driving at asked Wilson with a
dawning sense of discomfort

Why that there _isnt_ any such knife

Look here Wilson said Blake Tom Driscolls right for a thousand
dollarsif I had it

Wilsons blood warmed a little and he wondered if he had been played
upon by those strangers it certainly had something of that look But
what could they gain by it He threw out that suggestion Tom replied

Gain Oh nothing that you would value maybe But they are strangers
making their way in a new community Is it nothing to them to appear as
pets of an Oriental princeat no expense Is it nothing to them to be
able to dazzle this poor town with thousanddollar rewardsat no
expense Wilson there isnt any such knife or your scheme would have
fetched it to light Or if there is any such knife theyve got it yet
I believe myself that theyve seen such a knife for Angelo pictured it
out with his pencil too swiftly and handily for him to have been
inventing it and of course I cant swear that theyve never had it but
this Ill go bail forif they had it when they came to this town
theyve got it yet

Blake said

It looks mighty reasonable the way Tom puts it it most certainly
does

Tom responded turning to leave

You find the old woman Blake and if she cant furnish the knife go
and search the twins

Tom sauntered away Wilson felt a good deal depressed He hardly knew
what to think He was loath to withdraw his faith from the twins and
was resolved not to do it on the present indecisive evidence butwell
he would think and then decide how to act

Blake what do you think of this matter

Well Puddnhead Im bound to say I put it up the way Tom does They
hadnt the knife or if they had it theyve got it yet

The men parted Wilson said to himself

I believe they had it if it had been stolen the scheme would have
restored it that is certain And so I believe theyve got it

Tom had no purpose in his mind when he encountered those two men When he
began his talk he hoped to be able to gall them a little and get a trifle
of malicious entertainment out of it But when he left he left in great
spirits for he perceived that just by pure luck and no troublesome labor
he had accomplished several delightful things he had touched both men
on a raw spot and seen them squirm he had modified Wilsons sweetness
for the twins with one small bitter taste that he wouldnt be able to get
out of his mouth right away and best of all he had taken the hated
twins down a peg with the community for Blake would gossip around
freely after the manner of detectives and within a week the town would
be laughing at them in its sleeve for offering a gaudy reward for a
bauble which they either never possessed or hadnt lost Tom was very
well satisfied with himself

Toms behavior at home had been perfect during the entire week His uncle
and aunt had seen nothing like it before They could find no fault with
him anywhere

Saturday evening he said to the Judge

Ive had something preying on my mind uncle and as I am going away
and might never see you again I cant bear it any longer I made you
believe I was afraid to fight that Italian adventurer I had to get out
of it on some pretext or other and maybe I chose badly being taken
unawares but no honorable person could consent to meet him in the field
knowing what I knew about him

Indeed What was that

Count Luigi is a confessed assassin

Incredible

Its perfectly true Wilson detected it in his hand by palmistry and
charged him with it and cornered him up so close that he had to confess
but both twins begged us on their knees to keep the secret and swore
they would lead straight lives here and it was all so pitiful that we
gave our word of honor never to expose them while they kept the promise
You would have done it yourself uncle

You are right my boy I would A mans secret is still his own
property and sacred when it has been surprised out of him like that
You did well and I am proud of you Then he added mournfully But I
wish I could have been saved the shame of meeting an assassin on the
field of honor

It couldnt be helped uncle If I had known you were going to
challenge him I should have felt obliged to sacrifice my pledged word in
order to stop it but Wilson couldnt be expected to do otherwise than
keep silent

Oh no Wilson did right and is in no way to blame Tom Tom you have
lifted a heavy load from my heart I was stung to the very soul when I
seemed to have discovered that I had a coward in my family

You may imagine what it cost ME to assume such a part uncle

Oh I know it poor boy I know it And I can understand how much it
has cost you to remain under that unjust stigma to this time But it is
all right now and no harm is done You have restored my comfort of
mind and with it your own and both of us had suffered enough

The old man sat awhile plunged in thought then he looked up with a
satisfied light in his eye and said That this assassin should have
put the affront upon me of letting me meet him on the field of honor as
if he were a gentleman is a matter which I will presently settlebut not
now I will not shoot him until after election I see a way to ruin them
both before I will attend to that first Neither of them shall be
elected that I promise You are sure that the fact that he is an
assassin has not got abroad

Perfectly certain of it sir

It will be a good card I will fling a hint at it from the stump on the
polling day It will sweep the ground from under both of them

Theres not a doubt of it It will finish them

That and outside work among the voters will to a certainty I want you
to come down here by and by and work privately among the ragtag and
bobtail You shall spend money among them I will furnish it

Another point scored against the detested twins Really it was a great
day for Tom He was encouraged to chance a parting shot now at the
same target and did it

You know that wonderful Indian knife that the twins have been making
such a todo about Well theres no track or trace of it yet so the
town is beginning to sneer and gossip and laugh Half the people believe
they never had any such knife the other half believe they had it and
have got it still Ive heard twenty people talking like that today

Yes Toms blemishless week had restored him to the favor of his aunt and
uncle

His mother was satisfied with him too Privately she believed she was
coming to love him but she did not say so She told him to go along to
St Louis now and she would get ready and follow Then she smashed her
whisky bottle and said

Dah now Is agwine to make you walk as straight as a string
Chambers en so Is bown you aint gwine to git no bad example out o
yo mammy I tole you you couldnt go into no bad compny Well yous
gwine into my compny en Is gwine to fill de bill Now den trot
along trot along

Tom went aboard one of the big transient boats that night with his heavy
satchel of miscellaneous plunder and slept the sleep of the unjust
which is serener and sounder than the other kind as we know by the
hangingeve history of a million rascals But when he got up in the
morning luck was against him again a brother thief had robbed him while
he slept and gone ashore at some intermediate landing

When Roxana arrived she found her son in such despair and misery that
her heart was touched and her motherhood rose up strong in her He was
ruined past hope now his destruction would be immediate and sure and he
would be an outcast and friendless That was reason enough for a mother
to love a child so she loved him and told him so It made him wince
secretlyfor she was a nigger That he was one himself was far from
reconciling him to that despised race

Roxana poured out endearments upon him to which he responded
uncomfortably but as well as he could And she tried to comfort him but
that was not possible These intimacies quickly became horrible to him
and within the hour he began to try to get up courage enough to tell her
so and require that they be discontinued or very considerably modified
But he was afraid of her and besides there came a lull now for she had
begun to think She was trying to invent a saving plan Finally she
started up and said she had found a way out Tom was almost suffocated
by the joy of this sudden good news Roxana said

Here is de plan en shell win sure Is a nigger en nobody aint
gwine to doubt it dat hears me talk Is wuth six hundd dollahs Take
en sell me en pay off dese gamblers

Tom was dazed He was not sure he had heard aright He was dumb for a
moment then he said

Do you mean that you would be sold into slavery to save me

Aint you my chile En does you know anything dat a mother wont do for
her chile Day aint nothin a white mother wont do for her chile Who
made em so De Lord done it En who made de niggers De Lord made em
In de inside mothers is all de same De good lord he made em so Is
gwine to be sole into slavery en in a year yous gwine to buy yo ole
mammy free agin Ill show you how Dats de plan

Toms hopes began to rise and his spirits along with them He said

Its lovely of you Mammyits just

Say it agin En keep on sayin it Its all de pay a body kin want in
dis worl en its mo den enough Laws bless you honey when Is slav
aroun en dey buses me if I knows yous asayin dat way off yonder
somers itll heal up all de sore places en I kin stan em

I DO say it again Mammy and Ill keep on saying it too But how am I
going to sell you Youre free you know

Much diffrence dat make White folks aint particlar De law kin sell
me now if dey tell me to leave de state in six months en I dont go You
draw up a paperbill o saleen put it way off yonder down in de
middle o Kaintuck somers en sign some names to it en say youll sell
me cheap case yous hard up youll find you aint gwine to have no
trouble You take me up de country a piece en sell me on a farm dem
people aint gwine to ask no questions if Is a bargain

Tom forged a bill of sale and sold his mother to an Arkansas cotton
planter for a trifle over six hundred dollars He did not want to commit
this treachery but luck threw the man in his way and this saved him the
necessity of going upcountry to hunt up a purchaser with the added risk
of having to answer a lot of questions whereas this planter was so
pleased with Roxy that he asked next to none at all Besides the
planter insisted that Roxy wouldnt know where she was at first and
that by the time she found out she would already have been contented

So Tom argued with himself that it was an immense advantaged for Roxy to
have a master who was pleased with her as this planter manifestly was
In almost no time his flowing reasonings carried him to the point of even
half believing he was doing Roxy a splendid surreptitious service in
selling her down the river And then he kept diligently saying to
himself all the time Its for only a year In a year I buy her free
again shell keep that in mind and itll reconcile her Yes the
little deception could do no harm and everything would come out right
and pleasant in the end anyway By agreement the conversation in
Roxys presence was all about the mans upcountry farm and how
pleasant a place it was and how happy the slaves were there so poor
Roxy was entirely deceived and easily for she was not dreaming that her
own son could be guilty of treason to a mother who in voluntarily going
into slaveryslavery of any kind mild or severe or of any duration
brief or longwas making a sacrifice for him compared with which death
would have been a poor and commonplace one She lavished tears and
loving caresses upon him privately and then went away with her owner
went away brokenhearted and yet proud to do it

Tom scored his accounts and resolved to keep to the very letter of his
reform and never to put that will in jeopardy again He had three
hundred dollars left According to his mothers plan he was to put that
safely away and add her half of his pension to it monthly In one year
this fund would buy her free again

For a whole week he was not able to sleep well so much the villainy
which he had played upon his trusting mother preyed upon his rag of
conscience but after that he began to get comfortable again and was
presently able to sleep like any other miscreant

The boat bore Roxy away from St Louis at four in the afternoon and she
stood on the lower guard abaft the paddle box and watched Tom through a
blur of tears until he melted into the throng of people and disappeared
then she looked no more but sat there on a coil of cable crying till far
into the night When she went to her foul steerage bunk at last between
the clashing engines it was not to sleep but only to wait for the
morning and waiting grieve

It had been imagined that she would not know and would think she was
traveling upstream She Why she had been steamboating for years At
dawn she got up and went listlessly and sat down on the cable coil again
She passed many a snag whose break could have told her a thing to break
her heart for it showed a current moving in the same direction that the
boat was going but her thoughts were elsewhere and she did not notice
But at last the roar of a bigger and nearer break than usual brought her
out of her torpor and she looked up and her practiced eye fell upon
that telltale rush of water For one moment her petrified gaze fixed
itself there Then her head dropped upon her breast and she said

Oh de good Lord God have mercy on po sinful meIS SOLE DOWN DE
RIVER

 Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


The summer weeks dragged by and then the political campaign opened
opened in pretty warm fashion and waxed hotter and hotter daily The
twins threw themselves into it with their whole heart for their
selflove was engaged Their popularity so general at first had
suffered afterward mainly because they had been TOO popular and so a
natural reaction had followed Besides it had been diligently whispered
around that it was curiousindeed VERY curiousthat that wonderful
knife of theirs did not turn upIF it was so valuable or IF it had ever
existed And with the whisperings went chucklings and nudgings and winks
and such things have an effect The twins considered that success in the
election would reinstate them and that defeat would work them
irreparable damage Therefore they worked hard but not harder than
Judge Driscoll and Tom worked against them in the closing days of the
canvass Toms conduct had remained so letterperfect during two whole
months now that his uncle not only trusted him with money with which to
persuade voters but trusted him to go and get it himself out of the safe
in the private sitting room

The closing speech of the campaign was made by Judge Driscoll and he
made it against both of the foreigners It was disastrously effective
He poured out rivers of ridicule upon them and forced the big mass
meeting to laugh and applaud He scoffed at them as adventurers
mountebanks sideshow riffraff dime museum freaks he assailed their
showy titles with measureless derision he said they were backalley
barbers disguised as nobilities peanut peddlers masquerading as
gentlemen organgrinders bereft of their brother monkey At last he
stopped and stood still He waited until the place had become absolutely
silent and expectant then he delivered his deadliest shot delivered it
with icecold seriousness and deliberation with a significant emphasis
upon the closing words he said he believed that the reward offered for
the lost knife was humbug and bunkum and that its owner would know where
to find it whenever he should have occasion TO ASSASSINATE SOMEBODY

Then he stepped from the stand leaving a startled and impressive hush
behind him instead of the customary explosion of cheers and party cries

The strange remark flew far and wide over the town and made an
extraordinary sensation Everybody was asking What could he mean by
that And everybody went on asking that question but in vain for the
judge only said he knew what he was talking about and stopped there Tom
said he hadnt any idea what his uncle meant and Wilson whenever he was
asked what he thought it meant parried the question by asking the
questioner what HE thought it meant

Wilson was elected the twins were defeatedcrushed in fact and left
forlorn and substantially friendless Tom went back to St Louis happy

Dawsons Landing had a week of repose now and it needed it But it was
in an expectant state for the air was full of rumors of a new duel
Judge Driscolls election labors had prostrated him but it was said that
as soon as he was well enough to entertain a challenge he would get one
from Count Luigi

The brothers withdrew entirely from society and nursed their humiliation
in privacy They avoided the people and went out for exercise only late
at night when the streets were deserted

The Friday after the election was a rainy one in St Louis It rained
all day long and rained hard apparently trying its best to wash that
sootblackened town white but of course not succeeding Toward midnight
Tom Driscoll arrived at his lodgings from the theater in the heavy
downpour and closed his umbrella and let himself in but when he would
have shut the door he found that there was another person
enteringdoubtless another lodger this person closed the door and
tramped upstairs behind Tom Tom found his door in the dark and entered
it and turned up the gas When he faced about lightly whistling he
saw the back of a man The man was closing and locking his door from
him His whistle faded out and he felt uneasy The man turned around a
wreck of shabby old clothes sodden with rain and all adrip and showed
a black face under an old slouch hat Tom was frightened He tried to
order the man out but the words refused to come and the other man got
the start He said in a low voice

Keep stillIs yo mother

Tom sunk in a heap on a chair and gasped out

It was mean of me and baseI know it but I meant it for the best I
did indeedI can swear it

Roxana stood awhile looking mutely down on him while he writhed in shame
and went on incoherently babbling selfaccusations mixed with pitiful
attempts at explanation and palliation of his crime then she seated
herself and took off her hat and her unkept masses of long brown hair
tumbled down about her shoulders

It warnt no fault o yon dat dat aint gray she said sadly noticing
the hair

I know it I know it Im a scoundrel But I swear I meant it for the
best It was a mistake of course but I thought it was for the best I
truly did

Roxana began to cry softly and presently words began to find their way
out between her sobs They were uttered lamentingly rather than
angrily

Sell a pusson down de riverDOWN DE RIVERfor de bes I wouldnt
treat a dog so I is all broke down en wore out now en so I reckon
it aint in me to storm aroun no mo like I used to when I uz trompled
on en bused I dont knowbut maybe its so Leastways Is suffered
so much dat mournin seem to come mo handy to me now den stormin

These words should have touched Tom Driscoll but if they did that
effect was obliterated by a stronger oneone which removed the heavy
weight of fear which lay upon him and gave his crushed spirit a most
grateful rebound and filled all his small soul with a deep sense of
relief But he kept prudently still and ventured no comment There was
a voiceless interval of some duration now in which no sounds were heard
but the beating of the rain upon the panes the sighing and complaining
of the winds and now and then a muffled sob from Roxana The sobs became
more and more infrequent and at last ceased Then the refugee began to
talk again

Shet down dat light a little More More yit A pusson dat is hunted
dont like de light Dahdatll do I kin see whah you is en dats
enough Is gwine to tell you de tale en cut it jes as short as I kin
en den Ill tell you what yous got to do Dat man dat bought me aint a
bad man hes good enough as planters goes en if he could a had his
way Id a ben a house servant in his fambly en ben comfortable but
his wife she was a Yank en not right down good lookin en she riz up
agin me straight off so den dey sent me out to de quarter mongst de
common fiel hans Dat woman warnt satisfied even wid dat but she
worked up de overseer agin me she uz dat jealous en hateful so de
overseer he had me out befo day in de mawnins en worked me de whole

Long at fust my marster say de good word for me to de overseer but dat
uz bad for me for de mistis she fine it out en arter dat I jist
ketched it at every turndey warnt no mercy for me no mo

Toms heart was firedwith fury against the planters wife and he said
to himself But for that meddlesome fool everything would have gone all
right He added a deep and bitter curse against her

The expression of this sentiment was fiercely written in his face and
stood thus revealed to Roxana by a white glare of lightning which turned
the somber dusk of the room into dazzling day at that moment She was
pleasedpleased and grateful for did not that expression show that her
child was capable of grieving for his mothers wrongs and of feeling
resentment toward her persecutorsa thing which she had been doubting
But her flash of happiness was only a flash and went out again and left
her spirit dark for she said to herself He sole me down de riverhe
cant feel for a body long disll pass en go Then she took up her tale
again

Bout ten days ago I uz sayin to myself dat I couldnt las many mo
weeks I uz so wore out wid de awful work en de lashins en so
downhearted en misable En I didnt care no mo nutherlife warnt
wuth nothn to me if I got to go on like dat Well when a body is in

Tom had been gradually sinking into a state of ghastly terror and he
said to himself now Im lost no matter what turn things take This
man has said to me that he thinks there was something suspicious about
that sale he said he had a letter from a passenger on the GRAND MOGUL
saying that Roxy came here on that boat and that everybody on board knew
all about the case so he says that her coming here instead of flying to
a free state looks bad for me and that if I dont find her for him and
that pretty soon he will make trouble for me I never believed that
story I couldnt believe she would be so dead to all motherly instincts
as to come here knowing the risk she would run of getting me into
irremediable trouble And after all here she is And I stupidly swore
I would help find her thinking it was a perfectly safe thing to promise
If I venture to deliver her up sheshebut how can I help myself
Ive got to do that or pay the money and wheres the money to come from
IIwell I should think that if he would swear to treat her kindly
hereafterand she says herself that he is a good manand if he would
swear to never allow her to be overworked or ill fed or

A flash of lightning exposed Toms pallid face drawn and rigid with
these worrying thoughts Roxana spoke up sharply now and there was
apprehension in her voice

Turn up dat light I want to see yo face better Dah nowlemme look
at you Chambers yous as white as yo shirt Has you see dat man Has
he ben to see you

Yes

When

Monday noon

Monday noon Was he on my track

Hewell he thought he was That is he hoped he was This is the bill
you saw He took it out of his pocket

Read it to me

She was panting with excitement and there was a dusky glow in her eyes
that Tom could not translate with certainty but there seemed to be
something threatening about it The handbill had the usual rude woodcut
of a turbaned Negro woman running with the customary bundle on a stick
over her shoulder and the heading in bold type 100 REWARD Tom read
the bill aloudat least the part that described Roxana and named the
master and his St Louis address and the address of the Fourth street
agency but he left out the item that applicants for the reward might
also apply to Mr Thomas Driscoll

Gimme de bill

Tom had folded it and was putting it in his pocket He felt a chilly
streak creeping down his back but said as carelessly as he could

The bill Why it isnt any use to you you cant read it What do you
want with it

Gimme de bill Tom gave it to her but with a reluctance which he
could not entirely disguise Did you read it ALL to me

Certainly I did

Hole up yo han en swah to it

Tom did it Roxana put the bill carefully away in her pocket with her
eyes fixed upon Toms face all the while then she said

Yos lyin

What would I want to lie about it for

I dont knowbut you is Dats my opinion anyways But nemmine bout
dat When I seed dat man I uz dat skyerd dat I could scacely wobble
home Den I give a nigger man a dollar for dese cloes en I aint bein
in a house sence night ner day till now I blacked my face en laid hid
in de cellar of a ole house dats burnt down daytimes en robbed de

never dast to come near dis place till dis rainy night when dey aint no
people roun scacely But tonight I ben astanin in de dark alley

She fell to thinking Presently she said

You seed dat man at noon las Monday

Yes

I seed him de middle o dat arternoon He hunted you up didnt he

Yes

Did he give you de bill dat time

No he hadnt got it printed yet

Roxana darted a suspicious glance at him

Did you hep him fix up de bill

Tom cursed himself for making that stupid blunder and tried to rectify
it by saying he remembered now that it WAS at noon Monday that the man
gave him the bill Roxana said

Yous lyin agin sho Then she straightened up and raised her
finger

Now den Is gwine to ask you a question en I wants to know how yous
gwine to git aroun it You knowed he uz arter me en if you run off
stid o stayin here to hep him hed know dey uz somethin wrong

tar up de will en kick you outen de house Now den you answer me dis
question haint you tole dat man dat I would be sho to come here en
den you would fix it so he could set a trap en ketch me

Tom recognized that neither lies nor arguments could help him any
longerhe was in a vise with the screw turned on and out of it there
was no budging His face began to take on an ugly look and presently he
said with a snarl

Well what could I do You see yourself that I was in his grip and
couldnt get out

Roxy scorched him with a scornful gaze awhile then she said

What could you do You could be Judas to yo own mother to save yo
wuthless hide Would anybody blieve it Noa dog couldnt You is de
lowdownest orneriest hound dat was ever pupd into dis worlen Is
sponsible for itand she spat on him

He made no effort to resent this Roxy reflected a moment then she
said

Now Ill tell you what yous gwine to do Yous gwine to give dat man
de money dat yous got laid up en make him wait till you kin go to de
judge en git de res en buy me free agin

Thunder What are you thinking of Go and ask him for three hundred
dollars and odd What would I tell him I want it for pray

Roxys answer was delivered in a serene and level voice

Youll tell him yous sole me to pay yo gamblin debts en dat you lied
to me en was a villain en dat I quires you to git dat money en buy me
back agin

Why youve gone stark mad He would tear the will to shreds in a
minutedont you know that

Then you dont believe Im idiot enough to go to him do you

I dont blieve nothin bout itI KNOWS yous agoin I knows it
case you knows dat if you dont raise dat money Ill go to him myself
en den hell sell YOU down de river en you kin see how you like it

Tom rose trembling and excited and there was an evil light in his eye
He strode to the door and said he must get out of this suffocating place
for a moment and clear his brain in the fresh air so that he could
determine what to do The door wouldnt open Roxy smiled grimly and
said

Is got the key honeyset down You neednt cler up yo brain none
to fine out what you gwine to do_I_ knows what yous gwine to do Tom
sat down and began to pass his hands through his hair with a helpless and
desperate air Roxy said Is dat man in dis house

Tom glanced up with a surprised expression and asked

What gave you such an idea

You done it Gwine out to cler yo brain In de fust place you aint
got none to cler en in de second place yo ornery eye tole on you
Yous de lowdownest hound dat everbut I done told you dat befo Now

Tom answered sullenly Yes

hes to keep it tell I come You understan

Yes

Dats all den Take yo umbreller en put on yo hat

Chambers does you blieve me when I says dat

Its no use to bother me with that question I know your words good

Yes its diffrent from yon Shet de light out en move alongheres
de key

They were not followed Tom trembled every time a late straggler brushed
by them on the street and half expected to feel the cold steel in his
back Roxy was right at his heels and always in reach After tramping a
mile they reached a wide vacancy on the deserted wharves and in this
dark and rainy desert they parted

As Tom trudged home his mind was full of dreary thoughts and wild plans
but at last he said to himself wearily

There is but the one way out I must follow her plan But with a
variationI will not ask for the money and ruin myself I will ROB the
old skinflint




CHAPTER 19  The Prophesy Realized

 _Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of
 a good example_ Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar

 _It were not best that we should all think alike it is
 difference of opinion that makes horse races_ Puddnhead
 Wilsons Calendar


Dawsons Landing was comfortably finishing its season of dull repose and
waiting patiently for the duel Count Luigi was waiting too but not
patiently rumor said Sunday came and Luigi insisted on having his
challenge conveyed Wilson carried it Judge Driscoll declined to fight
with an assassinthat is he added significantly in the field of
honor

Elsewhere of course he would be ready Wilson tried to convince him
that if he had been present himself when Angelo told him about the
homicide committed by Luigi he would not have considered the act
discreditable to Luigi but the obstinate old man was not to be moved

Wilson went back to his principal and reported the failure of his
mission Luigi was incensed and asked how it could be that the old
gentleman who was by no means dullwitted held his trifling nephews
evidence in inferences to be of more value than Wilsons But Wilson
laughed and said

That is quite simple that is easily explicable I am not his dollhis
babyhis infatuation his nature is The judge and his late wife never
had any children The judge and his wife were past middle age when this
treasure fell into their lap One must make allowances for a parental
instinct that has been starving for twentyfive or thirty years It is
famished it is crazed with hunger by that time and will be entirely
satisfied with anything that comes handy its taste is atrophied it
cant tell mud cat from shad A devil born to a young couple is
measurably recognizable by them as a devil before long but a devil
adopted by an old couple is an angel to them and remains so through
thick and thin Tom is this old mans angel he is infatuated with him
Tom can persuade him into things which other people cantnot all
things I dont mean that but a good manyparticularly one class of
things the things that create or abolish personal partialities or
prejudices in the old mans mind The old man liked both of you Tom
conceived a hatred for you That was enough it turned the old man
around at once The oldest and strongest friendship must go to the ground
when one of these lateadopted darlings throws a brick at it

Its a curious philosophy said Luigi

It aint philosophy at allits a fact And there is something
pathetic and beautiful about it too I think there is nothing more
pathetic than to see one of these poor old childless couples taking a
menagerie of yelping little worthless dogs to their hearts and then
adding some cursing and squawking parrots and a jackassvoiced macaw and
next a couple of hundred screeching songbirds and presently some fetid
guinea pigs and rabbits and a howling colony of cats It is all a
groping and ignorant effort to construct out of base metal and brass
filings so to speak something to take the place of that golden treasure
denied them by Nature a child But this is a digression The unwritten
law of this region requires you to kill Judge Driscoll on sight and he
and the community will expect that attention at your handsthough of
course your own death by his bullet will answer every purpose Look out
for him Are you healedthat is fixed

Yes he shall have his opportunity If he attacks me I will respond

As Wilson was leaving he said

The judge is still a little used up by his campaign work and will not
get out for a day or so but when he does get out you want to be on the
alert

About eleven at night the twins went out for exercise and started on a
long stroll in the veiled moonlight

Tom Driscoll had landed at Hacketts Store two miles below Dawsons
just about half an hour earlier the only passenger for that lonely spot
and had walked up the shore road and entered Judge Driscolls house
without having encountered anyone either on the road or under the roof

He pulled down his window blinds and lighted his candle He laid off his
coat and hat and began his preparations He unlocked his trunk and got
his suit of girls clothes out from under the male attire in it and laid
it by Then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork in his
pocket His plan was to slip down to his uncles private sitting room
below pass into the bedroom steal the safe key from the old gentlemans
clothes and then go back and rob the safe He took up his candle to
start His courage and confidence were high up to this point but both
began to waver a little now Suppose he should make a noise by some
accident and get caughtsay in the act of opening the safe Perhaps
it would be well to go armed He took the Indian knife from its hiding
place and felt a pleasant return of his wandering courage He slipped
stealthily down the narrow stair his hair rising and his pulses halting
at the slightest creak When he was halfway down he was disturbed to
perceive that the landing below was touched by a faint glow of light
What could that mean Was his uncle still up No that was not likely
he must have left his night taper there when he went to bed Tom crept
on down pausing at every step to listen He found the door standing
open and glanced in What he saw pleased him beyond measure His uncle
was asleep on the sofa on a small table at the head of the sofa a lamp
was burning low and by it stood the old mans small cashbox closed
Near the box was a pile of bank notes and a piece of paper covered with
figures in pencil The safe door was not open Evidently the sleeper had
wearied himself with work upon his finances and was taking a rest

Tom set his candle on the stairs and began to make his way toward the
pile of notes stooping low as he went When he was passing his uncle
the old man stirred in his sleep and Tom stopped instantlystopped and
softly drew the knife from its sheath with his heart thumping and his
eyes fastened upon his benefactors face After a moment or two he
ventured forward againone stepreached for his prize and seized it
dropping the knife sheath Then he felt the old mans strong grip upon
him and a wild cry of Help help rang in his ear Without hesitation
he drove the knife homeand was free Some of the notes escaped from his
left hand and fell in the blood on the floor He dropped the knife and
snatched them up and started to fly transferred them to his left hand
and seized the knife again in his fright and confusion but remembered
himself and flung it from him as being a dangerous witness to carry away
with him

He jumped for the stairfoot and closed the door behind him and as he
snatched his candle and fled upward the stillness of the night was
broken by the sound of urgent footsteps approaching the house In another
moment he was in his room and the twins were standing aghast over the
body of the murdered man

Tom put on his coat buttoned his hat under it threw on his suit of
girls clothes dropped the veil blew out his light locked the room
door by which he had just entered taking the key passed through his
other door into the black hall locked that door and kept the key then
worked his way along in the dark and descended the black stairs He was
not expecting to meet anybody for all interest was centered in the other
part of the house now his calculation proved correct By the time he
was passing through the backyard Mrs Pratt her servants and a dozen
halfdressed neighbors had joined the twins and the dead and accessions
were still arriving at the front door

As Tom quaking as with a palsy passed out at the gate three women came
flying from the house on the opposite side of the lane They rushed by
him and in at the gate asking him what the trouble was there but not
waiting for an answer Tom said to himself Those old maids waited to
dressthey did the same thing the night Stevenss house burned down next
door In a few minutes he was in the haunted house He lighted a candle
and took off his girlclothes There was blood on him all down his left
side and his right hand was red with the stains of the bloodsoaked
notes which he has crushed in it but otherwise he was free from this
sort of evidence He cleansed his hand on the straw and cleaned most of
the smut from his face Then he burned the male and female attire to
ashes scattered the ashes and put on a disguise proper for a tramp He
blew out his light went below and was soon loafing down the river road
with the intent to borrow and use one of Roxys devices He found a
canoe and paddled down downstream setting the canoe adrift as dawn
approached and making his way by land to the next village where he kept
out of sight till a transient steamer came along and then took deck
passage for St Louis He was ill at ease until Dawsons Landing was behind
him then he said to himself All the detectives on earth couldnt trace
me now theres not a vestige of a clue left in the world that homicide
will take its place with the permanent mysteries and people wont get
done trying to guess out the secret of it for fifty years

In St Louis next morning he read this brief telegram in the
papersdated at Dawsons Landing

 Judge Driscoll an old and respected citizen was assassinated
 here about midnight by a profligate Italian nobleman or a
 barber on account of a quarrel growing out of the recent
 election The assassin will probably be lynched

One of the twins soliloquized Tom How lucky It is the knife that
has done him this grace We never know when fortune is trying to favor
us I actually cursed Puddnhead Wilson in my heart for putting it out
of my power to sell that knife I take it back now

Tom was now rich and independent He arranged with the planter and
mailed to Wilson the new bill of sale which sold Roxana to herself then
he telegraphed his Aunt Pratt

 Have seen the awful news in the papers and am almost
 prostrated with grief Shall start by packet today Try to
 bear up till I come

When Wilson reached the house of mourning and had gathered such details
as Mrs Pratt and the rest of the crowd could tell him he took command
as mayor and gave orders that nothing should be touched but everything
left as it was until Justice Robinson should arrive and take the proper
measures as coroner He cleared everybody out of the room but the twins
and himself The sheriff soon arrived and took the twins away to jail
Wilson told them to keep heart and promised to do his best in their
defense when the case should come to trial Justice Robinson came
presently and with him Constable Blake They examined the room
thoroughly They found the knife and the sheath Wilson noticed that
there were fingerprints on the knifes handle That pleased him for the
twins had required the earliest comers to make a scrutiny of their hands
and clothes and neither these people nor Wilson himself had found any
bloodstains upon them Could there be a possibility that the twins had
spoken the truth when they had said they found the man dead when they ran
into the house in answer to the cry for help He thought of that
mysterious girl at once But this was not the sort of work for a girl to
be engaged in No matter Tom Driscolls room must be examined

After the coroners jury had viewed the body and its surroundings Wilson
suggested a search upstairs and he went along The jury forced an
entrance to Toms room but found nothing of course

The coroners jury found that the homicide was committed by Luigi and
that Angelo was accessory to it

The town was bitter against the misfortunates and for the first few days
after the murder they were in constant danger of being lynched The
grand jury presently indicted Luigi for murder in the first degree and
Angelo as accessory before the fact The twins were transferred from the
city jail to the county prison to await trial

Wilson examined the finger marks on the knife handle and said to himself
Neither of the twins made those marks Then manifestly there was
another person concerned either in his own interest or as hired
assassin

But who could it be That he must try to find out The safe was not
opened the cashbox was closed and had three thousand dollars in it
Then robbery was not the motive and revenge was Where had the murdered
man an enemy except Luigi There was but that one person in the world
with a deep grudge against him

The mysterious girl The girl was a great trial to Wilson If the motive
had been robbery the girl might answer but there wasnt any girl that
would want to take this old mans life for revenge He had no quarrels
with girls he was a gentleman

Wilson had perfect tracings of the finger marks of the knife handle and
among his glass records he had a great array of fingerprints of women and
girls collected during the last fifteen or eighteen years but he
scanned them in vain they successfully withstood every test among them
were no duplicates of the prints on the knife

The presence of the knife on the stage of the murder was a worrying
circumstance for Wilson A week previously he had as good as admitted to
himself that he believed Luigi had possessed such a knife and that he
still possessed it notwithstanding his pretense that it had been stolen
And now here was the knife and with it the twins Half the town had
said the twins were humbugging when they claimed they had lost their
knife and now these people were joyful and said I told you so

If their fingerprints had been on the handlebut useless to bother any
further about that the fingerprints on the handle were NOT theirsthat
he knew perfectly

Wilson refused to suspect Tom for first Tom couldnt murder anybodyhe
hadnt character enough secondly if he could murder a person he
wouldnt select his doting benefactor and nearest relative thirdly
selfinterest was in the way for while the uncle lived Tom was sure of
a free support and a chance to get the destroyed will revived again but
with the uncle gone that chance was gone too It was true the will had
really been revived as was now discovered but Tom could not have been
aware of it or he would have spoken of it in his native talky
unsecretive way Finally Tom was in St Louis when the murder was done
and got the news out of the morning journals as was shown by his
telegram to his aunt These speculations were unemphasized sensations
rather than articulated thoughts for Wilson would have laughed at the
idea of seriously connecting Tom with the murder

Wilson regarded the case of the twins as desperatein fact about
hopeless For he argued that if a confederate was not found an
enlightened Missouri jury would hang them sure if a confederate was
found that would not improve the matter but simply furnish one more
person for the sheriff to hang Nothing could save the twins but the
discovery of a person who did the murder on his sole personal accountan
undertaking which had all the aspect of the impossible Still the
person who made the fingerprints must be sought The twins might have no
case WITH them but they certainly would have none without him

So Wilson mooned around thinking thinking guessing guessing day and
night and arriving nowhere Whenever he ran across a girl or a woman he
was not acquainted with he got her fingerprints on one pretext or
another and they always cost him a sigh when he got home for they never
tallied with the finger marks on the knife handle

As to the mysterious girl Tom swore he knew no such girl and did not
remember ever seeing a girl wearing a dress like the one described by
Wilson He admitted that he did not always lock his room and that
sometimes the servants forgot to lock the house doors still in his
opinion the girl must have made but few visits or she would have been
discovered When Wilson tried to connect her with the stealing raid and
thought she might have been the old womans confederate if not the very
thief disguised as an old woman Tom seemed stuck and also much
interested and said he would keep a sharp eye out for this person or
persons although he was afraid that she or they would be too smart to
venture again into a town where everybody would now be on the watch for a
good while to come

Everybody was pitying Tom he looked so quiet and sorrowful and seemed
to feel his great loss so deeply He was playing a part but it was not
all a part The picture of his alleged uncle as he had last seen him
was before him in the dark pretty frequently when he was away and
called again in his dreams when he was asleep He wouldnt go into the
room where the tragedy had happened This charmed the doting Mrs Pratt
who realized now as she had never done before she said what a
sensitive and delicate nature her darling had and how he adored his poor
uncle




CHAPTER 20  The Murderer Chuckles

 _Even the clearest and most perfect circumstantial evidence
 is likely to be at fault after all and therefore ought to
 be received with great caution Take the case of any pencil
 sharpened by any woman if you have witnesses you will find
 she did it with a knife but if you take simply the aspect
 of the pencil you will say she did it with her teeth_
 Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


The weeks dragged along no friend visiting the jailed twins but their
counsel and Aunt Patsy Cooper and the day of trial came at lastthe
heaviest day in Wilsons life for with all his tireless diligence he had
discovered no sign or trace of the missing confederate Confederate
was the term he had long ago privately accepted for that personnot as
being unquestionably the right term but as being the least possibly the
right one though he was never able to understand why the twins did not
vanish and escape as the confederate had done instead of remaining by
the murdered man and getting caught there

The courthouse was crowded of course and would remain so to the finish
for not only in the town itself but in the country for miles around the
trial was the one topic of conversation among the people Mrs Pratt in
deep mourning and Tom with a weed on his hat had seats near Pembroke
Howard the public prosecutor and back of them sat a great array of
friends of the family The twins had but one friend present to keep
their counsel in countenance their poor old sorrowing landlady She sat
near Wilson and looked her friendliest In the nigger corner sat
Chambers also Roxy with good clothes on and her bill of sale in her
pocket It was her most precious possession and she never parted with
it day or night Tom had allowed her thirtyfive dollars a month ever
since he came into his property and had said that he and she ought to be
grateful to the twins for making them rich but had roused such a temper
in her by this speech that he did not repeat the argument afterward She
said the old judge had treated her child a thousand times better than he
deserved and had never done her an unkindness in his life so she hated
these outlandish devils for killing him and shouldnt ever sleep
satisfied till she saw them hanged for it She was here to watch the
trial now and was going to lift up just one hooraw over it if the
county judge put her in jail a year for it She gave her turbaned head a
toss and said When dat verdic comes Is gwine to lif dat ROOF now
I TELL you

Pembroke Howard briefly sketched the states case He said he would show
by a chain of circumstantial evidence without break or fault in it
anywhere that the principal prisoner at the bar committed the murder
that the motive was partly revenge and partly a desire to take his own
life out of jeopardy and that his brother by his presence was a
consenting accessory to the crime a crime which was the basest known to
the calendar of human misdeedsassassination that it was conceived by
the blackest of hearts and consummated by the cowardliest of hands a
crime which had broken a loving sisters heart blighted the happiness of
a young nephew who was as dear as a son brought inconsolable grief to
many friends and sorrow and loss to the whole community The utmost
penalty of the outraged law would be exacted and upon the accused now
present at the bar that penalty would unquestionably be executed He
would reserve further remark until his closing speech

He was strongly moved and so also was the whole house Mrs Pratt and
several other women were weeping when he sat down and many an eye that
was full of hate was riveted upon the unhappy prisoners

Witness after witness was called by the state and questioned at length
but the cross questioning was brief Wilson knew they could furnish
nothing valuable for his side People were sorry for Puddnhead Wilson
his budding career would get hurt by this trial

Several witnesses swore they heard Judge Driscoll say in his public
speech that the twins would be able to find their lost knife again when
they needed it to assassinate somebody with This was not news but now
it was seen to have been sorrowfully prophetic and a profound sensation
quivered through the hushed courtroom when those dismal words were
repeated

The public prosecutor rose and said that it was within his knowledge
through a conversation held with Judge Driscoll on the last day of his
life that counsel for the defense had brought him a challenge from the
person charged at the bar with murder that he had refused to fight with
a confessed assassinthat is on the field of honor but had added
significantly that he would be ready for him elsewhere Presumably
the person here charged with murder was warned that he must kill or be
killed the first time he should meet Judge Driscoll If counsel for the
defense chose to let the statement stand so he would not call him to the
witness stand Mr Wilson said he would offer no denial Murmurs in the
house It is getting worse and worse for Wilsons case

Mrs Pratt testified that she heard no outcry and did not know what woke
her up unless it was the sound of rapid footsteps approaching the front
door She jumped up and ran out in the hall just as she was and heard
the footsteps flying up the front steps and then following behind her as
she ran to the sitting room There she found the accused standing over
her murdered brother Here she broke down and sobbed Sensation in the
court Resuming she said the persons entered behind her were Mr Rogers
and Mr Buckstone

Crossexamined by Wilson she said the twins proclaimed their innocence
declared that they had been taking a walk and had hurried to the house
in response to a cry for help which was so loud and strong that they had
heard it at a considerable distance that they begged her and the
gentlemen just mentioned to examine their hands and clotheswhich was
done and no blood stains found

Confirmatory evidence followed from Rogers and Buckstone

The finding of the knife was verified the advertisement minutely
describing it and offering a reward for it was put in evidence and its
exact correspondence with that description proved Then followed a few
minor details and the case for the state was closed

Wilson said that he had three witnesses the Misses Clarkson who would
testify that they met a veiled young woman leaving Judge Driscolls
premises by the back gate a few minutes after the cries for help were
heard and that their evidence taken with certain circumstantial
evidence which he would call the courts attention to would in his
opinion convince the court that there was still one person concerned in
this crime who had not yet been found and also that a stay of
proceedings ought to be granted in justice to his clients until that
person should be discovered As it was late he would ask leave to defer
the examination of his three witnesses until the next morning

The crowd poured out of the place and went flocking away in excited
groups and couples taking the events of the session over with vivacity
and consuming interest and everybody seemed to have had a satisfactory
and enjoyable day except the accused their counsel and their old lady
friend There was no cheer among these and no substantial hope

In parting with the twins Aunt Patsy did attempt a goodnight with a gay
pretense of hope and cheer in it but broke down without finishing

Absolutely secure as Tom considered himself to be the opening
solemnities of the trial had nevertheless oppressed him with a vague
uneasiness his being a nature sensitive to even the smallest alarms but
from the moment that the poverty and weakness of Wilsons case lay
exposed to the court he was comfortable once more even jubilant He
left the courtroom sarcastically sorry for Wilson The Clarksons met an
unknown woman in the back lane he said to himself THAT is his case
Ill give him a century to find her ina couple of them if he likes A
woman who doesnt exist any longer and the clothes that gave her her sex
burnt up and the ashes thrown awayoh certainly hell find HER easy
enough This reflection set him to admiring for the hundredth time
the shrewd ingenuities by which he had insured himself against
detectionmore against even suspicion

Nearly always in cases like this there is some little detail or other
overlooked some wee little track or trace left behind and detection
follows but here theres not even the faintest suggestion of a trace
left No more than a bird leaves when it flies through the airyes
through the night you may say The man that can track a bird through the
air in the dark and find that bird is the man to track me out and find
the judges assassinno other need apply And that is the job that has
been laid out for poor Puddnhead Wilson of all people in the world
Lord it will be pathetically funny to see him grubbing and groping after
that woman that dont exist and the right person sitting under his very
nose all the time The more he thought the situation over the more the
humor of it struck him Finally he said Ill never let him hear the
last of that woman Every time I catch him in company to his dying day
Ill ask him in the guileless affectionate way that used to gravel him so
when I inquired how his unborn law business was coming along Got on her
track yethey Puddnhead He wanted to laugh but that would not
have answered there were people about and he was mourning for his
uncle He made up his mind that it would be good entertainment to look
in on Wilson that night and watch him worry over his barren law case and
goad him with an exasperating word or two of sympathy and commiseration
now and then

Wilson wanted no supper he had no appetite He got out all the
fingerprints of girls and women in his collection of records and pored
gloomily over them an hour or more trying to convince himself that that
troublesome girls marks were there somewhere and had been overlooked
But it was not so He drew back his chair clasped his hands over his
head and gave himself up to dull and arid musings

Tom Driscoll dropped in an hour after dark and said with a pleasant
laugh as he took a seat

Hello weve gone back to the amusements of our days of neglect and
obscurity for consolation have we and he took up one of the glass
strips and held it against the light to inspect it Come cheer up old
man theres no use in losing your grip and going back to this childs
play merely because this big sunspot is drifting across your shiny new
disk Itll pass and youll be all right againand he laid the glass
down Did you think you could win always

Oh no said Wilson with a sigh I didnt expect that but I cant
believe Luigi killed your uncle and I feel very sorry for him It makes
me blue And you would feel as I do Tom if you were not prejudiced
against those young fellows

I dont know about that and Toms countenance darkened for his memory
reverted to his kicking I owe them no good will considering the
brunet ones treatment of me that night Prejudice or no prejudice
Puddnhead I dont like them and when they get their deserts youre not
going to find me sitting on the mourners bench

He took up another strip of glass and exclaimed

Why heres old Roxys label Are you going to ornament the royal
palaces with nigger paw marks too By the date here I was seven months
old when this was done and she was nursing me and her little nigger cub
Theres a line straight across her thumbprint How comes that and Tom
held out the piece of glass to Wilson

That is common said the bored man wearily Scar of a cut or a
scratch usuallyand he took the strip of glass indifferently and
raised it toward the lamp

All the blood sank suddenly out of his face his hand quaked and he
gazed at the polished surface before him with the glassy stare of a
corpse

Great heavens whats the matter with you Wilson Are you going to
faint

Tom sprang for a glass of water and offered it but Wilson shrank
shuddering from him and said

No notake it away His breast was rising and falling and he moved
his head about in a dull and wandering way like a person who had been
stunned Presently he said I shall feel better when I get to bed I
have been overwrought today yes and overworked for many days

Then Ill leave you and let you get to your rest Good night old man
But as Tom went out he couldnt deny himself a small parting gibe
Dont take it so hard a body cant win every time youll hang somebody
yet

Wilson muttered to himself It is no lie to say I am sorry I have to
begin with you miserable dog though you are

He braced himself up with a glass of cold whisky and went to work again
He did not compare the new finger marks unintentionally left by Tom a few
minutes before on Roxys glass with the tracings of the marks left on the
knife handle there being no need for that for his trained eye but
busied himself with another matter muttering from time to time Idiot
that I wasNothing but a GIRL would do mea man in girls clothes
never occurred to me First he hunted out the plate containing the
fingerprints made by Tom when he was twelve years old and laid it by
itself then he brought forth the marks made by Toms baby fingers when
he was a suckling of seven months and placed these two plates with the
one containing this subjects newly and unconsciously made record

Now the series is complete he said with satisfaction and sat down to
inspect these things and enjoy them

But his enjoyment was brief He stared a considerable time at the three
strips and seemed stupefied with astonishment At last he put them down
and said I cant make it out at allhang it the babys dont tally
with the others

He walked the floor for half an hour puzzling over his enigma then he
hunted out the other glass plates

He sat down and puzzled over these things a good while but kept
muttering Its no use I cant understand it They dont tally right
and yet Ill swear the names and dates are right and so of course they
OUGHT to tally I never labeled one of these thing carelessly in my
life There is a most extraordinary mystery here

He was tired out now and his brains were beginning to clog He said he
would sleep himself fresh and then see what he could do with this
riddle He slept through a troubled and unrestful hour then
unconsciousness began to shred away and presently he rose drowsily to a
sitting posture Now what was that dream he said trying to recall
it What was that dream It seemed to unravel that puz

He landed in the middle of the floor at a bound without finishing the
sentence and ran and turned up his light and seized his records He
took a single swift glance at them and cried out

Its so Heavens what a revelation And for twentythree years no man
has ever suspected it




CHAPTER 21  Doom

 _He is useless on top of the ground he ought to be under
 it inspiring the cabbages_ Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar

 _APRIL 1 This is the day upon which we are reminded of what
 we are on the other three hundred and sixtyfour_
 Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


Wilson put on enough clothes for business purposes and went to work
under a high pressure of steam He was awake all over All sense of
weariness had been swept away by the invigorating refreshment of the
great and hopeful discovery which he had made He made fine and accurate
reproductions of a number of his records and then enlarged them on a
scale of ten to one with his pantograph He did these pantograph
enlargements on sheets of white cardboard and made each individual line
of the bewildering maze of whorls or curves or loops which consisted of
the pattern of a record stand out bold and black by reinforcing it
with ink To the untrained eye the collection of delicate originals made
by the human finger on the glass plates looked about alike but when
enlarged ten times they resembled the markings of a block of wood that
has been sawed across the grain and the dullest eye could detect at a
glance and at a distance of many feet that no two of the patterns were
alike When Wilson had at last finished his tedious and difficult work
he arranged his results according to a plan in which a progressive order
and sequence was a principal feature then he added to the batch several
pantograph enlargements which he had made from time to time in bygone
years

The night was spent and the day well advanced now By the time he had
snatched a trifle of breakfast it was nine oclock and the court was
ready to begin its sitting He was in his place twelve minutes later
with his records

Tom Driscoll caught a slight glimpse of the records and nudged his
nearest friend and said with a wink Puddnheads got a rare eye to
businessthinks that as long as he cant win his case its at least a
noble good chance to advertise his window palace decorations without any
expense Wilson was informed that his witnesses had been delayed but
would arrive presently but he rose and said he should probably not have
occasion to make use of their testimony An amused murmur ran through
the room Its a clean backdown he gives up without hitting a lick
Wilson continued I have other testimonyand better This compelled
interest and evoked murmurs of surprise that had a detectable ingredient
of disappointment in them If I seem to be springing this evidence upon
the court I offer as my justification for this that I did not discover
its existence until late last night and have been engaged in examining
and classifying it ever since until half an hour ago I shall offer it
presently but first I wish to say a few preliminary words

May it please the court the claim given the front place the claim most
persistently urged the claim most strenuously and I may even say
aggressively and defiantly insisted upon by the prosecution is thisthat
the person whose hand left the bloodstained fingerprints upon the handle
of the Indian knife is the person who committed the murder Wilson
paused during several moments to give impressiveness to what he was
about to say and then added tranquilly WE GRANT THAT CLAIM

It was an electrical surprise No one was prepared for such an
admission A buzz of astonishment rose on all sides and people were
heard to intimate that the overworked lawyer had lost his mind Even the
veteran judge accustomed as he was to legal ambushes and masked
batteries in criminal procedure was not sure that his ears were not
deceiving him and asked counsel what it was he had said Howards
impassive face betrayed no sign but his attitude and bearing lost
something of their careless confidence for a moment Wilson resumed

We not only grant that claim but we welcome it and strongly endorse it
Leaving that matter for the present we will now proceed to consider
other points in the case which we propose to establish by evidence and
shall include that one in the chain in its proper place

He had made up his mind to try a few hardy guesses in mapping out his
theory of the origin and motive of the murderguesses designed to fill
up gaps in itguesses which could help if they hit and would probably
do no harm if they didnt

To my mind certain circumstances of the case before the court seem to
suggest a motive for the homicide quite different from the one insisted
on by the state It is my conviction that the motive was not revenge
but robbery It has been urged that the presence of the accused brothers
in that fatal room just after notification that one of them must take
the life of Judge Driscoll or lose his own the moment the parties should
meet clearly signifies that the natural instinct of selfpreservation
moved my clients to go there secretly and save Count Luigi by destroying
his adversary

Then why did they stay there after the deed was done Mrs Pratt had
time although she did not hear the cry for help but woke up some
moments later to run to that roomand there she found these men
standing and making no effort to escape If they were guilty they ought
to have been running out of the house at the same time that she was
running to that room If they had had such a strong instinct toward
selfpreservation as to move them to kill that unarmed man what had
become of it now when it should have been more alert than ever Would
any of us have remained there Let us not slander our intelligence to
that degree

Much stress has been laid upon the fact that the accused offered a very
large reward for the knife with which this murder was done that no thief
came forward to claim that extraordinary reward that the latter fact was
good circumstantial evidence that the claim that the knife had been
stolen was a vanity and a fraud that these details taken in connection
with the memorable and apparently prophetic speech of the deceased
concerning that knife and the final discovery of that very knife in
the fatal room where no living person was found present with the
slaughtered man but the owner of the knife and his brother form an
indestructible chain of evidence which fixed the crime upon those
unfortunate strangers

But I shall presently ask to be sworn and shall testify that there was
a large reward offered for the THIEF also and it was offered secretly
and not advertised that this fact was indiscreetly mentionedor at
least tacitly admittedin what was supposed to be safe circumstances
but may NOT have been The thief may have been present himself Tom
Driscoll had been looking at the speaker but dropped his eyes at this
point In that case he would retain the knife in his possession not
daring to offer it for sale or for pledge in a pawnshop There was a
nodding of heads among the audience by way of admission that this was not
a bad stroke I shall prove to the satisfaction of the jury that there
WAS a person in Judge Driscolls room several minutes before the accused
entered it This produced a strong sensation the last drowsy head in
the courtroom roused up now and made preparation to listen If it
shall seem necessary I will prove by the Misses Clarkson that they met a
veiled personostensibly a womancoming out of the back gate a few
minutes after the cry for help was heard This person was not a woman
but a man dressed in womans clothes Another sensation Wilson had his
eye on Tom when he hazarded this guess to see what effect it would
produce He was satisfied with the result and said to himself It was
a successhes hit

The object of that person in that house was robbery not murder It is
true that the safe was not open but there was an ordinary cashbox on the
table with three thousand dollars in it It is easily supposable that
the thief was concealed in the house that he knew of this box and of
its owners habit of counting its contents and arranging his accounts at
nightif he had that habit which I do not assert of coursethat he
tried to take the box while its owner slept but made a noise and was
seized and had to use the knife to save himself from capture and that
he fled without his booty because he heard help coming

I have now done with my theory and will proceed to the evidences by
which I propose to try to prove its soundness Wilson took up several of
his strips of glass When the audience recognized these familiar
mementos of Puddnheads old time childish puttering and folly the
tense and funereal interest vanished out of their faces and the house
burst into volleys of relieving and refreshing laughter and Tom chirked
up and joined in the fun himself but Wilson was apparently not
disturbed He arranged his records on the table before him and said

I beg the indulgence of the court while I make a few remarks in
explanation of some evidence which I am about to introduce and which I
shall presently ask to be allowed to verify under oath on the witness
stand Every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave
certain physical marks which do not change their character and by which
he can always be identifiedand that without shade of doubt or question
These marks are his signature his physiological autograph so to speak
and this autograph can not be counterfeited nor can he disguise it or
hide it away nor can it become illegible by the wear and mutations of
time This signature is not his faceage can change that beyond
recognition it is not his hair for that can fall out it is not his
height for duplicates of that exist it is not his form for duplicates
of that exist also whereas this signature is each mans very ownthere
is no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the globe The
audience were interested once more

This autograph consists of the delicate lines or corrugations with which
Nature marks the insides of the hands and the soles of the feet If you
will look at the balls of your fingersyou that have very sharp
eyesightyou will observe that these dainty curving lines lie close
together like those that indicate the borders of oceans in maps and
that they form various clearly defined patterns such as arches circles
long curves whorls etc and that these patterns differ on the different
fingers Every man in the room had his hand up to the light now and
his head canted to one side and was minutely scrutinizing the balls of
his fingers there were whispered ejaculations of Why its soI never
noticed that before The patterns on the right hand are not the same as
those on the left Ejaculations of Why thats so too Taken finger
for finger your patterns differ from your neighbors Comparisons were
made all over the houseeven the judge and jury were absorbed in this
curious work The patterns of a twins right hand are not the same as
those on his left One twins patterns are never the same as his fellow
twins patternsthe jury will find that the patterns upon the finger
balls of the twins hands follow this rule An examination of the
twins hands was begun at once You have often heard of twins who were
so exactly alike that when dressed alike their own parents could not tell
them apart Yet there was never a twin born in to this world that did not
carry from birth to death a sure identifier in this mysterious and
marvelous natal autograph That once known to you his fellow twin could
never personate him and deceive you

Wilson stopped and stood silent Inattention dies a quick and sure death
when a speaker does that The stillness gives warning that something is
coming All palms and finger balls went down now all slouching forms
straightened all heads came up all eyes were fastened upon Wilsons
face He waited yet one two three moments to let his pause complete
and perfect its spell upon the house then when through the profound
hush he could hear the ticking of the clock on the wall he put out his
hand and took the Indian knife by the blade and held it aloft where all
could see the sinister spots upon its ivory handle then he said in a
level and passionless voice

Upon this haft stands the assassins natal autograph written in the
blood of that helpless and unoffending old man who loved you and whom you
all loved There is but one man in the whole earth whose hand can
duplicate that crimson signhe paused and raised his eyes to the
pendulum swinging back and forthand please God we will produce that
man in this room before the clock strikes noon

Stunned distraught unconscious of its own movement the house half
rose as if expecting to see the murderer appear at the door and a
breeze of muttered ejaculations swept the place Order in the
courtsit down This from the sheriff He was obeyed and quiet
reigned again Wilson stole a glance at Tom and said to himself He is
flying signals of distress now even people who despise him are pitying
him they think this is a hard ordeal for a young fellow who has lost his
benefactor by so cruel a strokeand they are right He resumed his
speech

For more than twenty years I have amused my compulsory leisure with
collecting these curious physical signatures in this town At my house I
have hundreds upon hundreds of them Each and every one is labeled with
name and date not labeled the next day or even the next hour but in the
very minute that the impression was taken When I go upon the witness
stand I will repeat under oath the things which I am now saying I have
the fingerprints of the court the sheriff and every member of the jury
There is hardly a person in this room white or black whose natal
signature I cannot produce and not one of them can so disguise himself
that I cannot pick him out from a multitude of his fellow creatures and
unerringly identify him by his hands And if he and I should live to be a
hundred I could still do it The interest of the audience was steadily
deepening now

I have studied some of these signatures so much that I know them as well
as the bank cashier knows the autograph of his oldest customer While I
turn my back now I beg that several persons will be so good as to pass
their fingers through their hair and then press them upon one of the
panes of the window near the jury and that among them the accused may
set THEIR finger marks Also I beg that these experimenters or others
will set their fingers upon another pane and add again the marks of the
accused but not placing them in the same order or relation to the other
signatures as beforefor by one chance in a million a person might
happen upon the right marks by pure guesswork ONCE therefore I wish to
be tested twice

He turned his back and the two panes were quickly covered with
delicately lined oval spots but visible only to such persons as could
get a dark background for themthe foliage of a tree outside for
instance Then upon call Wilson went to the window made his
examination and said

This is Count Luigis right hand this one three signatures below is
his left Here is Count Angelos right down here is his left Now for
the other pane here and here are Count Luigis here and here are his
brothers He faced about Am I right

A deafening explosion of applause was the answer The bench said

This certainly approaches the miraculous

Wilson turned to the window again and remarked pointing with his finger

This is the signature of Mr Justice Robinson Applause This of
Constable Blake Applause This of John Mason juryman Applause
This of the sheriff Applause I cannot name the others but I have
them all at home named and dated and could identify them all by my
fingerprint records

He moved to his place through a storm of applausewhich the sheriff
stopped and also made the people sit down for they were all standing
and struggling to see of course Court jury sheriff and everybody
had been too absorbed in observing Wilsons performance to attend to the
audience earlier

Now then said Wilson I have here the natal autographs of the two
childrenthrown up to ten times the natural size by the pantograph so
that anyone who can see at all can tell the markings apart at a glance
We will call the children A and B Here are As finger marks taken at
the age of five months Here they are again taken at seven months Tom
started They are alike you see Here are Bs at five months and also
at seven months They too exactly copy each other but the patterns
are quite different from As you observe I shall refer to these again
presently but we will turn them face down now

Here thrown up ten sizes are the natal autographs of the two persons
who are here before you accused of murdering Judge Driscoll I made these
pantograph copies last night and will so swear when I go upon the
witness stand I ask the jury to compare them with the finger marks of
the accused upon the windowpanes and tell the court if they are the
same

He passed a powerful magnifying glass to the foreman

One juryman after another took the cardboard and the glass and made the
comparison Then the foreman said to the judge

Your honor we are all agreed that they are identical

Wilson said to the foreman

Please turn that cardboard face down and take this one and compare it
searchingly by the magnifier with the fatal signature upon the knife
handle and report your finding to the court

Again the jury made minute examinations and again reported

We find them to be exactly identical your honor

Wilson turned toward the counsel for the prosecution and there was a
clearly recognizable note of warning in his voice when he said

May it please the court the state has claimed strenuously and
persistently that the bloodstained fingerprints upon that knife handle
were left there by the assassin of Judge Driscoll You have heard us
grant that claim and welcome it He turned to the jury Compare the
fingerprints of the accused with the fingerprints left by the
assassinand report

The comparison began As it proceeded all movement and all sound
ceased and the deep silence of an absorbed and waiting suspense settled
upon the house and when at last the words came THEY DO NOT EVEN
RESEMBLE a thundercrash of applause followed and the house sprang to
its feet but was quickly repressed by official force and brought to
order again Tom was altering his position every few minutes now but
none of his changes brought repose nor any small trifle of comfort When
the houses attention was become fixed once more Wilson said gravely
indicating the twins with a gesture

These men are innocentI have no further concern with them Another
outbreak of applause began but was promptly checked We will now
proceed to find the guilty Toms eyes were starting from their
socketsyes it was a cruel day for the bereaved youth everybody
thought We will return to the infant autographs of A and B I will
ask the jury to take these large pantograph facsimilies of As marked
five months and seven months Do they tally

The foreman responded Perfectly

Now examine this pantograph taken at eight months and also marked A
Does it tally with the other two

The surprised response was

NOTHEY DIFFER WIDELY

You are quite right Now take these two pantographs of Bs autograph
marked five months and seven months Do they tally with each other

Yesperfectly

Take this third pantograph marked B eight months Does it tally with
Bs other two

BY NO MEANS

Do you know how to account for those strange discrepancies I will tell
you For a purpose unknown to us but probably a selfish one somebody
changed those children in the cradle

This produced a vast sensation naturally Roxana was astonished at this
admirable guess but not disturbed by it To guess the exchange was one
thing to guess who did it quite another Puddnhead Wilson could do
wonderful things no doubt but he couldnt do impossible ones Safe
She was perfectly safe She smiled privately

Between the ages of seven months and eight months those children were
changed in the cradlehe made one of this effectcollecting pauses
and addedand the person who did it is in this house

Roxys pulses stood still The house was thrilled as with an electric
shock and the people half rose as if to seek a glimpse of the person who
had made that exchange Tom was growing limp the life seemed oozing out
of him Wilson resumed

A was put into Bs cradle in the nursery B was transferred to the
kitchen and became a Negro and a slave Sensationconfusion of angry
ejaculationsbut within a quarter of an hour he will stand before you
white and free Burst of applause checked by the officers From
seven months onward until now A has still been a usurper and in my
finger record he bears Bs name Here is his pantograph at the age of
twelve Compare it with the assassins signature upon the knife handle
Do they tally

The foreman answered

TO THE MINUTEST DETAIL

Wilson said solemnly

The murderer of your friend and mineYork Driscoll of the generous hand
and the kindly spiritsits in among you Valet de Chambre Negro and
slavefalsely called Thomas a Becket Driscollmake upon the window the
fingerprints that will hang you

Tom turned his ashen face imploring toward the speaker made some
impotent movements with his white lips then slid limp and lifeless to
the floor

Wilson broke the awed silence with the words

There is no need He has confessed

Roxy flung herself upon her knees covered her face with her hands and
out through her sobs the words struggled

De Lord have mercy on me po misasble sinner dat I is

The clock struck twelve

The court rose the new prisoner handcuffed was removed



CONCLUSION

 _It is often the case that the man who cant tell a lie
 thinks he is the best judge of one_ Puddnhead Wilsons
 Calendar

 _OCTOBER 12 THE DISCOVERY It was wonderful to find
 America but it would have been more wonderful to miss it_
 Puddnhead Wilsons Calendar


The town sat up all night to discuss the amazing events of the day and
swap guesses as to when Toms trial would begin Troop after troop of
citizens came to serenade Wilson and require a speech and shout
themselves hoarse over every sentence that fell from his lipsfor all
his sentences were golden now all were marvelous His long fight
against hard luck and prejudice was ended he was a made man for good
And as each of these roaring gangs of enthusiasts marched away some
remorseful member of it was quite sure to raise his voice and say

And this is the man the likes of us have called a puddnhead for more
than twenty years He has resigned from that position friends

Yes but it isnt vacantwere elected

The twins were heroes of romance now and with rehabilitated
reputations But they were weary of Western adventure and straightway
retired to Europe

Roxys heart was broken The young fellow upon whom she had inflicted
twentythree years of slavery continued the false heirs pension of
thirtyfive dollars a month to her but her hurts were too deep for money
to heal the spirit in her eye was quenched her martial bearing departed
with it and the voice of her laughter ceased in the land In her church
and its affairs she found her only solace

The real heir suddenly found himself rich and free but in a most
embarrassing situation He could neither read nor write and his speech
was the basest dialect of the Negro quarter His gait his attitudes his
gestures his bearing his laughall were vulgar and uncouth his
manners were the manners of a slave Money and fine clothes could not
mend these defects or cover them up they only made them more glaring and
the more pathetic The poor fellow could not endure the terrors of the
white mans parlor and felt at home and at peace nowhere but in the
kitchen The family pew was a misery to him yet he could nevermore enter
into the solacing refuge of the nigger gallerythat was closed to him
for good and all But we cannot follow his curious fate furtherthat
would be a long story

The false heir made a full confession and was sentenced to imprisonment
for life But now a complication came up The Percy Driscoll estate was
in such a crippled shape when its owner died that it could pay only sixty
percent of its great indebtedness and was settled at that rate But the
creditors came forward now and complained that inasmuch as through an
error for which THEY were in no way to blame the false heir was not
inventoried at the time with the rest of the property great wrong and
loss had thereby been inflicted upon them They rightly claimed that
Tom was lawfully their property and had been so for eight years that
they had already lost sufficiently in being deprived of his services
during that long period and ought not to be required to add anything to
that loss that if he had been delivered up to them in the first place
they would have sold him and he could not have murdered Judge Driscoll
therefore it was not that he had really committed the murder the guilt
lay with the erroneous inventory Everybody saw that there was reason in
this Everybody granted that if Tom were white and free it would be
unquestionably right to punish himit would be no loss to anybody but
to shut up a valuable slave for lifethat was quite another matter

As soon as the Governor understood the case he pardoned Tom at once and
the creditors sold him down the river





AUTHORS NOTE TO THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS

A man who is not born with the novelwriting gift has a troublesome time
of it when he tries to build a novel I know this from experience He
has no clear idea of his story in fact he has no story He merely has
some people in his mind and an incident or two also a locality and he
trusts he can plunge those people into those incidents with interesting
results So he goes to work To write a novel Nothat is a thought
which comes later in the beginning he is only proposing to tell a little
tale a very little tale a sixpage tale But as it is a tale which he
is not acquainted with and can only find out what it is by listening as
it goes along telling itself it is more than apt to go on and on and on
till it spreads itself into a book I know about this because it has
happened to me so many times

And I have noticed another thing that as the short tale grows into the
long tale the original intention or motif is apt to get abolished and
find itself superseded by a quite different one It was so in the case
of a magazine sketch which I once started to writea funny and fantastic
sketch about a prince and a pauper it presently assumed a grave cast of
its own accord and in that new shape spread itself out into a book Much
the same thing happened with PUDDNHEAD WILSON I had a sufficiently
hard time with that tale because it changed itself from a farce to a
tragedy while I was going along with ita most embarrassing
circumstance But what was a great deal worse was that it was not one
story but two stories tangled together and they obstructed and
interrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion and
annoyance I could not offer the book for publication for I was afraid
it would unseat the readers reason I did not know what was the matter
with it for I had not noticed as yet that it was two stories in one
It took me months to make that discovery I carried the manuscript back
and forth across the Atlantic two or three times and read it and studied
over it on shipboard and at last I saw where the difficulty lay I had
no further trouble I pulled one of the stories out by the roots and
left the othera kind of literary Caesarean operation

Would the reader care to know something about the story which I pulled
out He has been told many a time how the bornandtrained novelist
works wont he let me round and complete his knowledge by telling him
how the jackleg does it

Originally the story was called THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS I meant to
make it very short I had seen a picture of a youthful Italian
freakor freakswhich wasor which wereon exhibition in our
citiesa combination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a
single body and a single pair of legsand I thought I would write an
extravagantly fantastic little story with this freak of nature for
heroor heroesa silly young miss for heroine and two old ladies and
two boys for the minor parts I lavishly elaborated these people and
their doings of course But the tale kept spreading along and spreading
along and other people got to intruding themselves and taking up more
and more room with their talk and their affairs Among them came a
stranger named Puddnhead Wilson and a woman named Roxana and presently
the doings of these two pushed up into prominence a young fellow named
Tom Driscoll whose proper place was away in the obscure background
Before the book was half finished those three were taking things almost
entirely into their own hands and working the whole tale as a private
venture of their owna tale which they had nothing at all to do with by
rights

When the book was finished and I came to look around to see what had
become of the team I had originally started out withAunt Patsy Cooper
Aunt Betsy Hale and two boys and Rowena the lightweight heroinethey
were nowhere to be seen they had disappeared from the story some time or
other I hunted about and found themfound them stranded idle
forgotten and permanently useless It was very awkward It was awkward
all around but more particularly in the case of Rowena because there
was a love match on between her and one of the twins that constituted
the freak and I had worked it up to a blistering heat and thrown in a
quite dramatic love quarrel wherein Rowena scathingly denounced her
betrothed for getting drunk and scoffed at his explanation of how it had
happened and wouldnt listen to it and had driven him from her in the
usual forever way and now here she sat crying and brokenhearted for
she had found that he had spoken only the truth that it was not he but
the other of the freak that had drunk the liquor that made him drunk
that her half was a prohibitionist and had never drunk a drop in his
life and altogether tight as a brick three days in the week was wholly
innocent of blame and indeed when sober was constantly doing all he
could to reform his brother the other half who never got any
satisfaction out of drinking anyway because liquor never affected him
Yes here she was stranded with that deep injustice of hers torturing
her poor torn heart

I didnt know what to do with her I was as sorry for her as anybody
could be but the campaign was over the book was finished she was
sidetracked and there was no possible way of crowding her in anywhere
I could not leave her there of course it would not do After spreading
her out so and making such a todo over her affairs it would be
absolutely necessary to account to the reader for her I thought and
thought and studied and studied but I arrived at nothing I finally saw
plainly that there was really no way but oneI must simply give her the
grand bounce It grieved me to do it for after associating with her so
much I had come to kind of like her after a fashion notwithstanding she
was such an ass and said such stupid irritating things and was so
nauseatingly sentimental Still it had to be done So at the top of
Chapter XVII I put a Calendar remark concerning July the Fourth and
began the chapter with this statistic

Rowena went out in the backyard after supper to see the fireworks and
fell down the well and got drowned

It seemed abrupt but I thought maybe the reader wouldnt notice it
because I changed the subject right away to something else Anyway it
loosened up Rowena from where she was stuck and got her out of the way
and that was the main thing It seemed a prompt good way of weeding out
people that had got stalled and a plenty good enough way for those
others so I hunted up the two boys and said They went out back one
night to stone the cat and fell down the well and got drowned Next I
searched around and found old Aunt Patsy and Aunt Betsy Hale where they
were around and said They went out back one night to visit the sick
and fell down the well and got drowned I was going to drown some
others but I gave up the idea partly because I believed that if I kept
that up it would arouse attention and perhaps sympathy with those people
and partly because it was not a large well and would not hold any more
anyway

Still the story was unsatisfactory Here was a set of new characters who
were become inordinately prominent and who persisted in remaining so to
the end and back yonder was an older set who made a large noise and a
great todo for a little while and then suddenly played out utterly and
fell down the well There was a radical defect somewhere and I must
search it out and cure it

The defect turned out to be the one already spoken oftwo stories in
one a farce and a tragedy So I pulled out the farce and left the
tragedy This left the original team in but only as mere names not as
characters Their prominence was wholly gone they were not even worth
drowning so I removed that detail Also I took the twins apart and made
two separate men of them They had no occasion to have foreign names now
but it was too much trouble to remove them all through so I left them
christened as they were and made no explanation
