MAIN STREET AND OTHER POEMS




Main Street

For S M L



 I like to look at the blossomy track of the moon upon the sea
 But it isnt half so fine a sight as Main Street used to be
 When it all was covered over with a couple of feet of snow
 And over the crisp and radiant road the ringing sleighs would go

 Now Main Street bordered with autumn leaves it was a pleasant thing
 And its gutters were gay with dandelions early in the Spring
 I like to think of it white with frost or dusty in the heat
 Because I think it is humaner than any other street

 A city street that is busy and wide is ground by a thousand wheels
 And a burden of traffic on its breast is all it ever feels
 It is dully conscious of weight and speed and of work that never ends
 But it cannot be human like Main Street and recognise its friends

 There were only about a hundred teams on Main Street in a day
 And twenty or thirty people I guess and some children out to play
 And there wasnt a wagon or buggy or a man or a girl or a boy
 That Main Street didnt remember and somehow seem to enjoy

 The truck and the motor and trolley car and the elevated train
 They make the weary city street reverberate with pain
 But there is yet an echo left deep down within my heart
 Of the music the Main Street cobblestones made beneath a butchers cart

 God be thanked for the Milky Way that runs across the sky
 Thats the path that my feet would tread whenever I have to die
 Some folks call it a Silver Sword and some a Pearly Crown
 But the only thing I think it is is Main Street Heaventown




Roofs

For Amelia Josephine Burr



 The road is wide and the stars are out
 and the breath of the night is sweet
 And this is the time when wanderlust should seize upon my feet
 But Im glad to turn from the open road and the starlight on my face
 And to leave the splendour of outofdoors for a human dwelling place

 I never have seen a vagabond who really liked to roam
 All up and down the streets of the world and not to have a home
 The tramp who slept in your barn last night and left at break of day
 Will wander only until he finds another place to stay

 A gypsyman will sleep in his cart with canvas overhead
 Or else hell go into his tent when it is time for bed
 Hell sit on the grass and take his ease so long as the sun is high
 But when it is dark he wants a roof to keep away the sky

 If you call a gypsy a vagabond I think you do him wrong
 For he never goes atravelling but he takes his home along
 And the only reason a road is good as every wanderer knows
 Is just because of the homes the homes the homes to which it goes

 They say that life is a highway and its milestones are the years
 And now and then theres a tollgate where you buy your way with tears
 Its a rough road and a steep road and it stretches broad and far
 But at last it leads to a golden Town where golden Houses are




The Snowman in the Yard

For Thomas Augustine Daly



 The Judges house has a splendid porch with pillars and steps of stone
 And the Judge has a lovely flowering hedge that came from across the seas
 In the Hales garage you could put my house and everything I own
 And the Hales have a lawn like an emerald and a row of poplar trees

 Now I have only a little house and only a little lot
 And only a few square yards of lawn with dandelions starred
 But when Winter comes I have something there
 that the Judge and the Hales have not
 And its better worth having than all their wealth 
 its a snowman in the yard

 The Judges money brings architects to make his mansion fair
 The Hales have seven gardeners to make their roses grow
 The Judge can get his trees from Spain and France and everywhere
 And raise his orchids under glass in the midst of all the snow

 But I have something no architect or gardener ever made
 A thing that is shaped by the busy touch of little mittened hands
 And the Judge would give up his lonely estate where the level snow is laid
 For the tiny house with the trampled yard
 the yard where the snowman stands

 They say that after Adam and Eve were driven away in tears
 To toil and suffer their lifetime through
 because of the sin they sinned
 The Lord made Winter to punish them for half their exiled years
 To chill their blood with the snow and pierce
 their flesh with the icy wind

 But we who inherit the primal curse and labour for our bread
 Have yet thank God the gift of Home though Edens gate is barred
 And through the Winters crystal veil Loves roses blossom red
 For him who lives in a house that has a snowman in the yard




A Blue Valentine

For Aline



 Monsignore
 Right Reverend Bishop Valentinus
 Sometime of Interamna which is called Ferni
 Now of the delightful Court of Heaven
 I respectfully salute you
 I genuflect
 And I kiss your episcopal ring

 It is not Monsignore
 The fragrant memory of your holy life
 Nor that of your shining and joyous martyrdom
 Which causes me now to address you
 But since this is your august festival Monsignore
 It seems appropriate to me to state
 According to a venerable and agreeable custom
 That I love a beautiful lady
 Her eyes Monsignore
 Are so blue that they put lovely little blue reflections
 On everything that she looks at
 Such as a wall
 Or the moon
 Or my heart
 It is like the light coming through blue stained glass
 Yet not quite like it
 For the blueness is not transparent
 Only translucent
 Her souls light shines through
 But her soul cannot be seen
 It is something elusive whimsical tender wanton infantile wise
 And noble
 She wears Monsignore a blue garment
 Made in the manner of the Japanese
 It is very blue 
 I think that her eyes have made it more blue
 Sweetly staining it
 As the pressure of her body has graciously given it form
 Loving her Monsignore
 I love all her attributes
 But I believe
 That even if I did not love her
 I would love the blueness of her eyes
 And her blue garment made in the manner of the Japanese

 Monsignore
 I have never before troubled you with a request
 The saints whose ears I chiefly worry with my pleas
 are the most exquisite and maternal Brigid
 Gallant Saint Stephen who puts fire in my blood
 And your brother bishop my patron
 The generous and jovial Saint Nicholas of Bari
 But of your courtesy Monsignore
 Do me this favour
 When you this morning make your way
 To the Ivory Throne that bursts into bloom with roses
 because of her who sits upon it
 When you come to pay your devoir to Our Lady
 I beg you say to her
 Madame a poor poet one of your singing servants yet on earth
 Has asked me to say that at this moment he is especially grateful to you
 For wearing a blue gown




Houses

For Aline



 When you shall die and to the sky
 Serenely delicately go
 Saint Peter when he sees you there
 Will clash his keys and say
 Now talk to her Sir Christopher
 And hurry Michelangelo
 She wants to play at building
 And youve got to help her play

 Every architect will help erect
 A palace on a lawn of cloud
 With rainbow beams and a sunset roof
 And a level startiled floor
 And at your will you may use the skill
 Of this gay angelic crowd
 When a house is made you will throw it down
 And theyll build you twenty more

 For Christopher Wren and these other men
 Who used to build on earth
 Will love to go to work again
 If they may work for you
 This porch youll say should go this way
 And theyll work for all theyre worth
 And theyll come to your palace every morning
 And ask you what to do

 And when night comes down on Heaventown
 If there should be night up there
 You will choose the house you like the best
 Of all that you can see
 And its walls will glow as you drowsily go
 To the bed up the golden stair
 And I hope youll be gentle enough to keep
 A room in your house for me




In Memory



 I

 Serene and beautiful and very wise
 Most erudite in curious Grecian lore
 You lay and read your learned books and bore
 A weight of unshed tears and silent sighs
 The song within your heart could never rise
 Until love bade it spread its wings and soar
 Nor could you look on Beautys face before
 A poets burning mouth had touched your eyes

 Love is made out of ecstasy and wonder
 Love is a poignant and accustomed pain
 It is a burst of Heavenshaking thunder
 It is a linnets fluting after rain
 Loves voice is through your song above and under
 And in each note to echo and remain


 II

 Because Mankind is glad and brave and young
 Full of gay flames that white and scarlet glow
 All joys and passions that Mankind may know
 By you were nobly felt and nobly sung
 Because Mankinds heart every day is wrung
 By Fates wild hands that twist and tear it so
 Therefore you echoed Mans undying woe
 A harp Aeolian on Lifes branches hung

 So did the ghosts of toiling children hover
 About the piteous portals of your mind
 Your eyes that looked on glory could discover
 The angry scar to which the world was blind
 And it was grief that made Mankind your lover
 And it was grief that made you love Mankind


 III

 Before Christ left the Citadel of Light
 To tread the dreadful way of human birth
 His shadow sometimes fell upon the earth
 And those who saw it wept with joy and fright
 Thou art Apollo than the sun more bright
 They cried Our music is of little worth
 But thrill our blood with thy creative mirth
 Thou god of song thou lord of lyric might

 O singing pilgrim who could love and follow
 Your lover Christ through even loves despair
 You knew within the cypressdarkened hollow
 The feet that on the mountain are so fair
 For it was Christ that was your own Apollo
 And thorns were in the laurel on your hair




Apology

For Eleanor Rogers Cox



 For blows on the fort of evil
 That never shows a breach
 For terrible lifelong races
 To a goal no foot can reach
 For reckless leaps into darkness
 With hands outstretched to a star
 There is jubilation in Heaven
 Where the great dead poets are

 There is joy over disappointment
 And delight in hopes that were vain
 Each poet is glad there was no cure
 To stop his lonely pain
 For nothing keeps a poet
 In his high singing mood
 Like unappeasable hunger
 For unattainable food

 So fools are glad of the folly
 That made them weep and sing
 And Keats is thankful for Fanny Brawne
 And Drummond for his king
 They know that on flinty sorrow
 And failure and desire
 The steel of their souls was hammered
 To bring forth the lyric fire

 Lord Byron and Shelley and Plunkett
 McDonough and Hunt and Pearse
 See now why their hatred of tyrants
 Was so insistently fierce
 Is Freedom only a Willothewisp
 To cheat a poets eye
 Be it phantom or fact its a noble cause
 In which to sing and to die

 So not for the Rainbow taken
 And the magical White Bird snared
 The poets sing grateful carols
 In the place to which they have fared
 But for their lifetimes passion
 The quest that was fruitless and long
 They chorus their loud thanksgiving
 To the thorncrowned Master of Song




The Proud Poet

For Shaemas O Sheel



 One winter night a Devil came and sat upon my bed
 His eyes were full of laughter for his heart was full of crime
 Why dont you take up fancy work or embroidery he said
 For a needle is as manly a tool as a pen that makes a rhyme
 You little ugly Devil said I go back to Hell
 For the idea you express I will not listen to
 I have trouble enough with poetry and poverty as well
 Without having to pay attention to orators like you

 When you say of the making of ballads and songs that it is womans work
 You forget all the fighting poets that have been in every land
 There was Byron who left all his ladyloves to fight against the Turk
 And David the Singing King of the Jews
 who was born with a sword in his hand
 It was yesterday that Rupert Brooke went out to the Wars and died
 And Sir Philip Sidneys lyric voice was as sweet as his arm was strong
 And Sir Walter Raleigh met the axe as a lover meets his bride
 Because he carried in his soul the courage of his song

 And there is no consolation so quickening to the heart
 As the warmth and whiteness that come from the lines of noble poetry
 It is strong joy to read it when the wounds of the spirit smart
 It puts the flame in a lonely breast where only ashes be
 It is strong joy to read it and to make it is a thing
 That exalts a man with a sacreder pride than any pride on earth
 For it makes him kneel to a broken slave and set his foot on a king
 And it shakes the walls of his little soul with the echo of Gods mirth

 There was the poet Homer had the sorrow to be blind
 Yet a hundred people with good eyes would listen to him all night
 For they took great enjoyment in the heaven of his mind
 And were glad when the old blind poet let them share his powers of sight
 And there was Heine lying on his mattress all day long
 He had no wealth he had no friends he had no joy at all
 Except to pour his sorrow into little cups of song
 And the world finds in them the magic wine that his broken heart let fall

 And these are only a couple of names from a list of a thousand score
 Who have put their glory on the world in poverty and pain
 And the title of poets a noble thing worth living and dying for
 Though all the devils on earth and in Hell spit at me their disdain
 It is stern work it is perilous work to thrust your hand in the sun
 And pull out a spark of immortal flame to warm the hearts of men
 But Prometheus torn by the claws and beaks whose task is never done
 Would be tortured another eternity to go stealing fire again




Lionel Johnson

For the Rev John J Burke C S P



 There was a murkier tinge in Londons air
 As if the honest fog blushed black for shame
 Fools sang of sin for other fools acclaim
 And Miltons wreath was tossed to Baudelaire
 The flowers of evil blossomed everywhere
 But in their midst a radiant lily came
 Candescent pure a cup of living flame
 Bloomed for a day and left the earth more fair

 And was it Charles thy fair and fatal King
 Who bade thee welcome to the lovely land
 Or did Lord David cease to harp and sing
 To take in his thine emulative hand
 Or did Our Ladys smile shine forth to bring
 Her lyric Knight within her choir to stand




Father Gerard Hopkins S J



 Why didst thou carve thy speech laboriously
 And match and blend thy words with curious art
 For Song one saith is but a human heart
 Speaking aloud undisciplined and free
 Nay God be praised Who fixed thy task for thee
 Austere ecstatic craftsman set apart
 From all who traffic in Apollos mart
 On thy phrased paten shall the Splendour be

 Now carelessly we throw a rhyme to God
 Singing His praise when other songs are done
 But thou who knewest paths Teresa trod
 Losing thyself what is it thou hast won
 O bleeding feet with peace and glory shod
 O happy moth that flew into the Sun




Gates and Doors

For Richardson Little Wright



 There was a gentle hostler
 And blessed be his name
 He opened up the stable
 The night Our Lady came
 Our Lady and Saint Joseph
 He gave them food and bed
 And Jesus Christ has given him
 A glory round his head

 So let the gate swing open
 However poor the yard
 Lest weary people visit you
 And find their passage barred
 Unlatch the door at midnight
 And let your lanterns glow
 Shine out to guide the travelers feet
 To you across the snow

 There was a courteous hostler
 He is in Heaven tonight
 He held Our Ladys bridle
 And helped her to alight
 He spread clean straw before her
 Whereon she might lie down
 And Jesus Christ has given him
 An everlasting crown

 Unlock the door this evening
 And let your gate swing wide
 Let all who ask for shelter
 Come speedily inside
 What if your yard be narrow
 What if your house be small
 There is a Guest is coming
 Will glorify it all

 There was a joyous hostler
 Who knelt on Christmas morn
 Beside the radiant manger
 Wherein his Lord was born
 His heart was full of laughter
 His soul was full of bliss
 When Jesus on His Mothers lap
 Gave him His hand to kiss

 Unbar your heart this evening
 And keep no stranger out
 Take from your souls great portal
 The barrier of doubt
 To humble folk and weary
 Give hearty welcoming
 Your breast shall be tomorrow
 The cradle of a King




The Robe of Christ

For Cecil Chesterton



 At the foot of the Cross on Calvary
 Three soldiers sat and diced
 And one of them was the Devil
 And he won the Robe of Christ

 When the Devil comes in his proper form
 To the chamber where I dwell
 I know him and make the Sign of the Cross
 Which drives him back to Hell

 And when he comes like a friendly man
 And puts his hand in mine
 The fervour in his voice is not
 From love or joy or wine

 And when he comes like a woman
 With lovely smiling eyes
 Black dreams float over his golden head
 Like a swarm of carrion flies

 Now many a million tortured souls
 In his red halls there be
 Why does he spend his subtle craft
 In hunting after me

 Kings queens and crested warriors
 Whose memory rings through time
 These are his prey and what to him
 Is this poor man of rhyme

 That he with such laborious skill
 Should change from role to role
 Should daily act so many a part
 To get my little soul

 Oh he can be the forest
 And he can be the sun
 Or a buttercup or an hour of rest
 When the weary day is done

 I saw him through a thousand veils
 And has not this sufficed
 Now must I look on the Devil robed
 In the radiant Robe of Christ

 He comes and his face is sad and mild
 With thorns his head is crowned
 There are great bleeding wounds in his feet
 And in each hand a wound

 How can I tell who am a fool
 If this be Christ or no
 Those bleeding hands outstretched to me
 Those eyes that love me so

 I see the Robe  I look  I hope 
 I fear  but there is one
 Who will direct my troubled mind
 Christs Mother knows her Son

 O Mother of Good Counsel lend
 Intelligence to me
 Encompass me with wisdom
 Thou Tower of Ivory

 This is the Man of Lies she says
 Disguised with fearful art
 He has the wounded hands and feet
 But not the wounded heart

 Beside the Cross on Calvary
 She watched them as they diced
 She saw the Devil join the game
 And win the Robe of Christ




The Singing Girl

For the Rev Edward F Garesche S J



 There was a little maiden
 In blue and silver drest
 She sang to God in Heaven
 And God within her breast

 It flooded me with pleasure
 It pierced me like a sword
 When this young maiden sang My soul
 Doth magnify the Lord

 The stars sing all together
 And hear the angels sing
 But they said they had never heard
 So beautiful a thing

 Saint Mary and Saint Joseph
 And Saint Elizabeth
 Pray for us poets now
 And at the hour of death




The Annunciation

For Helen Parry Eden



 Hail Mary full of grace the Angel saith
 Our Lady bows her head and is ashamed
 She has a Bridegroom Who may not be named
 Her mortal flesh bears Him Who conquers death
 Now in the dust her spirit grovelleth
 Too bright a Sun before her eyes has flamed
 Too fair a herald joy too high proclaimed
 And human lips have trembled in Gods breath

 O MotherMaid thou art ashamed to cover
 With thy white self whereon no stain can be
 Thy God Who came from Heaven to be thy Lover
 Thy God Who came from Heaven to dwell in thee
 About thy head celestial legions hover
 Chanting the praise of thy humility




Roses

For Katherine Bregy



 I went to gather roses and twine them in a ring
 For I would make a posy a posy for the King
 I got an hundred roses the loveliest there be
 From the white rose vine and the pink rose bush and from the red rose tree

 But when I took my posy and laid it at His feet
 I found He had His roses a million times more sweet
 There was a scarlet blossom upon each foot and hand
 And a great pink rose bloomed from His side for the healing of the land

 Now of this fair and awful King there is this marvel told
 That He wears a crown of linked thorns instead of one of gold
 Where there are thorns are roses and I saw a line of red
 A little wreath of roses around His radiant head

 A red rose is His Sacred Heart a white rose is His face
 And His breath has turned the barren world to a rich and flowery place
 He is the Rose of Sharon His gardener am I
 And I shall drink His fragrance in Heaven when I die




The Visitation

For Louise Imogen Guiney



 There is a wall of flesh before the eyes
 Of John who yet perceives and hails his King
 It is Our Ladys painful bliss to bring
 Before mankind the Glory of the skies
 Her cousin feels her wombs sweet burden rise
 And leap with joy and she comes forth to sing
 With trembling mouth her words of welcoming
 She knows her hidden God and prophesies

 Saint John pray for us weary souls that tarry
 Where life is withered by sins deadly breath
 Pray for us whom the dogs of Satan harry
 Saint John Saint Anne and Saint Elizabeth
 And Mother Mary give us Christ to carry
 Within our hearts that we may conquer death




Multiplication

For S M E



 I take my leave with sorrow of Him I love so well
 I look my last upon His small and radiant prisoncell
 O happy lamp to serve Him with never ceasing light
 O happy flame to tremble forever in His sight

 I leave the holy quiet for the loudly human train
 And my heart that He has breathed upon is filled with lonely pain
 O King O Friend O Lover What sorer grief can be
 In all the reddest depths of Hell than banishment from Thee

 But from my window as I speed across the sleeping land
 I see the towns and villages wherein His houses stand
 Above the roofs I see a cross outlined against the night
 And I know that there my Lover dwells in His sacramental might

 Dominions kneel before Him and Powers kiss His feet
 Yet for me He keeps His weary watch in the turmoil of the street
 The King of Kings awaits me wherever I may go
 O who am I that He should deign to love and serve me so




Thanksgiving

For John Bunker



 The roar of the world is in my ears
 Thank God for the roar of the world
 Thank God for the mighty tide of fears
 Against me always hurled

 Thank God for the bitter and ceaseless strife
 And the sting of His chastening rod
 Thank God for the stress and the pain of life
 And Oh thank God for God




The Thorn

For the Rev Charles L ODonnell C S C



 The garden of God is a radiant place
 And every flower has a holy face
 Our Lady like a lily bends above the cloudy sod
 But Saint Michael is the thorn on the rosebush of God

 David is the song upon Gods lips
 And Our Lady is the goblet that He sips
 And Gabriels the breath of His command
 But Saint Michael is the sword in Gods right hand

 The Ivory Tower is fair to see
 And may her walls encompass me
 But when the Devil comes with the thunder of his might
 Saint Michael show me how to fight




The Big Top



 The boom and blare of the big brass band is cheering to my heart
 And I like the smell of the trampled grass and elephants and hay
 I take off my hat to the acrobat with his delicate strong art
 And the motley mirth of the chalkfaced clown drives all my care away

 I wish I could feel as they must feel these players brave and fair
 Who nonchalantly juggle death before a staring throng
 It must be fine to walk a line of silver in the air
 And to cleave a hundred feet of space with a gesture like a song

 Sir Henry Irving never knew a keener sweeter thrill
 Than that which stirs the breast of him who turns his painted face
 To the circling crowd who laugh aloud and clap hands with a will
 As a tribute to the clown who won the great wheelbarrow race

 Now one shall work in the living rock with a mallet and a knife
 And another shall dance on a big white horse that canters round a ring
 By anothers hand shall colours stand in similitude of life
 And the hearts of the three shall be moved by one mysterious high thing

 For the sculptor and the acrobat and the painter are the same
 They know one hope one fear one pride one sorrow and one mirth
 And they take delight in the endless fight for the fickle worlds acclaim
 For they worship art above the clouds and serve her on the earth

 But you who can build of the stubborn rock no form of loveliness
 Who can never mingle the radiant hues to make a wonder live
 Who can only show your little woe to the world in a rhythmic dress 
 What kind of a counterpart of you does the threering circus give

 Well  here in the little sideshow tent today some people stand
 One is a giant one a dwarf and one has a figured skin
 And each is scarred and seared and marred by Fates relentless hand
 And each one shows his grief for pay with a sort of pride therein

 You put your sorrow into rhyme and want the world to look
 You sing the news of your ruined hope and want the world to hear
 Their woe is pent in a canvas tent and yours in a printed book
 O poet of the broken heart salute your brothers here




Queen Elizabeth Speaks



 My hands were stained with blood my heart was proud and cold
 My soul is black with shame    but I gave Shakespeare gold
 So after aeons of flame I may by grace of God
 Rise up to kiss the dust that Shakespeares feet have trod




Midocean in Wartime

For My Mother



 The fragile splendour of the level sea
 The moons serene and silverveiled face
 Make of this vessel an enchanted place
 Full of white mirth and golden sorcery
 Now for a time shall careless laughter be
 Blended with song to lend song sweeter grace
 And the old stars in their unending race
 Shall heed and envy young humanity

 And yet tonight a hundred leagues away
 These waters blush a strange and awful red
 Before the moon a cloud obscenely grey
 Rises from decks that crash with flying lead
 And these stars smile their immemorial way
 On waves that shroud a thousand newly dead




In Memory of Rupert Brooke



 In alien earth across a troubled sea
 His body lies that was so fair and young
 His mouth is stopped with half his songs unsung
 His arm is still that struck to make men free
 But let no cloud of lamentation be
 Where on a warriors grave a lyre is hung
 We keep the echoes of his golden tongue
 We keep the vision of his chivalry

 So Israels joy the loveliest of kings
 Smote now his harp and now the hostile horde
 Today the starry roof of Heaven rings
 With psalms a soldier made to praise his Lord
 And David rests beneath Eternal wings
 Song on his lips and in his hand a sword




The New School

For My Mother



 The halls that were loud with the merry tread of young and careless feet
 Are still with a stillness that is too drear to seem like holiday
 And never a gust of laughter breaks the calm of the dreaming street
 Or rises to shake the ivied walls and frighten the doves away

 The dust is on book and on empty desk and the tennisracquet and balls
 Lie still in their lonely locker and wait for a game that is never played
 And over the study and lectureroom and the river and meadow falls
 A stern peace a strange peace a peace that War has made

 For many a youthful shoulder now is gay with an epaulet
 And the hand that was deft with a cricketbat is defter with a sword
 And some of the lads will laugh today where the trench is red and wet
 And some will win on the bloody field the accolade of the Lord

 They have taken their youth and mirth away
 from the study and playingground
 To a new school in an alien land beneath an alien sky
 Out in the smoke and roar of the fight their lessons and games are found
 And they who were learning how to live are learning how to die

 And after the golden day has come and the war is at an end
 A slab of bronze on the chapel wall will tell of the noble dead
 And every name on that radiant list will be the name of a friend
 A name that shall through the centuries in grateful prayers be said

 And there will be ghosts in the old school
 brave ghosts with laughing eyes
 On the field with a ghostly cricketbat by the stream with a ghostly rod
 They will touch the hearts of the living with a flame that sanctifies
 A flame that they took with strong young hands
 from the altarfires of God




Easter Week

In memory of Joseph Mary Plunkett


 Romantic Irelands dead and gone
 Its with OLeary in the grave
 William Butler Yeats



 Romantic Irelands dead and gone
 Its with OLeary in the grave
 Then Yeats what gave that Easter dawn
 A hue so radiantly brave

 There was a rain of blood that day
 Red rain in gay blue April weather
 It blessed the earth till it gave birth
 To valour thick as blooms of heather

 Romantic Ireland never dies
 OLeary lies in fertile ground
 And songs and spears throughout the years
 Rise up where patriot graves are found

 Immortal patriots newly dead
 And ye that bled in bygone years
 What banners rise before your eyes
 What is the tune that greets your ears

 The young Republics banners smile
 For many a mile where troops convene
 OConnell Street is loudly sweet
 With strains of Wearing of the Green

 The soil of Ireland throbs and glows
 With life that knows the hour is here
 To strike again like Irishmen
 For that which Irishmen hold dear

 Lord Edward leaves his resting place
 And Sarsfields face is glad and fierce
 See Emmet leap from troubled sleep
 To grasp the hand of Padraic Pearse

 There is no rope can strangle song
 And not for long death takes his toll
 No prison bars can dim the stars
 Nor quicklime eat the living soul

 Romantic Ireland is not old
 For years untold her youth will shine
 Her heart is fed on Heavenly bread
 The blood of martyrs is her wine




The Cathedral of Rheims

From the French of Emile Verhaeren



 He who walks through the meadows of Champagne
 At noon in Fall when leaves like gold appear
 Sees it draw near
 Like some great mountain set upon the plain
 From radiant dawn until the close of day
 Nearer it grows
 To him who goes
 Across the country When tall towers lay
 Their shadowy pall
 Upon his way
 He enters where
 The solid stone is hollowed deep by all
 Its centuries of beauty and of prayer

 Ancient French temple thou whose hundred kings
 Watch over thee emblazoned on thy walls
 Tell me within thy memoryhallowed halls
 What chant of triumph or what warsong rings
 Thou hast known Clovis and his Frankish train
 Whose mighty hand Saint Remys hand did keep
 And in thy spacious vault perhaps may sleep
 An echo of the voice of Charlemagne
 For God thou has known fear when from His side
 Men wandered seeking alien shrines and new
 But still the sky was bountiful and blue
 And thou wast crowned with Frances love and pride
 Sacred thou art from pinnacle to base
 And in thy panes of gold and scarlet glass
 The setting sun sees thousandfold his face
 Sorrow and joy in stately silence pass
 Across thy walls the shadow and the light
 Around thy lofty pillars tapers white
 Illuminate with delicate sharp flames
 The brows of saints with venerable names
 And in the night erect a fiery wall
 A great but silent fervour burns in all
 Those simple folk who kneel pathetic dumb
 And know that down below beside the Rhine 
 Cannon horses soldiers flags in line 
 With blare of trumpets mighty armies come

 Suddenly each knows fear
 Swift rumours pass that every one must hear
 The hostile banners blaze against the sky
 And by the embassies mobs rage and cry
 Now war has come and peace is at an end
 On Paris town the German troops descend
 They are turned back and driven to Champagne
 And now as to so many weary men
 The glorious temple gives them welcome when
 It meets them at the bottom of the plain

 At once they set their cannon in its way
 There is no gable now nor wall
 That does not suffer night and day
 As shot and shell in crushing torrents fall
 The stricken tocsin quivers through the tower
 The triple nave the apse the lonely choir
 Are circled hour by hour
 With thundering bands of fire
 And Death is scattered broadcast among men

 And then
 That which was splendid with baptismal grace
 The stately arches soaring into space
 The transepts columns windows gray and gold
 The organ in whose tones the ocean rolled
 The crypts of mighty shades the dwelling places
 The Virgins gentle hands the Saints pure faces
 All even the pardoning hands of Christ the Lord
 Were struck and broken by the wanton sword
 Of sacrilegious lust

 O beauty slain O glory in the dust
 Strong walls of faith most basely overthrown
 The crawling flames like adders glistening
 Ate the white fabric of this lovely thing
 Now from its soul arose a piteous moan
 The soul that always loved the just and fair
 Granite and marble loud their woe confessed
 The silver monstrances that Popes had blessed
 The chalices and lamps and crosiers rare
 Were seared and twisted by a flaming breath
 The horror everywhere did range and swell
 The guardian Saints into this furnace fell
 Their bitter tears and screams were stilled in death

 Around the flames armed hosts are skirmishing
 The burning sun reflects the lurid scene
 The German army fighting for its life
 Rallies its torn and terrified left wing
 And as they near this place
 The imperial eagles see
 Before them in their flight
 Here in the solemn night
 The old cathedral to the years to be
 Showing with wounded arms their own disgrace




Kings

For the Rev James B Dollard



 The Kings of the earth are men of might
 And cities are burned for their delight
 And the skies rain death in the silent night
 And the hills belch death all day

 But the King of Heaven Who made them all
 Is fair and gentle and very small
 He lies in the straw by the oxens stall 
 Let them think of Him today




The White Ships and the Red

For Alden March



 With drooping sail and pennant
 That never a wind may reach
 They float in sunless waters
 Beside a sunless beach
 Their mighty masts and funnels
 Are white as driven snow
 And with a pallid radiance
 Their ghostly bulwarks glow

 Here is a Spanish galleon
 That once with gold was gay
 Here is a Roman trireme
 Whose hues outshone the day
 But Tyrian dyes have faded
 And prows that once were bright
 With rainbow stains wear only
 Deaths livid dreadful white

 White as the ice that clove her
 That unforgotten day
 Among her pallid sisters
 The grim Titanic lay
 And through the leagues above her
 She looked aghast and said
 What is this living ship that comes
 Where every ship is dead

 The ghostly vessels trembled
 From ruined stern to prow
 What was this thing of terror
 That broke their vigil now
 Down through the startled ocean
 A mighty vessel came
 Not white as all dead ships must be
 But red like living flame

 The pale green waves about her
 Were swiftly strangely dyed
 By the great scarlet stream that flowed
 From out her wounded side
 And all her decks were scarlet
 And all her shattered crew
 She sank among the white ghost ships
 And stained them through and through

 The grim Titanic greeted her
 And who art thou she said
 Why dost thou join our ghostly fleet
 Arrayed in living red
 We are the ships of sorrow
 Who spend the weary night
 Until the dawn of Judgment Day
 Obscure and still and white

 Nay said the scarlet visitor
 Though I sink through the sea
 A ruined thing that was a ship
 I sink not as did ye
 For ye met with your destiny
 By storm or rock or fight
 So through the lagging centuries
 Ye wear your robes of white

 But never crashing iceberg
 Nor honest shot of foe
 Nor hidden reef has sent me
 The way that I must go
 My wound that stains the waters
 My blood that is like flame
 Bear witness to a loathly deed
 A deed without a name

 I went not forth to battle
 I carried friendly men
 The children played about my decks
 The women sang  and then 
 And then  the sun blushed scarlet
 And Heaven hid its face
 The world that God created
 Became a shameful place

 My wrong cries out for vengeance
 The blow that sent me here
 Was aimed in Hell My dying scream
 Has reached Jehovahs ear
 Not all the seven oceans
 Shall wash away that stain
 Upon a brow that wears a crown
 I am the brand of Cain

 When Gods great voice assembles
 The fleet on Judgment Day
 The ghosts of ruined ships will rise
 In sea and strait and bay
 Though they have lain for ages
 Beneath the changeless flood
 They shall be white as silver
 But one  shall be like blood
