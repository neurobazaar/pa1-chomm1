Welcome to the World of the Internet

 The Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF is proud to have sponsored
the production of the Big Dummys Guide to the Internet EFF is a
nonprofit organization based in Washington DC dedicated to ensuring
that everyone has access to the newly emerging communications technologies
vital to active participation in the events of our world As more and more
information is available online new doors open up for those who have
access to that information Unfortunately unless access is broadly
encouraged individuals can be disenfranchised and doors can close as
well The Big Dummys Guide to the Internet was written to help open some
doors to the vast amounts of information available on the worlds largest
network the Internet
 The spark for the Big Dummys Guide to the Internet was ignited in
a few informal conversations that included myself and Steve Cisler of Apple
Computer Inc in June of 1991 With the support of Apple Computer EFF
engaged Adam Gaffin to write the book and actually took on the project in
September of 1991
 The idea was to write a guide to the Internet for people who had
little or no experience with network communications We intended to post
this guide to the Net in ASCII and HyperCard formats and to give it away on
disk as well as have a print edition available We have more than
realized our goal Individuals from as geographically far away as Germany
Italy Canada South Africa Japan Scotland Norway and Antarctica have
all sent electronic mail to say that they downloaded the Big Dummys Guide
to the Internet The guide is now available in a wide array of formats
including ACSCII text HyperCard World Wide Web PostScript and
AmigaGuide And the guide will be published in a printed format by MIT
Press in June of 1994
 EFF would like to thank author Adam Gaffin for doing a terrific job
of explaining the Net in such a nonthreatening way Wed also like to
thank the folks at Apple especially Steve Cisler of the Apple Library for
their support of our efforts to bring this guide to you
 We invite you to join with EFF in our fight to ensure that equal
access to the networks and free speech are protected in newly emerging
technologies We are a membership organization and through donations like
yours we can continue to sponsor important projects to make communications
easier Information about the Electronic Frontier Foundation and some of
the work that we do can be found at the end of this book
 We hope that the Big Dummys Guide to the Internet helps you learn
about whole new worlds where new friends and experiences are sure to be
yours Enjoy

Preface
By Adam Gaffin
Senior Writer Network World Framingham Mass

 Welcome to the Internet Youre about to start a journey through a
unique land without frontiers a place that is everywhere at once  even
though it exists physically only as a series of electrical impulses
Youll be joining a growing community of millions of people around the
world who use this global resource on a daily basis
 With this book you will be able to use the Internet to

  Stay in touch with friends relatives and colleagues around the
 world at a fraction of the cost of phone calls or even air
 mail

  Discuss everything from archaeology to zoology with people in
 several different languages

  Tap into thousands of information databases and libraries
 worldwide

  Retrieve any of thousands of documents journals books and
 computer programs

  Stay up to date with wireservice news and sports and
 with official weather reports

  Play live real time games with dozens of other people at once

 Connecting to the Net today takes something of a sense of
adventure a willingness to learn and an ability to take a deep breath
every once in awhile Visiting the Net today is a lot like journeying to
a foreign country There are so many things to see and do but
everything at first will seem so well foreign
 When you first arrive you wont be able to read the street signs
Youll get lost If youre unlucky you may even run into some locals
whod just as soon you went back to where you came from If this
werent enough the entire country is constantly under construction
every day it seems like theres something new for you to figure out
 Fortunately most of the locals are actually friendly In fact the
Net actually has a rich tradition of helping out visitors and newcomers
Until very recently there were few written guides for ordinary people
and the Net grew largely through an oral tradition in which the old
timers helped the newcomers
 So when you connect dont be afraid to ask for help Youll be
surprised at how many people will lend a hand
 Without such folks in fact this guide would not be possible My
thanks to all the people who have written with suggestion additions and
corrections since the Big Dummys Guide first appeared on the Internet in
1993
 Special thanks go to my loving wife Nancy I would also like to
thank the following people who whether they know it or not provided
particular help
 Rhonda Chapman Jim Cocks Tom Czarnik Christopher Davis David
DeSimone Jeanne deVoto Phil Eschallier Nico Garcia Joe Granrose
Joerg Heitkoetter Joe Ilacqua Jonathan Kamens Peter Kaminski Thomas
A Kreeger Stanton McCandlish Leanne Phillips Nancy Reynolds Helen
Trillian Rose Barry Shein Jennifer Moira Smith Gerard van der Leun
and Scott Yanoff

better Id love to hear them You can reach me via email at

Chapter 1 SETTING UP AND JACKING IN




11 READY SET 

 The world is just a phone call away With a computer and modem
youll be able to connect to the Internet the worlds largest computer
network and if youre lucky you wont even need the modem many
colleges and companies now give their students or employees direct access
to the Internet
 The phone line can be your existing voice line  just remember
that if you have any extensions you and everybody else in the house
or office wont be able to use them for voice calls while you are connected
to the Net
 A modem is a sort of translator between computers and the phone
system Its needed because computers and the phone system process and
transmit data or information in two different and incompatible
ways Computers talk digitally that is they store and process
information as a series of discrete numbers The phone network relies
on analog signals which on an oscilloscope would look like a series
of waves When your computer is ready to transmit data to another
computer over a phone line your modem converts the computer numbers
into these waves which sound like a lot of screeching  it
modulates them In turn when information waves come into your
modem it converts them into numbers your computer can process by
demodulating them
 Increasingly computers come with modems already installed If
yours didnt youll have to decide what speed modem to get Modem
speeds are judged in bps rate or bits per second One bps means
the modem can transfer roughly one bit per second the greater the
bps rate the more quickly a modem can send and receive information
A letter or character is made up of eight bits
 You can now buy a 2400bps modem for well under 60  and most now
come with the ability to handle fax messages as well At prices that now
start around 150 you can buy a modem that can transfer data at 14400
bps and often even faster using special compression techniques If you
think you might be using the Net to transfer large numbers of files a
faster modem is always worth the price It will dramatically reduce the
amount of time your modem or computer is tied up transferring files and if
you are paying for Net access by the hour will save you quite a bit in
online charges
 Like the computer to which it attaches a modem is useless
without software to tell it how to work Most modems today come with
easytoinstall software Try the program out If you find it
difficult to use or understand consider a trip to the local software
store to find a better program You can spend several hundred dollars
on a communications program but unless you have very specialized
needs this will be a waste of money as there are a host of excellent
programs available for around 100 or less Among the basic features you
want to look for are a choice of different protocols more on them in a
bit for transferring files to and from the Net and the ability to write
script or command files that let you automate such steps as logging
into a host system
 When you buy a modem and the software ask the dealer how to
install and use them Try out the software if you can If the dealer
cant help you find another dealer Youll not only save yourself a
lot of frustration youll also have practiced the prime Internet
directive Ask People Know
 To fully take advantage of the Net you must spend a few minutes
going over the manuals or documentation that comes with your software
There are a few things you should pay special attention to uploading
and downloading screen capturing sometimes called screen dumping
logging how to change protocols and terminal emulation It is also
essential to know how to convert a file created with your word
processing program into ASCII or text format which will let you
share your thoughts with others across the Net
 Uploading is the process of sending a file from your computer to a
system on the Net Downloading is retrieving a file from somewhere on
the Net to your computer In general things in cyberspace go up to
the Net and come down to you
 Chances are your software will come with a choice of several
protocols to use for these transfers These protocols are systems
designed to ensure that line noise or static does not cause errors that
could ruin whatever information you are trying to transfer
Essentially when using a protocol you are transferring a file in a
series of pieces After each piece is sent or received your computer
and the Net system compare it If the two pieces dont match exactly
they transfer it again until they agree that the information they both
have is identical If after several tries the information just
doesnt make it across youll either get an error message or your
screen will freeze In that case try it again If after five tries
you are still stymied something is wrong with a the file b the
telephone line c the system youre connected to or d your own
computer
 From time to time you will likely see messages on the Net that
you want to save for later viewing  a recipe a particularly witty
remark something you want to write your congressman about whatever
This is where screen capturing and logging come in
 When you tell your communications software to capture a screen it
opens a file in your computer usually in the same directory or folder
used by the software and dumps an image of whatever happens to be
on your screen at the time
 Logging works a bit differently When you issue a logging
command you tell the software to open a file again usually in the
same directory or folder as used by the software and then give it a
name Then until you turn off the logging command everything that
scrolls on your screen is copied into that file sort of like
recording on videotape This is useful for capturing long documents
that scroll for several pages  using screen capture you would have
to repeat the same command for each new screen
 Terminal emulation is a way for your computer to mimic or
emulate the way other computers put information on the screen and
accept commands from a keyboard In general most systems on the Net
use a system called VT100 Fortunately almost all communications
programs now on the market support this system as well  make sure
yours does
 Youll also have to know about protocols There are several
different ways for computers to transmit characters Fortunately
there are only two protocols that youre likely to run across 81N
which stands for 8 bits 1 stop bit no parity  yikes and 71E
7 bits 1 stop bit even parity
 In general Unixbased systems use 71E while MSDOSbased
systems use 81N What if you dont know what kind of system youre
connecting to Try one of the settings If you get what looks like
gobbledygook when you connect you may need the other setting
If so you can either change the setting while connected and then hit
enter or hang up and try again with the other setting Its also
possible your modem and the modem at the other end cant agree on the
right bps rate If changing the protocols doesnt work try using
another bps rate but no faster than the one listed for your modem
Dont worry remember you cant break anything If something looks wrong
it probably is wrong Change your settings and try again Nothing is
learned without trial error and effort
 There are the basics Now on to the Net


12 GO


 Once only people who studied or worked at an institution
directly tied to the Net could connect to the world Today though
an evergrowing number of publicaccess systems provide access for
everybody These systems can now be found in several states and there
are a couple of sites that can provide access across the country
 There are two basic kinds of these host systems The more common
one is known as a UUCP site UUCP being a common way to transfer
information among computers using the Unix operating system and
offers access to international electronic mail and conferences
 However recent years have seen the growth of more powerful sites
that let you tap into the full power of the Net These Internet sites
not only give you access to electronic mail and conferences but to
such services as databases libraries and huge file and program
collections around the world They are also fast  as soon as you
finish writing a message it gets zapped out to its destination
 Some sites are run by forprofit companies others by nonprofit
organizations Some of these publicaccess or host systems are
free of charge Others charge a monthly or yearly fee for unlimited
access And a few charge by the hour Systems that charge for access
will usually let you sign up online with a credit card Some also let
you set up a billing system
 But cost should be only one consideration in choosing a host
system especially if you live in an area with more than one provider
Most systems let you look around before you sign up What is the range
of each of their services How easy is each to use What kind of support or
help can you get from the system administrators
 The last two questions are particularly important because many
systems provide no user interface at all when you connect you are
dumped right into the Unix operating system If youre already
familiar with Unix or you want to learn how to use it these systems
offer phenomenal power  in addition to Net access most also let you
tap into the power of Unix to do everything from compiling your own
programs to playing online games
 But if you dont want to have to learn Unix there are other
publicaccess systems that work through menus just like the ones in
restaurants you are shown a list of choices and then you make your
selection of what you want or which provide a user interface that
is easier to figure out than the ever cryptic Unix
 If you dont want or need access to the full range of Internet
services a UUCP site makes good financial sense They tend to charge
less than commercial Internet providers although their messages may
not go out as quickly
 Some systems also have their own unique local services which can
range from extensive conferences to large file libraries


13 PUBLICACCESS INTERNET PROVIDERS


 When you have your communications program dial one of these host
systems one of two things will happen when you connect Youll
either see a lot of gibberish on your screen or youll be asked to
log in If you see gibberish chances are you have to change your
softwares parameters to 71E or 81N as the case may be Hang
up make the change and then dial in again
 When youve connected chances are youll see something like
this

 Welcome to THE WORLD
 Public Access UNIX for the 90s
 Login as new if you do not have an account

 login

 That last line is a prompt asking you to do something Since
this is your first call type

 new

and hit enter Often when youre asked to type something by a host
system youll be told what to type in quotation marks for example
new Dont include the quotation marks Repeat Dont
include the quotation marks
 What you see next depends on the system but will generally
consist of information about its costs and services you might want to
turn on your communication softwares logging function to save this
information Youll likely be asked if you want to establish an
account now or just look around the system
 Youll also likely be asked for your user name This is not
your full name but a oneword name you want to use while online It
can be any combination of letters or numbers all in lower case Many
people use their first initial and last name for example
jdoe their first name and the first letter of their last name
for example johnd or their initials jxd Others use a
nickname You might want to think about this for a second because this
user name will become part of your electronicmail address see chapter
2 for more on that The one exception are the various FreeNet
systems all of which assign you a user name consisting of an arbitrary
sequence of letters and numbers
 You are now on the Net Look around the system See if there
are any help files for you to read If its a menubased host system
choose different options just to see what happens Remember You cant
break anything The more you play the more comfortable youll be
 What follows is a list of publicaccess Internet sites which are
computer systems that offer access to the Net All offer international
email and Usenet international conferences In addition they offer

 FTP Filetransfer protocol  access to hundreds of file
 libraries everything from computer software to historical
 documents to song lyrics Youll be able to transfer
 these files from the Net to your own computer

 Telnet Access to databases computerized library card
 catalogs weather reports and other information services
 as well as live online games that let you compete with
 players from around the world

 Additional services that may be offered include

 WAIS Widearea Information Server a program that
 can search dozens of databases in one search

 Gopher A program that gives you easy access to dozens
 of other online databases and services by making
 selections on a menu Youll also be able to use these
 to copy text files and some programs to your mailbox

 IRC Internet Relay Chat a CB simulator that lets
 you have live keyboard chats with people around the
 world

 However even on systems that do not provide these services
directly you will be able to use a number of them through telnet see
Chapter 6 In the list that follows
systems that let you access services through menus are noted otherwise
assume that when you connect youll be dumped right into Unix aka
MSDOS with a college degree Several of these sites are available
nationwide through national data networks such as the CompuServe Packet
Network and SprintNet
 Please note that all listed charges are subject to change Many
sites require new or prospective users to log on a particular way on
their first call this list provides the name youll use in such cases

15 NET ORIGINS


 In the 1960s researchers began experimenting with linking computers
to each other and to people through telephone hookups using funds from
the US Defense Departments Advanced Research Projects Agency ARPA
 ARPA wanted to see if computers in different locations could be
linked using a new technology known as packet switching This technology
in which data meant for another location is broken up into little pieces
each with its own forwarding address had the promise of letting several
users share just one communications line Just as important from ARPAs
viewpoint was that this allowed for creation of networks that could
automatically route data around downed circuits or computers ARPAs
goal was not the creation of todays international computerusing
community but development of a data network that could survive a nuclear
attack
 Previous computer networking efforts had required a line between
each computer on the network sort of like a onetrack train route The
packet system allowed for creation of a data highway in which large
numbers of vehicles could essentially share the same lane Each packet
was given the computer equivalent of a map and a time stamp so that it
could be sent to the right destination where it would then be
reassembled into a message the computer or a human could use
 This system allowed computers to share data and the researchers to
exchange electronic mail or email In itself email was something
of a revolution offering the ability to send detailed letters at the
speed of a phone call
 As this system known as ARPANet grew some enterprising college
students and one in high school developed a way to use it to conduct
online conferences These started as scienceoriented discussions but
they soon branched out into virtually every other field as people
recognized the power of being able to talk to hundreds or even
thousands of people around the country
 In the 1970s ARPA helped support the development of rules or
protocols for transferring data between different types of computer
networks These internet from internetworking protocols made it
possible to develop the worldwide Net we have today that links all sorts
of computers across national boundaries By the close of the 1970s links
developed between ARPANet and counterparts in other countries The world
was now tied together in a computer web
 In the 1980s this network of networks which became known
collectively as the Internet expanded at a phenomenal rate Hundreds
then thousands of colleges research companies and government agencies
began to connect their computers to this worldwide Net Some
enterprising hobbyists and companies unwilling to pay the high costs of
Internet access or unable to meet stringent government regulations for
access learned how to link their own systems to the Internet even if
only for email and conferences Some of these systems began
offering access to the public Now anybody with a computer and modem 
and persistence  could tap into the world
 In the 1990s the Net continues to grow at exponential rates Some
estimates are that the volume of messages transferred through the Net
grows 20 percent a month In response government and other users have
tried in recent years to expand the Net itself Once the main Net
backbone in the US moved data at 56000 bits per second That proved
too slow for the ever increasing amounts of data being sent over it and
in recent years the maximum speed was increased to 15 million and then
45 million bits per second Even before the Net was able to reach that
latter speed however Net experts were already figuring out ways to pump
data at speeds of up to 2 billion bits per second  fast enough to send
the entire Encyclopedia Britannica across the country in just one or two
seconds Another major change has been the development of commercial
services that provide internetworking services at speeds comparable to
those of the government system In fact by mid1994 the US
government will remove itself from any daytoday control over the
workings of the Net as regional and national providers continue to
expand


16 HOW IT WORKS


 The worldwide Net is actually a complex web of smaller regional
networks To understand it picture a modern road network of trans
continental superhighways connecting large cities From these large cities
come smaller freeways and parkways to link together small towns whose
residents travel on slower narrow residential ways
 The Net superhighway is the highspeed Internet Connected to
this are computers that use a particular system of transferring data
at high speeds In the US the major Internet backbone
theoretically can move data at rates of 45 million bits per second
compare this to the average home modem which has a top speed of roughly
9600 to 14400 bits per second
 Connected to the backbone computers are smaller networks serving
particular geographic regions which generally move data at speeds
around 15 million bits per second
 Feeding off these in turn are even smaller networks or individual
computers
 Unlike with commercial networks such as CompuServe or Prodigy there
is no one central computer or computers running the Internet  its
resources are to be found among thousands of individual computers This
is both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness The approach
means it is virtually impossible for the entire Net to crash at once 
even if one computer shuts down the rest of the network stays up The
design also reduces the costs for an individual or organization to get
onto the network But thousands of connected computers can also make it
difficult to navigate the Net and find what you want  especially as
different computers may have different commands for plumbing their
resources It is only recently that Net users have begun to develop the
sorts of navigational tools and maps that will let neophytes get around
without getting lost
 Nobody really knows how many computers and networks actually make
up this Net Some estimates say there are now as many as 5000
networks connecting nearly 2 million computers and more than 15 million
people around the world Whatever the actual numbers however it is
clear they are only increasing
 The Net is more than just a technological marvel It is human
communication at its most fundamental level The pace may be a little
quicker when the messages race around the world in a few seconds but
its not much different from a large and interesting party Youll see
things in cyberspace that will make you laugh youll see things that
will anger you Youll read silly little snippets and new ideas that
make you think Youll make new friends and meet people you wish would
just go away
 Major network providers continue to work on ways to make it
easier for users of one network to communicate with those of another
Work is underway on a system for providing a universal white pages
in which you could look up somebodys electronicmail address for
example This connectivity trend will likely speed up in coming years
as users begin to demand seamless network access much as telephone
users can now dial almost anywhere in the world without worrying about
how many phone companies actually have to connect their calls
 And today the links grow ever closer between the Internet and such
commercial networks as CompuServe and Prodigy whose users can now
exchange electronic mail with their Internet friends Some commercial
providers such as Delphi and America Online are working to bring their
subscribers direct access to Internet services
 And as it becomes easier to use more and more people will join
this worldwide community we call the Net
 Being connected to the Net takes more than just reading
conferences and logging messages to your computer it takes asking and
answering questions exchanging opinions  getting involved
 If you choose to go forward to use and contribute you will become
a citizen of Cyberspace If youre reading these words for the first
time this may seem like an amusing but unlikely notion  that one
could inhabit a place without physical space But put a mark beside
these words Join the Net and actively participate for a year Then
reread this passage It will no longer seem so strange to be a
citizen of Cyberspace It will seem like the most natural thing in
the world
 And that leads to another fundamental thing to remember

 You cant break the Net

 As you travel the Net your computer may freeze your screen may
erupt into a mass of gibberish You may think youve just disabled a
milliondollar computer somewhere  or even your own personal
computer Sooner or later this feeling happens to everyone  and
likely more than once But the Net and your computer are hardier than
you think so relax You can no more break the Net than you can the
phone system If something goes wrong try again If nothing at all
happens you can always disconnect If worse comes to worse you can
turn off your computer Then take a deep breath And dial right back
in Leave a note for the person who runs the computer to which youve
connected to ask for advice Try it again Persistence pays
 Stay and contribute The Net will be richer for it  and so will
you


17 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

  Your computer connects with a publicaccess site and get gibberish
on your screen
 If you are using parameters of 81N try 71e or viceversa If
that doesnt work try another modem speed
  You have your computer dial a publicaccess site but nothing
happens
 Check the phone number you typed in If correct turn on your modems
speaker on Hayescompatible modems you can usually do this by typing ATM1
in your communications softwares terminal mode If the phone just
rings and rings the publicaccess site could be down for maintenance or
due to a crash or some other problem If you get a connect message but
nothing else try hitting enter or escape a couple of times
  You try to log in but after you type your password nothing
happens or you get a timed out message followed by a disconnect
 Redial the number and try it again
  Always remember if you have a problem that just doesnt go away
ask Ask your system administrator ask a friend but ask Somebody will
know what to do


18 FYI


 The Net grows so fast that even the best guide to its resources
would be somewhat outdated the day it was printed At the end of each
chapter however youll find FYI pointers to places on the Net where you
can go for more information or to keep updated on new resources and
services
 Peter Kaminski maintains a list of systems that provide public
access to Internet services Its availble on the network itself which
obviously does you little good if you currently have no access but which
can prove invaluable should you move or want to find a new system Look
for his PDIAL file in the altbbslists or newsanswers newsgroups in
Usenet for information on accessing Usenet see Chapter 3
 Steven Levys book Hackers Heroes of the Computer Revolution
Anchor PressDoubleday 1984 describes the early culture and ethos
that ultimately resulted in the Internet and Usenet
 John Quartermans The Matrix Computer Networks and Conferencing
Systems Worldwide Digital Press 1990 is an exhaustive look at
computer networks and how they connect with each other
 Youll find numerous documents about the Internet its history and
its resources in the pubNet_info directory on the Electronic Frontier
Foundations FTP server see chapter 7 to decipher this






Chapter 2 EMAIL




21 THE BASICS


 Electronic mail or email is your personal connection to the
world of the Net
 All of the millions of people around the world who use the
Net have their own email addresses A growing number of gateways tie
more and more people to the Net every day When you logged onto the host
system you are now using it automatically generated an address for you
as well
 The basic concepts behind email parallel those of regular mail
You send mail to people at their particular addresses In turn they
write to you at your email address You can subscribe to the
electronic equivalent of magazines and newspapers You might even get
electronic junk mail
 Email has two distinct advantages over regular mail The most
obvious is speed Instead of several days your message can reach the
other side of the world in hours minutes or even seconds depending on
where you drop off your mail and the state of the connections between
there and your recipient The other advantage is that once you master
the basics youll be able to use email to access databases and file
libraries Youll see how to do this later along with learning how to
transfer program and data files through email
 Email also has advantages over the telephone You send your
message when its convenient for you Your recipients respond at their
convenience No more telephone tag And while a phone call across
the country or around the world can quickly result in huge phone
bills email lets you exchange vast amounts of mail for only a few
pennies  even if the other person is in New Zealand
 Email is your connection to help  your Net lifeline The
Net can sometimes seem a frustrating place No matter how hard you
try no matter where you look you just might not be able to find the
answer to whatever is causing you problems But when you know how to
use email help is often just a few keystrokes away you can ask your
system administrator or a friend for help in an email message
 The quickest way to start learning email is to send yourself a
message Most publicaccess sites actually have several different types
of mail systems all of which let you both send and receive mail Well
start with the simplest one known appropriately enough as mail and
then look at a couple of other interfaces At your host systems command
prompt type

 mail username

where username is the name you gave yourself when you first logged on
Hit enter The computer might respond with

 subject

 Type

 test

or actually anything at all but youll have to hit enter before
you get to the end of the screen Hit enter
 The cursor will drop down a line You can now begin writing the
actual message Type a sentence again anything at all And heres
where you hit your first Unix frustration one that will bug you
repeatedly you have to hit enter before you get to the very end of the
line Just like typewriters many Unix programs have no wordwrapping
although there are ways to get some Unix text processors such as emacs
to wordwrap
 When done with your message hit return Now hit controlD the
control and the D keys at the same time This is a Unix command that
tells the computer youre done writing and that it should close your
envelope and mail it off you could also hit enter once and then on
a blank line type a period at the beginning of the line and hit enter
again
 Youve just sent your first email message And because youre
sending mail to yourself rather than to someone somewhere else on the
Net your message has already arrived as well see in a moment
 If you had wanted you could have even written your message on
your own computer and then uploaded it into this electronic
envelope There are a couple of good reasons to do this with long
or involved messages One is that once you hit enter at the end of a
line in mail you cant readily fix any mistakes on that line unless
you use some special commands to call up a Unix text processor Also
if you are paying for access by the hour uploading a prepared
message can save you money Remember to save the document in ASCII or
text format Uploading a document youve created in a word processor
that uses special formatting commands which these days means many
programs will cause strange effects
 When you get that blank line after the subject line upload the
message using the ASCII protocol Or you can copy and paste the text
if your software allows that When done hit controlD as above
 Now you have mail waiting for you Normally when you log on
your publicaccess site will tell you whether you have new mail
waiting To open your mailbox and see your waiting mail type

 mail

and hit enter
 When the host system sees mail without a name after it it
knows you want to look in your mailbox rather than send a message
Your screen on a plainvanilla Unix system will display

 Mail version SMI 40 Mon Apr 24 183415 PDT 1989 Type  for help
 usrspoolmailadamg 1 message 1 new 1 unread

 N 1 adamg Sat Jan 15 2004 12290 test

 Ignore the first line its just computerese of value only to the
people who run your system You can type a question mark and hit
return but unless youre familiar with Unix most of what youll see
wont make much sense at this point
 The second line tells you the directory on the host system where
your mail messages are put which again is not something youll likely
need to know The second line also tells you how many messages are in your
mailbox how many have come in since the last time you looked and how
many messages you havent read yet
 Its the third line that is of real interest  it tells you who
the message is from when it arrived how many lines and characters
it takes up and what the subject is The N means it is a new
message  it arrived after the last time you looked in your mailbox
Hit enter And theres your message  only now its a lot
longer than what you wrote

 Subject test
 Status R

 This is only a test

 Whoa What is all that stuff Its your message with a postmark
gone mad Just as the postal service puts its marks on every piece of
mail it handles so do Net postal systems Only its called a
header instead of a postmark Each system that handles or routes
your mail puts its stamp on it Since many messages go through a
number of systems on their way to you you will often get messages
with headers that seem to go on forever Among other things a header
will tell you exactly when a message was sent and received even the
difference between your local time and Greenwich Mean Time  as at the end
of line 4 above
 If this had been a long message it would just keep scrolling
across and down your screen  unless the people who run your public
access site have set it up to pause every 24 lines One way to deal
with a message that doesnt stop is to use your telecommunication
softwares logging or textbuffer function Start it before you hit
the number of the message you want to see Your computer will ask you
what you want to call the file youre about to create After you name
the file and hit enter type the number of the message you want to see
and hit enter When the message finishes scrolling turn off the
textbuffer function The message is now saved in your computer
This way you can read the message while not connected to the Net
which can save you money if youre paying by the hour and write a
reply offline
 But in the meantime now what You can respond to the message
delete it or save it To respond type a lowercase r and hit
enter Youll get something like this

 To adamg
 Subject Re test

 Note that this time you dont have to enter a user name The
computer takes it from the message youre replying to and
automatically addresses your message to its sender The computer also
automatically inserts a subject line by adding Re to the original
subject From here its just like writing a new message But say you
change your mind and decide not to reply after all How do you get out
of the message Hit controlC once Youll get this

 Interrupt  one more to kill letter

If you hit controlC once more the message will disappear and youll
get back to your mails command line
 Now if you type a lowercase d and then hit enter youll
delete the original message Type a lowercase q to exit your
mailbox
 If you type a q without first hitting d your message is
transferred to a file called mbox This file is where all read but
undeleted messages go If you want to leave it in your mailbox for
now type a lowercase x and hit enter This gets you out of mail
without making any changes
 The mbox file works a lot like your mailbox To access it
type

 mail f mbox

at your host systems command line and hit enter
 Youll get a menu identical to the one in your mailbox from which
you can read these old messages delete them or respond to them Its
probably a good idea to clear out your mailbox and mbox file from
time to time if only to keep them uncluttered
 Are there any drawbacks to email There are a few One is that
people seem more willing to fly off the handle electronically than in
person or over the phone Maybe its because its so easy to hit r
and reply to a message without pausing and reflecting a moment
Thats why we have smileys see section 24 Theres no online
equivalent yet of a return receipt chances are your message got to where
its going but theres no absolute way for you to know for sure unless
you get a reply from the other person
 So now youre ready to send email to other people on the Net
Of course you need somebodys address to send them mail How do you
get it
 Alas the simplest answer is not what youd call the most
elegant you call them up on the phone or write them a letter on paper
and ask them Residents of the electronic frontier are only beginning
to develop the equivalent of phone books and the ones that exist
today are far from complete still later on in Chapter 6 well show
you how to use some of these directories
 Eventually youll start corresponding with people which means
youll want to know how to address mail to them Its vital to know
how to do this because the smallest mistake  using a comma when you
should have used a period for instance can bounce the message back
to you undelivered In this sense Net addresses are like phone
numbers one wrong digit and you get the wrong person Fortunately
most net addresses now adhere to a relatively easytounderstand
system
 Earlier you sent yourself a mail message using just your user
name This was sort of like making a local phone call  you didnt
have to dial a 1 or an area code This also works for mail to anybody
else who has an account on the same system as you
 Sending mail outside of your system though will require the use
of the Net equivalent of area codes called domains A basic Net
address will look something like this

 tomgworldstdcom

 Tomg is somebodys user ID and he is at hence the  sign a site
or in Internetese a domain known as stdcom Large organizations
often have more than one computer linked to the Internet in this case
the name of the particular machine is world you will quickly notice
that like boat owners Internet computer owners always name their
machines
 Domains tell you the name of the organization that runs a given
email site and what kind of site it is or if its not in the US
what country its located in Large organizations may have more than
one computer or gateway tied to the Internet so youll often see a
twopart domain name and sometimes even three or fourpart domain
names
 In general American addresses end in an organizational suffix
such as edu which means the site is at a college or university
Other American suffixes include

 com for businesses
 org for nonprofit organizations
 gov and mil for government and military agencies
 net for companies or organizations that run large networks

 Sites in the rest of the world tend to use a twoletter code that
represents their country Most make sense such as ca for Canadian
sites but there are a couple of seemingly odd ones Swiss sites end
in ch while South African ones end in za Some US sites have
followed this international convention such as wellsfcaus
 Youll notice that the above addresses are all in lowercase
Unlike almost everything else having anything at all to do with Unix
most Net mailing systems dont care about case so you generally dont
have to worry about capitalizing email addresses Alas there are a few
exceptions  some publicaccess sites do allow for capital letters in
user names When in doubt ask the person you want to write to or let
her send you a message first recall how a persons email address is
usually found on the top of her message The domain name the part of the
address after the  sign never has to be capitalized
 Its all a fairly simple system that works very well except
again its vital to get the address exactly right  just as you have
to dial a phone number exactly right Send a message to tomgunmedu
which is the University of New Mexico when you meant to send it to
tomgumnedu the University of Minnesota and your letter will either
bounce back to you undelivered or go to the wrong person
 If your message is bounced back to you as undeliverable youll
get an ominous lookingmessage from MAILERDAEMON actually a rather
benign Unix program that exists to handle mail with an evillooking
header followed by the text of your message Sometimes you can tell
what went wrong by looking at the first few lines of the bounced
message Besides an incorrect address its possible your host system
does not have the other site in the map it maintains of other host
systems Or you could be trying to send mail to another network such
as Bitnet or CompuServe that has special addressing requirements
 Sometimes figuring all this out can prove highly frustrating
But remember the prime Net commandment Ask Send a message to your
system administrator He or she might be able to help decipher the
problem
 There is one kind of address that may give your host system
particular problems There are two main ways that Unix systems
exchange mail One is known as UUCP and started out with a different
addressing system than the rest of the Net Most UUCP systems have
since switched over to the standard Net addressing system but a few
traditional sites still cling to their original type which tends to
have lots of exclamation points in it like this

 uunetsomesiteothersitemybuddy

 The problem for many host sites is that exclamation points also
known as bangs now mean something special in the more common systems
or shells used to operate many Unix computers This means that
addressing mail to such a site or even responding to a message you
received from one could confuse the poor computer to no end and your
message never gets sent out If that happens try putting backslashes in
front of each exclamation point so that you get an address that looks
like this

 uunetsomesiteothersitemybuddy

Note that this means you may not be able to respond to such a message
by typing a lowercase r  you may get an error message and youll
have to create a brandnew message
 If you want to get a taste of whats possible through email
start an email message to

 almanacoesorstedu

Leave the subject line blank As a message write this

 send quote

Or if youre feeling a little down write this instead

 send moralsupport

 In either case you will get back a message within a few seconds to
a few hours depending on the state of your host systems Internet
connection If you simply asked for a quote youll get back a
fortunecookielike saying If you asked for moral support youll also
get back a fortunecookielike saying only supposedly more uplifting
 This particular mail server is run by Oregon State University
Its main purpose is actually to provide a way to distribute agricultural
information via email If youd like to find out how to use the
servers full range of services send a message to its address with this
line in it

 send help

Youll quickly get back a lengthy document detailing just whats
available and how to get it
 Feeling opinionated Want to give the President of the United
States a piece of your mind Send a message to presidentwhitehousegov
Or if the vice president will do write vicepresidentwhitehousegov
 The mail program is actually a very powerful one and a Netwide
standard at least on Unix computers But it can be hard to figure
out  you can type a question mark to get a list of commands but
these may be of limited use unless youre already familiar with Unix
Fortunately there are a couple of other mail programs that are easier
to use


22 ELM  A BETTER WAY


 Elm is a combination mailbox and letterwriting system that uses
menus to help you navigate through mail Most Unixbased host systems
now have it online To use it type

 elm

and hit enter Youll get a menu of your waiting mail along with a
list of commands you can execute that will look something like this


 Mailbox is usrspoolmailadamg with 38 messages ELM 23 PL11

 You can use any of the following commands by pressing the first character
 delete or undelete mail mail a message reply or forward mail quit
 To read a message press return j  move down k  move up   help

 Each line shows the date you received the message who sent it
how many lines long the message is and the messages subject
 If you are using VT100 emulation you can move up and down the
menu with your up and down arrow keys Otherwise type the line number
of the message you want to read or delete and hit enter
 When you read a message it pauses every 24 lines instead of
scrolling until its done Hit the space bar to read the next page
You can type a lowercase r to reply or a lowercase q or i
to get back to the menu the I stands for index
 At the main menu hitting a lowercase m followed by enter
will let you start a message To delete a message type a lowercase
d You can do this while reading the message Or if you are in
the menu move the cursor to the messages line and then hit d
 When youre done with elm type a lowercase q The program
will ask if you really want to delete the messages you marked Then
it will ask you if you want to move any messages youve read but
havent marked for deletion to a received file For now hit your n
key
 Elm has a major disadvantage for the beginner The default text
editor it generally calls up when you hit your r or m key is often a
program called emacs Unixoids swear by emacs but everybody else almost
always finds it impossible Unfortunately you cant always get away
from it or vi another text editor often found on Unix systems so
later on well talk about some basic commands that will keep you from
going totally nuts
 If you want to save a message to your own computer hit s either
within the message or with your cursor on the message entry in the elm
menu A filename will pop up If you do not like it type a new name
you wont have to backspace Hit enter and the message will be saved
with that file name in your home directory on your host system After
you exit elm you can now download it ask your system administrator for
specifics on how to download  and upload  such files


23 PINE  AN EVEN BETTER WAY


 Pine is based on elm but includes a number of improvements that
make it an ideal mail system for beginners Like elm pine starts
you with a menu It also has an address book feature that is handy
for people with long or complex email addresses Hitting A at the
main menu puts you in the address book where you can type in the
persons first name or nickname followed by her address Then when
you want to send that person a message you only have to type in her
first name or nickname and pine automatically inserts her actual
address The address book also lets you set up a mailing list This
feature allows you to send the same message to a number of people at
once
 What really sets pine apart is its builtin text editor
which looks and feels a lot more like wordprocessing programs
available for MSDOS and Macintosh users Not only does it have
word wrap a revolutionary concept if ever there was one it also has a
spellchecker and a search command Best of all all of the commands
you need are listed in a twoline minimenu at the bottom of each
screen The commands look like this

 W Where is

The little caret is a synonym for the key marked control on your
keyboard To find where a particular word is in your document youd
hit your control key and your W key at the same time which would bring
up a prompt asking you for the word to look for
 Some of pines commands are a tad peculiar controlV for page
down for example which comes from being based on a variant of
emacs which is utterly peculiar But again all of the commands you
need are listed on that twoline minimenu so it shouldnt take you
more than a couple of seconds to find the right one
 To use pine type

 pine

at the command line and hit enter Its a relatively new program so
some systems may not yet have it online But its so easy to use you
should probably send email to your system administrator urging him to
get it


24 SMILEYS


 When youre involved in an online discussion you cant see the
smiles or shrugs that the other person might make in a live
conversation to show hes only kidding But online theres no body
language So what you might think is funny somebody else might take as
an insult To try to keep such misunderstandings from erupting into
bitter disputes we have smileys Tilt your head to the left and look at
the following sideways  Or simply  This is your basic smiley
Use it to indicate people should not take that comment you just made as
seriously as they might otherwise You make a smiley by typing a colon
a hyphen and a right parenthetical bracket Some people prefer using the
word grin usually in this form

 grin

Sometimes though youll see it as grin or even just g for short

Some other smileys include

  Wink
  Frown
 O Surprise
 8 Wearing glasses
  Abe Lincoln

 OK so maybe the last two are a little bogus 


25 SENDING EMAIL TO OTHER NETWORKS


 There are a number of computer networks that are not directly
part of the Net but which are now connected through gateways that
allow the passing of email Heres a list of some of the larger
networks how to send mail to them and how their users can send mail to
you

America Online

 Remove any spaces from a users name and append aolcom to get

 useraolcom

 America Online users who want to send mail to you need only put
your Net address in the to field before composing a message


ATTMail

 Address your message to userattmailcom

 From ATTMail a user would send mail to you in this form

 internetdomainuser

 So if your address were nancyrworldstdcom your correspondent
would send a message to you at

 internetworldstdcomnancyr


Bitnet

 Users of Bitnet and NetNorth in Canada and EARN in Europe often
have addresses in this form IZZYINDVMS If youre lucky all youll
have to do to mail to that address is add bitnet at the end to get
izzyindvmsbitnet Sometimes however mail to such an address will
bounce back to you because Bitnet addresses do not always translate
well into an Internet form If this happens you can send mail
through one of two InternetBitnet gateways First change the  in
the address to a  so that you get usernamesitebitnet Then add
either vmmaristedu or cunyvmcunyedu so that with the above
example you would get izzyindyvmsbitnetvmmaristedu or
izzyindvyvmsbitnetcunyvmcunyedu
 Bitnet users have it a little easier They can usually send mail
directly to your email address without fooling around with it at all
So send them your address and they should be OK


CompuServe

 CompuServe users have numerical addresses in this form
73727545 To send mail to a CompuServe user change the comma to a
period and add compuservecom for example
73727545compuservecom
 Note that some CompuServe users must pay extra to receive mail from
the Internet
 If you know CompuServe users who want to send you mail tell them
to GO MAIL and create a mail message In the address area instead of
typing in a CompuServe number have them type your address in this
form

 INTERNETYourIDYourAddress

 For example INTERNETadamgworldstdcom Note that both the
 and the  are required


Delphi

 To send mail to a Delphi user the form is usernamedelphicom


Fidonet

 To send mail to people using a Fidonet BBS you need the name
they use to log onto that system and its node number Fidonet node
numbers or addresses consist of three numbers in this form
1322190 The first number tells which of several broad geographic
zones the BBS is in 1 represents the US and Canada 2 Europe and
Israel 3 Pacific Asia 4 South America The second number
represents the BBSs network while the final number is the BBSs
FidoNode number in that network If your correspondent only gives
you two numbers for example 322190 it means the system is in zone
1
 Now comes the tricky part You have to reverse the numbers and
add to them the letters f n and z which stand for
FidoNodenetwork and zone For example the address above
would become

 f190n322z1

 Now add fidonetorg at the end to get
f190n322z1fidonetorg Then add FirstNameLastName to get

 FirstNameLastNamef190n322z1fidonetorg

Note the period between the first and last names Also some countries
now have their own Fidonet backbone systems which might affect
addressing For example were the above address in Germany you would
end it with fidode instead of fidonetorg
 Whew
 The reverse process is totally different First the person has
to have access to his or her BBSs net mail area and know the
Fidonet address of his or her local FidonetUUCP gateway often their
system operator will know it Your Fidonet correspondent should
address a netmail message to UUCP not your name in the to field
In the nodenumber field they should type in the node number of the
FidonetUUCP gateway if the gateway system is in the same regional
network as their system they need only type the last number for
example 390 instead of 322390 Then the first line of the message
has to be your Internet address followed by a blank line After
that the person can write the message and send it
 Because of the way Fidonet moves mail it could take a day or two
for a message to be delivered in either direction Also because many
Fidonet systems are run as hobbies it is considered good form to ask
the gateway sysops permission if you intend to pass large amounts of
mail back and forth Messages of a commercial nature are strictly
forbidden even if its something the other person asked for Also
consider it very likely that somebody other than the recipient will
read your messages


GEnie

 To send mail to a GEnie user add geniecom to the end
of the GEnie user name for example waltgeniecom

MCIMail

 To send mail to somebody with an MCIMail account add
mcimailcom to the end of their name or numerical address For
example

 5551212mcimailcom

 or

 jsmithmcimailcom

 Note that if there is more than one MCIMail subscriber with that
name you will get a mail message back from MCI giving you their names
and numerical addresses Youll then have to figure out which one you
want and resend the message

 From MCI a user would type

 Your Name EMS

at the To prompt At the EMS prompt he or she would type

 internet

followed by your Net address at the Mbx prompt


Peacenet

 To send mail to a Peacenet user use this form

 usernameigcorg

 Peacenet subscribers can use your regular address to send you
mail


Prodigy

 UserIDprodigycom Note that Prodigy users must pay extra for
Internet email


26 SEVEN UNIX COMMANDS YOU CANT LIVE WITHOUT


 If you connect to the Net through a Unix system eventually youll
have to come to terms with Unix For better or worse most Unix systems do
NOT shield you from their inner workings  if you want to copy a Usenet
posting to a file for example youll have to use some Unix commands if
you ever want to do anything with that file
 Like MSDOS Unix is an operating system  it tells the computer how
to do things Now while Unix may have a reputation as being even more
complex than MSDOS in most cases a few basic and simple commands
should be all youll ever need
 If your own computer uses MSDOS or PCDOS the basic concepts will
seem very familiar  but watch out for the cd command which works
differently enough from the similarly named DOS command that it will drive
you crazy Also unlike MSDOS Unix is case sensitive  if you type
commands or directory names in the wrong case youll get an error message
 If youre used to working on a Mac youll have to remember that Unix
stores files in directories rather than folders Unix directories are
organized like branches on a tree At the bottom is the root directory
with subdirectories branching off that and subdirectories in turn can
have subdirectories The Mac equivalent of a Unix subdirectory is a
folder within another folder

cat Equivalent to the MSDOS type command To pause a file
 every screen type

 cat file more

 where file is the name of the file you want to see
 Hitting controlC will stop the display Alternately
 you could type

 more file

 to achieve the same result You can also use cat for
 writing or uploading text files to your name or home
 directory similar to the MSDOS copy con command If
 you type

 cattest

 you start a file called test You can either write
 something simple no editing once youve finished a line and
 you have to hit return at the end of each line or upload
 something into that file using your communications softwares
 ASCII protocol To close the file hit controlD

cd The change directory command To change from your present
 directory to another type

 cd directory

 and hit enter Unlike MSDOS which uses a  to denote sub
 directories for example stufftext Unix uses a  for
 example stufftext So to change from your present
 directory to the stufftext subdirectory you would type

 cd stufftext

 and then hit enter As in MSDOS you do not need the first
 backslash if the subdirectory comes off the directory youre
 already in To move back up a directory tree you would type

 cd 

 followed by enter Note the space between the cd and the two
 periods  this is where MSDOS users will really go nuts

cp Copies a file The syntax is

 cp file1 file2

 which would copy file1 to file2 or overwrite file2 with
 file1

ls This command when followed by enter tells you whats in the
 directory similar to the DOS dir command except in
 alphabetical order

 ls  more

 will stop the listing every 24 lines  handy if there are a
 lot of things in the directory The basic ls command does not
 list hidden files such as the login file that controls
 how your system interacts with Unix To see these files type

 ls a or ls a  more

 ls l will tell you the size of each file in bytes and tell
 you when each was created or modified

mv Similar to the MSDOS rename command

 mv file1 file2

 will rename file1 as file2 The command can
 also be used to move files between directories

 mv file1 News

 would move file1 to your News directory

rm Deletes a file Type

 rm filename

 and hit enter but beware when you hit enter its gone for
 good

 WILDCARDS When searching for copying or deleting files you can
use wildcards if you are not sure of the files exact name

 ls man


would find the following files

 manual manualtxt manoman

Use a question mark when youre sure about all but one or two characters
For example

 ls man

would find a file called mane but not one called manual


27 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG


  You send a message but get back an ominous looking message from
MAILERDAEMON containing up to several dozen lines of computerese
followed by your message
 Somewhere in those lines you can often find a clue to what went
wrong You might have made a mistake in spelling the email address
The site to which youre sending mail might have been down for
maintenance or a problem You may have used the wrong translation for
mail to a nonInternet network
  You call up your host systems text editor to write a message or
reply to one and cant seem to get out
 If its emacs try controlX controlC in other words hit your
control key and your X key at the same time followed by control and C
If worse comes to worse you can hang up
  In elm you accidentally hit the D key for a message you want to
save
 Type the number of the message hit enter and then U which will
undelete the message This works only before you exit Elm once you
quit the message is gone
  You try to upload an ASCII message youve written on your own
computer into a message youre preparing in Elm or Pine and you get a
lot of left brackets capital Ms Ks and Ls and some funnylooking
characters
 Believe it or not your message will actually wind up looking fine
all that garbage is temporary and reflects the problems some Unix text
processors have with ASCII uploads But it will take much longer for
your upload to finish One way to deal with this is to call up the
simple mail program which will not produce any weird characters when you
upload a text file into a message Another way which is better if your
prepared message is a response to somebodys mail is to create a text
file on your host system with cat for example

 catfile

and then upload your text into that Then in elm or pine you can
insert the message with a simple command controlR in pine for
example only this time you wont see all that extraneous stuff
  You havent cleared out your Elm mailbox in awhile and you
accidentally hit y when you meant to hit n or viceversa when
exiting and now all your messages have disappeared Look in your News
directory at the command line type cd News for a file called
recieved Those are all your messages Unfortunately theres no way to
get them back into your Elm mailbox  youll have to download the file
or read it online






Chapter 3 USENET I




31 THE GLOBAL WATERING HOLE


 Imagine a conversation carried out over a period of hours and days
as if people were leaving messages and responses on a bulletin board Or
imagine the electronic equivalent of a radio talk show where everybody
can put their two cents in and no one is ever on hold
 Unlike email which is usually onetoone Usenet is manyto
many Usenet is the international meeting place where people gather to
meet their friends discuss the days events keep up with computer
trends or talk about whatevers on their mind Jumping into a Usenet
discussion can be a liberating experience Nobody knows what you look or
sound like how old you are what your background is Youre judged
solely on your words your ability to make a point
 To many people Usenet IS the Net In fact it is often confused
with Internet But it is a totally separate system All Internet sites
CAN carry Usenet but so do many nonInternet sites from sophisticated
Unix machines to old XT clones and Apple IIs
 Technically Usenet messages are shipped around the world from
host system to host system using one of several specific Net
protocols Your host system stores all of its Usenet messages in one
place which everybody with an account on the system can access That
way no matter how many people actually read a given message each
host system has to store only one copy of it Many host systems talk
with several others regularly in case one or another of their links goes
down for some reason When two host systems connect they basically
compare notes on which Usenet messages they already have Any that one
is missing the other then transmits and viceversa Because they are
computers they dont mind running through thousands even millions of
these comparisons every day
 Yes millions For Usenet is huge Every day Usenet users
pump upwards of 40 million characters a day into the system  roughly
the equivalent of volumes AG of the Encyclopedia Britannica Obviously
nobody could possibly keep up with this immense flow of messages Lets
look at how to find conferences and discussions of interest to you
 The basic building block of Usenet is the newsgroup which is a
collection of messages with a related theme on other networks these
would be called conferences forums bboards or specialinterest
groups There are now more than 5000 of these newsgroups in several
diferent languages covering everything from art to zoology from
science fiction to South Africa
 Some publicaccess systems typically the ones that work through
menus try to make it easier by dividing Usenet into several broad
categories Choose one of those and youre given a list of newsgroups in
that category Then select the newsgroup youre interested in and start
reading
 Other systems let you compile your own reading list so that you
only see messages in conferences you want In both cases conferences
are arranged in a particular hierarchy devised in the early 1980s
Newsgroup names start with one of a series of broad topic names For
example newsgroups beginning with comp are about particular computer
related topics These broad topics are followed by a series of more
focused topics so that compunix groups are limited to discussion
about Unix The main hierarchies are

 bionet Research biology
 bitlistserv Conferences originating as Bitnet mailing lists
 biz Business
 comp Computers and related subjects
 misc Discussions that dont fit anywhere else
 news News about Usenet itself
 rec Hobbies games and recreation
 sci Science other than research biology
 soc Social groups often ethnically related
 talk Politics and related topics
 alt Controversial or unusual topics not
 carried by all sites

 In addition many host systems carry newsgroups for a particular
city state or region For example nehousing is a newsgroup where
New Englanders look for apartments A growing number also carry K12
newsgroups which are aimed at elementary and secondary teachers and
students And a number of sites carry clari newsgroups which is
actually a commercial service consisting of wireservice stories and
a unique online computer news service more on this in chapter 10


32 NAVIGATING USENET WITH nn


 How do you dive right in As mentioned on some systems its all
done through menus  you just keep choosing from a list of choices until
you get to the newsgroup you want and then hit the read command On
Unix systems however you will have to use a newsreader program Two
of the more common ones are known as rn for read news and nn for no
news  because its supposed to be simpler to use
 For beginners nn may be the better choice because it works with
menus  you get a list of articles in a given newsgroup and then you
choose which ones you want to see To try it out connect to your host
system and at the command line type

 nn newsannouncenewusers

and hit enter After a few seconds you should see something like
this

 Obviously this is a good newsgroup to begin your exploration of
Usenet Heres what all this means The first letter on each line is
the letter you type to read that particular article it makes sense
that a newsgroup would have articles Next comes the name of the
person who wrote that article followed by its length in lines and
what the article is about At the bottom you see the local time at your
access site what youre doing right now ie SELECTing articles
which key to hit for some help the  key and how many of the articles
in the newsgroup you can see on this screen The moderated means the
newsgroup has a moderator who is the only one who can directly post
messages to it This is generally limited to groups such as this which
contain articles of basic information or for digests which are
basically online magazines more on them in a bit
 Say youre particularly interested in what Emily Postnews has to
say about proper etiquette on Usenet Hit your c key lower case and
the line will light up If you want to read something else hit the key
that corresponds to it And if you want to see whats on the next page
of articles hit return or your space bar
 But youre impatient to get going and you want to read that
article now The command for that in nn is a capital Z Hit it and
youll see something like this

 0957 announcenewusers LAST helpTop 4

 The first few lines are the messages header similar to the header
you get in email messages Then comes the beginning of the message
The last line tells you the time again the newsgroup name or part of
it anyway the position in your message stack that this message
occupies how to get help and how much of the message is on screen If
you want to keep reading this message just hit your space bar not your
enter key for the next screen and so on until done When done youll
be returned to the newsgroup menu For now hit Q upper case this time
which quits you out of nn and returns you to your host systems command
line
 To get a look at another interesting newsgroup type

 nn comprisks

and hit enter This newsgroup is another moderated group this time a
digest of all the funny and frightening ways computers and the people
who run and use them can go wrong Again you read articles by
selecting their letters If youre in the middle of an article and
decide you want to go onto the next one hit your n key
 Now its time to look for some newsgroups that might be of
particular interest to you Unix host systems that have nn use a program
called nngrep ever get the feeling Unix was not entirely written in
English that lets you scan newsgroups Exit nn and at your host
systems command line type

 nngrep word

where word is the subject youre interested in If you use a Macintosh
computer you might try

 nngrep mac

 Youll get something that looks like this

 altmusicmachinesoflovinggrace
 altreligionemacs
 compbinariesmac
 compemacs
 complangforthmac
 composmach
 compsourcesmac
 compsysmacannounce
 compsysmacapps
 compsysmaccomm
 compsysmacdatabases

 gnuemacsbug
 gnuemacsgnews
 gnuemacsgnus
 gnuemacshelp
 gnuemacslispmanual
 gnuemacssources
 gnuemacsvmbug
 gnuemacsvminfo
 gnuemacsvms

 Note that some of these obviously have something to do with
Macintoshes while some obviously do not nngrep is not a perfect system
If you want to get a list of ALL the newsgroups available on your host
system type

 nngrep a more

or
 nngrep a pg

and hit enter which one to use depends on the Unix used on your host
system if one doesnt do anything try the other You dont
absolutely need the more or pg but if you dont include it the list
will keep scrolling rather than pausing every 24 lines If you are in
nn hitting a capital Y will bring up a similar list
 Typing nn newsgroup for every newsgroup can get awfully tiring
after awhile When you use nn your host system looks in a file called
newsrc This is basically a list of every newsgroup on the host system
along with notations on which groups and articles you have read all
maintained by the computer You can also use this file to create a
reading list that brings up each newsgroup to which you want to
subscribe To try it out type

 nn

without any newsgroup name and hit enter
 Unfortunately you will start out with a newsrc file that has you
subscribed to every single newsgroup on your host system To delete
a newsgroup from your reading list type a capital U while its menu is
on the screen The computer will ask you if youre sure you want to
unsubscribe If you then hit a Y youll be unsubscribed and put in
the next group
 With many host systems carrying thousands of newsgroups this will
take you forever
 Fortunately there are a couple of easier ways to do this Both
involve calling up your newsrc file in a word or text processor In a
newsrc file each newsgroup takes up one line consisting of the
groups name an exclamation point or a colon and a range of numbers
Newsgroups with a colon are ones to which you are subscribed those
followed by an exclamation point are unsubscribed To start with a
clean slate then you have to change all those colons to exclamation
points
 If you know how to use emacs or vi call up the newsrc file you
might want to make a copy of newsrc first just in case and use the
searchandreplace function to make the change
 If youre not comfortable with these text processor you can
download the newsrc file make the changes on your own computer and
then upload the revised file Before you download the file however
you should do a couple of things One is to type

 cp newsrc temprc

and hit enter You will actually download this temprc file note the
name does not start with a period  some computers such as those using
MSDOS do not allow file names starting with periods After you
download the file open it in your favorite word processor and use its
searchandreplace function to change the exclamation points to colons
Be careful not to change anything else Save the document in ASCII or
text format Dial back into your host system At the command line
type

 cp temprc temprc1

and hit enter This new file will serve as your backup newsrc file
just in case something goes wrong Upload the temprc file from your
computer This will overwrite the Unix systems old temprc file Now
type

 cp temprc newsrc

and hit enter You now have a clean slate to start creating a reading
list


33 nn COMMANDS


To mark a specific article for reading type the letter next to it in lower
case To mark a specific article and all of its responses type the letter
and an asterisk for example

 a

 Hitting a capital C sends out a new message that tells host
 systems that receive it to find earlier message and delete
 it

F To post a public response or followup If selected while
 still on a newsgroup page asks you which article to
 follow up If selected while in a specific article will
 follow up that article In either case youll be asked if
 you want to include the original article in yours Caution
 puts you in whatever text editor is your default

N Goes to the next subscribed newsgroup with unread articles

 The first thing to understand about Usenet is that it is widely
 misunderstood Every day on Usenet the blind men and the elephant
 phenomenon is evident in spades In my opinion more flame wars
 arise because of a lack of understanding of the nature of Usenet than
 from any other source And consider that such flame wars arise of
 necessity among people who are on Usenet Imagine then how poorly
 understood Usenet must be by those outside

 MORE7

 This time the header looks much more like the gobbledygook you get
in email messages To keep reading hit your space bar If you hit
your n key lower case youll go to the next message in the
numerical order
 To escape rn just keep hitting your q key in lower case until
you get back to the command line Now lets set up your reading list
Because rn uses the same newsrc file as nn you can use one of the
searchandreplace methods described above Or you can do this Type

 rn

and hit enter When the first newsgroup comes up on your screen hit
your u key in lower case Hit it again and again and again Or
just keep it pressed down if your computer starts beeping let up for a
couple of seconds Eventually youll be told youre at the end of the
newsgroups and asked what you want to do next
 Heres where you begin entering newsgroups Type

 g newsgroup

for example g compsysmacannounce and hit enter Youll be asked
if you want to subscribe Hit your y key Then type

 g next newsgroup

for example g compannouncenewusers and hit enter Repeat until
done This process will also set up your reading list for nn if you
prefer that newsreader But how do you know which newsgroups to
subscribe Typing a lowercase l and then hitting enter will show you a
list of all available newsgroups Again since there could be more than
2000 newsgroups on your system this might not be something you want to
do Fortunately you can search for groups with particular words in
their names using the l command Typing

 l mac

followed by enter will bring up a list of newsgroups with those letters
in them and as in nn you will also see groups dealing with emacs and
the like in addition to groups related to Macintosh computers
 Because of the vast amount of messages transmitted over Usenet
most systems carry messages for only a few days or weeks So if theres
a message you want to keep you should either turn on your computers
screen capture or save it to a file which you can later download To
save a message as a file in rn type

 s filename

where filename is what you want to call the file Hit enter Youll be
asked if you want to save it in mailbox format In most cases you
can answer with an n which will strip off the header The message
will now be saved to a file in your News directory which you can access
by typing cd News and then hitting enter
 Also some newsgroups fill up particularly quickly  go away for a
couple of days and youll come back to find hundreds of articles One
way to deal with that is to mark them as read so that they no longer
appear on your screen In nn hit a capital J in rn a small c


35 rn COMMANDS


 Different commands are available to you in rn depending on whether you
are already in a newsgroup or reading a specific article At any point
typing a lowercase h will bring up a list of available commands and some
terse instructions for using them Here are some of them

After youve just called up rn or within a newsgroup

c Marks every article in a newsgroup as read or caught up
 so that you dont have to see them again The system will ask
 you if you are sure Can be done either when asked if you
 want to read a particular newsgroup or once in the newsgroup

g Goes to a newsgroup in this form

 g newsgroup

 Use this both for going to groups to which youre already
 subscribed and subscribing to new groups

h Provides a list of available commands with terse
 instructions

l Gives a list of all available newsgroups

p Goes to the first previous subscribed newsgroup with unread
 articles

q Quits or exits rn if you have not yet gone into a newsgroup
 If you are in a newsgroup it quits that one and brings you to
 the next subscribed newsgroup

Only within a newsgroup

 Gives a list of all available articles in the newsgroup


m Marks a specific article or series of articles as unread
 again so that you can come back to them later Typing

 1700m

 and hitting enter would mark just that article as unread
 Typing

 17001800m

 and hitting enter would mark all of those articles as un
 read

space Brings up the next page of article listings If already on
 the last page displays the first article in the newsgroup

u Unsubscribe from the newsgroup

text Searches through the newsgroup for articles with a specific
 word or phrase in the subject line from the current
 article to the end of the newsgroup For example

 EFF

 would bring you to the first article with EFF in the
 subject line

text The same as text except it searches in reverse order from
 the current article

Only within a specific article

e Some newsgroups consist of articles that are binary files
 typically programs or graphics images Hitting e will convert
 the ASCII characters within such an article into a file you
 can then download and use or view assuming you have the proper
 computer and software Many times such files will be split
 into several articles just keep calling up the articles and
 hitting e until done Youll find the resulting file in your
 News subdirectory

C If you post an article and then decide it was a mistake call
 it up on your host system and hit this The message will soon
 begin disappearing on systems around the world

F Post a public response in the newsgroup to the current
 article Includes a copy of her posting which you can then
 edit down using your host systems text editor

f The same as above except it does not include a copy of the
 original message in yours

m Marks the current article as unread so that you can come
 back to it later You do not have to type the article
 number

ControlN Brings up the first response to the article If there is no
 followup article this returns you to the first unread article
 in the newsgroup

ControlP Goes to the message to which the current article is a reply

n Goes to the next unread article in the newsgroup

N Takes you to the next article in the newsgroup even if youve
 already read it

q Quits or exits the current article Leaves you in the current
 newsgroup

R Reply via email only to the author of the current article
 Includes a copy of his message in yours

r The same as above except it does not include a copy of his
 article

s file Copies the current article to a file in your News directory
 where file is the name of the file you want to save it to
 Youll be asked if you want to use mailbox format when
 saving If you answer by hitting your N key most of the
 header will not be saved

smail user Mails a copy of the article to somebody For user substitute
 an email address Does not let you add comments to the
 message first however

space Hitting the space bar shows the next page of the article or if
 at the end goes to the next unread article


36 ESSENTIAL NEWSGROUPS


 With so much to choose from everybody will likely have their own
unique Usenet reading list But there are a few newsgroups that are
particularly of interest to newcomers Among them

 newsannouncenewusers This group consists of a series of
 articles that explain various facets of
 Usenet

 newsnewusersquestions This is where you can ask questions
 well see how in a bit about how
 Usenet works

 newsannouncenewsgroups Look here for information about new or
 proposed newsgroups

 newsanswers Contains lists of Frequently Asked
 Questions FAQs and their answers from
 many different newsgroups Learn how to
 fight jet lag in the FAQ from

 the Internet will post details here


37 SPEAKING UP


 Threads are an integral part of Usenet When somebody posts a
message often somebody else will respond Soon a thread of
conversation begins Following these threads is relatively easy In
nn related messages are grouped together In rn when youre done
with a message you can hit controlN to read the next related
message or followup As you explore Usenet its probably a good
idea to read discussions for awhile before you jump in This way you
can get a feel for the particular newsgroup  each has its
own rhythms
 Eventually though youll want to speak up There are two main
ways to do this You join an existing conversation or you can start
a whole new thread
 If you want to join a discussion you have to decide if you want
to include portions of the message you are responding to in your
message The reason to do this is so people can see what youre
responding to just in case the original message has disappeared from
their system remember that most Usenet messages have a short life span
on the average host system or they cant find it
 If youre using a Unix host system joining an existing
conversation is similar in both nn and rn hit your F key when done
with a given article in the thread In rn type a small f if you
dont want to include portions of the message youre responding to an
uppercase F if you do In nn type a capital F Youll then be asked
if you want to include portions of the original message
 And heres where you hit another Unix wall When you hit your F
key your host system calls up its basic Unix text editor If youre
lucky thatll be pico a very easy system More likely however
youll get dumped into emacs or possibly vi which youve already met
in the chapter on email
 The single most important emacs command is

 controlx controlc

 This means depress your control key and hit x Then depress the
control key and hit c Memorize this In fact its so important it
bears repeating

 controlx controlc

 These keystrokes are how you get out of emacs If they work well
youll be asked if you want to send edit abort or list the message you
were working on If they dont work well say you accidentally hit some
other weird key combination that means something special to emacs and
nothing seems to happen or you just get more weirdlooking emacs
prompts on the bottom of your screen try hitting controlg This should
stop whatever emacs was trying to do you should see the word quit on
the bottom of your screen after which you can hit controlx controlc
But if this still doesnt work remember that you can always disconnect
and dial back in
 If you have told your newsreader you do want to include portions
of the original message in yours it will automatically put the entire
thing at the top of your message Use the arrow keys to move down to
the lines you want to delete and hit controlK which will delete one
line at a time
 You can then write your message Remember that you have to hit
enter before your cursor gets to the end of the line because emacs
does not have word wrapping
 When done hit controlX controlC Youll be asked the
question about sending editing aborting etc Choose one If you
hit Y your host system will start the process to sending your
message across the Net
 The nn and rn programs work differently when it comes to posting
entirely new messages In nn type

 post

and hit enter in any newsgroup Youll be asked which newsgroup to
post a message to Type in its name and hit enter Then youll be
asked for keywords These are words youd use to attract somebody
scanning a newsgroup Say youre selling your car You might type
the type of car here Next comes a summary line which is somewhat
similar Finally youll be asked for the messages distribution
This is where you put how widely you want your message disseminated
Think about this one for a second If you are selling your car it
makes little sense to send a message about it all over the world But
if you want to talk about the environment it might make a lot of
sense Each host system has its own set of distribution
classifications but theres generally a local one just for users of
that system one for the city state or region its in another for
the country for example usa one for the continent for Americans
and Canadians na and finally one for the entire world usually
world
 Which one to use Generally a couple of seconds thought will
help you decide If youre selling your car use your city or regional
distribution  people in Australia wont much care and may even get
annoyed If you want to discuss presidential politics using a USA
distribution makes more sense If you want to talk about events in the
Middle East sending your message to the entire world is perfectly
acceptable
 Then you can type your message If youve composed your message
offline generally a good idea if you and emacs dont get along you
can upload it now You may see a lot of weird looking characters as
it uploads into emacs but those will disappear when you hit controlX
and then controlC Alternately save the message for example by
hitting m in rn log out compose your message offline log back on and
upload your message into a file on your host system Then call up
Usenet find the article you saved Start a reply and youll be asked
if you want to include a prepared message Type in the name of the file
you just created and hit enter
 In rn you have to wait until you get to the end of a newsgroup
to hit F which will bring up a messagecomposing system
Alternately at your host systems command line you can type

 Pnews

and hit enter Youll be prompted somewhat similarly to the nn
system except that youll be given a list of possible distributions
If you chose world youll get this message


This program posts news to thousands of machines throughout the entire
civilized world Your message will cost the net hundreds if not thousands of
dollars to send everywhere Please be sure you know what you are doing

Are you absolutely sure that you want to do this ny

 Dont worry  your message wont really cost the Net untold
amounts although again its a good idea to think for a second
whether your message really should go everywhere
 If you want to respond to a given post through email instead of
publicly hit R in nn or r or R in rn In rn as with followup
articles the uppercase key includes the original message in yours
 Most newsgroups are unmoderated which means that every message
you post will eventually wind up on every host system within the
geographic region you specified that carries that newsgroup
 Some newsgroups however are moderated as you saw earlier with
comprisks In these groups messages are shipped to a single
location where a moderator acting much like a magazine editor
decides what actually gets posted In some cases groups are
moderated like scholarly journals In other cases its to try to cut
down on the massive number of messages that might otherwise be posted
 Youll notice that many articles in Usenet end with a fancy
signature that often contains some witty saying a clever drawing
and almost incidentally the posters name and email address You
too can have your own signature automatically appended to everything
you post On your own computer create a signature file Try to keep
it to four lines or less lest you annoy others on the Net Then
while connected to your host system type

 catsignature

and hit enter note the period before the s Upload your signature
file into this using your communications softwares ASCII upload
protocol When done hit controlD the Unix command for closing a
file Now every time you post a message this will be appended to it
 There are a few caveats to posting Usenet is no different from
a Town Meeting or publication youre not supposed to break the law
whether thats posting copyrighted material or engaging in illegal
activities It is also not a place to try to sell products except in
certain biz and forsale newsgroups


38 CROSSPOSTING


 Sometimes youll have an issue you think should be discussed in
more than one Usenet newsgroup Rather than posting individual messages
in each group you can post the same message in several groups at once
through a process known as crossposting
 Say you want to start a discussion about the political
ramifications of importing rare tropical fish from Brazil People who
read recaquaria might have something to say So might people who read
altpoliticsanimals and talkpoliticsmisc
 Crossposting is easy It also should mean that people on other
systems who subscribe to several newsgroups will see your message only
once rather than several times  newsreading software can cancel out
the other copies once a person has read the message When you get ready
to post a message whether through Pnews for rn or the post command in
nn youll be asked in which newsgroups Type the names of the various
groups separated by a comma but no space for example

 recaquariaaltpoliticsanimalstalkpoliticsmisc

and hit enter After answering the other questions geographic
distribution etc the message will be posted in the various
groups unless one of the groups is moderated in which case the
message goes to the moderator who decides whether to make it public
 Its considered bad form to post to an excessive number of
newsgroups or inappropriate newsgroups Probably you dont really have
to post something in 20 different places And while you may think your
particular political issue is vitally important to the fate of the world
chances are the readers of recartscomics will not or at least not
important enough to impose on them Youll get a lot of nasty email
messages demanding you restrict your messages to the appropriate
newsgroups





Chapter 4 USENET II


41 FLAME BLATHER AND SPEW


 Something about online communications seems to make some people
particularly irritable Perhaps its the immediacy and semianonymity
of it all Whatever it is there are whole classes of people you will
soon think seem to exist to make you miserable
 Rather than pausing and reflecting on a message as one might do
with a letter received on paper its just so easy to hit your R key
and tell somebody you dont really know what you really think of them
Even otherwise calm people sometimes find themselves turning into
raving lunatics When this happens flames erupt
 A flame is a particularly nasty personal attack on somebody for
something he or she has written Periodically an exchange of flames
erupts into a flame war that begin to take up all the space in a given
newsgroup and sometimes several flamers like crossposting to let the
world know how they feel These can go on for weeks sometimes they go
on for years in which case they become holy wars usually on such
topics as the relative merits of Macintoshes and IBMs Often just when
theyre dying down somebody new to the flame war reads all the messages
gets upset and issues an urgent plea that the flame war be taken to e
mail so everybody else can get back to whatever the newsgroups business
is All this usually does though is start a brand new flame war in
which this poor person comes under attack for daring to question the
First Amendment prompting others to jump on the attackers for impugning
this poor soul You get the idea
 Every so often a discussion gets so out of hand that somebody
predicts that either the government will catch on and shut the whole
thing down or somebody will sue to close down the network or maybe
even the wrath of God will smote everybody involved This brings what
has become an inevitable rejoinder from others who realize that the
network is in fact a resilient creature that will not die easily
Imminent death of Usenet predicted Film at 11
 Flame wars can be tremendously fun to watch at first They
quickly grow boring though And wait until the first time youre
attacked
 Flamers are not the only netcharacters to watch out for
 Spewers assume that whatever they are particularly concerned about
either really is of universal interest or should be rammed down the
throats of people who dont seem to care  as frequently as possible
You can usually tell a spewers work by the number of articles he posts
in a day on the same subject and the number of newsgroups to which he
then sends these articles  both can reach well into double digits
Often these messages relate to various ethnic conflicts around the
world Frequently there is no conceivable connection between the issue
at hand and most of the newsgroups to which he posts No matter If you
try to point this out in a response to one of these messages you will be
inundated with angry messages that either accuse you of being an
insensitive racistAmericanwhatever or ignore your point entirely to
bring up several hundred more lines of commentary on the perfidy of
whoever it is the spewer thinks is out to destroy his people
 Closely related to these folks are the Holocaust revisionists who
periodically inundate certain groups such as sochistory with long
rants about how the Holocaust never really happened Some people
attempt to refute these people with facts but others realize this only
encourages them
 Blatherers tend to be more benign Their problem is that they
just cant get to the point  they can wring three or four screenfuls
out of a thought that others might sum up in a sentence or two A
related condition is excessive quoting People afflicted with this will
include an entire message in their reply rather than excising the
portions not relevant to whatever point theyre trying to make The
worst quote a long message and then add a single line

 I agree

or some such often followed by a monster signature see section 45
 There are a number of other Usenet denizens youll soon come to
recognize Among them
 Netweenies These are the kind of people who enjoy Insulting
others the kind of people who post nasty messages in a sewing
newsgroup just for the hell of it
 Netgeeks People to whom the Net is Life who worry about what
happens when they graduate and they lose their free 24hour access
 Netgods The oldtimers the true titans of the Net and the
keepers of its collective history They were around when the Net
consisted of a couple of computers tied together with baling wire
 Lurkers Actually you cant tell these people are there but
they are Theyre the folks who read a newsgroup but never post or
respond
 Wizards People who know a particular Netrelated topic inside
and out Unix wizards can perform amazing tricks with that operating
system for example
 Netsaints Always willing to help a newcomer eager to share
their knowledge with those not born with an innate ability to navigate
the Net they are not as rare as you might think Post a question
about something and youll often be surprised how many responses you
get
 The last group brings us back to the Nets oral tradition With
few written guides people have traditionally learned their way around
the Net by asking somebody whether at the terminal next to them or on
the Net itself That tradition continues if you have a question ask
 Today one of the places you can look for help is in the
newsnewusersquestions newsgroup which as its name suggests is a
place to learn more about Usenet But be careful what you post Some
of the Usenet wizards there get cranky sometimes when they have to
answer the same question over and over again Oh theyll eventually
answer your question but not before they tell you should have
asked your host system administrator first or looked at the postings in
newsannouncenewusers


42 KILLFILES THE CURE FOR WHAT AILS YOU


 As you keep reading Usenet you are going to run across things or
people that really drive you nuts  or that you just get tired of
seeing
 Killfiles are just the thing for you When you start your
newsreader it checks to see if you have any lists of words phrases
or names you dont want to see If you do then it blanks out any
messages containing those words
 Such as cascades
 As you saw earlier when you post a reply to a message and
include parts of that message the original lines show up with a  in
front of them Well what if you reply to a reply Then you get a 
in front of the line And if you reply to that reply You get 
Keep this up and soon you get a triangle of s building up in your
message
 There are people who like building up these triangles or
cascades Theyll respond to your message by deleting everything
youve said leaving only the In message 123435 you said part and
the last line of your message to which they add a nonsensical
retort On and on they go until the triangle has reached the right
end of the page Then they try to expand the triangle by deleting one
 with each new line Whoever gets to finish this megatriangle wins
 There is even a newsgroup just for such folks altcascade
Unfortunately cascaders would generally rather cascade in other
newsgroups Because it takes a lot of messages to build up a completed
cascade the targeted newsgroup soon fills up with these messages Of
course if you complain youll be bombarded with messages about the
First Amendment and artistic expression  or worse with another
cascade The only thing you can do is ignore them by setting up a
killfile
 There are also certain newsgroups where killfiles will come in
handy because of the way the newsgroups are organized For example
readers of recartstvsoaps always use an acronym in their subject line
for the show theyre writing about AMC for example for All My
Children This way people who only want to read about One Life to
Live can blank out all the messages about The Young and the Restless
and all the others to keep people from accidentally screening out
messages that might contain the letters gh in them General Hospital
viewers always use gh in their subject lines
 Both nn and rn let you create killfiles but in different ways
 To create a killfile in nn go into the newsgroup with the
offending messages and type a capital K Youll see this at the
bottom of your screen

 AUTO kill or select CR  Kill subject 30 days

If you hit return nn will ask you which articles subject youre
tired of Choose one and the article and any followups will disappear
and you wont see them again for 30 days
 If you type a lowercase k instead youll get this

 AUTO KILL on subject or name s

If you hit your S key or just enter youll see this

 KILL Subject 

Type in the name of the offending word or phrase and hit enter
Youll then be prompted

 KILL in group efftest or in all groups g

except that the name of the group you see will be the one youre
actually in at the moment Because cascaders and other annoying
people often crosspost their messages to a wide range of newsgroups
you might consider hitting a instead of g Next comes

 Lifetime of entry in days permanent 30

The P key will screen out the offending articles forever while
hitting enter will do it for 30 days You can also type in a number
of days for the blocking
 Creating killfiles in rn works differently  its default
killfile generator only works for messages in specific groups rather
than globally for your entire newsgroup list To create a global
killfile youll have to write one yourself
 To create a killfile in rn go into the newsgroup where the
offending messages are and type in its number so you get it on your
screen Type a capital K From now on any message with that subject
line will disappear before you read the group You should probably
choose a reply rather than the original message so that you will get
all of the followups the original message wont have a Re  in its
subject line The next time you call up that newsgroup rn will tell
you its killing messages When its done hit the space bar to go
back into reading mode
 To create a global kill file that will automatically wipe out
articles in all groups you read start rn and type controlK This
will start your whatever text editor you have as your default on your
host system and create a file called KILL in your News
subdirectory
 On the first line youll type in the word phrase or name you
dont want to see followed by commands that tell rn whether to search
an entire message for the word or name and then what to do when it
finds it
 Each line must be in this form

 patternmodifierj

 Pattern is the word or phrase you want rn to look for Its
caseinsensitive both test and Test will be knocked out The
modifier tells rn whether to limit its search to message headers
which can be useful when the object is to never see messages from a
particular person

 a Looks through an entire message
 h Looks just at the header

 You can leave out the modifier command in which case rn will
look only at the subject line of messages The j at the end tells rn to
screen out all articles with the offending word
 So if you never want to see the word foo in any header ever again
type this

 foohj

 This is particularly useful for getting rid of articles from
people who post in more than one newsgroup such as cascaders since
an articles newsgroup name is always in the header
 If you just want to block messages with a subject line about
cascades you could try

 fooj

 To kill anything that is a followup to any article use this
pattern

 Subject Rej

When done writing lines for each phrase to screen exit the text
editor as you normally would and youll be put back in rn
 One word of caution go easy on the global killfile An
extensive global killfile or one that makes frequent use of the a
modifier can dramatically slow down rn since the system will now have
to look at every single word in every single message in all the
newsgroups you want to read
 If theres a particular person whose posts you never want to see
again first find his or her address which will be in the from line
of his postings and then write a line in your killfile like this

 From nameaddressallhj


43 SOME USENET HINTS


 Case counts in Unix  most of the time Many Unix commands
including many of those used for reading Usenet articles are case
sensitive Hit a d when you meant a D and either nothing will happen
or something completely different from what you expected will happen
So watch that case
 In nn you can get help most of the time by typing a question mark
the exception is when you are writing your own message because then
you are inside the textprocessing program In rn type a lowercase h
at any prompt to get some online help
 When youre searching for a particular newsgroup whether through
the l command in rn or with nngrep for nn you sometimes may have to
try several keywords For example there is a newsgroup dedicated to
the Grateful Dead but youd never find it if you tried say l grateful
dead because the name is recmusicgdead In general try the smallest
possible part of the word or discussion youre looking for for example
use trek to find newsgroups about Star Trek If one word doesnt
produce anything try another


44 THE BRAINTUMOR BOY THE MODEM TAX AND THE CHAIN LETTER


 Like the rest of the world Usenet has its share of urban legends
and questionable activities There are three in particular that plague
the network Spend more than oh 15 minutes within Usenet and youre
sure to run into the Brain Tumor Boy the plot by the evil FCC to tax
your modem and Dave Rhodes miracle cure for poverty For the record
heres the story on all of them
 There once was a sevenyearold boy in England named Craig
Shergold who was diagnosed with a seemingly incurable brain tumor As
he lay dying he wished only to have friends send him postcards The
local newspapers got a hold of the tearjerking story Soon the boys
wish had changed he now wanted to get into the Guinness Book of World
Records for the largest postcard collection Word spread around the
world People by the millions sent him postcards
 Miraculously the boy lived An American billionaire even flew
him to the US for surgery to remove what remained of the tumor And
his wish succeeded beyond his wildest dreams  he made the Guinness
Book of World Records
 But with Craig now well into his teens his dream has turned into
a nightmare for the post office in the small town outside London where
he lives Like Craig himself his request for cards just refuses to
die inundating the post office with millions of cards every year
Just when it seems like the flow is slowing along comes somebody else
who starts up a whole new slew of requests for people to send Craig
post cards or greeting cards or business cards  Craig letters have
truly taken on a life of their own and begun to mutate Even Dear Abby
has been powerless to make it stop
 What does any of this have to do with the Net The Craig letter
seems to pop up on Usenet as often as it does on cork boards at major
corporations No matter how many times somebody like Gene Spafford
posts periodic messages to ignore them or spend your money on something
more sensible a donation to the local Red Cross say somebody
manages to post a letter asking readers to send cards to poor little
Craig
 Dont send any cards to the Federal Communications Commission
either
 In 1987 the FCC considered removing a tax break it had granted
CompuServe and other large commercial computer networks for use of the
national phone system The FCC quickly reconsidered after alarmed users
of bulletinboard systems bombarded it with complaints about this modem
tax
 Now every couple of months somebody posts an urgent message
warning Net users that the FCC is about to impose a modem tax This is
NOT true The way you can tell if youre dealing with the hoax story
is simple it ALWAYS mentions an incident in which a talkshow host on
KGO radio in San Francisco becomes outraged on the air when he reads a
story about the tax in the New York Times
 Another way to tell its not true is that it never mentions a
specific FCC docket number or closing date for comments
 Save that letter to your congressman for something else
 Sooner or later youre going to run into a message titled Make
Money Fast Its your basic chain letter The Usenet version is always
about some guy named Dave Rhodes who was on the verge of death or
something when he discovered a perfectly legal way to make tons of money
 by posting a chain letter on computer systems around the world Yeah
right


45 BIG SIG


 There are sigs and there are sigs Many people put only barebones
information in their sig files  their names and email addresses
perhaps their phone numbers Others add a quotation they think is funny or
profound and a disclaimer that their views are not those of their employer
 Still others add some ASCIIart graphics And then there are
those who go totally berserk posting huge creations with multiple quotes
hideous ASCII barfics and more email addresses than anybody could
humanly need College freshmen unleashed on the Net seem to excel at
these You can see the best of the worst in the altfanwarlord
newsgroup which exists solely to critique sigs that go too far such as

 Annoying people with huge netsignatures for over 20 years 
 

 The difference between a netidiot and a bucket of shit is that at 
 least a bucket can be emptied Let me further illustrate my point 
 by comparing these charts here pulls out charts Here we have a 
 user who not only flames people who dont agree with his narrow 
 minded drivel but he has this huge signature that takes up many 
 pages with useless quotes This also makes reading his frequented 
 newsgroups a torture akin to having at 300 baud modem on a VAX I 
 might also add that his contribution to society rivals only toxic 
 dump sites

46 THE FIRST AMENDMENT AS LOCAL ORDINANCE


 Usenets international reach raises interesting legal questions that
have yet to be fully resolved Can a discussion or posting that is legal
in one country be transmitted to a country where it is against the law
Does the posting even become illegal when it reaches the border And
what if that country is the only path to a third country where the
message is legal as well Several foreign colleges and other
institutions have cut off feeds of certain newsgroups where Americans
post what is in the US perfectly legal discussions of drugs or
alternative sexual practices Even in the US some universities have
discontinued certain newsgroups their administrators find offensive
again usually in the alt hierarchy
 An interesting example of this sort of question happened in 1993
when a Canadian court issued a gag order on Canadian reporters covering a
particularly controversial murder case Americans not bound by the gag
order began posting accounts of the trial  which any Canadian with a
Net account could promptly read


47 USENET HISTORY


 In the late 1970s Unix developers came up with a new feature a
system to allow Unix computers to exchange data over phone lines
 In 1979 two graduate students at Duke University in North
Carolina Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis came up with the idea of using
this system known as UUCP for UnixtoUnix CoPy to distribute
information of interest to people in the Unix community Along with
Steve Bellovin a graduate student at the University of North Carolina
and Steve Daniel they wrote conferencing software and linked together
computers at Duke and UNC
 Word quickly spread and by 1981 a graduate student at Berkeley
Mark Horton and a nearby high school student Matt Glickman had
released a new version that added more features and was able to handle
larger volumes of postings  the original North Carolina program was
meant for only a few articles in a newsgroup each day
 Today Usenet connects tens of thousands of sites around the world
from mainframes to Amigas With more than 3000 newsgroups and untold
thousands of readers it is perhaps the worlds largest computer
network


48 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG


  When you start up rn you get a warning that bogus
newsgroups are present
 Within a couple of minutes youll be asked whether to keep these or
delete them Delete them Bogus newsgroups are newsgroups that your
system administrator or somebody else has determined are no longer
needed
  While in a newsgroup in rn you get a message skipping
unavailable article
 This is usually an article that somebody posted and then decided to
cancel
  You upload a text file to your Unix host system for use in a
Usenet message or email and when you or your recipient reads the file
every line ends with a M
 This happens because Unix handles line endings differently than MS
DOS or Macintosh computers Most Unix systems have programs to convert
incoming files from other computers To use it upload your file and
then at your command line type

 dos2unix filename filename or

 mac2unix filename filename

depending on which kind of computer you are using and where filename is
the name of the file youve just uploaded A similar program can prepare
text files for downloading to your computer for example

 unix2dos filename filename or
 unix2mac filename filename

will ensure that a text file you are about to get will not come out
looking odd on your computer

Chapter 5 MAILING LISTS AND BITNET



51 INTERNET MAILING LISTS


 Usenet is not the only forum on the Net Scores of mailing
lists represent another way to interact with other Net users
Unlike Usenet messages which are stored in one central location on
your host systems computer mailinglist messages are delivered right
to your email box unlike Usenet messages
 You have to ask for permission to join a mailing list Unlike
Usenet where your message is distributed to the world on a mailing
list you send your messages to a central moderator who either remails
it to the other people on the list or uses it to compile a periodic
digest mailed to subscribers
 Given the number of newsgroups why would anybody bother with a
mailing list
 Even on Usenet there are some topics that just might not generate
enough interest for a newsgroup for example the Queen list which is
all about the late Freddie Mercurys band
 And because a moderator decides who can participate a mailing list
can offer a degree of freedom to speak ones mind or not worry about
netweenies that is not necessarily possible on Usenet Several
groups offer anonymous postings  only the moderator knows the real
names of people who contribute Examples include 12Step where people
enrolled in such programs as Alcoholics Anonymous can discuss their
experiences and sappho a list limited to gay and bisexual women
 You can find mailing addresses and descriptions of these lists
in the newsannouncenewusers newsgroup with the subject of Publicly
Accessible Mailing Lists Mailing lists now number in the hundreds
so this posting is divided into three parts
 If you find a list to which you want to subscribe send an e
mail message to

 listrequestaddress

where list is the name of the mailing list and address is the
moderators email address asking to be added to the list Include
your full email address just in case something happens to your
messages header along the way and ask if youre accepted for the
address to mail messages to the list


52 BITNET


 As if Usenet and mailing lists were not enough there are Bitnet
discussion groups or lists
 Bitnet is an international network linking colleges and
universities but it uses a different set of technical protocols for
distributing information from the Internet or Usenet It offers hundreds
of discussion groups comparable in scope to Usenet newsgroups
 One of the major differences is the way messages are
distributed Bitnet messages are sent to your mailbox just as with a
mailing list However where mailing lists are often maintained by a
person all Bitnet discussion groups are automated  you subscribe to
them through messages to a listserver computer This is a kind of
robot moderator that controls distribution of messages on the list In
many cases it also maintains indexes and archives of past postings in a
given discussion group which can be handy if you want to get up to
speed with a discussion or just search for some information related to
it
 Many Bitnet discussion groups are now translated into Usenet
form and carried through Usenet in the bitlistserv hierarchy In
general its probably better to read messages through Usenet if you
can It saves some storage space on your host systems hard drives
 If 50 people subscribe to the same Bitnet list that means 50
copies of each message get stored on the system whereas if 50 people
read a Usenet message thats still only one message that needs storage
on the system It can also save your sanity if the discussion group
generates large numbers of messages Think of opening your emailbox
one day to find 200 messages in it  199 of them from a discussion
group and one of them a real email message thats important to you
 Subscribing and canceling subscriptions is done through an e
mail message to the listserver computer For addressing all
listservers are known as listserv yep at some Bitnet address
This means you will have to add bitnet to the end of the
address if its in a form like this listservmiamiu For example if
you have an interest in environmental issues you might want to
subscribe to the Econet discussion group To subscribe send an email
message to

 listservmiamiubitnet

Some Bitnet listservers are also connected to the Internet so if you
see a listserver address ending in edu you can email the
listserver without adding bitnet to the end
 Always leave the subject line blank in a message to a
listserver Inside the message you tell the listserver what you
want with a series of simple commands

subscribe group Your Name To subscribe to a list where group
 is the list name and Your Name is
 your full name for example
 subscribe econet Henry Fielding

unsubscribe group Your Name To discontinue a group for example
 unsubscribe econet Henry Fielding

list global This sends you a list of all available
 Bitnet discussion groups But be careful
  the list is VERY long

get refcard Sends you a list of other commands you
 can use with a listserver such as
 commands for retrieving past postings
 from a discussion group

 Each of these commands goes on a separate line in your message
and you can use one or all of them If you want to get a list of
all Bitnet discussion groups send email to

 listservbitniceducomedu

Leave the subject line blank and use the list global command
 When you subscribe to a Bitnet group there are two important
differences from Usenet
 First when you want to post a message for others to read in the
discussion group you send a message to the group name at its Bitnet
address Using Econet as an example you would mail the message to

 econetmiamiubitnet

 Note that this is different from the listserv address you used to
subscribe to the group to begin with Use the listserv address ONLY
to subscribe to or unsubscribe from a discussion group If you use the
discussiongroup address to try to subscribe or unsubscribe your message
will go out to every other subscriber many of whom will think unkind
thoughts which they may share with you in an email message
 The second difference relates to sending an email message to the
author of a particular posting Usenet newsreaders such as rn and nn
let you do this with one key But if you hit your R key to respond to
a discussiongroup message your message will go to the listserver
and from there to everybody else on the list This can prove
embarrassing to you and annoying to others To make sure your
message goes just to the person who wrote the posting take down his
email address from the posting and then compose a brandnew message
Remember also that if you see an email address like IZZYINDYVMS its
a Bitnet address
 Two Bitnet lists will prove helpful for delving further into the
network NEWLIST tells you the names of new discussion groups To
subscribe send a message to listservndsuvm1bitnet

 sub NEWLIST Your Name

 INFONETS is the place to go when you have questions about Bitnet
It is also first rate for help on questions about all major computer
networks and how to reach them To subscribe send email to infonets
requestthinkcom

 sub INFONETS Your Name

 Both of these lists are also available on Usenet the former as
bitlistservnewlist the latter as bitlistservinfonets sometimes
bitlistservinfonets





Chapter 6 TELNET




61 MINING THE NET


 Like any large community cyberspace has its libraries places you
can go to look up information or take out a good book Telnet is one of
your keys to these libraries
 Telnet is a program that lets you use the power of the Internet to
connect you to databases library catalogs and other information
resources around the world Want to see what the weathers like in
Vermont Check on crop conditions in Azerbaijan Get more information
about somebody whose name youve seen online Telnet lets you do this
and more
 Alas theres a big but Unlike the phone system Internet is not
yet universal not everybody can use all of its services Almost all
colleges and universities on the Internet provide telnet access So do
all of the forfee publicaccess systems listed in Chapter 1 But the
FreeNet systems do not give you access to every telnet system And if
you are using a publicaccess UUCP or Usenet site you will not have
access to telnet The main reason for this is cost Connecting to the
Internet can easily cost 1000 or more for a leased highspeed phone
line Some databases and file libraries can be queried by email
however well show you how to do that later on In the meantime the
rest of this chapter assumes you are connected to a site with at least
partial Internet access
 Most telnet sites are fairly easy to use and have online help systems
Most also work best and in some cases only with VT100 emulation
Lets dive right in and try one
 At your host systems command line type

 telnet accessusaskca

and hit enter Thats all you have to do to connect to a telnet site
In this case youll be connecting to a service known as Hytelnet which
is a database of computerized library catalogs and other databases
available through telnet You should see something like this

 Trying 12823331 
 Connected to accessusaskca
 Escape character is 


 Ultrix UNIX accessusaskca

 login


 Every telnet site has two addresses  one composed of words that
are easier for people to remember the other a numerical address better
suited for computers The escape character is good to remember When
all else fails hitting your control key and the  key at the same time
will disconnect you and return you to your host system At the login
prompt type

 hytelnet

and hit enter Youll see something like this

 The first choice WHATIS will be highlighted Use your down
and up arrows to move the cursor among the choices Hit enter when you
decide on one Youll get another menu which in turn will bring up
text files telling you how to connect to sites and giving any special
commands or instructions you might need Hytelnet does have one quirk
To move back to where you started for example from a submenu to a
main menu hit the leftarrow key on your computer
 Play with the system You might want to turn on your computers
screencapture or at the very least get out a pen and paper Youre
bound to run across some interesting telnet services that youll want to
try  and youll need their telnet addresses
 As you move around Hytelnet it may seem as if you havent left
your host system  telnet can work that quickly Occasionally when
network loads are heavy however you will notice a delay between the
time you type a command or enter a request and the time the remote
service responds
 To disconnect from Hytelnet and return to your system hit your q
key and enter
 Some telnet computers are set up so that you can only access them
through a specific port In those cases youll always see a number
after their name for example indiacoloradoedu 13 Its important to
include that number because otherwise you may not get in
 In fact try the above address Type

 telnet indiacoloradoedu 13

and hit enter You should see something like this

 Trying 12813814044 

Followed very quickly by this

62 LIBRARY CATALOGS


 Several hundred libraries around the world from the Snohomish
Public Library in Washington State to the Library of Congress are now
available to you through telnet You can use Hytelnet to find their
names telnet addresses and use instructions
 Why would you want to browse a library you cant physically get to
Many libraries share books so if yours doesnt have what youre looking
for you can tell the librarian where he or she can get it Or if you live
in an area where the libraries are not yet online you can use telnet to do
some basic bibliographic research before you head down to the local branch
 There are several different database programs in use by online
libraries Harvards is one of the easier ones to use so lets try it
 Telnet to hollisharvardedu When you connect youll see

 One particularly interesting system is the one run by the Colorado
Alliance of Research Libraries which maintains databases for libraries
throughout Colorado the West and even in Boston
 Telnet paccarlorg
 Follow the simple login instructions When you get a menu type 72
even though that is not listed which takes you to the Pikes Peak Library
District which serves the city of Colorado Springs
 Several years ago its librarians realized they could use their
database program not just for books but for cataloging city records and
community information as well Today if you want to look up municipal
ordinances or city records you only have to type in the word youre
looking for and youll get back cites of the relevant laws or decisions
 Carl will also connect you to the University of Hawaii library which
like the one in Colorado Springs has more than just bibliographic material
online One of its features is an online Hawaiian almanac that can tell
you everything you ever wanted to know about Hawaiians including the
number injured in boogieboard accidents each year seven

 You choose one of the three databases now online one on AIDS and
then ask questions in English
 Ask the AIDS database When was AIDS first discovered and it
answers
 The first case of AIDS in North America was diagnosed in 1979
Before that it existed in Africa probably beginning in the 1950s
AIDS was discovered in North America when a number of young men with a
history of homosexuality developed a rare type of cancer called
Kaposis sarcoma
 Sometimes you do have to rephrase your question For example
when asked What is the link between AIDS and drug use the computer
responds
 I know two things about drugs the drugs that are used to treat
people with AIDS and the risks that drug users have in getting AIDS
Please ask about treatments or drug users

65 PUTTING THE FINGER ON SOMEONE

 Finger is a handy little program which lets you find out more about
people on the Net  and lets you tell others on the Net more about
yourself
 Finger uses the same concept as telnet or ftp But it works with
only one file called plan yes with a period in front This is a
text file an Internet user creates with a text editor in his home
directory You can put your phone number in there tell a little bit
about yourself or write almost anything at all
 To finger somebody elses plan file type this at the command
line

 finger emailaddress

where emailaddress is the persons email address Youll get back a
display that shows the last time the person was online whether
theyve gotten any new mail since that time and what if anything is
in their plan file
 Some people and institutions have come up with creative uses for
these plan files letting you do everything from checking the weather
in Massachusetts to getting the latest baseball standings Try
fingering these email addresses

 forecasts for regions in Massachusetts

66 FINDING SOMEONE ON THE NET


 So you have a friend and you want to find out if he has an Internet
account to which you can write The quickest way may be to just pick up
the phone call him and ask him Although there are a variety of white
pages services available on the Internet they are far from complete 
college students users of commercial services such as CompuServe and
many Internet publicaccess sites and many others simply wont be
listed Major email providers are working on a universal directory
system but that could be some time away
 In the meantime a couple of white pages services might give you
some leads or even just entertain you as you look up famous people or
longlost acquaintances
 The whois directory provides names email and postal mail address
and often phone numbers for people listed in it To use it telnet to

 internicnet

No logon is needed The quickest way to use it is to type

 whois name

at the prompt where name is the last name or organization name youre
looking for
 Another service worth trying especially since it seems to give
beginners fewer problems is the Knowbot Information Service reachable by
telnet at

 infocnrirestonvaus 185

Again no logon is needed This service actually searches through a
variety of other white pages systems including the user directory for
MCIMail To look for somebody type

 query name

where name is the last name of the person youre looking for You can
get details of other commands by hitting a question mark at the prompt
You can also use the knowbot system by email Start a message to

 netaddressinfocnrirestonvaus

You can leave the subject line blank As your message type

 query name

for the simplest type of search If you want details on more complex
searches add another line

 man

 Another way to search is via the Usenet name server This is a
system at MIT that keeps track of the email addresses of everybody who
posts a Usenet message that appears at MIT It works by email Send a
message to

 mailserverrtfmmitedu

Leave the subject line blank As your message write

 send usenetaddresseslastname

where lastname is the last name of the person youre looking for


67 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

  Nothing happens when you try to connect to a telnet site
 The site could be down for maintenance or problems
  You get a host unavailable message The telnet site is down
for some reason
 Try again later
  You get a host unknown message
 Check your spelling of the site name
  You type in a password on a telnet site that requires one and
you get a login incorrect message
 Try logging in again If you get the message again hit your
control and  keys at the same time to disengage and return to your host
system
  You cant seem to disconnect from a telnet site
 Use control to disengage and return to your host system

Chapter 7 FTP



71 TONS OF FILES

 Hundreds of systems connected to Internet have file libraries or
archives accessible to the public Much of this consists of free or low
cost shareware programs for virtually every make of computer If you
want a different communications program for your IBM or feel like
playing a new game on your Amiga youll be able to get it from the Net
 But there are also libraries of documents as well If you
want a copy of a recent US Supreme Court decision you can find it on
the Net Copies of historical documents from the Magna Carta to the
Declaration of Independence are also yours for the asking along with a
translation of a telegram from Lenin ordering the execution of
rebellious peasants You can also find song lyrics poems even
summaries of every Lost in Space episode ever made You can also find
extensive files detailing everything you could ever possibly want to know
about the Net itself First youll see how to get these files then
well show you where theyre kept
 The commonest way to get these files is through the file transfer
protocol or ftp As with telnet not all systems that connect to the
Net have access to ftp However if your system is one of these youll
be able to get many of these files through email see the next chapter
 Starting ftp is as easy as using telnet At your host systems command
line type

 ftp sitename

and hit enter where sitename is the address of the ftp site you want
to reach One major difference between telnet and ftp is that it is
considered bad form to connect to most ftp sites during their business
hours generally 6 am to 6 pm local time This is because
transferring files across the network takes up considerable computing
power which during the day is likely to be needed for whatever the
computers main function is There are some ftp sites that are
accessible to the public 24 hours a day though Youll find these noted
in the list of ftp sites in section 76


72 YOUR FRIEND ARCHIE


 How do you find a file you want though
 Until a few years ago this could be quite the pain  there was
no master directory to tell you where a given file might be stored on
the Net Whod want to slog through hundreds of file libraries looking
for something
 Alan Emtage Bill Heelan and Peter Deutsch students at McGill
University in Montreal asked the same question Unlike the weather
though they did something about it
 They created a database system called archie that would
periodically call up file libraries and basically find out what they had
available In turn anybody could dial into archie type in a file name
and see where on the Net it was available Archie currently catalogs
close to 1000 file libraries around the world
 Today there are three ways to ask archie to find a file for you
through telnet client Archie program on your own host system or e
mail All three methods let you type in a full or partial file name and
will tell you where on the Net its stored
 If you have access to telnet you can telnet to one of the following
addresses archiemcgillca archiesuranet archieunledu
archieansnet or archierutgersedu If asked for a login name type

 archie

and hit enter
 When you connect the key command is prog which you use in this
form

 prog filename

followed by enter where filename is the program or file youre
looking for If youre unsure of a files complete name try typing in
part of the name For example PKZIP will work as well as
PKZIP204EXE The system does not support DOS or Unix wildcards
If you ask archie to look for PKZIP it will tell you it couldnt
find anything by that name One thing to keep in mind is that a file is
not necessarily the same as a program  it could also be a document
This means you can use archie to search for say everything online
related to the Beetles as well as computer programs and graphics files
 A number of Net sites now have their own archie programs that
take your request for information and pass it onto the nearest archie
database  ask your system administrator if she has it online These
client programs seem to provide information a lot more quickly than the
actual archie itself If it is available at your host systems command
line type

 archie s filename

where filename is the program or document youre looking for and hit
enter The s tells the program to ignore case in a file name and lets
you search for partial matches You might actually want to type it this
way

 archie s filenamemore

which will stop the output every screen handy if there are many sites
that carry the file you want Or you could open a file on your computer
with your textlogging function
 The third way for people without access to either of the above is e
mail
 Send a message to archiequichecsmcgillca You can leave the
subject line blank Inside the message type

 prog filename

where filename is the file youre looking for You can ask archie to
look up several programs by putting their names on the same prog line
like this

 prog file1 file2 file3

 Within a few hours archie will write back with a list of the
appropriate sites
 In all three cases if there is a system that has your file
youll get a response that looks something like this

 Host sumexaimstanfordedu

 Location infomaccomm
 FILE rwrr 258256 Feb 15 1707 zterm09hqx
 Location infomacmisc
 FILE rwrr 7490 Sep 12 1991 ztermsys7coloriconshqx


 Chances are you will get a number of similar looking responses
for each program The host is the system that has the file The
Location tells you which directory to look in when you connect to
that system Ignore the funnylooking collections of rs and hyphens
for now After them come the size of the file or directory listing
in bytes the date it was uploaded and the name of the file


73 GETTING THE FILES

 Now you want to get that file
 Assuming your host site does have ftp you connect in a similar
fashion to telnet by typing

 ftp sumexaimstanfordedu

or the name of whichever site you want to reach Hit enter If the
connection works youll see this

 Connected to sumexaimstanfordedu
 220 SUMEXAIM FTP server Version 4196 Mon Jan 13 135223 PST 1992 ready
 Name sumexaimstanfordeduadamg

 If nothing happens after a minute or so hit controlC to return
to your host systems command line But if it has worked type

 anonymous

and hit enter Youll see a lot of references on the Net to
anonymous ftp This is how it gets its name  you dont really have
to tell the library site what your name is The reason is that these
sites are set up so that anybody can gain access to certain public
files while letting people with accounts on the sites to log on and
access their own personal files Next youll be asked for your
password As a password use your email address This will then come
up

 230 Guest connection accepted Restrictions apply

 226 Transfer complete
 ftp

 Ack Lets decipher this Rosetta Stone
 First ls is the ftp command for displaying a directory you can
actually use dir as well but if youre used to MSDOS this could lead
to confusion when you try to use dir on your host system where it wont
work so its probably better to just remember to always use ls for a
directory while online
 The very first letter on each line tells you whether the listing is
for a directory or a file If the first letter is a d or an l
its a directory Otherwise its a file
 The rest of that weird set of letters and dashes consist of flags
that tell the ftp site who can look at change or delete the file You
can safely ignore it You can also ignore the rest of the line until you
get to the second number the one just before the date This tells you
how large the file is in bytes If the line is for a directory the
 number gives you a rough indication of how many items are in that
directory  a directory listing of 512 bytes is relatively small Next
comes the date the file or directory was uploaded followed finally by
its name
 Notice the READMEPOSTING file up at the top of the directory Most
archive sites have a read me document which usually contains some
basic information about the site its resources and how to use them
Lets get this file both for the information in it and to see how to
transfer files from there to here At the ftp prompt type

 get README

 and hit enter Note that ftp sites are no different from Unix sites in
general they are casesensitive Youll see something like this

 200 PORT command successful
 150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for README 4444 bytes
 226 Transfer complete 4444 bytes received in 1177seconds 38 Kbytess

And thats it The file is now located in your home directory on your host
system from which you can now download it to your own computer The
simple get command is the key to transferring a file from an archive
site to your host system
 If you want to download more than one file at a time say a series
of documents use mget instead of get for example

 mget txt

This will transfer copies of every file ending with txt in the given
directory Before each file is copied youll be asked if youre sure
you want it Despite this mget could still save you considerable
time  you wont have to type in every single file name If you want to
save even more time and are sure you really want ALL of the given files
type

 prompt

before you do the mget command This will turn off the prompt and all
the files will be zapped right into your home directory

 There is one other command to keep in mind If you want to get a
copy of a computer program type

 bin

and hit enter This tells the ftp site and your host site that you are
sending a binary file ie a program Most ftp sites now use binary
format as a default but its a good idea to do this in case youve
connected to one of the few that doesnt
 To switch to a directory type

 cd directoryname

substituting the name of the directory you want to access and hit
enter Type

 ls

and hit enter to get the file listing for that particular directory
To move back up the directory tree type

 cd 

note the space between the d and the first period and hit enter Or
you could type

 cdup

and hit enter Keep doing this until you get to the directory of
interest Alternately if you already know the directory path of the
file you want from our friend archie after you connect you could
simply type

 get directorysubdirectoryfilename

 On many sites files meant for public consumption are in the pub
or public directory sometimes youll see an info directory
 Almost every site has a bin directory which at first glance
sounds like a bin in which interesting stuff might be dumped But it
actually stands for binary and is simply a place for the system
administrator to store the programs that run the ftp system Lostfound
is another directory that looks interesting but actually never has
anything of public interest in them
 Before you saw how to use archie From our example you can see
that some system administrators go a little berserk when naming files
Fortunately theres a way for you to rename the file as its being
transferred Using our archie example youd type

 get ztermsys7coloriconshqx ztermhqx

and hit enter Instead of having to deal constantly with a file called
ztermsys7coloriconshqx youll now have one called simply
ztermhqx
 Those last three letters bring up something else Many program files
are compressed to save on space and transmission time In order to
actually use them youll have to use an uncompress program on them first


74 ODD LETTERS  DECODING FILE ENDINGS


 There are a wide variety of compression methods in use You can
tell which method was used by the last one to three letters at the end of
a file Here are some of the more common ones and what youll need to un
compress the files they create most of these decompression programs can
be located through archie

txt or TXT By itself this means the file is a document rather than a
 program

ps or PS A PostScript document in Adobes page description
 language You can print this file on any PostScript
 capable printer or use a previewer like GNU projects
 GhostScript

doc or DOC Another common extension for documents No decompression
 is needed unless it is followed by

Z This indicates a Unix compression method To uncompress
 type

 uncompress filenameZ

 and hit enter at your host systems command line If the
 file is a compressed text file you can read it online by
 instead typing

 zcat filenametxtZ more

 u16zip is an MSDOS program that will let you download
 such a file and uncompress it on your own computer The
 Macintosh equivalent program is called MacCompress use
 archie to find these

zip or ZIP These indicate the file has been compressed with a common
 MSDOS compression program known as PKZIP use archie to
 find PKZIP204EXE Many Unix systems will let you unZIP
 a file with a program called well unzip

gz A Unix version of ZIP To uncompress type

 gunzip filenamegz

 at your host systems command line

zoo or ZOO A Unix and MSDOS compression format Use a program called
 zoo to uncompress

Hqx or hqx Mactintosh compression format Requires the BinHex program

shar or Another Unix format Use unshar to uncompress
Shar

tar Another Unix format often used to compress several related
 files into one large file Most Unix systems will have a
 program called tar for untarring such files Often a
 tarred file will also be compressed with the gz method
 so you first have to use uncompress and then tar

sit or Sit A Mactinosh format that requires the StuffIt program

ARC Another MSDOS format which requires the use of the ARC
 or ARCE programs

LHZ Another MSDOS format requires the use of LHARC

 A few last words of caution Check the size of a file before you get
it The Net moves data at phenomenal rates of speed But that 500000
byte file that gets transferred to your host system in a few seconds
could take more than an hour or two to download to your computer if
youre using a 2400baud modem Your host system may also have limits on
the amount of bytes you can store online at any one time Also although
it is really extremely unlikely you will ever get a file infected with a
virus if you plan to do much downloading over the Net youd be wise to
invest in a good antiviral program just in case


75 THE KEYBOARD CABAL


 System administrators are like everybody else  they try to make
things easier for themselves And when you sit in front of a keyboard
all day that can mean trying everything possible to reduce the number
of keys you actually have to hit each day
 Unfortunately that can make it difficult for the rest of us
 Youve already read about bin and lostfound directories Etc is
another seemingly interesting directory that turns out to be another
place to store files used by the ftp site itself Again nothing of any
real interest
 Then once you get into the actual file libraries youll find that
in many cases files will have such nondescriptive names as V11
AKTXT The best known example is probably a set of several hundred
files known as RFCs which provide the basic technical and
organizational information on which much of the Internet is built
These files can be found on many ftp sites but always in a form such as
RFC101TXT RFC102TXT and so on with no clue whatsoever as to what
information they contain
 Fortunately almost all ftp sites have a Rosetta Stone to help
you decipher these names Most will have a file named README or some
variant that gives basic information about the system Then most
directories will either have a similar README file or will have an index
that does give brief descriptions of each file These are usually the
first file in a directory and often are in the form 00INDEXTXT Use
the ftp command to get this file You can then scan it online or
download it to see which files you might be interested in
 Another file you will frequently see is called lslRZ This contains
a listing of every file on the system but without any descriptions the
name comes from the Unix command ls lR which gives you a listing of all
the files in all your directories The Z at the end means the file has
been compressed which means you will have to use a Unix uncompress command
before you can read the file
 And finally we have those system administrators who almost seem to
delight in making things difficult  the ones who take full advantage of
Unixs ability to create absurdly long file names On some FTP sites you
will see file names as long as 80 characters or so full of capital letters
underscores and every other orthographic device that will make it almost
impossible for you to type the file name correctly when you try to get it
Your secret weapon here is the mget command Just type mget a space and
the first five or six letters of the file name followed by an asterisk for
example

 mget This_F

The FTP site will ask you if you want to get the file that begins with that
name If there are several files that start that way you might have to
answer n a few times but its still easier than trying to recreate a
ludicrously long file name


76 SOME INTERESTING FTP SITES


 What follows is a list of some interesting ftp sites arranged by

long file names  so long they may scroll off the end of your screen if

just one of the files it probably makes more sense to use mget than get
This way you will be asked on each file whether you want to get it
otherwise you may wind up frustrated because the system will keep telling
you the file you want doesnt exist since you may miss the end of its
name due to the scrolling problem

77 ncftp  NOW YOU TELL ME


 If youre lucky the people who run your host system or public
access site have installed a program called ncftp which takes some of
the edges off the ftp process
 For starters when you use ncftp instead of plain old ftp you no
longer have to worry about misspelling anonymous when you connect The
program does it for you And once youre in instead of getting line
after line filled with dashes xs rs and ds you only get listings of
the files or directories themselves if youre used to MSDOS the
display you get will be very similar to that produced by the dirw
command The program even creates a list of the ftp sites youve used
most recently so you can pick from that list instead of trying to
remember some incredibly complex ftp site name
 Launching the program assuming your site has it is easy At the
command prompt type

 ncftp sitename

where sitename is the site you want to reach alternately you could
type just ncftp and then use its open command Once connected you can
use the same ftp commands youve become used to such as ls get and
mget Entries that end in a  are directories to which you can switch
with cd others are files you can get A couple of useful ncftp commands
include type which lets you change the type of file transfer from ASCII
to binary for example and size which lets you see how large a file is
before you get it for example

 size declarationtxt

would tell you how large the declarationtxt file is before you get it
When you say bye to disconnect from a site ncftp remembers the last
directory you were in so that the next time you connect to the site you
are put back into that directory automatically If you type

 help

youll get a list of files you can read to extend the power of the
program even further


78 PROJECT GUTENBERG  ELECTRONIC BOOKS

 Project Gutenberg coordinated by Michael Hart has a fairly
ambitious goal to make more than 10000 books and other documents
available electronically by the year 2001 In 1993 the project uploaded
an average of four books a month to its ftp sites in 1994 they hope to
double the pace
 Begun in 1971 the project already maintains a library of hundreds
of books and stories from Aesops Fables to Through the Looking Glass
available for the taking It also has a growing number of current
affairs documents such as the CIAs annual World Factbook almanac
 Besides nptnorg Project Gutenberg texts can be retrieved from
mrcnextcsouiucedu in the etext directory


79 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG


  You get a host unavailable message The ftp site is down for
some reason
 Try again later
  You get a host unknown message
 Check your spelling of the site name
  You misspell anonymous when logging in and get a message
telling you a password is required for whatever you typed in
 Type something in hit enter type bye hit enter and try again
Alternately try typing ftp instead of anonymous It will work on a
surprising number of sites Or just use ncftp if your site has it and
never worry about this again


710 FYI

 Liberal use of archie will help you find specific files or
documents For information on new or interesting ftp sites try the
comparchives newsgroup on Usenet You can also look in the compmisc
compsourceswanted or newsanswers newsgroups on Usenet for lists of ftp
sites posted every month by Tom Czarnik and Jon Granrose
 The comparchives newsgroup carries news of new ftp sites and
interesting new files on existing sites
 In the compvirus newsgroup on Usenet look for postings that list
ftp sites carrying antiviral software for Amiga MSDOS Macintosh
Atari and other computers
 The compsysibmpcdigest and compsysmacdigest newsgroups
provide information about new MSDOS and Macintosh programs as well as
answers to questions from users of those computers





Chapter 8 GOPHERS WAISs AND THE WORLDWIDE WEB




81 GOPHERS


 Even with tools like Hytelnet and archie telnet and ftp can still
be frustrating There are all those telnet and ftp addresses to
remember Telnet services often have their own unique commands And
oh those weird directory and file names
 But now that the Net has become a rich repository of information
people are developing ways to make it far easier to find and retrieve
information and files Gophers and WideArea Information Servers WAISs
are two services that could ultimately make the Internet as easy to
navigate as commercial networks such as CompuServe or Prodigy
 Both gophers and WAISs essentially take a request for information
and then scan the Net for it so you dont have to Both also work
through menus  instead of typing in some long sequence of characters
you just move a cursor to your choice and hit enter Gophers even
let you select files and programs from ftp sites this way
 Lets first look at gophers named for the official mascot of the
University of Minnesota where the system was developed
 Many publicaccess sites now have gophers online To use one type

 gopher

at the command prompt and hit enter If you know your site does not have
a gopher or if nothing happens when you type that telnet to

 consultantmicroumnedu

At the login prompt type

 gopher

and hit enter Youll be asked what type of terminal emulation youre
using after which youll see something like this

 Internet Gopher Information Client v103

 7 News
 8 Other Gopher and Information Servers
 9 Phone Books
 10 Search lots of places at the U of M 
 11 University of Minnesota Campus Information

Press  for Help q to Quit u to go up a menu Page 11

 Assuming youre using VT100 or some other VT emulation youll be
able to move among the choices with your up and down arrow keys When
you have your cursor on an entry that looks interesting just hit enter
and youll either get a new menu of choices a database entry form or a
text file depending on what the menu entry is linked to more on how to
tell which youll get in a moment
 Gophers are great for exploring the resources of the Net Just keep
making choices to see what pops up Play with it see where it takes
you Some choices will be documents When you read one of these and
either come to the end or hit a lowercase q to quit reading it youll
be given the choice of saving a copy to your home directory or emailing
it to yourself Other choices are simple databases that let you enter a
word to look for in a particular database To get back to where you
started on a gopher hit your u key at a menu prompt which will move you
back up through the gopher menu structure much like cd  in ftp
 Notice that one of your choices above is Internet file server ftp
sites Choose this and youll be connected to a modified archie
program  an archie with a difference When you search for a file
through a gopher archie youll get a menu of sites that have the file
youre looking for just as with the old archie Only now instead of
having to write down or remember an ftp address and directory all you
have to do is position the cursor next to one of the numbers in the menu
and hit enter Youll be connected to the ftp site from which you can
then choose the file you want This time move the cursor to the file
you want and hit a lowercase s Youll be asked for a name in your home
directory to use for the file after which the file will be copied to
your home system Unfortunately this filetransfer process does not yet
work with all publicaccess sites for computer programs and compressed
files If it doesnt work with yours youll have to get the file the
oldfashioned way via anonymous ftp
 In addition to ftp sites there are hundreds of databases and
libraries around the world accessible through gophers There is not yet
a common gopher interface for library catalogs so be prepared to follow
the online directions more closely when you use gopher to connect to
one
 Gopher menu entries that end in a  are gateways to another menu of
options Entries that end in a period are text graphics or program
files which you can retrieve to your home directory or email to
yourself or to somebody else A line that ends in  or CSO
represents a request you can make to a database for information The
difference is that  entries call up oneline interfaces in which you
can search for a keyword or words while CSO brings up an electronic
form with several fields for you to fill out you might see this in
online White Pages directories at colleges
 Gophers actually let you perform some relatively sophisticated
Boolean searches For example if you want to search only for files that
contain the words MSDOS and Macintosh youd type

 msdos and macintosh

gophers are not casesensitive in the keyword field Alternately if
you want to get a list of files that mention either MSDOS or
Macintosh youd type

 msdos or macintosh


82 BURROWING DEEPER


 As fascinating as it can be to explore gopherspace you might one
day want to quickly retrieve some information or a file Or you might
grow tired of calling up endless menus to get to the one you want
Fortunately there are ways to make even gophers easier to use
 One is with archies friend veronica it allegedly is an acronym
but dont believe that for a second who does for gopherspace what
archie does for ftp sites
 In most gophers youll find veronica by selecting Other gopher and
information services at the main menu and then Searching through
gopherspace using veronica Select this and youll get something like
this

 Internet Gopher Information Client v11

 11 Search gopherspace at University of Cologne 


Press  for Help q to Quit u to go up a menu Page 11

 A few choices there First the difference between searching
directory titles and just plain ol gopherspace If you already know the
sort of directory youre looking for say a directory containing MSDOS
programs do a directorytitle search But if youre not sure what kind
of directory your information might be in then do a general
gopherspace search In general it doesnt matter which of the particular
veronicas you use  they should all be able to produce the same results
The reason there is more than one is because the Internet has become so
popular that only one veronica or one gopher or one of almost anything
would quickly be overwhelmed by all the information requests from around
the world
 You can use veronica to search for almost anything Want to find
museums that might have online displays from their exhibits Try
searching for museum Looking for a copy of the Declaration of
Independence Try declaration
 In many cases your search will bring up a new gopher menu of
choices to try
 Say you want to impress those guests coming over for dinner on
Friday by cooking cherries flambe If you were to call up veronica and
type in flambe after calling up veronica you would soon get a menu
listing several flambe recipes including one called dessert flambe
Put your cursor on that line of the menu and hit enter and youll find
its a menu for cherries flambe Then hit your q key to quit and gopher
will ask you if you want to save the file in your home directory on your
publicaccess site or whether you want to email it somewhere
 As you can see you can use veronica as an alternative to archie
which because of the Internets growing popularity seems to take longer
and longer to work
 In addition to archie and veronica we now also have jugheads no
bettys yet though These work the same as veronicas but their
searches are limited to the specific gopher systems on which they reside
 If there are particular gopher resources you use frequently there
are a couple of ways to get to them even more directly
 One is to use gopher in a manner similar to the way you can use
telnet If you know a particular gophers Internet address often the
same as its telnet or ftp address you can connect to it directly
rather than going through menus For example say you want to use the
gopher at infoumdedu If your publicaccess site has a gopher system
installed type this

 gopher infoumdedu

at your command prompt and youll be connected
 But even that can get tedious if there are several gophers you use
frequently Thats where bookmarks come in Gophers let you create a
list of your favorite gopher sites and even database queries Then
instead of digging ever deeper into the gopher directory structure you
just call up your bookmark list and select the service you want
 To create a bookmark for a particular gopher site first call up
gopher Then go through all the gopher menus until you get to the menu
you want Type a capital A Youll be given a suggested name for the
bookmark enty which you can change if you want by backspacing over the
suggestion and typing in your own When done hit enter Now whenever
youre in gopherspace and want to zip back to that particular gopher
service just hit your V key upper or lowercase in this instance
gopher doesnt care anywhere within gopher This will bring up a list
of your bookmarks Move to the one you want and hit enter and youll be
connected
 Using a capital A is also good for saving particular database or
veronica queries that you use frequently for example searching for
news stories on a particular topic if your publicaccess site maintains
an indexed archive of wireservice news
 Instead of a capital A you can also hit a lowercase a This will
bring you to the particular line within a menu rather than show you the
entire menu
 If you ever want to delete a bookmark hit V within gopher select
the item you want to get rid of and then hit your D key
 One more hint
 If you want to find the address of a particular gopher service hit

85 WIDEAREA INFORMATION SERVERS


 Now you know there are hundreds of databases and library catalogs
you can search through But as you look you begin to realize that each
seems to have its own unique method for searching If you connect to
several this can become a pain Gophers reduce this problem somewhat
 Widearea information servers promise another way to zero in on
information hidden on the Net In a WAIS the user sees only one
interface  the program worries about how to access information on
dozens even hundreds of different databases You tell give a WAIS a
word and it scours the net looking for places where its mentioned You
get a menu of documents each ranked according to how relevant to your
search the WAIS thinks it is
 Like gophers WAIS client programs can already be found on many
publicaccess Internet sites If your system has a WAIS client type

 swais

at the command prompt and hit enter the s stands for simple If it
doesnt telnet to bbsoituncedu which is run by the University of North
Carolina At the login prompt type

 bbs

and hit enter Youll be asked to register and will then get a list of
bulletins which are various files explaining how the system works
When done with those hit your Q key and youll get another menu Hit 4
for the simple WAIS client and youll see something like this

Keywords

space selects w for keywords arrows move return searches q quits or 

Each line represents a different database the au at the end of some of
them means they are in Australia the fr on the last line represents a
database in France And this is just the first page If you type a
capital K youll go to the next page there are several pages
Hitting a capital J will move you back a page
 The first thing you want to do is tell the WAIS program which
databases you want searched To select a database move the cursor bar
over the line you want using your down and up arrow keys and hit your
space bar An asterisk will appear next to the line number Repeat this
until youve selected all of the databases you want searched Then hit
your W key after which youll be prompted for the key words youre
looking for You can type in an entire line of these words  separate
each with a space not a comma
 Hit return and the search begins
 Lets say youre utterly fascinated with wheat So you might select
agriculturalmarketnews to find its current world price But you also
want to see if it has any religious implications so you choose the

decisions involving the plant Choose supremecourt How about synonyms
Try rogetthesaurus and just plain thesaurus
 Now hit w and type in wheat Hit enter and the WAIS program begins

offline and if so when they might be ready for a search In about a
minute the program tells you how many hits its found Then you get a new

databases just to find these relatively trivial examples


86 THE WORLDWIDE WEB


 Developed by researchers at the European Particle Physics
Laboratory in Geneva the WorldWide Web is somewhat similar to a WAIS
But its designed on a system known as hypertext Words in one document
are linked to other documents Its sort of like sitting with an
encyclopedia  youre reading an article see a reference that
intrigues you and so flip the pages to look up that reference

87 CLIENTS OR HOW TO SNARE MORE ON THE WEB


 If you are used to plainvanilla Unix or MSDOS then the way these
gophers and WAISs work seems quite straightforward But if youre used
to a computer with a graphical interface such as a Macintosh an IBM
compatible with Windows or a Next youll probably regard their
interfaces as somewhat primitive And even to a veteran MSDOS user the
WorldWide Web interface is rather clunky and some of the documents and
files on the Web now use special formatting that would confuse your poor
computer
 There are however ways to integrate these services into your
graphical user interface In fact there are now ways to tie into the
Internet directly rather than relying on whatever interface your
publicaccess system uses through what are known as client programs
These programs provide graphical interfaces for everything from ftp to
the WorldWide Web
 There is now a growing number of these client programs for
everything from ftp to gopher PSI of Reston Va which offers
nationwide Internet access in fact requires its customers to use these
programs Using protocols known as SLIP and PPP these programs
communicate with the Net using the same basic data packets as much larger
computers online
 Beyond integration with your own computers desktop client
programs let you do more than one thing at once on the net  while youre
downloading a large file in one window you can be chatting with a
friend through an Internet chat program in another
 Unfortunately using a client program can cost a lot of money Some
require you to be connected directly to the Internet through an Ethernet
network for example Others work through modem protocols such as SLIP
but publicaccess sites that allow such access may charge anywhere from
25 to 200 a month extra for the service
 Your system administrator can give you more information on setting
up one of these connections


88 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

 As the Internet grows ever more popular its resources come under
more of a strain If you try to use gopher in the middle of the day at
least on the East Coast of the US youll sometimes notice that it
takes a very long time for particular menus or database searches to come
up Sometimes youll even get a message that there are too many people
connected to whichever service youre trying to use and so you cant get
in The only alternative is to either try again in 20 minutes or so or
wait until later in the day when the load might be lower When this
happens in veronica try one of the other veronica entries
 When you retrieve a file through gopher youll sometimes be asked
if you want to store it under some ludicrously long name there go our
friends the system administrators again using 128 characters just
because Unix lets them With certain MSDOS communications programs if
that name is longer than one line you wont be able to backspace all the
way back to the first line if you want to give it a simpler name
Backspace as far as you can Then when you get ready to download it to
your home computer remember that the file name will be truncated on your
end because of MSDOSs filenaming limitations Worse your computer
might even reject the whole thing What to do Instead of saving it to
your home directory mail it to yourself It should show up in your mail
by the time you exit gopher Then use your mail command for saving it
to your home directory  at which point you can name it anything you want
Now you can download it


89 FYI


 David Riggins maintains a list of gophers by type and category You
can find the most recent one at the ftp site ftpeinetnet in the pub
directory Look for a file with a name like gopherjewelstxt
Alternately you can get on a mailing list to get the latest version sent
to your emailbox automatically Send a mail message to gopherjewelslist
requesttpiscactusorg yep that first part is all one word Leave
the subject line blank and as a message write SUBSCRIBE
 Blake Gumprecht maintains a list of gopher and telnet sites related
to or run by the government He posts it every three weeks to the
newsanswers and socanswers newsgroups on Usenet It can also be
obtained via anonymous ftp from rtfmmitedu as
pubusenetnewsanswersusgovtnetpointers
 Students at the University of Michigans School of Information and
Library Studies recently compiled separate lists of Internet resources
in 11 specific areas from aeronautics to theater They can be obtained
via gopher at gopherlibumichedu in the Whats New and Featured
Resources menu
 The Usenet newsgroups compinfosystemsgopher and
compinfosystemswais are places to go for technical discussions about
gophers and WAISs respectively
 The Interpedia project is an attempt to take gopher one step
further by creating an online repository of all of the interesting and
useful information availble on the Net and from its users To get on the
mailing list for the project send an email message with a subject
of subscribe to interpediarequestteleramalmcom You can get
supporting documentation for the project via anonymous ftp at ftplmcom

Chapter 9 ADVANCED EMAIL



91 THE FILES IN THE MAIL


 Email by itself is a powerful tool and by now you may be
sending email messages all over the place You might even be on a
mailing list or two But there is a lot more to email than just
sending messages If your host system does not have access to ftp
or it doesnt have access to every ftp site on the Net you can have
programs and files sent right to your mailbox And using some simple
techniques you can use email to send data files such as spreadsheets
or even whole programs to friends and colleagues around the world
 A key to both is a set of programs known as encoders and
decoders For all its basic power Net email has a big problem it
cant handle graphics characters or the control codes found in even
the simplest of computer programs Encoders however can translate
these into forms usable in email while decoders turn them back into
a form that you can actually use If you are using a Unixbased host
system chances are it already has an encoder and decoder online that
you can use These programs will also let you use programs posted in
several Usenet newsgroups such as compbinariesibmpc
 If both you and the person with whom you want to exchange files use
Unix host systems youre in luck because virtually all Unix
host systems have encoderdecoder programs online For now lets
assume thats the case First upload the file you want to send to your
friend to your host site ask your system administrator how to upload a
file to your name or home directory if you dont already know how
Then type

 uuencode file file  fileuu

and hit enter File is the name of the file you want to prepare for
mailing and yes you have to type the name twice The  is a Unix
command that tells the system to call the encoded file fileuu
you could actually call it anything you want
 Now to get it into a mail message The quick and dirty way is to
type

 mail friend

where friend is your friends address At the subject line tell
her the name of the enclosed file When you get the blank line type

 r fileuu

or whatever you called the file and hit enter on some systems the 
may not work if so ask your system administrator what to use This
inserts the file into your mail message Hit controlD and your file
is on its way
 On the other end when your friend goes into her mailbox she
should transfer it to her home directory Then she should type

 uudecode filename

and hit enter This creates a new file in her name directory with
whatever name you originally gave it She can then download it to her
own computer Before she can actually use it though shell have to
open it up with a text processor and delete the mail header that has
been stamped on it If you use a mailer program that automatically
appends a signature tell her about that so she can delete that as
well


92 RECEIVING FILES


 If somebody sends you a file through the mail youll have to go
through a couple of steps to get it into a form you can actually use If
you are using the simple mail program go into mail and type

 w  filename

where  is the number of the message you want to transfer and
filename is what you want to call the resulting file In pine call
up the message and hit your O key and then E Youll then be asked
for a file name In elm call up the message and hit your S key
Youll get something that looks like this

 filerequest

 Type a new file name and hit enter if you hit enter without
typing a file name the message will be saved to another mail folder
not your home directory
 In all three cases exit the mail program to return to your host
systems command line Because the file has been encoded for mail
delivery you now have to run a decoder At the command line type

 uudecode filename

where filename is the file you created while in mail Uudecode will
create a new uncompressed binary file In some cases you may have to
run it through some other programs for example if it is in tar form
but generally it should now be ready for you to download to your own
computer on which you might then have to run a decompressor program
such as PKXZIP


93 FILES TO NONINTERNET SITES


 What if your friend only connects with a nonUnix system such as
CompuServe or MCIMail There are programs available for MSDOS Apple
and Amiga computers that will encode and decode files Of course since
you cant send one of these programs to your friend via email how would
she unencode it youll have to mail the oldfashioned way or give
her a diskette with the program on it first Then she can get the file
by email and go through the above process only on her own computer to
get a usable file Remember to give her an encoder program as well if
she wants to send you files in return
 For MSDOS machines youll want to get uunecodecom and
uudecodecom Both can be found through anonymous ftp at
wuarchivewustledu in the mirrorsmsdosstarter directory The MS
DOS version is as easy to use as the Unix one Just type

 uudecode filenameext

and hit enter
 Mac users should get a program called uutool which can be found
in the infomacutil directory on sumexaimstanfordedu
 Think twice before sending somebody a giant file Although large
sites connected directly to the Internet can probably handle megafiles
many smaller systems cannot Some commercial systems such as CompuServe
and MCIMail limit the size of mail messages their users can receive
Fidonet doesnt even allow encoded messages In general a file size of
30000 or so bytes is a safe upper limit for nonInternet systems


94 GETTING FTP FILES VIA EMAIL


 To help people without ftp access a number of ftp sites have set up
mail servers also known as archive servers that allow you to get files
via email You send a request to one of these machines and they send
back the file you want As with ftp youll be able to find everything
from historical documents to software but please note that if you do
have access to ftp that method is always quicker and ties up fewer
resources than using email
 Some interesting or useful mail servers include
 mailserverrtfmmitedu Files of frequently asked questions
related to Usenet statebystate lists of US representatives and
Senators and their addresses and office phone numbers
 archiveserverefforg Information about the Electronic Frontier
Foundation documents about legal issues on the Net
 archiveservercswideneredu Back copies of the Computer
Underground Digest and every possible fact you could want to know about
The Simpsons
 netlibuunetuunet Programs for many types of personal computers
archives of past postings from many Usenet newsgroups
 archiveserveramesarcnasagov Spacerelated text and graphics
GIFformat files
 servicenicddnmil Detailed information about Internet
 Most mail servers work pretty much the same  you send an email
message that tells them what file you want and how you want it sent to
you The most important command is send which tells the computer you
want it to send you a particular file
 First though youll need to know where the mail server stores
that file because you have to tell it which directory or sub
directory its in There are a couple of ways to do this You can
send an email message to the archiveserver that consists of one
line

 index

 The server will then send you a directory listing of its main or
root directory Youll then have to send a second message to the
archive server with one line

 index directorysubdirectory

where that is the directory or directory path for which you want a
listing An alternative is to send an email message to our old
friend archie which should send you back the files exact location on
the archiveserver along with similar listings for all the other
sites that may have the file however
 Once you have the file name and its directory path compose a
message to the archive server like this

 send directorysubdirectoryfile

 Send off the message and anywhere from a few minutes to a couple
of days later youll find a new message in your mailbox a copy of the
file you requested The exact time it will take a file to get to you
depends on a variety of factors including how many requests are in line
before yours mail servers can only process so many requests at a time
and the state of the connections between the server and you
 Seems simple enough It gets a little more complicated when you
request a program rather than a document Programs or other files that
contain unusual characters or lines longer than 130 characters graphics
files for example require special processing by both the mail server
to ensure they are transmitted via email Then youll have to run them
through at least one converter program to put them in a form you can
actually use To ensure that a program or other nonmailable file
actually gets to you include another line in your email message to the
server

 encoder

This converts the file into an encoded form To decode it youll
first have to transfer the file message into a file in your home
directory
 One further complication comes when you request a particularly
long file Many Net sites can only handle so much mail at a time To
make sure you get the entire file tell the mail server to break it up
into smaller pieces with another line in your email request like
this

 size 100000

 This gives the mail server the maximum size in bytes of each
file segment This particular size is good for UUCP sites Internet
and Bitnet sites can generally go up to 300000 When you get all of
these files in mail transfer them to your home directory Exit mail
and call up each file in your host systems text processor and delete
each ones entire header and footer or signature at the end When
done with this at your host systems command line type

 cat file1 file2  bigfile

where file1 is the first file file2 the second file and so on The 
tells your host system to combine them into a new megafile called
bigfile or whatever you want to call it After you save the file to
your home directory see section 92 above you can then run uudecode
tar etc One word of caution though if the file you want is long
enough that it has to be broken into pieces think of how much time its
going to take you to download the whole thing  especially if youre
using a 2400baud modem
 There are a number of other mail servers To get a list send an
email message to mailserverrtfmmitedu

send usenetcompsourceswantedHow_to_find_sources_READ_THIS_BEFORE_POSTING

 Youll have to spell it exactly as listed above Some mail
servers use different software which will require slightly different
commands than the ones listed here In general if you send a message
to a mail server that says only

 help

you should get back a file detailing all of its commands
 But what if the file you want is not on one of these mail
servers Thats where ftpmail comes in Run by Digital Equipment
Corp in California this service can connect to almost any ftp site
in the world get the file you want and then mail it to you Using it
is fairly simple  you send an email message to ftpmail that
includes a series of commands telling the system where to find the
file you want and how to format it to mail to you
 Compose an email message to

 ftpmaildecwrldeccom

 Leave the subject line blank Inside the message there are
several commands you can give The first line should be

 reply address

where address is your email address The next line should be

 connect host

where host is the system that has the file you want for example
wuarchivewustledu Other commands you should consider using are
binary required for program files compress reduces the file
size for quicker transmission and uuencode which encodes the file
so you can do something with it when it arrives The last line of
your message should be the word quit
 Lets say you want a copy of the US constitution Using archie
youve found a file called surprise constitution at the ftp site
archivecisohiostateedu in the pubfirearmspoliticsrkba
directory Youd send a message to ftpmaildecwrldeccom that looks
like this

 reply adamgworldstdcom
 connect archivecisohiostateedu
 binary
 compress
 uuencode
 get pubfirearmspoliticsrkbaconstitution
 quit

 When you get the file in your mailbox use the above procedure
for copying it to a file Run it through uudecode Then type

 uncompress filename

to make it usable
 Since this was a text file you could have changed the binary to
ascii and then eliminated the uuencode file For programs though
youll want to keep these lines One caveat with ftpmail it has become
such a popular service that it could take a week or more for your
requested files to arrive


95 THE ALL KNOWING ORACLE


 One other thing you can do through email is consult with the
Usenet Oracle You can ask the Oracle anything at all and get back an
answer whether you like the answer is another question
 First youll want to get instructions on how to address the Oracle
he or she or it is very particular about such things and likes being
addressed in august solemn and particularly sycophantic tones Start
an email message to

 oracleiuvaxcsindianaedu

 In the subject line type

 help

and hit enter You dont actually have to say anything in the message
itself  at least not yet Hit controlD to send off your request
for help Within a few hours the Oracle will mail you back detailed
instructions Its a fairly long file so before you start reading
it turn on your communications softwares logging function to save
it to your computer or save the message to a file on your host systems
home directory and then download the file After youve digested it
you can compose your question to the Oracle Mail it to the above
address only this time with a subject line that describes your
question Expect an answer within a couple of days And dont be
surprised if you also find a question in your mailbox  the Oracle
extracts payment by making seekers of knowledge answer questions as
well





Chapter 10 NEWS OF THE WORLD




101 Clarinet UPI Dave Barry and Dilbert


 Usenet newsgroups can be something of a misnomer They may be
interesting informative and educational but they are often not news
at least not the way most people would think of them But there are several
sources of news and sports on the Net
 One of the largest is Clarinet a company in Cupertino Calf that
distributes wireservice news and columns along with a news service
devoted to computers and even the Dilbert comic strip in Usenet form
 Distributed in Usenet form Clarinet stories and columns are
organized into more than 100 newsgroups in this case a truly
appropriate name some of them with an extremely narrow focus for
example clarinewsgovtaxes The general news and sports come from
United Press International the computer news from the NewsBytes
service the features from several syndicates
 Because Clarinet charges for its service not all host systems
carry its articles Those that do carry them as Usenet groups starting
with clari As with other Usenet hierarchies these are named starting
with broad area and ending with more specific categories Some of these
include business news claribiz general national and foreign news
politics and the like clarinews sports clarisports columns by
Mike Royko Miss Manners Dave Barry and others clarifeature and
NewsBytes computer and telecommunications reports clarinb Because
Clarinet started in Canada there is a separate set of claricanada
newsgroups The clarinb newsgroups are divided into specific computer
types clarinbapple for example
 Clari news groups feature stories updated around the clock There
are even a couple of bulletin newsgroups for breaking stories
clarinewsbulletin and clarinewsurgent Clarinet also sets up new
newsgroups for breaking stories that become ongoing ones such as major
natural disasters coups in large countries and the like
 Occasionally you will see stories in clari newsgroups that just
dont seem to belong there Stories about former Washington DC mayor
Marion Barry for example often wind interspersed among columns by Dave
Barry
 This happens because of the way wire services work UPI uses
threeletter codes to route its stories to the newspapers and radio
stations that make up most of its clientele and harried editors on
deadline sometimes punch in the wrong code


102 REUTERS

Chapter 9 ADVANCED EMAIL



91 THE FILES IN THE MAIL


 Email by itself is a powerful tool and by now you may be
sending email messages all over the place You might even be on a
mailing list or two But there is a lot more to email than just
sending messages If your host system does not have access to ftp
or it doesnt have access to every ftp site on the Net you can have
programs and files sent right to your mailbox And using some simple
techniques you can use email to send data files such as spreadsheets
or even whole programs to friends and colleagues around the world
 A key to both is a set of programs known as encoders and
decoders For all its basic power Net email has a big problem it
cant handle graphics characters or the control codes found in even
the simplest of computer programs Encoders however can translate
these into forms usable in email while decoders turn them back into
a form that you can actually use If you are using a Unixbased host
system chances are it already has an encoder and decoder online that
you can use These programs will also let you use programs posted in
several Usenet newsgroups such as compbinariesibmpc
 If both you and the person with whom you want to exchange files use
Unix host systems youre in luck because virtually all Unix
host systems have encoderdecoder programs online For now lets
assume thats the case First upload the file you want to send to your
friend to your host site ask your system administrator how to upload a
file to your name or home directory if you dont already know how
Then type

 uuencode file file  fileuu

and hit enter File is the name of the file you want to prepare for
mailing and yes you have to type the name twice The  is a Unix
command that tells the system to call the encoded file fileuu
you could actually call it anything you want
 Now to get it into a mail message The quick and dirty way is to
type

 mail friend

where friend is your friends address At the subject line type
the name of the enclosed file When you get the blank line type

 r fileuu

or whatever you called the file and hit enter on some systems the 
may not work if so ask your system administrator what to use This
inserts the file into your mail message Hit controlD and your file
is on its way
 On the other end when your friend goes into her mailbox she
should transfer it to her home directory Then she should type

 uudecode filename

and hit enter This creates a new file in her name directory with
whatever name you originally gave it She can then download it to her
own computer Before she can actually use it though shell have to
open it up with a text processor and delete the mail header that has
been stamped on it If you use a mailer program that automatically
appends a signature tell her about that so she can delete that as
well


92 RECEIVING FILES


 If somebody sends you a file through the mail youll have to go
through a couple of steps to get it into a form you can actually use If
you are using the simple mail program go into mail and type

 w  filename

where  is the number of the message you want to transfer and
filename is what you want to call the resulting file In pine call
up the message and hit your O key and then E Youll then be asked
for a file name In elm call up the message and hit your S key
Youll get something that looks like this

 filerequest

 Type a new file name and hit enter if you hit enter without
typing a file name the message will be saved to another mail folder
not your home directory
 In all three cases exit the mail program to return to your host
systems command line Because the file has been encoded for mail
delivery you now have to run a decoder At the command line type

 uudecode filename

where filename is the file you created while in mail Uudecode will
create a new uncompressed binary file In some cases you may have to
run it through some other programs for example if it is in tar form
but generally it should now be ready for you to download to your own
computer on which you might then have to run a decompressor program
such as PKXZIP


93 SENDING FILES TO NONINTERNET SITES


 What if your friend only connects with a nonUnix system such as
CompuServe or MCIMail There are programs available for MSDOS Apple
and Amiga computers that will encode and decode files Of course since
you cant send one of these programs to your friend via email how would
she unencode it youll have to mail the oldfashioned way or give
her a diskette with the program on it first Then she can get the file
by email and go through the above process only on her own computer to
get a usable file Remember to give her an encoder program as well if
she wants to send you files in return
 For MSDOS machines youll want to get uunecodecom and
uudecodecom Both can be found through anonymous ftp at
wuarchivewustledu in the mirrorsmsdosstarter directory The MS
DOS version is as easy to use as the Unix one Just type

 uudecode filenameext

and hit enter
 Mac users should get a program called uutool which can be found
in the infomacutil directory on sumexaimstanfordedu
 Think twice before sending somebody a giant file Although large
sites connected directly to the Internet can probably handle megafiles
many smaller systems cannot Some commercial systems such as CompuServe
and MCIMail limit the size of mail messages their users can receive
Fidonet doesnt even allow encoded messages In general a file size of
30000 or so bytes is a safe upper limit for nonInternet systems


94 GETTING FTP FILES VIA EMAIL


 To help people without ftp access a number of ftp sites have set up
mail servers also known as archive servers that allow you to get files
via email You send a request to one of these machines and they send
back the file you want As with ftp youll be able to find everything
from historical documents to software but please note that if you do
have access to ftp that method is always quicker and ties up fewer
resources than using email
 Some interesting or useful mail servers include
 mailserverrtfmmitedu Files of frequently asked questions
related to Usenet statebystate lists of US representatives and
Senators and their addresses and office phone numbers
 archiveserverefforg Information about the Electronic Frontier
Foundation documents about legal issues on the Net
 archiveservercswideneredu Back copies of the Computer
Underground Digest and every possible fact you could want to know about
The Simpsons
 netlibuunetuunet Programs for many types of personal computers
archives of past postings from many Usenet newsgroups
 archiveserveramesarcnasagov Spacerelated text and graphics
GIFformat files
 servicenicddnmil Detailed information about Internet
 Most mail servers work pretty much the same  you send an email
message that tells them what file you want and how you want it sent to
you The most important command is send which tells the computer you
want it to send you a particular file
 First though youll need to know where the mail server stores
that file because you have to tell it which directory or sub
directory its in There are a couple of ways to do this You can
send an email message to the archiveserver that consists of one
line

 index

 The server will then send you a directory listing of its main or
root directory Youll then have to send a second message to the
archive server with one line

 index directorysubdirectory

where directorysubdirectory is the directory path for which you want a
listing An alternative is to send an email message to our old friend
archie which should send you back the files exact location on the
archiveserver along with similar listings for all the other sites that
may have the file however
 Once you have the file name and its directory path compose a
message to the archive server like this

 send directorysubdirectoryfile

 Send off the message and anywhere from a few minutes to a couple
of days later youll find a new message in your mailbox a copy of the
file you requested The exact time it will take a file to get to you
depends on a variety of factors including how many requests are in line
before yours mail servers can only process so many requests at a time
and the state of the connections between the server and you
 Seems simple enough It gets a little more complicated when you
request a program rather than a document Programs or other files that
contain unusual characters or lines longer than 130 characters graphics
files for example require special processing by the mail server to
ensure they are transmitted via email Then youll have to run them
through at least one converter program to put them in a form you can
actually use To ensure that a program or other nonmailable file
actually gets to you include another line in your email message to the
server

 encoder

This converts the file into an encoded form To decode it youll
first have to transfer the file message into a file in your home
directory
 One further complication comes when you request a particularly
long file Many Net sites can only handle so much mail at a time To
make sure you get the entire file tell the mail server to break it up
into smaller pieces with another line in your email request like
this

 size 100000

 This gives the mail server the maximum size in bytes of each
file segment This particular size is good for UUCP sites Internet
and Bitnet sites can generally go up to 300000 When you get all of
these files in mail transfer them to your home directory Exit mail
and call up each file in your host systems text processor and delete
each ones entire header and footer or signature at the end When
done with this at your host systems command line type

 cat file1 file2  bigfile

where file1 is the first file file2 the second file and so on The 
tells your host system to combine them into a new megafile called
bigfile or whatever you want to call it After you save the file to
your home directory see section 92 above you can then run uudecode
tar etc One word of caution though if the file you want is long
enough that it has to be broken into pieces think of how much time its
going to take you to download the whole thing  especially if youre
using a 2400baud modem
 There are a number of other mail servers To get a list send an
email message to mailserverrtfmmitedu

send usenetcompsourceswantedHow_to_find_sources_READ_THIS_BEFORE_POSTING

 Youll have to spell it exactly as listed above Some mail
servers use different software which will require slightly different
commands than the ones listed here In general if you send a message
to a mail server that says only

 help

you should get back a file detailing all of its commands
 But what if the file you want is not on one of these mail
servers Thats where ftpmail comes in Run by Digital Equipment
Corp in California this service can connect to almost any ftp site
in the world get the file you want and then mail it to you Using it
is fairly simple  you send an email message to ftpmail that
includes a series of commands telling the system where to find the
file you want and how to format it to mail to you
 Compose an email message to

 ftpmaildecwrldeccom

 Leave the subject line blank Inside the message there are
several commands you can give The first line should be

 reply address

where address is your email address The next line should be

 connect host

where host is the system that has the file you want for example
wuarchivewustledu Other commands you should consider using are
binary required for program files compress reduces the file
size for quicker transmission and uuencode which encodes the file
so you can do something with it when it arrives The last line of
your message should be the word quit
 Lets say you want a copy of the US constitution Using archie
youve found a file called surprise constitution at the ftp site
archivecisohiostateedu in the pubfirearmspoliticsrkba
directory Youd send a message to ftpmaildecwrldeccom that looks
like this

 reply adamgworldstdcom
 connect archivecisohiostateedu
 binary
 compress
 uuencode
 get pubfirearmspoliticsrkbaconstitution
 quit

 When you get the file in your mailbox use the above procedure
for copying it to a file Run it through uudecode Then type

 uncompress filename

to make it usable
 Since this was a text file you could have changed the binary to
ascii and then eliminated the uuencode file For programs though
youll want to keep these lines One caveat with ftpmail it has become
such a popular service that it could take a week or more for your
requested files to arrive


95 THE ALL KNOWING ORACLE


 One other thing you can do through email is consult with the
Usenet Oracle You can ask the Oracle anything at all and get back an
answer whether youll like the answer is another question
 First youll want to get instructions on how to address the Oracle
he or she or it is very particular about such things and likes being
addressed in august solemn and particularly sycophantic tones Start
an email message to

 oracleiuvaxcsindianaedu

 In the subject line type

 help

and hit enter You dont actually have to say anything in the message
itself  at least not yet Hit controlD to send off your request
for help Within a few hours the Oracle will mail you back detailed
instructions Its a fairly long file so before you start reading
it turn on your communications softwares logging function to save
it to your computer or save the message to a file on your host systems
home directory and then download the file After youve digested it
you can compose your question to the Oracle Mail it to the above
address only this time with a subject line that describes your
question Expect an answer within a couple of days And dont be
surprised if you also find a question in your mailbox  the Oracle
extracts payment by making seekers of knowledge answer questions as
well





Chapter 10 NEWS OF THE WORLD




101 Clarinet UPI Dave Barry and Dilbert


 Usenet newsgroups can be something of a misnomer They may be
interesting informative and educational but they are often not news
at least not the way most people would think of them But there are several
sources of news and sports on the Net
 One of the largest is Clarinet a company in Cupertino Calf that
distributes wireservice news and columns along with a news service
devoted to computers and even the Dilbert comic strip in Usenet form
 Distributed in Usenet form Clarinet stories and columns are
organized into more than 100 newsgroups in this case a truly
appropriate name some of them with an extremely narrow focus for
example clarinewsgovtaxes The general news and sports come from
United Press International the computer news from the NewsBytes
service the features from several syndicates
 Because Clarinet charges for its service not all host systems
carry its articles Those that do carry them as Usenet groups starting
with clari As with other Usenet hierarchies these are named starting
with broad area and ending with more specific categories Some of these
include business news claribiz general national and foreign news
politics and the like clarinews sports clarisports columns by
Mike Royko Miss Manners Dave Barry and others clarifeature and
NewsBytes computer and telecommunications reports clarinb Because
Clarinet started in Canada there is a separate set of claricanada
newsgroups The clarinb newsgroups are divided into specific computer
types clarinbapple for example
 Clari news groups feature stories updated around the clock There
are even a couple of bulletin newsgroups for breaking stories
clarinewsbulletin and clarinewsurgent Clarinet also sets up new
newsgroups for breaking stories that become ongoing ones such as major
natural disasters coups in large countries and the like
 Occasionally you will see stories in clari newsgroups that just
dont seem to belong there Stories about former Washington DC mayor
Marion Barry for example often wind interspersed among columns by Dave
Barry This happens because of the way wire services work UPI uses
threeletter codes to route its stories to the newspapers and radio
stations that make up most of its clientele and harried editors on
deadline sometimes punch in the wrong code

Chapter 11 IRC MUDs AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MORE FUN THAN THEY SOUND




 Many Net systems provide access to a series of interactive
services that let you hold live chats or play online games with
people around the world To find out if your host system offers
these you can ask your system administrator or just try them  if
nothing happens then your system does not provide them In general
if you can use telnet and ftp chances are good you can use these
services as well


111 TALK


 This is the Net equivalent of a telephone conversation and
requires that both you and the person you want to talk to have access
to this function and are online at the same time To use it type

 talk usersitename

where usersitename is the email address of the other person She will
see something like this on her screen

 talk connection requested by yournamesitename
 talk respond with talk yournamesitename

To start the conversation she should then type at her host systems
command line

 talk yournamesitename

where that is your email address Both of you will then get a top
and bottom window on your screen She will see everything you type in
one window youll see everything she types in the other To
disconnect hit controlC
 One note Publicaccess sites that use Sun computers sometimes have
trouble with the talk program If talk does not work try typing

 otalk

or

 ntalk

instead However the party at the other end will have to have the same
program online for the connection to work


112 INTERNET RELAY CHAT


 IRC is a program that lets you hold live keyboard conversations
with people around the world Its a lot like an international CB
radio  it even uses channels Type something on your computer and
its instantly echoed around the world to whoever happens to be on the
same channel with you You can join in existing public group chats or
set up your own You can even create a private channel for yourself
and as few as one or two other people And just like on a CB radio
you can give yourself a unique handle or nickname
 IRC currently links host systems in 20 different countries from
Australia to Hong Kong to Israel Unfortunately its like telnet 
either your site has it or it doesnt If your host system does have it
Just type

 irc

and hit enter Youll get something like this


 Connecting to port 6667 of server worldstdcom
 Welcome to the Internet Relay Network adamg
 Your host is worldstdcom running version 271e4

 2313 1 adamg Mail 32  type help for help






 You are now in channel 0 the null channel in which you can look
up various help files but not much else As you can see IRC takes over
your entire screen The top of the screen is where messages will
appear The last line is where you type IRC commands and messages All
IRC commands begin with a  The slash tells the computer you are about
to enter a command rather than a message To see what channels are
available type

 list

and hit enter Youll get something like this


 Channel Users Topic
 Money 1 School CAH msg SOS_AID help
 Gone 1  Gone with the wind 
 mee 1
 eclipse 1
 hiya 2
 saigon 4
 screwed 3
 z 2
 comix 1 LETS TALK BOUT COMIX

 DragonSrv 1

 Because IRC allows for a large number of channels the list might
scroll off your screen so you might want to turn on your computers
screen capture to capture the entire list Note that the channels
always have names instead of numbers Each line in the listing tells
you the channel name the number of people currently in it and whether
theres a specific topic for it To switch to a particular channel
type

 join channel

where channel is the channel name and hit enter Some public
channels actually require an invitation from somebody already on it To
request an invitation type

 who channelname

where channelname is the name of the channel and hit enter Then ask
someone with an  next to their name if you can join in Note that
whenever you enter a channel you have to include the  Choose one
with a number of users so you can see IRC in action
 If its a busy channel as soon as you join it the top of your
screen will quickly be filled with messages Each will start with a
persons IRC nickname followed by his message
 It may seem awfully confusing at first There could be two or
three conversations going on at the same time and sometimes the
messages will come in so fast youll wonder how you can read them all
 Eventually though youll get into the rhythm of the channel and
things will begin to make more sense You might even want to add your
two cents in fact dont be surprised if a message to you shows up on
your screen right away on some channels newcomers are welcomed
immediately To enter a public message simply type it on that bottom
line the computer knows its a message because you havent started the
line with a slash and hit enter
 Public messages have a users nickname in brackets like this

 tomg

 If you receive a private message from somebody his name will be
between asterisks like this

 tomg


113 IRC COMMANDS

 whatever public channels you were on although neither
 of you will be able to respond to any of the messages
 there

quit Exit IRC

signoff Exit IRC

summon Asks somebody connected to a host system with IRC to
 join you on IRC You must use the persons entire email
 address

 summon fleepofoobarcom

 know theyre already amenable to the idea otherwise you
 may wind up annoying them no end This command does not
 work on all sites

topic When youve started a new channel use this command to let
 others know what its about

 topic Amiga

 would tell people who use list that your channel is meant
 for discussing Amiga computers

who chan Shows you the email address of people on a particular
 channel

 who foo

 would show you the addresses of everybody on channel foo

 who

 by itself shows you every email address for every person
 on IRC at the time although be careful on a busy night
 you might get a list of 500 names

whois Use this to get some information about a specific IRC
 user or to see who is online

 whois nickname

 will give you the email address for the person using
 that nickname

 whois 

 will list everybody on every channel

whowas Similar to whois gives information for people who
 recently signed off IRC


114 IRC IN TIMES OF CRISIS


 IRC has become a new medium for staying on top of really big
breaking news In 1993 when Russian lawmakers barricaded themselves
inside the parliament building some enterprising Muscovites and a couple
of Americans set up a news channel on IRC to relay firstperson
accounts direct from Moscow The channel was set up to provide a
continuous loop of information much like allnews radio stations that
cycle through the days news every 20 minutes In 1994 Los Angeles
residents set up a similar channel to relay information related to the
Northridge earthquake In both cases logs of the channels were archived
somewhere on the Net for those unable to tune in live
 How would you find such channels in the future Use the list
command to scroll through the available channels If one has been set up
to discuss a particular breaking event chances are youll see a brief
description next to the channel name that will tell you thats the place
to tune


115 MUDs


 MultipleUser Dimensions or Dungeons MUDs take IRC into the
realm of fantasy MUDs are live roleplaying games in which you
enter assume a new identity and enter an alternate reality through
your keyboard As you explore this other world through a series of
simple commands such as look go and take youll run across
other users who may engage you in a friendly discussion enlist your
aid in some quest or try to kill you for no apparent reason
 Each MUD has its own personality and creator or God who was
willing to put in the long hours required to establish the particular
MUDs rules laws of nature and information databases Some MUDs
stress the social aspects of online communications  users frequently
gather online to chat and join together to build new structures or
even entire realms Others are closer to Dungeons and Dragons and
are filled with sorcerers dragons and evil people out to keep you
from completing your quest  through murder if necessary
 Many MUDs there are also related games known as MUCKs and MUSEs
require you to apply in advance through email for a character name
and password One that lets you look around first though is
HoloMuck at McGill University in Montreal The premise of this game
is that you arrive in the middle of Tanstaafl a city on the planet
Holo You have to find a place to live else you get thrown into the
homeless shelter and then you can begin exploring Magic is allowed
on this world but only outside the city limits Get bored with the
city and you can roam the rest of the world or even take a trip into
orbit of course all this takes money you can either wait for your
weekly salary or take a trip to the city casino Once you become
familiar with the city and get your own character you can even begin
erecting your own building or subway line or almost anything else

open apartments available Type apartments to see how to get to an
apartment building with open vacancies
There is a small sign on the wall here with helpful information Type look
sign to read it
The door is standing open for your return to respectable society Simply walk
out to the center
 Of course you want to join respectable society but first you
want to see what that sign says So you type

 look sign

and hit enter which brings up a list of some basic commands Then
you type

followed by enter which brings up this

You slip out the door and head southeast
Tanstaafl Center
This is the center of the beautiful town of Tanstaafl High Street runs north

and enter to get to Tanstaafl Towers the city housing complex where
you have to claim an apartment you may have to look around many will
already be occupied And now its off to explore Holo One command
youll want to keep in mind is take Periodically youll come
across items that when you take them will confer certain abilities or
powers on you If you type

 help

and enter youll get a list of files you can read to learn more about
the MUDs commands
 The say command lets you talk to other players publicly For
example

 say Hey Im here

would be broadcast to everybody else in the room with you If you
want to talk to just one particular person use whisper instead of
say

 whisper agoraHey Im here

would be heard only by agora Another way to communicate with
somebody regardless of where on the world they are is through your
pager If you suddenly see yours go off while visiting chances are
its a wizard checking to see if you need any help To read his
message type

 page

To send him a message type

 page namemessage

where name is the wizards name itll be in the original message
 Other MUDs and MUCKs may have different commands but generally
use the same basic idea of letting you navigate through relatively
simple English commands
 When you connect to a MUD choose your password as carefully as
you would one for your host system alas there are MUD crackers who
enjoy trying to break into other peoples MUD accounts And never
never use the same password as the one you use on your host system
 MUDs can prove highly addicting The jury is still out on
whether MUDding is just a game or an extension of real life with
gamelike qualities says Jennifer Smith an active MUD player who
wrote an FAQ on the subject
 She adds one caution You shouldnt do anything that you
wouldnt do in real life even if the world is a fantasy world The
important thing to remember is that its the fantasy world of possibly
hundreds of people and not just yours in particular Theres a
human being on the other side of each and every wire Always remember
that you may meet these other people some day and they may break
your nose People who treat others badly gradually build up bad
reputations and eventually receive the NO FUN Stamp of Disapproval



116 GO GO GO AND CHESS TOO

 Fancy a good game of go or chess You no longer have to head for
the nearest park with a board in hand The Internet has a couple of

117 THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN


 All is not fun and games on the Net Like any community the Net
has its share of obnoxious characters who seem to exist only to make
your life miserable youve already met some of them in chapter 4
There are people who seem to spend a bit more time on the Net than many
would find healthy It also has its criminals Clifford Stoll writes in
The Cuckoos Egg how he tracked a team of German hackers who were
breaking into US computers and selling the information they found to
the Soviets Robert Morris a Cornell University student was convicted
of unleashing a worm program that effectively disabled several thousand
computers connected to the Internet
 Of more immediate concern to the average Net user are crackers
who seek to find others passwords to break into Net systems and people
who infect programs on ftp sites with viruses
 There is a widely available program known as Crack that can
decipher user passwords composed of words that might be found in a
dictionary this is why you shouldnt use such passwords Short of
that there are the annoying types who take a special thrill in trying to
make you miserable The best advice in dealing with them is to count to
10 and then ignore them  like juveniles everywhere most of their fun
comes in seeing how upset you can get
 Meanwhile two Cornell University students pleaded guilty in 1992 to
uploading virusinfected Macintosh programs to ftp sites If you plan
to try out large amounts of software from ftp sites it might be wise to
download or buy a good antiviral program
 But can law enforcement go too far in seeking out the criminals
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in large part in
response to a series of government raids against an alleged gang of
hackers The raids resulted in the near bankruptcy of one game
company never alleged to have had anything to do with the hackers
when the government seized its computers and refused to give them
back The case against another alleged participant collapsed in court
when his attorney showed the proprietary and supposedly hacked
information he printed in an electronic newsletter was actually
available via an 800 number for about 13  from the phone company
from which that data was taken


118 FYI

 You can find discussions about IRC in the altirc newsgroup
 A Discussion on Computer Network Conferencing by Darren Reed
May 1992 provides a theoretical background on why conferencing
systems such as IRC are a Good Thing Its available through ftp at
nicddnmil in the rfc directory as rfc1324txt
 Every Friday Scott Goehring posts a new list of MUDs and related
games and their telnet addresses in the newsgroup recgamesmudannounce

Chapter 12 EDUCATION AND THE NET




121 THE NET IN THE CLASSROOM


 If youre a teacher youve probably already begun to see the
potential the Net has for use in the class Usenet ftp and telnet have
tremendous educational potential from keeping up with world events to
arranging international science experiments
 Because the Net now reaches so many countries and often stays
online even when the phones go down you and your students can tune
in to firsthand accounts during international conflicts Look at
your systems list of Usenet socculture groups to see if there is one
about the country or region youre interested in Even in peacetime
these newsgroups can be great places to find people from countries you
might be studying
 The biggest problem may be getting accounts for your students if
youre not lucky enough to live within the local calling area of a
FreeNet system Many colleges and universities however are willing
to discuss providing accounts for secondary students at little or no
cost Several states including California and Texas have Internet
linked networks for teachers and students

122 SOME SPECIFIC RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS

 In addition there are a number of resources on the Internet aimed
specifically at elementary and secondary students and teachers You
can use these to set up science experiments with classes in another
country learn how to use computers in the classroom or keep up with the
latest advances in teaching everything from physics to physical
education
 Among them

AskERIC Run by the Educational Resource and Information Center
 AskERIC provides a way for educators librarians and
 others interested in K12 education to get more
 information about virtually everything The center
 maintains an email address askericericirsyredu for
 questions and promises answers within 48 hours It also
 maintains a gopher site that contains digests of
 questions and answers lesson plans in a variety of
 fields and other educationally related information The
 gopher address is ericirsyredu

HealthEd A mailing list for health educators Send a request to
 healthedrequeststjhmcfidonetorg

K12Net Begun on the Fidonet hobbyist network K12Net is now also
 carried on many Usenet systems and provides a host of
 interesting and valuable services These include
 international chat for students foreignlanguage
 discussions for example there are French and German
 only conference where American students can practice
 those languages with students from Quebec and German
 There are also conferences aimed at teachers of specific
 subjects from physical education to physics The K12
 network still has limited distribution so ask your
 system administrator if your system carries it

Kidsphere Kidsphere is a mailing list for elementary and secondary
 teachers who use it to arrange joint projects and
 discuss educational telecommunications You will find
 news of new software lists of sites from which you can
 get computergraphics pictures from various NASA
 satellites and probes and other news of interest to
 modemusing teachers
 To subscribe send a request by email to kidsphere
 requestvmscispittedu or joinkidsvmscispittedu and
 you will start receiving messages within a couple of
 days
 To contribute to the discussion send messages to
 kidspherevmscispittedu
 KIDS is a spinoff of KIDSPHERE just for students
 who want to contact students To subscribe send a
 request to joinkidsvmscispittedu as above To
 contribute send messages to kidsvmscistpittedu

Knoxville Using the newspaper in the electronic classroom This
News gopher site lets students and teachers connect to
Sentinel the newspaper and provides resources for them derived
Online from the newsroom Use gopher to connect to
 gopheropuporg

MicroMUSE This is an online futuristic city built entirely by
 participants see chapter 11 for information on MUSEs
 and MUDs in general Hundreds of students from all
 over have participated in this educational exercise
 coordinated by MIT Telnet to michaelaimitedu
 Log on as guest and then follow the prompts for more
 information

NASA Spacelink This system run by NASA in Huntsville Ala
 provides all sorts of reports and data about NASA its
 history and its various missions past and present
 Telnet spacelinkmsfcnasagov or 12815813250
 When you connect youll be given an overview of the
 system and asked to register The system maintains a
 large file library of GIFformat space graphics but note
 that you cant download these through telnet If you want
 to you have to dial the system directly at 205 895
 0028 Many can be obtained through ftp from
 amesarcnasagov however

Newton Run by the Argonne National Laboratory it offers
 conferences for teachers and students including one
 called Ask a Scientist

 Telnet newtondepanlgov
 Log in as cocotext

 Youll be asked to provide your name and address When
 you get the main menu hit 4 for the various conferences
 The Ask a Scientist category lets you ask questions of
 scientists in fields from biology to earth science
 Other categories let you discuss teaching sports and
 computer networks

OERI The US Department of Educations Office of Educational
 Resources and Improvement runs a gopher system that
 provides numerous educational resources information and
 statistics for teachers Use gopher to connect to

 gopheredgov

Spacemet Forum If your system doesnt carry the K12 conferences but
 does provide you with telnet you can reach the
 conferences through SpaceMet Forum a bulletinboard
 system aimed at teachers and students that is run by the
 physics and astronomy department at the University of
 Massachusetts at Amherst

 Telnet spacemetphastumassedu

 When you connect hit escape once after which youll be
 asked to log on Like K12Net SpaceMet Forum began as a
 Fidonet system but has since grown much larger Mort
 and Helen Sternheim professors at the university
 started SpaceMet as a oneline bulletinboard system
 several years ago to help bolster middleschool science
 education in nearby towns
 In addition to the K12 conferences SpaceMet carries
 numerous educationally oriented conferences It also has
 a large file library of interest to educators and
 students but be aware that getting files to your site
 could be difficult and maybe even impossible Unlike
 most other Internet sites Spacemet does not use an ftp
 interface The Sternheims say ZMODEM sometimes works over
 the network but dont count on it


123 USENET AND BITNET IN THE CLASSROOM

 There are numerous Usenet newsgroups of potential interest to
teachers and students
 As you might expect many are of a scientific bent You can find
these by typing l sci in rn or using nngrep sci for nn There are now
close to 40 with subjects ranging from archaeology to economics the
dismal science remember to astronomy to nanotechnology the
construction of microscopically small machines
 One thing students will quickly learn from many of these groups
science is not just dull boring facts Science is argument and standing
your ground and making your case The Usenet sci groups encourage
critical thinking
 Beyond science socialstudies and history classes can keep busy
learning about other countries through the socculture newsgroups
 Most of these newsgroups originated as ways for expatriates of a
given country to keep in touch with their homeland and its culture In
times of crisis however these groups often become places to
disseminate information from or into the country and to discuss what is
happening From Afghanistan to Yugoslavia close to 50 countries are
now represented on Usenet To see which groups are available use l
socculture in rn or nngrep socculture for nn
 Several talk newsgroups provide additional topical discussions
but teachers should screen them first before recommending them to
students They range from talkabortion and talkpoliticsguns to
talkpoliticsspace and talkenvironment
 One caveat Teachers might want to peruse particular newsgroups
before setting their students loose in them Some have higher levels of
flaming and blather than others
 There are also a number of Bitnet discussion groups of potential
interest to students and teachers See Chapter 5 for information on
finding and subscribing to Bitnet discussion groups Some with an
educational orientation include

biopil ksuvmbitnet Secondary biology education
chemedl uwfbitnet Chemistry education
dtsl iubvmbitnet The Dead Teachers Society list
physl uwfbitnet Discussions for physics teachers
physhare psuvmbitnet Where physics teachers share resources
scimathl psuvmbitnet Science and math education

 To get a list of ftp sites that carry astronomical images in the GIF
graphics format use ftp to connect to nicfunetfi Switch to the
pubastrogeneral directory and get the file astroftptxt Among the
sites listed is amesarcnasagov which carries images taken by the
Voyager and Galileo probes among other pictures





CHAPTER 13 Business on the Net



131 SETTING UP SHOP


 Back in olden days oh before 1990 or so there were no markets in
the virtual community  if you wanted to buy a book you still had to
jump in your car and drive to the nearest bookstore
 This was because in those days the Net consisted mainly of a series
of governmentfunded networks on which explicit commercial activity was
forbidden Today much of the Net is run by private companies which
generally have no such restrictions and a number of companies have begun
experimenting with online shops or other services Many of these shops
are run by booksellers while the services range from delivery of indexed
copies of federal documents to an online newsstand that hopes to entice
you to subscribe to any of several publications of the printed on paper
variety A number of companies also use Usenet newsgroups in the biz
hierarchy to distribute press releases and product information
 Still commercial activity on the remains far below that found on
other networks such as CompuServe with its Electronic Mall or Prodigy
with its advertisements on almost every screen In part thats because
of the newness and complexity of the Internet as a commercial medium In
part however that is because of security concerns Companies worry
about such issues as crackers getting into their system over the network
and many people do not like the idea of sending a creditcard number via
the Internet an email message could be routed through several sites to
get to its destination These concerns could disappear as Net users
turn to such means as message encryption and digital signatures In the
meantime however businesses on the Net can still consider themselves
something of Internet pioneers
 A couple of publicaccess sites and a regional network have set up
marketplaces for online businesses
 The World in Brookline Mass currently rents space to several
bookstores and computerprogramming firms as well as an adult toy
shop To browse their offerings use gopher to connect to

 worldstdcom

At the main menu select Shops on the World
 Msen in Ann Arbor provides its Msen Marketplace where youll find
a travel agency and an Online Career Center offering helpwanted ads
from across the country Msen also provides an Internet Business
Pages an online directory of companies seeking to reach the Internet
community You can reach Msen through gopher at

 gophermsencom

At the main menu select Msen Marketplace
 The Nova Scotia Technology Network runs a Cybermarket on its
gopher service at

There youll find an online bookstore that lets you order books through
email to which youll have to trust your creditcard number and a
similar virtual record store Both let you search their wares by
keyword or by browsing through catalogs

Chapter 14 CONCLUSION  THE END


 The revolution is just beginning New communications systems and
digital technologies have already meant dramatic changes in the way we
live Think of what is already routine that would have been considered
impossible just ten years ago You can browse through the holdings of
your local library  or of libraries halfway around the world  do your
banking and see if your neighbor has gone bankrupt all through a
computer and modem
 Imploding costs coupled with exploding power are bringing ever
more powerful computer and digital systems to ever growing numbers of
people The Net with its rapidly expanding collection of databases
and other information sources is no longer limited to the
industrialized nations of the West today the web extends from Siberia
to Zimbabwe The cost of computers and modems used to plug into the Net
meanwhile continue to plummet making them ever more affordable
 Cyberspace has become a vital part of millions of peoples daily
lives People form relationships online they fall in love they get
married all because of initial contacts in cyberspace that ephemeral
place that transcends national and state boundaries Business
deals are transacted entirely in ASCII Political and social
movements begin online coordinated by people who could be thousands
of miles apart
 Yet this is only the beginning
 We live in an age of communication yet the various media we use
to talk to one another remain largely separate systems One day
however your telephone TV fax machine and personal computer will be
replaced by a single information processor linked to the worldwide
Net by strands of optical fiber
 Beyond databases and file libraries power will be at your
fingertips Linked to thousands even millions of likeminded people
youll be able to participate in social and political movements across
the country and around the world
 How does this happen In part it will come about through new
technologies Highdefinition television will require the development
of inexpensive computers that can process as much information as
todays workstations Telephone and cable companies will cooperate or
in some cases compete to bring those fiberoptic cables into your home
 The Clinton administration arguably the first led by people who
know how to use not only computer networks but computers is pushing for
creation of a series of information superhighways comparable in scope
to the Interstate highway system of the 1950s one of whose champions in
the Senate has a son elected vice president in 1992
 Right now we are in the network equivalent of the early 1950s
just before the creation of that massive highway network Sure there are
plenty of interesting things out there but you have to meander along
twolane roads and have a good map to get to them
 Creation of this new Net will require more than just highspeed
channels and routing equipment it will require a new communications
paradigm the Net as information utility The Net remains a somewhat
complicated and mysterious place To get something out of the Net today
you have to spend a fair amount of time with a Net veteran or a manual
like this You have to learn such arcana as the vagaries of the Unix cd
command
 Contrast this with the telephone which now also provides access to
large amounts of information through push buttons or a computer network
such as Prodigy which one navigates through simple commands and mouse
clicks
 Internet system administrators have begun to realize that not all
people want to learn the intricacies of Unix and that that fact does
not make them bad people We are already seeing the development of
simple interfaces that will put the Nets power to use by millions of
people You can already see their influence in the menus of gophers and
the WorldWide Web which require no complex computing skills but which
open the gates to thousands of information resources Mail programs and
text editors such as pico and pine promise much of the power of older
programs such as emacs at a fraction of the complexity
 Some software engineers are taking this even further by creating
graphical interfaces that will let somebody navigate the Internet just by
clicking on the screen with a mouse or by calling up an easy text editor
sort of the way one can now navigate a Macintosh computer  or a
commercial online service such as Prodigy
 Then there are the Internet services themselves
 For every database now available through the Internet there are
probably three or four that are not Government agencies are only
now beginning to connect their storehouses of information to the
Net Several commercial vendors from database services to booksellers
have made their services available through the Net
 Few people now use one of the Nets more interesting
applications A standard known as MIME lets one send audio and
graphics files in a message Imagine opening your email one day to hear
your granddaughters first words or a photo of your friends new
house Eventually this standard could allow for distribution of even
small video displays over the Net
 All of this will require vast new amounts of Net power to handle
both the millions of new people who will jump onto the Net and the new
applications they want Replicating a moving image on a computer screen
alone takes a phenomenal amount of computer bits and computing power to
arrange them
 All of this combines into a National Information Infrastructure able
to move billions of bits of information in one second  the kind of
power needed to hook information hoses into every business and house
 As these superhighways grow so will the on ramps for a high
speed road does you little good if you cant get to it The costs of
modems seem to fall as fast as those of computers Highspeed modems
9600 baud and up are becoming increasingly affordable At 9600 baud
you can download a satellite weather image of North America in less than
two minutes a file that with a slower modem could take up to 20
minutes to download Eventually homes could be connected directly to a
national digital network Most longdistance phone traffic is already
carried in digital form through highvolume optical fibers Phone
companies are ever so slowly working to extend these fibers the final
mile to the home The Electronic Frontier Foundation is working to
ensure these links are affordable
 Beyond the technical questions are increasingly thorny social
political and economic issues Who is to have access to these
services and at what cost If we live in an information age are we
laying the seeds for a new information under class unable to compete
with those fortunate enough to have the money and skills needed to
manipulate new communications channels Who in fact decides who has
access to what As more companies realize the potential profits to be
made in the new information infrastructure what happens to such
systems as Usenet possibly the worlds first successful anarchistic
system where everybody can say whatever they want
 What are the laws of the electronic frontier When national and
state boundaries lose their meaning in cyberspace the question might
even be WHO is the law What if a practice that is legal in one
country is committed in another country where it is illegal over a
computer network that crosses through a third country Who goes after
computer crackers
 What role will you play in the revolution






Appendix A THE LINGO

 Like any community the Net has developed its own language
What follows is a glossary of some of the more common phrases youll
likely run into But its only a small subset of netspeak You an find
a more complete listing in The New Hackers Dictionary compiled by
Eric Raymond MIT Press Raymonds work is based on an online reference
known as The Jargon File which you can get through anonymous ftp from
ftpgnumitaimit as jarg300txtgz in the pubgnu directory see
chapter 7 for information on how to uncompress a gz file

ASCII Has two meanings ASCII is a universal computer code
 for English letters and characters Computers store
 all information as binary numbers In ASCII the
 letter A is stored as 01000001 whether the computer
 is made by IBM Apple or Commodore ASCII also refers
 to a method or protocol for copying files from one
 computer to another over a network in which neither
 computer checks for any errors that might have been
 caused by static or other problems

ANSI Computers use several different methods for deciding
 how to put information on your screen and how your
 keyboard interacts with the screen ANSI is one of
 these terminal emulation methods Although most
 popular on PCbased bulletinboard systems it can also
 be found on some Net sites To use it properly you
 will first have to turn it on or enable it in your
 communications software


ARPANet A predecessor of the Internet Started in 1969 with
 funds from the Defense Departments Advanced Projects
 Research Agency

backbone A highspeed network that connects several powerful
 computers In the US the backbone of the Internet is
 often considered the NSFNet a government funded link
 between a handful of supercomputer sites across the
 country

Baud The speed at which modems transfer data One baud is
 roughly equal to one bit per second It takes eight
 bits to make up one letter or character Modems rarely
 transfer data at exactly the same speed as their listed
 baud rate because of static or computer problems More
 expensive modems use systems such as Microcom Network
 Protocol MNP which can correct for these errors or
 which compress data to speed up transmission

BITNet Another academically oriented international computer
 network which uses a different set of computer
 instructions to move data It is easily accessible to
 Internet users through email and provides a large
 number of conferences and databases Its name comes from
 Because Its Time 

Bounce What your email does when it cannot get to its
 recipient  it bounces back to you  unless it goes
 off into the ether never to be found again

Command line On Unix host systems this is where you tell the
 machine what you want it to do by entering commands

Communications A program that tells a modem how to work
software

Daemon An otherwise harmless Unix program that normally works
 out of sight of the user On the Internet youll most
 likely encounter it only when your email is not
 delivered to your recipient  youll get back your
 original message plus an ugly message from a mailer
 daemon

Distribution A way to limit where your Usenet postings go Handy for
 such things as for sale messages or discussions of
 regional politics

Domain The last part of an Internet address such as newscom

Dot When you want to impress the net veterans you meet at
 parties say dot instead of period for example My
 address is john at site dot domain dot com

Dot file A file on a Unix publicaccess system
 that alters the way you or your messages interact with
 that system For example your login file contains
 various parameters for such things as the text editor you
 get when you send a message When you do an ls command
 these files do not appear in the directory listing do ls
 a to list them

Down When a publicaccess site runs into technical trouble
 and you can no longer gain access to it its down

Download Copy a file from a host system to your computer There
 are several different methods or protocols for
 downloading files most of which periodically check the
 file as it is being copied to ensure no information is
 inadvertently destroyed or damaged during the process
 Some such as XMODEM only let you download one file at
 a time Others such as batchYMODEM and ZMODEM let
 you type in the names of several files at once which
 are then automatically downloaded

EMACS A standard Unix text editor preferred by Unix types
 that beginners tend to hate

Email Electronic mail  a way to send a private message to
 somebody else on the Net Used as both noun and verb

Emoticon See smiley

F2F Face to Face When you actually meet those people you
 been corresponding withflaming

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks
eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks

EBooks posted prior to November 2003 with eBook numbers BELOW 10000
are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year

httpwwwibiblioorggutenbergetext06

 Or etext 05 04 03 02 01 00 99
 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 92 91 or 90

EBooks posted since November 2003 with etext numbers OVER 10000 are
filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is
identical to the filename The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at

httpwwwgutenbergorg102310234

or filename 24689 would be found at
httpwwwgutenbergorg246824689
