When Senator Al Gore was evangelizing support for his visionary
National Research and Education Network bill he often pointed to
the many benefits of a highspeed multilane multilevel data
superhighway Some of these included

 collaborating research teams physically distant from each other
working on shared projects via high speed computer networks
Some of these grand challenges might model global environmental
change or new therapeutic drug research or the design of a new
airplane for inexpensive consumer air travel

 a scientist or engineer might design a product which could be
instantly communicated to a manufacturing plant whose robotic
machine could turn the drawingboard product into reality One example
of this is the capability to digitally measure a new recruit for an
army uniform transmit the information to a clothing manufacturer
and take delivery of a customtailored uniform the next day

 access to digital libraries of information both textual and graphic
Besides hundreds of online public access catalogs and full text
documents color illustrations of photographic quality full motion
videos and digital audio will also be available over the network

In his many articles and speeches touting the bill Gore often used
an example of a little girl living in a rural area at work on a school
project Was she informationpoor due to her physical location far
from the resources of large cities No the National Research and
Education Network would give her the capability to dial into the
Library of Congress to collect information on dinosaurs

Now that the NREN bill has been signed into law 1291 and
committees are being formed and policies are being made Im still
thinking about that little girl and her parents for that matter In
fact Ive got some Grand Questions to pose


1 How will we get access

The Internet has been called the Interim NREN since its what we
have in place now

Im wondering how the family is going to get to the Internet dial tone
let alone the NREN especially since they live in a rural area
The information superhighway may be miles from their home and
it may be an expensive longdistance call to the entrance ramp

Or the superhighway may run right through their front yard but
they cant make use of it because they have no computer no modem
and no phone line to make the connection What good is a superhighway
if all youve got is a tricycle


2 What will they be able to gain access to
 and will their privacy be protected

Beyond the infrastructure issues Im concerned about what kind of
things will be available for them once they do get connected
how the resources will be arranged and how they will learn to use
these tools to advantage Beyond that how authoritative is the
information in the digital collection and how do we know for sure
it came from a legitimate source How confidential will their
information searches be and how will it be safeguarded


3 Who will get access

Im concerned that even if the infrastructure and resource problems
are resolved that little girl still wont be allowed access because a
lot of folks dont think the Internet is a safe place for
unaccompanied minors


4 Does the family have any electronic rights
 Electronic responsibilities
 Are dinosaurs and a gradeschool project too trivial for NREN

Some people think the NREN should be reserved for scientists
working on Grand Challenges not ordinary ones Who will
decide what constitutes acceptable use


5 What is the future of the local public library

Worse yet Im worried that the reason they are phoning the Library
of Congress in the first place is that their local public library has
shut its doors sold off the book stock and dismissed the librarian
What can public libraries do to avoid that future

Brief Background The Internet Today

Computers all over the world are linked by high speed
telecommunications lines On the other side of their
screens are people of all races and nationalities who
are able to exchange ideas quickly through this network

This brain to brain interface brings both delight and despair as
evidenced by the following True Tales from the Internet

 Children all over the world participate in class collaborations
sharing holiday customs local food prices proverbs acid rain
measurements and surveys such as a recent one from a fifth
grade class in Argentina who wanted to know among other things
Can you wear jeans to school

 During the Soviet coup in the summer of 1991 hundreds read
eyewitness accounts of developments posted to the net by computer
users in Moscow and other Soviet cities with network connectivity
A literal hush fell over this side of the network after a plea came
across from the Soviet side We appreciate your messages of
encouragement and offers of help it said but please save the
bandwidth for our outgoing reports

 Proliferation of discussion groups on the Internet means one can
find a niche to discuss everything from cats to Camelot from
library administration to lovers of mysteries from Monty Python
to Medieval History

 Predictably Elvis has been sighted on the Internet

Besides electronic mail full text resources may be downloaded
from many Internet host computers Some of these are religious
materials such as the Bible and the Koran others are the complete
works of Shakespeare Peter Pan and Far From the Madding Crowd

Searchable resources include lyrics from popular songs chord
tablature for guitar recipes news articles government information
Supreme Court Opinions census data current and historical weather
information dictionaries thesauri the CIA World Fact Book
and much more

Hundreds of library OPACS may be searched and those with
accounts set up at CARL may use UnCover to find articles of
interest which then may be faxed on demand

The richness of the Internet changes on a daily basis as more data
resources computer resources and human resources join those
already active on the net

But back to that little girl

How will she get access

Shell need a plain old telephone line a modem a computer and
some communications software Will her family be able to afford it
If not will she be able to dial in from her school Her Post Office
The local feed store A kiosk at KMart

At the American Library Associations 1992 convention in San
Francisco Gloria Steinem said the public library is the last refuge
of those without modems Im sure she meant that the library will
act as information provider for those unable to get their
information using a home computers telecommunications
connections But it could be taken another way Couldnt the public
library act as electronic information access centers providing public
modems and telecommunications alongside the books and videos

Why the Public Library is a good place for NREN access

The public library is an institution based on longstanding beliefs in
intellectual freedom and the individuals right to know Lets revisit
ALAs LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS Adopted June 18 1948 amended February
2 1961 and January 23 1980 by the ALA Council

The American Library Association affirms that all libraries are
forums for information and ideas and that the following basic
policies should guide their services

 1 Books and other library resources should be provided for the
interest information and enlightenment of all people of the
community the library serves Materials should not be excluded
because of the origin background or views of those contributing to
their creation

No problem here The Internets resources are as diverse as their
creators from nations all over the world Every community can
find something of interest on the Internet

 2 Libraries should provide materials and information
presenting all points of view on current and historical issues
Materials should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan
or doctrinal disapproval

 3 Libraries should challenge censorship in the fulfillment of
their responsibility to provide information and enlightenment

 4 Libraries should cooperate with all persons and groups
concerned with resisting abridgment of free expression and free
access to ideas

Again global electronic communication allows discussion and
debate in an instant electronic forum There is no better
reality check than this

 5 A persons right to use a library should not be denied or
abridged because of origin age background or views

In a public library the little girl wont be barred from using the
Internet because of her age The ALA interpretation of the above
right states
Librarians and governing bodies should not resort to age
restrictions on access to library resources in an effort to avoid actual
or anticipated objections from parents or anyone else The mission
goals and objectives of libraries do not authorize librarians or
governing bodies to assume abrogate or overrule the rights and
responsibilities of parents or legal guardians Librarians and
governing bodies should maintain that parents  and only parents
 have the right and the responsibility to restrict the access
of their children  and only their children  to library resources
Parents or legal guardians who do not want their children to have
access to certain library services materials or facilities should so
advise their children Librarians and governing bodies cannot
assume the role of parents or the functions of parental authority in
the private relationship between parent and child Librarians and
governing bodies have a public and professional obligation to
provide equal access to all library resources for all library users

 6 Libraries which make exhibit spaces and meeting rooms
available to the public they serve should make such facilities
available on an equitable basis regardless of the beliefs or
affiliations of individuals or groups requesting their use

The Internet provides the equivalent of electronic meeting rooms
and virtual exhibit spaces Public libraries will offer access to all
comers regardless of their status

Further as part of the Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights
this statement appears
The US Supreme Court has recognized that the right to receive
ideas follows ineluctably from the senders First Amendment right
to send them    More importantly the right to receive ideas is a
necessary predicate to the recipients meaningful exercise of his
own rights such as speech press and political freedom Board of
Education Island Trees Union Free School District No 26 v Pico
457 US 853 86667 1982 plurality opinion

Clearly reception and sending of ideas is a First Amendment issue
Oral written and electronic speech must be equally protected so
that democracy may flourish

Public libraries also provide free services though in fact the costs
are just deferred Taxes state aid derived from taxes federal aid
derived from taxes and private funds all pay for the free services
at public libraries Public libraries may be thought of as
Information Management Organizations IMOs similar to Health
Management Organizations where patronspatients contribute
before they need informationhealth care so that when they do
need it librariansdoctors are available to render aid

Why NREN in the Public Library is a bad idea

On the surface the public library looks like an excellent place to
drop InternetNREN connectivity Libraries are veritable temples
of learning intellectual freedom and confidentiality

However most public libraries lack what computer experts call
infrastructure If there are computers they may be out of date Staff
may not have had time to learn to operate them and the computers
may literally be collecting dust

There may be no modems no phone line to share no staff with
time to learn about the Internet and its many resources Money to
update equipment hire staff and buy training is out of the
question Public libraries face slashed budgets staff layoffs
reduced hours and cutbacks in services

Many of these drawbacks are noted in the recent study by Dr
Charles R McClure called Public Libraries and the
InternetNREN New Challenges New Opportunities

Public librarians were surveyed about their attitudes toward NREN
in interviews and focus groups According to the study public
librarians thought that the public had a right to the Internet and
its availability in their libraries would provide a safety net for the
electronicpoor

On the other hand they felt that they could not commit resources to
this initiative until they knew better what the costs were and the
benefits might be They longed for someone else to create a pilot
project to demonstrate the Internets usefulness or lack thereof
for public library users

The study describes several scenarios for public libraries as the
NREN evolves Some may simply choose to ignore the sweeping
technological changes in information transfer They may continue
to exist by purveying highdemand items and traditional services
but they may find it increasingly difficult to maintain funding
levels as the rest of the world looks elsewhere for their information
and reference needs The public library may find itself servicing
only the information disenfranchised while the rest of the
community finds and pays for other solutions

 As the study explains

While embracing and exploiting networked information and services
successfully transitioned libraries also maintain high visibility
and high demand traditional services But resources will be reallocated
from collections and lessvisible services to support their involvement
in the network All services will be more clientcentered and demandbased
and the library will consciously seek opportunities to deliver new types
of information resources and services electronically

In this scenario the public library will develop and mount services
over the NREN provide for public access to the NREN and will
compete successfully against other information providers In its
networked role the library can serve as a central point of contact as
an electronic navigator and intermediary in linking individuals to
electronic information resources regardless of type or physical
location The public library in this second scenario will define a
future for itself in the NREN and develop a strategic plan to insure
its successful participation as an information provider in the
networked environment


What Should Happen

Senator Gore has proposed what has been variously called Son of
NREN or Gore II which should help address many of these
infrastructure problems

Unfortunately the Bill was not passed and the closing of the last
Congress There is hope however that it will be reintroduced this
Spring

Specifically Gores bill would have ensured that the technology
developed by the HighPerformance Computing Act of 1991 is
applied widely in K12 education libraries health care and
industry particularly manufacturing It would have authorized a
total of 115 billion over the next five years

According to a press release from Senator Gores office

The Information Infrastructure and Technology Act charges the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy OSTP with
coordinating efforts to develop applications for highperformance
computing networking and assigns specific responsibilities to the
National Science Foundation the National Aeronautics and Space
Agency the National Institute of Standards and Technology and
the National Institutes of Health It would expand the role of
OSTP in overseeing federal efforts to disseminate scientific and
technical information

The bill provides funding to both NSF and NASA to develop
technology for digital libraries huge data bases that store text
imagery video and sound and are accessible over computer
networks like NSFNET The bill also funds development of
prototype digital libraries around the country

The public needs NREN because 300 baud used to be fast and low
resolution graphics used to be pretty Now we get impatient
waiting for fax machines to print out a document from half a
continent away when a few years ago we would have been
content to wait days or weeks for the same article to arrive by mail
We are satisfied with technology until it starts to impede our lives
in some way We wait impatiently sure that we spend half our
lives waiting for printers and the other half waiting for disk drives
Time is a commodity

I can envision that little girl walking into the public library with the
following request
Im doing a school report on the Challenger disaster I need a video
clip of the explosion a sound bite of Richard Feynman explaining
the Oring problem some neat graphics from NASA oh and
maybe some virtual reality mockups of the shuttle interior Can
you put it all on this floppy disk for me I know its only 15 minutes
before you close but gee I had band practice This is why
public libraries need NREN

We would do well to remember the words of Ranganathan whose
basic tenets of good librarianship need just a little updating from
1931

Information is for use
Every bit of information its user
Every user hisher bit of information
Save the time of the user
A network is a growing organism

And so is the public library A promising future awaits the public
library that can be proactive rather than reactive to technology
Information technology is driving the future librarians should be at
the wheel It is hoped that the new Administration in Washington
will provide the fuel to get us going

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations

have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks
eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks

EBooks posted prior to November 2003 with eBook numbers BELOW 10000
are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year

httpwwwibiblioorggutenbergetext06

 Or etext 05 04 03 02 01 00 99
 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 92 91 or 90

EBooks posted since November 2003 with etext numbers OVER 10000 are
filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is
identical to the filename The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at

httpwwwgutenbergorg102310234

or filename 24689 would be found at
httpwwwgutenbergorg246824689
