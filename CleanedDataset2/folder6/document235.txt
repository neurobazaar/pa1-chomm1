INTERVIEW WITH WILLIAM GIBSON
by Giuseppe Salza


This interview will be included in the book NetSurfers
tentative title by Giuseppe Salza to be published by
Theoria Edizioni in Italy in Spring 1995


CANNES William Gibson was in Cannes in May 1994 to promote
the filming of Johnny Mnemonic a 26 million science fiction
movie based on his short story and starring megastar Keanu
Reeves as the main character Directed by the concept artist and
Gibsons pal Robert Longo  with a few music video and TV credits
but for the first time in charge of a feature the film also stars IceT
Dolph Lundgren Takeshi Kitano of the cult Sonatine Udo Kier
Henry Rollins and Dina Meyer William Gibson also wrote the
screenplay of his original story which was published in the anthology
Burning Chrome Johnny Mnemonic goes into wide release
in current 1995

In this interview William Gibson talks at length about Johnny
Mnemonic movies SF net culture and issues


What are your initial impressions on how Johnny Mnemonic is
turning out 

I have just seen the preassembled 10minute show reel I think it is
fantastic It felt very good seeing the universe of Johnny Mnemonic
taking a life on its own If it had been different I wouldnt probably
be here But it can be safe to say that Johnny Mnemonic has been
the optimal screen experience so far

Robert Longo the film director and I kind of had a mutual
experience with it We first tried to make a screen adaptation of
Johnny Mnemonic back in 1989 so we started pitching it around
film companies asking for money Didnt work out We realized
afterwards that our major mistake was asking too little money
Our aim back then was to make a little art movie we figured that
we would need less than 2 million dollars JeanLuc Godards
Alphaville was our main inspiration back then We should have
asked more money

We went through several script drafts and stages It became very
painful pursuing the project If it were just for me I would have
given up long ago It was really Roberts faith and persistence
in getting this film done that made it possible


Have you written any film scripts before besides this and the ill
fated drafts for Alien3

Yeah I have done a couple of screen adaptations that never got
made One was Burning Chrome EDKathryn Bigelow was
involved in it for a while and the other was NeuroHotel


What happened 

I dont really feel like talking about them Lets just say that
these projects have been developed to death It was getting
more and more frustrating and I didnt like that


Have you ever been involved in any other movie or TV project
before that 

I was gonna write a story for the Max Headroom series but the
network pulled the plug My friend John Shirley did a couple of
scripts for them Hes the one who convinced me I should have
written one too


The only thing which was left of your script for Alien3 was the
prisoners with the bar code tattooed on the back of their necks
What do you think in retrospect of this misadventure 

My script for Alien3 was kind of Tarkovskian Vincent Ward
EDthe director of The Navigator came late to the project
EDafter a number of other directors had been unsuccessfully
approached but I think he got the true meaning of my story
It would have been fun if he stayed on EDhe eventually quit
Alien3 was finally directed by David Fincher


You seem very detached from your previous experiences in movies
Johnny Mnemonic on the other hand seems very personal to you
Why is that 

I wrote the original story in 1980 I think it was perhaps the second
piece of fiction I ever wrote in my life It held up very good after all
these years Johnny was a start for many creative processes
it was in fact the root source of Neuromancer and Count Zero
It is only fair that the first script of mine that goes into production
should come from that from my early career

The world of Johnny Mnemonic takes for granted the Berlusconi
completion process I mean the media baron becoming one of the
Countrys leaders I think the distinction between politicians and
media is gonna disappear It already has in effect It is very sad


Its like saying that the theories you imagined in your science fiction
stories are becoming real

Yeah but people shouldnt look at science fiction like they look at
real fiction They shouldnt expect that this is what the future
is gonna look like We ED science fiction writers are sort of
charlatans we come up with a few ideas and we make a living out of that

When I wrote Neuromancer I would have never imagined AIDS
and the collapse of the USSR We never get the future right
I always thought that USSR was this big winter bear that would
always exist And look at what happened In 1993 I wrote an
afterword for the Hungarian version of Neuromancer I wrote that
nothing lives forever and that its time that the winds of democracy
blow over the East But now after the arrival of people like
Zhirinowsky I have second thoughts again and I fear for them


Now you also write geoanthropological reports

Thats right I did a portrait of Singapore for Wired Magazine
That place gave me the creeps


You are considered the true father of cyberpunk What do you think
of how this word has spread in the world and has gained new meanings 

It depends whether you believe in such a thing Cyberpunk has
become a historical word one of these words which you use to
describe a definite period of time The risk is that it could suddenly
become outdated passe Now it is a very fashionable thing to say
wearing cyberpunk outfit or behaving cyberpunk has become hip
you see it on MTV I was never comfortable with this interpretation
Billy Idol ED he released in 1993 the album Cyberpunk has
turned it into something very silly

Finally I think that cyberpunk is one of these journalistic terms
that media like to rely on I am aware that most young writers
are delighted being considered cyberpunk authors But Im older
I remember well the Sixties I know that once you have a label
attached onto you it is over


Lets go back to Johnny Mnemonic Which direction have you
given the screenplay 

Johnny is about the politics of Information Its an action film
of course but it doesnt forego for flashy and graphic FX theres too
much of that already on MTV Besides Billy Idol burned that look
We preferred opting for an antirealistic look we want to plunge
the audience into a very strange but consistent universe In short
we have decided to tell a story Thats what science fiction
literature has often managed to achieve unlike most films


Which science fiction movies you like most 

I like Blade Runner Andrej Tarkowskis Stalker Chris Markers
La jetee and also the British pilot for the Max Headroom
series ED it was directed by Rocky Morton  Annabel Jenkel


Johnny Mnemonic has a superstar Keanu Reeves What do you
think of his portrayal of your character 

Keanu is fantastic I have this problem I have never been able to
describe the character of Johnny until he came aboard One day in
the early stages of developement we were discussing the character
and I wasnt making a good job of doing that But he really
got Johnny from day one It helped me better understand this
person that I had imagined so I was able to make small
adjustments to the story I have always had a good attitude
towards actors and Keanu helped me reinforce that idea
Once Johnny got its second chance Robert Longo and I have
talked to each others on the phone at least once every day
Subsequently I was often on the sets during the filming doing
rewrites The sets of this picture were awesome Everything was
hung 50 feet up in the air They were quite dangerous you really
had to watch where to put your feet But I was able to not black out


You and Bruce Sterling are the forefathers of the new science fiction
Isnt it ironical that he is very fascinated by hackers and the new edge
whereas youre not a technical person 

Bruce practically lives on the Internet I dont even have a modem
or email My computer is outdated by any standards of criteria
I never was a technical guy and never will be Im a writer
and poetry and pop culture are the two things which fascinate me most
Im not deeply excited by hitech The Edge of the U2 was over here
the other day and he was showing me Net stuff He showed how he
could telnet to his Los Angeles computer and he was very excited
Ill never be like that However I feel obliged to be ambivalent
towards technology I cant be a techie but I cant hate it either


You have written Virtual Light So what do you think of Virtual
Reality 

If we take what I consider the Sunday paper supplement of VR
I mean Goggles  Gloves I think that it has become very obvious
very cliche I think that real VR is gonna come out from the new
generation of visual effects in movies I met Jim Cameron when he
was editing Terminator 2 he showed me the clips of the T1000
emerging from fire in the LA canal He said they were gonna use
the actor for the whole shot but it was easier for them to do it in
digital This is the future One day there will be entire virtual
replicas of real actors

Incidentally the book Im writing now is about virtual celebrities
Its the story of a guy who becomes obsessed with the virtual replica of
a star and falls in love with her


Youre not fascinated by technology and yet you come up with ideas
on the edge

When I write my books my favorite part is always art direction
not the plot I admit I like giving people a visual impression
of the world Im creating Then I have to remind myself that
I have to tell a story foremost


Another issue you focus on are Information Superhighways
What actions have you taken 

Bruce Sterling and I went to the National Academy in Washington to
address the Al Gore people We told them that this is the last
chance to give the poorest schools equal chances than the richest
In a few years it will be too late and we wont be able to fill up the gap

To me Information Highways are best described by the most
interesting image Ive seen on TV during the Los Angeles riot
A Radio Shack shop ED a chain of shops selling consumer
electronics gear was being looted Next to that there was an Apple
shop and it was untouched People wanted to steal portable TVs
and CD players not computers I think this clearly indicated the
gaps of culture or simply the gaps of chances in our society
Besides the Information Highway issue gives the public a false
perception They dont wanna offer you exhaustive accesses to
information they wanna offer you a new shopping mall


What do you think of the Clipper issue 

The NSA wants to legislate that every computer manifactured in the
US will have a chip built inside that will allow the Government
to decrypt the information The worst thing is that people are not
informed of what is at stake here Who would buy a computer with a
spy inside The Clipper chip is an admission of incompetence
They say they wanna be able to decrypt the information that would
jeopardize National Security But to can prevent the Medellin cartel
to buy  say  into a Swiss corporation which comes up with a new
encryption system which totally cuts out the Clipper 

Encryption programs are stronger and stronger There is a new one
called Stego which is free on Internet It takes written material and
hides it in visual elements I send a digitized epostcard from
Cannes and there is half a novel hidden in its data Ive seen it work
I havent understood the half of it yet

Man the Clipper chip is fucked anyway Most of the new edge guys
are into computers and theyre coming up with new gear nobody
had the slightest clue about five years ago I saw recently a
prototype which looked like a beeper but it was a virtual telephone
Unfortunately we have to deal with more paper than before We are
submerged by tons of paper


Wait a second A few minutes you said youre not into hitech and
now youre raving about it

Im not a techie I dont know how these things work But I like
what they do and the new human processes that they generate


What is in your opinion the most important technological
breakthrough of our society in recent years 

My favorite piece of technology is the Walkman It forever changed
the way we perceive music The Walkman has given us the opportunity
to listen to whatever kind of music we wanted wherever we wanted

The Fax machine is also an amazing thing We live in a
very different world because of that instantaneous written
communication everywhere It is also a very political technology
as the Tien An Men Square events told us


What about email 

Email is very glamorous Way too glamorous

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks
eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks

EBooks posted prior to November 2003 with eBook numbers BELOW 10000
are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year

httpwwwibiblioorggutenbergetext06

 Or etext 05 04 03 02 01 00 99
 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 92 91 or 90

EBooks posted since November 2003 with etext numbers OVER 10000 are
filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is
identical to the filename The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at

httpwwwgutenbergorg102310234

or filename 24689 would be found at
