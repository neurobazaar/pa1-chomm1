CHAPTER I A BOY AND HIS DOG

Penrod sat morosely upon the back fence and gazed with envy at Duke his
wistful dog

A bitter soul dominated the various curved and angular surfaces known
by a careless world as the face of Penrod Schofield Except in solitude
that face was almost always cryptic and emotionless for Penrod had
come into his twelfth year wearing an expression carefully trained to be
inscrutable Since the world was sure to misunderstand everything mere
defensive instinct prompted him to give it as little as possible to lay
hold upon Nothing is more impenetrable than the face of a boy who has
learned this and Penrods was habitually as fathomless as the depth
of his hatred this morning for the literary activities of Mrs Lora
Rewbushan almost universally respected fellow citizen a lady of
charitable and poetic inclinations and one of his own mothers most
intimate friends

Mrs Lora Rewbush had written something which she called The Childrens
Pageant of the Table Round and it was to be performed in public that
very afternoon at the Womens Arts and Guild Hall for the benefit of the
Coloured Infants Betterment Society And if any flavour of sweetness
remained in the nature of Penrod Schofield after the dismal trials of
the schoolweek just past that problematic infinitesimal remnant was
made pungent acid by the imminence of his destiny to form a prominent
feature of the spectacle and to declaim the loathsome sentiments of a
character named upon the programme the Child Sir Lancelot

After each rehearsal he had plotted escape and only ten days earlier
there had been a glimmer of light Mrs Lora Rewbush caught a very
bad cold and it was hoped it might develop into pneumonia but she
recovered so quickly that not even a rehearsal of the Childrens Pageant
was postponed Darkness closed in Penrod had rather vaguely debated
plans for a selfmutilation such as would make his appearance as the
Child Sir Lancelot inexpedient on public grounds it was a heroic
and attractive thought but the results of some extremely sketchy
preliminary experiments caused him to abandon it

There was no escape and at last his hour was hard upon him Therefore
he brooded on the fence and gazed with envy at his wistful Duke

The dogs name was undescriptive of his person which was obviously
the result of a singular series of mesalliances He wore a grizzled
moustache and indefinite whiskers he was small and shabby and looked
like an old postman Penrod envied Duke because he was sure Duke would
never be compelled to be a Child Sir Lancelot He thought a dog free and
unshackled to go or come as the wind listeth Penrod forgot the life he
led Duke

There was a long soliloquy upon the fence a plaintive monologue without
words the boys thoughts were adjectives but they were expressed by
a running film of pictures in his minds eye morbidly prophetic of the
hideosities before him Finally he spoke aloud with such spleen that
Duke rose from his haunches and lifted one ear in keen anxiety

 I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake the Child
 Gentulhearted meek and mild
 What though Im BUT a littul child
 Gentulhearted meek and OOF

All of this except oof was a quotation from the Child Sir Lancelot as
conceived by Mrs Lora Rewbush Choking upon it Penrod slid down from
the fence and with slow and thoughtful steps entered a onestoried wing
of the stable consisting of a single apartment floored with cement and
used as a storeroom for broken bricabrac old paintbuckets decayed
gardenhose wornout carpets dead furniture and other condemned odds
and ends not yet considered hopeless enough to be given away

In one corner stood a large box a part of the building itself it was
eight feet high and open at the top and it had been constructed as a
sawdust magazine from which was drawn material for the horses bed in
a stall on the other side of the partition The big box so high and
towerlike so commodious so suggestive had ceased to fulfil its
legitimate function though providentially it had been at least half
full of sawdust when the horse died Two years had gone by since that
passing an interregnum in transportation during which Penrods father
was thinking he explained sometimes of an automobile Meanwhile the
gifted and generous sawdustbox had served brilliantly in war and peace
it was Penrods stronghold

There was a partially defaced sign upon the front wall of the box the
donjonkeep had known mercantile impulses

 The O K RaBiT Co
 PENROD ScHoFiELD AND CO
 iNQuiRE FOR PRicEs

This was a venture of the preceding vacation and had netted at one
time an accrued and owed profit of 138 Prospects had been brightest
on the very eve of cataclysm The storeroom was locked and guarded but
twentyseven rabbits and Belgian hares old and young had perished here
on a single nightthrough no human agency but in a foray of cats the
besiegers treacherously tunnelling up through the sawdust from the small
aperture which opened into the stall beyond the partition Commerce has
its martyrs

Penrod climbed upon a barrel stood on tiptoe grasped the rim of the
box then using a knothole as a stirrup threw one leg over the top
drew himself up and dropped within Standing upon the packed sawdust
he was just tall enough to see over the top

Duke had not followed him into the storeroom but remained near the open
doorway in a concave and pessimistic attitude Penrod felt in a dark
corner of the box and laid hands upon a simple apparatus consisting of
an old bushelbasket with a few yards of clothesline tied to each of
its handles He passed the ends of the lines over a big spool which
revolved upon an axle of wire suspended from a beam overhead and with
the aid of this improvised pulley lowered the empty basket until it
came to rest in an upright position upon the floor of the storeroom at
the foot of the sawdustbox

Elevater shouted Penrod Tingting

Duke old and intelligently apprehensive approached slowly in a
semicircular manner deprecatingly but with courtesy He pawed the
basket delicately then as if that were all his master had expected of
him uttered one bright bark sat down and looked up triumphantly His
hypocrisy was shallow many a horrible quarter of an hour had taught him
his duty in this matter

EleVAYter shouted Penrod sternly You want me to come down there
to you

Duke looked suddenly haggard He pawed the basket feebly again and
upon another outburst from on high prostrated himself flat Again
threatened he gave a superb impersonation of a worm

You get in that eleVAYter

Reckless with despair Duke jumped into the basket landing in a
dishevelled posture which he did not alter until he had been drawn
up and poured out upon the floor of sawdust with the box There
shuddering he lay in doughnut shape and presently slumbered

It was dark in the box a condition that might have been remedied by
sliding back a small wooden panel on runners which would have let in
ample light from the alley but Penrod Schofield had more interesting
means of illumination He knelt and from a former soapbox in a
corner took a lantern without a chimney and a large oilcan the leak
in the latter being so nearly imperceptible that its banishment
from household use had seemed to Penrod as inexplicable as it was
providential

He shook the lantern near his ear nothing splashed there was no sound
but a dry clinking But there was plenty of kerosene in the can and he
filled the lantern striking a match to illumine the operation Then he
lit the lantern and hung it upon a nail against the wall The sawdust
floor was slightly impregnated with oil and the open flame quivered in
suggestive proximity to the side of the box however some rather deep
charrings of the plank against which the lantern hung offered evidence
that the arrangement was by no means a new one and indicated at least a
possibility of no fatality occurring this time

Next Penrod turned up the surface of the sawdust in another corner
of the floor and drew forth a cigarbox in which were half a
dozen cigarettes made of hayseed and thick brown wrapping paper a
leadpencil an eraser and a small notebook the cover of which was
labelled in his own handwriting

The first page of this book was purely academic but the study of
English undefiled terminated with a slight jar at the top of the second

And the subsequent entries in the book appeared to have little concern
with Room 6 Ward School Nomber Seventh



CHAPTER II ROMANCE

The author of Harold Ramorez etc lit one of the hayseed cigarettes
seated himself comfortably with his back against the wall and his
right shoulder just under the lantern elevated his knees to support the
notebook turned to a blank page and wrote slowly and earnestly

CHAPITER THE SIXTH


He took a knife from his pocket and broodingly his eyes upon the
inward embryos of vision sharpened his pencil After that he extended
a foot and meditatively rubbed Dukes back with the side of his shoe
Creation with Penrod did not leap fullarmed from the brain but
finally he began to produce He wrote very slowly at first and then
with increasing rapidity faster and faster gathering momentum and
growing more and more fevered as he sped till at last the true fire
came without which no lamp of real literature may be made to burn


Mr Wilson reched for his gun but our hero had him covred and soon said
Well I guess you dont come any of that on me my freind

Well what makes you so sure about it sneered the other bitting his lip
so savageley that the blood ran You are nothing but a common Roadagent
any way and I do not propose to be bafled by such Ramorez laughed at
this and kep Mr Wilson covred by his ottomatick

Soon the two men were struggling together in the deathroes but soon Mr
Wilson got him bound and gaged his mouth and went away for awhile leavin
our hero it was dark and he writhd at his bonds writhing on the floor
wile the rats came out of their holes and bit him and vernim got all
over him from the floor of that helish spot but soon he managed to push
the gag out of his mouth with the end of his toungeu and got all his
bonds off

Soon Mr Wilson came back to tant him with his helpless condition flowed
by his gang of detectives and they said Oh look at Ramorez sneering at
his plight and tanted him with his helpless condition because Ramorez
had put the bonds back sos he would look the same but could throw them
off him when he wanted to Just look at him now sneered they To hear him
talk you would thought he was hot stuff and they said Look at him now
him that was going to do so much Oh I would not like to be in his fix

Soon Harold got mad at this and jumped up with blasing eyes throwin off
his bonds like they were air Ha Ha sneered he I guess you better not
talk so much next time Soon there flowed another awful struggle and
siezin his ottomatick back from Mr Wilson he shot two of the detectives
through the heart Bing Bing went the ottomatick and two more went to
meet their Maker only two detectives left now and so he stabbed one and
the scondrel went to meet his Maker for now our hero was fighting
for his very life It was dark in there now for night had falen and a
terrible view met the eye Blood was just all over everything and the
rats were eatin the dead men

Soon our hero manged to get his back to the wall for he was fighting
for his very life now and shot Mr Wilson through the abodmen Oh said Mr
Wilson you   The dashes are Penrods

Mr Wilson stagerd back vile oaths soilin his lips for he was in pain Why
you you sneered he I will get you yet you Harold Ramorez

The remainin scondrel had an ax which he came near our heros head with
but missed him and ramand stuck in the wall Our heros amunition was
exhaused what was he to do the remanin scondrel would soon get his ax
lose so our hero sprung forward and bit him till his teeth met in the
flech for now our hero was fighting for his very life At this the
remanin scondrel also cursed and swore vile oaths Oh sneered he
 you Harold Ramorez what did you bite me for Yes sneered Mr
Wilson also and he has shot me in the abdomen too the

Soon they were both cursin and reviln him together Why you  
 sneered they what did you want to injure us foryou Harold
Ramorez you have not got any sence and you think you are so much but you
are no better than anybody else and you are a    


Soon our hero could stand this no longer If you could learn to act like
gentlmen said he I would not do any more to you now and your low vile
exppresions have not got any effect on me only to injure your own self
when you go to meet your Maker Oh I guess you have had enogh for one day
and I think you have learned a lesson and will not soon atemp to beard
Harold Ramorez again so with a tantig laugh he cooly lit a cigarrete and
takin the keys of the cell from Mr Wilson poket went on out

Soon Mr Wilson and the wonded detective manged to bind up their wonds
and got up off the floor it I will have that dasstads life now
sneered they if we have to swing for it   him he shall
not eccape us again the low down    

Chapiter seventh

A mule train of heavily laden burros laden with gold from the mines was
to be seen wondering among the highest clifts and gorgs of the Rocky Mts
and a tall man with a long silken mustash and a cartigde belt could be
heard cursin vile oaths because he well knew this was the lair of Harold
Ramorez Why  you you    mules you sneered he
because the poor mules were not able to go any quicker  you I will
show you Why     it sneered he his oaths growing
viler and viler I will whip you      you
sos you will not be able to walk for a week you you mean old
       mules you

Scarcly had the vile words left his lips when


PENROD

It was his mothers voice calling from the back porch

Simultaneously the noon whistles began to blow far and near and the
romancer in the sawdustbox summoned prosaically from steep mountain
passes above the clouds paused with stubby pencil halfway from lip to
knee His eyes were shining there was a rapt sweetness in his gaze As
he wrote his burden had grown lighter thoughts of Mrs Lora Rewbush
had almost left him and in particular as he recounted even by
the chaste dash the annoyed expressions of Mr Wilson the wounded
detective and the silken moustached muledriver he had felt
mysteriously relieved concerning the Child Sir Lancelot Altogether he
looked a better and a brighter boy

PenROD

The rapt look faded slowly He sighed but moved not

Penrod Were having lunch early just on your account so youll have
plenty of time to be dressed for the pageant Hurry

There was silence in Penrods aerie

PENrod

Mrs Schofields voice sounded nearer indicating a threatened approach
Penrod bestirred himself he blew out the lantern and shouted
plaintively

Well aint I coming fasts I can

Do hurry returned the voice withdrawing and the kitchen door could
be heard to close

Languidly Penrod proceeded to set his house in order

Replacing his manuscript and pencil in the cigarbox he carefully
buried the box in the sawdust put the lantern and oilcan back in the
soapbox adjusted the elevator for the reception of Duke and in no
uncertain tone invited the devoted animal to enter

Duke stretched himself amiably affecting not to hear and when this
pretence became so obvious that even a dog could keep it up no longer
sat down in a corner facing it his back to his master and his head
perpendicular nose upward supported by the convergence of the two
walls This from a dog is the last word the comble of the immutable
Penrod commanded stormed tried gentleness persuaded with honeyed
words and pictured rewards Dukes eyes looked backward otherwise
he moved not Time elapsed Penrod stooped to flattery finally to
insincere caresses then losing patience spouted sudden threats

Duke remained immovable frozen fast to his great gesture of implacable
despair

A footstep sounded on the threshold of the storeroom

Penrod come down from that box this instant

Maam

Are you up in that sawdustbox again As Mrs Schofield had just heard
her sons voice issue from the box and also as she knew he was there
anyhow her question must have been put for oratorical purposes only
Because if you are she continued promptly Im going to ask your
papa not to let you play there any

Penrods forehead his eyes the tops of his ears and most of his hair
became visible to her at the top of the box I aint playing he
said indignantly

Well what ARE you doing

Just coming down he replied in a grieved but patient tone

Then why dont you COME

I got Duke here I got to get him DOWN havent I You dont suppose I
want to leave a poor dog in here to starve do you

Well hand him down over the side to me Let me

Ill get him down all right said Penrod I got him up here and I
guess I can get him down

Well then DO it

I will if youll let me alone If youll go on back to the house I
promise to be there inside of two minutes Honest

He put extreme urgency into this and his mother turned toward the
house If youre not there in two minutes

I will be

After her departure Penrod expended some finalities of eloquence upon
Duke then disgustedly gathered him up in his arms dumped him into the
basket and shouting sternly All in for the ground floorstep back
there madamall ready Jim lowered dog and basket to the floor
of the storeroom Duke sprang out in tumultuous relief and bestowed
frantic affection upon his master as the latter slid down from the box

Penrod dusted himself sketchily experiencing a sense of satisfaction
dulled by the overhanging afternoon perhaps but perceptible he had
the feeling of one who has been true to a cause The operation of the
elevator was unsinful and save for the shock to Dukes nervous system
it was harmless but Penrod could not possibly have brought himself to
exhibit it in the presence of his mother or any other grown person in
the world The reasons for secrecy were undefined at least Penrod did
not define them



CHAPTER III THE COSTUME

After lunch his mother and his sister Margaret a pretty girl of
nineteen dressed him for the sacrifice They stood him near his
mothers bedroom window and did what they would to him

During the earlier anguishes of the process he was mute exceeding the
pathos of the stricken calf in the shambles but a student of eyes
might have perceived in his soul the premonitory symptoms of a sinister
uprising At a rehearsal in citizens clothes attended by mothers and
grownup sisters Mrs Lora Rewbush had announced that she wished the
costuming to be as medieval and artistic as possible Otherwise and
as to details she said she would leave the costumes entirely to the
good taste of the childrens parents Mrs Schofield and Margaret were
no archeologists but they knew that their taste was as good as that of
other mothers and sisters concerned so with perfect confidence they had
planned and executed a costume for Penrod and the only misgiving they
felt was connected with the tractability of the Child Sir Lancelot
himself

Stripped to his underwear he had been made to wash himself vehemently
then they began by shrouding his legs in a pair of silk stockings once
blue but now mostly whitish Upon Penrod they visibly surpassed mere
ampleness but they were long and it required only a rather loose
imagination to assume that they were tights

The upper part of his body was next concealed from view by a garment
so peculiar that its description becomes difficult In 1886 Mrs
Schofield then unmarried had worn at her comingout party a dress of
vivid salmon silk which had been remodelled after her marriage to accord
with various epochs of fashion until a final unskilful campaign at a
dyehouse had left it in a condition certain to attract much attention
to the wearer Mrs Schofield had considered giving it to Della the
cook but had decided not to do so because you never could tell how
Della was going to take things and cooks were scarce

It may have been the word medieval in Mrs Lora Rewbushs rich
phrase which had inspired the idea for a last conspicuous usefulness
at all events the bodice of that once salmon dress somewhat modified
and moderated now took a position for its farewell appearance in
society upon the back breast and arms of the Child Sir Lancelot

The area thus costumed ceased at the waist leaving a Jaegerlike and
unmedieval gap thence to the tops of the stockings The inventive genius
of woman triumphantly bridged it but in a manner which imposes upon
history almost insuperable delicacies of narration Penrods father
was an oldfashioned man the twentieth century had failed to shake his
faith in red flannel for cold weather and it was while Mrs Schofield
was putting away her husbands winter underwear that she perceived how
hopelessly one of the elder specimens had dwindled and simultaneously
she received the inspiration which resulted in a pair of trunks for the
Child Sir Lancelot and added an earnest bit of colour as well as a
genuine touch of the Middle Ages to his costume Reversed fore to aft
with the greater part of the legs cut off and strips of silver braid
covering the seams this garment she felt was not traceable to its
original source

When it had been placed upon Penrod the stockings were attached to it
by a system of safetypins not very perceptible at a distance Next
after being severely warned against stooping Penrod got his feet into
the slippers he wore to dancingschoolpatentleather pumps now
decorated with large pink rosettes

If I cant stoop he began smolderingly Id like to know howm I
goin to kneel in the pag

You must MANAGE This uttered through pins was evidently thought to
be sufficient

They fastened some ruching about his slender neck pinned ribbons at
random all over him and then Margaret thickly powdered his hair

Oh yes thats all right she said replying to a question put by her
mother They always powdered their hair in Colonial times

It doesnt seem right to meexactly objected Mrs Schofield gently
Sir Lancelot must have been ever so long before Colonial times

That doesnt matter Margaret reassured her Nobodyll know the
differenceMrs Lora Rewbush least of all I dont think she knows a
thing about it though of course she does write splendidly and the
words of the pageant are just beautiful Stand still Penrod The
author of Harold Ramorez had moved convulsively Besides powdered
hairs always becoming Look at him Youd hardly know it was Penrod

The pride and admiration with which she pronounced this undeniable truth
might have been thought tactless but Penrod not analytical found his
spirits somewhat elevated No mirror was in his range of vision and
though he had submitted to cursory measurements of his person a week
earlier he had no previous acquaintance with the costume He began
to form a not unpleasing mental picture of his appearance something
somewhere between the portraits of George Washington and a vivid memory
of Miss Julia Marlowe at a matinee of Twelfth Night

He was additionally cheered by a sword which had been borrowed from a
neighbor who was a Knight of Pythias Finally there was a mantle an
old golf cape of Margarets Fluffy polkadots of white cotton had been
sewed to it generously also it was ornamented with a large cross of
red flannel suggested by the picture of a Crusader in a newspaper
advertisement The mantle was fastened to Penrods shoulder that is
to the shoulder of Mrs Schofields exbodice by means of large
safetypins and arranged to hang down behind him touching his heels
but obscuring nowise the glory of his facade Then at last he was
allowed to step before a mirror

It was a fulllength glass and the worst immediately happened It might
have been a little less violent perhaps if Penrods expectations had
not been so richly and poetically idealized but as things were the
revolt was volcanic

Victor Hugos account of the fight with the devilfish in Toilers
of the Sea encourages a belief that had Hugo lived and increased in
power he might have been equal to a proper recital of the half
hour which followed Penrods first sight of himself as the Child Sir
Lancelot But Mr Wilson himself dastard but eloquent foe of Harold
Ramorez could not have expressed with all the vile dashes at
his command the sentiments which animated Penrods bosom when the
instantaneous and unalterable conviction descended upon him that he was
intended by his loved ones to make a public spectacle of himself in his
sisters stockings and part of an old dress of his mothers

To him these familiar things were not disguised at all there seemed no
possibility that the whole world would not know them at a glance The
stockings were worse than the bodice He had been assured that these
could not be recognized but seeing them in the mirror he was sure
that no human eye could fail at first glance to detect the difference
between himself and the former purposes of these stockings Fold
wrinkle and void shrieked their history with a hundred tongues
invoking earthquake eclipse and blue ruin The frantic youths final
submission was obtained only after a painful telephonic conversation
between himself and his father the latter having been called up and
upon by the exhausted Mrs Schofield to subjugate his offspring by
wire

The two ladies made all possible haste after this to deliver
Penrod into the hands of Mrs Lora Rewbush nevertheless they found
opportunity to exchange earnest congratulations upon his not having
recognized the humble but serviceable paternal garment now brilliant
about the Lancelotish middle Altogether they felt that the costume
was a success Penrod looked like nothing ever remotely imagined by
Sir Thomas Malory or Alfred Tennysonfor that matter he looked like
nothing ever before seen on earth but as Mrs Schofield and Margaret
took their places in the audience at the Womens Arts and Guild Hall
the anxiety they felt concerning Penrods elocutionary and gesticular
powers so soon to be put to public test was pleasantly tempered by
their satisfaction that owing to their efforts his outward appearance
would be a credit to the family



CHAPTER IV DESPERATION

The Child Sir Lancelot found himself in a large anteroom behind the
stagea room crowded with excited children all about equally medieval
and artistic Penrod was less conspicuous than he thought himself but
he was so preoccupied with his own shame steeling his nerves to meet
the first inevitable taunting reference to his sisters stockings
that he failed to perceive there were others present in much of his own
unmanned condition Retiring to a corner immediately upon his entrance
he managed to unfasten the mantle at the shoulders and drawing it
round him pinned it again at his throat so that it concealed the rest
of his costume This permitted a temporary relief but increased his
horror of the moment when in pursuance of the action of the pageant
the sheltering garment must be cast aside

Some of the other child knights were also keeping their mantles close
about them A few of the envied opulent swung brilliant fabrics
from their shoulders airily showing off hired splendours from a
professional costumers stock while one or two were insulting examples
of parental indulgence particularly little Maurice Levy the Child Sir
Galahad This shrinking person went clamorously about making it known
everywhere that the best tailor in town had been dazzled by a great
sum into constructing his costume It consisted of blue velvet
knickerbockers a white satin waistcoat and a beautifully cut little
swallowtailed coat with pearl buttons The medieval and artistic
triumph was completed by a mantle of yellow velvet and little white
boots sporting gold tassels

All this radiance paused in a brilliant career and addressed the Child
Sir Lancelot gathering an immediately formed semicircular audience of
little girls Woman was ever the trailer of magnificence

What YOU got on inquired Mr Levy after dispensing information
What you got on under that ole golf cape

Penrod looked upon him coldly At other times his questioner would have
approached him with deference even with apprehension But today the
Child Sir Galahad was somewhat intoxicated with the power of his own
beauty

What YOU got on he repeated

Oh nothin said Penrod with an indifference assumed at great cost
to his nervous system

The elate Maurice was inspired to set up as a wit Then youre nakid
he shouted exultantly Penrod Schofield says he hasnt got nothin on
under that ole golf cape Hes nakid Hes nakid

The indelicate little girls giggled delightedly and a javelin pierced
the inwards of Penrod when he saw that the Child Elaine ambercurled
and beautiful Marjorie Jones lifted golden laughter to the horrid jest

Other boys and girls came flocking to the uproar Hes nakid hes
nakid shrieked the Child Sir Galahad Penrod Schofields nakid Hes
NAAAKID

Hush hush said Mrs Lora Rewbush pushing her way into the group
Remember we are all little knights and ladies today Little knights
and ladies of the Table Round would not make so much noise Now
children we must begin to take our places on the stage Is everybody
here

Penrod made his escape under cover of this diversion he slid behind
Mrs Lora Rewbush and being near a door opened it unnoticed and went
out quickly closing it behind him He found himself in a narrow and
vacant hallway which led to a door marked Janitors Room

Burning with outrage heartsick at the sweet coldblooded laughter
of Marjorie Jones Penrod rested his elbows upon a windowsill and
speculated upon the effects of a leap from the second story One of the
reasons he gave it up was his desire to live on Maurice Levys account
already he was forming educational plans for the Child Sir Galahad

A stout man in blue overalls passed through the hallway muttering to
himself petulantly I reckon theyll find that hall hot enough NOW he
said conveying to Penrod an impression that some too feminine women had
sent him upon an unreasonable errand to the furnace He went into the
Janitors Room and emerging a moment later minus the overalls passed
Penrod again with a bass rumbleDern em it seemed he saidand
made a gloomy exit by the door at the upper end of the hallway

The conglomerate and delicate rustle of a large mannerly audience was
heard as the janitor opened and closed the door and stagefright
seized the boy The orchestra began an overture and at that Penrod
trembling violently tiptoed down the hall into the Janitors Room It
was a culdesac There was no outlet save by the way he had come

Despairingly he doffed his mantle and looked down upon himself for
a last sickening assurance that the stockings were as obviously and
disgracefully Margarets as they had seemed in the mirror at home For a
moment he was encouraged perhaps he was no worse than some of the
other boys Then he noticed that a safetypin had opened one of those
connecting the stockings with his trunks He sat down to fasten it
and his eye fell for the first time with particular attention upon the
trunks Until this instant he had been preoccupied with the stockings

Slowly recognition dawned in his eyes

The Schofields house stood on a corner at the intersection of two
maintravelled streets the fence was low and the publicity obtained by
the washable portion of the family apparel on Mondays had often been
painful to Penrod for boys have a peculiar sensitiveness in these
matters A plain matteroffact washerwoman employed by Mrs
Schofield never left anything to the imagination of the passerby and
of all her calm display the scarlet flaunting of his fathers winter
wear had most abashed Penrod One day Marjorie Jones all gold and
starch had passed when the dreadful things were on the line Penrod had
hidden himself shuddering The whole town he was convinced knew these
garments intimately and derisively

And now as he sat in the janitors chair the horrible and paralyzing
recognition came He had not an instants doubt that every fellow actor
as well as every soul in the audience would recognize what his mother
and sister had put upon him For as the awful truth became plain to
himself it seemed blazoned to the world and far far louder than the
stockings the trunks did fairly bellow the grisly secret WHOSE they
were and WHAT they were

Most people have suffered in a dream the experience of finding
themselves very inadequately clad in the midst of a crowd of
welldressed people and such dreamers sensations are comparable to
Penrods though faintly because Penrod was awake and in much too full
possession of the most active capacities for anguish

A human male whose dress has been damaged or reveals some vital lack
suffers from a hideous and shameful loneliness which makes every
second absolutely unbearable until he is again as others of his sex and
species and there is no act or sin whatever too desperate for him in
his struggle to attain that condition Also there is absolutely no
embarrassment possible to a woman which is comparable to that of a man
under corresponding circumstances and in this a boy is a man Gazing
upon the ghastly trunks the stricken Penrod felt that he was a degree
worse then nude and a great horror of himself filled his soul

Penrod Schofield

The door into the hallway opened and a voice demanded him He could not
be seen from the hallway but the hue and the cry was up and he knew
he must be taken It was only a question of seconds He huddled in his
chair

Penrod Schofield cried Mrs Lora Rewbush angrily

The distracted boy rose and as he did so a long pin sank deep into his
back He extracted it frenziedly which brought to his ears a protracted
and sonorous ripping too easily located by a final gesture of horror

Penrod Schofield Mrs Lora Rewbush had come out into the hallway

And now in this extremity when all seemed lost indeed particularly
including honour the dilating eye of the outlaw fell upon the blue
overalls which the janitor had left hanging upon a peg

Inspiration and action were almost simultaneous



CHAPTER V THE PAGEANT OF THE TABLE ROUND


Penrod Mrs Lora Rewbush stood in the doorway indignantly gazing
upon a Child Sir Lancelot mantled to the heels Do you know that you
have kept an audience of five hundred people waiting for ten minutes
She also detained the five hundred while she spake further

Well said Penrod contentedly as he followed her toward the buzzing
stage I was just sitting there thinking

Two minutes later the curtain rose on a medieval castle hall richly done
in the new stagecraft made in Germany and consisting of pink and blue
cheesecloth The Child King Arthur and the Child Queen Guinevere were
disclosed upon thrones with the Child Elaine and many other celebrities
in attendance while about fifteen Child Knights were seated at a
diningroom table round which was covered with a large Oriental rug
and displayed for the knights refreshment a banquet service of silver
lovingcups and trophies borrowed from the Country Club and some local
automobile manufacturers

In addition to this splendour potted plants and palms have seldom been
more lavishly used in any castle on the stage or off

The footlights were aided by a spotlight from the rear of the hall
and the children were revealed in a blaze of glory

A hushed multitudinous OOH of admiration came from the decorous and
delighted audience Then the children sang feebly

 Chuldrun of the Tabul Round
 Littul knights and ladies we
 Let our voysiz all resound
 Faith and hope and charitee

The Child King Arthur rose extended his sceptre with the decisive
gesture of a semaphore and spake

 Each littul knight and lady born
 Has noble deeds TO perform
 In THEE childworld of shivullree
 No matter how small his share may be
 Let each advance and tell in turn
 What claim has each to knighthood earn

The Child Sir Mordred the villain of this piece rose in his place
at the table round and piped the only lines ever written by Mrs Lora
Rewbush which Penrod Schofield could have pronounced without loathing
Georgie Bassett a really angelic boy had been selected for the role of
Mordred His perfect conduct had earned for him the sardonic sobriquet
The Little Gentleman among his boy acquaintances Naturally he had
no friends Hence the other boys supposed that he had been selected for
the wicked Mordred as a reward of virtue He declaimed serenely

 I hight Sir Mordred the Child and I teach
 Lessons of selfishest evil and reach
 Out into darkness Thoughtless unkind
 And ruthless is Mordred and unrefined

The Child Mordred was properly rebuked and denied the accolade though
like the others he seemed to have assumed the title already He made
a plotters exit Whereupon Maurice Levy rose bowed announced that he
highted the Child Sir Galahad and continued with perfect sangfroid

 I am the purest of the pure
 I have but kindest thoughts each day
 I give my riches to the poor
 And follow in the Masters way

This elicited tokens of approval from the Child King Arthur and he bade
Maurice stand forth and come near the throne a command obeyed with
the easy grace of conscious merit

It was Penrods turn He stepped back from his chair the table between
him and the audience and began in a high breathless monotone

 I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake the Child
 Gentulhearted meek and mild
 What though Im BUT a littul child
 Gentulheartud meek and mild
 I do my share though butthough but

Penrod paused and gulped The voice of Mrs Lora Rewbush was heard from
the wings prompting irritably and the Child Sir Lancelot repeated

 I do my share though butthough but a tot
 I pray you knight Sir Lancelot

This also met the royal favour and Penrod was bidden to join Sir
Galahad at the throne As he crossed the stage Mrs Schofield whispered
to Margaret

That boy Hes unpinned his mantle and fixed it to cover his whole
costume After we worked so hard to make it becoming

Never mind hell have to take the cape off in a minute returned
Margaret She leaned forward suddenly narrowing her eyes to see
better What IS that thing hanging about his left ankle she whispered
uneasily How queer He must have got tangled in something

Where asked Mrs Schofield in alarm

His left foot It makes him stumble Dont you see It looksit looks
like an elephants foot

The Child Sir Lancelot and the Child Sir Galahad clasped hands before
their Child King Penrod was conscious of a great uplift in a moment he
would have to throw aside his mantle but even so he was protected and
sheltered in the human garment of a man His stagefright had passed
for the audience was but an indistinguishable blur of darkness beyond
the dazzling lights His most repulsive speech that in which he
proclaimed himself a tot was over and done with and now at last the
small moist hand of the Child Sir Galahad lay within his own Craftily
his brown fingers stole from Maurices palm to the wrist The two boys
declaimed in concert

 We are two chuldrun of the Tabul Round
 Strewing kindness all around
 With love and good deeds striving ever for the best
 May our littul efforts eer be blest
 Two littul hearts we offer See
 United in love faith hope and charOW

The conclusion of the duet was marred The Child Sir Galahad suddenly
stiffened and uttering an irrepressible shriek of anguish gave a
brief exhibition of the contortionists art HES TWISTIN MY WRIST
DERN YOU LEGGO

The voice of Mrs Lora Rewbush was again heard from the wings it
sounded bloodthirsty Penrod released his victim and the Child King
Arthur somewhat disconcerted extended his sceptre and with the
assistance of the enraged prompter said

 Sweet childfriends of the Tabul Round
 In brotherly love and kindness abound
 Sir Lancelot you have spoken well
 Sir Galahad too as clear as bell
 So now pray doff your mantles gay
 You shall be knighted this very day

And Penrod doffed his mantle

Simultaneously a thick and vasty gasp came from the audience as
from five hundred bathers in a wholly unexpected surf This gasp was
punctuated irregularly over the auditorium by imperfectly subdued
screams both of dismay and incredulous joy and by two dismal shrieks
Altogether it was an extraordinary sound a sound never to be forgotten
by any one who heard it It was almost as unforgettable as the sight
which caused it the word sight being here used in its vernacular
sense for Penrod standing unmantled and revealed in all the medieval
and artistic glory of the janitors blue overalls falls within its
meaning

The janitor was a heavy man and his overalls upon Penrod were merely
oceanic The boy was at once swaddled and lost within their blue
gulfs and vast saggings and the left leg too hastily rolled up had
descended with a distinctively elephantine effect as Margaret had
observed Certainly the Child Sir Lancelot was at least a sight

It is probable that a great many in that hall must have had even then
a consciousness that they were looking on at History in the Making
A supreme act is recognizable at sight it bears the birthmark of
immortality But Penrod that marvellous boy had begun to declaim even
with the gesture of flinging off his mantle for the accolade

 I first the Child Sir Lancelot du Lake
 Will volunteer to knighthood take
 And kneeling here before your throne
 I vow to

He finished his speech unheard The audience had recovered breath but
had lost selfcontrol and there ensued something later described by a
participant as a sort of cultured riot

The actors in the pageant were not so dumfounded by Penrods costume
as might have been expected A few precocious geniuses perceived
that the overalls were the Child Lancelots own comment on maternal
intentions and these were profoundly impressed they regarded him with
the grisly admiration of young and ambitious criminals for a jailmate
about to be distinguished by hanging But most of the children simply
took it to be the case a little strange but not startling that
Penrods mother had dressed him like thatwhich is pathetic They tried
to go on with the pageant

They made a brief manful effort But the irrepressible outbursts from
the audience bewildered them every time Sir Lancelot du Lake the Child
opened his mouth the great shadowy house fell into an uproar and the
children into confusion Strong women and brave girls in the audience
went out into the lobby shrieking and clinging to one another Others
remained rocking in their seats helpless and spent The neighbourhood
of Mrs Schofield and Margaret became tactfully a desert Friends of
the author went behind the scenes and encountered a hitherto unknown
phase of Mrs Lora Rewbush they said afterward that she hardly seemed
to know what she was doing She begged to be left alone somewhere with
Penrod Schofield for just a little while

They led her away



CHAPTER VI EVENING

The sun was setting behind the back fence though at a considerable
distance as Penrod Schofield approached that fence and looked
thoughtfully up at the top of it apparently having in mind some purpose
to climb up and sit there Debating this he passed his fingers gently
up and down the backs of his legs and then something seemed to decide
him not to sit anywhere He leaned against the fence sighed profoundly
and gazed at Duke his wistful dog

The sigh was reminiscent episodes of simple pathos were passing before
his inward eye About the most painful was the vision of lovely
Marjorie Jones weeping with rage as the Child Sir Lancelot was dragged
insatiate from the prostrate and howling Child Sir Galahad after an
onslaught delivered the precise instant the curtain began to fall upon
the demoralized pageant And thenoh pangs oh womanshe slapped
at the ruffians cheek as he was led past her by a resentful janitor
and turning flung her arms round the Child Sir Galahads neck

PENROD SCHOFIELD DONT YOU DARE EVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN AS LONG AS
YOU LIVE Maurices little white boots and gold tassels had done their
work

At home the late Child Sir Lancelot was consigned to a locked
clothescloset pending the arrival of his father Mr Schofield came
and shortly after there was put into practice an old patriarchal
custom It is a custom of inconceivable antiquity probably primordial
certainly prehistoric but still in vogue in some remaining citadels of
the ancient simplicities of the Republic

And now therefore in the dusk Penrod leaned against the fence and
sighed

His case is comparable to that of an adult who could have survived a
similar experience Looking back to the sawdustbox fancy pictures this
comparable adult a serious and inventive writer engaged in congenial
literary activities in a private retreat We see this period marked
by the creation of some of the most virile passages of a Work dealing
exclusively in red corpuscles and huge primal impulses We see
this thoughtful man dragged from his calm seclusion to a horrifying
publicity forced to adopt the stage and himself a writer compelled
to exploit the repulsive sentiments of an author not only personally
distasteful to him but whose whole method and school in belles lettres
he despises

We see him reduced by desperation and modesty to stealing a pair of
overalls We conceive him to have ruined then his own reputation
and to have utterly disgraced his family next to have engaged in
the duello and to have been spurned by his ladylove thus lost to him
according to her own declaration forever Finally we must behold
imprisonment by the authorities the third degree and flagellation

We conceive our man decided that his career had been perhaps too
eventful Yet Penrod had condensed all of it into eight hours

It appears that he had at least some shadowy perception of a recent
fulness of life for as he leaned against the fence gazing upon his
wistful Duke he sighed again and murmured aloud

WELL HASNT THIS BEEN A DAY

But in a little while a star came out freshly lighted from the highest
part of the sky and Penrod looking up noticed it casually and
a little drowsily He yawned Then he sighed once more but not
reminiscently evening had come the day was over It was a sigh of pure
ennui



CHAPTER VII EVILS OF DRINK

Next day Penrod acquired a dime by a simple and antique process which
was without doubt sometimes practised by the boys of Babylon When the
teacher of his class in Sundayschool requested the weekly contribution
Penrod fumbling honestly at first in the wrong pockets managed to
look so embarrassed that the gentle lady told him not to mind and said
she was often forgetful herself She was so sweet about it that looking
into the future Penrod began to feel confident of a small but regular
income

At the close of the afternoon services he did not go home but proceeded
to squander the funds just withheld from China upon an orgy of the most
pungently forbidden description In a Drug Emporium near the church he
purchased a fivecent sack of candy consisting for the most part of the
heavily flavoured hoofs of horned cattle but undeniably substantial
and so generously capable of resisting solution that the purchaser must
needs be avaricious beyond reason who did not realize his moneys worth

Equipped with this collation Penrod contributed his remaining nickel to
a picture show countenanced upon the seventh day by the legal but not
the moral authorities Here in cozy darkness he placidly insulted his
liver with jawbreaker upon jawbreaker from the paper sack and in a
surfeit of content watched the silent actors on the screen

One film made a lasting impression upon him It depicted with relentless
pathos the drunkards progress beginning with his conversion to beer
in the company of loose travelling men pursuing him through an
inexplicable lapse into evening clothes and the society of some
remarkably painful ladies next exhibiting the effects of alcohol on
the victims domestic disposition the unfortunate man was seen in the
act of striking his wife and subsequently his pleading baby daughter
with an abnormally heavy walkingstick Their flightthrough the
snowto seek the protection of a relative was shown and finally the
drunkards picturesque behaviour at the portals of a madhouse

So fascinated was Penrod that he postponed his departure until this film
came round again by which time he had finished his unnatural repast
and almost but not quite decided against following the profession of a
drunkard when he grew up

Emerging satiated from the theatre a public timepiece before a
jewellers shop confronted him with an unexpected dial and imminent
perplexities How was he to explain at home these hours of dalliance
There was a steadfast rule that he return direct from Sundayschool and
Sunday rules were important because on that day there was his father
always at home and at hand perilously ready for action One of the
hardest conditions of boyhood is the almost continuous strain put upon
the powers of invention by the constant and harassing necessity for
explanations of every natural act

Proceeding homeward through the deepening twilight as rapidly as
possible at a gait half skip and half canter Penrod made up his mind
in what manner he would account for his long delay and as he drew
nearer rehearsed in words the opening passage of his defence

Now see here he determined to begin I do not wished to be blamed
for things I couldnt help nor any other boy I was going along the
street by a cottage and a lady put her head out of the window and said
her husband was drunk and whipping her and her little girl and she
asked me wouldnt I come in and help hold him So I went in and tried to
get hold of this drunken ladys husband where he was whipping their baby
daughter but he wouldnt pay any attention and I TOLD her I ought to
be getting home but she kep on askin me to stay

At this point he reached the corner of his own yard where a coincidence
not only checked the rehearsal of his eloquence but happily obviated all
occasion for it A cab from the station drew up in front of the gate
and there descended a troubled lady in black and a fragile little girl
about three Mrs Schofield rushed from the house and enfolded both in
hospitable arms

They were Penrods Aunt Clara and cousin also Clara from Dayton
Illinois and in the flurry of their arrival everybody forgot to put
Penrod to the question It is doubtful however if he felt any relief
there may have been even a slight unconscious disappointment not
altogether dissimilar to that of an actor deprived of a good part

In the course of some really necessary preparations for dinner he
stepped from the bathroom into the pinkandwhite bedchamber of his
sister and addressed her rather thickly through a towel

Whend mamma find out Aunt Clara and Cousin Clara were coming

Not till she saw them from the window She just happened to look out
as they drove up Aunt Clara telegraphed this morning but it wasnt
delivered

How long they goin to stay

I dont know

Penrod ceased to rub his shining face and thoughtfully tossed the towel
through the bathroom door Uncle John wont try to make em come
back home I guess will he Uncle John was Aunt Claras husband a
successful manufacturer of stoves and his lifelong regret was that he
had not entered the Baptist ministry Hell let em stay here quietly
wont he

What ARE you talking about demanded Margaret turning from her
mirror Uncle John sent them here Why shouldnt he let them stay

Penrod looked crestfallen Then he hasnt taken to drink

Certainly not She emphasized the denial with a pretty peal of soprano
laughter

Then why asked her brother gloomily why did Aunt Clara look so
worried when she got here

Good gracious Dont people worry about anything except somebodys
drinking Where did you get such an idea

Well he persisted you dont KNOW it aint that

She laughed again wholeheartedly Poor Uncle John He wont even allow
grape juice or ginger ale in his house They came because they were
afraid little Clara might catch the measles Shes very delicate and
theres such an epidemic of measles among the children over in Dayton
the schools had to be closed Uncle John got so worried that last night
he dreamed about it and this morning he couldnt stand it any longer
and packed them off over here though he thinks its wicked to travel
on Sunday And Aunt Clara was worried when she got here because theyd
forgotten to check her trunk and it will have to be sent by express Now
what in the name of the common sense put it into your head that Uncle
John had taken to

Oh nothing He turned lifelessly away and went downstairs a newborn
hope dying in his bosom Life seems so needlessly dull sometimes



CHAPTER VIII SCHOOL

Next morning when he had once more resumed the dreadful burden of
education it seemed infinitely duller And yet what pleasanter sight
is there than a schoolroom well filled with children of those sprouting
years just before the teens The casual visitor gazing from the
teachers platform upon these busy little heads needs only a blunted
memory to experience the most agreeable and exhilarating sensations
Still for the greater part the children are unconscious of the
happiness of their condition for nothing is more pathetically true than
that we never know when we are well off The boys in a public school
are less aware of their happy state than are the girls and of all the
boys in his room probably Penrod himself had the least appreciation of
his felicity

He sat staring at an open page of a textbook but not studying not even
reading not even thinking Nor was he lost in a reverie his minds eye
was shut as his physical eye might well have been for the optic nerve
flaccid with ennui conveyed nothing whatever of the printed page
upon which the orb of vision was partially focused Penrod was doing
something very unusual and rare something almost never accomplished
except by coloured people or by a boy in school on a spring day he was
doing really nothing at all He was merely a state of being

From the street a sound stole in through the open window and abhorring
Nature began to fill the vacuum called Penrod Schofield for the sound
was the spring song of a mouthorgan coming down the sidewalk The
windows were intentionally above the level of the eyes of the seated
pupils but the picture of the musician was plain to Penrod painted for
him by a quality in the runs and trills partaking of the oboe of the
calliope and of cats in anguish an excruciating sweetness obtained
only by the wallowing walloping yellowpink palm of a hand whose back
was Congo black and shiny The music came down the street and passed
beneath the window accompanied by the carefree shuffling of a pair of
old shoes scuffing syncopations on the cement sidewalk It passed into
the distance became faint and blurred was gone Emotion stirred in
Penrod a great and poignant desire but perhaps fortunately no fairy
godmother made her appearance

Otherwise Penrod would have gone down the street in a black skin
playing the mouthorgan and an unprepared coloured youth would have
found himself enjoying educational advantages for which he had no
ambition whatever

Roused from perfect apathy the boy cast about the schoolroom an eye
wearied to nausea by the perpetual vision of the neat teacher upon the
platform the backs of the heads of the pupils in front of him and the
monotonous stretches of blackboard threateningly defaced by arithmetical
formulae and other insignia of torture Above the blackboard the
walls of the high room were of white plasterwhite with the qualified
whiteness of old snow in a soft coal town This dismal expanse was
broken by four lithographic portraits votive offerings of a thoughtful
publisher The portraits were of good and great men kind men men
who loved children Their faces were noble and benevolent But the
lithographs offered the only rest for the eyes of children fatigued by
the everlasting sameness of the schoolroom Long day after long day
interminable week in and interminable week out vast month on vast
month the pupils sat with those four portraits beaming kindness down
upon them The faces became permanent in the consciousness of the
children they became an obsessionin and out of school the children
were never free of them The four faces haunted the minds of children
falling asleep they hung upon the minds of children waking at night
they rose forebodingly in the minds of children waking in the morning
they became monstrously alive in the minds of children lying sick of
fever Never while the children of that schoolroom lived would they
be able to forget one detail of the four lithographs the hand of
Longfellow was fixed for them forever in his beard And by a simple
and unconscious association of ideas Penrod Schofield was accumulating
an antipathy for the gentle Longfellow and for James Russell Lowell and
for Oliver Wendell Holmes and for John Greenleaf Whittier which would
never permit him to peruse a work of one of those great New Englanders
without a feeling of personal resentment

His eyes fell slowly and inimically from the brow of Whittier to
the braid of reddish hair belonging to Victorine Riordan the little
octoroon girl who sat directly in front of him Victorines back was as
familiar to Penrod as the necktie of Oliver Wendell Holmes So was her
gayly coloured plaid waist He hated the waist as he hated Victorine
herself without knowing why Enforced companionship in large quantities
and on an equal basis between the sexes appears to sterilize the
affections and schoolroom romances are few

Victorines hair was thick and the brickish glints in it were
beautiful but Penrod was very tired of it A tiny knot of green ribbon
finished off the braid and kept it from unravelling and beneath the
ribbon there was a final wisp of hair which was just long enough to
repose upon Penrods desk when Victorine leaned back in her seat It was
there now Thoughtfully he took the braid between thumb and forefinger
and without disturbing Victorine dipped the end of it and the green
ribbon into the inkwell of his desk He brought hair and ribbon forth
dripping purple ink and partially dried them on a blotter though a
moment later when Victorine leaned forward they were still able to add
a few picturesque touches to the plaid waist

Rudolph Krauss across the aisle from Penrod watched the operation with
protuberant eyes fascinated Inspired to imitation he took a piece of
chalk from his pocket and wrote RATS across the shoulderblades of the
boy in front of him then looked across appealingly to Penrod for tokens
of congratulation Penrod yawned It may not be denied that at times he
appeared to be a very selfcentred boy



CHAPTER IX SOARING

Half the members of the class passed out to a recitationroom the
empurpled Victorine among them and Miss Spence started the remaining
half through the ordeal of trial by mathematics Several boys and girls
were sent to the blackboard and Penrod spared for the moment followed
their operations a little while with his eyes but not with his mind
then sinking deeper in his seat limply abandoned the effort His eyes
remained open but saw nothing the routine of the arithmetic lesson
reached his ears in familiar meaningless sounds but he heard nothing
and yet this time he was profoundly occupied He had drifted away from
the painful land of facts and floated now in a new sea of fancy which
he had just discovered

Maturity forgets the marvellous realness of a boys daydreams how
colourful they glow rosy and living and how opaque the curtain closing
down between the dreamer and the actual world That curtain is almost
soundproof too and causes more throattrouble among parents than is
suspected

The nervous monotony of the schoolroom inspires a sometimes unbearable
longing for something astonishing to happen and as every boys
fundamental desire is to do something astonishing himself so as to be
the centre of all human interest and awe it was natural that Penrod
should discover in fancy the delightful secret of selflevitation
He found in this curious series of imaginings during the lesson in
arithmetic that the atmosphere may be navigated as by a swimmer under
water but with infinitely greater ease and with perfect comfort in
breathing In his mind he extended his arms gracefully at a level with
his shoulders and delicately paddled the air with his hands which at
once caused him to be drawn up out of his seat and elevated gently to a
position about midway between the floor and the ceiling where he
came to an equilibrium and floated a sensation not the less exquisite
because of the screams of his fellow pupils appalled by the miracle
Miss Spence herself was amazed and frightened but he only smiled down
carelessly upon her when she commanded him to return to earth and
then when she climbed upon a desk to pull him down he quietly paddled
himself a little higher leaving his toes just out of her reach Next
he swam through a few slow somersaults to show his mastery of the new
art and with the shouting of the dumfounded scholars ringing in
his ears turned on his side and floated swiftly out of the window
immediately rising above the housetops while people in the street below
him shrieked and a trolley car stopped dead in wonder

With almost no exertion he paddled himself many yards at a stroke to
the girls private school where Marjorie Jones was a pupilMarjorie
Jones of the amber curls and the golden voice Long before the Pageant
of the Table Round she had offered Penrod a hundred proofs that
she considered him wholly undesirable and ineligible At the Friday
Afternoon Dancing Class she consistently incited and led the laughter at
him whenever Professor Bartet singled him out for admonition in matters
of feet and decorum And but yesterday she had chid him for his
slavish lack of memory in daring to offer her a greeting on the way to
Sundayschool Well I expect you must forgot I told you never to speak
to me again If I was a boy Id be too proud to come hanging around
people that dont speak to me even if I WAS the Worst Boy in Town
So she flouted him But now as he floated in through the window of her
classroom and swam gently along the ceiling like an escaped toy balloon
she fell upon her knees beside her little desk and lifting up her arms
toward him cried with love and admiration

Oh PENrod

He negligently kicked a globe from the high chandelier and smiling
coldly floated out through the hall to the front steps of the school
while Marjorie followed imploring him to grant her one kind look

In the street an enormous crowd had gathered headed by Miss Spence and
a brass band and a cheer from a hundred thousand throats shook the
very ground as Penrod swam overhead Marjorie knelt upon the steps
and watched adoringly while Penrod took the drummajors baton and
performing sinuous evolutions above the crowd led the band Then he
threw the baton so high that it disappeared from sight but he went
swiftly after it a double delight for he had not only the delicious
sensation of rocketing safely up and up into the blue sky but also
that of standing in the crowd below watching and admiring himself as he
dwindled to a speck disappeared and then emerging from a cloud came
speeding down with the baton in his hand to the level of the treetops
where he beat time for the band and the vast throng and Marjorie Jones
who all united in the Starspangled Banner in honour of his aerial
achievements It was a great moment

It was a great moment but something seemed to threaten it The face
of Miss Spence looking up from the crowd grew too vividunpleasantly
vivid She was beckoning him and shouting Come down Penrod Schofield
Penrod Schofield come down here

He could hear her above the band and the singing of the multitude she
seemed intent on spoiling everything Marjorie Jones was weeping to
show how sorry she was that she had formerly slighted him and throwing
kisses to prove that she loved him but Miss Spence kept jumping between
him and Marjorie incessantly calling his name

He grew more and more irritated with her he was the most important
person in the world and was engaged in proving it to Marjorie Jones and
the whole city and yet Miss Spence seemed to feel she still had the
right to order him about as she did in the old days when he was an
ordinary schoolboy He was furious he was sure she wanted him to do
something disagreeable It seemed to him that she had screamed Penrod
Schofield thousands of times

From the beginning of his aerial experiments in his own schoolroom he
had not opened his lips knowing somehow that one of the requirements
for air floating is perfect silence on the part of the floater but
finally irritated beyond measure by Miss Spences clamorous insistence
he was unable to restrain an indignant rebuke and immediately came to
earth with a frightful bump

Miss Spencein the fleshhad directed toward the physical body of the
absent Penrod an inquiry as to the fractional consequences of dividing
seventeen apples fairly among three boys and she was surprised and
displeased to receive no answer although to the best of her knowledge
and belief he was looking fixedly at her She repeated her question
crisply without visible effect then summoned him by name with
increasing asperity Twice she called him while all his fellow
pupils turned to stare at the gazing boy She advanced a step from the
platform

Penrod Schofield

Oh my goodness he shouted suddenly Cant you keep still a MINUTE



CHAPTER X UNCLE JOHN

Miss Spence gasped So did the pupils

The whole room filled with a swelling conglomerate OOOOH

As for Penrod himself the walls reeled with the shock He sat with his
mouth open a mere lump of stupefaction For the appalling words that
he had hurled at the teacher were as inexplicable to him as to any other
who heard them

Nothing is more treacherous than the human mind nothing else so loves
to play the Iscariot Even when patiently bullied into a semblance of
order and training it may prove but a base and shifty servant And
Penrods mind was not his servant it was a master with the April
winds whims and it had just played him a diabolical trick The very
jolt with which he came back to the schoolroom in the midst of his
fancied flight jarred his daydream utterly out of him and he sat
openmouthed in horror at what he had said

The unanimous gasp of awe was protracted Miss Spence however finally
recovered her breath and returning deliberately to the platform faced
the school And then for a little while as pathetic stories sometimes
recount everything was very still It was so still in fact that
Penrods newborn notoriety could almost be heard growing This grisly
silence was at last broken by the teacher

Penrod Schofield stand up

The miserable child obeyed

What did you mean by speaking to me in that way

He hung his head raked the floor with the side of his shoe swayed
swallowed looked suddenly at his hands with the air of never having
seen them before then clasped them behind him The school shivered in
ecstatic horror every fascinated eye upon him yet there was not a
soul in the room but was profoundly grateful to him for the
sensationincluding the offended teacher herself Unhappily all this
gratitude was unconscious and altogether different from the kind which
results in testimonials and lovingcups On the contrary

Penrod Schofield

He gulped

Answer me at once Why did you speak to me like that

I was He choked unable to continue

Speak out

I was justthinking he managed to stammer

That will not do she returned sharply I wish to know immediately
why you spoke as you did

The stricken Penrod answered helplessly

Because I was just thinking

Upon the very rack he could have offered no ampler truthful explanation
It was all he knew about it

Thinking what

Just thinking

Miss Spences expression gave evidence that her power of selfrestraint
was undergoing a remarkable test However after taking counsel with
herself she commanded

Come here

He shuffled forward and she placed a chair upon the platform near her
own

Sit there

Then but not at all as if nothing had happened she continued the
lesson in arithmetic Spiritually the children may have learned a lesson
in very small fractions indeed as they gazed at the fragment of
sin before them on the stool of penitence They all stared at him
attentively with hard and passionately interested eyes in which there
was never one trace of pity It cannot be said with precision that he
writhed his movement was more a slow continuous squirm effected with
a ghastly assumption of languid indifference while his gaze in the
effort to escape the marblehearted glare of his schoolmates affixed
itself with apparent permanence to the waistcoat button of James Russell
Lowell just above the U in Russell

Classes came and classes went grilling him with eyes Newcomers
received the story of the crime in darkling whispers and the outcast
sat and sat and sat and squirmed and squirmed and squirmed He did one
or two things with his spine which a professional contortionist would
have observed with real interest And all this while of freezing
suspense was but the criminals detention awaiting trial A known
punishment may be anticipated with some measure of equanimity at least
the prisoner may prepare himself to undergo it but the unknown looms
more monstrous for every attempt to guess it Penrods crime was unique
there were no rules to aid him in estimating the vengeance to fall upon
him for it What seemed most probable was that he would be expelled from
the schools in the presence of his family the mayor and council and
afterward whipped by his father upon the State House steps with the
entire city as audience by invitation of the authorities

Noon came The rows of children filed out every head turning for a last
unpleasingly speculative look at the outlaw Then Miss Spence closed the
door into the cloakroom and that into the big hall and came and sat at
her desk near Penrod The tramping of feet outside the shrill calls
and shouting and the changing voices of the older boys ceased to be
heardand there was silence Penrod still affecting to be occupied
with Lowell was conscious that Miss Spence looked at him intently

Penrod she said gravely what excuse have you to offer before I
report your case to the principal

The word principal struck him to the vitals Grand Inquisitor Grand
Khan Sultan Emperor Tsar Caesar Augustusthese are comparable He
stopped squirming instantly and sat rigid

I want an answer Why did you shout those words at me

Well he murmured I was justthinking

Thinking what she asked sharply

I dont know

That wont do

He took his left ankle in his right hand and regarded it helplessly

That wont do Penrod Schofield she repeated severely If that is
all the excuse you have to offer I shall report your case this instant

And she rose with fatal intent

But Penrod was one of those whom the precipice inspires Well I HAVE
got an excuse

Wellshe paused impatientlywhat is it

He had not an idea but he felt one coming and replied automatically
in a plaintive tone

I guess anybody that had been through what I had to go through last
night would think they had an excuse

Miss Spence resumed her seat though with the air of being ready to leap
from it instantly

What has last night to do with your insolence to me this morning

Well I guess youd see he returned emphasizing the plaintive note
if you knew what I know

Now Penrod she said in a kinder voice I have a high regard for
your mother and father and it would hurt me to distress them but you
must either tell me what was the matter with you or Ill have to take
you to Mrs Houston

Well aint I going to he cried spurred by the dread name Its
because I didnt sleep last night

Were you ill The question was put with some dryness

He felt the dryness Nom _I_ wasnt

Then if someone in your family was so ill that even you were kept up
all night how does it happen they let you come to school this morning

It wasnt illness he returned shaking his head mournfully It was
lots worsen anybodys being sick It wasit waswell it was jest
awful

WHAT was He remarked with anxiety the incredulity in her tone

It was about Aunt Clara he said

Your Aunt Clara she repeated Do you mean your mothers sister who
married Mr Farry of Dayton Illinois

YesUncle John returned Penrod sorrowfully The trouble was about
him

Miss Spence frowned a frown which he rightly interpreted as one of
continued suspicion She and I were in school together she said I
used to know her very well and Ive always heard her married life was
entirely happy I dont

Yes it was he interrupted until last year when Uncle John took to
running with travelling men

What

Yesm He nodded solemnly That was what started it At first he was
a good kind husband but these travelling men would coax him into a
saloon on his way home from work and they got him to drinking beer and
then ales wines liquors and cigars

Penrod

Maam

Im not inquiring into your Aunt Claras private affairs Im asking
you if you have anything to say which would palliate

Thats what Im tryin to TELL you about Miss Spence he
pleadedif youd jest only let me When Aunt Clara and her little
baby daughter got to our house last night

You say Mrs Farry is visiting your mother

Yesmnot just visitingyou see she HAD to come Well of course
little baby Clara she was so bruised up and mauled where hed been
hittin her with his cane

You mean that your uncle had done such a thing as THAT exclaimed Miss
Spence suddenly disarmed by this scandal

Yesm and mamma and Margaret had to sit up all night nursin little
Claraand AUNT Clara was in such a state SOMEBODY had to keep talkin
to HER and there wasnt anybody but me to do it so I

But where was your father she cried

Maam

Where was your father while

Ohpapa Penrod paused reflected then brightened Why he was down
at the train waitin to see if Uncle John would try to follow em and
make em come home sos he could persecute em some more I wanted to do
that but they said if he did come I mightnt be strong enough to
hold him and The brave lad paused again modestly Miss Spences
expression was encouraging Her eyes were wide with astonishment and
there may have been in them also the mingled beginnings of admiration
and selfreproach Penrod warming to his work felt safer every moment

And so he continued I had to sit up with Aunt Clara She had some
pretty big bruises too and I had to

But why didnt they send for a doctor However this question was only
a flicker of dying incredulity

Oh they didnt want any DOCTOR exclaimed the inspired realist
promptly They dont want anybody to HEAR about it because Uncle John
might reformand then whered he be if everybody knew hed been a
drunkard and whipped his wife and baby daughter

Oh said Miss Spence

You see he used to be upright as anybody he went on explanatively
It all begun

Began Penrod

Yesm It all commenced from the first day he let those travelling men
coax him into the saloon Penrod narrated the downfall of his Uncle
John at length In detail he was nothing short of plethoric and
incident followed incident sketched with such vividness such abundance
of colour and such verisimilitude to a drunkards life as a drunkards
life should be that had Miss Spence possessed the rather chilling
attributes of William J Burns himself the last trace of skepticism
must have vanished from her mind Besides there are two things that
will be believed of any man whatsoever and one of them is that he has
taken to drink And in every sense it was a moving picture which with
simple but eloquent words the virtuous Penrod set before his teacher

His eloquence increased with what it fed on and as with the eloquence
so with selfreproach in the gentle bosom of the teacher She cleared
her throat with difficulty once or twice during his description of his
ministering night with Aunt Clara And I said to her Why Aunt Clara
whats the use of takin on so about it And I said Now Aunt Clara
all the crying in the world cant make things any better And then
shed just keep catchin hold of me and sob and kind of holler and Id
say DONT cry Aunt ClaraPLEASE dont cry

Then under the influence of some fragmentary survivals of the
respectable portion of his Sunday adventures his theme became more
exalted and only partially misquoting a phrase from a psalm he
related how he had made it of comfort to Aunt Clara and how he had
besought her to seek Higher guidance in her trouble

The surprising thing about a structure such as Penrod was erecting is
that the taller it becomes the more ornamentation it will stand Gifted
boys have this faculty of building magnificence upon cobwebsand Penrod
was gifted Under the spell of his really great performance Miss Spence
gazed more and more sweetly upon the prodigy of spiritual beauty and
goodness before her until at last when Penrod came to the explanation
of his just thinking she was forced to turn her head away

You mean dear she said gently that you were all worn out and
hardly knew what you were saying

Yesm

And you were thinking about all those dreadful things so hard that you
forgot where you were

I was thinking he said simply how to save Uncle John

And the end of it for this mighty boy was that the teacher kissed him



CHAPTER XI FIDELITY OF A LITTLE DOG

The returning students that afternoon observed that Penrods desk was
vacantand nothing could have been more impressive than that sinister
mere emptiness The accepted theory was that Penrod had been arrested
How breathtaking then the sensation when at the beginning of the
second hour he strolledin with inimitable carelessness and rubbing
his eyes somewhat noticeably in the manner of one who has snatched an
hour of much needed sleep took his place as if nothing in particular
had happened This at first supposed to be a superhuman exhibition
of sheer audacity became but the more dumfounding when Miss
Spencelooking up from her deskgreeted him with a pleasant little
nod Even after school Penrod gave numerous maddened investigators no
relief All he would consent to say was

Oh I just TALKED to her

A mystification not entirely unconnected with the one thus produced was
manifested at his own family dinnertable the following evening Aunt
Clara had been out rather late and came to the table after the rest
were seated She wore a puzzled expression

Do you ever see Mary Spence nowadays she inquired as she unfolded
her napkin addressing Mrs Schofield Penrod abruptly set down his
soupspoon and gazed at his aunt with flattering attention

Yes sometimes said Mrs Schofield Shes Penrods teacher

Is she said Mrs Farry Do you She paused Do people think her a
littlequeer these days

Why no returned her sister What makes you say that

She has acquired a very odd manner said Mrs Farry decidedly At
least she seemed odd to ME I met her at the corner just before I got
to the house a few minutes ago and after wed said howdydo to each
other she kept hold of my hand and looked as though she was going to
cry She seemed to be trying to say something and choking

But I dont think thats so very queer Clara She knew you in school
didnt she

Yes but

And she hadnt seen you for so many years I think its perfectly
natural she

Wait She stood there squeezing my hand and struggling to get her
voiceand I got really embarrassedand then finally she said in a
kind of tearful whisper Be of good cheerthis trial will pass

How queer exclaimed Margaret

Penrod sighed and returned somewhat absently to his soup

Well I dont know said Mrs Schofield thoughtfully Of course shes
heard about the outbreak of measles in Dayton since they had to close
the schools and she knows you live there

But doesnt it seem a VERY exaggerated way suggested Margaret to
talk about measles

Wait begged Aunt Clara After she said that she said something even
queerer and then put her handkerchief to her eyes and hurried away

Penrod laid down his spoon again and moved his chair slightly back from
the table A spirit of prophecy was upon him he knew that someone was
going to ask a question which he felt might better remain unspoken

What WAS the other thing she said Mr Schofield inquired thus
immediately fulfilling his sons premonition

She said returned Mrs Farry slowly looking about the table she
said I know that Penrod is a great great comfort to you

There was a general exclamation of surprise It was a singular thing
and in no manner may it be considered complimentary to Penrod that this
speech of Miss Spences should have immediately confirmed Mrs Farrys
doubts about her in the minds of all his family

Mr Schofield shook his head pityingly

Im afraid shes a goner he went so far as to say

Of all the weird ideas cried Margaret

I never heard anything like it in my life Mrs Schofield exclaimed
Was that ALL she said

Every word

Penrod again resumed attention to his soup His mother looked at him
curiously and then struck by a sudden thought gathered the glances of
the adults of the table by a significant movement of the head and by
another conveyed an admonition to drop the subject until later Miss
Spence was Penrods teacher it was better for many reasons not
to discuss the subject of her queerness before him This was Mrs
Schofields thought at the time Later she had another and it kept her
awake

The next afternoon Mr Schofield returning at five oclock from the
cares of the day found the house deserted and sat down to read his
evening paper in what appeared to be an uninhabited apartment known to
its own world as the drawingroom A sneeze unexpected both to him
and the owner informed him of the presence of another person

Where are you Penrod the parent asked looking about

Here said Penrod meekly

Stooping Mr Schofield discovered his son squatting under the piano
near an open windowhis wistful Duke lying beside him

What are you doing there

Me

Why under the piano

Well the boy returned with grave sweetness I was just kind of
sitting herethinking

All right Mr Schofield rather touched returned to the digestion of
a murder his back once more to the piano and Penrod silently drew
from beneath his jacket where he had slipped it simultaneously with
the sneeze a paperbacked volume entitled Slimsy the Sioux City
Squealer or Not Guilty Your Honor

In this manner the readingclub continued in peace absorbed contented
the world well forgotuntil a sudden violently irritated slambang of
the front door startled the members and Mrs Schofield burst into the
room and threw herself into a chair moaning

Whats the matter mamma asked her husband laying aside his paper

Henry Passloe Schofield returned the lady I dont know what IS to
be done with that boy I do NOT

You mean Penrod

Who else could I mean She sat up exasperated to stare at him
Henry Passloe Schofield youve got to take this matter in your
handsits beyond me

Well what has he

Last night I got to thinking she began rapidly about what Clara
told usthank Heaven she and Margaret and little Clara have gone to tea
at Cousin Charlottesbut theyll be home soonabout what she said
about Miss Spence

You mean about Penrods being a comfort

Yes and I kept thinking and thinking and thinking about it till I
couldnt stand it any

By GEORGE shouted Mr Schofield startlingly stooping to look
under the piano A statement that he had suddenly remembered his sons
presence would be lacking in accuracy for the highly sensitized Penrod
was in fact no longer present No more was Duke his faithful dog

Whats the matter

Nothing he returned striding to the open window and looking out Go
on

Oh she moaned it must be kept from Claraand Ill never hold up my
head again if John Farry ever hears of it

Hears of WHAT

Well I just couldnt stand it I got so curious and I thought of
course if Miss Spence HAD become a little unbalanced it was my duty to
know it as Penrods mother and she his teacher so I thought I would
just call on her at her apartment after school and have a chat and see
and I did andoh

Well

Ive just come from there and she told meshe told me Oh Ive NEVER
known anything like this

WHAT did she tell you

Mrs Schofield making a great effort managed to assume a temporary
appearance of calm Henry she said solemnly bear this in mind
whatever you do to Penrod it must be done in some place when Clara
wont hear it But the first thing to do is to find him

Within view of the window from which Mr Schofield was gazing was the
closed door of the storeroom in the stable and just outside this door
Duke was performing a most engaging trick

His young master had taught Duke to sit up and beg when he wanted
anything and if that didnt get it to speak Duke was facing the
closed door and sitting up and begging and now he also spokein a
loud clear bark

There was an open transom over the door and from this descendedhurled
by an unseen agencya can half filled with old paint

It caught the small besieger of the door on his thoroughly surprised
right ear encouraged him to some remarkable acrobatics and turned
large portions of him a dull blue Allowing only a moment to perplexity
and deciding after a single and evidently unappetizing experiment
not to cleanse himself of paint the loyal animal resumed his quaint
upright posture

Mr Schofield seated himself on the windowsill whence he could keep in
view that pathetic picture of unrequited love

Go on with your story mamma he said I think I can find Penrod when
we want him

And a few minutes later he added And I think I know the place to do it
in

Again the faithful voice of Duke was heard pleading outside the bolted
door



CHAPTER XII MISS RENNSDALE ACCEPTS

Onetwothree onetwothreeglide said Professor Bartet
emphasizing his instructions by a brisk collision of his palms at
glide Onetwothree onetwothreeglide

The school week was over at last but Penrods troubles were not

Round and round the ballroom went the seventeen struggling little
couples of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class Round and round went
their reflections with them swimming rhythmically in the polished dark
floorwhite and blue and pink for the girls black with dabs of white
for the whitecollared whitegloved boys and sparks and slivers
of high light everywhere as the glistening pumps flickered along the
surface like a school of flying fish Every small pink facewith one
exceptionwas painstaking and set for duty It was a conscientious
little merrygoround

Onetwothree onetwothreeglide Onetwothree
onetwothreeglide OnetwothHa Mister Penrod Schofield you lose
the step Your left foot No no This is the left Seelike me Now
again Onetwothree onetwothreeglide Better Much better Again
Onetwothree onetwothreeglStop Mr Penrod Schofield this
dancing class is provided by the kind parents of the pupilses as much
to learn the mannerss of good societies as to dance You think you shall
ever see a gentleman in good societies to tickle his partner in the
dance till she say Ouch Never I assure you it is not done Again Now
then Piano please Onetwothree onetwothreeglide Mr Penrod
Schofield your right footyour right foot No no Stop

The merrygoround came to a standstill

Mr Penrod Schofield and partnerProfessor Bartet wiped his
browwill you kindly observe me Onetwothreeglide So Now
thenno you will please keep your places ladies and gentlemen Mr
Penrod Schofield I would puttickly like your attention this is for
you

Pickin on me again murmured the smouldering Penrod to his small
unsympathetic partner Cant let me alone a minute

Mister Georgie Bassett please step to the centre said the professor

Mr Bassett complied with modest alacrity

Teachers pet whispered Penrod hoarsely He had nothing but contempt
for Georgie Bassett The parents guardians aunts uncles cousins
governesses housemaids cooks chauffeurs and coachmen appertaining to
the members of the dancing class all dwelt in the same part of town and
shared certain communal theories and among the most firmly established
was that which maintained Georgie Bassett to be the Best Boy in Town
Contrariwise the unfortunate Penrod largely because of his recent
dazzling but disastrous attempts to control forces far beyond him
had been given a clear title as the Worst Boy in Town Population
135000 To precisely what degree his reputation was the product of
his own energies cannot be calculated It was Marjorie Jones who first
applied the description in its definite simplicity the day after the
pageant and possibly her frequent and effusive repetitions of it
even upon wholly irrelevant occasions had something to do with its
prompt and quite perfect acceptance by the community

Miss Rennsdale will please do me the fafer to be Mr Georgie Bassetts
partner for one moment said Professor Bartet Mr Penrod Schofield
will please give his attention Miss Rennsdale and Mister Bassett
obliche me if you please Others please watch Piano please Now
then

Miss Rennsdale aged eightthe youngest lady in the classand Mr
Georgie Bassett onetwothreeglided with consummate technique for the
better education of Penrod Schofield It is possible that ambercurled
beautiful Marjorie felt that she rather than Miss Rennsdale might have
been selected as the example of perfectionor perhaps her remark was
only woman

Stopping everybody for that boy said Marjorie

Penrod across the circle from her heard distinctlynay he was
obviously intended to hear but over a scorched heart he preserved a
stoic front Whereupon Marjorie whispered derisively in the ear of her
partner Maurice Levy who wore a pearl pin in his tie

Again please everybodyladies and gentlemen cried Professor
Bartet Mister Penrod Schofield if you please pay puttickly
attention Piano please Now then

The lesson proceeded At the close of the hour Professor Bartet stepped
to the centre of the room and clapped his hands for attention

Ladies and gentlemen if you please to seat yourselves quietly he
said I speak to you now about tomorrow As you all knowMister
Penrod Schofield I am not sticking up in a tree outside that window If
you do me the fafer to examine I am here insides of the room Now then
Piano plno I do not wish the piano As you all know this is the
last lesson of the season until next October Tomorrow is our special
afternoon beginning three oclock we dance the cotillon But this
afternoon comes the test of mannerss You must see if each know how to
make a little formal call like a grownup people in good societies You
have had good perfect instruction let us see if we know how to perform
like societies ladies and gentlemen twentysix years of age

Now when youre dismissed each lady will go to her home and prepare to
receive a call The gentlemen will allow the ladies time to reach their
houses and to prepare to receive callers then each gentleman will call
upon a lady and beg the pleasure to engage her for a partner in the
cotillon tomorrow You all know the correct proper form for these
calls because didnt I work teaching you last lesson till I thought
I would drop dead Yes Now each gentleman if he reach a ladys house
behind someother gentleman then he must go somewhere else to a ladys
house and keep calling until he secures a partner so as there are the
same number of both everybody shall have a partner

Now please all remember that if in caseMister Penrod Schofield when
you make your call on a lady I beg you to please remember that gentlemen
in good societies do not scratch the back in societies as you appear to
attempt so please allow the hands to rest carelessly in the lap Now
please all remember that if in caseMister Penrod Schofield if you
please Gentlemen in societies do not scratch the back by causing
frictions between it and the back of your chair either Nobody else is
itching here _I_ do not itch I cannot talk if you must itch In the
name of Heaven why must you always itch What was I saying Where ah
the cotillonyes For the cotillon it is important nobody shall fail
to be here tomorrow but if any one should be so very ill he cannot
possible come he must write a very polite note of regrets in the form
of good societies to his engaged partner to excuse himselfand he must
give the reason

I do not think anybody is going to be that sick tomorrowno and I
will find out and report to parents if anybody would try it and not be
But it is important for the cotillon that we have an even number of so
many couples and if it should happen that someone comes and her partner
has sent her a polite note that he has genuine reasons why he cannot
come the note must be handed at once to me so that I arrange some
other partner Is all understood Yes The gentlemen will remember now
to allow the ladies plenty of time to reach their houses and prepare
to receive calls Ladies and gentlemen I thank you for your polite
attention

It was nine blocks to the house of Marjorie Jones but Penrod did it in
less than seven minutes from a flying startsuch was his haste to lay
himself and his hand for the cotillon at the feet of one who had so
recently spoken unamiably of him in public He had not yet learned that
the only safe male rebuke to a scornful female is to stay away from
herespecially if that is what she desires However he did not wish
to rebuke her simply and ardently he wished to dance the cotillon with
her Resentment was swallowed up in hope

The fact that Miss Jones feeling for him bore a striking resemblance to
that of Simon Legree for Uncle Tom deterred him not at all Naturally
he was not wholly unconscious that when he should lay his hand for the
cotillon at her feet it would be her inward desire to step on it but
he believed that if he were first in the field Marjorie would have to
accept These things are governed by law

It was his fond intention to reach her house even in advance of herself
and with grave misgiving he beheld a large automobile at rest before the
sainted gate Forthwith a sinking feeling became a portent inside him
as little Maurice Levy emerged from the front door of the house

Lo Penrod said Maurice airily

What you doin in there inquired Penrod

In where

In Marjories

Well what shouldnt I be doin in Marjories Mr Levy returned
indignantly I was inviting her for my partner in the cotillonwhat
you spose

You havent got any right to Penrod protested hotly You cant do it
yet

I did do it yet said Maurice

You cant insisted Penrod You got to allow them time first He said
the ladies had to be allowed time to prepare

Well aint she had time to prepare

When Penrod demanded stepping close to his rival threateningly Id
like to know when

When echoed the other with shrill triumph When Why in mammas
sixtyhorse powder limousine automobile what Marjorie came home with me
in I guess thats when

An impulse in the direction of violence became visible upon the
countenance of Penrod

I expect you need some wiping down he began dangerously Ill give
you sumpthing to remem

Oh you will Maurice cried with astonishing truculence contorting
himself into what he may have considered a posture of defense Lets
see you try it youyou itcher

For the moment defiance from such a source was dumfounding Then
luckily Penrod recollected something and glanced at the automobile

Perceiving therein not only the alert chauffeur but the magnificent
outlines of Mrs Levy his enemys mother he manoeuvred his lifted hand
so that it seemed he had but meant to scratch his ear

Well I guess I better be goin he said casually See you tomorrow

Maurice mounted to the lap of luxury and Penrod strolled away with an
assumption of careless ease which was put to a severe strain when from
the rear window of the car a sudden protuberance in the nature of a
small dark curly head shrieked scornfully

Go onyou big stiff

The cotillon loomed dismally before Penrod now but it was his duty
to secure a partner and he set about it with a dreary heart The delay
occasioned by his fruitless attempt on Marjorie and the altercation with
his enemy at her gate had allowed other ladies ample time to prepare for
callersand to receive them Sadly he went from house to house finding
that he had been preceded in one after the other Altogether his
hand for the cotillon was declined eleven times that afternoon on the
legitimate ground of previous engagement This with Marjorie scored
off all except five of the seventeen possible partners and four of the
five were also sealed away from him as he learned in chance encounters
with other boys upon the street

One lady alone remained he bowed to the inevitable and entered this
lorn damsels gate at twilight with an air of great discouragement The
lorn damsel was Miss Rennsdale aged eight

We are apt to forget that there are actually times of life when too much
youth is a handicap Miss Rennsdale was beautiful she danced like a
premiere she had every charm but age On that account alone had she
been allowed so much time to prepare to receive callers that it was only
by the most manful efforts she could keep her lip from trembling

A decorous maid conducted the longbelated applicant to her where she
sat upon a sofa beside a nursery governess The decorous maid announced
him composedly as he made his entrance

Mr Penrod Schofield

Miss Rennsdale suddenly burst into loud sobs

Oh she wailed I just knew it would be him

The decorous maids composure vanished at oncelikewise her decorum
She clapped her hand over her mouth and fled uttering sounds The
governess however set herself to comfort her heartbroken charge and
presently succeeded in restoring Miss Rennsdale to a semblance of that
poise with which a lady receives callers and accepts invitations to
dance cotillons But she continued to sob at intervals

Feeling himself at perhaps a disadvantage Penrod made offer of his
hand for the morrow with a little embarrassment Following the form
prescribed by Professor Bartet he advanced several paces toward the
stricken lady and bowed formally

I hope he said by rote youre well and your parents also in good
health May I have the pleasure of dancing the cotillon as your partner
tmorrow afternoon

The wet eyes of Miss Rennsdale searched his countenance without
pleasure and a shudder wrung her small shoulders but the governess
whispered to her instructively and she made a great effort

I thuthank you fufor your polite invuinvuinvutation and I ac
Thus far she progressed when emotion overcame her again She beat
frantically upon the sofa with fists and heels Oh I DID want it to be
Georgie Bassett

No no no said the governess and whispered urgently whereupon Miss
Rennsdale was able to complete her acceptance

And I acaccept wuwith pupleasure she moaned and immediately
uttering a loud yell flung herself face downward upon the sofa
clutching her governess convulsively

Somewhat disconcerted Penrod bowed again

I thank you for your polite acceptance he murmured hurriedly and
I trustI trustI forget Oh yesI trust we shall have a most
enjoyable occasion Pray present my compliments to your parents and I
must now wish you a very good afternoon

Concluding these courtly demonstrations with another bow he withdrew in
fair order though thrown into partial confusion in the hall by a final
wail from his crushed hostess

Oh Why couldnt it be anybody but HIM



CHAPTER XIII THE SMALLPOX MEDICINE

Next morning Penrod woke in profound depression of spirit the cotillon
ominous before him He pictured Marjorie Jones and Maurice graceful and
lighthearted flitting by him fairylike loosing silvery laughter upon
him as he engaged in the struggle to keep step with a partner about four
years and two feet his junior It was hard enough for Penrod to keep
step with a girl of his size

The foreboding vision remained with him increasing in vividness
throughout the forenoon He found himself unable to fix his mind
upon anything else and having bent his gloomy footsteps toward the
sawdustbox after breakfast presently descended therefrom abandoning
Harold Ramorez where he had left him the preceding Saturday Then as he
sat communing silently with wistful Duke in the storeroom coquettish
fortune looked his way

It was the habit of Penrods mother not to throw away anything
whatsoever until years of storage conclusively proved there would never
be a use for it but a recent housecleaning had ejected upon the back
porch a great quantity of bottles and other paraphernalia of medicine
left over from illnesses in the family during a period of several years
This debris Della the cook had collected in a large market basket
adding to it some bottles of flavouring extracts that had proved
unpopular in the household also old catsup bottles a jar or two of
preserves gone bad various rejected dental liquidsand other things
And she carried the basket out to the storeroom in the stable

Penrod was at first unaware of what lay before him Chin on palms he
sat upon the iron rim of a former aquarium and stared morbidly through
the open door at the checkered departing back of Della It was another
who saw treasure in the basket she had left

Mr Samuel Williams aged eleven and congenial to Penrod in years
sex and disposition appeared in the doorway shaking into foam a black
liquid within a pint bottle stoppered by a thumb

Yay Penrod the visitor gave greeting

Yay said Penrod with slight enthusiasm What you got

Lickrish water

Drinkins demanded Penrod promptly This is equivalent to the cry of
Biters when an apple is shown and establishes unquestionable title

Down to there stipulated Sam removing his thumb to affix it firmly
as a mark upon the side of the bottle a check upon gormandizing that
remained carefully in place while Penrod drank

This rite concluded the visitors eye fell upon the basket deposited by
Della He emitted tokens of pleasure

Looky Looky Looky there That aint any good pile o stuffoh no

What for

Drug store shouted Sam Well be partners

Or else Penrod suggested Ill run the drug store and you be a
customer

No Partners insisted Sam with such conviction that his host yielded
and within ten minutes the drug store was doing a heavy business with
imaginary patrons Improvising counters with boards and boxes and
setting forth a very druggishlooking stock from the basket each of the
partners found occupation to his tastePenrod as salesman and Sam as
prescription clerk

Here you are madam said Penrod briskly offering a vial of Sams
mixing to an invisible matron This will cure your husband in a few
minutes Heres the camphor mister Call again Fifty cents worth of
pills Yes madam There you are Hurry up with that dose for the nigger
lady Bill

Ill tend to it soons I get time Jim replied the prescription
clerk Im busy fixin the smallpox medicine for the sick policeman
downtown

Penrod stopped sales to watch this operation Sam had found an empty
pint bottle and with the pursed lips and measuring eye of a great
chemist was engaged in filling it from other bottles

First he poured into it some of the syrup from the condemned preserves
and a quantity of extinct hair oil next the remaining contents of a
dozen small vials cryptically labelled with physicians prescriptions
then some remnants of catsup and essence of beef and what was left
in several bottles of mouthwash after that a quantity of rejected
flavouring extracttopping off by shaking into the mouth of the
bottle various powders from small pink papers relics of Mr Schofields
influenza of the preceding winter

Sam examined the combination with concern appearing unsatisfied We
got to make that smallpox medicine good and strong he remarked and
his artistic sense growing more powerful than his appetite he poured
about a quarter of the licorice water into the smallpox medicine

What you doin protested Penrod What you want to waste that
lickrish water for We ought to keep it to drink when were tired

I guess I got a right to use my own lickrish water any way I want to
replied the prescription clerk I tell you you cant get smallpox
medicine too strong Look at her now He held the bottle up admiringly
Shes as black as lickrish I bet you shes strong all right

I wonder how she tastes said Penrod thoughtfully

Dont smell so awful much observed Sam sniffing the bottlea good
deal though

I wonder if itd make us sick to drink it said Penrod

Sam looked at the bottle thoughtfully then his eye wandering fell
upon Duke placidly curled up near the door and lighted with the advent
of an idea new to him but old old in the worldolder than Egypt

Lets give Duke some he cried

That was the spark They acted immediately and a minute later Duke
released from custody with a competent potion of the smallpox medicine
inside him settled conclusively their doubts concerning its effect The
patient animal accustomed to expect the worst at all times walked out
of the door shaking his head with an air of considerable annoyance
opening and closing his mouth with singular energyand so repeatedly
that they began to count the number of times he did it Sam thought it
was thirtynine times but Penrod had counted fortyone before other and
more striking symptoms appeared

All things come from Mother Earth and must returnDuke restored much
at this time Afterward he ate heartily of grass and then over his
shoulder he bent upon his master one inscrutable look and departed
feebly to the front yard

The two boys had watched the process with warm interest I told you she
was strong said Mr Williams proudly

Yes sirshe is Penrod was generous enough to admit I expect shes
strong enough He paused in thought and added

We havent got a horse any more

I bet you shed fix him if you had said Sam And it may be that this
was no idle boast

The pharmaceutical game was not resumed the experiment upon Duke had
made the drug store commonplace and stimulated the appetite for stronger
meat Lounging in the doorway the nearvivisectionists sipped licorice
water alternately and conversed

I bet some of our smallpox medicine would fix ole Pfessor Bartet all
right quoth Penrod I wish hed come along and ask us for some

We could tell him it was lickrish water added Sam liking the idea
The two bottles look almost the same

Then we wouldnt have to go to his ole cotillon this afternoon Penrod
sighed There wouldnt be any

Whos your partner Pen

Whos yours

Whos yours I just ast you

Oh shes all right And Penrod smiled boastfully

I bet you wanted to dance with Marjorie said his friend

Me I wouldnt dance with that girl if she begged me to I wouldnt
dance with her to save her from drowning I wouldnt da

Oh noyou wouldnt interrupted Mr Williams skeptically

Penrod changed his tone and became persuasive

Looky here Sam he said confidentially Ive got a mighty nice
partner but my mother dont like her mother and so Ive been thinking
I better not dance with her Ill tell you what Ill do Ive got a
mighty good sling in the house and Ill give it to you if youll change
partners

You want to change and you dont even know who mine is said Sam and
he made the simple though precocious deduction Yours must be a lala
Well I invited Mabel Rorebeck and she wouldnt let me change if
I wanted to Mabel Rorebeckd rather dance with me he continued
serenely than anybody and she said she was awful afraid youd ast
her But I aint goin to dance with Mabel after all because this
morning she sent me a note about her uncle died last nightand Pfessor
Bartetll have to find me a partner after I get there Anyway I bet you
havent got any slingand I bet your partners Baby Rennsdale

What if she is said Penrod Shes good enough for ME This speech
held not so much modesty in solution as intended praise of the lady
Taken literally however it was an understatement of the facts and
wholly insincere

Yay jeered Mr Williams upon whom his friends hypocrisy was quite
wasted How can your mother not like her mother Baby Rennsdale hasnt
got any mother You and herll be a sight

That was Penrods own conviction and with this corroboration of it
he grew so spiritless that he could offer no retort He slid to a
despondent sitting posture upon the door sill and gazed wretchedly upon
the ground while his companion went to replenish the licorice water at
the hydrantenfeebling the potency of the liquor no doubt but making
up for that in quantity

Your mother goin with you to the cotillon asked Sam when he
returned

No Shes goin to meet me there Shes goin somewhere first

Sos mine said Sam Ill come by for you

All right

I better go before long Noon whistles been blowin

All right Penrod repeated dully

Sam turned to go but paused A new straw hat was peregrinating along
the fence near the two boys This hat belonged to someone passing upon
the sidewalk of the crossstreet and the someone was Maurice Levy
Even as they stared he halted and regarded them over the fence with two
small dark eyes

Fate had brought about this moment and this confrontation



CHAPTER XIV MAURICE LEVYS CONSTITUTION

Lo Sam said Maurice cautiously What you doin

Penrod at that instant had a singular experiencean intellectual shock
like a flash of fire in the brain Sitting in darkness a great light
flooded him with wild brilliance He gasped

What you doin repeated Mr Levy

Penrod sprang to his feet seized the licorice bottle shook it with
stoppering thumb and took a long drink with histrionic unction

What you doin asked Maurice for the third time Sam Williams not
having decided upon a reply

It was Penrod who answered

Drinkin lickrish water he said simply and wiped his mouth with such
delicious enjoyment that Sams jaded thirst was instantly stimulated He
took the bottle eagerly from Penrod

Aah exclaimed Penrod smacking his lips That was a good un

The eyes above the fence glistened

Ask him if he dont want some Penrod whispered urgently Quit
drinkin it Its no good any more Ask him

What for demanded the practical Sam

Go on and ask him whispered Penrod fiercely

Say Mrice Sam called waving the bottle Want some

Bring it here Mr Levy requested

Come on over and get some returned Sam being prompted

I cant Penrod Schofields after me

No Im not said Penrod reassuringly I wont touch you Mrice
I made up with you yesterday afternoondont you remember Youre all
right with me Mrice

Maurice looked undecided But Penrod had the delectable bottle again
and tilting it above his lips affected to let the cool liquid purl
enrichingly into him while with his right hand he stroked his middle
facade ineffably Maurices mouth watered

Here cried Sam stirred again by the superb manifestations of his
friend Gimme that

Penrod brought the bottle down surprisingly full after so much gusto
but withheld it from Sam and the two scuffled for its possession
Nothing in the world could have so worked upon the desire of the
yearning observer beyond the fence

Honest Penrodyou aint goin to touch me if I come in your yard he
called Honest

Cross my heart answered Penrod holding the bottle away from Sam
And well let you drink all you want

Maurice hastily climbed the fence and while he was thus occupied Mr
Samuel Williams received a great enlightenment With startling rapidity
Penrod standing just outside the storeroom door extended his arm
within the room deposited the licorice water upon the counter of the
drug store seized in its stead the bottle of smallpox medicine and
extended it cordially toward the advancing Maurice

Genius is like thatgreat simple broad strokes

Dazzled Mr Samuel Williams leaned against the wall He had
the sensations of one who comes suddenly into the presence of a
chefdoeuvre Perhaps his first coherent thought was that almost
universal one on such huge occasions Why couldnt _I_ have done that

Sam might have been even more dazzled had he guessed that he figured not
altogether as a spectator in the sweeping and magnificent conception of
the new Talleyrand Sam had no partner for the cotillon If Maurice
was to be absent from that festivityas it began to seem he might
bePenrod needed a male friend to take care of Miss Rennsdale and he
believed he saw his way to compel Mr Williams to be that male friend
For this he relied largely upon the prospective conduct of Miss
Rennsdale when he should get the matter before herhe was inclined to
believe she would favour the exchange As for Talleyrand Penrod himself
he was going to dance that cotillon with Marjorie Jones

You can have all you can drink at one pull Mrice said Penrod
kindly

You said I could have all I want protested Maurice reaching for the
bottle

No I didnt returned Penrod quickly holding it away from the eager
hand

He did too Didnt he Sam

Sam could not reply his eyes fixed upon the bottle protruded
strangely

You heard himdidnt you Sam

Well if I did say it I didnt mean it said Penrod hastily quoting
from one of the authorities Looky here Mrice he continued
assuming a more placative and reasoning tone that wouldnt be fair to
us I guess we want some of our own lickrish water dont we The bottle
aint much over twothirds full anyway What I meant was you can have
all you can drink at one pull

How do you mean

Why this way you can gulp all you want so long as you keep
swallering but you cant take the bottle out of your mouth and commence
again Soons you quit swallering its Sams turn

No you can have next Penrod said Sam

Well anyway I mean Mrice has to give the bottle up the minute he
stops swallering

Craft appeared upon the face of Maurice like a poster pasted on a wall

I can drink so long I dont stop swallering

Yes thats it

All right he cried Gimme the bottle

And Penrod placed it in his hand

You promise to let me drink until I quit swallering Maurice insisted

Yes said both boys together

With that Maurice placed the bottle to his lips and began to drink
Penrod and Sam leaned forward in breathless excitement They had feared
Maurice might smell the contents of the bottle but that danger was
pastthis was the crucial moment Their fondest hope was that he would
make his first swallow a voracious oneit was impossible to imagine a
second They expected one big gulping swallow and then an explosion
with fountain effects

Little they knew the mettle of their man Maurice swallowed once he
swallowed twiceand thriceand he continued to swallow No Adams
apple was sculptured on that juvenile throat but the internal progress
of the liquid was not a whit the less visible His eyes gleamed with
cunning and malicious triumph sidewise at the stunned conspirators
he was fulfilling the conditions of the draught not once breaking the
thread of that marvelous swallering

His audience stood petrified Already Maurice had swallowed more than
they had given Duke and still the liquor receded in the uplifted bottle
And now the clear glass gleamed above the dark contents full half the
vessels lengthand Maurice went on drinking Slowly the clear glass
increased in its dimensionsslowly the dark diminished

Sam Williams made a horrified movement to check himbut Maurice
protested passionately with his disengaged arm and made vehement vocal
noises remindful of the contract whereupon Sam desisted and watched the
continuing performance in a state of grisly fascination

Maurice drank it all He drained the last drop and threw the bottle in
the air uttering loud ejaculations of triumph and satisfaction

Hah he cried blowing out his cheeks inflating his chest squaring
his shoulders patting his stomach and wiping his mouth contentedly
Hah Aha Waha Wafwah But that was good

The two boys stood looking at him in stupor

Well I gotta say this said Maurice graciously You stuck to your
bargain all right and treated me fair

Stricken with a sudden horrible suspicion Penrod entered the storeroom
in one stride and lifted the bottle of licorice water to his nosethen
to his lips It was weak but good he had made no mistake And Maurice
had really drainedto the dregsthe bottle of old hair tonics dead
catsups syrups of undesirable preserves condemned extracts of
vanilla and lemon decayed chocolate exessence of beef mixed dental
preparations aromatic spirits of ammonia spirits of nitre alcohol
arnica quinine ipecac sal volatile nux vomica and licorice water
with traces of arsenic belladonna and strychnine

Penrod put the licorice water out of sight and turned to face the
others Maurice was seating himself on a box just outside the door and
had taken a package of cigarettes from his pocket

Nobody can see me from here can they he said striking a match You
fellers smoke

No said Sam staring at him haggardly

No said Penrod in a whisper

Maurice lit his cigarette and puffed showily

Well sir he remarked you fellers are certainly squareI gotta
say that much Honest Penrod I thought you was after me I did
think so he added sunnily but now I guess you like me or else
you wouldnt of stuck to it about lettin me drink it all if I kept on
swallering

He chatted on with complete geniality smoking his cigarette in content
And as he ran from one topic to another his hearers stared at him in a
kind of torpor Never once did they exchange a glance with each other
their eyes were frozen to Maurice The cheerful conversationalist made
it evident that he was not without gratitude

Well he said as he finished his cigarette and rose to go you
fellers have treated me nice and some day you come over to my yard Id
like to run with you fellers Youre the kind of fellers I like

Penrods jaw fell Sams mouth had been open all the time Neither
spoke

I gotta go observed Maurice consulting a handsome watch Gotta get
dressed for the cotillon right after lunch Come on Sam Dont you have
to go too

Sam nodded dazedly

Well goodbye Penrod said Maurice cordially Im glad you like me
all right Come on Sam

Penrod leaned against the doorpost and with fixed and glazing eyes
watched the departure of his two visitors Maurice was talking volubly
with much gesticulation as they went but Sam walked mechanically
and in silence staring at his brisk companion and keeping at a little
distance from him

They passed from sight Maurice still conversing gaylyand Penrod
slowly betook himself into the house his head bowed upon his chest


Some three hours later Mr Samuel Williams waxen clean and in sweet
raiment made his reappearance in Penrods yard yodelling a codesignal
to summon forth his friend He yodelled loud long and frequently
finally securing a faint response from the upper air

Where are you shouted Mr Williams his roving glance searching
ambient heights Another lowspirited yodel reaching his ear he
perceived the head and shoulders of his friend projecting above the
roofridge of the stable The rest of Penrods body was concealed from
view reposing upon the opposite slant of the gable and precariously
secured by the crooking of his elbows over the ridge

Yay What you doin up there

Nothin

You better be careful Sam called Youll slide off and fall down in
the alley if you dont look out I come pert near it last time we was
up there Come on down Aint you goin to the cotillon

Penrod made no reply Sam came nearer

Say he called up in a guarded voice I went to our telephone a while
ago and ast him how he was feelin and he said he felt fine

So did I said Penrod He told me he felt bully

Sam thrust his hands in his pockets and brooded The opening of the
kitchen door caused a diversion It was Della

Mister Penrod she bellowed forthwith come ahn down frm up there
Yr mammas at the dancin class waitin fer ye an shes telephoned
me theyre goin to beginan whats the matter with ye Come ahn down
frm up there

Come on urged Sam Well be late There go Maurice and Marjorie
now

A glittering car spun by disclosing briefly a genre picture of Marjorie
Jones in pink supporting a monstrous sheaf of American Beauty roses
Maurice sitting shining and joyous beside her saw both boys and waved
them a hearty greeting as the car turned the corner

Penrod uttered some muffled words and then waved both armseither in
response or as an expression of his condition of mind it may have
been a gesture of despair How much intention there was in this
actobviously so rash considering the position he occupiedit
is impossible to say Undeniably there must remain a suspicion of
deliberate purpose

Della screamed and Sam shouted Penrod had disappeared from view

The delayed dance was about to begin a most uneven cotillon when Samuel
Williams arrived

Mrs Schofield hurriedly left the ballroom while Miss Rennsdale
flushing with sudden happiness curtsied profoundly to Professor Bartet
and obtained his attention

I have telled you fifty times he informed her passionately ere she
spoke I cannot make no such changes If your partner comes you have to
dance with him You are going to drive me crazy sure What is it What
now What you want

The damsel curtsied again and handed him the following communication
addressed to herself


Dear madam Please excuse me from dancing the cotilon with you
this afternoon as I have fell off the barn

Sincerly yours

PENROD SCHOFIELD



CHAPTER XV THE TWO FAMILIES

Penrod entered the schoolroom Monday picturesquely leaning upon a mans
cane shortened to support a cripple approaching the age of twelve He
arrived about twenty minutes late limping deeply his brave young mouth
drawn with pain and the sensation he created must have been a solace to
him the only possible criticism of this entrance being that it was just
a shade too heroic Perhaps for that reason it failed to stagger Miss
Spence a woman so saturated with suspicion that she penalized Penrod
for tardiness as promptly and as coldly as if he had been a mere
ordinary unmutilated boy Nor would she entertain any discussion of the
justice of her ruling It seemed almost that she feared to argue with
him

However the distinction of cane and limp remained to him consolations
which he protracted far into the weekuntil Thursday evening in fact
when Mr Schofield observing from a window his sons pursuit of Duke
round and round the backyard confiscated the cane with the promise
that it should not remain idle if he saw Penrod limping again Thus
succeeding a depressing Friday another Saturday brought the necessity
for new inventions

It was a scented morning in appleblossom time At about ten of the
clock Penrod emerged hastily from the kitchen door His pockets bulged
abnormally so did his checks and he swallowed with difficulty A
threatening mop wielded by a cooklike arm in a checkered sleeve
followed him through the doorway and he was preceded by a small
hurried wistful dog with a warm doughnut in his mouth The kitchen door
slammed petulantly enclosing the sore voice of Della whereupon Penrod
and Duke seated themselves upon the pleasant sward and immediately
consumed the spoils of their raid

From the crossstreet which formed the side boundary of the Schofields
ample yard came a jingle of harness and the cadenced clatter of a pair
of trotting horses and Penrod looking up beheld the passing of a
fat acquaintance torpid amid the conservative splendours of a rather
oldfashioned victoria This was Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior a
fellow sufferer at the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class but otherwise not
often a companion a homesheltered lad tutored privately and preserved
against the coarsening influences of rude comradeship and miscellaneous
information Heavily overgrown in all physical dimensions virtuous
and placid this cloistered mutton was wholly uninteresting to Penrod
Schofield Nevertheless Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior was a
personage on account of the importance of the Magsworth Bitts family
and it was Penrods destiny to increase Rodericks celebrity far far
beyond its present aristocratic limitations

The Magsworth Bittses were important because they were impressive there
was no other reason And they were impressive because they believed
themselves important The adults of the family were impregnably formal
they dressed with reticent elegance and wore the same nose and the
same expressionan expression which indicated that they knew something
exquisite and sacred which other people could never know Other people
in their presence were apt to feel mysteriously ignoble and to
become secretly uneasy about ancestors gloves and pronunciation The
Magsworth Bitts manner was withholding and reserved though sometimes
gracious granting small smiles as great favours and giving off a
chilling kind of preciousness Naturally when any citizen of the
community did anything unconventional or improper or made a mistake or
had a relative who went wrong that citizens first and worst fear
was that the Magsworth Bittses would hear of it In fact this painful
family had for years terrorized the community though the community
had never realized that it was terrorized and invariably spoke of the
family as the most charming circle in town By common consent Mrs
Roderick Magsworth Bitts officiated as the supreme model as well as
criticinchief of morals and deportment for all the unlucky people
prosperous enough to be elevated to her acquaintance

Magsworth was the important part of the name Mrs Roderick Magsworth
Bitts was a Magsworth born herself and the Magsworth crest decorated
not only Mrs Magsworth Bitts notepaper but was on the china on the
table linen on the chimneypieces on the opaque glass of the front
door on the victoria and on the harness though omitted from the
gardenhose and the lawnmower

Naturally no sensible person dreamed of connecting that illustrious
crest with the unfortunate and notorious Rena Magsworth whose name had
grown week by week into larger and larger type upon the front pages of
newspapers owing to the gradually increasing public and official belief
that she had poisoned a family of eight However the statement that no
sensible person could have connected the Magsworth Bitts family with the
arsenical Rena takes no account of Penrod Schofield

Penrod never missed a murder a hanging or an electrocution in the
newspapers he knew almost as much about Rena Magsworth as her jurymen
did though they sat in a courtroom two hundred miles away and he had
it in mindso frank he wasto ask Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior if
the murderess happened to be a relative

The present encounter being merely one of apathetic greeting did not
afford the opportunity Penrod took off his cap and Roderick seated
between his mother and one of his grownup sisters nodded sluggishly
but neither Mrs Magsworth Bitts nor her daughter acknowledged the
salutation of the boy in the yard They disapproved of him as a
person of little consequence and that little bad Snubbed Penrod
thoughtfully restored his cap to his head A boy can be cut as
effectually as a man and this one was chilled to a low temperature He
wondered if they despised him because they had seen a last fragment of
doughnut in his hand then he thought that perhaps it was Duke who had
disgraced him Duke was certainly no fashionable looking dog

The resilient spirits of youth however presently revived and
discovering a spider upon one knee and a beetle simultaneously upon the
other Penrod forgot Mrs Roderick Magsworth Bitts in the course of
some experiments infringing upon the domain of Doctor Carrel Penrods
effortswith the aid of a pinto effect a transference of living
organism were unsuccessful but he convinced himself forever that a
spider cannot walk with a beetles legs Della then enhanced zoological
interest by depositing upon the back porch a large rattrap from the
cellar the prison of four live rats awaiting execution

Penrod at once took possession retiring to the empty stable where
he installed the rats in a small wooden box with a sheet of broken
windowglassheld down by a brickbatover the top Thus the symptoms
of their agitation when the box was shaken or hammered upon could be
studied at leisure Altogether this Saturday was starting splendidly

After a time the students attention was withdrawn from his specimens
by a peculiar smell which being followed up by a system of selective
sniffing proved to be an emanation leaking into the stable from the
alley He opened the back door

Across the alley was a cottage which a thrifty neighbour had built on
the rear line of his lot and rented to negroes and the fact that a
negro family was now in process of moving in was manifested by the
presence of a thin mule and a ramshackle wagon the latter laden
with the semblance of a stove and a few other unpretentious household
articles

A very small darky boy stood near the mule In his hand was a rusty
chain and at the end of the chain the delighted Penrod perceived the
source of the special smell he was tracinga large raccoon Duke
who had shown not the slightest interest in the rats set up a frantic
barking and simulated a ravening assault upon the strange animal It
was only a bit of acting however for Duke was an old dog had suffered
much and desired no unnecessary sorrow wherefore he confined his
demonstrations to alarums and excursions and presently sat down at
a distance and expressed himself by intermittent threatenings in a
quavering falsetto

Whats that coons name asked Penrod intending no discourtesy

Aim gommo mame said the small darky

What

Aim gommo mame

WHAT

The small darky looked annoyed

Aim GOMMO mame I hell you he said impatiently

Penrod conceived that insult was intended

Whats the matter of you he demanded advancing You get fresh with
ME and Ill

Hyuh white boy A coloured youth of Penrods own age appeared in
the doorway of the cottage You let at brothuh mine alone He ain do
nothin to you

Well why cant he answer

He cant He cant talk no bettern what he WAS talkin He
tonguetie

Oh said Penrod mollified Then obeying an impulse so universally
aroused in the human breast under like circumstances that it has become
a quip he turned to the afflicted one

Talk some more he begged eagerly

I hoe you ackoom aim gommo mame was the prompt response in which
a slight ostentation was manifest Unmistakable tokens of vanity had
appeared upon the small swart countenance

Whats he mean asked Penrod enchanted

He say he tole you at coon ain got no name

Whats YOUR name

Im name Herman

Whats his name Penrod pointed to the tonguetied boy

Verman

What

Verman Was three us boys in ow famly Olest one name Sherman Nen
come me Im Herman Nen come him he Verman Sherman dead Verman he
de littles one

You goin to live here

Umhuh Done move in fm way outen on a fahm

He pointed to the north with his right hand and Penrods eyes opened
wide as they followed the gesture Herman had no forefinger on that
hand

Look there exclaimed Penrod You havent got any finger

_I_ mum map said Verman with egregious pride

HE done at interpreted Herman chuckling Yessuh done chop er
spang off long go Hes a playin wif a ax an I lay my finguh on de
dosill an I say Verman chop er off So Verman he chop er right
spang off up to de roots Yessuh

What FOR

Jes fo nothin

He hoe me hoo remarked Verman

Yessuh I tole him to said Herman an he chop er off an ey aint
airy oth one evuh grown on wheres de ole one use to grow Nosuh

But whatd you tell him to do it for

Nothin I es said it at wayan he jes chop er off

Both brothers looked pleased and proud Penrods profound interest was
flatteringly visible a tribute to their unusualness

Hem bow goy suggested Verman eagerly

Aw ri said Herman Ow sistuh Queenie she a growedup woman she
got a goituh

Got a what

Goituh Swellin on her neckgrea big swellin She heppin mammy
move in now You look in de frontroom winduh wheres she sweepin you
kin see it on her

Penrod looked in the window and was rewarded by a fine view of Queenies
goitre He had never before seen one and only the lure of further
conversation on the part of Verman brought him from the window

Verman say tell you bout pappy explained Herman Mammy an Queenie
move in town an go git de house all fix up befo pappy git out

Out of where

Jail Pappy cut a man an de police done kep him in jail evuh sense
Chrismustime but dey goin tuhn him loose agin nex week

Whatd he cut the other man with

Wif a pitchfawk

Penrod began to feel that a lifetime spent with this fascinating family
were all too short The brothers glowing with amiability were as
enraptured as he For the first time in their lives they moved in the
rich glamour of sensationalism Herman was prodigal of gesture with his
right hand and Verman chuckling with delight talked fluently
though somewhat consciously They cheerfully agreed to keep the
raccoonalready beginning to be mentioned as our coon by Penrodin
Mr Schofields empty stable and when the animal had been chained to
the wall near the box of rats and supplied with a pan of fair water
they assented to their new friends suggestion inspired by a fine
sense of the artistic harmonies that the heretofore nameless pet be
christened Sherman in honour of their deceased relative

At this juncture was heard from the front yard the sound of that
yodelling which is the peculiar accomplishment of those whose voices
have not changed Penrod yodelled a response and Mr Samuel Williams
appeared a large bundle under his arm

Yay Penrod was his greeting casual enough from without but having
entered he stopped short and emitted a prodigious whistle YAAAY
he then shouted Look at the coon

I guess you better say Look at the coon Penrod returned proudly
Theys a good deal moren him to look at too Talk some Verman
Verman complied

Sam was warmly interested Whatd you say his name was he asked

Verman

How dyou spell it

Verman replied Penrod having previously received this
information from Herman

Oh said Sam

Point to sumpthing Herman Penrod commanded and Sams excitement
when Herman pointed was sufficient to the occasion

Penrod the discoverer continued his exploitation of the manifold
wonders of the Sherman Herman and Verman collection With the air of
a proprietor he escorted Sam into the alley for a good look at Queenie
who seemed not to care for her increasing celebrity and proceeded to
a dramatic climaxthe recital of the episode of the pitchfork and its
consequences

The cumulative effect was enormous and could have but one possible
result The normal boy is always at least one half Barnum

Lets get up a SHOW

Penrod and Sam both claimed to have said it first a question left
unsettled in the ecstasies of hurried preparation The bundle under
Sams arm brought with no definite purpose proved to have been
an inspiration It consisted of broad sheets of light yellow
wrappingpaper discarded by Sams mother in her spring housecleaning
There were halffilled cans and buckets of paint in the storeroom
adjoining the carriagehouse and presently the side wall of the stable
flamed information upon the passerby from a great and spreading poster

Publicity primal requisite of all theatrical and amphitheatrical
enterprise thus provided subsequent arrangements proceeded with a fury
of energy which transformed the empty hayloft True it is impossible to
say just what the hayloft was transformed into but history warrantably
clings to the statement that it was transformed Duke and Sherman were
secured to the rear wall at a considerable distance from each other
after an exhibition of reluctance on the part of Duke during which he
displayed a nervous energy and agility almost miraculous in so small and
middleaged a dog Benches were improvised for spectators the rats
were brought up finally the rafters corncrib and haychute were
ornamented with flags and strips of bunting from Sam Williams
attic Sam returning from the excursion wearing an old silk hat and
accompanied on account of a rope by a fine dachshund encountered on
the highway In the matter of personal decoration paint was generously
used an interpretation of the spiral inclining to whites and greens
becoming brilliantly effective upon the dark facial backgrounds of
Herman and Verman while the countenances of Sam and Penrod were each
supplied with the black moustache and imperial lacking which no
professional showman can be esteemed conscientious

It was regretfully decided in council that no attempt be made to add
Queenie to the list of exhibits her brothers warmly declining to act as
ambassadors in that cause They were certain Queenie would not like
the idea they said and Herman picturesquely described her activity
on occasions when she had been annoyed by too much attention to her
appearance However Penrods disappointment was alleviated by an
inspiration which came to him in a moment of pondering upon the
dachshund and the entire party went forth to add an enriching line to
the poster

They found a group of seven including two adults already gathered in
the street to read and admire this work

A heated argument took place between Sam and Penrod the point at issue
being settled finally by the drawing of straws whereupon Penrod with
pardonable selfimportancein the presence of an audience now increased
to nineslowly painted the words inspired by the dachshund

CHAPTER XVI THE NEW STAR

Sam Penrod Herman and Verman withdrew in considerable state from
nonpaying view and repairing to the hayloft declared the exhibition
open to the public Oral proclamation was made by Sam and then the
loitering multitude was enticed by the seductive strains of a band the
two partners performing upon combs and paper Herman and Verman upon tin
pans with sticks

The effect was immediate Visitors appeared upon the stairway and sought
admission Herman and Verman took position among the exhibits near
the wall Sam stood at the entrance officiating as barker and
ticketseller while Penrod with debonair suavity acted as curator
master of ceremonies and lecturer He greeted the first to enter with a
courtly bow They consisted of Miss Rennsdale and her nursery governess
and they paid spot cash for their admission

Walk in laydeeze walk right inpray do not obstruck the
passageway said Penrod in a remarkable voice Pray be seated there
is room for each and all

Miss Rennsdale and governess were followed by Mr Georgie Bassett and
baby sister which proves the perfection of Georgies character and
six or seven other neighbourhood childrena most satisfactory audience
although subsequent to Miss Rennsdale and governess admission was
wholly by pin

GENtilmun and LAYdeeze shouted Penrod I will first call your
attainshon to our genuine South American dog part alligator He
pointed to the dachshund and added in his ordinary tone Thats him
Straightway reassuming the character of showman he bellowed NEXT
you see Duke the genuine fullblooded Indian dog from the far Western
Plains and Rocky Mountains NEXT the trained Michigan rats captured
way up there and trained to jump and run all around the box at theat
theat the slightest PREtext He paused partly to take breath and
partly to enjoy his own surprised discovery that this phrase was in his
vocabulary

At the slightest PREtext he repeated and continued suiting the
action to the word I will now hammer upon the box and each and all may
see these genuine fullblooded Michigan rats perform at the slightest
PREtext There Thats all they do now but I and Sam are goin to
train em lots more before this afternoon GENtilmun and LAYdeeze I
will kindly now call your attainshon to Sherman the wild animal
from Africa costing the lives of the wild trapper and many of his

wild tattooed men which the father of is in jail Point Herman Each

This is the only genuine onefingered tattooed wild man Last on
the programme gentilmun and laydeeze we have Verman the savage
tattooed wild boy that cant speak only his native foreign languages
Talk some Verman

Verman obliged and made an instantaneous hit He was encored
rapturously again and again and thrilling with the unique pleasure of
being appreciated and misunderstood at the same time would have talked
all day but too gladly Sam Williams however with a true showmans
foresight whispered to Penrod who rang down on the monologue

GENtilmun and LAYdeeze this closes our pufformance Pray pass out
quietly and with as little jostling as possible As soon as you are all
out theres goin to be a new pufformance and each and all are welcome
at the same and simple price of admission Pray pass out quietly and
with as little jostling as possible REMEMBUR the price is only one
cent the tenth part of a dime or twenty pins no bent ones taken Pray
pass out quietly and with as little jostling as possible The Schofield
and Williams Military Band will play before each pufformance and each
and all are welcome for the same and simple price of admission Pray
pass out quietly and with as little jostling as possible

Forthwith the Schofield and Williams Military Band began a second
overture in which something vaguely like a tune was at times
distinguishable and all of the first audience returned most of them
having occupied the interval in hasty excursions for more pins Miss
Rennsdale and governess however again paying coin of the Republic and
receiving deference and the best seats accordingly And when a third
performance found all of the same inveterate patrons once more crowding
the auditorium and seven recruits added the pleasurable excitement of
the partners in their venture will be understood by any one who has seen
a metropolitan manager strolling about the foyer of his theatre some
evening during the earlier stages of an assured phenomenal run

From the first there was no question which feature of the entertainment
was the attraction extraordinary VermanVerman the savage tattooed
wild boy speaking only his native foreign languagesVerman was a
triumph Beaming wreathed in smiles melodious incredibly fluent
he had but to open his lips and a dead hush fell upon the audience
Breathless they leaned forward hanging upon his every semisyllable
and when Penrod checked the flow burst into thunders of applause
which Verman received with happy laughter

Alas he delayed not oer long to display all the egregiousness of a
new star but for a time there was no caprice of his too eccentric to
be forgiven During Penrods lecture upon the other curios the tattooed
wild boy continually stamped his foot grinned and gesticulated
tapping his tiny chest and pointing to himself as it were to say Wait
for Me I am the Big Show So soon they learn so soon they learn And
again alas this spoiled darling of public favour like many another
was fated to know in good time the fickleness of that favour

But during all the morning performances he was the idol of his audience
and looked it The climax of his popularity came during the fifth
overture of the Schofield and Williams Military Band when the music
was quite drowned in the agitated clamours of Miss Rennsdale who was
endeavouring to ascend the stairs in spite of the physical dissuasion of
her governess

I WONT go home to lunch screamed Miss Rennsdale her voice
accompanied by a sound of ripping I WILL hear the tattooed wild boy
talk some more Its lovelyI WILL hear him talk I WILL I WILL I
want to listen to VermanI WANT toI WANT to

Wailing she was borne awayof her sex not the first to be fascinated
by obscurity nor the last to champion its eloquence

Verman was almost unendurable after this but like many many other
managers Schofield and Williams restrained their choler and even
laughed fulsomely when their principal attraction essayed the role of a
comedian in private and capered and squawked in sheer fatuous vanity

The first performance of the afternoon rivalled the successes of the
morning and although Miss Rennsdale was detained at home thus drying
up the single source of cash income developed before lunch Maurice Levy
appeared escorting Marjorie Jones and paid coin for two admissions
dropping the money into Sams hand with a carelessnay a
contemptuousgesture At sight of Marjorie Penrod Schofield flushed
under his new moustache repainted since noon and lectured as he had
never lectured before A new grace invested his every gesture a new
sonorousness rang in his voice a simple and manly pomposity marked
his very walk as he passed from curio to curio And when he fearlessly
handled the box of rats and hammered upon it with cool insouciance he
beheldfor the first time in his lifea purl of admiration eddying in
Marjories lovely eye a certain softening of that eye And then Verman
spake and Penrod was forgotten Marjories eye rested upon him no more

A heavily equipped chauffeur ascended the stairway bearing the message
that Mrs Levy awaited her son and his lady Thereupon having devoured
the last sound permitted by the managers to issue from Verman Mr
Levy and Miss Jones departed to a real matinee at a real theatre the
limpid eyes of Marjorie looking back softly over her shoulderbut only
at the tattooed wild boy Nearly always it is woman who puts the irony
into life

After this perhaps because of sated curiosity perhaps on account of a
pin famine the attendance began to languish Only four responded to
the next call of the band the four dwindled to three finally the
entertainment was given for one blase auditor and Schofield and
Williams looked depressed Then followed an interval when the band
played in vain

About three oclock Schofield and Williams were gloomily discussing
various unpromising devices for startling the public into a renewal of
interest when another patron unexpectedly appeared and paid a cent for
his admission News of the Big Show and Museum of Curiosities had at
last penetrated the far cold spaces of interstellar niceness for this
new patron consisted of no less than Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior
escaped in a white sailor suit from the Manor during a period of
severe maternal and tutorial preoccupation

He seated himself without parley and the pufformance was offered for
his entertainment with admirable conscientiousness True to the Lady
Clara caste and training Rodericks pale fat face expressed nothing
except an impervious superiority and as he sat cold and unimpressed
upon the front bench like a large white lump it must be said that
he made a discouraging audience to play to He was not however
unresponsivefar from it He offered comment very chilling to the warm
grandiloquence of the orator

Thats my uncle Ethelberts dachshund he remarked at the beginning
of the lecture You better take him back if you dont want to get
arrested And when Penrod rather uneasily ignoring the interruption
proceeded to the exploitation of the genuine fullblooded Indian dog
Duke Why dont you try to give that old dog away asked Roderick
You couldnt sell him

My papa would buy me a lots better coon than that was the
information volunteered a little later only I wouldnt want the nasty
old thing

Herman of the missing finger obtained no greater indulgence Pooh
said Roderick We have two foxterriers in our stables that took prizes
at the kennel show and their tails were BIT off Theres a man that
always bites foxterriers tails off

Oh my gosh what a lie exclaimed Sam Williams ignorantly

Go on with the show whether he likes it or not Penrod Hes paid his
money

Verman confident in his own singular powers chuckled openly at the
failure of the other attractions to charm the frosty visitor and
when his turn came poured forth a torrent of conversation which was
straightway damned

Rotten said Mr Bitts languidly Anybody could talk like that _I_
could do it if I wanted to

Verman paused suddenly

YES you could exclaimed Penrod stung Lets hear you do it then

Yessir the other partner shouted Lets just hear you DO it

I said I could if I wanted to responded Roderick I didnt say I
WOULD

Yay Knows he cant sneered Sam

I can too if I try

Well lets hear you try

So challenged the visitor did try but in the absence of an impartial
jury his effort was considered so pronounced a failure that he was
howled down derided and mocked with great clamours

Anyway said Roderick when things had quieted down if I couldnt
get up a better show than this Id sell out and leave town

Not having enough presence of mind to inquire what he would sell out
his adversaries replied with mere formless yells of scorn

I could get up a better show than this with my left hand Roderick
asserted

Well what would you have in your ole show asked Penrod
condescending to language

Thats all right what Id HAVE Id have enough

You couldnt get Herman and Verman in your ole show

No and I wouldnt want em either

Well what WOULD you have insisted Penrod derisively Youd have to
have SUMPTHINGyou couldnt be a show yourself

How do YOU know This was but meandering while waiting for ideas and
evoked another yell

You think you could be a show all by yourself demanded Penrod

How do YOU know I couldnt

Two white boys and two black boys shrieked their scorn of the boaster

I could too Roderick raised his voice to a sudden howl obtaining a
hearing

Well why dont you tell us how

Well _I_ know HOW all right said Roderick If anybody asks you
you can just tell him I know HOW all right

Why you cant DO anything Sam began argumentatively You talk
about being a show all by yourself what could you try to do Show us
sumpthing you can do

I didnt say I was going to DO anything returned the badgered one
still evading

Well then howd you BE a show Penrod demanded WE got a show here
even if Herman didnt point or Verman didnt talk Their father stabbed
a man with a pitchfork I guess didnt he

How do _I_ know

Well I guess hes in jail aint he

Well what if their father is in jail I didnt say he wasnt did I

Well YOUR father aint in jail is he

Well I never said he was did I

Well then continued Penrod how could you be a He stopped
abruptly staring at Roderick the birth of an idea plainly visible in
his altered expression He had suddenly remembered his intention to
ask Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior about Rena Magsworth and this
recollection collided in his mind with the irritation produced by
Rodericks claiming some mysterious attainment which would warrant his
setting up as a show in his single person Penrods whole manner changed
instantly

Roddy he asked almost overwhelmed by a prescience of something vast
and magnificent Roddy are you any relation of Rena Magsworth

Roderick had never heard of Rena Magsworth although a concentration
of the sentence yesterday pronounced upon her had burned black and
horrific upon the face of every newspaper in the country He was not
allowed to read the journals of the day and his familys indignation
over the sacrilegious coincidence of the name had not been expressed in
his presence But he saw that it was an awesome name to Penrod Schofield
and Samuel Williams Even Herman and Verman though lacking many
educational advantages on account of a long residence in the country
were informed on the subject of Rena Magsworth through hearsay and they
joined in the portentous silence

Roddy repeated Penrod honest is Rena Magsworth some relation of
yours

There is no obsession more dangerous to its victims than a conviction
especially an inherited oneof superiority this world is so full
of Missourians And from his earliest years Roderick Magsworth Bitts
Junior had been trained to believe in the importance of the Magsworth
family At every meal he absorbed a sense of Magsworth greatness and
yet in his infrequent meetings with persons of his own age and sex
he was treated as negligible Now dimly he perceived that there was
a Magsworth claim of some sort which was impressive even to boys
Magsworth blood was the essential of all true distinction in the world
he knew Consequently having been driven into a culdesac as a result
of flagrant and unfounded boasting he was ready to take advantage of
what appeared to be a triumphal way out

Roddy said Penrod again with solemnity is Rena Magsworth some
relation of yours

IS she Roddy asked Sam almost hoarsely

Shes my aunt shouted Roddy

Silence followed Sam and Penrod spellbound gazed upon Roderick
Magsworth Bitts Junior So did Herman and Verman Roddys staggering
lie had changed the face of things utterly No one questioned it no one
realized that it was much too good to be true

Roddy said Penrod in a voice tremulous with hope Roddy will you
join our show

Roddy joined

Even he could see that the offer implied his being starred as the
paramount attraction of a new order of things It was obvious that he
had swelled out suddenly in the estimation of the other boys to that
importance which he had been taught to believe his native gift and
natural right The sensation was pleasant He had often been treated
with effusion by grownup callers and by acquaintances of his mothers
and sisters he had heard ladies speak of him as charming and that
delightful child and little girls had sometimes shown him deference
but until this moment no boy had ever allowed him for one moment to
presume even to equality Now in a trice he was not only admitted
to comradeship but patently valued as something rare and sacred to be
acclaimed and pedestalled In fact the very first thing that Schofield
and Williams did was to find a box for him to stand upon

The misgivings roused in Rodericks bosom by the subsequent activities
of the firm were not bothersome enough to make him forego his prominence
as Exhibit A He was not a quickminded boy and it was long and
much happened before he thoroughly comprehended the causes of his new
celebrity He had a shadowy feeling that if the affair came to be heard
of at home it might not be liked but intoxicated by the glamour and
bustle which surround a public character he made no protest On the
contrary he entered wholeheartedly into the preparations for the
new show Assuming with Sams assistance a blue moustache and
sideburns he helped in the painting of a new poster which
supplanting the old one on the wall of the stable facing the
crossstreet screamed bloody murder at the passers in that rather
populous thoroughfare

CHAPTER XVII RETIRING FROM THE SHOWBUSINESS

Megaphones were constructed out of heavy wrappingpaper and Penrod
Sam and Herman set out in different directions delivering vocally
the inflammatory proclamation of the poster to a large section of the
residential quarter and leaving Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior with
Verman in the loft shielded from all deadhead eyes Upon the return
of the heralds the Schofield and Williams Military Band played
deafeningly and an awakened public once more thronged to fill the
coffers of the firm

Prosperity smiled again The very first audience after the acquisition
of Roderick was larger than the largest of the morning Master
Bittsthe only exhibit placed upon a boxwas a supercurio All eyes
fastened upon him and remained hungrily feasting throughout Penrods
luminous oration

But the glory of one light must ever be the dimming of another We dwell
in a vale of seesawsand cobwebs spin fastest upon laurel Verman the
tattooed wild boy speaking only in his native foreign languages Verman
the gay Verman the caperer capered no more he chuckled no more he
beckoned no more nor tapped his chest nor wreathed his idolatrous face
in smiles Gone all gone were his little artifices for attracting the
general attention to himself gone was every engaging mannerism which
had endeared him to the mercurial public He squatted against the wall
and glowered at the new sensation It was the old storythe old
old story of too much temperament Verman was suffering from artistic
jealousy

The second audience contained a cashpaying adult a spectacled young
man whose poignant attention was very flattering He remained after the
lecture and put a few questions to Roddy which were answered rather
confusedly upon promptings from Penrod The young man went away without
having stated the object of his interrogations but it became quite
plain later in the day This same object caused the spectacled young
man to make several brief but stimulating calls directly after leaving
the Schofield and Williams Big Show and the consequences thereof
loitered not by the wayside

The Big Show was at high tide Not only was the auditorium filled
and throbbing there was an indubitable lineby no means wholly
juvenilewaiting for admission to the next pufformance A group stood
in the street examining the poster earnestly as it glowed in the long
slanting rays of the westward sun and people in automobiles and other
vehicles had halted wheel in the street to read the message so piquantly
given to the world These were the conditions when a crested victoria
arrived at a gallop and a large chastely magnificent and highly
flushed woman descended and progressed across the yard with an air of
violence

At sight of her the adults of the waiting line hastily disappeared
and most of the pausing vehicles moved instantly on their way She was
followed by a stricken man in livery

The stairs to the auditorium were narrow and steep Mrs Roderick
Magsworth Bitts was of a stout favour and the voice of Penrod was
audible during the ascent

REMEMBUR gentilmun and laydeeze each and all are now gazing upon
Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior the only living nephew of the great
Rena Magsworth She stuck arsnic in the milk of eight separate and
distinck people to put in their coffee and each and all of em died The
great arsnic murderess Rena Magsworth gentilmun and laydeeze
and Roddys her only living nephew Shes a relation of all the Bitts
family but hes her one and only living nephew REMEMBUR Next July
shes goin to be hung and each and all you now see before you

Penrod paused abruptly seeing something before himselfthe august and
awful presence which filled the entryway And his words it should be
related froze upon his lips

Before HERSELF Mrs Roderick Magsworth Bitts saw her sonher
scionwearing a moustache and sideburns of blue and perched upon a box
flanked by Sherman and Verman the Michigan rats the Indian dog Duke
Herman and the dog part alligator

Roddy also saw something before himself It needed no prophet to
read the countenance of the dread apparition in the entryway His mouth
openedremained openthen filled to capacity with a calamitous sound
of grief not unmingled with apprehension

Penrods reason staggered under the crisis For a horrible moment he saw
Mrs Roderick Magsworth Bitts approaching like some fatal mountain in
avalanche She seemed to grow larger and redder lightnings played about
her head he had a vague consciousness of the audience spraying out
in flight of the squealings tramplings and dispersals of a stricken
field The mountain was close upon him

He stood by the open mouth of the haychute which went through the floor
to the manger below Penrod also went through the floor He propelled
himself into the chute and shot down but not quite to the manger for
Mr Samuel Williams had thoughtfully stepped into the chute a moment in
advance of his partner Penrod lit upon Sam

Catastrophic noises resounded in the loft volcanoes seemed to romp upon
the stairway

There ensued a period when only a shrill keening marked the passing of
Roderick as he was borne to the tumbril Then all was silence


   Sunset striking through a western window rouged the walls of
the Schofields library where gathered a joint family council and
court martial of fourMrs Schofield Mr Schofield and Mr and Mrs
Williams parents of Samuel of that ilk Mr Williams read aloud a
conspicuous passage from the last edition of the evening paper

Prominent people here believed close relations of woman sentenced to
hang Angry denial by Mrs R Magsworth Bitts Relationship admitted by
younger member of family His statement confirmed by boyfriends

Dont said Mrs Williams addressing her husband vehemently Weve
all read it a dozen times Weve got plenty of trouble on our hands
without hearing THAT again

Singularly enough Mrs Williams did not look troubled she looked as
if she were trying to look troubled Mrs Schofield wore a similar
expression So did Mr Schofield So did Mr Williams

What did she say when she called YOU up Mrs Schofield inquired
breathlessly of Mrs Williams

She could hardly speak at first and then when she did talk she talked
so fast I couldnt understand most of it and

It was just the same when she tried to talk to me said Mrs
Schofield nodding

I never did hear any one in such a state before continued Mrs
Williams So furious

Quite justly of course said Mrs Schofield

Of course And she said Penrod and Sam had enticed Roderick away from
homeusually hes not allowed to go outside the yard except with his
tutor or a servantand had told him to say that horrible creature was
his aunt

How in the world do you suppose Sam and Penrod ever thought of such
a thing as THAT exclaimed Mrs Schofield It must have been made up
just for their show Della says there were just STREAMS going in and
out all day Of course it wouldnt have happened but this was the day
Margaret and I spend every month in the country with Aunt Sarah and I
didnt DREAM

She said one thing I thought rather tactless interrupted Mrs
Williams Of course we must allow for her being dreadfully excited and
wrought up but I do think it wasnt quite delicate in her and shes
usually the very soul of delicacy She said that Roderick had NEVER been
allowed to associate withcommon boys

Meaning Sam and Penrod said Mrs Schofield Yes she said that to
me too

She said that the most awful thing about it Mrs Williams went on
was that though shes going to prosecute the newspapers many people
would always believe the story and

Yes I imagine they will said Mrs Schofield musingly Of course you
and I and everybody who really knows the Bitts and Magsworth families
understand the perfect absurdity of it but I suppose there are ever so
many wholl believe it no matter what the Bittses and Magsworths say

Hundreds and hundreds said Mrs Williams Im afraid it will be a
great comedown for them

Im afraid so said Mrs Schofield gently A very great oneyes a
very very great one

Well observed Mrs Williams after a thoughtful pause theres only
one thing to be done and I suppose it had better be done right away

She glanced toward the two gentlemen

Certainly Mr Schofield agreed But where ARE they

Have you looked in the stable asked his wife

I searched it Theyve probably started for the far West

Did you look in the sawdustbox

No I didnt

Then thats where they are

Thus in the early twilight the now historic stable was approached by
two fathers charged to do the only thing to be done They entered the
storeroom

Penrod said Mr Schofield

Sam said Mr Williams

Nothing disturbed the twilight hush

But by means of a ladder brought from the carriagehouse Mr Schofield
mounted to the top of the sawdustbox He looked within and discerned
the dim outlines of three quiet figures the third being that of a small
dog

The two boys rose upon command descended the ladder after Mr
Schofield bringing Duke with them and stood before the authors of
their being who bent upon them sinister and threatening brows With
hanging heads and despondent countenances each still ornamented with a
moustache and an imperial Penrod and Sam awaited sentence

This is a boys lot anything he does anything whatever may afterward
turn out to have been a crimehe never knows

And punishment and clemency are alike inexplicable

Mr Williams took his son by the ear

You march home he commanded

Sam marched not looking back and his father followed the small figure
implacably

You goin to whip me quavered Penrod alone with Justice

Wash your face at that hydrant said his father sternly

About fifteen minutes later Penrod hurriedly entering the corner drug
store two blocks distant was astonished to perceive a familiar form at
the soda counter

Yay Penrod said Sam Williams Want some sody Come on He didnt
lick me He didnt do anything to me at all He gave me a quarter

Sod mine said Penrod



CHAPTER XVIII MUSIC

Boyhood is the longest time in life for a boy The last term of the
schoolyear is made of decades not of weeks and living through them is
like waiting for the millennium But they do pass somehow and at last
there came a day when Penrod was one of a group that capered out
from the gravelled yard of Ward School Nomber Seventh carolling a
leavetaking of the institution of their instructress and not even
forgetting Mr Capps the janitor

Goodbye teacher Goodbye school Goodbye Cappsie dern ole fool

Penrod sang the loudest For every boy there is an age when he finds
his voice Penrods had not changed but he had found it Inevitably
that thing had come upon his family and the neighbours and his father
a somewhat dyspeptic man quoted frequently the expressive words of
the Lady of Shalott but there were others whose sufferings were as
poignant

Vacationtime warmed the young of the world to pleasant languor and
a morning came that was like a brightly coloured picture in a childs
fairy story Miss Margaret Schofield reclining in a hammock upon the
front porch was beautiful in the eyes of a newly made senior well
favoured and in fair raiment beside her A guitar rested lightly upon
his knee and he was trying to playa matter of some difficulty as
the floor of the porch also seemed inclined to be musical From directly
under his feet came a voice of song shrill loud incredibly piercing
and incredibly flat dwelling upon each syllable with incomprehensible
reluctance to leave it

 I have lands and earthly powwur
 Id give all for a nowwur
 Whiilst setting at MYYY dear old mothers kneeee
 Sooo remmembur whilst youre young

Miss Schofield stamped heartily upon the musical floor

Its Penrod she explained The lattice at the end of the porch is
loose and he crawls under and comes out all bugs Hes been having
a dreadful singing fit latelyrunning away to picture shows and
vaudeville I suppose

Mr Robert Williams looked upon her yearningly He touched a thrilling
chord on his guitar and leaned nearer But you said you have missed
me he began I

The voice of Penrod drowned all other sounds

 Sooo remmembur whiiilst youre young
 That the dayays to you will come
 When youre ooold and only in the way
 Do not scoff at them BEEcause

PENROD Miss Schofield stamped again

You DID say youd missed me said Mr Robert Williams seizing
hurriedly upon the silence Didnt you say

A livelier tune rose upward

 Oh you talk about your fascinating beauties
 Of your demOzells your belles
 But the littil dame I met while in the city
 Shes par excellaws the queen of all the swells
 Shes sweeter far

Margaret rose and jumped up and down repeatedly in a wellcalculated
area whereupon the voice of Penrod cried chokedly QUIT that and
there were subterranean coughings and sneezings

You want to choke a person to death he inquired severely appearing
at the end of the porch a cobweb upon his brow And continuing he
put into practice a newly acquired phrase You better learn to be more
considerick of other peoples comfort

Slowly and grievedly he withdrew passed to the sunny side of the house
reclined in the warm grass beside his wistful Duke and presently sang
again

 Shes sweeter far than the flower I named her after
 And the memery of her smile it haunts me YET
 When in after years the moon is soffly beamun
 And at eve I smell the smell of mignonette
 I will reCALL that

PenROD

Mr Schofield appeared at an open window upstairs a book in his hand

Stop it he commanded Cant I stay home with a headache ONE morning
from the office without having to listen toI never DID hear such
squawking He retired from the window having too impulsively called
upon his Maker Penrod shocked and injured entered the house but
presently his voice was again audible as far as the front porch He was
holding converse with his mother somewhere in the interior

Well what of it Sam Williams told me his mother said if Bob ever did
think of getting married to Margaret his mother said shed like to know
what in the name o goodness they expect to

Bang Margaret thought it better to close the front door

The next minute Penrod opened it I suppose you want the whole family
to get a sunstroke he said reprovingly Keepin every breath of air
out o the house on a day like this

And he sat down implacably in the doorway

The serious poetry of all languages has omitted the little brother
and yet he is one of the great trials of lovethe immemorial burden of
courtship Tragedy should have found place for him but he has been left
to the haphazard vignettist of Grub Street He is the grave and
real menace of lovers his head is sacred and terrible his power
illimitable There is one wayonly oneto deal with him but Robert
Williams having a brother of Penrods age understood that way

Robert had one dollar in the world He gave it to Penrod immediately

Enslaved forever the new Rockefeller rose and went forth upon the
highway an overflowing heart bursting the floodgates of song

 In her eyes the light of love was soffly gleamun
 So sweetlay
 So neatlay
 On the banks the moons soff light was brightly streamun
 Words of love I then spoke TO her
 She was purest of the PEWer
 Littil sweetheart do not sigh
 Do not weep and do not cry
 I will build a littil cottige just for yewEWEW and I

In fairness it must be called to mind that boys older than Penrod have
these wellings of pent melody a wife can never tell when she is to
undergo a musical morning and even the golden wedding brings her no
security a man of ninety is liable to bustloose in song any time

Invalids murmured pitifully as Penrod came within hearing and people
trying to think cursed the day that they were born when he went
shrilling by His hands in his pockets his shining face uplifted to the
sky of June he passed down the street singing his way into the hearts
deepest hatred of all who heard him

 One evuning I was sturowling
 Midst the city of the DEAD
 I viewed where all around me
 Their PEACEfull graves was SPREAD
 But that which touched me mostlay

He had reached his journeys end a junkdealers shop wherein lay
the longdesired treasure of his soulan accordion which might
have possessed a high quality of interest for an antiquarian being
unquestionably a ruin beautiful in decay and quite beyond the
sacrilegious reach of the restorer But it was still able to disgorge
soundsloud strange compelling sounds which could be heard for a
remarkable distance in all directions and it had one rich calflike
tone that had gone to Penrods heart He obtained the instrument for
twentytwo cents a price long since agreed upon with the junkdealer
who falsely claimed a loss of profit Shylock that he was He had found
the wreck in an alley

With this purchase suspended from his shoulder by a faded green cord
Penrod set out in a somewhat homeward direction but not by the route
he had just travelled though his motive for the change was not
humanitarian It was his desire to display himself thus troubadouring
to the gaze of Marjorie Jones Heralding his advance by continuous
experiments in the music of the future he pranced upon his blithesome
way the faithful Duke at his heels It was easier for Duke than it
would have been for a younger dog because with advancing age he had
begun to grow a little deaf

Turning the corner nearest to the glamoured mansion of the Joneses
the boy jongleur came suddenly face to face with Marjorie and in
the delicious surprise of the encounter ceased to play his hands in
agitation falling from the instrument

Bareheaded the sunshine glorious upon her amber curls Marjorie was
strolling handinhand with her baby brother Mitchell four years
old She wore pink that dayunforgettable pink with a broad black
patentleather belt shimmering reflections dancing upon its surface
How beautiful she was How sacred the sweet little baby brother whose
privilege it was to cling to that small hand delicately powdered with
freckles

Hello Marjorie said Penrod affecting carelessness

Hello said Marjorie with unexpected cordiality She bent over her
baby brother with motherly affectations Say howdy to the gentymuns
MitchyMitch she urged sweetly turning him to face Penrod

WONT said MitchyMitch and to emphasize his refusal kicked the
gentymuns upon the shin

Penrods feelings underwent instant change and in the sole occupation
of disliking MitchyMitch he wasted precious seconds which might have
been better employed in philosophic consideration of the startling
example just afforded of how a given law operates throughout the
universe in precisely the same manner perpetually Mr Robert Williams
would have understood this easily

Oh oh Marjorie cried and put MitchyMitch behind her with too much
sweetness Maurice Levys gone to Atlantic City with his mamma she
remarked conversationally as if the kicking incident were quite closed

Thats nothin returned Penrod keeping his eye uneasily
upon MitchyMitch I know plenty people been better places than
thatChicago and everywhere

There was unconscious ingratitude in his low rating of Atlantic City
for it was largely to the attractions of that resort he owed Miss Jones
present attitude of friendliness

Of course too she was curious about the accordion It would be
dastardly to hint that she had noticed a paper bag which bulged
the pocket of Penrods coat and yet this bag was undeniably
conspicuousand children are very like grown people sometimes

Penrod brought forth the bag purchased on the way at a drug store and
till this moment UNOPENED which expresses in a word the depth of his
sentiment for Marjorie It contained an abundant fifteencents worth of
lemon drops jawbreakers licorice sticks cinnamon drops and shopworn
choclate creams

Take all you want he said with offhand generosity

Why Penrod Schofield exclaimed the wholly thawed damsel you nice
boy

Oh thats nothin he returned airily I got a good deal of money
nowadays

Where from

Ohjust around With a cautious gesture he offered a jawbreaker to
MitchyMitch who snatched it indignantly and set about its absorption
without delay

Can you play on that asked Marjorie with some difficulty her cheeks
being rather too hilly for conversation

Want to hear me

She nodded her eyes sweet with anticipation

This was what he had come for He threw back his head lifted his eyes
dreamily as he had seen real musicians lift theirs and distended the
accordion preparing to produce the wonderful calflike noise which was
the instruments great charm

But the distention evoked a long wail which was at once drowned in
another one

Ow Owowaoh Wowohah WaowWOW shrieked MitchyMitch and the accordion
together

MitchyMitch to emphasize his disapproval of the accordion opening his
mouth still wider lost therefrom the jawbreaker which rolled in the
dust Weeping he stooped to retrieve it and Marjorie to prevent him
hastily set her foot upon it Penrod offered another jawbreaker but
MitchyMitch struck it from his hand desiring the former which had
convinced him of its sweetness

Marjorie moved inadvertently whereupon MitchyMitch pounced upon the
remains of his jawbreaker and restored them with accretions to his
mouth His sister uttering a cry of horror sprang to the rescue
assisted by Penrod whom she prevailed upon to hold MitchyMitchs mouth
open while she excavated This operation being completed and Penrods
right thumb severely bitten MitchyMitch closed his eyes tightly
stamped squealed bellowed wrung his hands and then unexpectedly
kicked Penrod again

Penrod put a hand in his pocket and drew forth a copper twocent piece
large round and fairly bright

He gave it to MitchyMitch

MitchyMitch immediately stopped crying and gazed upon his benefactor
with the eyes of a dog

This world

Thereafter did Penrodwith complete approval from MitchyMitchplay
the accordion for his lady to his hearts content and hers Never had
he so won upon her never had she let him feel so close to her before
They strolled up and down upon the sidewalk eating one thought between
them and soon she had learned to play the accordion almost as well as
he So passed a happy hour which the Good King Rene of Anjou would have
envied them while MitchyMitch made friends with Duke romped about his
sister and her swain and clung to the hand of the latter at intervals
with fondest affection and trust

The noon whistles failed to disturb this little Arcady only the
sound of Mrs Jones voice for the third time summoning Marjorie and
MitchyMitch to lunchsent Penrod on his way

I could come back this afternoon I guess he said in parting

Im not goin to be here Im goin to Baby Rennsdales party

Penrod looked blank as she intended he should Having thus satisfied
herself she added

There arent goin to be any boys there

He was instantly radiant again

Marjorie

Hum

Do you wish I was goin to be there

She looked shy and turned away her head

MARJORIE JONES This was a voice from home HOW MANY MORE TIMES
SHALL I HAVE TO CALL YOU

Marjorie moved away her face still hidden from Penrod

Do you he urged

At the gate she turned quickly toward him and said over her shoulder
all in a breath Yes Come again tomorrow morning and Ill be on the
corner Bring your cordion

And she ran into the house MitchyMitch waving a loving hand to the boy
on the sidewalk until the front door closed



CHAPTER XIX THE INNER BOY

Penrod went home in splendour pretending that he and Duke were a long
procession and he made enough noise to render the auricular part of the
illusion perfect His own family were already at the lunchtable when he
arrived and the parade halted only at the door of the diningroom

Oh SOMETHING shouted Mr Schofield clasping his bilious brow with
both hands Stop that noise Isnt it awful enough for you to SING Sit
DOWN Not with that thing on Take that green rope off your shoulder
Now take that thing out of the diningroom and throw it in the ashcan
Where did you get it

Where did I get what papa asked Penrod meekly depositing the
accordion in the hall just outside the diningroom door

That dathat thirdhand concertina

Its a cordian said Penrod taking his place at the table and
noticing that both Margaret and Mr Robert Williams who happened to be
a guest were growing red

I dont care what you call it said Mr Schofield irritably I want
to know where you got it

Penrods eyes met Margarets hers had a strained expression

She very slightly shook her head Penrod sent Mr Williams a grateful
look and might have been startled if he could have seen himself in a
mirror at that moment for he regarded MitchyMitch with concealed but
vigorous aversion and the resemblance would have horrified him

A man gave it to me he answered gently and was rewarded by the
visibly regained ease of his patrons manner while Margaret leaned back
in her chair and looked at her brother with real devotion

I should think hed have been glad to said Mr Schofield Who was
he

Sir In spite of the candy which he had consumed in company with
Marjorie and MitchyMitch Penrod had begun to eat lobster croquettes
earnestly

Who WAS he

Who do you mean papa

The man that gave you that ghastly Thing

Yessir A man gave it to me

I say Who WAS he shouted Mr Schofield

Well I was just walking along and the man came up to meit was right
down in front of Colgates where most of the paints rubbed off the
fence

Penrod The father used his most dangerous tone

Sir

Who was the man that gave you the concertina

I dont know I was walking along

You never saw him before

No sir I was just walk

That will do said Mr Schofield rising I suppose every family has
its secret enemies and this was one of ours I must ask to be excused

With that he went out crossly stopping in the hall a moment before
passing beyond hearing And after lunch Penrod sought in vain for his
accordion he even searched the library where his father sat reading
though upon inquiry Penrod explained that he was looking for a
misplaced schoolbook He thought he ought to study a little every day
he said even during vacationtime Much pleased Mr Schofield rose and
joined the search finding the missing work on mathematics with singular
easewhich cost him precisely the price of the book the following
September

Penrod departed to study in the backyard There after a cautious survey
of the neighbourhood he managed to dislodge the iron cover of the
cistern and dropped the arithmetic within A fine splash rewarded his
listening ear Thus assured that when he looked for that book again no
one would find it for him he replaced the cover and betook himself
pensively to the highway discouraging Duke from following by repeated
volleys of stones some imaginary and others all too real

Distant strains of brazen horns and the throbbing of drums were borne to
him upon the kind breeze reminding him that the world was made for joy
and that the Barzee and Potter Dog and Pony Show was exhibiting in a
banlieue not far away So thither he bent his stepsthe plentiful
funds in his pocket burning hot holes all the way He had paid
twentytwo cents for the accordion and fifteen for candy he had bought
the mercenary heart of MitchyMitch for two it certainly follows that
there remained to him of his dollar sixtyone centsa fair fortune
and most unusual

Arrived upon the populous and festive scene of the Dog and Pony Show
he first turned his attention to the brightly decorated booths which
surrounded the tent The cries of the peanut vendors of the popcorn
men of the toyballoon sellers the stirring music of the band playing
before the performance to attract a crowd the shouting of excited
children and the barking of the dogs within the tent all sounded
exhilaratingly in Penrods ears and set his blood atingle
Nevertheless he did not squander his money or fling it to the winds in
one grand splurge Instead he began cautiously with the purchase of an
extraordinarily large pickle which he obtained from an aged negress for
his odd cent too obvious a bargain to be missed At an adjacent stand
he bought a glass of raspberry lemonade so alleged and sipped it as he
ate the pickle He left nothing of either

Next he entered a small restauranttent and for a modest nickel was
supplied with a fork and a box of sardines previously opened it is
true but more than half full He consumed the sardines utterly but
left the tin box and the fork after which he indulged in an inexpensive
halfpint of lukewarm cider at one of the open booths Mug in hand
a gentle glow radiating toward his surface from various centres of
activity deep inside him he paused for breathand the cool sweet
cadences of the watermelon man fell delectably upon his ear

Icecole WATERmelon icecole waterMELON the biggest slice of
ICEcole ripe red ICEcole rich an rare the biggest slice of
icecole watermelon ever cut by the hand of man BUY our ICEcole
watermelon

Penrod having drained the last drop of cider complied with the
watermelon mans luscious entreaty and received a round slice of
the fruit magnificent in circumference and something over an inch in
thickness Leaving only the really dangerous part of the rind behind
him he wandered away from the vicinity of the watermelon man and
supplied himself with a bag of peanuts which with the expenditure of a
dime for admission left a quarter still warm in his pocket However he
managed to break the coin at a stand inside the tent where a large
oblong paper box of popcorn was handed him with twenty cents change
The box was too large to go into his pocket but having seated himself
among some wistful Polack children he placed it in his lap and devoured
the contents at leisure during the performance The popcorn was heavily
larded with partially boiled molasses and Penrod sandwiched mouthfuls
of peanuts with gobs of this mass until the peanuts were all gone After
that he ate with less avidity a sense almost of satiety beginning
to manifest itself to him and it was not until the close of the
performance that he disposed of the last morsel

He descended a little heavily to the outflowing crowd in the arena and
bought a caterwauling toy balloon but showed no great enthusiasm in
manipulating it Near the exit as he came out was a hotwaffle stand
which he had overlooked and a sense of duty obliged him to consume the
three waffles thickly powdered with sugar which the waffle man cooked
for him upon command

They left a hottish taste in his mouth they had not been quite up to
his anticipation indeed and it was with a sense of relief that he
turned to the hokeypokey cart which stood close at hand laden with
square slabs of Neapolitan icecream wrapped in paper He thought the
icecream would be cooling but somehow it fell short of the desired
effect and left a peculiar savour in his throat

He walked away too languid to blow his balloon and passed a
freshtaffy booth with strange indifference A barearmed man was
manipulating the taffy over a hook pulling a great white mass to the
desired stage of candying but Penrod did not pause to watch the
operation in fact he averted his eyes which were slightly glazed in
passing He did not analyze his motives simply he was conscious that
he preferred not to look at the mass of taffy

For some reason he put a considerable distance between himself and the
taffystand but before long halted in the presence of a redfaced man
who flourished a long fork over a small cooking apparatus and shouted
jovially Winnies HERES your hot winnies Hot winnyWURST Food for
the overworked brain nourishing for the weak stummick entertaining
for the tired business man HERES your hot winnies three for a nickel
a halfadime the twentiethpotofadollah

This above all nectar and ambrosia was the favourite dish of Penrod
Schofield Nothing inside him now craved iton the contrary But
memory is the great hypnotist his mind argued against his inwards that
opportunity knocked at his door winnywurst was rigidly forbidden by
the home authorities Besides there was a last nickel in his pocket
and nature protested against its survival Also the redfaced man had
himself proclaimed his wares nourishing for the weak stummick

Penrod placed the nickel in the red hand of the redfaced man

He ate two of the three greasy cigarlike shapes cordially pressed upon
him in return The first bite convinced him that he had made a mistake
these winnies seemed of a very inferior flavour almost unpleasant in
fact But he felt obliged to conceal his poor opinion of them for fear
of offending the redfaced man He ate without haste or eagernessso
slowly indeed that he began to think the redfaced man might dislike
him as a deterrent of trade Perhaps Penrods mind was not working
well for he failed to remember that no law compelled him to remain
under the eye of the redfaced man but the virulent repulsion excited
by his attempt to take a bite of the third sausage inspired him with at
least an excuse for postponement

Mighty good he murmured feebly placing the sausage in the pocket
of his jacket with a shaking hand Guess Ill save this one to eat at
home afterafter dinner

He moved sluggishly away wishing he had not thought of dinner A
sideshow undiscovered until now failed to arouse his interest not
even exciting a wish that he had known of its existence when he had
money For a time he stared without attraction the weatherworn colours
conveying no meaning to comprehension at a huge canvas poster depicting
the chief his torpid eye Then little by little the poster became more
vivid to his consciousness There was a greenishtinted person in the
tent it seemed who thrived upon a reptilian diet

Suddenly Penrod decided that it was time to go home



CHAPTER XX BROTHERS OF ANGELS

Indeed doctor said Mrs Schofield with agitation and profound
conviction just after eight oclock that evening I shall ALWAYS
believe in mustard plastersmustard plasters and hotwater bags If
it hadnt been for them I dont believed hed have LIVED till you got
hereI do NOT

Margaret called Mr Schofield from the open door of a bedroom
Margaret where did you put that aromatic ammonia Wheres Margaret

But he had to find the aromatic spirits of ammonia himself for Margaret
was not in the house She stood in the shadow beneath a maple tree
near the street corner a guitarcase in her hand and she scanned with
anxiety a briskly approaching figure The arc light swinging above
revealed this figure as that of him she awaited He was passing toward
the gate without seeing her when she arrested him with a fateful
whisper

BOB

Mr Robert Williams swung about hastily Why Margaret

Here take your guitar she whispered hurriedly I was afraid if
father happened to find it hed break it all to pieces

What for asked the startled Robert

Because Im sure he knows its yours But what

Oh Bob she moaned I was waiting here to tell you I was so afraid
youd try to come in

TRY exclaimed the unfortunate young man quite dumfounded TRY to
come

Yes before I warned you Ive been waiting here to tell you Bob you
mustnt come near the house if I were you Id stay away from even this
neighbourhoodfar away For a while I dont think it would be actually
SAFE for

Margaret will you please

Its all on account of that dollar you gave Penrod this morning she
walled First he bought that horrible concertina that made papa so
furious

But Penrod didnt tell that I

Oh wait she cried lamentably Listen He didnt tell at lunch but
he got home about dinnertime in the mostwell Ive seen pale people
before but nothing like Penrod Nobody could IMAGINE itnot unless
theyd seen him And he looked so STRANGE and kept making such
unnatural faces and at first all he would say was that hed eaten a
little piece of apple and thought it must have some microbes on it But
he got sicker and sicker and we put him to bedand then we all thought
he was going to dieand of COURSE no little piece of apple would
havewell and he kept getting worse and then he said hed had a
dollar He said hed spent it for the concertina and watermelon and
chocolatecreams and licorice sticks and lemondrops and peanuts
and jawbreakers and sardines and raspberry lemonade and pickles and
popcorn and icecream and cider and sausagethere was sausage in
his pocket and mamma says his jacket is ruinedand cinnamon dropsand
wafflesand he ate four or five lobster croquettes at lunchand papa
said Who gave you that dollar Only he didnt say WHOhe said
something horrible Bob And Penrod thought he was going to die and he
said you gave it to him and oh it was just pitiful to hear the poor
child Bob because he thought he was dying you see and he blamed you
for the whole thing He said if youd only let him alone and not given
it to him hed have grown up to be a good manand now he couldnt I
never heard anything so heartrendinghe was so weak he could hardly
whisper but he kept trying to talk telling us over and over it was all
your fault

In the darkness Mr Williams facial expression could not be seen but
his voice sounded hopeful

Is heis he still in a great deal of pain

They say the crisis is past said Margaret but the doctors still
up there He said it was the acutest case of indigestion he had ever
treated in the whole course of his professional practice

Of course _I_ didnt know what hed do with the dollar said Robert

She did not reply

He began plaintively Margaret you dont

Ive never seen papa and mamma so upset about anything she said
rather primly

You mean theyre upset about ME

We ARE all very much upset returned Margaret more starch in her tone
as she remembered not only Penrods sufferings but a duty she had vowed
herself to perform

Margaret YOU dont

Robert she said firmly and also with a rhetorical complexity which
breeds a suspicion of prerehearsalRobert for the present I can only
look at it in one way when you gave that money to Penrod you put into
the hands of an unthinking little child a weapon which might be and
indeed was the means of his undoing Boys are not respon

But you saw me give him the dollar and you didnt

Robert she checked him with increasing severity I am only a woman
and not accustomed to thinking everything out on the spur of the moment
but I cannot change my mind Not now at least

And you think Id better not come in tonight

Tonight she gasped Not for WEEKS Papa would

But Margaret he urged plaintively how can you blame me for

I have not used the word blame she interrupted But I must insist
that for your carelessness toto wreak such havoccannot fail toto
lessen my confidence in your powers of judgment I cannot change my
convictions in this matternot tonightand I cannot remain here
another instant The poor child may need me Robert goodnight

With chill dignity she withdrew entered the house and returned to the
sickroom leaving the young man in outer darkness to brood upon his
crimeand upon Penrod


That sincere invalid became convalescent upon the third day and a
week elapsed then before he found an opportunity to leave the house
unaccompaniedsave by Duke But at last he set forth and approached the
Jones neighbourhood in high spirits pleasantly conscious of his pallor
hollow cheeks and other perquisites of illness provocative of interest

One thought troubled him a little because it gave him a sense of
inferiority to a rival He believed against his will that Maurice
Levy could have successfully eaten chocolatecreams licorice sticks
lemondrops jawbreakers peanuts waffles lobster croquettes
sardines cinnamondrops watermelon pickles popcorn icecream
and sausage with raspberry lemonade and cider Penrod had admitted to
himself that Maurice could do it and afterward attend to business or
pleasure without the slightest discomfort and this was probably no
more than a fair estimate of one of the great constitutions of all time
As a digester Maurice Levy would have disappointed a Borgia

Fortunately Maurice was still at Atlantic Cityand now the
convalescents heart leaped In the distance he saw Marjorie comingin
pink again with a ravishing little parasol over her head And alone No
MitchyMitch was to mar this meeting

Penrod increased the feebleness of his steps now and then leaning upon
the fence as if for support

How do you do Marjorie he said in his best sickroom voice as she
came near

To his pained amazement she proceeded on her way her nose at a
celebrated elevationan icy nose

She cut him dead

He threw his invalids airs to the winds and hastened after her

Marjorie he pleaded whats the matter Are you mad Honest that
day you said to come back next morning and youd be on the corner
I was sick Honest I was AWFUL sick Marjorie I had to have the
doctor

DOCTOR She whirled upon him her lovely eyes blazing

I guess WEVE had to have the doctor enough at OUR house thanks to
you Mister Penrod Schofield Papa says you havent got NEAR sense
enough to come in out of the rain after what you did to poor little
MitchyMitch

What

Yes and hes sick in bed YET Marjorie went on with unabated fury
And papa says if he ever catches you in this part of town

WHATD I do to MitchyMitch gasped Penrod

You know well enough what you did to MitchyMitch she cried You
gave him that great big nasty twocent piece

Well what of it

MitchyMitch swallowed it

What

And papa says if he ever just lays eyes on you once in this
neighbourhood

But Penrod had started for home

In his embittered heart there was increasing a critical disapproval of
the Creators methods When He made pretty girls thought Penrod why
couldnt He have left out their little brothers



CHAPTER XXI RUPE COLLINS

For several days after this Penrod thought of growing up to be a
monk and engaged in good works so far as to carry some kittens that
otherwise would have been drowned and a pair of Margarets outworn
dancingslippers to a poor ungrateful old man sojourning in a shed
up the alley And although Mr Robert Williams after a very short
interval began to leave his guitar on the front porch again exactly as
if he thought nothing had happened Penrod with his younger vision of
a fathers mood remained coldly distant from the Jones neighbourhood
With his own family his manner was gentle proud and sad but not for
long enough to frighten them The change came with mystifying abruptness
at the end of the week

It was Duke who brought it about

Duke could chase a much bigger dog out of the Schofields yard and far
down the street This might be thought to indicate unusual valour on
the part of Duke and cowardice on that of the bigger dogs whom he
undoubtedly put to rout On the contrary all such flights were founded
in mere superstition for dogs are even more superstitious than boys
and coloured people and the most firmly established of all dog
superstitions is that any dogbe he the smallest and feeblest in the
worldcan whip any trespasser whatsoever

A ratterrier believes that on his home grounds he can whip an elephant
It follows of course that a big dog away from his own home will run
from a little dog in the little dogs neighbourhood Otherwise the big
dog must face a charge of inconsistency and dogs are as consistent as
they are superstitious A dog believes in war but he is convinced
that there are times when it is moral to run and the thoughtful
physiognomist seeing a big dog fleeing out of a little dogs yard must
observe that the expression of the big dogs face is more conscientious
than alarmed it is the expression of a person performing a duty to
himself

Penrod understood these matters perfectly he knew that the gaunt brown
hound Duke chased up the alley had fled only out of deference to a
custom yet Penrod could not refrain from bragging of Duke to the
hounds owner a fatfaced stranger of twelve or thirteen who had
wandered into the neighbourhood

You better keep that ole yellow dog o yours back said Penrod
ominously as he climbed the fence You better catch him and hold him
till I get mine inside the yard again Dukes chewed up some pretty bad
bulldogs around here

The fatfaced boy gave Penrod a fishy stare Youd oughta learn him not
to do that he said Itll make him sick

What will

The stranger laughed raspingly and gazed up the alley where the hound
having come to a halt now coolly sat down and with an expression of
roguish benevolence patronizingly watched the tempered fury of Duke
whose assaults and barkings were becoming perfunctory

Whatll make Duke sick Penrod demanded

Eatin dead bulldogs people leave around here

This was not improvisation but formula adapted from other occasions to
the present encounter nevertheless it was new to Penrod and he was
so taken with it that resentment lost itself in admiration Hastily
committing the gem to memory for use upon a dogowning friend he
inquired in a sociable tone

Whats your dogs name

Dan You better call your ole pup cause Dan eats LIVE dogs

Dans actions poorly supported his masters assertion for upon Dukes
ceasing to bark Dan rose and showed the most courteous interest in
making the little old dogs acquaintance Dan had a great deal of
manner and it became plain that Duke was impressed favourably in spite
of former prejudice so that presently the two trotted amicably back to
their masters and sat down with the harmonious but indifferent air of
having known each other intimately for years

They were received without comment though both boys looked at them
reflectively for a time It was Penrod who spoke first

What number you go to In an oral lesson in English Penrod had
been instructed to put this question in another form May I ask which
of our public schools you attend

Me What number do I go to said the stranger contemptuously I
dont go to NO number in vacation

I mean when it aint

Third returned the fatfaced boy I got em ALL scared in THAT
school

What of innocently asked Penrod to whom the Thirdin a distant
part of townwas undiscovered country

What of I guess youd soon see what of if you ever was in that school
about one day Youd be lucky if you got out alive

Are the teachers mean

The other boy frowned with bitter scorn Teachers Teachers dont order
ME around I can tell you Theyre mighty careful how they try to run
over Rupe Collins

Whos Rupe Collins

Who is he echoed the fatfaced boy incredulously Say aint you got
ANY sense

What

Say wouldnt you be just as happy if you had SOME sense

Yees Penrods answer like the look he lifted to the impressive
stranger was meek and placative Rupe Collins is the principal at your
school guess

The other yelled with jeering laughter and mocked Penrods manner and
voice Rupe Collins is the principal at your school I guess He
laughed harshly again then suddenly showed truculence Say bo
whynt you learn enough to go in the house when it rains Whats the
matter of you anyhow

Well urged Penrod timidly nobody ever TOLD me who Rupe Collins is
I got a RIGHT to think hes the principal havent I

The fatfaced boy shook his head disgustedly Honest you make me
sick

Penrods expression became one of despair Well who IS he he cried

Who IS he mocked the other with a scorn that withered Who IS
he ME

Oh Penrod was humiliated but relieved he felt that he had proved
himself criminally ignorant yet a peril seemed to have passed Rupe
Collins is your name then I guess I kind of thought it was all the
time

The fatfaced boy still appeared embittered burlesquing this speech in
a hateful falsetto Rupe Collins is YOUR name then I guess Oh you
kind of thought it was all the time did you Suddenly concentrating
his brow into a histrionic scowl he thrust his face within an inch of
Penrods Yes sonny Rupe Collins is my name and you better look
out what you say when hes around or youll get in big trouble YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT BO

Penrod was cowed but fascinated he felt that there was something
dangerous and dashing about this newcomer

Yes he said feebly drawing back My names Penrod Schofield

Then I reckon your father and mother aint got good sense said Mr
Collins promptly this also being formula

Why

Cause if they had theyd of give you a good name And the agreeable
youth instantly rewarded himself for the wit with another yell of
rasping laughter after which he pointed suddenly at Penrods right
hand

Whered you get that wart on your finger he demanded severely

Which finger asked the mystified Penrod extending his hand

The middle one

Where

There exclaimed Rupe Collins seizing and vigorously twisting the
wartless finger naively offered for his inspection

Quit shouted Penrod in agony QUEEyut

Say your prayers commanded Rupe and continued to twist the luckless
finger until Penrod writhed to his knees

OW The victim released looked grievously upon the still painful
finger

At this Rupes scornful expression altered to one of contrition Well
I declare he exclaimed remorsefully I didnt spose it would hurt
Turn abouts fair play so now you do that to me

He extended the middle finger of his left hand and Penrod promptly
seized it but did not twist it for he was instantly swung round with
his back to his amiable new acquaintance Rupes right hand operated
upon the back of Penrods slender neck Rupes knee tortured the small
of Penrods back

OW Penrod bent far forward involuntarily and went to his knees again

Lick dirt commanded Rupe forcing the captives face to the sidewalk
and the suffering Penrod completed this ceremony

Mr Collins evinced satisfaction by means of his horse laugh

Youd last jest about one day up at the Third he said Youd come
runnin home yellin MOMMUH MOMmuh before recess was over

No I wouldnt Penrod protested rather weakly dusting his knees

You would too

No I w

Looky here said the fatfaced boy darkly what you mean
counterdicking me

He advanced a step and Penrod hastily qualified his contradiction

I mean I dont THINK I would I

You better look out Rupe moved closer and unexpectedly grasped the
back of Penrods neck again Say I WOULD run home yellin MOMmuh

Ow I WOULD run home yellin Mommuh

There said Rupe giving the helpless nape a final squeeze Thats
the way we do up at the Third

Penrod rubbed his neck and asked meekly

Can you do that to any boy up at the Third

See here now said Rupe in the tone of one goaded beyond all
endurance YOU say if I can You better say it quick or

I knew you could Penrod interposed hastily with the pathetic
semblance of a laugh I only said that in fun

In fun repeated Rupe stormily You better look out how you

Well I SAID I wasnt in earnest Penrod retreated a few steps _I_
knew you could all the time I expect _I_ could do it to some of the
boys up at the Third myself Couldnt I

No you couldnt

Well there must be SOME boy up there that I could

No they aint You better

I expect not then said Penrod quickly

You BETTER expect not Didnt I tell you once youd never get back
alive if you ever tried to come up around the Third You want me to SHOW
you how we do up there bo

He began a slow and deadly advance whereupon Penrod timidly offered a
diversion

Say Rupe I got a box of rats in our stable under a glass cover so
you can watch em jump around when you hammer on the box Come on and
look at em

All right said the fatfaced boy slightly mollified Well let Dan
kill em

No SIR Im goin to keep em Theyre kind of pets Ive had em all
summerI got names for em and

Looky here bo Did you hear me say well let Dan kill em

Yes but I wont

WHAT wont you Rupe became sinister immediately It seems to me
youre gettin pretty fresh around here

Well I dont want

Mr Collins once more brought into play the dreadful eyetoeye scowl as
practised up at the Third and sometimes also by young leading
men upon the stage Frowning appallingly and thrusting forward his
underlip he placed his nose almost in contact with the nose of Penrod
whose eyes naturally became crossed

Dan kills the rats See hissed the fatfaced boy maintaining the
horrible juxtaposition

Well all right said Penrod swallowing I dont want em much
And when the pose had been relaxed he stared at his new friend for a
moment almost with reverence Then he brightened

Come on Rupe he cried enthusiastically as he climbed the fence
Well give our dogs a little live meatbo



CHAPTER XXII THE IMITATOR

At the dinnertable that evening Penrod Surprised his family by
remarking in a voice they had never heard him attempta lawgiving
voice of intentional gruffness

Any man thats makin a hunderd dollars a month is makin good money

What asked Mr Schofield staring for the previous conversation had
concerned the illness of an infant relative in Council Bluffs

Any man thats makin a hunderd dollars a month is makin good money

What IS he talking about Margaret appealed to the invisible

Well said Penrod frowning thats what foremen at the ladder works
get

How in the world do you know asked his mother

Well I KNOW it A hunderd dollars a month is good money I tell you

Well what of it said the father impatiently

Nothin I only said it was good money

Mr Schofield shook his head dismissing the subject and here he made
a mistake he should have followed up his sons singular contribution
to the conversation That would have revealed the fact that there was a
certain Rupe Collins whose father was a foreman at the ladder works All
clues are important when a boy makes his first remark in a new key

Good money repeated Margaret curiously What is good money

Penrod turned upon her a stern glance Say wouldnt you be just as
happy if you had SOME sense

Penrod shouted his father But Penrods mother gazed with dismay at
her son he had never before spoken like that to his sister

Mrs Schofield might have been more dismayed than she was if she had
realized that it was the beginning of an epoch After dinner Penrod was
slightly scalded in the back as the result of telling Della the cook
that there was a wart on the middle finger of her right hand Della thus
proving poor material for his new manner to work upon he approached
Duke in the backyard and bending double seized the lowly animal by
the forepaws

I let you know my names Penrod Schofield hissed the boy He
protruded his underlip ferociously scowled and thrust forward his head
until his nose touched the dogs And you better look out when Penrod
Schofields around or youll get in big trouble YOU UNDERSTAN THAT
BO

The next day and the next the increasing change in Penrod puzzled and
distressed his family who had no idea of its source

How might they guess that heroworship takes such forms They were
vaguely conscious that a rather shabby boy not of the neighbourhood
came to play with Penrod several times but they failed to connect
this circumstance with the peculiar behaviour of the son of the house
whose ideals his father remarked seemed to have suddenly become
identical with those of Gyp the Blood

Meanwhile for Penrod himself life had taken on new meaning new
richness He had become a fighting manin conversation at least Do
you want to know how I do when they try to slip up on me from behind
he asked Della And he enacted for her unappreciative eye a scene of
fistic manoeuvres wherein he held an imaginary antagonist helpless in a
net of stratagems

Frequently when he was alone he would outwit and pummel this same
enemy and after a cunning feint land a dolorous stroke full upon a
face of air There I guess youll know better next time Thats the
way we do up at the Third

Sometimes in solitary pantomime he encountered more than one opponent
at a time for numbers were apt to come upon him treacherously
especially at a little after his rising hour when he might be caught at
a disadvantageperhaps standing on one leg to encase the other in his
knickerbockers Like lightning he would hurl the trapping garment from
him and ducking and pivoting deal great sweeping blows among the
circle of sneaking devils That was how he broke the clock in his
bedroom And while these battles were occupying his attention it was
a waste of voice to call him to breakfast though if his mother losing
patience came to his room she would find him seated on the bed pulling
at a stocking Well aint I coming fast as I CAN

At the table and about the house generally he was bumptious loud with
fatuous misinformation and assumed a domineering tone which neither
satire nor reproof seemed able to reduce but it was among his own
intimates that his new superiority was most outrageous He twisted the
fingers and squeezed the necks of all the boys of the neighbourhood
meeting their indignation with a hoarse and rasping laugh he had
acquired after short practice in the stable where he jeered and taunted
the lawnmower the gardenscythe and the wheelbarrow quite out of
countenance

Likewise he bragged to the other boys by the hour Rupe Collins being
the chief subject of encomiumnext to Penrod himself Thats the
way we do up at the Third became staple explanation of violence for
Penrod like Tartarin was plastic in the hands of his own imagination
and at times convinced himself that he really was one of those dark
and murderous spirits exclusively of whom the Third was
composedaccording to Rupe Collins

Then when Penrod had exhausted himself repeating to nausea accounts of
the prowess of himself and his great friend he would turn to two other
subjects for vainglory These were his father and Duke

Mothers must accept the fact that between babyhood and manhood their
sons do not boast of them The boy with boys is a Choctaw and either
the influence or the protection of women is shameful Your mother wont
let you is an insult But My father wont let me is a dignified
explanation and cannot be hooted A boy is ruined among his fellows if
he talks much of his mother or sisters and he must recognize it as
his duty to offer at least the appearance of persecution to all things
ranked as female such as cats and every species of fowl But he must
champion his father and his dog and ever ready to pit either against
any challenger must picture both as ravening for battle and absolutely
unconquerable

Penrod of course had always talked by the code but under the new
stimulus Duke was represented virtually as a cross between Bob Son of
Battle and a South American vampire and this in spite of the fact that
Duke himself often sat close by a living lie with the hope of peace
in his heart As for Penrods father that gladiator was painted as of
sentiments and dimensions suitable to a superdemon composed of equal
parts of Goliath Jack Johnson and the Emperor Nero

Even Penrods walk was affected he adopted a gait which was a kind of
taunting swagger and when he passed other children on the street he
practised the habit of feinting a blow then as the victim dodged
he rasped the triumphant horse laugh which he gradually mastered to
horrible perfection He did this to Marjorie Jonesay this was
their next meeting and such is Eros young What was even worse in
Marjories opinion he went on his way without explanation and left
her standing on the corner talking about it long after he was out of
hearing

Within five days from his first encounter with Rupe Collins Penrod had
become unbearable He even almost alienated Sam Williams who for a time
submitted to finger twisting and neck squeezing and the new style of
conversation but finally declared that Penrod made him sick He made
the statement with fervour one sultry afternoon in Mr Schofields
stable in the presence of Herman and Verman

You better look out bo said Penrod threateningly Ill show you a
little how we do up at the Third

Up at the Third Sam repeated with scorn You havent ever been up
there

I havent cried Penrod I HAVENT

No you havent

Looky here Penrod darkly argumentative prepared to perform the
eyetoeye business When havent I been up there

You havent NEVER been up there In spite of Penrods closely
approaching nose Sam maintained his ground and appealed for
confirmation Has he Herman

I don reckon so said Herman laughing

WHAT Penrod transferred his nose to the immediate vicinity of
Hermans nose You dont reckon so bo dont you You better look out
how you reckon around here YOU UNDERSTAN THAT BO

Herman bore the eyetoeye very well indeed it seemed to please
him for he continued to laugh while Verman chuckled delightedly The
brothers had been in the country picking berries for a week and it
happened that this was their first experience of the new manifestation
of Penrod

HAVENT I been up at the Third the sinister Penrod demanded

I don reckon so How come you ast ME

Didnt you just hear me SAY I been up there

Well said Herman mischievously hearin aint believin

Penrod clutched him by the back of the neck but Herman laughing
loudly ducked and released himself at once retreating to the wall

You take that back Penrod shouted striking out wildly

Don git mad begged the small darky while a number of blows falling
upon his warding arms failed to abate his amusement and a sound one
upon the cheek only made him laugh the more unrestrainedly He behaved
exactly as if Penrod were tickling him and his brother Verman rolled
with joy in a wheelbarrow Penrod pummelled till he was tired and
produced no greater effect

There he panted desisting finally NOW I reckon you know whether I
been up there or not

Herman rubbed his smitten cheek Pow he exclaimed Powee You
certny did lan me good one NAT time Ooee she HURT

Youll get hurt worsen that Penrod assured him if you stay around
here much Rupe Collins is comin this afternoon he said Were goin
to make some policemens billies out of the rake handle

You go spoil new rake you pa bought

What do WE care I and Rupe got to have billies havent we

How you make em

Melt lead and pour in a hole were goin to make in the end of em
Then were goin to carry em in our pockets and if anybody says
anything to usOH oh look out They wont get a crack on the
headOH no

Whens Rupe Collins coming Sam Williams inquired rather uneasily
He had heard a great deal too much of this personage but as yet the
pleasure of actual acquaintance had been denied him

Hes liable to be here any time answered Penrod You better look
out Youll be lucky if you get home alive if you stay till HE comes

I aint afraid of him Sam returned conventionally

You are too There was some truth in the retort There aint any
boy in this part of town but me that wouldnt be afraid of him Youd be
afraid to talk to him You wouldnt get a word out of your mouth before
old Rupied have you where youd wished you never come around HIM
lettin on like you was so much YOU wouldnt run home yellin Mommuh
or nothin OH no

Who Rupe Collins asked Herman

Who Rupe Collins Penrod mocked and used his rasping laugh but
instead of showing fright Herman appeared to think he was meant to
laugh too and so he did echoed by Verman You just hang around here
a little while longer Penrod added grimly and youll find out who
Rupe Collins is and I pity YOU when you do

What he go do

Youll see thats all You just wait and

At this moment a brown hound ran into the stable through the alley door
wagged a greeting to Penrod and fraternized with Duke The fatfaced
boy appeared upon the threshold and gazed coldly about the little
company in the carriagehouse whereupon the coloured brethren ceasing
from merriment were instantly impassive and Sam Williams moved a
little nearer the door leading into the yard

Obviously Sam regarded the newcomer as a redoubtable if not ominous
figure He was a head taller than either Sam or Penrod head and
shoulders taller than Herman who was short for his age and Verman
could hardly be used for purposes of comparison at all being a mere
squat brown spot not yet quite nine years on this planet And to
Sams mind the aspect of Mr Collins realized Penrods portentous
foreshadowings Upon the fat face there was an expression of truculent
intolerance which had been cultivated by careful habit to such
perfection that Sams heart sank at sight of it A somewhat enfeebled
twin to this expression had of late often decorated the visage of
Penrod and appeared upon that ingenuous surface now as he advanced to
welcome the eminent visitor

The host swaggered toward the door with a great deal of shoulder
movement carelessly feinting a slap at Verman in passing and creating
by various means the atmosphere of a man who has contemptuously amused
himself with underlings while awaiting an equal

Hello bo Penrod said in the deepest voice possible to him

Who you callin bo was the ungracious response accompanied by
immediate action of a similar nature Rupe held Penrods head in the
crook of an elbow and massaged his temples with a hardpressing knuckle

I was only in fun Rupie pleaded the sufferer and then being set
free Come here Sam he said

What for

Penrod laughed pityingly Pshaw I aint goin to hurt you Come on
Sam maintaining his position near the other door Penrod went to him
and caught him round the neck

Watch me Rupie Penrod called and performed upon Sam the knuckle
operation which he had himself just undergone Sam submitting
mechanically his eyes fixed with increasing uneasiness upon Rupe
Collins Sam had a premonition that something even more painful than
Penrods knuckle was going to be inflicted upon him

THAT don hurt said Penrod pushing him away

Yes it does too Sam rubbed his temple

Puh It didnt hurt me did it Rupie Come on in Rupe show this baby
where hes got a wart on his finger

You showed me that trick Sam objected You already did that to
me You tried it twice this afternoon and I dont know how many times
before only you werent strong enough after the first time Anyway I
know what it is and I dont

Come on Rupe said Penrod Make the baby lick dirt

At this bidding Rupe approached while Sam still protesting moved to
the threshold of the outer door but Penrod seized him by the shoulders
and swung him indoors with a shout

Little baby wants to run home to its Mommuh Here he is Rupie

Thereupon was Penrods treachery to an old comrade properly rewarded
for as the two struggled Rupe caught each by the back of the neck
simultaneously and with creditable impartiality forced both boys to
their knees

Lick dirt he commanded forcing them still forward until their faces
were close to the stable floor

At this moment he received a real surprise With a loud whack something
struck the back of his head and turning he beheld Verman in the act
of lifting a piece of lath to strike again

Em moys ome said Verman the Giant Killer

He tonguetie Herman explained He say let em boys alone

Rupe addressed his host briefly

Chase them nigs out o here

Don call me nig said Herman I mine my own biznuss You let em
boys alone

Rupe strode across the still prostrate Sam stepped upon Penrod and
equipping his countenance with the terrifying scowl and protruded jaw
lowered his head to the level of Hermans

Nig youll be lucky if you leave here alive And he leaned forward
till his nose was within less than an inch of Hermans nose

It could be felt that something awful was about to happen and Penrod
as he rose from the floor suffered an unexpected twinge of apprehension
and remorse he hoped that Rupe wouldnt REALLY hurt Herman A sudden
dislike of Rupe and Rupes ways rose within him as he looked at the big
boy overwhelming the little darky with that ferocious scowl Penrod
all at once felt sorry about something indefinable and with equal
vagueness he felt foolish Come on Rupe he suggested feebly let
Herman go and lets us make our billies out of the rake handle

The rake handle however was not available if Rupe had inclined to
favour the suggestion Verman had discarded his lath for the rake which
he was at this moment lifting in the air

You ole black nigger the fatfaced boy said venomously to Herman
Im agoin to

But he had allowed his nose to remain too long near Hermans

Penrods familiar nose had been as close with only a ticklish spinal
effect upon the not very remote descendant of Congo maneaters The
result produced by the glare of Rupes unfamiliar eyes and by
the dreadfully suggestive proximity of Rupes unfamiliar nose was
altogether different Hermans and Vermans Bangala greatgrandfathers
never considered people of their own jungle neighbourhood proper
material for a meal but they looked upon strangers especially truculent
strangersas distinctly edible

Penrod and Sam heard Rupe suddenly squawk and bellow saw him writhe and
twist and fling out his arms like flails though without removing his
face from its juxtaposition indeed for a moment the two heads seemed
even closer

Then they separatedand battle was on



CHAPTER XXIII COLOURED TROOPS IN ACTION

How neat and pure is the task of the chronicler who has the tale to tell
of a good rousing fight between boys or men who fight in the good old
English way according to a model set for fights in books long before
Tom Brown went to Rugby There are seconds and rounds and rules of
fairplay and always there is great good feeling in the endthough
sometimes to vary the model the Butcher defeats the heroand the
chronicler who stencils this fine old pattern on his page is certain of
applause as the stirrer of red blood There is no surer recipe

But when Herman and Verman set to t the record must be no more than a
few fragments left by the expurgator It has been perhaps sufficiently
suggested that the altercation in Mr Schofields stable opened with
mayhem in respect to the aggressors nose Expressing vocally his
indignation and the extremity of his pained surprise Mr Collins
stepped backward holding his left hand over his nose and striking at
Herman with his right Then Verman hit him with the rake

Verman struck from behind He struck as hard as he could And he struck
with the tines downFor in his simple direct African way he wished to
kill his enemy and he wished to kill him as soon as possible That was
his single earnest purpose

On this account Rupe Collins was peculiarly unfortunate He was plucky
and he enjoyed conflict but neither his ambitions nor his anticipations
had ever included murder He had not learned that an habitually
aggressive person runs the danger of colliding with beings in one of
those lower stages of evolution wherein theories about hitting below
the belt have not yet made their appearance

The rake glanced from the back of Rupes head to his shoulder but it
felled him Both darkies jumped full upon him instantly and the three
rolled and twisted upon the stablefloor unloosing upon the air sincere
maledictions closely connected with complaints of cruel and unusual
treatment while certain expressions of feeling presently emanating from
Herman and Verman indicated that Rupe Collins in this extremity was
proving himself not too slavishly addicted to fighting by rule Dan and
Duke mistaking all for mirth barked gayly

From the panting pounding yelling heap issued words and phrases
hitherto quite unknown to Penrod and Sam also a hoarse repetition
in the voice of Rupe concerning his ear left it not to be doubted
that additional mayhem was taking place Appalled the two spectators
retreated to the doorway nearest the yard where they stood dumbly
watching the cataclysm

The struggle increased in primitive simplicity time and again the
howling Rupe got to his knees only to go down again as the earnest
brothers in their own way assisted him to a more reclining position
Primal forces operated here and the two blanched slightly higher
products of evolution Sam and Penrod no more thought of interfering
than they would have thought of interfering with an earthquake

At last out of the ruck rose Verman disfigured and maniacal With a
wild eye he looked about him for his trusty rake but Penrod in horror
had long since thrown the rake out into the yard Naturally it had not
seemed necessary to remove the lawnmower

The frantic eye of Verman fell upon the lawnmower and instantly
he leaped to its handle Shrilling a wordless warcry he charged
propelling the whirling deafening knives straight upon the prone
legs of Rupe Collins The lawnmower was sincerely intended to pass
longitudinally over the body of Mr Collins from heel to head and it
was the time for a deathsong Black Valkyrie hovered in the shrieking
air

Cut his gizzud out shrieked Herman urging on the whirling knives

They touched and lacerated the shin of Rupe as with the supreme agony
of effort a creature in mortal peril puts forth before succumbing he
tore himself free of Herman and got upon his feet

Herman was up as quickly He leaped to the wall and seized the
gardenscythe that hung there

Im go to cut you gizzud out he announced definitely an eat it

Rupe Collins had never run from anybody except his father in his life
he was not a coward but the present situation was very very unusual
He was already in a badly dismantled condition and yet Herman and
Verman seemed discontented with their work Verman was swinging the
grasscutter about for a new charge apparently still wishing to mow
him and Herman had made a quite plausible statement about what he
intended to do with the scythe

Rupe paused but for an extremely condensed survey of the horrible
advance of the brothers and then uttering a bloodcurdled scream of
fear ran out of the stable and up the alley at a speed he had never
before attained so that even Dan had hard work to keep within barking
distance And a crossshoulder glance at the corner revealing Verman
and Herman in pursuit the latter waving his scythe overhead Mr
Collins slackened not his gait but rather out of great anguish
increased it the while a rapidly developing purpose became firm in his
mindand ever after so remainednot only to refrain from visiting that
neighbourhood again but never by any chance to come within a mile of
it

From the alley door Penrod and Sam watched the flight and were without
words When the pursuit rounded the corner the two looked wanly at
each other but neither spoke until the return of the brothers from the
chase

Herman and Verman came back laughing and chuckling

Hiyi cackled Herman to Verman as they came See at ole boy run

Whoee Verman shouted in ecstasy

Nev did see boy run so fas Herman continued tossing the scythe
into the wheelbarrow I bet he home in bed by viss time

Verman roared with delight appearing to be wholly unconscious that the
lids of his right eye were swollen shut and that his attire not too
finical before the struggle now entitled him to unquestioned rank as a
sansculotte Herman was a similar ruin and gave as little heed to his
condition

Penrod looked dazedly from Herman to Verman and back again So did Sam
Williams

Herman said Penrod in a weak voice you wouldnt HONEST of cut his
gizzard out would you

Who Me I don know He mighty mean ole boy Herman shook his head
gravely and then observing that Verman was again convulsed with
unctuous merriment joined laughter with his brother Sho I guess I
uz dess TALKIN whens I said at Reckon he thought I meant it fm de
way he tuck an run Hiyi Reckon he thought ole Herman bad man No
suh I uz dess talkin cause I nev would cut NObody I ain tryin
git in no jailNO suh

Penrod looked at the scythe he looked at Herman He looked at the
lawnmower and he looked at Verman Then he looked out in the yard at
the rake So did Sam Williams

Come on Verman said Herman We ain go at stovewood f supper
yit

Giggling reminiscently the brothers disappeared leaving silence behind
them in the carriagehouse Penrod and Sam retired slowly into the
shadowy interior each glancing now and then with a preoccupied air
at the open empty doorway where the late afternoon sunshine was growing
ruddy At intervals one or the other scraped the floor reflectively
with the side of his shoe Finally still without either having made
any effort at conversation they went out into the yard and stood
continuing their silence

Well said Sam at last I guess its time I better be gettin home
So long Penrod

So long Sam said Penrod feebly

With a solemn gaze he watched his friend out of sight Then he went
slowly into the house and after an interval occupied in a unique
manner appeared in the library holding a pair of brilliantly gleaming
shoes in his hand

Mr Schofield reading the evening paper glanced frowningly over it at
his offspring

Look papa said Penrod I found your shoes where youd taken em
off in your room to put on your slippers and they were all dusty So I
took em out on the back porch and gave em a good blacking They shine
up fine dont they

Well Ill be dduddummed said the startled Mr Schofield

Penrod was zigzagging back to normal



CHAPTER XXIV LITTLE GENTLEMAN

The midsummer sun was stinging hot outside the little barbershop next
to the corner drug store and Penrod undergoing a toilette preliminary
to his very slowly approaching twelfth birthday was adhesive enough to
retain upon his face much hair as it fell from the shears There is a
mystery here the tonsorial processes are not unagreeable to manhood in
truth they are soothing but the hairs detached from a boys head get
into his eyes his ears his nose his mouth and down his neck and he
does everywhere itch excruciatingly Wherefore he blinks winks weeps
twitches condenses his countenance and squirms and perchance the
barbers scissors clip more than intendedbelike an outlying flange of
ear

UmmuhOW said Penrod this thing having happened

D I touch y up a little inquired the barber smiling falsely

OohUH The boy in the chair offered inarticulate protest as the
wound was rubbed with alum

THAT dont hurt said the barber You WILL get it though if you
dont sit stiller he continued nipping in the bud any attempt on the
part of his patient to think that he already had it

Pfuff said Penrod meaning no disrespect but endeavoring to dislodge
a temporary moustache from his lip

You ought to see how still that little Georgie Bassett sits the
barber went on reprovingly I hear everybody says hes the best boy in
town

Pfuff PHIRR There was a touch of intentional contempt in this

I havent heard nobody around the neighbourhood makin no such
remarks added the barber about nobody of the name of Penrod
Schofield

Well said Penrod clearing his mouth after a struggle who wants em
to Ouch

I hear they call Georgie Bassett the little gentleman ventured the
barber provocatively meeting with instant success

They better not call ME that returned Penrod truculently Id like
to hear anybody try Just once thats all I bet theyd never try it
agOUCH

Why Whatd you do to em

Its all right what Id DO I bet they wouldnt want to call me that
again long as they lived

Whatd you do if it was a little girl You wouldnt hit her would
you

Well IdOuch

You wouldnt hit a little girl would you the barber persisted
gathering into his powerful fingers a mop of hair from the top of
Penrods head and pulling that suffering head into an unnatural
position Doesnt the Bible say it aint never right to hit the weak
sex

Ow SAY look OUT

So youd go and punch a pore weak little girl would you said the
barber reprovingly

Well who said Id hit her demanded the chivalrous Penrod I bet Id
FIX her though all right Shed see

You wouldnt call her names would you

No I wouldnt What hurt is it to call anybody names

Is that SO exclaimed the barber Then you was intending what I heard
you hollering at Fishers grocery delivery wagon driver fer a favour
the other day when I was goin by your house was you I reckon I better
tell him because he says to me afterWERDS if he ever lays eyes on you
when you aint in your own yard hes goin to do a whole lot o things
you aint goin to like Yessir thats what he says to ME

He better catch me first I guess before he talks so much

Well resumed the barber that aint sayin what youd do if a young
lady ever walked up and called you a little gentleman _I_ want to hear
what youd do to her I guess I know thoughcome to think of it

What demanded Penrod

Youd sick that pore ole dog of yours on her cat if she had one I
expect guessed the barber derisively

No I would not

Well what WOULD you do

Id do enough Dont worry about that

Well suppose it was a boy then whatd you do if a boy come up to you
and says Hello little gentleman

Hed be lucky said Penrod with a sinister frown if he got home
alive

Suppose it was a boy twice your size

Just let him try said Penrod ominously You just let him try Hed
never see daylight again thats all

The barber dug ten active fingers into the helpless scalp before him
and did his best to displace it while the anguished Penrod becoming
instantly a seething crucible of emotion misdirected his natural
resentment into maddened brooding upon what he would do to a boy twice
his size who should dare to call him little gentleman The barber
shook him as his father had never shaken him the barber buffeted him
rocked him frantically to and fro the barber seemed to be trying to
wring his neck and Penrod saw himself in staggering zigzag pictures
destroying large screaming fragmentary boys who had insulted him

The torture stopped suddenly and clenched weeping eyes began to see
again while the barber applied cooling lotions which made Penrod smell
like a coloured housemaids ideal

Now what asked the barber combing the reeking locks gently what
would it make you so mad fer to have somebody call you a little
gentleman Its a kind of compliment as it were you might say What
would you want to hit anybody fer THAT fer

To the mind of Penrod this question was without meaning or
reasonableness It was within neither his power nor his desire to
analyze the process by which the phrase had become offensive to him
and was now rapidly assuming the proportions of an outrage He knew only
that his gorge rose at the thought of it

You just let em try it he said threateningly as he slid down from
the chair And as he went out of the door after further conversation
on the same subject he called back those warning words once more Just
let em try it Just oncethats all _I_ ask em to Theyll find out
what they GET

The barber chuckled Then a fly lit on the barbers nose and he slapped
at it and the slap missed the fly but did not miss the nose The barber
was irritated At this moment his birdlike eye gleamed a gleam as it
fell upon customers approaching the prettiest little girl in the world
leading by the hand her baby brother MitchyMitch coming to have
MitchyMitchs hair clipped against the heat

It was a hot day and idle with little to feed the mindand the barber
was a mischievous man with an irritated nose He did his worst

Meanwhile the brooding Penrod pursued his homeward way no great
distance but long enough for several onesided conflicts with malign
insulters made of thin air You better NOT call me that he muttered
You just try it and youll get what other people got when THEY tried
it You better not ack fresh with ME Oh you WILL will you He
delivered a vicious kick full upon the shins of an iron fencepost
which suffered little though Penrod instantly regretted his
indiscretion Oof he grunted hopping and went on after bestowing a
look of awful hostility upon the fencepost I guess youll know better
next time he said in parting to this antagonist You just let me
catch you around here again and Ill His voice sank to inarticulate
but ominous murmurings He was in a dangerous mood

Nearing home however his belligerent spirit was diverted to happier
interests by the discovery that some workmen had left a caldron of tar
in the crossstreet close by his fathers stable He tested it but
found it inedible Also as a substitute for professional chewinggum
it was unsatisfactory being insufficiently boiled down and too thin
though of a pleasant lukewarm temperature But it had an excess of one
qualityit was sticky It was the stickiest tar Penrod had ever used
for any purposes whatsoever and nothing upon which he wiped his hands
served to rid them of it neither his polkadotted shirt waist nor his
knickerbockers neither the fence nor even Duke who came unthinkingly
wagging out to greet him and retired wiser

Nevertheless tar is tar Much can be done with it no matter what its
condition so Penrod lingered by the caldron though from a neighbouring
yard could be heard the voices of comrades including that of Sam
Williams On the ground about the caldron were scattered chips and
sticks and bits of wood to the number of a great multitude Penrod mixed
quantities of this refuse into the tar and interested himself in
seeing how much of it he could keep moving in slow swirls upon the ebon
surface

Other surprises were arranged for the absent workmen The caldron was
almost full and the surface of the tar near the rim

Penrod endeavoured to ascertain how many pebbles and brickbats dropped
in would cause an overflow Labouring heartily to this end he
had almost accomplished it when he received the suggestion for an
experiment on a much larger scale Embedded at the corner of a
grassplot across the street was a whitewashed stone the size of a small
watermelon and serving no purpose whatever save the questionable one of
decoration It was easily pried up with a stick though getting it to
the caldron tested the full strength of the ardent labourer Instructed
to perform such a task he would have sincerely maintained its
impossibility but now as it was unbidden and promised rather
destructive results he set about it with unconquerable energy feeling
certain that he would be rewarded with a mighty splash Perspiring
grunting vehemently his back aching and all muscles strained he
progressed in short stages until the big stone lay at the base of the
caldron He rested a moment panting then lifted the stone and was
bending his shoulders for the heave that would lift it over the rim
when a sweet taunting voice close behind him startled him cruelly

How do you do LITTLE GENTLEMAN

Penrod squawked dropped the stone and shouted Shut up you dern
fool purely from instinct even before his aboutface made him aware
who had so spitefully addressed him

It was Marjorie Jones Always dainty and prettily dressed she was in
speckless and starchy white today and a refreshing picture she made
with the newshorn and powerfully scented MitchyMitch clinging to
her hand They had stolen up behind the toiler and now stood laughing
together in sweet merriment Since the passing of Penrods Rupe Collins
period he had experienced some severe qualms at the recollection of his
last meeting with Marjorie and his Apache behaviour in truth his heart
instantly became as wax at sight of her and he would have offered
her fair speech but alas in Marjories wonderful eyes there shone
a consciousness of new powers for his undoing and she denied him
opportunity

Oh OH she cried mocking his pained outcry What a way for a LITTLE
GENTLEMAN to talk Little gentleman dont say wicked

Marjorie Penrod enraged and dismayed felt himself stung beyond all
endurance Insult from her was bitterer to endure than from any other
Dont you call me that again

Why not LITTLE GENTLEMAN

He stamped his foot You better stop

Marjorie sent into his furious face her lovely spiteful laughter

Little gentleman little gentleman little gentleman she said
deliberately Hows the little gentleman this afternoon Hello little
gentleman

Penrod quite beside himself danced eccentrically Dry up he howled
Dry up dry up dry up dry UP

MitchyMitch shouted with delight and applied a finger to the side
of the caldrona finger immediately snatched away and wiped upon a
handkerchief by his fastidious sister

Ittle gellamun said MitchyMitch

You better look out Penrod whirled upon this small offender with
grim satisfaction Here was at least something male that could without
dishonour be held responsible You say that again and Ill give you
the worst

You will NOT snapped Marjorie instantly vitriolic Hell say just
whatever he wants to and hell say it just as MUCH as he wants to Say
it again MitchyMitch

Ittle gellamun said MitchyMitch promptly

OwYAH Penrods toneproduction was becoming affected by his mental
condition You say that again and Ill

Go on MitchyMitch cried Marjorie He cant do a thing He dont
DARE Say it some more MitchyMitchsay it a whole lot

MitchyMitch his small fat face shining with confidence in his
immunity complied

Ittle gellamun he squeaked malevolently Ittle gellamun Ittle
gellamun Ittle gellamun

The desperate Penrod bent over the whitewashed rock lifted it and
thenoutdoing Porthos John Ridd and Ursus in one miraculous burst of
strengthheaved it into the air

Marjorie screamed

But it was too late The big stone descended into the precise midst of
the caldron and Penrod got his mighty splash It was far far beyond his
expectations

Spontaneously there were grand and awful effectsvolcanic spectacles of
nightmare and eruption A black sheet of eccentric shape rose out of the
caldron and descended upon the three children who had no time to evade
it

After it fell MitchyMitch who stood nearest the caldron was the
thickest though there was enough for all Brer Rabbit would have fled
from any of them



CHAPTER XXV TAR

When Marjorie and MitchyMitch got their breath they used it vocally
and seldom have more penetrating sounds issued from human throats
Coincidentally Marjorie quite baresark laid hands upon the largest
stick within reach and fell upon Penrod with blind fury He had the
presence of mind to flee and they went round and round the caldron
while MitchyMitch feebly endeavoured to followhis appearance in
this pursuit being pathetically like that of a bug fished out of an
inkwell alive but discouraged

Attracted by the riot Samuel Williams made his appearance vaulting a
fence and was immediately followed by Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett
They stared incredulously at the extraordinary spectacle before them

Little GENTILMUN shrieked Marjorie with a wild stroke that landed
full upon Penrods tarry cap

OOOCH bleated Penrod

Its Penrod shouted Sam Williams recognizing him by the voice For
an instant he had been in some doubt

Penrod Schofield exclaimed Georgie Bassett WHAT does this mean
That was Georgies style and had helped to win him his title

Marjorie leaned panting upon her stick I cucalleduh
himoh she sobbedI called him a lullittleohgentleman
And ohlullookoh lullook at my dudress Lullook at
MumitchyohMitchoh

Unexpectedly she smote againwith resultsand then seizing the
indistinguishable hand of MitchyMitch she ran wailing homeward down
the street

Little gentleman said Georgie Bassett with some evidences of
disturbed complacency Why thats what they call ME

Yes and you ARE one too shouted the maddened Penrod But you
better not let anybody call ME that Ive stood enough around here for
one day and you cant run over ME Georgie Bassett Just you put that
in your gizzard and smoke it

Anybody has a perfect right said Georgie with dignity to call a
person a little gentleman Theres lots of names nobody ought to call
but this ones a NICE

You better look out

Unavenged bruises were distributed all over Penrod both upon his body
and upon his spirit Driven by subtle forces he had dipped his hands in
catastrophe and disaster it was not for a Georgie Bassett to beard him
Penrod was about to run amuck

I havent called you a little gentleman yet said Georgie I only
said it Anybodys got a right to SAY it

Not around ME You just try it again and

I shall say it returned Georgie all I please Anybody in this town
has a right to SAY little gentleman

Bellowing insanely Penrod plunged his right hand into the caldron
rushed upon Georgie and made awful work of his hair and features

Alas it was but the beginning Sam Williams and Maurice Levy screamed
with delight and simultaneously infected danced about the struggling
pair shouting frantically

Little gentleman Little gentleman Sick him Georgie Sick him little
gentleman Little gentleman Little gentleman

The infuriated outlaw turned upon them with blows and more tar which
gave Georgie Bassett his opportunity and later seriously impaired the
purity of his fame Feeling himself hopelessly tarred he dipped both
hands repeatedly into the caldron and applied his gatherings to Penrod
It was bringing coals to Newcastle but it helped to assuage the just
wrath of Georgie

The four boys gave a fine imitation of the Laocoon group complicated
by an extra figure frantic splutterings and chokings strange cries and
stranger words issued from this tangle hands dipped lavishly into the
inexhaustible reservoir of tar with more and more picturesque results
The caldron had been elevated upon bricks and was not perfectly
balanced and under a heavy impact of the struggling group it lurched
and went partly over pouring forth a Stygian tide which formed a deep
pool in the gutter

It was the fate of Master Roderick Bitts that exclusive and immaculate
person to make his appearance upon the chaotic scene at this juncture
All in the cool of a white sailor suit he turned aside from the path
of dutywhich led straight to the house of a maiden auntand paused
to hop with joy upon the sidewalk A repeated epithet continuously half
panted half squawked somewhere in the nest of gladiators caught his
ear and he took it up excitedly not knowing why

Little gentleman shouted Roderick jumping up and down in childish
glee Little gentleman Little gentleman Lit

A frightful figure tore itself free from the group encircled this
innocent bystander with a black arm and hurled him headlong Full
length and flat on his face went Roderick into the Stygian pool The
frightful figure was Penrod

Instantly the pack flung themselves upon him again and carrying
them with him he went over upon Roderick who from that instant was as
active a belligerent as any there

Thus began the Great Tar Fight the origin of which proved afterward
so difficult for parents to trace owing to the opposing accounts of
the combatants Marjorie said Penrod began it Penrod said MitchyMitch
began it Sam Williams said Georgie Bassett began it Georgie and
Maurice Levy said Penrod began it Roderick Bitts who had not
recognized his first assailant said Sam Williams began it

Nobody thought of accusing the barber But the barber did not begin it
it was the fly on the barbers nose that began itthough of course
something else began the fly Somehow we never manage to hang the real
offender

The end came only with the arrival of Penrods mother who had been
having a painful conversation by telephone with Mrs Jones the mother
of Marjorie and came forth to seek an errant son It is a mystery how
she was able to pick out her own for by the time she got there his
voice was too hoarse to be recognizable Mr Schofields version of
things was that Penrod was insane Hes a stark raving lunatic
declared the father descending to the library from a beforedinner
interview with the outlaw that evening Id send him to military
school but I dont believe theyd take him Do you know WHY he says all
that awfulness happened

When Margaret and I were trying to scrub him responded Mrs Schofield
wearily he said everybody had been calling him names

Names snorted her husband Little gentleman THATS the vile
epithet they called him And because of it he wrecks the peace of six
homes

SH Yes he told us about it said Mrs Schofield moaning He told
us several hundred times I should guess though I didnt count Hes
got it fixed in his head and we couldnt get it out All we could do
was to put him in the closet Hed have gone out again after those boys
if we hadnt I dont know WHAT to make of him

Hes a mystery to ME said her husband And he refuses to explain
why he objects to being called little gentleman Says hed do the same
thingand worseif anybody dared to call him that again He said if
the President of the United States called him that hed try to whip him
How long did you have him locked up in the closet

SH said Mrs Schofield warningly About two hours but I dont think
it softened his spirit at all because when I took him to the barbers
to get his hair clipped again on account of the tar in it Sammy
Williams and Maurice Levy were there for the same reason and they just
WHISPERED little gentleman so low you could hardly hear themand
Penrod began fighting with them right before me and it was really all
the barber and I could do to drag him away from them The barber was
very kind about it but Penrod

I tell you hes a lunatic Mr Schofield would have said the same
thing of a Frenchman infuriated by the epithet camel The philosophy
of insult needs expounding

SH said Mrs Schofield It does seem a kind of frenzy

Why on earth should any sane person mind being called

SH said Mrs Schofield Its beyond ME

What are you SHing me for demanded Mr Schofield explosively

SH said Mrs Schofield Its Mr Kinosling the new rector of Saint
Josephs

Where

SH On the front porch with Margaret hes going to stay for dinner I
do hope

Bachelor isnt he

Yes

OUR old minister was speaking of him the other day said Mr
Schofield and he didnt seem so terribly impressed

SH Yes about thirty and of course so superior to most of Margarets
friendsboys home from college She thinks she likes young Robert
Williams I knowbut he laughs so much Of course there isnt any
comparison Mr Kinosling talks so intellectually its a good thing for
Margaret to hear that kind of thing for a change and of course hes
very spiritual He seems very much interested in her She paused to
muse I think Margaret likes him hes so different too Its the
third time hes dropped in this week and I

Well said Mr Schofield grimly if you and Margaret want him to come
again youd better not let him see Penrod

But hes asked to see him he seems interested in meeting all the
family And Penrod nearly always behaves fairly well at table
She paused and then put to her husband a question referring to his
interview with Penrod upstairs Did youdid youdo it

No he answered gloomily No I didnt but He was interrupted
by a violent crash of china and metal in the kitchen a shriek from
Della and the outrageous voice of Penrod The wellinformed Della
illinspired to set up for a wit had ventured to address the scion of
the house roguishly as little gentleman and Penrod by means of the
rapid elevation of his right foot had removed from her supporting
hands a laden tray Both parents started for the kitchen Mr Schofield
completing his interrupted sentence on the way

But I will now

The rite thus promised was hastily but accurately performed in that
apartment most distant from the front porch and twenty minutes later
Penrod descended to dinner The Rev Mr Kinosling had asked for the
pleasure of meeting him and it had been decided that the only course
possible was to cover up the scandal for the present and to offer an
undisturbed and smiling family surface to the gaze of the visitor

Scorched but not bowed the smouldering Penrod was led forward for the
social formulae simultaneously with the somewhat bleak departure of
Robert Williams who took his guitar with him this time and went in
forlorn unconsciousness of the powerful forces already set in secret
motion to be his allies

The punishment just undergone had but made the haughty and unyielding
soul of Penrod more stalwart in revolt he was unconquered Every time
the one intolerable insult had been offered him his resentment had
become the hotter his vengeance the more instant and furious And
still burning with outrage but upheld by the conviction of right he
was determined to continue to the last drop of his blood the defense
of his honour whenever it should be assailed no matter how mighty or
august the powers that attacked it In all ways he was a very sore boy

During the brief ceremony of presentation his usually inscrutable
countenance wore an expression interpreted by his father as one of
insane obstinacy while Mrs Schofield found it an incentive to inward
prayer The fine graciousness of Mr Kinosling however was unimpaired
by the glare of virulent suspicion given him by this little brother Mr
Kinosling mistook it for a natural curiosity concerning one who might
possibly become in time a member of the family He patted Penrod upon
the head which was for many reasons in no condition to be patted with
any pleasure to the patter Penrod felt himself in the presence of a new
enemy

How do you do my little lad said Mr Kinosling I trust we shall
become fast friends

To the ear of his little lad it seemed he said A trost we shall
bickhome fawst frainds Mr Kinoslings pronunciation was in fact
slightly precious and the little lad simply mistaking it for some
cryptic form of mockery of himself assumed a manner and expression
which argued so ill for the proposed friendship that Mrs Schofield
hastily interposed the suggestion of dinner and the small procession
went in to the diningroom

It has been a delicious day said Mr Kinosling presently warm but
balmy With a benevolent smile he addressed Penrod who sat opposite
him I suppose little gentleman you have been indulging in the usual
outdoor sports of vacation

Penrod laid down his fork and glared openmouthed at Mr Kinosling

Youll have another slice of breast of the chicken Mr Schofield
inquired loudly and quickly

A lovely day exclaimed Margaret with equal promptitude and emphasis
Lovely oh lovely Lovely

Beautiful beautiful beautiful said Mrs Schofield and after a
glance at Penrod which confirmed her impression that he intended to
say something she continued Yes beautiful beautiful beautiful
beautiful beautiful beautiful

Penrod closed his mouth and sank back in his chairand his relatives
took breath

Mr Kinosling looked pleased This responsive family with its ready
enthusiasm made the kind of audience he liked He passed a delicate
white hand gracefully over his tall pale forehead and smiled
indulgently

Youth relaxes in summer he said Boyhood is the age of relaxation
one is playful light free unfettered One runs and leaps and enjoys
ones self with ones companions It is good for the little lads to play
with their friends they jostle push and wrestle and simulate little
happy struggles with one another in harmless conflict The young muscles
are toughening It is good Boyish chivalry develops enlarges expands
The young learn quickly intuitively spontaneously They perceive the
obligations of noblesse oblige They begin to comprehend the necessity
of caste and its requirements They learn what birth meansahthat
is they learn what it means to be well born They learn courtesy in
their games they learn politeness consideration for one another in
their pastimes amusements lighter occupations I make it my pleasure
to join them often for I sympathize with them in all their wholesome
joys as well as in their little bothers and perplexities I understand
them you see and let me tell you it is no easy matter to understand
the little lads and lassies He sent to each listener his beaming
glance and permitting it to come to rest upon Penrod inquired

And what do you say to that little gentleman

Mr Schofield uttered a stentorian cough More Youd better have some
more chicken More Do

More chicken urged Margaret simultaneously Do please Please More
Do More

Beautiful beautiful began Mrs Schofield Beautiful beautiful
beautiful beautiful

It is not known in what light Mr Kinosling viewed the expression of
Penrods face Perhaps he mistook it for awe perhaps he received
no impression at all of its extraordinary quality He was a rather
selfengrossed young man just then engaged in a double occupation for
he not only talked but supplied from his own consciousness a critical
though favourable auditor as well which of course kept him quite busy
Besides it is oftener than is expected the case that extremely peculiar
expressions upon the countenances of boys are entirely overlooked
and suggest nothing to the minds of people staring straight at them
Certainly Penrods expressionwhich to the perception of his family
was perfectly horriblecaused not the faintest perturbation in the
breast of Mr Kinosling

Mr Kinosling waived the chicken and continued to talk Yes I think
I may claim to understand boys he said smiling thoughtfully One
has been a boy ones self Ah it is not all playtime I hope our young
scholar here does not overwork himself at his Latin at his classics
as I did so that at the age of eight years I was compelled to wear
glasses He must be careful not to strain the little eyes at his
scholars tasks not to let the little shoulders grow round over his
scholars desk Youth is golden we should keep it golden bright
glistening Youth should frolic should be sprightly it should play its
cricket its tennis its handball It should run and leap it should
laugh should sing madrigals and glees carol with the lark ring out in
chanties folksongs ballads roundelays

He talked on At any instant Mr Schofield held himself ready to cough
vehemently and shout More chicken to drown out Penrod in case the
fatal words again fell from those eloquent lips and Mrs Schofield and
Margaret kept themselves prepared at all times to assist him So passed
a threatening meal which Mrs Schofield hurried by every means with
decency to its conclusion She felt that somehow they would all be
safer out in the dark of the front porch and led the way thither as
soon as possible

No cigar I thank you Mr Kinosling establishing himself in a wicker
chair beside Margaret waved away her fathers proffer I do not smoke
I have never tasted tobacco in any form Mrs Schofield was confirmed
in her opinion that this would be an ideal soninlaw Mr Schofield was
not so sure

No said Mr Kinosling No tobacco for me No cigar no pipe no
cigarette no cheroot For me a booka volume of poems perhaps
Verses rhymes lines metrical and cadencedthose are my dissipation
Tennyson by preference Maud or Idylls of the Kingpoetry of the
sound Victorian days there is none later Or Longfellow will rest me
in a tired hour Yes for me a book a volume in the hand held lightly
between the fingers

Mr Kinosling looked pleasantly at his fingers as he spoke waving his
hand in a curving gesture which brought it into the light of a window
faintly illumined from the interior of the house Then he passed those
graceful fingers over his hair and turned toward Penrod who was
perched upon the railing in a dark corner

The evening is touched with a slight coolness said Mr Kinosling
Perhaps I may request the little gentleman

BgrrRUFF coughed Mr Schofield Youd better change your mind
about a cigar

No I thank you I was about to request the lit

DO try one Margaret urged Im sure papas are nice ones Do
try

No I thank you I remarked a slight coolness in the air and my hat is
in the hallway I was about to request

Ill get it for you said Penrod suddenly

If you will be so good said Mr Kinosling It is a black bowler hat
little gentleman and placed upon a table in the hall

I know where it is Penrod entered the door and a feeling of relief
mutually experienced carried from one to another of his three relatives
their interchanged congratulations that he had recovered his sanity

The day is done and the darkness began Mr Kinoslingand recited
that poem entire He followed it with The Childrens Hour and after a
pause at the close to allow his listeners time for a little reflection
upon his rendition he passed his handagain over his head and called
in the direction of the doorway

I believe I will take my hat now little gentleman

Here it is said Penrod unexpectedly climbing over the porch railing
in the other direction His mother and father and Margaret had supposed
him to be standing in the hallway out of deference and because he
thought it tactful not to interrupt the recitations All of them
remembered later that this supposed thoughtfulness on his part struck
them as unnatural

Very good little gentleman said Mr Kinosling and being somewhat
chilled placed the hat firmly upon his head pulling it down as far
as it would go It had a pleasant warmth which he noticed at once The
next instant he noticed something else a peculiar sensation of the
scalpa sensation which he was quite unable to define He lifted his
hand to take the hat off and entered upon a strange experience his hat
seemed to have decided to remain where it was

Do you like Tennyson as much as Longfellow Mr Kinosling inquired
Margaret

IahI cannot say he returned absently Iaheach has his
ownugh flavour and savour each hisahah

Struck by a strangeness in his tone she peered at him curiously through
the dusk His outlines were indistinct but she made out that his arms
were uplifted in a singular gesture He seemed to be wrenching at his
head

Isis anything the matter she asked anxiously Mr Kinosling are
you ill

Not atughall he replied in the same odd tone IahI
believeUGH

He dropped his hands from his hat and rose His manner was
slightly agitated I fear I may have taken a triflingahcold
I shouldahperhaps beahbetter at home I willahsay
goodnight

At the steps he instinctively lifted his hand to remove his hat
but did not do so and saying Goodnight again in a frigid voice
departed with visible stiffness from that house to return no more

Well of all cried Mrs Schofield astounded What was the
matter He just wentlike that She made a flurried gesture In
heavens name Margaret what DID you say to him

_I_ exclaimed Margaret indignantly Nothing He just WENT

Why he didnt even take off his hat when he said goodnight said
Mrs Schofield

Margaret who had crossed to the doorway caught the ghost of a whisper
behind her where stood Penrod

YOU BET HE DIDNT

He knew not that he was overheard

A frightful suspicion flashed through Margarets minda suspicion that
Mr Kinoslings hat would have to be either boiled off or shaved off
With growing horror she recalled Penrods long absence when he went to
bring the hat

Penrod she cried let me see your hands

She had toiled at those hands herself late that afternoon nearly
scalding her own but at last achieving a lily purity

Let me see your hands

She seized them

Again they were tarred



CHAPTER XXVI THE QUIET AFTERNOON

Perhaps middleaged people might discern Natures real intentions in the
matter of pain if they would examine a boys punishments and sorrows
for he prolongs neither beyond their actual duration With a boy
trouble must be of Homeric dimensions to last overnight To him every
next day is really a new day Thus Penrod woke next morning with
neither the unspared rod nor Mr Kinosling in his mind Tar itself
so far as his consideration of it went might have been an undiscovered
substance His mood was cheerful and mercantile some process having
worked mysteriously within him during the night to the result that
his first waking thought was of profits connected with the sale of old
ironor perhaps a ragman had passed the house just before he woke

By ten oclock he had formed a partnership with the indeed amiable Sam
and the firm of Schofield and Williams plunged headlong into commerce
Heavy dealings in rags paper old iron and lead gave the firm a balance
of twentytwo cents on the evening of the third day but a venture in
glassware following proved disappointing on account of the scepticism
of all the druggists in that part of town even after seven laborious
hours had been spent in cleansing a wheelbarrowload of old medicine
bottles with hydrant water and ashes Likewise the partners were
disheartened by their failure to dispose of a crop of greens although
they had uprooted specimens of that decorative and unappreciated flower
the dandelion with such persistence and energy that the Schofields and
Williams lawns looked curiously haggard for the rest of that summer

The fit passed business languished became extinct The dogdays had
set in

One August afternoon was so hot that even boys sought indoor shade In
the dimness of the vacant carriagehouse of the stable lounged Masters
Penrod Schofield Samuel Williams Maurice Levy Georgie Bassett and
Herman They sat still and talked It is a hot day in rare truth when
boys devote themselves principally to conversation and this day was
that hot

Their elders should beware such days Peril hovers near when the
fierceness of weather forces inaction and boys in groups are quiet
The more closely volcanoes Western rivers nitroglycerin and boys
are pent the deadlier is their action at the point of outbreak Thus
parents and guardians should look for outrages of the most singular
violence and of the most peculiar nature during the confining weather of
February and August

The thing which befell upon this broiling afternoon began to brew and
stew peacefully enough All was innocence and languor no one could have
foretold the eruption

They were upon their great theme When I get to be a man Being human
though boys they considered their present estate too commonplace to be
dwelt upon So when the old men gather they say When I was a boy
It really is the land of nowadays that we never discover

When Im a man said Sam Williams Im goin to hire me a couple of
coloured waiters to swing me in a hammock and keep pourin icewater on
me all day out o those waterincans they sprinkle flowers from Ill
hire you for one of em Herman

No you ain goin to said Herman promptly You ain no flowuh
But nev min nat anyway Ain nobody goin haih me whens _I_m a man
Goin be my own boss _I_m go be a rairoad man

You mean like a superintendent or sumpthing like that and sell
tickets asked Penrod

Supinnev min nat Sell ticket NO suh Go be a POtuh My uncle a
potuh right now Solid gole buttonsoh oh

Generals get a lot more buttons than porters said Penrod
Generals

Potuhs make the bes lvin Herman interrupted My uncle spen mo
money n any white man nis town

Well I rather be a general said Penrod or a senator or sumpthing
like that

Senators live in Warshington Maurice Levy contributed the
information I been there Warshington aint so much Niagra Falls is
a hundred times as good as Warshington Sos Tlantic City I was there
too I been everywhere there is I

Well anyway said Sam Williams raising his voice in order to obtain
the floor anyway Im goin to lay in a hammock all day and have
icewater sprinkled on top o me and Im goin to lay there all night
too and the next day Im goin to lay there a couple o years maybe

I bet you dont exclaimed Maurice Whatd you do in winter

What

What you goin to do when its winter out in a hammock with water
sprinkled on top o you all day I bet you

Id stay right there Sam declared with strong conviction blinking
as he looked out through the open doors at the dazzling lawn and trees
trembling in the heat They couldnt sprinkle too much for ME

Itd make icicles all over you and

I wish it would said Sam Id eat em up

And itd snow on you

Yay Id swaller it as fast as itd come down I wish I had a BARREL
o snow right now I wish this whole barn was full of it I wish they
wasnt anything in the whole world except just good ole snow

Penrod and Herman rose and went out to the hydrant where they drank
long and ardently Sam was still talking about snow when they returned

No I wouldnt just roll in it Id stick it all round inside my
cloes and fill my hat No Id freeze a big pile of it all hard and
Id roll her out flat and then Id carry her down to some ole tailors
and have him make me a SUIT out of her and

Cant you keep still about your ole snow demanded Penrod petulantly
Makes me so thirsty I cant keep still and Ive drunk so much now I
bet I bust That ole hydrant waters mighty near hot anyway

Im goin to have a big store when I grow up volunteered Maurice

Candy store asked Penrod

NO sir Ill have candy in it but not to eat so much Its goin to
be a deportment store ladies clothes gentlemens clothes neckties
china goods leather goods nice lines in woollings and lace goods

Yay I wouldnt give a fiveforacent marble for your whole store
said Sam Would you Penrod

Not for ten of em not for a million of em _I_m goin to have

Wait clamoured Maurice Youd be foolish because theyd be a toy
deportment in my store where theyd be a hunderd marbles So how much
would you think your fiveforacent marble counts for And when Im
keepin my store Im goin to get married

Yay shrieked Sam derisively MARRIED Listen Penrod and Herman
joined in the howl of contempt

Certumly Ill get married asserted Maurice stoutly Ill get married
to Marjorie Jones She likes me awful good and Im her beau

What makes you think so inquired Penrod in a cryptic voice

Because shes my beau too came the prompt answer Im her beau
because shes my beau I guess thats plenty reason Ill get married to
her as soon as I get my store running nice

Penrod looked upon him darkly but for the moment held his peace

Married jeered Sam Williams Married to Marjorie Jones Youre the
only boy I ever heard say he was going to get married I wouldnt
get married forwhy I wouldnt forfor Unable to think of
any inducement the mere mention of which would not be ridiculously
incommensurate he proceeded I wouldnt do it What you want to get
married for What do married people do except just come home tired and
worry around and kind of scold You better not do it Mrice youll be
mighty sorry

Everybody gets married stated Maurice holding his ground

They gotta

Ill bet _I_ dont Sam returned hotly They better catch me before
they tell ME I have to Anyway I bet nobody has to get married unless
they want to

They do too insisted Maurice They GOTTA

Who told you

Look at what my own papa told me cried Maurice heated with argument
Didnt he tell me your papa had to marry your mamma or else he
neverd got to handle a cent of her money Certumly people gotta marry
Everybody You dont know anybody over twenty years old that isnt
marriedexcept maybe teachers

Look at policemen shouted Sam triumphantly You dont spose anybody
can make policemen get married I reckon do you

Well policemen maybe Maurice was forced to admit Policemen and
teachers dont but everybody else gotta

Well Ill be a policeman said Sam THEN I guess they wont come
around tellin me I have to get married What you goin to be Penrod

Chief police said the laconic Penrod

What you Sam inquired of quiet Georgie Bassett

I am going to be said Georgie consciously a minister

This announcement created a sensation so profound that it was followed
by silence Herman was the first to speak

You mean preachuh he asked incredulously You go PREACH

Yes answered Georgie looking like Saint Cecilia at the organ

Herman was impressed You know all at preachuh talk

Im going to learn it said Georgie simply

How loud kin you holler asked Herman doubtfully

He cant holler at all Penrod interposed with scorn He hollers like
a girl Hes the poorest hollerer in town

Herman shook his head Evidently he thought Georgies chance of being
ordained very slender Nevertheless a final question put to the
candidate by the coloured expert seemed to admit one ray of hope

How good kin you clim a pole

He cant climb one at all Penrod answered for Georgie Over at Sams
turningpole you ought to see him try to

Preachers dont have to climb poles Georgie said with dignity

GOOD ones do declared Herman Bes one ev _I_ hear he clim up an
down same as a circus man One nem big vivals outen whens we livin on
a fahm preachuh clim big pole right in a middle o the church what
was to hol roof up He clim way high up an holler Goin to heavum
goin to heavum goin to heavum NOW Hallelujah praise my Lawd An
he slide down little an holler Devils got a hol o my coattails
devil tryin to drag me down Sinnuhs take wawnun Devil got a hol o
my coattails Im agoin to hell oh Lawd Nex he clim up little
mo an yell an holler Done shuck ole devil loose goin straight to

Lawd Las he slide all away down jes asquallin an akickin an
ararin up an squealin Goin to hell Goin to hell Ole Satum got
my soul Goin to hell Goin to hell Goin to hell hell hell

Herman possessed that extraordinary facility for vivid acting which is
the great native gift of his race and he enchained his listeners They
sat fascinated and spellbound

Herman tell that again said Penrod breathlessly

Herman nothing loath accepted the encore and repeated the Miltonic
episode expanding it somewhat and dwelling with a fine art upon those
portions of the narrative which he perceived to be most exciting to his
audience Plainly they thrilled less to Paradise gained than to its
losing and the dreadful climax of the descent into the Pit was the
greatest treat of all

The effect was immense and instant Penrod sprang to his feet

Georgie Bassett couldnt do that to save his life he declared _I_m
goin to be a preacher ID be all right for one wouldnt I Herman

So am I Sam Williams echoed loudly I guess I can do it if YOU can
Id be bettern Penrod wouldnt I Herman

I am too Maurice shouted I got a stronger voice than anybody here
and Id like to know what

The three clamoured together indistinguishably each asserting his
qualifications for the ministry according to Hermans theory which had
been accepted by these sudden converts without question

Listen to ME Maurice bellowed proving his claim to at least the
voice by drowning the others Maybe I cant climb a pole so good but
who can holler loudern this Listen to MEEE

Shut up cried Penrod irritated Go to heaven go to hell

Ooooh exclaimed Georgie Bassett profoundly shocked

Sam and Maurice awed by Penrods daring ceased from turmoil staring
wideeyed

You cursed and swore said Georgie

I did not cried Penrod hotly That isnt swearing

You said Go to a big H said Georgie

I did not I said Go to heaven before I said a big H That isnt
swearing is it Herman Its almost what the preacher said aint it
Herman It aint swearing now any morenot if you put go to heaven
with it is it Herman You can say it all you want to long as you
say go to heaven first CANT you Herman Anybody can say it if
the preacher says it cant they Herman I guess I know when I aint
swearing dont I Herman

Judge Herman ruled for the defendant and Penrod was considered to have
carried his point With fine consistency the conclave established
that it was proper for the general public to say it provided go to
heaven should in all cases precede it This prefix was pronounced a
perfect disinfectant removing all odour of impiety or insult and with
the exception of Georgie Bassett who maintained that the ministers
words were going and gone not go all the boys proceeded to
exercise their new privilege so lavishly that they tired of it

But there was no diminution of evangelical ardour again were heard the
clamours of dispute as to which was the best qualified for the ministry
each of the claimants appealing passionately to Herman who pleased but
confused appeared to be incapable of arriving at a decision

During a pause Georgie Bassett asserted his prior rights Who said
it first Id like to know he demanded I was going to be a minister
from long back of today I guess And I guess I said I was going to be
a minister right today before any of you said anything at all DIDNT
I Herman YOU heard me didnt you Herman Thats the very thing
started you talking about it wasnt it Herman

You right said Herman You the firs one to say it

Penrod Sam and Maurice immediately lost faith in Herman

What if you did say it first Penrod shouted You couldnt BE a
minister if you were a hunderd years old

I bet his mother wouldnt let him be one said Sam She never lets
him do anything

She would too retorted Georgie Ever since I was little she

Hes too sissy to be a preacher cried Maurice Listen at his squeaky
voice

Im going to be a better minister shouted Georgie than all three of
you put together I could do it with my left hand

The three laughed bitingly in chorus They jeered derided scoffed
and raised an uproar which would have had its effect upon much stronger
nerves than Georgies For a time he contained his rising choler and
chanted monotonously over and over I COULD I COULD TOO I COULD
I COULD TOO But their tumult wore upon him and he decided to avail
himself of the recent decision whereby a big H was rendered innocuous
and unprofane Having used the expression once he found it comforting
and substituted it for I could I could too

But it relieved him only temporarily His tormentors were unaffected
by it and increased their howlings until at last Georgie lost his head
altogether Badgered beyond bearing his eyes shining with a wild light
he broke through the besieging trio hurling little Maurice from his
path with a frantic hand

Ill show you he cried in this sudden frenzy You give me a chance
and Ill prove it right NOW

Thats talkin business shouted Penrod Everybody keep still a
minute Everybody

He took command of the situation at once displaying a fine capacity for
organization and system It needed only a few minutes to set order in
the place of confusion and to determine with the full concurrence of
all parties the conditions under which Georgie Bassett was to defend
his claim by undergoing what may be perhaps intelligibly defined as the
Herman test Georgie declared he could do it easily He was in a state
of great excitement and in no condition to think calmly or probably he
would not have made the attempt at all Certainly he was overconfident



CHAPTER XXVII CONCLUSION OF THE QUIET AFTERNOON

It was during the discussion of the details of this enterprise that
Georgies mother a short distance down the street received a few
female callers who came by appointment to drink a glass of iced tea
with her and to meet the Rev Mr Kinosling Mr Kinosling was proving
almost formidably interesting to the women and girls of his own
and other flocks What favour of his fellow clergymen a slight
precociousness of manner and pronunciation cost him was more than
balanced by the visible ecstasies of ladies They blossomed at his
touch

He had just entered Mrs Bassetts front door when the son of the
house followed by an intent and earnest company of four opened the
alley gate and came into the yard The unconscious Mrs Bassett was
about to have her first experience of a fatal coincidence It was her
first because she was the mother of a boy so well behaved that he had
become a proverb of transcendency Fatal coincidences were plentiful
in the Schofield and Williams families and would have been familiar to
Mrs Bassett had Georgie been permitted greater intimacy with Penrod and
Sam

Mr Kinosling sipped his iced tea and looked about him approvingly
Seven ladies leaned forward for it was to be seen that he meant to
speak

This cool room is a relief he said waving a graceful hand in
a neatly limited gesture which everybodys eyes followed his own
included It is a relief and a retreat The windows open the blinds
closedthat is as it should be It is a retreat a fastness a bastion
against the heats assault For me a quiet rooma quiet room and a
book a volume in the hand held lightly between the fingers A volume
of poems lines metrical and cadenced something by a sound Victorian
We have no later poets

Swinburne suggested Miss Beam an eager spinster Swinburne Mr
Kinosling Ah SWINBURNE

Not Swinburne said Mr Kinosling chastely No

That concluded all the remarks about Swinburne


Miss Beam retired in confusion behind another lady and somehow there
became diffused an impression that Miss Beam was erotic

I do not observe your manly little son Mr Kinosling addressed his
hostess

Hes out playing in the yard Mrs Bassett returned I heard his
voice just now I think

Everywhere I hear wonderful report of him said Mr Kinosling I
may say that I understand boys and I feel that he is a rare a fine a
pure a lofty spirit I say spirit for spirit is the word I hear spoken
of him

A chorus of enthusiastic approbation affirmed the accuracy of this
proclamation and Mrs Bassett flushed with pleasure Georgies
spiritual perfection was demonstrated by instances of it related by
the visitors his piety was cited and wonderful things he had said were
quoted

Not all boys are pure of fine spirit of high mind said Mr
Kinosling and continued with true feeling You have a neighbour dear
Mrs Bassett whose household I indeed really feel it quite impossible
to visit until such time when better firmer stronger handed more
determined discipline shall prevail I find Mr and Mrs Schofield and
their daughter charming

Three or four ladies said Oh and spoke a name simultaneously It was
as if they had said Oh the bubonic plague

Oh Penrod Schofield

Georgie does not play with him said Mrs Bassett quicklythat
is he avoids him as much as he can without hurting Penrods feelings
Georgie is very sensitive to giving pain I suppose a mother should not
tell these things and I know people who talk about their own children
are dreadful bores but it was only last Thursday night that Georgie
looked up in my face so sweetly after he had said his prayers and his
little cheeks flushed as he said Mamma I think it would be right for
me to go more with Penrod I think it would make him a better boy

A sibilance went about the room Sweet How sweet The sweet little
soul Ah SWEET

And that very afternoon continued Mrs Bassett he had come home in
a dreadful state Penrod had thrown tar all over him

Your son has a forgiving spirit said Mr Kinosling with vehemence A
too forgiving spirit perhaps He set down his glass No more I thank
you No more cake I thank you Was it not Cardinal Newman who said

He was interrupted by the sounds of an altercation just outside the
closed blinds of the window nearest him

Let him pick his tree It was the voice of Samuel Williams Didnt we
come over here to give him one of his own trees Give him a fair show
cant you

The little lads Mr Kinosling smiled They have their games their
outdoor sports their pastimes The young muscles are toughening The
sun will not harm them They grow they expand they learn They learn
fair play honour courtesy from one another as pebbles grow round
in the brook They learn more from themselves than from us They take
shape form outline Let them

Mr Kinosling Another spinsterundeterred by what had happened
to Miss Beamleaned fair forward her face shining and ardent Mr
Kinosling theres a question I DO wish to ask you

My dear Miss Cosslit Mr Kinosling responded again waving his hand
and watching it I am entirely at your disposal

WAS Joan of Arc she asked fervently inspired by spirits

He smiled indulgently Yesand no he said One must give both
answers One must give the answer yes one must give the answer no

Oh THANK you said Miss Cosslit blushing

Shes one of my great enthusiasms you know

And I have a question too urged Mrs Lora Rewbush after a moments
hasty concentration Ive never been able to settle it for myself but
NOW

Yes said Mr Kinosling encouragingly

Isahisoh yes Is Sanskrit a more difficult language than
Spanish Mr Kinosling

It depends upon the student replied the oracle smiling One must not
look for linguists everywhere In my own especial caseif one may cite
ones self as an exampleI found no great no insurmountable difficulty
in mastering in conquering either

And may _I_ ask one ventured Mrs Bassett Do you think it is right
to wear egrets

There are marks of quality of caste of social distinction Mr
Kinosling began which must be permitted allowed though perhaps
regulated Social distinction one observes almost invariably
implies spiritual distinction as well Distinction of circumstances
is accompanied by mental distinction Distinction is hereditary it
descends from father to son and if there is one thing more true
than Like father like son it is he bowed gallantly to Mrs
Bassettit is Like mother like son What these good ladies have
said this afternoon of YOUR

This was the fatal instant There smote upon all ears the voice of
Georgie painfully shrill and penetratingfraught with protest and
protracted strain His plain words consisted of the newly sanctioned
and disinfected curse with a big H

With an ejaculation of horror Mrs Bassett sprang to the window and
threw open the blinds

Georgies back was disclosed to the view of the teaparty He was
endeavouring to ascend a maple tree about twelve feet from the window
Embracing the trunk with arms and legs he had managed to squirm to a
point above the heads of Penrod and Herman who stood close by watching
him earnestlyPenrod being obviously in charge of the performance
Across the yard were Sam Williams and Maurice Levy acting as a jury on
the question of voicepower and it was to a complaint of theirs that
Georgie had just replied

Thats right Georgie said Penrod encouragingly They can too hear
you Let her go

Going to heaven shrieked Georgie squirming up another inch Going
to heaven heaven heaven

His mothers frenzied attempts to attract his attention failed utterly
Georgie was using the full power of his lungs deafening his own ears to
all other sounds Mrs Bassett called in vain while the teaparty stood
petrified in a cluster about the window

Going to heaven Georgie bellowed Going to heaven Going to heaven
my Lord Going to heaven heaven heaven

He tried to climb higher but began to slip downward his exertions
causing damage to his apparel A button flew into the air and his
knickerbockers and his waistband severed relations

Devils got my coattails sinners Old devils got my coattails he
announced appropriately Then he began to slide

He relaxed his clasp of the tree and slid to the ground

Going to hell shrieked Georgie reaching a high pitch of enthusiasm
in this great climax Going to hell Going to hell Im gone to hell
hell hell

With a loud scream Mrs Bassett threw herself out of the window
alighting by some miracle upon her feet with ankles unsprained

Mr Kinosling feeling that his presence as spiritual adviser was
demanded in the yard followed with greater dignity through the front
door At the corner of the house a small departing figure collided with
him violently It was Penrod tactfully withdrawing from what promised
to be a family scene of unusual painfulness

Mr Kinosling seized him by the shoulders and giving way to emotion
shook him viciously

You horrible boy exclaimed Mr Kinosling You ruffianly creature Do
you know whats going to happen to you when you grow up Do you realize
what youre going to BE

With flashing eyes the indignant boy made know his unshaken purpose He
shouted the reply

A minister



CHAPTER XXVIII TWELVE

This busy globe which spawns us is as incapable of flattery and as
intent upon its own affair whatever that is as a gyroscope it keeps
steadily whirling along its lawful track and thus far seeming to hold
a right of way spins doggedly on with no perceptible diminution of
speed to mark the most gigantic human eventsit did not pause to pant
and recuperate even when what seemed to Penrod its principal purpose
was accomplished and an enormous shadow vanishing westward over its
surface marked the dawn of his twelfth birthday

To be twelve is an attainment worth the struggle A boy just twelve is
like a Frenchman just elected to the Academy

Distinction and honour wait upon him Younger boys show deference to a
person of twelve his experience is guaranteed his judgment therefore
mellow consequently his influence is profound Eleven is not quite
satisfactory it is only an approach Eleven has the disadvantage of
six of nineteen of fortyfour and of sixtynine But like twelve
seven is an honourable age and the ambition to attain it is laudable
People look forward to being seven Similarly twenty is worthy and so
arbitrarily is twentyone fortyfive has great solidity seventy is
most commendable and each year thereafter an increasing honour Thirteen
is embarrassed by the beginnings of a new colthood the child becomes a
youth But twelve is the very top of boyhood

Dressing that morning Penrod felt that the world was changed from the
world of yesterday For one thing he seemed to own more of it this
day was HIS day And it was a day worth owning the midsummer sunshine
pouring gold through his window came from a cool sky and a breeze
moved pleasantly in his hair as he leaned from the sill to watch the
tribe of clattering blackbirds take wing following their leader
from the trees in the yard to the days work in the open country The
blackbirds were his as the sunshine and the breeze were his for they
all belonged to the day which was his birthday and therefore most surely
his Pride suffused him he was twelve

His father and his mother and Margaret seemed to understand the
difference between today and yesterday They were at the table when
he descended and they gave him a greeting which of itself marked the
milestone Habitually his entrance into a room where his elders sat
brought a cloud of apprehension they were prone to look up in pathetic
expectancy as if their thought was What new awfulness is he going to
start NOW But this morning they laughed his mother rose and kissed
him twelve times so did Margaret and his father shouted Well well
Hows the MAN

Then his mother gave him a Bible and The Vicar of Wakefield Margaret
gave him a pair of silvermounted hair brushes and his father gave him
a Pocket Atlas and a small compass

And now Penrod said his mother after breakfast Im going to
take you out in the country to pay your birthday respects to Aunt Sarah
Crim

Aunt Sarah Crim Penrods greataunt was his oldest living relative
She was ninety and when Mrs Schofield and Penrod alighted from a
carriage at her gate they found her digging with a spade in the garden

Im glad you brought him she said desisting from labour Jinnys
baking a cake Im going to send for his birthday party Bring him in the
house Ive got something for him

She led the way to her sittingroom which had a pleasant smell
unlike any other smell and opening the drawer of a shining old
whatnot took therefrom a boys slingshot made of a forked stick
two strips of rubber and a bit of leather

This isnt for you she said placing it in Penrods eager hand
No It would break all to pieces the first time you tried to shoot
it because it is thirtyfive years old I want to send it back to your
father I think its time You give it to him from me and tell him
I say I believe I can trust him with it now I took it away from him
thirtyfive years ago one day after hed killed my best hen with
it accidentally and broken a glass pitcher on the back porch with
itaccidentally He doesnt look like a person whos ever done things
of that sort and I suppose hes forgotten it so well that he believes
he never DID but if you give it to him from me I think hell remember
You look like him Penrod He was anything but a handsome boy

After this final bit of reminiscenceprobably designed to be repeated
to Mr Schofieldshe disappeared in the direction of the kitchen
and returned with a pitcher of lemonade and a blue china dish sweetly
freighted with flat ginger cookies of a composition that was her own
secret Then having set this collation before her guests she presented
Penrod with a superb intricate and very modern machine of destructive
capacities almost limitless She called it a pocketknife

I suppose youll do something horrible with it she said composedly
I hear you do that with everything anyhow so you might as well do it
with this and have more fun out of it They tell me youre the Worst
Boy in Town

Oh Aunt Sarah Mrs Schofield lifted a protesting hand

Nonsense said Mrs Crim

But on his birthday

Thats the time to say it Penrod arent you the Worst Boy in Town

Penrod gazing fondly upon his knife and eating cookies rapidly
answered as a matter of course and absently Yesm

Certainly said Mrs Crim Once you accept a thing about yourself
as established and settled its all right Nobody minds Boys are just
people really

No no Mrs Schofield cried involuntarily

Yes they are returned Aunt Sarah Only theyre not quite so awful
because they havent learned to cover themselves all over with little
pretences When Penrod grows up hell be just the same as he is now
except that whenever he does what he wants to do hell tell himself and
other people a little story about it to make his reason for doing it
seem nice and pretty and noble

No I wont said Penrod suddenly

Theres one cookie left observed Aunt Sarah Are you going to eat
it

Well said her greatnephew thoughtfully I guess I better

Why asked the old lady Why do you guess youd better

Well said Penrod with a full mouth it might get all dried up if
nobody took it and get thrown out and wasted

Youre beginning finely Mrs Crim remarked A year ago youd have
taken the cookie without the same sense of thrift

Maam

Nothing I see that youre twelve years old thats all There are more
cookies Penrod She went away returning with a fresh supply and the
observation Of course youll be sick before the days over you might
as well get a good start

Mrs Schofield looked thoughtful Aunt Sarah she ventured dont you
really think we improve as we get older

Meaning said the old lady that Penrod hasnt much chance to escape
the penitentiary if he doesnt Well we do learn to restrain ourselves
in some things and there are people who really want someone else to
take the last cookie though they arent very common But its all
right the world seems to be getting on She gazed whimsically upon her
greatnephew and added Of course when you watch a boy and think about
him it doesnt seem to be getting on very fast

Penrod moved uneasily in his chair he was conscious that he was her
topic but unable to make out whether or not her observations were
complimentary he inclined to think they were not Mrs Crim settled the
question for him

I suppose Penrod is regarded as the neighbourhood curse

Oh no cried Mrs Schofield He

I dare say the neighbours are right continued the old lady placidly
Hes had to repeat the history of the race and go through all the
stages from the primordial to barbarism You dont expect boys to be
civilized do you

Well I

You might as well expect eggs to crow No youve got to take boys as
they are and learn to know them as they are

Naturally Aunt Sarah said Mrs Schofield I KNOW Penrod

Aunt Sarah laughed heartily Do you think his father knows him too

Of course men are different Mrs Schofield returned apologetically
But a mother knows

Penrod said Aunt Sarah solemnly does your father understand you

Maam

About as much as hed understand Sitting Bull she laughed

And Ill tell you what your mother thinks you are Penrod Her real
belief is that youre a novice in a convent

Maam

Aunt Sarah

I know she thinks that because whenever you dont behave like a novice
shes disappointed in you And your father really believes that youre
a decorous welltrained young business man and whenever you dont
live up to that standard you get on his nerves and he thinks you need a
walloping Im sure a day very seldom passes without their both saying
they dont know what on earth to do with you Does whipping do you any
good Penrod

Maam

Go on and finish the lemonade theres about glassful left Oh take
it take it and dont say why Of COURSE youre a little pig

Penrod laughed gratefully his eyes fixed upon her over the rim of his
uptilted glass

Fill yourself up uncomfortably said the old lady Youre twelve
years old and you ought to be happyif you arent anything else Its
taken over nineteen hundred years of Christianity and some hundreds of
thousands of years of other things to produce you and there you sit

Maam

Itll be your turn to struggle and muss things up for the betterment
of posterity soon enough said Aunt Sarah Crim Drink your lemonade


CHAPTER XXIX FANCHON

Aunt Sarahs a funny old lady Penrod observed on the way back to the
town Whats she want me to give papa this old sling for Last thing
she said was to be sure not to forget to give it to him HE dont want
it and she said herself it aint any good Shes older than you or
papa isnt she

About fifty years older answered Mrs Schofield turning upon him a
stare of perplexity Dont cut into the leather with your new knife
dear the livery man might ask us to pay ifNo I wouldnt scrape
the paint off eithernor whittle your shoe with it COULDNT you put
it up until we get home

We goin straight home

No Were going to stop at Mrs Gelbraiths and ask a strange little
girl to come to your party this afternoon

Who

Her name is Fanchon Shes Mrs Gelbraiths little niece

What makes her so queer

I didnt say shes queer

You said

No I mean that she is a stranger She lives in New York and has come
to visit here

Whats she live in New York for

Because her parents live there You must be very nice to her Penrod
she has been very carefully brought up Besides she doesnt know the
children here and you must help to keep her from feeling lonely at your
party

Yesm

When they reached Mrs Gelbraiths Penrod sat patiently humped upon a
gilt chair during the lengthy exchange of greetings between his mother
and Mrs Gelbraith That is one of the things a boy must learn to bear
when his mother meets a compeer there is always a long and dreary wait
for him while the two appear to be using strange symbols of speech
talking for the greater part it seems to him simultaneously and
employing a wholly incomprehensible system of emphasis at other times
not in vogue Penrod twisted his legs his cap and his nose

Here she is Mrs Gelbraith cried unexpectedly and a darkhaired
demure person entered the room wearing a look of gracious social
expectancy In years she was eleven in manner about sixtyfive
and evidently had lived much at court She performed a curtsey in
acknowledgment of Mrs Schofields greeting and bestowed her hand
upon Penrod who had entertained no hope of such an honour showed his
surprise that it should come to him and was plainly unable to decide
what to do about it

Fanchon dear said Mrs Gelbraith take Penrod out in the yard for a
while and play

Let go the little girls hand Penrod Mrs Schofield laughed as the
children turned toward the door

Penrod hastily dropped the small hand and exclaiming with simple
honesty Why _I_ dont want it followed Fanchon out into the
sunshiny yard where they came to a halt and surveyed each other

Penrod stared awkwardly at Fanchon no other occupation suggesting
itself to him while Fanchon with the utmost coolness made a very
thorough visual examination of Penrod favouring him with an estimating
scrutiny which lasted until he literally wiggled Finally she spoke

Where do you buy your ties she asked

What

Where do you buy your neckties Papa gets his at Skoones You ought to
get yours there Im sure the one youre wearing isnt from Skoones

Skoones Penrod repeated Skoones

On Fifth Avenue said Fanchon Its a very smart shop the men say

Men echoed Penrod in a hazy whisper Men

Where do your people go in summer inquired the lady WE go to Long
Shore but so many middleclass people have begun coming there mamma
thinks of leaving The middle classes are simply awful dont you
think

What

Theyre so boorjaw You speak French of course

Me

We ran over to Paris last year Its lovely dont you think Dont you
LOVE the Rue de la Paix

Penrod wandered in a labyrinth This girl seemed to be talking but her
words were dumfounding and of course there was no way for him to know
that he was really listening to her mother It was his first meeting
with one of those grownup little girls wonderful product of the winter
apartment and summer hotel and Fanchon an only child was a star of
the brand He began to feel resentful

I suppose she went on Ill find everything here fearfully Western
Some nice people called yesterday though Do you know the Magsworth
Bittses Auntie says theyre charming Will Roddy be at your party

I guess he will returned Penrod finding this intelligible The
mutt

Really Fanchon exclaimed airily Arent you great pals with him

Whats pals

Good heavens Dont you know what it means to say youre great pals
with any one You ARE an odd child

It was too much

Oh Bugs said Penrod

This bit of ruffianism had a curious effect Fanchon looked upon him
with sudden favour

I like you Penrod she said in an odd way and whatever else there
may have been in her manner there certainly was no shyness

Oh Bugs This repetition may have lacked gallantry but it was
uttered in no very decided tone Penrod was shaken

Yes I do She stepped closer to him smiling Your hair is ever so
pretty

Sailors parrots swear like mariners they say and gay mothers ought to
realize that all children are imitative for as the precocious Fanchon
leaned toward Penrod the manner in which she looked into his eyes might
have made a thoughtful observer wonder where she had learned her pretty
ways

Penrod was even more confused than he had been by her previous
mysteries but his confusion was of a distinctly pleasant and alluring
nature he wanted more of it Looking intentionally into another
persons eyes is an act unknown to childhood and Penrods discovery
that it could be done was sensational He had never thought of looking
into the eyes of Marjorie Jones

Despite all anguish contumely tar and Maurice Levy he still secretly
thought of Marjorie with pathetic constancy as his beauthough that
is not how he would have spelled it Marjorie was beautiful her
curls were long and the colour of amber her nose was straight and
her freckles were honest she was much prettier than this accomplished
visitor But beauty is not all

I do breathed Fanchon softly

She seemed to him a fairy creature from some rosier world than this So
humble is the human heart it glorifies and makes glamorous almost any
poor thing that says to it I like you

Penrod was enslaved He swallowed coughed scratched the back of his
neck and said disjointedly

WellI dont care if you want to I just as soon

Well dance together said Fanchon at your party

I guess so I just as soon

Dont you want to Penrod

Well Im willing to

No Say you WANT to

Well

He used his toe as a gimlet boring into the ground his wide open eyes
staring with intense vacancy at a button on his sleeve

His mother appeared upon the porch in departure calling farewells over
her shoulder to Mrs Gelbraith who stood in the doorway

Say it whispered Fanchon

Well I just as SOON

She seemed satisfied



CHAPTER XXX THE BIRTHDAY PARTY

A dancing floor had been laid upon a platform in the yard when Mrs
Schofield and her son arrived at their own abode and a white and
scarlet striped canopy was in process of erection overhead to shelter
the dancers from the sun Workmen were busy everywhere under the
direction of Margaret and the smitten heart of Penrod began to beat
rapidly All this was for him he was Twelve

After lunch he underwent an elaborate toilette and murmured not For
the first time in his life he knew the wish to be sandpapered waxed
and polished to the highest possible degree And when the operation was
over he stood before the mirror in new bloom feeling encouraged to
hope that his resemblance to his father was not so strong as Aunt Sarah
seemed to think

The white gloves upon his hands had a pleasant smell he found and as
he came down the stairs he had great content in the twinkling of his
new dancing slippers He stepped twice on each step the better to enjoy
their effect and at the same time he deeply inhaled the odour of the
gloves In spite of everything Penrod had his social capacities
Already it is to be perceived that there were in him the makings of a
cotillon leader

Then came from the yard a sound of tuning instruments squeak of fiddle
croon of cello a falling triangle ringing and tinkling to the floor
and he turned pale

Chosen guests began to arrive while Penrod suffering from stagefright
and perspiration stood beside his mother in the drawingroom
to receive them He greeted unfamiliar acquaintances and intimate
fellowcriminals with the same frigidity murmuring M glad to see
y to all alike largely increasing the embarrassment which always
prevails at the beginning of childrens festivities His unnatural pomp
and circumstance had so thoroughly upset him in truth that Marjorie
Jones received a distinct shock now to be related Doctor Thrope the
kind old clergyman who had baptized Penrod came in for a moment to
congratulate the boy and had just moved away when it was Marjories
turn in the line of children to speak to Penrod She gave him what she
considered a forgiving look and because of the occasion addressed him
in a perfectly courteous manner

I wish you many happy returns of the day Penrod

Thank you sir he returned following Dr Thrope with a glassy
stare in which there was absolutely no recognition of Marjorie Then he
greeted Maurice Levy who was next to Marjorie M glad to see y

Dumfounded Marjorie turned aside and stood near observing Penrod with
gravity It was the first great surprise of her life Customarily
she had seemed to place his character somewhere between that of the
professional rioter and that of the orangoutang nevertheless her
manner at times just hinted a consciousness that this Caliban was her
property Wherefore she stared at him incredulously as his head bobbed
up and down in the dancingschool bow greeting his guests Then she
heard an adult voice near her exclaim

What an exquisite child

Mariorie galanced upa little consciously though she was used to
itnaturally curious to ascertain who was speaking of her It was Sam
Williams mother addressing Mrs Bassett both being present to help
Mrs Schofield make the festivities festive

Exquisite

Here was a second heavy surprise for Marjorie they were not looking
at her They were looking with beaming approval at a girl she had never
seen a dark and modish stranger of singularly composed and yet modest
aspect Her downcast eyes becoming in one thus entering a crowded room
were all that produced the effect of modesty counteracting something
about her which might have seemed too assured She was very slender
very dainty and her apparel was disheartening to the other girls it
was of a knowing picturesqueness wholly unfamiliar to them There was
a delicate trace of powder upon the lobe of Fanchons left ear and
the outlines of her eyelids if very closely scrutinized would have
revealed successful experimentation with a burnt match

Marjories lovely eyes dilated she learned the meaning of hatred at
first sight Observing the stranger with instinctive suspicion all
at once she seemed to herself awkward Poor Marjorie underwent that
experience which hearty healthy little girls and big girls undergo at
one time or anotherfrom heels to head she felt herself somehow too
THICK

Fanchon leaned close to Penrod and whispered in his ear

Dont you forget

Penrod blushed

Marjorie saw the blush Her lovely eyes opened even wider and in them
there began to grow a light It was the light of indignationat least
people whose eyes glow with that light always call it indignation

Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior approached Fanchon when she had made
her courtesy to Mrs Schofield Fanchon whispered in Rodericks ear
also

Your hair is pretty Roddy Dont forget what you said yesterday

Roderick likewise blushed

Maurice Levy captivated by the newcomers appearance pressed close to
Roderick

Give us an intaduction Roddy

Roddy being either reluctant or unable to perform the rite Fanchon took
matters into her own hands and was presently favourably impressed with
Maurice receiving the information that his tie had been brought to him
by his papa from Skoones whereupon she privately informed him that she
liked wavy hair and arranged to dance with him Fanchon also thought
sandy hair attractive Sam Williams discovered a few minutes later and
so catholic was her taste that a ring of boys quite encircled her before
the musicians in the yard struck up their thrilling march and Mrs
Schofield brought Penrod to escort the lady from outoftown to the
dancing pavilion

Headed by this pair the children sought partners and paraded solemnly
out of the front door and round a corner of the house There they found
the gay marquee the small orchestra seated on the lawn at one side
of it and a punch bowl of lemonade inviting attention under a tree
Decorously the small couples stepped upon the platform one after
another and began to dance

Its not much like a childrens party in our day Mrs Williams said
to Penrods mother Wed have been playing Quakermeeting Clapin
Clapout or Going to Jerusalem I suppose

Yes or Postoffice and Dropthehandkerchief said Mrs
Schofield Things change so quickly Imagine asking little Fanchon
Gelbraith to play London Bridge Penrod seems to be having a difficult
time with her poor boy he wasnt a shining light in the dancing
class

However Penrods difficulty was not precisely of the kind his mother
supposed Fanchon was showing him a new step which she taught her
next partner in turn continuing instructions during the dancing The
children crowded the floor and in the kaleidoscopic jumble of bobbing
heads and intermingling figures her extremely different style of
motion was unobserved by the older people who looked on nodding time
benevolently

Fanchon fascinated girls as well as boys Many of the former eagerly
sought her acquaintance and thronged about her between the dances when
accepting the deference due a cosmopolitan and an oracle of the mode
she gave demonstrations of the new step to succeeding groups professing
astonishment to find it unknown it had been all the go she
explained at the Long Shore Casino for fully two seasons She
pronounced slow a Fancy Dance executed during an intermission by
Baby Rennsdale and Georgie Bassett giving it as her opinion that Miss
Rennsdale and Mr Bassett were dead ones and she expressed surprise
that the punch bowl contained lemonade and not champagne

The dancing continued the new step gaining instantly in popularity
fresh couples adventuring with every number The word step is somewhat
misleading nothing done with the feet being vital to the evolutions
introduced by Fanchon Fanchons dance came from the Orient by a
roundabout way pausing in Spain taking on a Gallic frankness in
gallantry at the Bal Bullier in Paris combining with a relative from
the South Seas encountered in San Francisco flavouring itself with
a carefree negroid abandon in New Orleans and accumulating too
something inexpressible from Mexico and South America it kept
throughout its travels to the underworld or to circles where nature
is extremely frank and rank until at last it reached the dives of New
York when it immediately broke out in what is called civilized
society Thereafter it spread in variously modified formssome of
them disinfectedto wateringplaces and thence carried by hundreds of
older male and female Fanchons over the country being eagerly adopted
everywhere and made wholly pure and respectable by the supreme moral
axiom that anything is all right if enough people do it Everybody was
doing it

Not quite everybody It was perhaps some test of this dance that earth
could furnish no more grotesque sight than that of children doing it

Earth assisted by Fanchon was furnishing this sight at Penrods party
By the time icecream and cake arrived about half the guests had
either been initiated into the mysteries by Fanchon or were learning
by imitation and the education of the other half was resumed with the
dancing when the attendant ladies unconscious of what was happening
withdrew into the house for tea

That orchestras a dead one Fanchon remarked to Penrod We ought to
liven them up a little

She approached the musicians

Dont you know she asked the leader the Slingo Sligo Slide

The leader giggled nodded rapped with his bow upon his violin and
Penrod following Fanchon back upon the dancing floor blindly brushed
with his elbow a solitary little figure standing aloof on the lawn at
the edge of the platform

It was Marjorie

In no mood to approve of anything introduced by Fanchon she had
scornfully refused from the first to dance the new step and
because of its bonfire popularity found herself neglected in a society
where she had reigned as beauty and belle Faithless Penrod dazed by
the sweeping Fanchon had utterly forgotten the amber curls he had not
once asked Marjorie to dance All afternoon the light of indignation had
been growing brighter in her eyes though Maurice Levys defection
to the lady from New York had not fanned this flame From the moment
Fanchon had whispered familiarly in Penrods ear and Penrod had
blushed Marjorie had been occupied exclusively with resentment against
that guilty pair It seemed to her that Penrod had no right to allow a
strange girl to whisper in his ear that his blushing when the strange
girl did it was atrocious and that the strange girl herself ought to
be arrested

Forgotten by the merrymakers Marjorie stood alone upon the lawn
clenching her small fists watching the new dance at its high tide
and hating it with a hatred that made every inch of her tremble And
perhaps because jealousy is a great awakener of the virtues she had
a perception of something in it worse than lack of dignitysomething
vaguely but outrageously reprehensible Finally when Penrod brushed by
her touched her with his elbow and did not even see her Marjories
state of mind not unmingled with emotion became dangerous In fact a
trained nurse chancing to observe her at this juncture would probably
have advised that she be taken home and put to bed Marjorie was on the
verge of hysterics

She saw Fanchon and Penrod assume the double embrace required by the
dance the Slingo Sligo Slide burst from the orchestra like the
lunatic shriek of a ginmaddened nigger and all the little couples
began to bob and dip and sway

Marjorie made a scene She sprang upon the platform and stamped her
foot

Penrod Schofield she shouted You BEHAVE yourself

The remarkable girl took Penrod by the ear By his ear she swung him
away from Fanchon and faced him toward the lawn

You march straight out of here she commanded

Penrod marched

He was stunned obeyed automatically without question and had very
little realization of what was happening to him Altogether and without
reason he was in precisely the condition of an elderly spouse detected
in flagrant misbehaviour Marjorie similarly was in precisely the
condition of the party who detects such misbehaviour It may be added
that she had acted with a promptness a decision and a disregard of
social consequences all to be commended to the attention of ladies in
like predicament

You ought to be ashamed of yourself she raged when they reached the
lawn Arent you ashamed of yourself

What for he inquired helplessly

You be quiet

But whatd _I_ do Marjorie _I_ havent done anything to you he
pleaded I havent even seen you all aftern

You be quiet she cried tears filling her eyes Keep still You ugly
boy Shut up

She slapped him

He should have understood from this how much she cared for him But he
rubbed his cheek and declared ruefully

Ill never speak to you again

You will too she sobbed passionately

I will not

He turned to leave her but paused

His mother his sister Margaret and their grownup friends had finished
their tea and were approaching from the house Other parents and
guardians were with them coming for their children and there were
carriages and automobiles waiting in the street But the Slingo Slide
went on regardless

The group of grownup people hesitated and came to a halt gazing at the
pavilion

What are they doing gasped Mrs Williams blushing deeply What is
it What IS it

WHAT IS IT Mrs Gelbraith echoed in a frightened whisper WHAT

Theyre Tangoing cried Margaret Schofield Or Bunny Hugging or
Grizzly Bearing or

Theyre only Turkey Trotting said Robert Williams

With fearful outcries the mothers aunts and sisters rushed upon the
pavilion

Of course it was dreadful said Mrs Schofield an hour later
rendering her lord an account of the day but it was every bit the
fault of that one extraordinary child And of all the quiet demur
little thingsthat is I mean when she first came We all spoke of how
exquisite she seemedso well trained so finished Eleven years old I
never saw anything like her in my life

I suppose its the New Child her husband grunted

And to think of her saying there ought to have been champagne in the
lemonade

Probably shed forgotten to bring her pocket flask he suggested
musingly

But arent you proud of Penrod cried Penrods mother It was just as
I told you he was standing clear outside the pavilion

I never thought to see the day And Penrod was the only boy not doing
it the only one to refuse ALL the others were

Every one she returned triumphantly Even Georgie Bassett

Well said Mr Schofield patting her on the shoulder I guess we can
hold up our heads at last



CHAPTER XXXI OVER THE FENCE

Penrod was out in the yard staring at the empty marquee The sun was on
the horizon line so far behind the back fence and a western window of
the house blazed in gold unbearable to the eye his day was nearly
over He sighed and took from the inside pocket of his new jacket the
slingshot aunt Sarah Crim had given him that morning

He snapped the rubbers absently They held fast and his next impulse
was entirely irresistible He found a shapely stone fitted it to the
leather and drew back the ancient catapult for a shot A sparrow hopped
upon a branch between him and the house and he aimed at the sparrow
but the reflection from the dazzling window struck in his eyes as he
loosed the leather

He missed the sparrow but not the window There was a loud crash
and to his horror he caught a glimpse of his father stricken in
midshaving ducking a shower of broken glass glittering razor
flourishing wildly Words crashed with the glass stentorian words
fragmentary but collossal

Penrod stood petrified a broken sling in his hand He could hear his
parents booming descent of the back stairs instant and furious and
then redhot above white lather Mr Schofield burst out of the kitchen
door and hurtled forth upon his son

What do you mean he demanded shaking Penrod by the shoulder Ten
minutes ago for the very first time in our lives your mother and I
were saying we were proud of you and here you go and throw a rock at me
through the window when Im shaving for dinner

I didnt Penrod quavered I was shooting at a sparrow and the sun
got in his eyes and the sling broke

What sling

Thisn

Whered you get that devilish thing Dont you know Ive forbidden you
a thousand times

It aint mine said Penrod Its yours

What

Yes sir said the boy meekly Aunt Sarah Crim gave it to me this
morning and told me to give it back to you She said she took it away
from you thirtyfive years ago You killed her hen she said She told
me some more to tell you but Ive forgotten

Oh said Mr Schofield

He took the broken sling in his hand looked at it long and
thoughtfullyand he looked longer and quite as thoughtfully at
Penrod Then he turned away and walked toward the house

Im sorry papa said Penrod

Mr Schofield coughed and as he reached the door called back but
without turning his head

Never mind little boy A broken window isnt much harm

When he had gone in Penrod wandered down the yard to the back fence
climbed upon it and sat in reverie there

A slight figure appeared likewise upon a fence beyond two neighbouring
yards

Yay Penrod called comrade Sam Williams

Yay returned Penrod mechanically

I caught Billy Blue Hill shouted Sam describing retribution in a
manner perfectly clear to his friend You were mighty lucky to get out
of it

I know that

You wouldnt of if it hadnt been for Marjorie

Well dont I know that Penrod shouted with heat

Well so long called Sam dropping from his fence and the friendly
voice came then more faintly Many happy returns of the day Penrod

And now a plaintive little whine sounded from below Penrods feet and
looking down he saw that Duke his wistful old scraggly dog sat in
the grass gazing seekingly up at him

The last shaft of sunshine of that day fell graciously and like a
blessing upon the boy sitting on the fence Years afterward a quiet
sunset would recall to him sometimes the gentle evening of his twelfth
birthday and bring him the picture of his boy self sitting in rosy
light upon the fence gazing pensively down upon his wistful scraggly
little old dog Duke But something else surpassing he would remember
of that hour for in the side street close by a pink skirt flickered
from behind a shade tree to the shelter of the fence there was a gleam
of amber curls and Penrod started as something like a tiny white wing
fluttered by his head and there came to his ears the sound of a light
laugh and of light footsteps departing the laughter tremulous the
footsteps fleet

In the grass between Dukes forepaws there lay a white note folded in
the shape of a cocked hat and the sun sent forth a final amazing glory
as Penrod opened it and read

Your my bow
