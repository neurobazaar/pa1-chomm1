PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE



LO praise of the prowess of peoplekings
of speararmed Danes in days long sped
we have heard and what honor the athelings won
Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes
from many a tribe the meadbench tore
awing the earls Since erst he lay
friendless a foundling fate repaid him
for he waxed under welkin in wealth he throve
till before him the folk both far and near
who house by the whalepath heard his mandate
gave him gifts a good king he
To him an heir was afterward born
a son in his halls whom heaven sent
to favor the folk feeling their woe
that erst they had lacked an earl for leader
so long a while the Lord endowed him
the Wielder of Wonder with worlds renown
Famed was this Beowulf 0a far flew the boast of him
son of Scyld in the Scandian lands
So becomes it a youth to quit him well
with his fathers friends by fee and gift
that to aid him aged in after days
come warriors willing should war draw nigh
liegemen loyal by lauded deeds
shall an earl have honor in every clan

Forth he fared at the fated moment
sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God
Then they bore him over to oceans billow
loving clansmen as late he charged them
while wielded words the winsome Scyld
the leader beloved who long had ruled
In the roadstead rocked a ringdight vessel
iceflecked outbound athelings barge
there laid they down their darling lord
on the breast of the boat the breakerofrings 0b
by the mast the mighty one Many a treasure
fetched from far was freighted with him
No ship have I known so nobly dight
with weapons of war and weeds of battle
with breastplate and blade on his bosom lay
a heaped hoard that hence should go
far oer the flood with him floating away
No less these loaded the lordly gifts
thanes huge treasure than those had done
who in former time forth had sent him
sole on the seas a suckling child
High oer his head they hoist the standard
a goldwove banner let billows take him
gave him to ocean Grave were their spirits
mournful their mood No man is able
to say in sooth no son of the halls
no hero neath heaven  who harbored that freight



I

Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings
leader beloved and long he ruled
in fame with all folk since his father had gone
away from the world till awoke an heir
haughty Healfdene who held through life
sage and sturdy the Scyldings glad
Then one after one there woke to him
to the chieftain of clansmen children four
Heorogar then Hrothgar then Halga brave
and I heard that  was  s queen
the Heathoscylfings helpmate dear
To Hrothgar was given such glory of war
such honor of combat that all his kin
obeyed him gladly till great grew his band
of youthful comrades It came in his mind
to bid his henchmen a hall uprear
a master meadhouse mightier far
than ever was seen by the sons of earth
and within it then to old and young
he would all allot that the Lord had sent him
save only the land and the lives of his men
Wide I heard was the work commanded
for many a tribe this midearth round
to fashion the folkstead It fell as he ordered
in rapid achievement that ready it stood there
of halls the noblest Heorot 1a he named it
whose message had might in many a land
Not reckless of promise the rings he dealt
treasure at banquet there towered the hall
high gabled wide the hot surge waiting
of furious flame 1b Nor far was that day
when father and soninlaw stood in feud
for warfare and hatred that woke again 1c
With envy and anger an evil spirit
endured the dole in his dark abode
that he heard each day the din of revel
high in the hall there harps rang out
clear song of the singer He sang who knew 1d
tales of the early time of man
how the Almighty made the earth
fairest fields enfolded by water
set triumphant sun and moon
for a light to lighten the landdwellers
and braided bright the breast of earth
with limbs and leaves made life for all
of mortal beings that breathe and move
So lived the clansmen in cheer and revel
a winsome life till one began
to fashion evils that field of hell
Grendel this monster grim was called
marchriever 1e mighty in moorland living
in fen and fastness fief of the giants
the hapless wight a while had kept
since the Creator his exile doomed
On kin of Cain was the killing avenged
by sovran God for slaughtered Abel
Ill fared his feud 1f and far was he driven
for the slaughters sake from sight of men
Of Cain awoke all that woful breed
Etins 1g and elves and evilspirits
as well as the giants that warred with God
weary while but their wage was paid them



II

WENT he forth to find at fall of night
that haughty house and heed wherever
the RingDanes outrevelled to rest had gone
Found within it the atheling band
asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow
of human hardship Unhallowed wight
grim and greedy he grasped betimes
wrathful reckless from restingplaces
thirty of the thanes and thence he rushed
fain of his fell spoil faring homeward
laden with slaughter his lair to seek
Then at the dawning as day was breaking
the might of Grendel to men was known
then after wassail was wail uplifted
loud moan in the morn The mighty chief
atheling excellent unblithe sat
labored in woe for the loss of his thanes
when once had been traced the trail of the fiend
spirit accurst too cruel that sorrow
too long too loathsome Not late the respite
with night returning anew began
ruthless murder he recked no whit
firm in his guilt of the feud and crime
They were easy to find who elsewhere sought
in room remote their rest at night
bed in the bowers 2a when that bale was shown
was seen in sooth with surest token 
the hallthanes 2b hate Such held themselves
far and fast who the fiend outran
Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill
one against all until empty stood
that lordly building and long it bode so
Twelve years tide the trouble he bore
sovran of Scyldings sorrows in plenty
boundless cares There came unhidden
tidings true to the tribes of men
in sorrowful songs how ceaselessly Grendel
harassed Hrothgar what hate he bore him
what murder and massacre many a year
feud unfading  refused consent
to deal with any of Danelands earls
make pact of peace or compound for gold
still less did the wise men ween to get
great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands
But the evil one ambushed old and young
deathshadow dark and dogged them still
lured or lurked in the livelong night
of misty moorlands men may say not
where the haunts of these HellRunes 2c be
Such heaping of horrors the hater of men
lonely roamer wrought unceasing
harassings heavy Oer Heorot he lorded
goldbright hall in gloomy nights
and neer could the prince 2d approach his throne
 twas judgment of God  or have joy in his hall
Sore was the sorrow to Scyldingsfriend
heartrending misery Many nobles
sat assembled and searched out counsel
how it were best for boldhearted men
against harassing terror to try their hand
Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes
altarofferings asked with words 2e
that the slayerofsouls would succor give them
for the pain of their people Their practice this
their heathen hope twas Hell they thought of
in mood of their mind Almighty they knew not
Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord
nor HeavensHelmet heeded they ever
WielderofWonder  Woe for that man
who in harm and hatred hales his soul
to fiery embraces  nor favor nor change
awaits he ever But well for him
that after deathday may draw to his Lord
and friendship find in the Fathers arms



III

THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene
with the woe of these days not wisest men
assuaged his sorrow too sore the anguish
loathly and long that lay on his folk
most baneful of burdens and bales of the night

This heard in his home Hygelacs thane
great among Geats of Grendels doings
He was the mightiest man of valor
in that same day of this our life
stalwart and stately A stout wavewalker
he bade make ready Yon battleking said he
far oer the swanroad he fain would seek
the noble monarch who needed men
The princes journey by prudent folk
was little blamed though they loved him dear
they whetted the hero and hailed good omens
And now the bold one from bands of Geats
comrades chose the keenest of warriors
eer he could find with fourteen men
the seawood 3a he sought and sailor proved
led them on to the lands confines
Time had now flown 3b afloat was the ship
boat under bluff On board they climbed
warriors ready waves were churning
sea with sand the sailors bore
on the breast of the bark their bright array
their mail and weapons the men pushed off
on its willing way the wellbraced craft
Then moved oer the waters by might of the wind
that bark like a bird with breast of foam
till in season due on the second day
the curved prow such course had run
that sailors now could see the land
seacliffs shining steep high hills
headlands broad Their haven was found
their journey ended Up then quickly
the Weders 3c clansmen climbed ashore
anchored their seawood with armor clashing
and gear of battle God they thanked
or passing in peace oer the paths of the sea
Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman
a warden that watched the waterside
how they bore oer the gangway glittering shields
wargear in readiness wonder seized him
to know what manner of men they were
Straight to the strand his steed he rode
Hrothgars henchman with hand of might
he shook his spear and spake in parley
Who are ye then ye armed men
mailed folk that yon mighty vessel
have urged thus over the ocean ways
here oer the waters A warden I
sentinel set oer the seamarch here
lest any foe to the folk of Danes
with harrying fleet should harm the land
No aliens ever at ease thus bore them
lindenwielders 3d yet wordofleave
clearly ye lack from clansmen here
my folks agreement  A greater neer saw I
of warriors in world than is one of you 
yon hero in harness No henchman he
worthied by weapons if witness his features
his peerless presence I pray you though tell
your folk and home lest hence ye fare
suspect to wander your way as spies
in Danish land Now dwellers afar
oceantravellers take from me
simple advice the sooner the better
I hear of the country whence ye came



IV

To him the stateliest spake in answer
the warriors leader his wordhoard unlocked 
We are by kin of the clan of Geats
and Hygelacs own hearthfellows we
To folk afar was my father known
noble atheling Ecgtheow named
Full of winters he fared away
aged from earth he is honored still
through width of the world by wise men all
To thy lord and liege in loyal mood
we hasten hither to Healfdenes son
peopleprotector be pleased to advise us
To that mightyone come we on mickle errand
to the lord of the Danes nor deem I right
that aught be hidden We hear  thou knowest
if sooth it is  the saying of men
that amid the Scyldings a scathing monster
dark illdoer in dusky nights
shows terrific his rage unmatched
hatred and murder To Hrothgar I
in greatness of soul would succor bring
so the WiseandBrave 4a may worst his foes 
if ever the end of ills is fated
of cruel contest if cure shall follow
and the boiling carewaves cooler grow
else ever afterward anguishdays
he shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place
high on its hill that house unpeered
Astride his steed the strandward answered
clansman unquailing The keensouled thane
must be skilled to sever and sunder duly
words and works if he well intends
I gather this band is graciously bent
to the Scyldings master March then bearing
weapons and weeds the way I show you
I will bid my men your boat meanwhile
to guard for fear lest foemen come 
your newtarred ship by shore of ocean
faithfully watching till once again
it waft oer the waters those wellloved thanes
 windingneckd wood  to Weders bounds
heroes such as the hest of fate
shall succor and save from the shock of war
They bent them to march  the boat lay still
fettered by cable and fast at anchor
broadbosomed ship  Then shone the boars 4b
over the cheekguard chased with gold
keen and gleaming guard it kept
oer the man of war as marched along
heroes in haste till the hall they saw
broad of gable and bright with gold
that was the fairest mid folk of earth
of houses neath heaven where Hrothgar lived
and the gleam of it lightened oer lands afar
The sturdy shieldsman showed that bright
burgoftheboldest bade them go
straightway thither his steed then turned
hardy hero and hailed them thus 
Tis time that I fare from you Father Almighty
in grace and mercy guard you well
safe in your seekings Seaward I go
gainst hostile warriors hold my watch



V

STONEBRIGHT the street 5a it showed the way
to the crowd of clansmen Corselets glistened
handforged hard on their harness bright
the steel ring sang as they strode along
in mail of battle and marched to the hall
There weary of ocean the wall along
they set their bucklers their broad shields down
and bowed them to bench the breastplates clanged
wargear of men their weapons stacked
spears of the seafarers stood together
graytipped ash that iron band
was worthily weaponed  A warrior proud
asked of the heroes their home and kin
Whence now bear ye burnished shields
harness gray and helmets grim
spears in multitude Messenger I
Hrothgars herald Heroes so many
neer met I as strangers of mood so strong
Tis plain that for prowess not plunged into exile
for highhearted valor Hrothgar ye seek
Him the sturdyinwar bespake with words
proud earl of the Weders answer made
hardy neath helmet  Hygelacs we
fellows at board I am Beowulf named
I am seeking to say to the son of Healfdene
this mission of mine to thy masterlord
the doughty prince if he deign at all
grace that we greet him the good one now
Wulfgar spake the Wendles chieftain
whose might of mind to many was known
his courage and counsel The king of Danes
the Scyldings friend I fain will tell
the BreakerofRings as the boon thou askest
the famed prince of thy faring hither
and swiftly after such answer bring
as the doughty monarch may deign to give
Hied then in haste to where Hrothgar sat
whitehaired and old his earls about him
till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there
of the Danish king good courtier he
Wulfgar spake to his winsome lord 
Hither have fared to thee farcome men
oer the paths of ocean people of Geatland
and the stateliest there by his sturdy band
is Beowulf named This boon they seek
that they my master may with thee
have speech at will nor spurn their prayer
to give them hearing gracious Hrothgar
In weeds of the warrior worthy they
methinks of our liking their leader most surely
a hero that hither his henchmen has led



VI

HROTHGAR answered helmet of Scyldings 
I knew him of yore in his youthful days
his aged father was Ecgtheow named
to whom at home gave Hrethel the Geat
his only daughter Their offspring bold
fares hither to seek the steadfast friend
And seamen too have said me this 
who carried my gifts to the Geatish court
thither for thanks  he has thirty mens
heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand
the boldinbattle Blessed God
out of his mercy this man hath sent
to Danes of the West as I ween indeed
against horror of Grendel I hope to give
the good youth gold for his gallant thought
Be thou in haste and bid them hither
clan of kinsmen to come before me
and add this word  they are welcome guests
to folk of the Danes
To the door of the hall
Wulfgar went and the word declared 
To you this message my master sends
EastDanes king that your kin he knows
hardy heroes and hails you all
welcome hither oer waves of the sea
Ye may wend your way in warattire
and under helmets Hrothgar greet
but let here the battleshields bide your parley
and wooden warshafts wait its end
Uprose the mighty one ringed with his men
brave band of thanes some bode without
battlegear guarding as bade the chief
Then hied that troop where the herald led them
under Heorots roof the hero strode
hardy neath helm till the hearth he neared
Beowulf spake  his breastplate gleamed
warnet woven by wit of the smith 
Thou Hrothgar hail Hygelacs I
kinsman and follower Fame a plenty
have I gained in youth These Grendeldeeds
I heard in my homeland heralded clear
Seafarers say how stands this hall
of buildings best for your band of thanes
empty and idle when evening sun
in the harbor of heaven is hidden away
So my vassals advised me well 
brave and wise the best of men 
O sovran Hrothgar to seek thee here
for my nerve and my might they knew full well
Themselves had seen me from slaughter come
bloodflecked from foes where five I bound
and that wild brood worsted I the waves I slew
nicors 6a by night in need and peril
avenging the Weders 6b whose woe they sought 
crushing the grim ones Grendel now
monster cruel be mine to quell
in single battle So from thee
thou sovran of the ShiningDanes
Scyldingsbulwark a boon I seek 
and Friendofthefolk refuse it not
O Warriorsshield now Ive wandered far 
that I alone with my liegemen here
this hardy band may Heorot purge
More I hear that the monster dire
in his wanton mood of weapons recks not
hence shall I scorn  so Hygelac stay
king of my kindred kind to me 
brand or buckler to bear in the fight
goldcolored targe but with gripe alone
must I front the fiend and fight for life
foe against foe Then faith be his
in the doom of the Lord whom death shall take
Fain I ween if the fight he win
in this hall of gold my Geatish band
will he fearless eat  as oft before 
my noblest thanes Nor needst thou then
to hide my head 6c for his shall I be
dyed in gore if death must take me
and my bloodcovered body hell bear as prey
ruthless devour it the roamerlonely
with my lifeblood redden his lair in the fen
no further for me needst food prepare
To Hygelac send if Hild 6d should take me
best of warweeds warding my breast
armor excellent heirloom of Hrethel
and work of Wayland 6e Fares Wyrd 6f as she must



VII

HROTHGAR spake the Scyldingshelmet 
For fight defensive Friend my Beowulf
to succor and save thou hast sought us here
Thy fathers combat 7a a feud enkindled
when Heatholaf with hand he slew
among the Wylfings his Weder kin
for horror of fighting feared to hold him
Fleeing he sought our SouthDane folk
over surge of ocean the HonorScyldings
when first I was ruling the folk of Danes
wielded youthful this widespread realm
this hoardhold of heroes Heorogar was dead
my elder brother had breathed his last
Healfdenes bairn he was better than I
Straightway the feud with fee 7b I settled
to the Wylfings sent oer watery ridges
treasures olden oaths he 7c swore me
Sore is my soul to say to any
of the race of man what ruth for me
in Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought
what sudden harryings Hallfolk fail me
my warriors wane for Wyrd hath swept them
into Grendels grasp But God is able
this deadly foe from his deeds to turn
Boasted full oft as my beer they drank
earls oer the alecup armed men
that they would bide in the beerhall here
Grendels attack with terror of blades
Then was this meadhouse at morning tide
dyed with gore when the daylight broke
all the boards of the benches bloodbesprinkled
gory the hall I had heroes the less
doughty dearones that death had reft
 But sit to the banquet unbind thy words
hardy hero as heart shall prompt thee

Gathered together the Geatish men
in the banquethall on bench assigned
sturdyspirited sat them down
hardyhearted A henchman attended
carried the carven cup in hand
served the clear mead Oft minstrels sang
blithe in Heorot Heroes revelled
no dearth of warriors Weder and Dane



VIII

UNFERTH spake the son of Ecglaf
who sat at the feet of the Scyldings lord
unbound the battlerunes 8a  Beowulfs quest
sturdy seafarers sorely galled him
ever he envied that other men
should more achieve in middleearth
of fame under heaven than he himself 
Art thou that Beowulf Brecas rival
who emulous swam on the open sea
when for pride the pair of you proved the floods
and wantonly dared in waters deep
to risk your lives No living man
or lief or loath from your labor dire
could you dissuade from swimming the main
Oceantides with your arms ye covered
with strenuous hands the seastreets measured
swam oer the waters Winters storm
rolled the rough waves In realm of sea
a sennight strove ye In swimming he topped thee
had more of main Him at morningtide
billows bore to the Battling Reamas
whence he hied to his home so dear
beloved of his liegemen to land of Brondings
fastness fair where his folk he ruled
town and treasure In triumph oer thee
Beanstans bairn 8b his boast achieved
So ween I for thee a worse adventure
 though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been
in struggle grim  if Grendels approach
thou darst await through the watch of night

Beowulf spake bairn of Ecgtheow 
What a deal hast uttered dear my Unferth
drunken with beer of Breca now
told of his triumph Truth I claim it
that I had more of might in the sea
than any man else more oceanendurance
We twain had talked in time of youth
and made our boast  we were merely boys
striplings still  to stake our lives
far at sea and so we performed it
Naked swords as we swam along
we held in hand with hope to guard us
against the whales Not a whit from me
could he float afar oer the flood of waves
haste oer the billows nor him I abandoned
Together we twain on the tides abode
five nights full till the flood divided us
churning waves and chillest weather
darkling night and the northern wind
ruthless rushed on us rough was the surge
Now the wrath of the seafish rose apace
yet me gainst the monsters my mailed coat
hard and handlinked help afforded 
battlesark braided my breast to ward
garnished with gold There grasped me firm
and haled me to bottom the hated foe
with grimmest gripe Twas granted me though
to pierce the monster with point of sword
with blade of battle huge beast of the sea
was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine



IX

ME thus often the evil monsters
thronging threatened With thrust of my sword
the darling I dealt them due return
Nowise had they bliss from their booty then
to devour their victim vengeful creatures
seated to banquet at bottom of sea
but at break of day by my brand sore hurt
on the edge of ocean up they lay
put to sleep by the sword And since by them
on the fathomless seaways sailorfolk
are never molested  Light from east
came bright Gods beacon the billows sank
so that I saw the seacliffs high
windy walls For Wyrd oft saveth
earl undoomed if he doughty be
And so it came that I killed with my sword
nine of the nicors Of nightfought battles
neer heard I a harder neath heavens dome
nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man
Yet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch
though spent with swimming The sea upbore me
flood of the tide on Finnish land
the welling waters No wise of thee
have I heard men tell such terror of falchions
bitter battle Breca neer yet
not one of you pair in the play of war
such daring deed has done at all
with bloody brand  I boast not of it 
though thou wast the bane 9a of thy brethren dear
thy closest kin whence curse of hell
awaits thee well as thy wit may serve
For I say in sooth thou son of Ecglaf
never had Grendel these grim deeds wrought
monster dire on thy master dear
in Heorot such havoc if heart of thine
were as battlebold as thy boast is loud
But he has found no feud will happen
from swordclash dread of your Danish clan
he vaunts him safe from the VictorScyldings
He forces pledges favors none
of the land of Danes but lustily murders
fights and feasts nor feud he dreads
from SpearDane men But speedily now
shall I prove him the prowess and pride of the Geats
shall bid him battle Blithe to mead
go he that listeth when light of dawn
this morrow morning oer men of earth
etherrobed sun from the south shall beam
Joyous then was the Jewelgiver
hoarhaired warbrave help awaited
the BrightDanes prince from Beowulf hearing
folks good shepherd such firm resolve
Then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding
with winsome words Came Wealhtheow forth
queen of Hrothgar heedful of courtesy
golddecked greeting the guests in hall
and the highborn lady handed the cup
first to the EastDanes heir and warden
bade him be blithe at the beercarouse
the lands beloved one Lustily took he
banquet and beaker battlefamed king

Through the hall then went the Helmings Lady
to younger and older everywhere
carried the cup till come the moment
when the ringgraced queen the royalhearted
to Beowulf bore the beaker of mead
She greeted the Geats lord God she thanked
in wisdoms words that her will was granted
that at last on a hero her hope could lean
for comfort in terrors The cup he took
hardyinwar from Wealhtheows hand
and answer uttered the eagerforcombat
Beowulf spake bairn of Ecgtheow 
This was my thought when my thanes and I
bent to the ocean and entered our boat
that I would work the will of your people
fully or fighting fall in death
in fiends gripe fast I am firm to do
an earls brave deed or end the days
of this life of mine in the meadhall here
Well these words to the woman seemed
Beowulfs battleboast  Bright with gold
the stately dame by her spouse sat down
Again as erst began in hall
warriors wassail and words of power
the proudbands revel till presently
the son of Healfdene hastened to seek
rest for the night he knew there waited
fight for the fiend in that festal hall
when the sheen of the sun they saw no more
and dusk of night sank darkling nigh
and shadowy shapes came striding on
wan under welkin The warriors rose
Man to man he made harangue
Hrothgar to Beowulf bade him hail
let him wield the wine hall a word he added 
Never to any man erst I trusted
since I could heave up hand and shield
this noble DaneHall till now to thee
Have now and hold this house unpeered
remember thy glory thy might declare
watch for the foe No wish shall fail thee
if thou bidest the battle with boldwon life



X

THEN Hrothgar went with his herotrain
defenceofScyldings forth from hall
fain would the warlord Wealhtheow seek
couch of his queen The KingofGlory
against this Grendel a guard had set
so heroes heard a halldefender
who warded the monarch and watched for the monster
In truth the Geats prince gladly trusted
his mettle his might the mercy of God
Cast off then his corselet of iron
helmet from head to his henchman gave 
choicest of weapons  the wellchased sword
bidding him guard the gear of battle
Spake then his Vaunt the valiant man
Beowulf Geat ere the bed be sought 
Of force in fight no feebler I count me
in grim wardeeds than Grendel deems him
Not with the sword then to sleep of death
his life will I give though it lie in my power
No skill is his to strike against me
my shield to hew though he hardy be
bold in battle we both this night
shall spurn the sword if he seek me here
unweaponed for war Let wisest God
sacred Lord on which side soever
doom decree as he deemeth right
Reclined then the chieftain and cheekpillows held
the head of the earl while all about him
seamen hardy on hallbeds sank
None of them thought that thence their steps
to the folk and fastness that fostered them
to the land they loved would lead them back
Full well they wist that on warriors many
battledeath seized in the banquethall
of Danish clan But comfort and help
warweal weaving to Weder folk
the Master gave that by might of one
over their enemy all prevailed
by single strength In sooth tis told
that highest God oer human kind
hath wielded ever  Thro wan night striding
came the walkerinshadow Warriors slept
whose hest was to guard the gabled hall 
all save one Twas widely known
that against Gods will the ghostly ravager
him 10a could not hurl to haunts of darkness
wakeful ready with warriors wrath
bold he bided the battles issue



XI

THEN from the moorland by misty crags
with Gods wrath laden Grendel came
The monster was minded of mankind now
sundry to seize in the stately house
Under welkin he walked till the winepalace there
goldhall of men he gladly discerned
flashing with fretwork Not first time this
that he the home of Hrothgar sought 
yet neer in his lifeday late or early
such hardy heroes such hallthanes found
To the house the warrior walked apace
parted from peace 11a the portal opended
though with forged bolts fast when his fists had
struck it
and baleful he burst in his blatant rage
the houses mouth All hastily then
oer fairpaved floor the fiend trod on
ireful he strode there streamed from his eyes
fearful flashes like flame to see

He spied in hall the heroband
kin and clansmen clustered asleep
hardy liegemen Then laughed his heart
for the monster was minded ere morn should dawn
savage to sever the soul of each
life from body since lusty banquet
waited his will But Wyrd forbade him
to seize any more of men on earth
after that evening Eagerly watched
Hygelacs kinsman his cursed foe
how he would fare in fell attack
Not that the monster was minded to pause
Straightway he seized a sleeping warrior
for the first and tore him fiercely asunder
the boneframe bit drank blood in streams
swallowed him piecemeal swiftly thus
the lifeless corse was clear devoured
een feet and hands Then farther he hied
for the hardy hero with hand he grasped
felt for the foe with fiendish claw
for the hero reclining  who clutched it boldly
prompt to answer propped on his arm
Soon then saw that shepherdofevils
that never he met in this middleworld
in the ways of earth another wight
with heavier handgripe at heart he feared
sorrowed in soul  none the sooner escaped
Fain would he flee his fastness seek
the den of devils no doings now
such as oft he had done in days of old
Then bethought him the hardy Hygelacthane
of his boast at evening up he bounded
grasped firm his foe whose fingers cracked
The fiend made off but the earl close followed
The monster meant  if he might at all 
to fling himself free and far away
fly to the fens  knew his fingers power
in the gripe of the grim one Gruesome march
to Heorot this monster of harm had made
Din filled the room the Danes were bereft
castledwellers and clansmen all
earls of their ale Angry were both
those savage hallguards the house resounded
Wonder it was the winehall firm
in the strain of their struggle stood to earth
the fair house fell not too fast it was
within and without by its iron bands
craftily clamped though there crashed from sill
many a meadbench  men have told me 
gay with gold where the grim foes wrestled
So well had weened the wisest Scyldings
that not ever at all might any man
that bonedecked brave house break asunder
crush by craft  unless clasp of fire
in smoke engulfed it  Again uprose
din redoubled Danes of the North
with fear and frenzy were filled each one
who from the wall that wailing heard
Gods foe sounding his grisly song
cry of the conquered clamorous pain
from captive of hell Too closely held him
he who of men in might was strongest
in that same day of this our life



XII

NOT in any wise would the earlsdefence 12a
suffer that slaughterous stranger to live
useless deeming his days and years
to men on earth Now many an earl
of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral
fain the life of their lord to shield
their praised prince if power were theirs
never they knew  as they neared the foe
hardyhearted heroes of war
aiming their swords on every side
the accursed to kill  no keenest blade
no farest of falchions fashioned on earth
could harm or hurt that hideous fiend
He was safe by his spells from sword of battle
from edge of iron Yet his end and parting
on that same day of this our life
woful should be and his wandering soul
far off flit to the fiends domain
Soon he found who in former days
harmful in heart and hated of God
on many a man such murder wrought
that the frame of his body failed him now
For him the keensouled kinsman of Hygelac
held in hand hateful alive
was each to other The outlaw dire
took mortal hurt a mighty wound
showed on his shoulder and sinews cracked
and the boneframe burst To Beowulf now
the glory was given and Grendel thence
deathsick his den in the dark moor sought
noisome abode he knew too well
that here was the last of life an end
of his days on earth  To all the Danes
by that bloody battle the boon had come
From ravage had rescued the roving stranger
Hrothgars hall the hardy and wise one
had purged it anew His nightwork pleased him
his deed and its honor To Eastern Danes
had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good
all their sorrow and ills assuaged
their bale of battle borne so long
and all the dole they erst endured
pain aplenty  Twas proof of this
when the hardyinfight a hand laid down
arm and shoulder  all indeed
of Grendels gripe  neath the gabled roof



XIII

MANY at morning as men have told me
warriors gathered the gifthall round
folkleaders faring from far and near
oer widestretched ways the wonder to view
trace of the traitor Not troublous seemed
the enemys end to any man
who saw by the gait of the graceless foe
how the wearyhearted away from thence
baffled in battle and banned his steps
deathmarked dragged to the devils mere
Bloody the billows were boiling there
turbid the tide of tumbling waves
horribly seething with swordblood hot
by that doomed one dyed who in den of the moor
laid forlorn his life adown
his heathen soul and hell received it
Home then rode the hoary clansmen
from that merry journey and many a youth
on horses white the hardy warriors
back from the mere Then Beowulfs glory
eager they echoed and all averred
that from sea to sea or south or north
there was no other in earths domain
under vault of heaven more valiant found
of warriors none more worthy to rule
On their lord beloved they laid no slight
gracious Hrothgar a good king he
From time to time the triedinbattle
their gray steeds set to gallop amain
and ran a race when the road seemed fair
From time to time a thane of the king
who had made many vaunts and was mindful of verses
stored with sagas and songs of old
bound word to word in wellknit rime
welded his lay this warrior soon
of Beowulfs quest right cleverly sang
and artfully added an excellent tale
in wellranged words of the warlike deeds
he had heard in saga of Sigemund
Strange the story he said it all 
the Waelsings wanderings wide his struggles
which never were told to tribes of men
the feuds and the frauds save to Fitela only
when of these doings he deigned to speak
uncle to nephew as ever the twain
stood side by side in stress of war
and multitude of the monster kind
they had felled with their swords Of Sigemund grew
when he passed from life no little praise
for the doughtyincombat a dragon killed
that herded the hoard 13a under hoary rock
the atheling dared the deed alone
fearful quest nor was Fitela there
Yet so it befell his falchion pierced
that wondrous worm  on the wall it struck
best blade the dragon died in its blood
Thus had the dreadone by daring achieved
over the ringhoard to rule at will
himself to pleasure a seaboat he loaded
and bore on its bosom the beaming gold
son of Waels the worm was consumed
He had of all heroes the highest renown
among races of men this refugeofwarriors
for deeds of daring that decked his name
since the hand and heart of Heremod
grew slack in battle He swiftly banished
to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes
to death was betrayed for torrents of sorrow
had lamed him too long a load of care
to earls and athelings all he proved
Oft indeed in earlier days
for the warriors wayfaring wise men mourned
who had hoped of him help from harm and bale
and had thought their sovrans son would thrive
follow his father his folk protect
the hoard and the stronghold heroes land
home of Scyldings  But here thanes said
the kinsman of Hygelac kinder seemed
to all the other 13b was urged to crime
And afresh to the race 13c the fallow roads
by swift steeds measured The morning sun
was climbing higher Clansmen hastened
to the highbuilt hall those hardyminded
the wonder to witness Warden of treasure
crowned with glory the king himself
with stately band from the bridebower strode
and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens
measured the path to the meadhouse fair



XIV

HROTHGAR spake  to the hall he went
stood by the steps the steep roof saw
garnished with gold and Grendels hand 
For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler
be speedy thanks A throng of sorrows
I have borne from Grendel but God still works
wonder on wonder the WardenofGlory
It was but now that I never more
for woes that weighed on me waited help
long as I lived when laved in blood
stood swordgorestained this stateliest house 
widespread woe for wise men all
who had no hope to hinder ever
foes infernal and fiendish sprites
from havoc in hall This hero now
by the Wielders might a work has done
that not all of us erst could ever do
by wile and wisdom Lo well can she say
whoso of women this warrior bore
among sons of men if still she liveth
that the God of the ages was good to her
in the birth of her bairn Now Beowulf thee
of heroes best I shall heartily love
as mine own my son preserve thou ever
this kinship new thou shalt never lack
wealth of the world that I wield as mine
Full oft for less have I largess showered
my precious hoard on a punier man
less stout in struggle Thyself hast now
fulfilled such deeds that thy fame shall endure
through all the ages As ever he did
well may the Wielder reward thee still
Beowulf spake bairn of Ecgtheow 
This work of war most willingly
we have fought this fight and fearlessly dared
force of the foe Fain too were I
hadst thou but seen himself what time
the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall
Swiftly I thought in strongest gripe
on his bed of death to bind him down
that he in the hent of this hand of mine
should breathe his last but he broke away
Him I might not  the Maker willed not 
hinder from flight and firm enough hold
the lifedestroyer too sturdy was he
the ruthless in running For rescue however
he left behind him his hand in pledge
arm and shoulder nor aught of help
could the cursed one thus procure at all
None the longer liveth he loathsome fiend
sunk in his sins but sorrow holds him
tightly grasped in gripe of anguish
in baleful bonds where bide he must
evil outlaw such awful doom
as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out

More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf 14a
in boastful speech of his battledeeds
since athelings all through the earls great prowess
beheld that hand on the high roof gazing
foemans fingers  the forepart of each
of the sturdy nails to steel was likest 
heathens handspear hostile warriors
claw uncanny Twas clear they said
that him no blade of the brave could touch
how keen soever or cut away
that battlehand bloody from baneful foe



XV

THERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now
for hands to bedeck it and dense was the throng
of men and women the winehall to cleanse
the guestroom to garnish Goldgay shone the hangings
that were wove on the wall and wonders many
to delight each mortal that looks upon them
Though braced within by iron bands
that building bright was broken sorely 15a
rent were its hinges the roof alone
held safe and sound when seared with crime
the fiendish foe his flight essayed
of life despairing  No light thing that
the flight for safety  essay it who will
Forced of fate he shall find his way
to the refuge ready for race of man
for soulpossessors and sons of earth
and there his body on bed of death
shall rest after revel
Arrived was the hour
when to hall proceeded Healfdenes son
the king himself would sit to banquet
Neer heard I of host in haughtier throng
more graciously gathered round giverofrings
Bowed then to bench those bearersofglory
fain of the feasting Featly received
many a meadcup the mightyinspirit
kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall
Hrothgar and Hrothulf Heorot now
was filled with friends the folk of Scyldings
neer yet had tried the traitors deed
To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene
a goldwove banner guerdon of triumph
broidered battleflag breastplate and helmet
and a splendid sword was seen of many
borne to the brave one Beowulf took
cup in hall 15b for such costly gifts
he suffered no shame in that soldier throng
For I heard of few heroes in heartier mood
with four such gifts so fashioned with gold
on the alebench honoring others thus
Oer the roof of the helmet high a ridge
wound with wires kept ward oer the head
lest the relictoffiles 15c should fierce invade
sharp in the strife when that shielded hero
should go to grapple against his foes
Then the earlsdefence 15d on the floor 15e bade lead
coursers eight with carven headgear
adown the hall one horse was decked
with a saddle all shining and set in jewels
twas the battleseat of the best of kings
when to play of swords the son of Healfdene
was fain to fare Neer failed his valor
in the crush of combat when corpses fell
To Beowulf over them both then gave
the refugeofIngwines right and power
oer warsteeds and weapons wished him joy of them
Manfully thus the mighty prince
hoardguard for heroes that hard fight repaid
with steeds and treasures contemned by none
who is willing to say the sooth aright



XVI

AND the lord of earls to each that came
with Beowulf over the briny ways
an heirloom there at the alebench gave
precious gift and the price 16a bade pay
in gold for him whom Grendel erst
murdered  and fain of them more had killed
had not wisest God their Wyrd averted
and the mans 16b brave mood The Maker then
ruled human kind as here and now
Therefore is insight always best
and forethought of mind How much awaits him
of lief and of loath who long time here
through days of warfare this world endures

Then song and music mingled sounds
in the presence of Healfdenes headofarmies 16c
and harping was heard with the herolay
as Hrothgars singer the halljoy woke
along the meadseats making his song
of that sudden raid on the sons of Finn 16d
Healfdenes hero Hnaef the Scylding
was fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter 16e
Hildeburh needed not hold in value
her enemies honor 16f Innocent both
were the loved ones she lost at the lindenplay
bairn and brother they bowed to fate
stricken by spears twas a sorrowful woman
None doubted why the daughter of Hoc
bewailed her doom when dawning came
and under the sky she saw them lying
kinsmen murdered where most she had kenned
of the sweets of the world By war were swept too
Finns own liegemen and few were left
in the parleyingplace 16g he could ply no longer
weapon nor war could he wage on Hengest
and rescue his remnant by right of arms
from the princes thane A pact he offered
another dwelling the Danes should have
hall and highseat and half the power
should fall to them in Frisian land
and at the feegifts Folcwalds son
day by day the Danes should honor
the folk of Hengest favor with rings
even as truly with treasure and jewels
with fretted gold as his Frisian kin
he meant to honor in alehall there
Pact of peace they plighted further
on both sides firmly Finn to Hengest
with oath upon honor openly promised
that woful remnant with wisemens aid
nobly to govern so none of the guests
by word or work should warp the treaty 16h
or with malice of mind bemoan themselves
as forced to follow their feegivers slayer
lordless men as their lot ordained
Should Frisian moreover with foemans taunt
that murderous hatred to mind recall
then edge of the sword must seal his doom

Oaths were given and ancient gold
heaped from hoard  The hardy Scylding
battlethane best 16i on his balefire lay
All on the pyre were plain to see
the gory sark the gilded swinecrest
boar of hard iron and athelings many
slain by the sword at the slaughter they fell
It was Hildeburhs hest at Hnaefs own pyre
the bairn of her body on brands to lay
his bones to burn on the balefire placed
at his uncles side In sorrowful dirges
bewept them the woman great wailing ascended
Then wound up to welkin the wildest of deathfires
roared oer the hillock 16j heads all were melted
gashes burst and blood gushed out
from bites 16k of the body Balefire devoured
greediest spirit those spared not by war
out of either folk their flower was gone



XVII

THEN hastened those heroes their home to see
friendless to find the Frisian land
houses and high burg Hengest still
through the deathdyed winter dwelt with Finn
holding pact yet of home he minded
though powerless his ringdecked prow to drive
over the waters now waves rolled fierce
lashed by the winds or winter locked them
in icy fetters Then fared another
year to mens dwellings as yet they do
the sunbright skies that their season ever
duly await Far off winter was driven
fair lay earths breast and fain was the rover
the guest to depart though more gladly he pondered
on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep
and how to hasten the hot encounter
where sons of the Frisians were sure to be
So he escaped not the common doom
when Hun with Lafing the lightofbattle
best of blades his bosom pierced
its edge was famed with the Frisian earls
On fierceheart Finn there fell likewise
on himself at home the horrid sworddeath
for Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack
had sorrowing told from seaways landed
mourning their woes 17a Finns wavering spirit
bode not in breast The burg was reddened
with blood of foemen and Finn was slain
king amid clansmen the queen was taken
To their ship the Scylding warriors bore
all the chattels the chieftain owned
whatever they found in Finns domain
of gems and jewels The gentle wife
oer paths of the deep to the Danes they bore
led to her land
The lay was finished
the gleemans song Then glad rose the revel
benchjoy brightened Bearers draw
from their wondervats wine Comes Wealhtheow forth
under goldcrown goes where the good pair sit
uncle and nephew true each to the other one
kindred in amity Unferth the spokesman
at the Scylding lords feet sat men had faith in his spirit
his keenness of courage though kinsmen had found him
unsure at the swordplay The Scylding queen spoke
Quaff of this cup my king and lord
breaker of rings and blithe be thou
goldfriend of men to the Geats here speak
such words of mildness as man should use
Be glad with thy Geats of those gifts be mindful
or near or far which now thou hast

Men say to me as son thou wishest
yon hero to hold Thy Heorot purged
jewelhall brightest enjoy while thou canst
with many a largess and leave to thy kin
folk and realm when forth thou goest
to greet thy doom For gracious I deem
my Hrothulf 17b willing to hold and rule
nobly our youths if thou yield up first
prince of Scyldings thy part in the world
I ween with good he will well requite
offspring of ours when all he minds
that for him we did in his helpless days
of gift and grace to gain him honor
Then she turned to the seat where her sons wereplaced
Hrethric and Hrothmund with heroes bairns
young men together the Geat too sat there
Beowulf brave the brothers between



XVIII

A CUP she gave him with kindly greeting
and winsome words Of wounden gold
she offered to honor him armjewels twain
corselet and rings and of collars the noblest
that ever I knew the earth around
Neer heard I so mighty neath heavens dome
a hoardgem of heroes since Hama bore
to his brightbuilt burg the Brisings necklace
jewel and gem casket  Jealousy fled he
Eormenrics hate chose help eternal
Hygelac Geat grandson of Swerting
on the last of his raids this ring bore with him
under his banner the booty defending
the warspoil warding but Wyrd oerwhelmed him
what time in his daring dangers he sought
feud with Frisians Fairest of gems
he bore with him over the beakerofwaves
sovran strong under shield he died
Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks
gear of the breast and that gorgeous ring
weaker warriors won the spoil
after gripe of battle from Geatlands lord
and held the deathfield
Din rose in hall
Wealhtheow spake amid warriors and said 
This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth
Beowulf lovd these battleweeds wear
a royal treasure and richly thrive
Preserve thy strength and these striplings here
counsel in kindness requital be mine
Hast done such deeds that for days to come
thou art famed among folk both far and near
so wide as washeth the wave of Ocean
his windy walls Through the ways of life
prosper O prince I pray for thee
rich possessions To son of mine
be helpful in deed and uphold his joys
Here every earl to the other is true
mild of mood to the master loyal
Thanes are friendly the throng obedient
liegemen are revelling list and obey
Went then to her place  That was proudest of feasts
flowed wine for the warriors Wyrd they knew not
destiny dire and the doom to be seen
by many an earl when eve should come
and Hrothgar homeward hasten away
royal to rest The room was guarded
by an army of earls as erst was done
They bared the benchboards abroad they spread
beds and bolsters  One beercarouser
in danger of doom lay down in the hall 

At their heads they set their shields of war
bucklers bright on the bench were there
over each atheling easy to see
the high battlehelmet the haughty spear
the corselet of rings Twas their custom so
ever to be for battle prepared
at home or harrying which it were
even as oft as evil threatened
their sovran king  They were clansmen good



XIX

THEN sank they to sleep With sorrow one bought
his rest of the evening  as ofttime had happened
when Grendel guarded that golden hall
evil wrought till his end drew nigh
slaughter for sins Twas seen and told
how an avenger survived the fiend
as was learned afar The livelong time
after that grim fight Grendels mother
monster of women mourned her woe
She was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters
cold seacourses since Cain cut down
with edge of the sword his only brother
his fathers offspring outlawed he fled
marked with murder from mens delights
warded the wilds  There woke from him
such fatesent ghosts as Grendel who
warwolf horrid at Heorot found
a warrior watching and waiting the fray
with whom the grisly one grappled amain
But the man remembered his mighty power
the glorious gift that God had sent him
in his Makers mercy put his trust
for comfort and help so he conquered the foe
felled the fiend who fled abject
reft of joy to the realms of death
mankinds foe And his mother now
gloomy and grim would go that quest
of sorrow the death of her son to avenge
To Heorot came she where helmeted Danes
slept in the hall Too soon came back
old ills of the earls when in she burst
the mother of Grendel Less grim though that terror
een as terror of woman in war is less
might of maid than of men in arms
when hammerforged the falchion hard
sword gorestained through swine of the helm
crested with keen blade carves amain
Then was in hall the hardedge drawn
the swords on the settles 19a and shields amany
firm held in hand nor helmet minded
nor harness of mail whom that horror seized
Haste was hers she would hie afar
and save her life when the liegemen saw her
Yet a single atheling up she seized
fast and firm as she fled to the moor
He was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest
of trusty vassals betwixt the seas
whom she killed on his couch a clansman famous
in battle brave  Nor was Beowulf there
another house had been held apart
after giving of gold for the Geat renowned 
Uproar filled Heorot the hand all had viewed
bloodflecked she bore with her bale was returned
dole in the dwellings twas dire exchange
where Dane and Geat were doomed to give
the lives of loved ones Longtried king
the hoary hero at heart was sad
when he knew his noble no more lived
and dead indeed was his dearest thane
To his bower was Beowulf brought in haste
dauntless victor As daylight broke
along with his earls the atheling lord
with his clansmen came where the king abode
waiting to see if the WielderofAll
would turn this tale of trouble and woe
Strode oer floor the famedinstrife
with his handcompanions  the hall resounded 
wishing to greet the wise old king
Ingwines lord he asked if the night
had passed in peace to the princes mind



XX

HROTHGAR spake helmetofScyldings 
Ask not of pleasure Pain is renewed
to Danish folk Dead is Aeschere
of Yrmenlaf the elder brother
my sage adviser and stay in council
shouldercomrade in stress of fight
when warriors clashed and we warded our heads
hewed the helmboars hero famed
should be every earl as Aeschere was
But here in Heorot a hand hath slain him
of wandering deathsprite I wot not whither 20a
proud of the prey her path she took
fain of her fill The feud she avenged
that yesternight unyieldingly
Grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst 
seeing how long these liegemen mine
he ruined and ravaged Reft of life
in arms he fell Now another comes
keen and cruel her kin to avenge
faring far in feud of blood
so that many a thane shall think who eer
sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings
this is hardest of heartbales The hand lies low
that once was willing each wish to please
Landdwellers here 20b and liegemen mine
who house by those parts I have heard relate
that such a pair they have sometimes seen
marchstalkers mighty the moorland haunting
wandering spirits one of them seemed
so far as my folk could fairly judge
of womankind and one accursed
in mans guise trod the miserytrack
of exile though huger than human bulk
Grendel in days long gone they named him
folk of the land his father they knew not
nor any brood that was born to him
of treacherous spirits Untrod is their home
by wolfcliffs haunt they and windy headlands
fenways fearful where flows the stream
from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks
underground flood Not far is it hence
in measure of miles that the mere expands
and oer it the frostbound forest hanging
sturdily rooted shadows the wave
By night is a wonder weird to see
fire on the waters So wise lived none
of the sons of men to search those depths
Nay though the heathrover harried by dogs
the hornproud hart this holt should seek
long distance driven his dear life first
on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge
to hide his head tis no happy place
Thence the welter of waters washes up
wan to welkin when winds bestir
evil storms and air grows dusk
and the heavens weep Now is help once more
with thee alone The land thou knowst not
place of fear where thou findest out
that sinflecked being Seek if thou dare
I will reward thee for waging this fight
with ancient treasure as erst I did
with winding gold if thou winnest back



XXI

BEOWULF spake bairn of Ecgtheow
Sorrow not sage It beseems us better
friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them
Each of us all must his end abide
in the ways of the world so win who may
glory ere death When his days are told
that is the warriors worthiest doom
Rise O realmwarder Ride we anon
and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel
No harbor shall hide her  heed my promise 
enfolding of field or forested mountain
or floor of the flood let her flee where she will
But thou this day endure in patience
as I ween thou wilt thy woes each one
Leaped up the graybeard God he thanked
mighty Lord for the mans brave words
For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled
wavemaned steed The sovran wise
stately rode on his shieldarmed men
followed in force The footprints led
along the woodland widely seen
a path oer the plain where she passed and trod
the murky moor of menatarms
she bore the bravest and best one dead
him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled
On then went the athelingborn
oer stonecliffs steep and strait defiles
narrow passes and unknown ways
headlands sheer and the haunts of the Nicors
Foremost he 21a fared a few at his side
of the wiser men the ways to scan
till he found in a flash the forested hill
hanging over the hoary rock
a woful wood the waves below
were dyed in blood The Danish men
had sorrow of soul and for Scyldings all
for many a hero twas hard to bear
ill for earls when Aescheres head
they found by the flood on the foreland there
Waves were welling the warriors saw
hot with blood but the horn sang oft
battlesong bold The band sat down
and watched on the water wormlike things
seadragons strange that sounded the deep
and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness 
such as oft essay at hour of morn
on the roadofsails their ruthless quest 
and seasnakes and monsters These started away
swollen and savage that song to hear
that warhorns blast The warden of Geats
with bolt from bow then balked of life
of wavework one monster amid its heart
went the keen warshaft in water it seemed
less doughty in swimming whom death had seized
Swift on the billows with boarspears well
hooked and barbed it was hard beset
done to death and dragged on the headland
waveroamer wondrous Warriors viewed
the grisly guest
Then girt him Beowulf
in martial mail nor mourned for his life
His breastplate broad and bright of hues
woven by hand should the waters try
well could it ward the warriors body
that battle should break on his breast in vain
nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe
And the helmet white that his head protected
was destined to dare the deeps of the flood
through wavewhirl win twas wound with chains
decked with gold as in days of yore
the weaponsmith worked it wondrously
with swineforms set it that swords nowise
brandished in battle could bite that helm
Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps
which Hrothgars orator offered at need
Hrunting they named the hilted sword
of oldtime heirlooms easily first
iron was its edge all etched with poison
with battleblood hardened nor blenched it at fight
in heros hand who held it ever
on paths of peril prepared to go
to folkstead 21b of foes Not first time this
it was destined to do a daring task
For he bore not in mind the bairn of Ecglaf
sturdy and strong that speech he had made
drunk with wine now this weapon he lent
to a stouter swordsman Himself though durst not
under welter of waters wager his life
as loyal liegeman So lost he his glory
honor of earls With the other not so
who girded him now for the grim encounter



XXII

BEOWULF spake bairn of Ecgtheow 
Have mind thou honored offspring of Healfdene
goldfriend of men now I go on this quest
sovran wise what once was said
if in thy cause it came that I
should lose my life thou wouldst loyal bide
to me though fallen in fathers place
Be guardian thou to this group of my thanes
my warriorfriends if War should seize me
and the goodly gifts thou gavest me
Hrothgar beloved to Hygelac send
Geatlands king may ken by the gold
Hrethels son see when he stares at the treasure
that I got me a friend for goodness famed
and joyed while I could in my jewelbestower
And let Unferth wield this wondrous sword
earl farhonored this heirloom precious
hard of edge with Hrunting I
seek doom of glory or Death shall take me

After these words the WederGeat lord
boldly hastened biding never
answer at all the ocean floods
closed oer the hero Long while of the day
fled ere he felt the floor of the sea

Soon found the fiend who the flooddomain
swordhungry held these hundred winters
greedy and grim that some guest from above
some man was raiding her monsterrealm
She grasped out for him with grisly claws
and the warrior seized yet scathed she not
his body hale the breastplate hindered
as she strove to shatter the sark of war
the linked harness with loathsome hand
Then bore this brinewolf when bottom she touched
the lord of rings to the lair she haunted
whiles vainly he strove though his valor held
weapon to wield against wondrous monsters
that sore beset him seabeasts many
tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail
and swarmed on the stranger But soon he marked
he was now in some hall he knew not which
where water never could work him harm
nor through the roof could reach him ever
fangs of the flood Firelight he saw
beams of a blaze that brightly shone
Then the warrior was ware of that wolfofthedeep
merewife monstrous For mighty stroke
he swung his blade and the blow withheld not
Then sang on her head that seemly blade
its warsong wild But the warrior found
the lightofbattle 22a was loath to bite
to harm the heart its hard edge failed
the noble at need yet had known of old
strife hand to hand and had helmets cloven
doomed mens fightinggear First time this
for the gleaming blade that its glory fell
Firm still stood nor failed in valor
heedful of high deeds Hygelacs kinsman
flung away fretted sword featly jewelled
the angry earl on earth it lay
steeledged and stiff His strength he trusted
handgripe of might So man shall do
whenever in war he weens to earn him
lasting fame nor fears for his life
Seized then by shoulder shrank not from combat
the Geatish warprince Grendels mother
Flung then the fierce one filled with wrath
his deadly foe that she fell to ground
Swift on her part she paid him back
with grisly grasp and grappled with him
Spent with struggle stumbled the warrior
fiercest of fightingmen fell adown
On the hallguest she hurled herself hent her short sword
broad and brownedged 22b the bairn to avenge
the soleborn son  On his shoulder lay
braided breastmail barring death
withstanding entrance of edge or blade
Life would have ended for Ecgtheows son
under wide earth for that earl of Geats
had his armor of war not aided him
battlenet hard and holy God
wielded the victory wisest Maker
The Lord of Heaven allowed his cause
and easily rose the earl erect




XXIII

MID the battlegear saw he a blade triumphant
oldsword of Eotens with edge of proof
warriors heirloom weapon unmatched
 save only twas more than other men
to bandyofbattle could bear at all 
as the giants had wrought it ready and keen
Seized then its chainhilt the Scyldings chieftain
bold and battlegrim brandished the sword
reckless of life and so wrathfully smote
that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard
her bonerings breaking the blade pierced through
that fatedones flesh to floor she sank
Bloody the blade he was blithe of his deed
Then blazed forth light Twas bright within
as when from the sky there shines unclouded
heavens candle The hall he scanned
By the wall then went he his weapon raised
high by its hilts the Hygelacthane
angry and eager That edge was not useless
to the warrior now He wished with speed
Grendel to guerdon for grim raids many
for the war he waged on WesternDanes
oftener far than an only time
when of Hrothgars hearthcompanions
he slew in slumber in sleep devoured
fifteen men of the folk of Danes
and as many others outward bore
his horrible prey Well paid for that
the wrathful prince For now prone he saw
Grendel stretched there spent with war
spoiled of life so scathed had left him
Heorots battle The body sprang far
when after death it endured the blow
swordstroke savage that severed its head
Soon 23a then saw the sage companions
who waited with Hrothgar watching the flood
that the tossing waters turbid grew
bloodstained the mere Old men together
hoaryhaired of the hero spake
the warrior would not they weened again
proud of conquest come to seek
their mighty master To many it seemed
the wolfofthewaves had won his life
The ninth hour came The noble Scyldings
left the headland homeward went
the goldfriend of men 23b But the guests sat on
stared at the surges sick in heart
and wished yet weened not their winsome lord
again to see

Now that sword began
from blood of the fight in battledroppings 23c
warblade to wane twas a wondrous thing
that all of it melted as ice is wont
when frosty fetters the Father loosens
unwinds the wavebonds wielding all
seasons and times the true God he
Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats
save only the head and that hilt withal
blazoned with jewels the blade had melted
burned was the bright sword her blood was so hot
so poisoned the hellsprite who perished within there
Soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat
downfall of demons updove through the flood
The clashing waters were cleansed now
waste of waves where the wandering fiend
her lifedays left and this lapsing world
Swam then to strand the sailorsrefuge
sturdyinspirit of seabooty glad
of burden brave he bore with him
Went then to greet him and God they thanked
the thaneband choice of their chieftain blithe
that safe and sound they could see him again
Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor
deftly they doffed now drowsed the mere
water neath welkin with warblood stained
Forth they fared by the footpaths thence
merry at heart the highways measured
wellknown roads Courageous men
carried the head from the cliff by the sea
an arduous task for all the band
the firm in fight since four were needed
on the shaftofslaughter 23d strenuously
to bear to the goldhall Grendels head
So presently to the palace there
foemen fearless fourteen Geats
marching came Their masterofclan
mighty amid them the meadowways trod
Strode then within the sovran thane
fearless in fight of fame renowned
hardy hero Hrothgar to greet
And next by the hair into hall was borne
Grendels head where the henchmen were drinking
an awe to clan and queen alike
a monster of marvel the men looked on



XXIV

BEOWULF spake bairn of Ecgtheow 
Lo now this seabooty son of Healfdene
Lord of Scyldings weve lustily brought thee
sign of glory thou seest it here
Not lightly did I with my life escape
In war under water this work I essayed
with endless effort and even so
my strength had been lost had the Lord not shielded me
Not a whit could I with Hrunting do
in work of war though the weapon is good
yet a sword the Sovran of Men vouchsafed me
to spy on the wall there in splendor hanging
old gigantic  how oft He guides
the friendless wight  and I fought with that brand
felling in fight since fate was with me
the houses wardens That warsword then
all burned bright blade when the blood gushed oer it
battlesweat hot but the hilt I brought back
from my foes So avenged I their fiendish deeds
deathfall of Danes as was due and right
And this is my hest that in Heorot now
safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band
and every thane of all thy folk
both old and young no evil fear
Scyldings lord from that side again
aught ill for thy earls as erst thou must
Then the golden hilt for that grayhaired leader
hoary hero in hand was laid
giantwrought old So owned and enjoyed it
after downfall of devils the Danish lord
wondersmiths work since the world was rid
of that grimsouled fiend the foe of God
murdermarked and his mother as well
Now it passed into power of the peoples king
best of all that the oceans bound
who have scattered their gold oer Scandias isle
Hrothgar spake  the hilt he viewed
heirloom old where was etched the rise
of that faroff fight when the floods oerwhelmed
raging waves the race of giants
fearful their fate a folk estranged
from God Eternal whence guerdon due
in that waste of waters the Wielder paid them
So on the guard of shining gold
in runic staves it was rightly said
for whom the serpenttraced sword was wrought
best of blades in bygone days
and the hilt well wound  The wiseone spake
son of Healfdene silent were all 
Lo so may he say who sooth and right
follows mid folk of far times mindful
a landwarden old 24a that this earl belongs
to the better breed So borne aloft
thy fame must fly O friend my Beowulf
far and wide oer folksteads many Firmly thou
shalt all maintain
mighty strength with mood of wisdom Love of
mine will I assure thee
as awhile ago I promised thou shalt prove a stay
in future
in faroff years to folk of thine
to the heroes a help Was not Heremod thus
to offspring of Ecgwela HonorScyldings
nor grew for their grace but for grisly slaughter
for doom of death to the Danishmen

He slew wrathswollen his shouldercomrades
companions at board So he passed alone
chieftain haughty from human cheer
Though him the Maker with might endowed
delights of power and uplifted high
above all men yet bloodfierce his mind
his breasthoard grew no bracelets gave he
to Danes as was due he endured all joyless
strain of struggle and stress of woe
long feud with his folk Here find thy lesson
Of virtue advise thee This verse I have said for thee
wise from lapsed winters Wondrous seems
how to sons of men Almighty God
in the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom
estate high station He swayeth all things
Whiles He letteth right lustily fare
the heart of the hero of highborn race 
in seat ancestral assigns him bliss
his folks sure fortress in fee to hold
puts in his power great parts of the earth
empire so ample that end of it
this wanterofwisdom weeneth none
So he waxes in wealth nowise can harm him
illness or age no evil cares
shadow his spirit no swordhate threatens
from ever an enemy all the world
wends at his will no worse he knoweth
till all within him obstinate pride
waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers
the spirits sentry sleep is too fast
which masters his might and the murderer nears
stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow



XXV

UNDER harness his heart then is hit indeed
by sharpest shafts and no shelter avails
from foul behest of the hellish fiend 25a
Him seems too little what long he possessed
Greedy and grim no golden rings
he gives for his pride the promised future
forgets he and spurns with all God has sent him
WonderWielder of wealth and fame
Yet in the end it ever comes
that the frame of the body fragile yields
fated falls and there follows another
who joyously the jewels divides
the royal riches nor recks of his forebear
Ban then such baleful thoughts Beowulf dearest
best of men and the better part choose
profit eternal and temper thy pride
warrior famous The flower of thy might
lasts now a while but erelong it shall be
that sickness or sword thy strength shall minish
or fang of fire or flooding billow
or bite of blade or brandished spear
or odious age or the eyes clear beam
wax dull and darken Death even thee
in haste shall oerwhelm thou hero of war
So the RingDanes these halfyears a hundred I ruled
wielded neath welkin and warded them bravely
from mightyones many oer middleearth
from spear and sword till it seemed for me
no foe could be found under fold of the sky
Lo sudden the shift To me seated secure
came grief for joy when Grendel began
to harry my home the hellish foe
for those ruthless raids unresting I suffered
heartsorrow heavy Heaven be thanked
Lord Eternal for life extended
that I on this head all hewn and bloody
after long evil with eyes may gaze
 Go to the bench now Be glad at banquet
warrior worthy A wealth of treasure
at dawn of day be dealt between us
Glad was the Geats lord going betimes
to seek his seat as the Sage commanded
Afresh as before for the famedinbattle
for the band of the hall was a banquet dight
nobly anew The NightHelm darkened
dusk oer the drinkers
The doughty ones rose
for the hoaryheaded would hasten to rest
aged Scylding and eager the Geat
shieldfighter sturdy for sleeping yearned
Him wanderweary warriorguest
from far a hallthane heralded forth
who by custom courtly cared for all
needs of a thane as in those old days
warriorwanderers wont to have
So slumbered the stoutheart Stately the hall
rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on
till a raven black the raptureofheaven 25b
blitheheart boded Bright came flying
shine after shadow The swordsmen hastened
athelings all were eager homeward
forth to fare and far from thence
the greathearted guest would guide his keel
Bade then the hardyone Hrunting be brought
to the son of Ecglaf the sword bade him take
excellent iron and uttered his thanks for it
quoth that he counted it keen in battle
warfriend winsome with words he slandered not
edge of the blade twas a bighearted man
Now eager for parting and armed at point
warriors waited while went to his host
that Darling of Danes The doughty atheling
to highseat hastened and Hrothgar greeted



XXVI

BEOWULF spake bairn of Ecgtheow 
Lo we seafarers say our will
farcome men that we fain would seek
Hygelac now We here have found
hosts to our heart thou hast harbored us well
If ever on earth I am able to win me
more of thy love O lord of men
aught anew than I now have done
for work of war I am willing still
If it come to me ever across the seas
that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee 
as they that hate thee erewhile have used 
thousands then of thanes I shall bring
heroes to help thee Of Hygelac I know
ward of his folk that though few his years
the lord of the Geats will give me aid
by word and by work that well I may serve thee
wielding the warwood to win thy triumph
and lending thee might when thou lackest men
If thy Hrethric should come to court of Geats
a sovrans son he will surely there
find his friends A faroff land
each man should visit who vaunts him brave
Him then answering Hrothgar spake 
These words of thine the wisest God
sent to thy soul No sager counsel
from so young in years eer yet have I heard
Thou art strong of main and in mind art wary
art wise in words I ween indeed
if ever it hap that Hrethels heir
by spear be seized by swordgrim battle
by illness or iron thine elder and lord
peoples leader  and life be thine 
no seemlier man will the SeaGeats find
at all to choose for their chief and king
for hoardguard of heroes if hold thou wilt
thy kinsmans kingdom Thy keen mind pleases me
the longer the better Beowulf loved

Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples
sons of the Geat and SpearDane folk
shall have mutual peace and from murderous strife
such as once they waged from war refrain
Long as I rule this realm so wide
let our hoards be common let heroes with gold
each other greet oer the gannetsbath
and the ringedprow bear oer rolling waves
tokens of love I trow my landfolk
towards friend and foe are firmly joined
and honor they keep in the olden way
To him in the hall then Healfdenes son
gave treasures twelve and the trustofearls
bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved
hale to his home and in haste return
Then kissed the king of kin renowned
Scyldings chieftain that choicest thane
and fell on his neck Fast flowed the tears
of the hoaryheaded Heavy with winters
he had chances twain but he clung to this 26a 
that each should look on the other again
and hear him in hall Was this hero so dear to him
his breasts wild billows he banned in vain
safe in his soul a secret longing
locked in his mind for that loved man
burned in his blood Then Beowulf strode
glad of his goldgifts the grassplot oer
warrior blithe The waveroamer bode
riding at anchor its owner awaiting
As they hastened onward Hrothgars gift
they lauded at length  Twas a lord unpeered
every way blameless till age had broken
 it spareth no mortal  his splendid might



XXVII

CAME now to ocean the evercourageous
hardy henchmen their harness bearing
woven warsarks The warden marked
trusty as ever the earls return
From the height of the hill no hostile words
reached the guests as he rode to greet them
but Welcome he called to that Weder clan
as the sheenmailed spoilers to ship marched on
Then on the strand with steeds and treasure
and armor their roomy and ringdight ship
was heavily laden high its mast
rose over Hrothgars hoarded gems
A sword to the boatguard Beowulf gave
mounted with gold on the meadbench since
he was better esteemed that blade possessing
heirloom old  Their oceankeel boarding
they drove through the deep and Daneland left
A seacloth was set a sail with ropes
firm to the mast the floodtimbers moaned 27a
nor did wind over billows that waveswimmer blow
across from her course The craft sped on
foamnecked it floated forth oer the waves
keel firmbound over briny currents
till they got them sight of the Geatish cliffs
homeknown headlands High the boat
stirred by winds on the strand updrove
Helpful at haven the harborguard stood
who long already for loved companions
by the water had waited and watched afar
He bound to the beach the broadbosomed ship
with anchorbands lest oceanbillows
that trusty timber should tear away
Then Beowulf bade them bear the treasure
gold and jewels no journey far
was it thence to go to the giver of rings
Hygelac Hrethling at home he dwelt
by the seawall close himself and clan
Haughty that house a hero the king
high the hall and Hygd 27b right young
wise and wary though winters few
in those fortress walls she had found a home
Haereths daughter Nor humble her ways
nor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men
of precious treasure Not Thryths pride showed she
folkqueen famed or that fell deceit
Was none so daring that durst make bold
save her lord alone of the liegemen dear
that lady full in the face to look
but forged fetters he found his lot
bonds of death And brief the respite
soon as they seized him his sworddoom was spoken
and the burnished blade a baleful murder
proclaimed and closed No queenly way
for woman to practise though peerless she
that the weaverofpeace 27c from warrior dear
by wrath and lying his life should reave
But Hemmings kinsman hindered this 
For over their ale men also told
that of these folkhorrors fewer she wrought
onslaughts of evil after she went
golddecked bride to the brave young prince
atheling haughty and Offas hall
oer the fallow flood at her fathers bidding
safely sought where since she prospered
royal throned rich in goods
fain of the fair life fate had sent her
and leal in love to the lord of warriors
He of all heroes I heard of ever
from sea to sea of the sons of earth
most excellent seemed Hence Offa was praised
for his fighting and feeing by faroff men
the spearbold warrior wisely he ruled
over his empire Eomer woke to him
help of heroes Hemmings kinsman
Grandson of Garmund grim in war



XXVIII

HASTENED the hardy one henchmen with him
sandy strand of the sea to tread
and widespread ways The worlds great candle
sun shone from south They strode along
with sturdy steps to the spot they knew
where the battleking young his burg within
slayer of Ongentheow shared the rings
shelterofheroes To Hygelac
Beowulfs coming was quickly told 
that there in the court the clansmens refuge
the shieldcompanion sound and alive
hale from the heroplay homeward strode
With haste in the hall by highest order
room for the rovers was readily made
By his sovran he sat come safe from battle
kinsman by kinsman His kindly lord
he first had greeted in gracious form
with manly words The mead dispensing
came through the high hall Haereths daughter
winsome to warriors winecup bore
to the hands of the heroes Hygelac then
his comrade fairly with question plied
in the lofty hall sore longing to know
what manner of sojourn the SeaGeats made
What came of thy quest my kinsman Beowulf
when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder
battle to seek oer the briny sea
combat in Heorot Hrothgar couldst thou
aid at all the honored chief
in his wideknown woes With waves of care
my sad heart seethed I sore mistrusted
my loved ones venture long I begged thee
by no means to seek that slaughtering monster
but suffer the SouthDanes to settle their feud
themselves with Grendel Now God be thanked
that safe and sound I can see thee now
Beowulf spake the bairn of Ecgtheow 
Tis known and unhidden Hygelac Lord
to many men that meeting of ours
struggle grim between Grendel and me
which we fought on the field where full too many
sorrows he wrought for the ScyldingVictors
evils unending These all I avenged
No boast can be from breed of Grendel
any on earth for that uproar at dawn
from the longestlived of the loathsome race
in fleshly fold  But first I went
Hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts
where Healfdenes kinsman highrenowned
soon as my purpose was plain to him
assigned me a seat by his son and heir
The liegemen were lusty my lifedays never
such merry men over mead in hall
have I heard under heaven The highborn queen
peoples peacebringer passed through the hall
cheered the young clansmen clasps of gold
ere she sought her seat to sundry gave
Oft to the heroes Hrothgars daughter
to earls in turn the alecup tendered 
she whom I heard these hallcompanions
Freawaru name when fretted gold
she proffered the warriors Promised is she
golddecked maid to the glad son of Froda
Sage this seems to the Scyldingsfriend
kingdomskeeper he counts it wise
the woman to wed so and ward off feud
store of slaughter But seldom ever
when men are slain does the murderspear sink
but briefest while though the bride be fair 28a
Nor haply will like it the Heathobard lord
and as little each of his liegemen all
when a thane of the Danes in that doughty throng
goes with the lady along their hall
and on him the oldtime heirlooms glisten
hard and ringdecked Heathobards treasure
weapons that once they wielded fair
until they lost at the lindenplay 28b
liegeman leal and their lives as well
Then over the ale on this heirloom gazing
some ashwielder old who has all in mind
that speardeath of men 28c  he is stern of mood
heavy at heart  in the hero young
tests the temper and tries the soul
and warhate wakens with words like these 
Canst thou not comrade ken that sword
which to the fray thy father carried
in his final feud neath the fightingmask
dearest of blades when the Danish slew him
and wielded the warplace on Withergilds fall
after havoc of heroes those hardy Scyldings
Now the son of a certain slaughtering Dane
proud of his treasure paces this hall
joys in the killing and carries the jewel 28d
that rightfully ought to be owned by thee_
Thus he urges and eggs him all the time
with keenest words till occasion offers
that Freawarus thane for his fathers deed
after bite of brand in his blood must slumber
losing his life but that liegeman flies
living away for the land he kens
And thus be broken on both their sides
oaths of the earls when Ingelds breast
wells with warhate and wifelove now
after the carebillows cooler grows
So 28e I hold not high the Heathobards faith
due to the Danes or their during love
and pact of peace  But I pass from that
turning to Grendel O giveroftreasure
and saying in full how the fight resulted
handfray of heroes When heavens jewel
had fled oer far fields that fierce sprite came
nightfoe savage to seek us out
where safe and sound we sentried the hall
To Hondscio then was that harassing deadly
his fall there was fated He first was slain
girded warrior Grendel on him
turned murderous mouth on our mighty kinsman
and all of the brave mans body devoured
Yet none the earlier emptyhanded
would the bloodytoothed murderer mindful of bale
outward go from the golddecked hall
but me he attacked in his terror of might
with greedy hand grasped me A glove hung by him 28f
wide and wondrous wound with bands
and in artful wise it all was wrought
by devilish craft of dragonskins
Me therein an innocent man
the fiendish foe was fain to thrust
with many another He might not so
when I all angrily upright stood
Twere long to relate how that landdestroyer
I paid in kind for his cruel deeds
yet there my prince this people of thine
got fame by my fighting He fled away
and a little space his life preserved
but there staid behind him his stronger hand
left in Heorot heartsick thence
on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell
Me for this struggle the Scyldingsfriend
paid in plenty with plates of gold
with many a treasure when morn had come
and we all at the banquetboard sat down
Then was song and glee The grayhaired Scylding
much tested told of the times of yore
Whiles the hero his harp bestirred
woodofdelight now lays he chanted
of sooth and sadness or said aright
legends of wonder the widehearted king
or for years of his youth he would yearn at times
for strength of old struggles now stricken with age
hoary hero his heart surged full
when wise with winters he wailed their flight
Thus in the hall the whole of that day
at ease we feasted till fell oer earth
another night Anon full ready
in greed of vengeance Grendels mother
set forth all doleful Dead was her son
through warhate of Weders now woman monstrous
with fury fell a foeman she slew
avenged her offspring From Aeschere old
loyal councillor life was gone
nor might they een when morning broke
those Danish people their deathdone comrade
burn with brands on balefire lay
the man they mourned Under mountain stream
she had carried the corpse with cruel hands
For Hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow
of all that had laden the lord of his folk
The leader then by thy life besought me
sad was his soul in the seawaves coil
to play the hero and hazard my being
for glory of prowess my guerdon he pledged
I then in the waters  tis widely known 
that seafloorguardian savage found
Handtohand there a while we struggled
billows welled blood in the briny hall
her head I hewed with a hardy blade
from Grendels mother  and gained my life
though not without danger My doom was not yet
Then the havenofheroes Healfdenes son
gave me in guerdon great gifts of price



XXIX

So held this king to the customs old
that I wanted for nought in the wage I gained
the meed of my might he made me gifts
Healfdenes heir for my own disposal
Now to thee my prince I proffer them all
gladly give them Thy grace alone
can find me favor Few indeed
have I of kinsmen save Hygelac thee
Then he bade them bear him the boarhead standard
the battlehelm high and breastplate gray
the splendid sword then spake in form 
Me this wargear the wise old prince
Hrothgar gave and his hest he added
that its story be straightway said to thee 
A while it was held by Heorogar king
for long time lord of the land of Scyldings
yet not to his son the sovran left it
to daring Heoroweard  dear as he was to him
his harness of battle  Well hold thou it all
And I heard that soon passed oer the path of this treasure
all applefallow four good steeds
each like the others arms and horses
he gave to the king So should kinsmen be
not weave one another the net of wiles
or with deephid treachery death contrive
for neighbor and comrade His nephew was ever
by hardy Hygelac held full dear
and each kept watch oer the others weal
I heard too the necklace to Hygd he presented
wonderwrought treasure which Wealhtheow gave him
sovrans daughter three steeds he added
slender and saddlegay Since such gift
the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen
Thus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow
as a man remarked for mighty deeds
and acts of honor At ale he slew not
comrade or kin nor cruel his mood
though of sons of earth his strength was greatest
a glorious gift that God had sent
the splendid leader Long was he spurned
and worthless by Geatish warriors held
him at mead the masterofclans
failed full oft to favor at all
Slack and shiftless the strong men deemed him
profitless prince but payment came
to the warrior honored for all his woes 
Then the bulwarkofearls 29a bade bring within
hardy chieftain Hrethels heirloom
garnished with gold no Geat eer knew
in shape of a sword a statelier prize
The brand he laid in Beowulfs lap
and of hides assigned him seven thousand 29b
with house and highseat They held in common
land alike by their line of birth
inheritance home but higher the king
because of his rule oer the realm itself

Now further it fell with the flight of years
with harryings horrid that Hygelac perished 29c
and Heardred too by hewing of swords
under the shieldwall slaughtered lay
when him at the van of his victorfolk
sought hardy heroes HeathoScilfings
in arms oerwhelming Hererics nephew
Then Beowulf came as king this broad
realm to wield and he ruled it well
fifty winters 29d a wise old prince
warding his land until One began
in the dark of night a Dragon to rage
In the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded
in the stonebarrow steep A strait path reached it
unknown to mortals Some man however
came by chance that cave within
to the heathen hoard 29e In hand he took
a golden goblet nor gave he it back
stole with it away while the watcher slept
by thievish wiles for the wardens wrath
prince and people must pay betimes



XXX

THAT way he went with no will of his own
in danger of life to the dragons hoard
but for pressure of peril some princes thane
He fled in fear the fatal scourge
seeking shelter a sinful man
and entered in At the awful sight
tottered that guest and terror seized him
yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon
from fright and fear ere he fled away
and took the cup from that treasurehoard
Of such besides there was store enough
heirlooms old the earth below
which some earl forgotten in ancient years
left the last of his lofty race
heedfully there had hidden away
dearest treasure For death of yore
had hurried all hence and he alone
left to live the last of the clan
weeping his friends yet wished to bide
warding the treasure his one delight
though brief his respite The barrow newready
to strand and seawaves stood anear
hard by the headland hidden and closed
there laid within it his lordly heirlooms
and heaped hoard of heavy gold
that warden of rings Few words he spake
Now hold thou earth since heroes may not
what earls have owned Lo erst from thee
brave men brought it But battledeath seized
and cruel killing my clansmen all
robbed them of life and a liegemans joys
None have I left to lift the sword
or to cleanse the carven cup of price
beaker bright My brave are gone
And the helmet hard all haughty with gold
shall part from its plating Polishers sleep
who could brighten and burnish the battlemask
and those weeds of war that were wont to brave
over bicker of shields the bite of steel
rust with their bearer The ringed mail
fares not far with famous chieftain
at side of hero No harps delight
no gleewoods gladness No good hawk now
flies through the hall Nor horses fleet
stamp in the burgstead Battle and death
the flower of my race have reft away
Mournful of mood thus he moaned his woe
alone for them all and unblithe wept
by day and by night till deaths fell wave
oerwhelmed his heart His hoardofbliss
that old illdoer open found
who blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth
naked foedragon flying by night
folded in fire the folk of earth
dread him sore Tis his doom to seek
hoard in the graves and heathen gold
to watch manywintered nor wins he thereby
Powerful this plagueofthepeople thus
held the house of the hoard in earth
three hundred winters till One aroused
wrath in his breast to the ruler bearing
that costly cup and the king implored
for bond of peace So the barrow was plundered
borne off was booty His boon was granted
that wretched man and his ruler saw
first time what was fashioned in faroff days
When the dragon awoke new woe was kindled
Oer the stone he snuffed The starkheart found
footprint of foe who so far had gone
in his hidden craft by the creatures head 
So may the undoomed easily flee
evils and exile if only he gain
the grace of The Wielder  That warden of gold
oer the ground went seeking greedy to find
the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep
Savage and burning the barrow he circled
all without nor was any there
none in the waste Yet war he desired
was eager for battle The barrow he entered
sought the cup and discovered soon
that some one of mortals had searched his treasure
his lordly gold The guardian waited
illenduring till evening came
boiling with wrath was the barrows keeper
and fain with flame the foe to pay
for the dear cups loss  Now day was fled
as the worm had wished By its wall no more
was it glad to bide but burning flew
folded in flame a fearful beginning
for sons of the soil and soon it came
in the doom of their lord to a dreadful end



XXXI

THEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out
and bright homes burned The blaze stood high
all landsfolk frighting No living thing
would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew
Wide was the dragons warring seen
its fiendish fury far and near
as the grim destroyer those Geatish people
hated and hounded To hidden lair
to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn
Folk of the land it had lapped in flame
with bale and brand In its barrow it trusted
its battling and bulwarks that boast was vain

To Beowulf then the bale was told
quickly and truly the kings own home
of buildings the best in brandwaves melted
that giftthrone of Geats To the good old man
sad in heart twas heaviest sorrow
The sage assumed that his sovran God
he had angered breaking ancient law
and embittered the Lord His breast within
with black thoughts welled as his wont was never
The folks own fastness that fiery dragon
with flame had destroyed and the stronghold all
washed by waves but the warlike king
prince of the Weders plotted vengeance
Warriorsbulwark he bade them work
all of iron  the earls commander 
a warshield wondrous well he knew
that forestwood against fire were worthless
linden could aid not  Atheling brave
he was fated to finish this fleeting life 31a
his days on earth and the dragon with him
though long it had watched oer the wealth of the hoard 
Shame he reckoned it sharerofrings
to follow the flyerafar with a host
a broadflung band nor the battle feared he
nor deemed he dreadful the dragons warring
its vigor and valor ventures desperate
he had passed aplenty and perils of war
contestcrash since conqueror proud
Hrothgars hall he had wholly purged
and in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel
loathsome breed Not least was that
of handtohand fights where Hygelac fell
when the ruler of Geats in rush of battle
lord of his folk in the Frisian land
son of Hrethel by sworddraughts died
by brands downbeaten Thence Beowulf fled
through strength of himself and his swimming power
though alone and his arms were laden with thirty
coats of mail when he came to the sea
Nor yet might Hetwaras 31b haughtily boast
their craft of contest who carried against him
shields to the fight but few escaped
from strife with the hero to seek their homes
Then swam over ocean Ecgtheows son
lonely and sorrowful seeking his land
where Hygd made him offer of hoard and realm
rings and royalseat reckoning naught
the strength of her son to save their kingdom
from hostile hordes after Hygelacs death
No sooner for this could the stricken ones
in any wise move that athelings mind
over young Heardreds head as lord
and ruler of all the realm to be
yet the hero upheld him with helpful words
aided in honor till older grown
he wielded the WederGeats  Wandering exiles
sought him oer seas the sons of Ohtere
who had spurned the sway of the Scylfingshelmet
the bravest and best that broke the rings
in Swedish land of the seakings line
haughty hero 31c Hence Heardreds end
For shelter he gave them sworddeath came
the blades fell blow to bairn of Hygelac
but the son of Ongentheow sought again
house and home when Heardred fell
leaving Beowulf lord of Geats
and giftseats master  A good king he

THE fall of his lord he was fain to requite
in after days and to Eadgils he proved
friend to the friendless and forces sent
over the sea to the son of Ohtere
weapons and warriors well repaid he
those carepaths cold when the king he slew 32a
Thus safe through struggles the son of Ecgtheow
had passed a plenty through perils dire
with daring deeds till this day was come
that doomed him now with the dragon to strive
With comrades eleven the lord of Geats
swollen in rage went seeking the dragon
He had heard whence all the harm arose
and the killing of clansmen that cup of price
on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder
In the throng was this one thirteenth man
starter of all the strife and ill
careladen captive cringing thence
forced and reluctant he led them on
till he came in ken of that cavernhall
the barrow delved near billowy surges
flood of ocean Within twas full
of wiregold and jewels a jealous warden
warrior trusty the treasures held
lurked in his lair Not light the task
of entrance for any of earthborn men
Sat on the headland the hero king
spake words of hail to his hearthcompanions
goldfriend of Geats All gloomy his soul
wavering deathbound Wyrd full nigh
stood ready to greet the grayhaired man
to seize his soulhoard sunder apart
life and body Not long would be
the warriors spirit enwound with flesh
Beowulf spake the bairn of Ecgtheow 
Through store of struggles I strove in youth
mighty feuds I mind them all
I was seven years old when the sovran of rings
friendofhisfolk from my father took me
had me and held me Hrethel the king
with food and fee faithful in kinship
Neer while I lived there he loathlier found me
bairn in the burg than his birthright sons
Herebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine
For the eldest of these by unmeet chance
by kinsmans deed was the deathbed strewn
when Haethcyn killed him with horny bow
his own dear liege laid low with an arrow
missed the mark and his mate shot down
one brother the other with bloody shaft
A feeless fight 32b and a fearful sin
horror to Hrethel yet hard as it was
unavenged must the atheling die
Too awful it is for an aged man
to bide and bear that his bairn so young
rides on the gallows A rime he makes
sorrowsong for his son there hanging
as rapture of ravens no rescue now
can come from the old disabled man
Still is he minded as morning breaks
of the heir gone elsewhere 32c another he hopes not
he will bide to see his burg within
as ward for his wealth now the one has found
doom of death that the deed incurred
Forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son
winehall waste and windswept chambers
reft of revel The rider sleepeth
the hero farhidden 32d no harp resounds
in the courts no wassail as once was heard



XXXIII

THEN he goes to his chamber a griefsong chants
alone for his lost Too large all seems
homestead and house So the helmetofWeders
hid in his heart for Herebeald
waves of woe No way could he take
to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul
nor een could he harass that hero at all
with loathing deed though he loved him not
And so for the sorrow his soul endured
mens gladness he gave up and Gods light chose
Lands and cities he left his sons
as the wealthy do when he went from earth
There was strife and struggle twixt Swede and Geat
oer the width of waters war arose
hard battlehorror when Hrethel died
and Ongentheows offspring grew
strifekeen bold nor brooked oer the seas
pact of peace but pushed their hosts
to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh
Men of my folk for that feud had vengeance
for woful war tis widely known
though one of them bought it with blood of his heart
a bargain hard for Haethcyn proved
fatal that fray for the firstofGeats
At morn I heard was the murderer killed
by kinsman for kinsman 33a with clash of sword
when Ongentheow met Eofor there
Wide split the warhelm wan he fell
hoary Scylfing the hand that smote him
of feud was mindful nor flinched from the deathblow
 For all that he 33b gave me my gleaming sword
repaid him at war  such power I wielded 
for lordly treasure with land he entrusted me
homestead and house He had no need
from Swedish realm or from SpearDane folk
or from men of the Gifths to get him help 
some warrior worse for wage to buy
Ever I fought in the front of all
sole to the fore and so shall I fight
while I bide in life and this blade shall last
that early and late hath loyal proved
since for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell
slain by my hand the Hugas champion
Nor fared he thence to the Frisian king
with the booty back and breastadornments
but slain in struggle that standardbearer
fell atheling brave Not with blade was he slain
but his bones were broken by brawny gripe
his heartwaves stilled  The swordedge now
hard blade and my hand for the hoard shall strive
Beowulf spake and a battlevow made
his last of all I have lived through many
wars in my youth now once again
old folkdefender feud will I seek
do doughty deeds if the dark destroyer
forth from his cavern come to fight me
Then hailed he the helmeted heroes all
for the last time greeting his liegemen dear
comrades of war I should carry no weapon
no sword to the serpent if sure I knew
how with such enemy else my vows
I could gain as I did in Grendels day
But fire in this fight I must fear me now
and poisonous breath so I bring with me
breastplate and board 33c From the barrows keeper
no footbreadth flee I One fight shall end
our war by the wall as Wyrd allots
all mankinds master My mood is bold
but forbears to boast oer this battlingflyer
 Now abide by the barrow ye breastplatemailed
ye heroes in harness which of us twain
better from battlerush bear his wounds
Wait ye the finish The fight is not yours
nor meet for any but me alone
to measure might with this monster here
and play the hero Hardily I
shall win that wealth or war shall seize
cruel killing your king and lord
Up stood then with shield the sturdy champion
stayed by the strength of his single manhood
and hardy neath helmet his harness bore
under cleft of the cliffs no cowards path
Soon spied by the wall that warrior chief
survivor of many a victoryfield
where foemen fought with furious clashings
an arch of stone and within a stream
that broke from the barrow The brooklets wave
was hot with fire The hoard that way
he never could hope unharmed to near
or endure those deeps 33d for the dragons flame
Then let from his breast for he burst with rage
the WederGeat prince a word outgo
stormed the starkheart stern went ringing
and clear his cry neath the cliffrocks gray
The hoardguard heard a human voice
his rage was enkindled No respite now
for pact of peace The poisonbreath
of that foul worm first came forth from the cave
hot reekoffight the rocks resounded
Stout by the stoneway his shield he raised
lord of the Geats against the loathedone
while with courage keen that coiled foe
came seeking strife The sturdy king
had drawn his sword not dull of edge
heirloom old and each of the two
felt fear of his foe though fierce their mood
Stoutly stood with his shield highraised
the warrior king as the worm now coiled
together amain the mailedone waited
Now spire by spire fast sped and glided
that blazing serpent The shield protected
soul and body a shorter while
for the heroking than his heart desired
could his will have wielded the welcome respite
but once in his life But Wyrd denied it
and victorys honors  His arm he lifted
lord of the Geats the grim foe smote
with athelings heirloom Its edge was turned
brown blade on the bone and bit more feebly
than its noble master had need of then
in his baleful stress  Then the barrows keeper
waxed full wild for that weighty blow
cast deadly flames wide drove and far
those vicious fires No victors glory
the Geats lord boasted his brand had failed
naked in battle as never it should
excellent iron  Twas no easy path
that Ecgtheows honored heir must tread
over the plain to the place of the foe
for against his will he must win a home
elsewhere far as must all men leaving
this lapsing life  Not long it was
ere those champions grimly closed again
The hoardguard was heartened high heaved his breast
once more and by peril was pressed again
enfolded in flames the folkcommander
Nor yet about him his band of comrades
sons of athelings armed stood
with warlike front to the woods they bent them
their lives to save But the soul of one
with care was cumbered Kinship true
can never be marred in a noble mind



XXXIV

WIGLAF his name was Weohstans son
lindenthane loved the lord of Scylfings
Aelfheres kinsman His king he now saw
with heat under helmet hard oppressed
He minded the prizes his prince had given him
wealthy seat of the Waegmunding line
and folkrights that his father owned
Not long he lingered The linden yellow
his shield he seized the old sword he drew 
as heirloom of Eanmund earthdwellers knew it
who was slain by the swordedge son of Ohtere
friendless exile erst in fray
killed by Weohstan who won for his kin
brownbright helmet breastplate ringed
old sword of Eotens Onelas gift
weeds of war of the warriorthane
battlegear brave though a brothers child
had been felled the feud was unfelt by Onela 34a
For winters this wargear Weohstan kept
breastplate and board till his bairn had grown
earlship to earn as the old sire did
then he gave him mid Geats the gear of battle
portion huge when he passed from life
fared aged forth For the first time now
with his leaderlord the liegeman young
was bidden to share the shock of battle
Neither softened his soul nor the sires bequest
weakened in war 34b So the worm found out
when once in fight the foes had met
Wiglaf spake  and his words were sage
sad in spirit he said to his comrades 
I remember the time when mead we took
what promise we made to this prince of ours
in the banquethall to our breakerofrings
for gear of combat to give him requital
for hardsword and helmet if hap should bring
stress of this sort Himself who chose us
from all his army to aid him now
urged us to glory and gave these treasures
because he counted us keen with the spear
and hardy neath helm though this herowork
our leader hoped unhelped and alone
to finish for us  folkdefender
who hath got him glory greater than all men
for daring deeds Now the day is come
that our noble master has need of the might
of warriors stout Let us stride along
the hero to help while the heat is about him
glowing and grim For God is my witness
I am far more fain the fire should seize
along with my lord these limbs of mine 34c
Unsuiting it seems our shields to bear
homeward hence save here we essay
to fell the foe and defend the life
of the Weders lord I wot twere shame
on the law of our land if alone the king
out of Geatish warriors woe endured
and sank in the struggle My sword and helmet
breastplate and board for us both shall serve
Through slaughterreek strode he to succor his chieftain
his battlehelm bore and brief words spake 
Beowulf dearest do all bravely
as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst
that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise
thy glory droop Now great in deeds
atheling steadfast with all thy strength
shield thy life I will stand to help thee
At the words the worm came once again
murderous monster mad with rage
with firebillows flaming its foes to seek
the hated men In heatwaves burned
that board 34d to the boss and the breastplate failed
to shelter at all the spearthane young
Yet quickly under his kinsmans shield
went eager the earl since his own was now
all burned by the blaze The bold king again
had mind of his glory with might his glaive
was driven into the dragons head 
blow nerved by hate But Naegling 34e was shivered
broken in battle was Beowulfs sword
old and gray Twas granted him not
that ever the edge of iron at all
could help him at strife too strong was his hand
so the tale is told and he tried too far
with strength of stroke all swords he wielded
though sturdy their steel they steaded him nought
Then for the third time thought on its feud
that folkdestroyer firedread dragon
and rushed on the hero where room allowed
battlegrim burning its bitter teeth
closed on his neck and covered him
with waves of blood from his breast that welled



XXXV

TWAS now men say in his sovrans need
that the earl made known his noble strain
craft and keenness and courage enduring
Heedless of harm though his hand was burned
hardyhearted he helped his kinsman
A little lower the loathsome beast
he smote with sword his steel drove in
bright and burnished that blaze began
to lose and lessen At last the king
wielded his wits again warknife drew
a biting blade by his breastplate hanging
and the Wedershelm smote that worm asunder
felled the foe flung forth its life
So had they killed it kinsmen both
athelings twain thus an earl should be
in dangers day  Of deeds of valor
this conquerorshour of the king was last
of his work in the world The wound began
which that dragonofearth had erst inflicted
to swell and smart and soon he found
in his breast was boiling baleful and deep
pain of poison The prince walked on
wise in his thought to the wall of rock
then sat and stared at the structure of giants
where arch of stone and steadfast column
upheld forever that hall in earth
Yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless
lave with water his winsome lord
the king and conqueror covered with blood
with struggle spent and unspan his helmet
Beowulf spake in spite of his hurt
his mortal wound full well he knew
his portion now was past and gone
of earthly bliss and all had fled
of his file of days and death was near
I would fain bestow on son of mine
this gear of war were given me now
that any heir should after me come
of my proper blood This people I ruled
fifty winters No folkking was there
none at all of the neighboring clans
who war would wage me with warriorsfriends 35a
and threat me with horrors At home I bided
what fate might come and I cared for mine own
feuds I sought not nor falsely swore
ever on oath For all these things
though fatally wounded fain am I
From the RulerofMan no wrath shall seize me
when life from my frame must flee away
for killing of kinsmen Now quickly go
and gaze on that hoard neath the hoary rock
Wiglaf loved now the worm lies low
sleeps heartsore of his spoil bereaved
And fare in haste I would fain behold
the gorgeous heirlooms golden store
have joy in the jewels and gems lay down
softlier for sight of this splendid hoard
my life and the lordship I long have held



XXXVI

I HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan
at wish and word of his wounded king 
warsick warrior  woven mailcoat
battlesark bore neath the barrows roof
Then the clansman keen of conquest proud
passing the seat 36a saw store of jewels
and glistening gold the ground along
by the wall were marvels and many a vessel
in the den of the dragon the dawnflier old
unburnished bowls of bygone men
reft of richness rusty helms
of the olden age and armrings many
wondrously woven  Such wealth of gold
booty from barrow can burden with pride
each human wight let him hide it who will 
His glance too fell on a goldwove banner
high oer the hoard of handiwork noblest
brilliantly broidered so bright its gleam
all the earthfloor he easily saw
and viewed all these vessels No vestige now
was seen of the serpent the sword had taen him
Then I heard the hill of its hoard was reft
old work of giants by one alone
he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate
at his own good will and the ensign took
brightest of beacons  The blade of his lord
 its edge was iron  had injured deep
one that guarded the golden hoard
many a year and its murderfire
spread hot round the barrow in horrorbillows
at midnight hour till it met its doom
Hasted the herald the hoard so spurred him
his track to retrace he was troubled by doubt
highsouled hero if haply hed find
alive where he left him the lord of Weders
weakening fast by the wall of the cave
So he carried the load His lord and king
he found all bleeding famous chief
at the lapse of life The liegeman again
plashed him with water till point of word
broke through the breasthoard Beowulf spake
sage and sad as he stared at the gold 
For the gold and treasure to God my thanks
to the WielderofWonders with words I say
for what I behold to Heavens Lord
for the grace that I give such gifts to my folk
or ever the day of my death be run
Now Ive bartered here for booty of treasure
the last of my life so look ye well
to the needs of my land No longer I tarry
A barrow bid ye the battlefanned raise
for my ashes Twill shine by the shore of the flood
to folk of mine memorial fair
on Hrones Headland high uplifted
that oceanwanderers oft may hail
Beowulfs Barrow as back from far
they drive their keels oer the darkling wave
From his neck he unclasped the collar of gold
valorous king to his vassal gave it
with brightgold helmet breastplate and ring
to the youthful thane bade him use them in joy
Thou art end and remnant of all our race
the Waegmunding name For Wyrd hath swept them
all my line to the land of doom
earls in their glory I after them go
This word was the last which the wise old man
harbored in heart ere hot deathwaves
of balefire he chose From his bosom fled
his soul to seek the saints reward



XXXVII

IT was heavy hap for that hero young
on his lord beloved to look and find him
lying on earth with life at end
sorrowful sight But the slayer too
awful earthdragon empty of breath
lay felled in fight nor fain of its treasure
could the writhing monster rule it more
For edges of iron had ended its days
hard and battlesharp hammers leaving 37a
and that flierafar had fallen to ground
hushed by its hurt its hoard all near
no longer lusty aloft to whirl
at midnight making its merriment seen
proud of its prizes prone it sank
by the handiwork of the heroking
Forsooth among folk but few achieve
 though sturdy and strong as stories tell me
and never so daring in deed of valor 
the perilous breath of a poisonfoe
to brave and to rush on the ringboard hall
whenever his watch the warden keeps
bold in the barrow Beowulf paid
the price of death for that precious hoard
and each of the foes had found the end
of this fleeting life
Befell erelong
that the laggards in war the wood had left
trothbreakers cowards ten together
fearing before to flourish a spear
in the sore distress of their sovran lord
Now in their shame their shields they carried
armor of fight where the old man lay
and they gazed on Wiglaf Wearied he sat
at his sovrans shoulder shieldsman good
to wake him with water 37b Nowise it availed
Though well he wished it in world no more
could he barrier life for that leaderofbattles
nor baffle the will of allwielding God
Doom of the Lord was law oer the deeds
of every man as it is today
Grim was the answer easy to get
from the youth for those that had yielded to fear
Wiglaf spake the son of Weohstan 
mournful he looked on those men unloved 
Who sooth will speak can say indeed
that the ruler who gave you golden rings
and the harness of war in which ye stand
 for he at alebench oftentimes
bestowed on hallfolk helm and breastplate
lord to liegemen the likeliest gear
which near of far he could find to give 
threw away and wasted these weeds of battle
on men who failed when the foemen came
Not at all could the king of his comradesinarms
venture to vaunt though the VictoryWielder
God gave him grace that he got revenge
sole with his sword in stress and need
To rescue his life twas little that I
could serve him in struggle yet shift I made
hopeless it seemed to help my kinsman
Its strength ever waned when with weapon I struck
that fatal foe and the fire less strongly
flowed from its head  Too few the heroes
in throe of contest that thronged to our king
Now gift of treasure and girding of sword
joy of the house and homedelight
shall fail your folk his freeholdland
every clansman within your kin
shall lose and leave when lords highborn
hear afar of that flight of yours
a fameless deed Yea death is better
for liegemen all than a life of shame



XXXVIII

THAT battletoil bade he at burg to announce
at the fort on the cliff where full of sorrow
all the morning earls had sat
daring shieldsmen in doubt of twain
would they wail as dead or welcome home
their lord beloved Little 38a kept back
of the tidings new but told them all
the herald that up the headland rode 
Now the willinggiver to Weder folk
in deathbed lies the Lord of Geats
on the slaughterbed sleeps by the serpents deed
And beside him is stretched that slayerofmen
with knifewounds sick 38b no sword availed
on the awesome thing in any wise
to work a wound There Wiglaf sitteth
Weohstans bairn by Beowulfs side
the living earl by the other dead
and heavy of heart a headwatch 38c keeps
oer friend and foe  Now our folk may look
for waging of war when once unhidden
to Frisian and Frank the fall of the king
is spread afar  The strife began
when hot on the Hugas 38d Hygelac fell
and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land
Him there the Hetwaras humbled in war
plied with such prowess their power oerwhelming
that the boldinbattle bowed beneath it
and fell in fight To his friends no wise
could that earl give treasure And ever since
the Merowings favor has failed us wholly
Nor aught expect I of peace and faith
from Swedish folk Twas spread afar
how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood
Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life
when the folk of Geats for the first time sought
in wanton pride the WarlikeScylfings
Soon the sage old sire 38e of Ohtere
ancient and awful gave answering blow
the seaking 38f he slew and his spouse redeemed
his good wife rescued though robbed of her gold
mother of Ohtere and Onela
Then he followed his foes who fled before him
sore beset and stole their way
bereft of a ruler to Ravenswood

With his host he besieged there what swords had left
the weary and wounded woes he threatened
the whole night through to that hardpressed throng
some with the morrow his sword should kill
some should go to the gallowstree
for rapture of ravens But rescue came
with dawn of day for those desperate men
when they heard the horn of Hygelac sound
tones of his trumpet the trusty king
had followed their trail with faithful band



XXXIX

THE bloody swath of Swedes and Geats
and the storm of their strife were seen afar
how folk against folk the fight had wakened
The ancient king with his atheling band
sought his citadel sorrowing much
Ongentheow earl went up to his burg
He had tested Hygelacs hardihood
the proud ones prowess would prove it no longer
defied no more those fightingwanderers
nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard
his bairn and his bride so he bent him again
old to his earthwalls Yet after him came
with slaughter for Swedes the standards of Hygelac
oer peaceful plains in pride advancing
till Hrethelings fought in the fenced town 39a
Then Ongentheow with edge of sword
the hoarybearded was held at bay
and the folkking there was forced to suffer
Eofors anger In ire at the king
Wulf Wonreding with weapon struck
and the chieftains blood for that blow in streams
flowed neath his hair No fear felt he
stout old Scylfing but straightway repaid
in better bargain that bitter stroke
and faced his foe with fell intent
Nor swift enough was the son of Wonred
answer to render the aged chief
too soon on his head the helm was cloven
bloodbedecked he bowed to earth
and fell adown not doomed was he yet
and well he waxed though the wound was sore
Then the hardy Hygelacthane 39b
when his brother fell with broad brand smote
giants sword crashing through giantshelm
across the shieldwall sank the king
his folks old herdsman fatally hurt
There were many to bind the brothers wounds
and lift him fast as fate allowed
his people to wield the placeofwar
But Eofor took from Ongentheow
earl from other the ironbreastplate
hard sword hilted and helmet too
and the hoarchiefs harness to Hygelac carried
who took the trappings and truly promised
rich fee mid folk  and fulfilled it so
For that grim strife gave the Geatish lord
Hrethels offspring when home he came
to Eofor and Wulf a wealth of treasure
Each of them had a hundred thousand 39c
in land and linked rings nor at less price reckoned
midearth men such mighty deeds
And to Eofor he gave his only daughter
in pledge of grace the pride of his home

Such is the feud the foemans rage
deathhate of men so I deem it sure
that the Swedish folk will seek us home
for this fall of their friends the fightingScylfings
when once they learn that our warrior leader
lifeless lies who land and hoard
ever defended from all his foes
furthered his folks weal finished his course
a hardy hero  Now haste is best
that we go to gaze on our Geatish lord
and bear the bountiful breakerofrings
to the funeral pyre No fragments merely
shall burn with the warrior Wealth of jewels
gold untold and gained in terror
treasure at last with his life obtained
all of that booty the brands shall take
fire shall eat it No earl must carry
memorial jewel No maiden fair
shall wreathe her neck with noble ring
nay sad in spirit and shorn of her gold
oft shall she pass oer paths of exile
now our lord all laughter has laid aside
all mirth and revel Many a spear
morningcold shall be clasped amain
lifted aloft nor shall lilt of harp
those warriors wake but the wanhued raven
fain oer the fallen his feast shall praise
and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate
when he and the wolf were wasting the slain

So he told his sorrowful tidings
and little 39d he lied the loyal man
of word or of work The warriors rose
sad they climbed to the CliffofEagles
went welling with tears the wonder to view
Found on the sand there stretched at rest
their lifeless lord who had lavished rings
of old upon them Endingday
had dawned on the doughtyone death had seized
in woful slaughter the Weders king
There saw they besides the strangest being
loathsome lying their leader near
prone on the field The fiery dragon
fearful fiend with flame was scorched
Reckoned by feet it was fifty measures
in length as it lay Aloft erewhile
it had revelled by night and anon come back
seeking its den now in deaths sure clutch
it had come to the end of its earthhall joys
By it there stood the stoups and jars
dishes lay there and deardecked swords
eaten with rust as on earths lap resting
a thousand winters they waited there
For all that heritage huge that gold
of bygone men was bound by a spell 39e
so the treasurehall could be touched by none
of human kind  save that Heavens King
God himself might give whom he would
Helper of Heroes the hoard to open 
even such a man as seemed to him meet



XL

A PERILOUS path it proved he 40a trod
who heinously hid that hall within
wealth under wall Its watcher had killed
one of a few 40b and the feud was avenged
in woful fashion Wondrous seems it
what manner a man of might and valor
oft ends his life when the earl no longer
in meadhall may live with loving friends
So Beowulf when that barrows warden
he sought and the struggle himself knew not
in what wise he should wend from the world at last
For 40c princes potent who placed the gold
with a curse to doomsday covered it deep
so that marked with sin the man should be
hedged with horrors in hellbonds fast
racked with plagues who should rob their hoard
Yet no greed for gold but the grace of heaven
ever the king had kept in view 40d
Wiglaf spake the son of Weohstan 
At the mandate of one oft warriors many
sorrow must suffer and so must we
The peoplesshepherd showed not aught
of care for our counsel king beloved
That guardian of gold he should grapple not urged we
but let him lie where he long had been
in his earthhall waiting the end of the world
the hest of heaven  This hoard is ours
but grievously gotten too grim the fate
which thither carried our king and lord
I was within there and all I viewed
the chambered treasure when chance allowed me
and my path was made in no pleasant wise
under the earthwall Eager I seized
such heap from the hoard as hands could bear
and hurriedly carried it hither back
to my liege and lord Alive was he still
still wielding his wits The wise old man
spake much in his sorrow and sent you greetings
and bade that ye build when he breathed no more
on the place of his balefire a barrow high
memorial mighty Of men was he
worthiest warrior wide earth oer
the while he had joy of his jewels and burg
Let us set out in haste now the second time
to see and search this store of treasure
these wallhid wonders  the way I show you 
where gathered near ye may gaze your fill
at broadgold and rings Let the bier soon made
be all in order when out we come
our king and captain to carry thither
 man beloved  where long he shall bide
safe in the shelter of sovran God
Then the bairn of Weohstan bade command
hardy chief to heroes many
that owned their homesteads hither to bring
firewood from far  oer the folk they ruled 
for the famedones funeral  Fire shall devour
and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior
who oft stood stout in the ironshower
when sped from the string a storm of arrows
shot oer the shieldwall the shaft held firm
featly feathered followed the barb
And now the sage young son of Weohstan
seven chose of the chieftains thanes
the best he found that band within
and went with these warriors one of eight
under hostile roof In hand one bore
a lighted torch and led the way
No lots they cast for keeping the hoard
when once the warriors saw it in hall
altogether without a guardian
lying there lost And little they mourned
when they had hastily haled it out
dearbought treasure The dragon they cast
the worm oer the wall for the wave to take
and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems
Then the woven gold on a wain was laden 
countless quite  and the king was borne
hoary hero to HronesNess



XLI

THEN fashioned for him the folk of Geats
firm on the earth a funeralpile
and hung it with helmets and harness of war
and breastplates bright as the boon he asked
and they laid amid it the mighty chieftain
heroes mourning their master dear
Then on the hill that hugest of balefires
the warriors wakened Woodsmoke rose
black over blaze and blent was the roar
of flame with weeping the wind was still
till the fire had broken the frame of bones
hot at the heart In heavy mood
their misery moaned they their masters death
Wailing her woe the widow 41a old
her hair upbound for Beowulfs death
sung in her sorrow and said full oft
she dreaded the doleful days to come
deaths enow and doom of battle
and shame  The smoke by the sky was devoured
The folk of the Weders fashioned there
on the headland a barrow broad and high
by oceanfarers far descried
in ten days time their toil had raised it
the battlebraves beacon Round brands of the pyre
a wall they built the worthiest ever
that wit could prompt in their wisest men
They placed in the barrow that precious booty
the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile
hardy heroes from hoard in cave 
trusting the ground with treasure of earls
gold in the earth where ever it lies
useless to men as of yore it was
Then about that barrow the battlekeen rode
athelingborn a band of twelve
lament to make to mourn their king
chant their dirge and their chieftain honor
They praised his earlship his acts of prowess
worthily witnessed and well it is
that men their masterfriend mightily laud
heartily love when hence he goes
from life in the body forlorn away

Thus made their mourning the men of Geatland
for their heros passing his hearthcompanions
quoth that of all the kings of earth
of men he was mildest and most beloved
to his kin the kindest keenest for praise



Footnotes

0a Not of course Beowulf the Great hero of the epic

0b Kenning for king or chieftain of a comitatus he breaks off
gold from the spiral rings  often worn on the arm  and so
rewards his followers

1a That is The Hart or Stag so called from decorations in
the gables that resembled the antlers of a deer This hall has been
carefully described in a pamphlet by Heyne The building was
rectangular with opposite doors  mainly west and east  and a
hearth in the middle of th single room A row of pillars down each
side at some distance from the walls made a space which was raised
a little above the main floor and was furnished with two rows of
seats On one side usually south was the highseat midway between
the doors Opposite this on the other raised space was another
seat of honor At the banquet soon to be described Hrothgar sat in
the south or chief highseat and Beowulf opposite to him The scene
for a flying see below v499 was thus very effectively set
Planks on trestles  the board of later English literature 
formed the tables just in front of the long rows of seats and were
taken away after banquets when the retainers were ready to stretch
themselves out for sleep on the benches

1b Fire was the usual end of these halls See v 781 below One
thinks of the splendid scene at the end of the Nibelungen of the
Nialssaga of Saxos story of Amlethus and many a less famous
instance

1c It is to be supposed that all hearers of this poem knew how
Hrothgars hall was burnt  perhaps in the unsuccessful attack
made on him by his soninlaw Ingeld

1d A skilled minstrel The Danes are heathens as one is told
presently but this lay of beginnings is taken from Genesis

1e A disturber of the border one who sallies from his haunt in
the fen and roams over the country near by This probably pagan
nuisance is now furnished with biblical credentials as a fiend or
devil in good standing so that all Christian Englishmen might read
about him Grendel may mean one who grinds and crushes

1f Cains

1g Giants

2a The smaller buildings within the main enclosure but separate
from the hall

2b Grendel

2c Sorcerersofhell

2d Hrothgar who is the Scyldingsfriend of 170

2e That is in formal or prescribed phrase

3a Ship

3b That is since Beowulf selected his ship and led his men to the
harbor

3c One of the auxiliary names of the Geats

3d Or Not thus openly ever came warriors hither yet

4a Hrothgar

4b Beowulfs helmet has several boarimages on it he is the man
of war and the boarhelmet guards him as typical representative of
the marching party as a whole The boar was sacred to Freyr who was
the favorite god of the Germanic tribes about the North Sea and the
Baltic Rude representations of warriors show the boar on the helmet
quite as large as the helmet itself

5a Either merely paved the strata via of the Romans or else
thought of as a sort of mosaic an extravagant touch like the
reckless waste of gold on the walls and roofs of a hall

6a The nicor says Bugge is a hippopotamus a walrus says Ten
Brink But that watergoblin who covers the space from Old Nick of
jest to the Neckan and Nix of poetry and tale is all one needs and
Nicor is a good name for him

6b His own people the Geats

6c That is cover it as with a facecloth There will be no need
of funeral rites

6d Personification of Battle

6e The Germanic Vulcan

6f This mighty power whom the Christian poet can still revere
has here the general force of Destiny

7a There is no irrelevance here Hrothgar sees in Beowulfs
mission a heritage of duty a return of the good offices which the
Danish king rendered to Beowulfs father in time of dire need

7b Money for wergild or manprice

7c Ecgtheow Beowulfs sire

8a Began the fight

8b Breca

9a Murder

10a Beowulf  the one

11a That is he was a lost soul doomed to hell

12a Kenning for Beowulf

13a Guarded the treasure

13b Sc Heremod

13c The singer has sung his lays and the epic resumes its story
The timerelations are not altogether good in this long passage
which describes the rejoicings of the day after but the present
shift from the riders on the road to the folk at the hall is not
very violent and is of a piece with the general style

14a Unferth Beowulfs sometime opponent in the flyting

15a There is no horrible inconsistency here such as the critics
strive and cry about In spite of the ruin that Grendel and Beowulf
had made within the hall the framework and roof held firm and
swift repairs made the interior habitable Tapestries were hung on
the walls and willing hands prepared the banquet

15b From its formal use in other places this phrase to take cup
in hall or on the floor would seem to mean that Beowulf stood up
to receive his gifts drink to the donor and say thanks

15c Kenning for sword

15d Hrothgar He is also the refuge of the friends of Ing
below Ing belongs to myth

15e Horses are frequently led or ridden into the hall where folk
sit at banquet so in Chaucers Squires tale in the ballad of
King Estmere and in the romances

16a Manprice wergild

16b Beowulfs

16c Hrothgar

16d There is no need to assume a gap in the Ms As before about
Sigemund and Heremod so now though at greater length about Finn
and his feud a lay is chanted or recited and the epic poet
counting on his readers familiarity with the story  a fragment
of it still exists  simply gives the headings

16e The exact story to which this episode refers in summary is not
to be determined but the following account of it is reasonable and
has good support among scholars Finn a Frisian chieftain who
nevertheless has a castle outside the Frisian border marries
Hildeburh a Danish princess and her brother Hnaef with many
other Danes pays Finn a visit Relations between the two peoples
have been strained before Something starts the old feud anew and
the visitors are attacked in their quarters Hnaef is killed so is
a son of Hildeburh Many fall on both sides Peace is patched up a
stately funeral is held and the surviving visitors become in a way
vassals or liegemen of Finn going back with him to Frisia So
matters rest a while Hengest is now leader of the Danes but he is
set upon revenge for his former lord Hnaef Probably he is killed
in feud but his clansmen Guthlaf and Oslaf gather at their home a
force of sturdy Danes come back to Frisia storm Finns stronghold
kill him and carry back their kinswoman Hildeburh

16f The enemies must be the Frisians

16g Battlefield  Hengest is the princes thane companion of
Hnaef Folcwalds son is Finn

16h That is Finn would govern in all honor the few Danish
warriors who were left provided of course that none of them tried
to renew the quarrel or avenge Hnaef their fallen lord If again
one of Finns Frisians began a quarrel he should die by the sword

16i Hnaef

16j The high place chosen for the funeral see description of
Beowulfs funeralpile at the end of the poem

16k Wounds

17a That is these two Danes escaping home had told the story of
the attack on Hnaef the slaying of Hengest and all the Danish
woes Collecting a force they return to Frisia and kill Finn in his
home

17b Nephew to Hrothgar with whom he subsequently quarrels and
elder cousin to the two young sons of Hrothgar and Wealhtheow 
their natural guardian in the event of the kings death There is
something finely feminine in this speech of Wealhtheows apart from
its somewhat irregular and irrelevant sequence of topics Both she
and her lord probably distrust Hrothulf but she bids the king to be
of good cheer and turning to the suspect heaps affectionate
assurances on his probity My own Hrothulf will surely not forget
these favors and benefits of the past but will repay them to the
orphaned boy

19a They had laid their arms on the benches near where they slept

20a He surmises presently where she is

20b The connection is not difficult The words of mourning of
acute grief are said and according to Germanic sequence of
thought inexorable here the next and only topic is revenge But is
it possible Hrothgar leads up to his appeal and promise with a
skillful and often effective description of the horrors which
surround the monsters home and await the attempt of an avenging
foe

21a Hrothgar is probably meant

21b Meeting place

22a Kenning for sword Hrunting is bewitched laid under a spell
of uselessness along with all other swords

22b This brown of swords evidently meaning burnished bright
continues to be a favorite adjective in the popular ballads

23a After the killing of the monster and Grendels decapitation

23b Hrothgar

23c The blade slowly dissolves in bloodstained drops like
icicles

23d Spear

24a That is whoever has as wide authority as I have and can
remember so far back so many instances of heroism may well say as
I say that no better hero ever lived than Beowulf

25a That is he is now undefended by conscience from the
temptations shafts of the devil

25b Kenning for the sun  This is a strange role for the raven
He is the warriors bird of battle exults in slaughter and carnage
his joy here is a compliment to the sunrise

26a That is he might or might not see Beowulf again Old as he
was the latter chance was likely but he clung to the former
hoping to see his young friend again and exchange brave words in
the hall

27a With the speed of the boat

27b Queen to Hygelac She is praised by contrast with the
antitype Thryth just as Beowulf was praised by contrast with
Heremod

27c Kenning for wife

28a Beowulf gives his uncle the king not mere gossip of his
journey but a statesmanlike forecast of the outcome of certain
policies at the Danish court Talk of interpolation here is absurd
As both Beowulf and Hygelac know  and the folk for whom the
Beowulf was put together also knew  Froda was king of the
Heathobards probably the Langobards once near neighbors of Angle
and Saxon tribes on the continent and had fallen in fight with the
Danes Hrothgar will set aside this feud by giving his daughter as
peaceweaver and wife to the young king Ingeld son of the slain
Froda But Beowulf on general principles and from his observation
of the particular case foretells trouble Note

28b Play of shields battle A Danish warrior cuts down Froda in
the fight and takes his sword and armor leaving them to a son
This son is selected to accompany his mistress the young princess
Freawaru to her new home when she is Ingelds queen Heedlessly he
wears the sword of Froda in hall An old warrior points it out to
Ingeld and eggs him on to vengeance At his instigation the Dane is
killed but the murderer afraid of results and knowing the land
escapes So the old feud must break out again

28c That is their disastrous battle and the slaying of their
king

28d The sword

28e Beowulf returns to his forecast Things might well go somewhat
as follows he says sketches a little tragic story and with this
prophecy by illustration returns to the tale of his adventure

28f Not an actual glove but a sort of bag

29a Hygelac

29b This is generally assumed to mean hides though the text
simply says seven thousand A hide in England meant about 120
acres though the size of the acre varied

29c On the historical raid into Frankish territory between 512 and
520 AD The subsequent course of events as gathered from hints of
this epic is partly told in Scandinavian legend

29d The chronology of this epic as scholars have worked it out
would make Beowulf well over ninety years of age when he fights the
dragon But the fifty years of his reign need not be taken as
historical fact

29e The text is here hopelessly illegible and only the general
drift of the meaning can be rescued For one thing we have the old
myth of a dragon who guards hidden treasure But with this runs the
story of some noble last of his race who hides all his wealth
within this barrow and there chants his farewell to lifes glories
After his death the dragon takes possession of the hoard and watches
over it A condemned or banished man desperate hides in the
barrow discovers the treasure and while the dragon sleeps makes
off with a golden beaker or the like and carries it for
propitiation to his master The dragon discovers the loss and exacts
fearful penalty from the people round about

31a Literally loandays days loaned to man

31b Chattuarii a tribe that dwelt along the Rhine and took part
in repelling the raid of Hygelac Chocilaicus

31c Onla son of Ongentheow who pursues his two nephews Eanmund
and Eadgils to Heardreds court where they have taken refuge after
their unsuccessful rebellion In the fighting Heardred is killed

32a That is Beowulf supports Eadgils against Onela who is slain
by Eadgils in revenge for the carepaths of exile into which Onela
forced him

32b That is the king could claim no wergild or manprice from
one son for the killing of the other

32c Usual euphemism for death

32d Sc in the grave

33a Eofor for Wulf  The immediate provocation for Eofor in
killing the hoary Scylfing Ongentheow is that the latter has
just struck Wulf down but the king Haethcyn is also avenged by
the blow See the detailed description below

33b Hygelac

33c Shield

33d The hollow passage

34a That is although Eanmund was brothers son to Onela the
slaying of the former by Weohstan is not felt as cause of feud and
is rewarded by gift of the slain mans weapons

34b Both Wiglaf and the sword did their duty  The following is
one of the classic passages for illustrating the comitatus as the
most conspicuous Germanic institution and its underlying sense of
duty based partly on the idea of loyalty and partly on the
practical basis of benefits received and repaid

34c Sc than to bide safely here  a common figure of
incomplete comparison

34d Wiglafs wooden shield

34e Gering would translate kinsman of the nail as both are made
of iron

35a That is swords

36a Where Beowulf lay

37a What had been left or made by the hammer wellforged

37b Trying to revive him

38a Nothing

38b Dead

38c Deathwatch guard of honor lykewake

38d A name for the Franks

38e Ongentheow

38f Haethcyn

39a The line may mean till Hrethelings stormed on the hedged
shields  ie the shieldwall or hedge of defensive war 
Hrethelings of course are Geats

39b Eofor brother to Wulf Wonreding

39c Sc value in hides and the weight of the gold

39d Not at all

39e Laid on it when it was put in the barrow This spell or in
our days the curse either prevented discovery or brought dire
ills on the finder and taker

40a Probably the fugitive is meant who discovered the hoard Ten
Brink and Gering assume that the dragon is meant Hid may well
mean here took while in hiding

40b That is one and a few others But Beowulf seems to be
indicated

40c Ten Brink points out the strongly heathen character of this
part of the epic Beowulfs end came so the old tradition ran from
his unwitting interference with spellbound treasure

40d A hard saying variously interpreted In any case it is the
somewhat clumsy effort of the Christian poet to tone down the
heathenism of his material by an edifying observation

41a Nothing is said of Beowulfs wife in the poem but Bugge
surmises that Beowulf finally accepted Hygds offer of kingdom and
hoard and as was usual took her into the bargain

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
