Sir

As per your email of February 7th I informed Mr Jean Clottes Scientific
Consul to the DeputyDirector of Archeology and author of the four
photographs and the texts concerning the cave paintings discovered
in Ardhche to get his authorization for the utilization
of his photographs by the staff of Project Gutenbergs CDROM

Following are the English and Frenchlanguage descriptions




AN EXCEPTIONAL ARCHEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY

A Paleolithical Embellished Cave found in France Ardeche

An exceptional archeological discovery has been made public on
January 17 1995 by the Minister of Culture and FrenchSpeaking
language Francophonie Mr Jacques TOUBON

Discovered during December 1994 at VallonPontdArc Ardeche
France the cave composed of several spacious galleries and
dens is adorned with some 300 paleolithical paintings and
engravings dating 18000  20000 years before present time
which focus on a wide variety of animals including bears owls
mammooths rhinos and felines

The cave has also retained several vestiges of human activities
fireplaces hearths entailed flints and other clues which denote an
evolution in tools and habits Totally left intact and untouched by any
human intrusion throughout the ages the cave represents and
exceptional source of studies for archeologists

In the wake of the artistical and archeological interest spawned by
this thrilling discovery of national and international importance the
Director of Cultural Heritage has signed on January 13th the
proceedings to classify the site I dont know if the translation
makes sense a classified site is a site which due to its cultural
importance becomes an official patrimony of the nation This
urgency measure taking effect immediately confers the cave for
one year the same statute and privileges which the historical
monuments benefit

In order to ensure the preservation and the security of the cave the
Prefect of Ardeche has also signed on January 13 a bylaw
prohibiting the access to the cavity

Paris January the 18th 1995






This is the original message we received in French




Decouverte dune grotte
ornee paleolithique a VallonPontdArc
Ardeche

Cliches  Ministere de la culture et de la francophonie  Direction du
Patrimoine
Jean Clottes Tous droits reserves


Une decouverte archeologique dune importance exceptionnelle vient
dintervenir dans les gorges de lArdeche en limite du site naturel
classe en lespece dun vaste reseau souterrain orne dun tres grand
nombre de peintures et de gravures depoque paleolithique vers
1800020000 ans avant le present

La decouverte est intervenue sur le territoire de la commune de
VallonPontdArc le 25 decembre dernier dans le cadre dune
prospection archeologique autorisee au titre des dispositions de la loi
validee du 27 septembre 1941 portant reglementation de la recherche
archeologique de France Elle est le fait de M JeanMarie Chauvet
agent de surveillance titulaire au sein du Service regional de
larcheologie DRAC RhneAlpes assiste de deux benevoles Mme
Eliette BrunelDeschamps et M Christian Hillaire


Au terme dune desobstruction manuelle conduite dans un boyau tres
etroit marquant le fond dune cavite mineure souvrant dans les
falaises du Cirque dEstre les inventeurs ont debouche par une
cheminee dans un tres vaste reseau totalement vierge richement
concretionne et recelant de nombreux restes paleontologiques en place
os dours de cavernes Ursus spelaeus dans leur bauge dhibernation
Les galeries fortement dimensionnees section de 5 x 4 metres en
moyenne joignent plusieurs vastes salles jusqua 70 x 40 metres et
sont de place en place decorees de peintures et de gravures de
figurations animalieres isolees ou organisees en panneaux comprenant
plus de cinquante unites dont les dimensions varient de 050 m a 4
metres de long Au total environ 300 peintures a locre rouge ou au
noir ont ete actuellement observees et au moins autant de gravures On
remarque plusieurs cas de superposition et localement des voiles
concretionnes ou des griffades dours lensemble de ces faits
authentifiant sil en etait besoin lanciennete de ces decors

a chaque extremite du reseau visite on peut constater la presence
dacces anciens actuellement colmates par des eboulis et des depots
argileux

Lensemble des galeries parcourues cumule un lineaire de plusieurs
centaines de metres au long duquel se developpe un bestiaire tres
original et particulierement varie chevaux rhinoceros lions bisons
aurochs ours pantheres mammouths bouquetins hiboux etc
accompagne de signes symboliques de panneaux ponctues et de mains
positives ou negatives

Au plan artistique il se degage un ensemble absolument unique dans le
Sud de la France que son importance et son originalite placent au meme
rang que lensemble figure de Lascaux meme sil noffre pas de
veritable polychromie ni le meme dimensionnement des representations

Partout les traits peints ou graves sont plus ou moins concretionnes
Les traits peints vus dans leurs details presentent laspect erode
caracteristique des peintures anciennes meme celles apparemment les
mieux conservees En outre la grotte est vierge avec des sols intacts
et dinnombrables vestiges non touches Dans une salle un ensemble de
gravures cheval mammouth hibou se trouve sur une retombee de voute
a 5 ou 6 m du sol  audessous un vaste effondrement ancien explique
ce qui sest passe  une aspiration a provoque la formation de cet
entonnoir et le sol sur lequel se trouvait lartiste a alors disparu
de sorte que les gravures sont maintenant inaccessibles Donc
lauthenticite est evidente


La zone a peintures rouges comprend plusieurs panneaux de points
auxquels sajoutent parfois des signes y compris des signes complexes
originaux Les panneaux avec des animaux rouges sont divers  dans une
petite galerie un cerf est suivi tout au fond de trois ours des
cavernes et dun cheval Ailleurs un grand panneau comprend plusieurs
ours dont un a lavanttrain tachete un felin lui aussi tachete sur
le haut du corps un bouquetin et deux mammouths Sur une paroi se
voient un enorme rhinoceros a la corne disproportionnee trois autres
rhinoceros un mammouth deux felins quatre mains positives et deux ou
trois negatives un demicercles de points rouges un grand bovine
un signe fait de deux demicercles accoles En tout outre les points
et les signes plusieurs mains negatives completes et les mains
positives une trentaine de representations animales rouges et deux
petites tetes de chevaux jaunes ont deja ete denombres Lours domine
suivi du mammouth du cheval du rhinoceros du felin  le cerf le
bouquetin laurochs les indetermines netant representes qua un
seul exemplaire chacun



Une centaine de figures noires a ete denombree  les rhinoceros
dominent largement suivis des felins puis des chevaux les ours des
rennes des bisons des aurochs On note la presence de mammouths de
cerfs megaceros dun bouquetin de deux indetermines Parmi les
gravures a noter 5 mammouths 3 bouquetins 2 rhinoceros 2 chevaux 1
aurochs 1 hibou

La facture de ces representations est excellente Les proportions des
corps sont naturalistes Il sagit surtout de dessins au trait encore
que certains presentent des aplats de peinture a linterieur des tetes
ou des corps et un rendu savant du modele De nombreux details
anatomiques sont precises de sorte que les animaux sont le plus
souvent determinables sans ambiguite quant a lespece et meme quant au
sexe femelles bisons par exemple Les dessins noirs ont un air de
famille  la composition des panneaux la facture des animaux la
technique employee partout avec une egale maitrise feraient penser a
une meme main On peut legitimement se demander sil ne sagirait
pas en tres grande partie de loeuvre dune seule personne un
grand maitre du trait Les recherches futures le preciseront

Par le nombre et la diversite des oeuvres par leur qualite esthetique
et leur conservation par leur originalite aussi dominance despeces
rares ailleurs par la preservation du contexte cette grotte est
unique et dune importance mondiale Cest lun des plus grand chefs
doeuvres de lart prehistorique

Au plan paleontologique la cavite recele egalement les restes dune
centaine dursides soit en place dans leur loge dhibernation soit en
position secondaire que les os aient ete deplaces par le passage de
lHomme ou que certains cranes aient ete redisposes par lui en des
emplacements privilegies de la grotte par exemple au centre dune
salle en rotonde sur un bloc rocheux

Cette abondance de restes dans un milieu preserve de toute perturbation
moderne confere un second caractere dimportance a la decouverte

Au plan archeologique il convient de souligner le caractere unique
dun milieu clos exempt de toute intrusion et de tout remaniement
Outre les figurations lHomme a laisse dans la cavite de nombreux
temoins de ses activites  foyers silex tailles traces de torches
declairage amenagements de blocs rocheux agencement de restes
faunistiques et surtout de tres nombreuses empreintes de cheminement
melees a celles des ours qui ont ete leurs contemporains dans les
galeries On remarque egalement des points dextraction du sediment 
confection de boulettes dargile recherche doxydes de fer et de
manganese pour la confection des peintures

a ce jour il parait que la grotte est le seul reseau orne totalement
intact qui nous soit parvenu depuis le Paleolithique

Au plan de letude du milieu la tres recente ouverture de la cavite
permettra den etudier la climatologie interne Il convient aussi de
souligner la puissance des depots sedimentaires que la reprise
derosion posterieure a loccupation humaine a permis de mettre
ponctuellement en evidence dans des puits de dissolution diriges vers
le reseau perenne toujours actif a ce jour La carbonatation des
galeries est egalement intervenue apres le passage de lHomme scellant
en de nombreux points des artefacts dans la calcite

Il existe la une occasion unique detude naturaliste visant a retracer
levolution des milieux naturels durant le dernier glaciaire et
lHolocene

Cest la convergence de lensemble de ces caracteres deja
exceptionnels pour chacun dentre eux qui confere une importance
absolue au reseau nouvellement decouvert
