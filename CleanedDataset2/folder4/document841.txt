Preface


This is a book of stories For that reason I have excluded all purely
lyrical poems But the word stories has been stretched to its fullest
application It includes both narrative poems properly so called
tales divided into scenes and a few pieces of less obvious
storytelling import in which one might say that the dramatis personae
are air clouds trees houses streets and such like things

It has long been a favourite idea of mine that the rhythms of vers
libre have not been sufficiently plumbed that there is in them a power
of variation which has never yet been brought to the light of
experiment I think it was the piano pieces of Debussy with their
strange likeness to short vers libre poems which first showed me the
close kinship of music and poetry and there flashed into my mind the
idea of using the movement of poetry in somewhat the same way that the
musician uses the movement of music

It was quite evident that this could never be done in the strict pattern
of a metrical form but the flowing fluctuating rhythm of vers libre
seemed to open the door to such an experiment First however I
considered the same method as applied to the more pronounced movements
of natural objects If the reader will turn to the poem A Roxbury
Garden he will find in the first two sections an attempt to give the
circular movement of a hoop bowling along the ground and the up and
down elliptical curve of a flying shuttlecock

From these experiments it is but a step to the flowing rhythm of music
In The Cremona Violin I have tried to give this flowing changing
rhythm to the parts in which the violin is being played The effect is
farther heightened because the rest of the poem is written in the seven
line Chaucerian stanza and by deserting this ordered pattern for the
undulating line of vers libre I hoped to produce something of the
suave continuous tone of a violin Again in the violin parts
themselves the movement constantly changes as will be quite plain to
any one reading these passages aloud

In The Cremona Violin however the rhythms are fairly obvious and
regular I set myself a far harder task in trying to transcribe the
various movements of Stravinskys Three Pieces Grotesques for String
Quartet Several musicians who have seen the poem think the movement
accurately given

These experiments lead me to believe that there is here much food for
thought and matter for study and I hope many poets will follow me in
opening up the still hardly explored possibilities of vers libre

A good many of the poems in this book are written in polyphonic prose
A form about which I have written and spoken so much that it seems
hardly necessary to explain it here Let me hastily add however that
the word prose in its name refers only to the typographical
arrangement for in no sense is this a prose form Only read it aloud
Gentle Reader I beg and you will see what you will see For a purely
dramatic form I know none better in the whole range of poetry It
enables the poet to give his characters the vivid real effect they have
in a play while at the same time writing in the decor

One last innovation I have still to mention It will be found in
Spring Day and more fully enlarged upon in the series Towns in
Colour In these poems I have endeavoured to give the colour and
light and shade of certain places and hours stressing the purely
pictorial effect and with little or no reference to any other aspect of
the places described It is an enchanting thing to wander through a
city looking for its unrelated beauty the beauty by which it captivates
the sensuous sense of seeing

I have always loved aquariums but for years I went to them and looked
and looked at those swirling shooting looping patterns of fish which
always defied transcription to paper until I hit upon the unrelated
method The result is in An Aquarium I think the first thing which
turned me in this direction was John Gould Fletchers London
Excursion in Some Imagist Poets I here record my thanks

For the substance of the poemswhy the poems are here No one
writing today can fail to be affected by the great war raging in Europe
at this time We are too near it to do more than touch upon it But
obliquely it is suggested in many of these poems most notably those in
the section Bronze Tablets The Napoleonic Era is an epic subject
and waits a great epic poet I have only been able to open a few
windows upon it here and there But the scene from the windows is
authentic and the watcher has used eyes and ears and heart in
watching

MEN WOMEN AND GHOSTS




FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE




Patterns



 I walk down the garden paths
 And all the daffodils
 Are blowing and the bright blue squills
 I walk down the patterned gardenpaths
 In my stiff brocaded gown
 With my powdered hair and jewelled fan
 I too am a rare
 Pattern As I wander down
 The garden paths

 My dress is richly figured
 And the train
 Makes a pink and silver stain
 On the gravel and the thrift
 Of the borders
 Just a plate of current fashion
 Tripping by in highheeled ribboned shoes
 Not a softness anywhere about me
 Only whalebone and brocade
 And I sink on a seat in the shade
 Of a lime tree For my passion
 Wars against the stiff brocade
 The daffodils and squills
 Flutter in the breeze
 As they please
 And I weep
 For the limetree is in blossom
 And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom

 And the plashing of waterdrops
 In the marble fountain
 Comes down the gardenpaths
 The dripping never stops
 Underneath my stiffened gown
 Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin
 A basin in the midst of hedges grown
 So thick she cannot see her lover hiding
 But she guesses he is near
 And the sliding of the water
 Seems the stroking of a dear
 Hand upon her
 What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown
 I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground
 All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground

 I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths
 And he would stumble after
 Bewildered by my laughter
 I should see the sun flashing from his swordhilt and the buckles
 on his shoes
 I would choose
 To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths
 A bright and laughing maze for my heavybooted lover
 Till he caught me in the shade
 And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me
 Aching melting unafraid
 With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops
 And the plopping of the waterdrops
 All about us in the open afternoon
 I am very like to swoon
 With the weight of this brocade
 For the sun sifts through the shade

 Underneath the fallen blossom
 In my bosom
 Is a letter I have hid
 It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke
 Madam we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell
 Died in action Thursday sennight
 As I read it in the white morning sunlight
 The letters squirmed like snakes
 Any answer Madam said my footman
 No I told him
 See that the messenger takes some refreshment
 No no answer
 And I walked into the garden
 Up and down the patterned paths
 In my stiff correct brocade
 The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun
 Each one
 I stood upright too
 Held rigid to the pattern
 By the stiffness of my gown
 Up and down I walked
 Up and down

 In a month he would have been my husband
 In a month here underneath this lime
 We would have broke the pattern
 He for me and I for him
 He as Colonel I as Lady
 On this shady seat
 He had a whim
 That sunlight carried blessing
 And I answered It shall be as you have said
 Now he is dead

 In Summer and in Winter I shall walk
 Up and down
 The patterned gardenpaths
 In my stiff brocaded gown
 The squills and daffodils
 Will give place to pillared roses and to asters and to snow
 I shall go
 Up and down
 In my gown
 Gorgeously arrayed
 Boned and stayed
 And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace
 By each button hook and lace
 For the man who should loose me is dead
 Fighting with the Duke in Flanders
 In a pattern called a war
 Christ What are patterns for




Pickthorn Manor



 I

 How fresh the Dartles little waves that day
 A steely silver underlined with blue
 And flashing where the round clouds blown away
 Let drop the yellow sunshine to gleam through
 And tip the edges of the waves with shifts
 And spots of whitest fire hard like gems
 Cut from the midnight moon they were and sharp
 As wind through leafless stems
 The Lady Eunice walked between the drifts
 Of blooming cherrytrees and watched the rifts
 Of clouds drawn through the rivers azure warp


 II

 Her little feet tapped softly down the path
 Her soul was listless even the morning breeze
 Fluttering the trees and strewing a light swath
 Of fallen petals on the grass could please
 Her not at all She brushed a hair aside
 With a swift move and a halfangry frown
 She stopped to pull a daffodil or two
 And held them to her gown
 To test the colours put them at her side
 Then at her breast then loosened them and tried
 Some new arrangement but it would not do


 III

 A lady in a Manorhouse alone
 Whose husband is in Flanders with the Duke
 Of Marlborough and Prince Eugene shes grown
 Too apathetic even to rebuke
 Her idleness What is she on this Earth
 No woman surely since she neither can
 Be wed nor single must not let her mind
 Build thoughts upon a man
 Except for hers Indeed that were no dearth
 Were her Lord here for well she knew his worth
 And when she thought of him her eyes were kind


 IV

 Too lately wed to have forgot the wooing
 Too unaccustomed as a bride to feel
 Other than strange delight at her wifes doing
 Even at the thought a gentle blush would steal
 Over her face and then her lips would frame
 Some little word of loving and her eyes
 Would brim and spill their tears when all they saw
 Was the bright sun slantwise
 Through burgeoning trees and all the mornings flame
 Burning and quivering round her With quick shame
 She shut her heart and bent before the law


 V

 He was a soldier she was proud of that
 This was his house and she would keep it well
 His honour was in fighting hers in what
 Hed left her here in charge of Then a spell
 Of conscience sent her through the orchard spying
 Upon the gardeners Were their tools about
 Were any branches broken Had the weeds
 Been duly taken out
 Under the spaliered pears and were these lying
 Nailed snug against the sunny bricks and drying
 Their leaves and satisfying all their needs


 VI

 She picked a stone up with a little pout
 Stones looked so ill in wellkept flowerborders
 Where should she put it All the paths about
 Were strewn with fair red gravel by her orders
 No stone could mar their sifted smoothness So
 She hurried to the river At the edge
 She stood a moment charmed by the swift blue
 Beyond the river sedge
 She watched it curdling crinkling and the snow
 Purfled upon its wavetops Then Hullo
 My Beauty gently or youll wriggle through


 VII

 The Lady Eunice caught a willow spray
 To save herself from tumbling in the shallows
 Which rippled to her feet Then straight away
 She peered down stream among the budding sallows
 A youth in leather breeches and a shirt
 Of finest broidered lawn lay out upon
 An overhanging bole and deftly swayed
 A wellhooked fish which shone
 In the pale lemon sunshine like a spurt
 Of silver bowed and damascened and girt
 With crimson spots and moons which waned and played


 VIII

 The fish hung circled for a moment ringed
 And bright then flung itself out a thin blade
 Of spotted lightning and its tail was winged
 With chipped and sparkled sunshine And the shade
 Broke up and splintered into shafts of light
 Wheeling about the fish who churned the air
 And made the fishline hum and bent the rod
 Almost to snapping Care
 The young man took against the twigs with slight
 Deft movements he kept fish and line in tight
 Obedience to his will with every prod


 IX

 He lay there and the fish hung just beyond
 He seemed uncertain what more he should do
 He drew back pulled the rod to correspond
 Tossed it and caught it every time he threw
 He caught it nearer to the point At last
 The fish was near enough to touch He paused
 Eunice knew well the craftWhats got the thing
 She cried What can have caused
 Where is his net The moment will be past
 The fish will wriggle free She stopped aghast
 He turned and bowed One arm was in a sling


 X

 The broad black ribbon she had thought his basket
 Must hang from held instead a useless arm
 I do not wonder Madam that you ask it
 He smiled for she had spoke aloud The charm
 Of trout fishing is in my eyes enhanced
 When you must play your fish on land as well
 How will you take him Eunice asked In truth
 I really cannot tell
 Twas stupid of me but it simply chanced
 I never thought of that until he glanced
 Into the branches Tis a bit uncouth


 XI

 He watched the fish against the blowing sky
 Writhing and glittering pulling at the line
 The hook is fast I might just let him die
 He mused But that would jar against your fine
 Sense of true sportsmanship I know it would
 Cried Eunice Let me do it Swift and light
 She ran towards him It is so long now
 Since I have felt a bite
 I lost all heart for everything She stood
 Supple and strong beside him and her blood
 Tingled her lissom body to a glow


 XII

 She quickly seized the fish and with a stone
 Ended its flurry then removed the hook
 Untied the fly with wellpoised fingers Done
 She asked him where he kept his fishingbook
 He pointed to a coat flung on the ground
 She searched the pockets found a shagreen case
 Replaced the fly noticed a golden stamp
 Filling the middle space
 Two letters half rubbed out were there and round
 About them gay rococo flowers wound
 And tossed a spray of roses to the clamp


 XIII

 The Lady Eunice puzzled over these
 G D the young man gravely said My name
 Is Gervase Deane Your servant if you please
 Oh Sir indeed I know you for your fame
 For exploits in the field has reached my ears
 I did not know you wounded and returned
 But just come back Madam A silly prick
 To gain me such unearned
 Holiday making And you it appears
 Must be Sir Everards lady And my fears
 At being caught atrespassing were quick


 XIV

 He looked so rueful that she laughed out loud
 You are forgiven Mr Deane Even more
 I offer you the fishing and am proud
 That you should find it pleasant from this shore
 Nobody fishes now my husband used
 To angle daily and I too with him
 He loved the spotted trout and pike and dace
 He even had a whim
 That flies my fingers tied swiftly confused
 The greater fish And he must be excused
 Love weaves odd fancies in a lonely place


 XV

 She sighed because it seemed so long ago
 Those days with Everard unthinking took
 The path back to the orchard Strolling so
 She walked and he beside her In a nook
 Where a stone seat withdrew beneath low boughs
 Fullblossomed hummed with bees they sat them down
 She questioned him about the war the share
 Her husband had and grown
 Eager by his clear answers straight allows
 Her hidden hopes and fears to speak and rouse
 Her numbed love which had slumbered unaware


 XVI

 Under the orchard trees daffodils danced
 And jostled turning sideways to the wind
 A dropping cherry petal softly glanced
 Over her hair and slid away behind
 At the far end through twisted cherrytrees
 The old house glowed geraniumhued with bricks
 Bloomed in the sun like roses low and long
 Gabled and with quaint tricks
 Of chimneys carved and fretted Out of these
 Grey smoke was shaken which the faint Spring breeze
 Tossed into nothing Then a thrushs song


 XVII

 Needled its way through sound of bees and river
 The notes fell round and starred between young leaves
 Trilled to a spiral lilt stopped on a quiver
 The Lady Eunice listens and believes
 Gervase has many tales of her dear Lord
 His bravery his knowledge his charmed life
 She quite forgets whos speaking in the gladness
 Of being this mans wife
 Gervase is wounded grave indeed the word
 Is kindly said but to a softer chord
 She strings her voice to ask with wistful sadness


 XVIII

 And is Sir Everard still unscathed I fain
 Would know the truth Quite well dear Lady quite
 She smiled in her content So many slain
 You must forgive me for a little fright
 And he forgave her not alone for that
 But because she was fingering his heart
 Pressing and squeezing it and thinking so
 Only to ease her smart
 Of painful apprehensive longing At
 Their feet the river swirled and chucked They sat
 An hour there The thrush flew to and fro


 XIX

 The Lady Eunice supped alone that day
 As always since Sir Everard had gone
 In the oakpanelled parlour whose array
 Of faded portraits in carved mouldings shone
 Warriors and ladies armoured ruffed peruked
 Van Dykes with long slim fingers Holbeins stout
 And heavyfeatured and one Rubens dame
 A peony just burst out
 With flaunting crimson flesh Eunice rebuked
 Her thoughts of gentler blood when these had duked
 It with the best and scorned to change their name


 XX

 A sturdy family and old besides
 Much older than her own the Earls of Crowe
 Since Saxon days these men had sought their brides
 Among the highest born but always so
 Taking them to themselves their wealth their lands
 But never their titles Stern perhaps but strong
 The Framptons fed their blood from richest streams
 Scorning the common throng
 Gazing upon these men she understands
 The toughness of the web wrought from such strands
 And pride of Everard colours all her dreams


 XXI

 Eunice forgets to eat watching their faces
 Flickering in the windblown candles shine
 Bluecoated lackeys tiptoe to their places
 And set out plates of fruit and jugs of wine
 The table glitters black like Winter ice
 The Dartles rushing and the gentle clash
 Of blossomed branches drifts into her ears
 And through the casement sash
 She sees each cherry stem a pointed slice
 Of splintered moonlight topped with all the spice
 And shimmer of the blossoms it uprears


 XXII

 In such a night she laid the book aside
 She could outnight the poet by thinking back
 In such a night she came here as a bride
 The date was graven in the almanack
 Of her clasped memory In this very room
 Had Everard uncloaked her On this seat
 Had drawn her to him bade her note the trees
 How white they were and sweet
 And later coming to her her dear groom
 Her Lord had lain beside her in the gloom
 Of moon and shade and whispered her to ease


 XXIII

 Her little taper made the room seem vast
 Caverned and empty And her beating heart
 Rapped through the silence all about her cast
 Like some loud dreadful deathwatch taking part
 In this sad vigil Slowly she undrest
 Put out the light and crept into her bed
 The linen sheets were fragrant but so cold
 And brimming tears she shed
 Sobbing and quivering in her barren nest
 Her weeping lips into the pillow prest
 Her eyes sealed fast within its smothering fold


 XXIV

 The morning brought her a more stoic mind
 And sunshine struck across the polished floor
 She wondered whether this day she should find
 Gervase afishing and so listen more
 Much more again to all he had to tell
 And he was there but waiting to begin
 Until she came They fished awhile then went
 To the old seat within
 The cherrys shade He pleased her very well
 By his discourse But ever he must dwell
 Upon Sir Everard Each incident


 XXV

 Must be related and each term explained
 How troops were set in battle how a siege
 Was ordered and conducted She complained
 Because he bungled at the fall of Liege
 The curious names of parts of forts she knew
 And aired with conscious pride her ravelins
 And counterscarps and lunes The day drew on
 And his dead fishs fins
 In the hot sunshine turned a mauvegreen hue
 At last Gervase guessing the hour withdrew
 But she sat long in still oblivion


 XXVI

 Then he would bring her books and read to her
 The poems of Dr Donne and the blue river
 Would murmur through the reading and a stir
 Of birds and bees make the white petals shiver
 And one or two would flutter prone and lie
 Spotting the smoothclipped grass The days went by
 Threaded with talk and verses Green leaves pushed
 Through blossoms stubbornly
 Gervase unconscious of dishonesty
 Fell into strong and watchful loving free
 He thought since always would his lips be hushed


 XXVII

 But lips do not stay silent at command
 And Gervase strove in vain to order his
 Luckily Eunice did not understand
 That he but read himself aloud for this
 Their friendship would have snapped She treated him
 And spoilt him like a brother It was now
 Gervase and Eunice with them and he dined
 Whenever shed allow
 In the oak parlour underneath the dim
 Old pictured Framptons opposite her slim
 Figure so bright against the chair behind


 XXVIII

 Eunice was happier than she had been
 For many days and yet the hours were long
 All Gervase told to her but made her lean
 More heavily upon the past Among
 Her hopes she lived even when she was giving
 Her morning orders even when she twined
 Nosegays to deck her parlours With the thought
 Of Everard her mind
 Solaced its solitude and in her striving
 To do as he would wish was all her living
 She welcomed Gervase for the news he brought


 XXIX

 Blackhearts and whitehearts bubbled with the sun
 Hid in their leaves and knocked against each other
 Eunice was standing panting with her run
 Up to the toolhouse just to get another
 Basket All those which she had brought were filled
 And still Gervase pelted her from above
 The buckles of his shoes flashed higher and higher
 Until his shoulders strove
 Quite through the top Eunice your spirits filled
 This tree Whitehearts He shook and cherries spilled
 And spat out from the leaves like falling fire


 XXX

 The wide sunwinged June morning spread itself
 Over the quiet garden And they packed
 Full twenty baskets with the fruit My shelf
 Of cordials will be stored with what it lacked
 In future none of us will drink strong ale
 But cherrybrandy Vastly good I vow
 And Gervase gave the tree another shake
 The cherries seemed to flow
 Out of the sky in cloudfuls like blown hail
 Swift Lady Eunice ran her farthingale
 Unnoticed tangling in a fallen rake


 XXXI

 She gave a little cry and fell quite prone
 In the long grass and lay there very still
 Gervase leapt from the tree at her soft moan
 And kneeling over her with clumsy skill
 Unloosed her bodice fanned her with his hat
 And his unguarded lips pronounced his heart
 Eunice my Dearest Girl where are you hurt
 His trembling fingers dart
 Over her limbs seeking some wound She strove
 To answer opened wide her eyes above
 Her knelt Sir Everard with face alert


 XXXII

 Her eyelids fell again at that sweet sight
 My Love she murmured Dearest Oh my Dear
 He took her in his arms and bore her right
 And tenderly to the old seat and Here
 I have you mine at last she said and swooned
 Under his kisses When she came once more
 To sight of him she smiled in comfort knowing
 Herself laid as before
 Close covered on his breast And all her glowing
 Youth answered him and ever nearer growing
 She twined him in her arms and soft festooned


 XXXIII

 Herself about him like a flowering vine
 Drawing his lips to cling upon her own
 A ray of sunlight pierced the leaves to shine
 Where her halfopened bodice let be shown
 Her white throat fluttering to his soft caress
 Halfgasping with her gladness And her pledge
 She whispers melting with delight A twig
 Snaps in the hornbeam hedge
 A cackling laugh tears through the quietness
 Eunice starts up in terrible distress
 My God Whats that Her staring eyes are big


 XXXIV

 Revulsed emotion set her body shaking
 As though she had an ague Gervase swore
 Jumped to his feet in such a dreadful taking
 His face was ghastly with the look it wore
 Crouching and slipping through the trees a man
 In worn blue livery a humpbacked thing
 Made off But turned every few steps to gaze
 At Eunice and to fling
 Vile looks and gestures back The ruffian
 By Christs Death I will split him to a span
 Of hogs thongs She grasped at his sleeve Gervase


 XXXV

 What are you doing here Put down that sword
 Thats only poor old Tony crazed and lame
 We never notice him With my dear Lord
 I ought not to have minded that he came
 But Gervase it surprises me that you
 Should so lack grace to stay here With one hand
 She held her gaping bodice to conceal
 Her breast I must demand
 Your instant absence Everard but new
 Returned will hardly care for guests Adieu
 Eunice youre mad His brain began to reel


 XXXVI

 He tried again to take her tried to twist
 Her arms about him Truly she had said
 Nothing should ever part them In a mist
 She pushed him from her clasped her aching head
 In both her hands and rocked and sobbed aloud
 Oh Where is Everard What does this mean
 So lately come to leave me thus alone
 But Gervase had not seen
 Sir Everard Then gently to her bowed
 And sickening spirit he told of her proud
 Surrender to him He could hear her moan


 XXXVII

 Then shame swept over her and held her numb
 Hiding her anguished face against the seat
 At last she rose a woman strickendumb
 And trailed away with slowlydragging feet
 Gervase looked after her but feared to pass
 The barrier set between them All his rare
 Joy broke to fragmentsworse than that unreal
 And standing lonely there
 His swollen heart burst out and on the grass
 He flung himself and wept He knew alas
 The loss so great his life could never heal


 XXXVIII

 For days thereafter Eunice lived retired
 Waited upon by one old servingmaid
 She would not leave her chamber and desired
 Only to hide herself She was afraid
 Of what her eyes might trick her into seeing
 Of what her longing urge her then to do
 What was this dreadful illness solitude
 Had tortured her into
 Her hours went by in a long constant fleeing
 The thought of that one morning And her being
 Bruised itself on a happening so rude


 XXXIX

 It grew ripe Summer when one morning came
 Her tirewoman with a letter printed
 Upon the seal were the Deane crest and name
 With utmost gentleness the letter hinted
 His understanding and his deep regret
 But would she not permit him once again
 To pay her his profound respects No word
 Of what had passed should pain
 Her resolution Only let them get
 Back the old comradeship Her eyes were wet
 With starting tears now truly she deplored


 XL

 His misery Yes she was wrong to keep
 Away from him He hardly was to blame
 Twas sheshe shuddered and began to weep
 Twas her fault Hers Her everlasting shame
 Was that she suffered him whom not at all
 She loved Poor Boy Yes they must still be friends
 She owed him that to keep the balance straight
 It was such poor amends
 Which she could make for rousing hopes to gall
 Him with their unfulfilment Tragical
 It was and she must leave him desolate


 XLI

 Hard silence he had forced upon his lips
 For long and long and would have done so still
 Had not shehere she pressed her finger tips
 Against her heavy eyes Then with forced will
 She wrote that he might come sealed with the arms
 Of Crowe and Frampton twined Her heart felt lighter
 When this was done It seemed her constant care
 Might some day cease to fright her
 Illness could be no crime and dreadful harms
 Did come from too much sunshine Her alarms
 Would lessen when she saw him standing there


 XLII

 Simple and kind a brother just returned
 From journeying and he would treat her so
 She knew his honest heart and if there burned
 A spark in it he would not let it show
 But when he really came and stood beside
 Her underneath the fruitless cherry boughs
 He seemed a tired man gaunt leadeneyed
 He made her no more vows
 Nor did he mention one thing he had tried
 To put into his letter War supplied
 Him topics And his mind seemed occupied


 XLIII

 Daily they met And gravely walked and talked
 He read her no more verses and he stayed
 Only until their conversation balked
 Of every natural channel fled dismayed
 Again the next day she would meet him trying
 To give her tone some healthy sprightliness
 But his uneager dignity soon chilled
 Her wellprepared address
 Thus Summer waned and in the mornings crying
 Of wild geese startled Eunice and their flying
 Whirred overhead for days and never stilled


 XLIV

 One afternoon of grey clouds and white wind
 Eunice awaited Gervase by the river
 The Dartle splashed among the reeds and whined
 Over the willowroots and a long sliver
 Of caked and slobbered foam crept up the bank
 All through the garden drifts of skirling leaves
 Blew up and settled down and blew again
 The cherrytrees were weaves
 Of empty knotted branches and a dank
 Mist hid the house mouldy it smelt and rank
 With sodden wood and still unfalling rain


 XLV

 Eunice paced up and down No joy she took
 At meeting Gervase but the custom grown
 Still held her He was late She sudden shook
 And caught at her stopped heart Her eyes had shown
 Sir Everard emerging from the mist
 His uniform was travelstained and torn
 His jackboots muddy and his eager stride
 Jangled his spurs A thorn
 Entangled trailed behind him To the tryst
 He hastened Eunice shuddered rana twist
 Round a sharp turning and she fled to hide


 XLVI

 But he had seen her as she swiftly ran
 A flash of white against the rivers grey
 Eunice he called My Darling Eunice Can
 You hear me It is Everard All day
 I have been riding like the very devil
 To reach you sooner Are you startled Dear
 He broke into a run and followed her
 And caught her faint with fear
 Cowering and trembling as though she some evil
 Spirit were seeing What means this uncivil
 Greeting Dear Heart He saw her senses blur


 XLVII

 Swaying and catching at the seat she tried
 To speak but only gurgled in her throat
 At last straining to hold herself she cried
 To him for pity and her strange words smote
 A coldness through him for she begged Gervase
 To leave her twas too much a second time
 Gervase must go always Gervase her mind
 Repeated like a rhyme
 This name he did not know In sad amaze
 He watched her and that hunted fearful gaze
 So unremembering and so unkind


 XLVIII

 Softly he spoke to her patiently dealt
 With what he feared her madness By and by
 He pierced her understanding Then he knelt
 Upon the seat and took her hands Now try
 To think a minute I am come my Dear
 Unharmed and back on furlough Are you glad
 To have your lover home again To me
 Pickthorn has never had
 A greater pleasantness Could you not bear
 To come and sit awhile beside me here
 A stone between us surely should not be


 XLIX

 She smiled a little wan and ravelled smile
 Then came to him and on his shoulder laid
 Her head and they two rested there awhile
 Each taking comfort Not a word was said
 But when he put his hand upon her breast
 And felt her beating heart and with his lips
 Sought solace for her and himself She started
 As one sharp lashed with whips
 And pushed him from her moaning his dumb quest
 Denied and shuddered from And he distrest
 Loosened his wife and long they sat there parted

 Eunice was very quiet all that day
 A little dazed and yet she seemed content
 At candletime he asked if she would play
 Upon her harpsichord at once she went
 And tinkled airs from Lullys Carnival
 And Bacchus newly brought away from France
 Then jaunted through a lively rigadoon
 To please him with a dance
 By Purcell for he said that surely all
 Good Englishmen had pride in national
 Accomplishment But tiring of it soon


 LI

 He whispered her that if she had forgiven
 His startling her that afternoon the clock
 Marked early bedtime Surely it was Heaven
 He entered when she opened to his knock
 The hours rustled in the trailing wind
 Over the chimney Close they lay and knew
 Only that they were wedded At his touch
 Anxiety she threw
 Away like a shed garment and inclined
 Herself to cherish him her happy mind
 Quivering unthinking loving overmuch


 LII

 Eunice lay long awake in the cool night
 After her husband slept She gazed with joy
 Into the shadows painting them with bright
 Pictures of all her future lifes employ
 Twin gems they were set to a single jewel
 Each shining with the other Soft she turned
 And felt his breath upon her hair and prayed
 Her happiness was earned
 Past Earls of Crowe should give their blood for fuel
 To light this Framptons hearthfire By no cruel
 Affrightings would she ever be dismayed


 LIII

 When Everard next day asked her in joke
 What name it was that she had called him by
 She told him of Gervase and as she spoke
 She hardly realized it was a lie
 Her vision she related but she hid
 The fondness into which she had been led
 Sir Everard just laughed and pinched her ear
 And quite out of her head
 The matter drifted Then Sir Everard chid
 Himself for laziness and off he rid
 To see his men and count his farminggear


 LIV

 At supper he seemed overspread with gloom
 But gave no reason why he only asked
 More questions of Gervase and round the room
 He walked with restless strides At last he tasked
 Her with a greater feeling for this man
 Than she had given Eunice quick denied
 The slightest interest other than a friend
 Might claim But he replied
 He thought she underrated Then a ban
 He put on talk and music Hed a plan
 To work at draining swamps at Pickthorn End


 LV

 Next morning Eunice found her Lord still changed
 Hard and unkind with bursts of anger Pride
 Kept him from speaking out His probings ranged
 All round his torment Lady Eunice tried
 To sooth him So a week went by and then
 His anguish flooded over with clenched hands
 Striving to stem his words he told her plain
 Tony had seen them brands
 Burning in Hell the man had said Again
 Eunice described her vision and how when
 Awoke at last she had known dreadful pain


 LVI

 He could not credit it and misery fed
 Upon his spirit day by day it grew
 To Gervase he forbade the house and led
 The Lady Eunice such a life she flew
 At his approaching footsteps Winter came
 Snowing and blustering through the Manor trees
 All the roofedges spiked with icicles
 In fluted companies
 The Lady Eunice with her tambourframe
 Kept herself sighing company The flame
 Of the birch fire glittered on the walls


 LVII

 A letter was brought to her as she sat
 Unsealed unsigned It told her that his wound
 The writers had so well recovered that
 To join his regiment he felt him bound
 But would she not wish him one short Godspeed
 He asked no more Her greeting would suffice
 He had resolved he never should return
 Would she this sacrifice
 Make for a dying man How could she read
 The rest But forcing her eyes to the deed
 She read Then dropped it in the fire to burn


 LVIII

 Gervase had set the river for their meeting
 As farthest from the farms where Everard
 Spent all his days How should he know such cheating
 Was quite expected at least no dullard
 Was Everard Frampton Hours by hours he hid
 Among the willows watching Dusk had come
 And from the Manor he had long been gone
 Eunice her burdensome
 Task set about Hooded and cloaked she slid
 Over the slippery paths and soon amid
 The sallows saw a boat tied to a stone


 LIX

 Gervase arose and kissed her hand then pointed
 Into the boat She shook her head but he
 Begged her to realize why and with disjointed
 Words told her of what peril there might be
 From listeners along the river bank
 A push would take them out of earshot Ten
 Minutes was all he asked then she should land
 He go away again
 Forever this time Yet how could he thank
 Her for so much compassion Here she sank
 Upon a thwart and bid him quick unstrand


 LX

 His boat He cast the rope and shoved the keel
 Free of the gravel jumped and dropped beside
 Her took the oars and they began to steal
 Under the overhanging trees A wide
 Gash of red lanternlight cleft like a blade
 Into the gloom and struck on Eunice sitting
 Rigid and stark upon the after thwart
 It blazed upon their flitting
 In merciless light A moment so it stayed
 Then was extinguished and Sir Everard made
 One leap and landed just a fraction short


 LXI

 His weight upon the gunwale tipped the boat
 To straining balance Everard lurched and seized
 His wife and held her smothered to his coat
 Everard loose me we shall drown and squeezed
 Against him she beat with her hands He gasped
 Never by God The slidden boat gave way
 And the black foamy water splitand met
 Bubbled up through the spray
 A wailing rose and in the branches rasped
 And creaked and stilled Over the treetops clasped
 In the blue evening a clear moon was set


 LXII

 They lie entangled in the twisting roots
 Embraced forever Their cold marriage bed
 Closecanopied and curtained by the shoots
 Of willows and pale birches At the head
 White lilies like still swans placidly float
 And sway above the pebbles Here are waves
 Sunsmitten for a threaded counterpane
 Goldwoven on their graves
 In perfect quietness they sleep remote
 In the green rippled twilight Death has smote
 Them to perpetual oneness who were twain




The Cremona Violin



 Part First

 Frau ConcertMeister Altgelt shut the door
 A storm was rising heavy gusts of wind
 Swirled through the trees and scattered leaves before
 Her on the clean flagged path The sky behind
 The distant town was black and sharp defined
 Against it shone the lines of roofs and towers
 Superimposed and flat like cardboard flowers

 A pasted city on a purple ground
 Picked out with luminous paint it seemed The cloud
 Split on an edge of lightning and a sound
 Of rivers full and rushing boomed through bowed
 Tossed hissing branches Thunder rumbled loud
 Beyond the town fast swallowing into gloom
 Frau Altgelt closed the windows of each room

 She bustled round to shake by constant moving
 The strange weird atmosphere She stirred the fire
 She twitched the suppercloth as though improving
 Its careful setting then her own attire
 Came in for notice tiptoeing higher and higher
 She peered into the wallglass now adjusting
 A straying lock or else a ribbon thrusting

 This way or that to suit her At last sitting
 Or rather plumping down upon a chair
 She took her work the stocking she was knitting
 And watched the rain upon the window glare
 In white bright drops Through the black glass a flare
 Of lightning squirmed about her needles Oh
 She cried What can be keeping Theodore so

 A roll of thunder set the casements clapping
 Frau Altgelt flung her work aside and ran
 Pulled open the house door with kerchief flapping
 She stood and gazed along the street A man
 Flung back the gardengate and nearly ran
 Her down as she stood in the door Why Dear
 What in the name of patience brings you here

 Quick Lotta shut the door my violin
 I fear is wetted Now Dear bring a light
 This clasp is very much too worn and thin
 Ill take the other fiddle out tonight
 If it still rains Tut Tut my child youre quite
 Clumsy Here help me hold the case while I
 Give me the candle No the insides dry

 Thank God for that Well Lotta how are you
 A bad storm but the house still stands I see
 Is my pipe filled my Dear Ill have a few
 Puffs and a snooze before I eat my tea
 What do you say That you were feared for me
 Nonsense my child Yes kiss me now dont talk
 I need a rest the theatres a long walk

 Her needles still her hands upon her lap
 Patiently laid Charlotta Altgelt sat
 And watched the rainrun window In his nap
 Her husband stirred and muttered Seeing that
 Charlotta rose and softly pitapat
 Climbed up the stairs and in her little room
 Found sighing comfort with a moon in bloom

 But even rainy windows silverlit
 By a newburst stormwhetted moon may give
 But poor content to loneliness and it
 Was hard for young Charlotta so to strive
 And down her eagerness and learn to live
 In placid quiet While her husband slept
 Charlotta in her upper chamber wept

 Herr ConcertMeister Altgelt was a man
 Gentle and unambitious that alone
 Had kept him back He played as few men can
 Drawing out of his instrument a tone
 So shimmeringsweet and palpitant it shone
 Like a bright thread of sound hung in the air
 Afloat and swinging upward slim and fair

 Above all things above Charlotta his wife
 Herr Altgelt loved his violin a fine
 Cremona pattern Stradivaris life
 Was flowering out of early discipline
 When this was fashioned Of softcutting pine
 The belly was The back of broadly curled
 Maple the head made thick and sharply whirled

 The slanting youthful soundholes through
 The belly of fine vigorous pine
 Mellowed each note and blew
 It out again with a woody flavour
 Tanged and fragrant as firtrees are
 When breezes in their needles jar

 The varnish was an orangebrown
 Lustered like glass thats long laid down
 Under a crumbling villa stone
 Purfled stoutly with mitres which point
 Straight up the corners Each curve and joint
 Clear and bold and thin
 Such was Herr Theodores violin

 Seven oclock the ConcertMeister gone
 With his best violin the rain being stopped
 Frau Lotta in the kitchen sat alone
 Watching the embers which the fire dropped
 The china shone upon the dresser topped
 By polished copper vessels which her skill
 Kept brightly burnished It was very still

 An air from Orfeo hummed in her head
 Herr Altgelt had been practising before
 The nights performance Charlotta had plead
 With him to stay with her Even at the door
 Shed begged him not to go I do implore
 You for this evening Theodore she had said
 Leave them tonight and stay with me instead

 A silly poppet Theodore pinched her ear
 Youd like to have our good Elector turn
 Me out I think But Theodore something queer
 Ails me Oh do but notice how they burn
 My cheeks The thunder worried me Youre stern
 And cold and only love your work I know
 But Theodore for this evening do not go

 But he had gone hurriedly at the end
 For she had kept him talking Now she sat
 Alone again always alone the trend
 Of all her thinking brought her back to that
 She wished to banish What would life be What
 For she was young and loved while he was moved
 Only by music Each day that was proved

 Each day he rose and practised While he played
 She stopped her work and listened and her heart
 Swelled painfully beneath her bodice Swayed
 And longing she would hide from him her smart
 Well Lottchen will that do Then what a start
 She gave and she would run to him and cry
 And he would gently chide her Fie Dear fie

 Im glad I played it well But such a taking
 Youll hear the thing enough before Ive done
 And she would draw away from him still shaking
 Had he but guessed she was another one
 Another violin Her strings were aching
 Stretched to the touch of his bow hand again
 He played and she almost broke at the strain

 Where was the use of thinking of it now
 Sitting alone and listening to the clock
 Shed best make haste and knit another row
 Three hours at least must pass before his knock
 Would startle her It always was a shock
 She listenedlistenedfor so long before
 That when it came her hearing almost tore

 She caught herself just starting in to listen
 What nerves she had rattling like brittle sticks
 She wandered to the window for the glisten
 Of a bright moon was tempting Snuffed the wicks
 Of her two candles Still she could not fix
 To anything The moon in a broad swath
 Beckoned her out and down the gardenpath

 Against the house her hollyhocks stood high
 And black their shadows doubling them The night
 Was white and still with moonlight and a sigh
 Of blowing leaves was there and the dim flight
 Of insects and the smell of aconite
 And stocks and Marvel of Peru She flitted
 Along the path where blocks of shadow pitted

 The even flags She let herself go dreaming
 Of Theodore her husband and the tune
 From Orfeo swam through her mind but seeming
 Changedshriller Of a sudden the clear moon
 Showed her a passerby inopportune
 Indeed but here he was whistling and striding
 Lotta squeezed in between the currants hiding

 The best laid plans of mice and men alas
 The stranger came indeed but did not pass
 Instead he leant upon the gardengate
 Folding his arms and whistling Lottas state
 Crouched in the prickly currants on wet grass
 Was far from pleasant Still the stranger stayed
 And Lotta in her currants watched dismayed

 He seemed a proper fellow standing there
 In the bright moonshine His cocked hat was laced
 With silver and he wore his own brown hair
 Tied but unpowdered His whole bearing graced
 A fine cloth coat and ruffled shirt and chased
 Swordhilt Charlotta looked but her position
 Was hardly easy When would his volition

 Suggest his walking on And then that tune
 A halfadozen bars from Orfeo
 Gone over and over and murdered What Fortune
 Had brought him there to stare about him so
 Ach Gott im Himmel Why will he not go
 Thought Lotta but the young man whistled on
 And seemed in no great hurry to be gone

 Charlotta crouched among the currant bushes
 Watched the moon slowly dip from twig to twig
 If Theodore should chance to come and blushes
 Streamed over her He would not care a fig
 Hed only laugh She pushed aside a sprig
 Of sharpedged leaves and peered then she uprose
 Amid her bushes Sir said she pray whose

 Garden do you suppose youre watching Why
 Do you stand there I really must insist
 Upon your leaving Tis unmannerly
 To stay so long The young man gave a twist
 And turned about and in the amethyst
 Moonlight he saw her like a nymph halfrisen
 From the green bushes which had been her prison

 He swept his hat off in a hurried bow
 Your pardon Madam I had no idea
 I was not quite alone and that is how
 I came to stay My trespass was not sheer
 Impertinence I thought no one was here
 And really gardens cry to be admired
 Tonight especially it seemed required

 And may I beg to introduce myself
 Heinrich Marohl of Munich And your name
 Charlotta told him And the artful elf
 Promptly exclaimed about her husbands fame
 So Lotta halfunwilling slowly came
 To conversation with him When she went
 Into the house she found the evening spent

 Theodore arrived quite wearied out and teased
 With all excitement in him burned away
 It had gone well he said the audience pleased
 And he had played his very best today
 But afterwards he had been forced to stay
 And practise with the stupid ones His head
 Ached furiously and he must get to bed


 Part Second

 Herr ConcertMeister Altgelt played
 And the four strings of his violin
 Were spinning like bees on a day in Spring
 The notes rose into the wide sunmote
 Which slanted through the window
 They lay like coloured beads arow
 They knocked together and parted
 And started to dance
 Skipping tripping each one slipping
 Under and over the others so
 That the polychrome fire streamed like a lance
 Or a comets tail
 Behind them
 Then a wail arosecrescendo
 And dropped from off the end of the bow
 And the dancing stopped
 A scent of lilies filled the room
 Long and slow Each large white bloom
 Breathed a sound which was holy perfume from a blessed censer
 And the hum of an organ tone
 And they waved like fans in a hall of stone
 Over a bier standing there in the centre alone
 Each lily bent slowly as it was blown
 Like smoke they rose from the violin
 Then faded as a swifter bowing
 Jumbled the notes like wavelets flowing
 In a splashing pashing rippling motion
 Between broad meadows to an ocean
 Wide as a day and blue as a flower
 Where every hour
 Gulls dipped and scattered and squawked and squealed
 And over the marshes the Angelus pealed
 And the prows of the fishingboats were spattered
 With spray
 And away a couple of frigates were starting
 To race to Java with all sails set
 Topgallants and royals and stunsails and jibs
 And wide moonsails and the shining rails
 Were polished so bright they sparked in the sun
 All the sails went up with a run
 They call me Hanging Johnny
 Awayioh
 They call me Hanging Johnny
 So hang boys hang
 And the sun had set and the high moon whitened
 And the ship heeled over to the breeze
 He drew her into the shade of the sails
 And whispered tales
 Of voyages in the China seas
 And his arm around her
 Held and bound her
 She almost swooned
 With the breeze and the moon
 And the slipping sea
 And he beside her
 Touching her leaning
 The ship careening
 With the white moon steadily shining over
 Her and her lover
 Theodore still her lover

 Then a quiver fell on the crowded notes
 And slowly floated
 A single note which spread and spread
 Till it filled the room with a shimmer like gold
 And noises shivered throughout its length
 And tried its strength
 They pulled it and tore it
 And the stuff waned thinner but still it bore it
 Then a wide rent
 Split the arching tent
 And balls of fire spurted through
 Spitting yellow and mauve and blue
 One by one they were quenched as they fell
 Only the blue burned steadily
 Paler and paler it grew andfadedaway
 Herr Altgelt stopped

 Well Lottachen my Dear what do you say
 I think Im in good trim Now lets have dinner
 Whats this my Love youre very sweet today
 I wonder how it happens Im the winner
 Of so much sweetness But I think youre thinner
 Youre like a bag of feathers on my knee
 Why Lotta child youre almost strangling me

 Im glad youre going out this afternoon
 The days are getting short and Im so tied
 At the Court Theatre my poor little bride
 Has not much junketing I fear but soon
 Ill ask our manager to grant a boon
 Tonight perhaps Ill get a pass for you
 And when I go why Lotta can come too

 Now dinner Love I want some onion soup
 To whip me up till that rehearsals over
 You know its odd how some women can stoop
 Fraeulein Gebnitz has taken on a lover
 A Jew named Goldstein No one can discover
 If its his money But she lives alone
 Practically Gebnitz is a stone

 Pores over books all day and has no ear
 For his wifes singing Artists must have men
 They need appreciation But its queer
 What messes people make of their lives when
 They should know more If Gebnitz finds out then
 His wife will pack Yes shut the door at once
 I did not feel it cold I am a dunce

 Frau Altgelt tied her bonnet on and went
 Into the streets A bright crisp Autumn wind
 Flirted her skirts and hair A turbulent
 Audacious wind it was now close behind
 Pushing her bonnet forward till it twined
 The strings across her face then from in front
 Slantingly swinging at her with a shunt

 Until she lay against it struggling pushing
 Dismayed to find her clothing tightly bound
 Around her every fold and wrinkle crushing
 Itself upon her so that she was wound
 In draperies as clinging as those found
 Sucking about a sea nymph on the frieze
 Of some old Grecian temple In the breeze

 The shops and houses had a quality
 Of hard and dazzling colour something sharp
 And buoyant like white puffing sails at sea
 The city streets were twanging like a harp
 Charlotta caught the movement skippingly
 She blew along the pavement hardly knowing
 Toward what destination she was going

 She fetched up opposite a jewellers shop
 Where filigreed tiaras shone like crowns
 And necklaces of emeralds seemed to drop
 And then float up again with lightness Browns
 Of striped agates struck her like cold frowns
 Amid the gaiety of topaz seals
 Carved though they were with heads and arms and wheels

 A row of pencils knobbed with quartz or sard
 Delighted her And rings of every size
 Turned smartly round like hoops before her eyes
 Amethystflamed or rubygirdled jarred
 To spokes and flashing triangles and starred
 Like rockets bursting on a festal day
 Charlotta could not tear herself away

 With eyes glued tightly on a golden box
 Whose rare enamel piqued her with its hue
 Changeable iridescent shuttlecocks
 Of shades and lustres always darting through
 Its level superimposing sheet of blue
 Charlotta did not hear footsteps approaching
 She started at the words Am I encroaching

 Oh Heinrich how you frightened me I thought
 We were to meet at three is it quite that
 No it is not he answered but Ive caught
 The trick of missing you One thing is flat
 I cannot go on this way Life is what
 Might best be conjured up by the word Hell
 Dearest when will you come Lotta to quell

 His effervescence pointed to the gems
 Within the window asked him to admire
 A bracelet or a buckle But one stems
 Uneasily the burning of a fire
 Heinrich was chafing pricked by his desire
 Little by little she wooed him to her mood
 Until at last he promised to be good

 But here he started on another tack
 To buy a jewel which one would Lotta choose
 She vainly urged against him all her lack
 Of other trinkets Should she dare to use
 A ring or brooch her husband might accuse
 Her of extravagance and ask to see
 A strict accounting or still worse might be

 But Heinrich would not be persuaded Why
 Should he not give her what he liked And in
 He went determined certainly to buy
 A thing so beautiful that it would win
 Her wavering fancy Altgelts violin
 He would outscore by such a handsome jewel
 That Lotta could no longer be so cruel

 Pity Charlotta torn in diverse ways
 If she went in with him the shopman might
 Recognize her give her her name in days
 To come he could denounce her In her fright
 She almost fled But Heinrich would be quite
 Capable of pursuing By and by
 She pushed the door and entered hurriedly

 It took some pains to keep him from bestowing
 A pair of ruby earrings carved like roses
 The setting twined to represent the growing
 Tendrils and leaves upon her Who supposes
 I could obtain such things It simply closes
 All comfort for me So he changed his mind
 And bought as slight a gift as he could find

 A locket frosted over with seed pearls
 Oblong and slim for wearing at the neck
 Or hidden in the bosom their joined curls
 Should lie in it And further to bedeck
 His love Heinrich had picked a whiff a fleck
 The merest puff of a thin linked chain
 To hang it from Lotta could not refrain

 From weeping as they sauntered down the street
 She did not want the locket yet she did
 To have him love her she found very sweet
 But it is hard to keep love always hid
 Then there was something in her heart which chid
 Her told her she loved Theodore in him
 That all these meetings were a foolish whim

 She thought of Theodore and the life they led
 So near together but so little mingled
 The great clouds bulged and bellied overhead
 And the fresh wind about her body tingled
 The crane of a large warehouse creaked and jingled
 Charlotta held her breath for very fear
 About her in the street she seemed to hear
 They call me Hanging Johnny
 Awayioh
 They call me Hanging Johnny
 So hang boys hang

 And it was Theodore under the racing skies
 Who held her and who whispered in her ear
 She knew her heart was telling her no lies
 Beating and hammering He was so dear
 The touch of him would send her in a queer
 Swoon that was half an ecstasy And yearning
 For Theodore she wandered slowly turning

 Street after street as Heinrich wished it so
 He had some aim she had forgotten what
 Their progress was confused and very slow
 But at the last they reached a lonely spot
 A garden far above the highest shot
 Of soaring steeple At their feet the town
 Spread open like a chequerboard laid down

 Lotta was dimly conscious of the rest
 Vaguely remembered how he clasped the chain
 About her neck She treated it in jest
 And saw his face cloud over with sharp pain
 Then suddenly she felt as though a strain
 Were put upon her collared like a slave
 Leashed in the meshes of this thing he gave

 She seized the flimsy rings with both her hands
 To snap it but they held with odd persistence
 Her eyes were blinded by two windblown strands
 Of hair which had been loosened Her resistance
 Melted within her from remotest distance
 Misty unreal his face grew warm and near
 And giving way she knew him very dear

 For long he held her and they both gazed down
 At the wide city and its blue bridged river
 From wooing he jested with her snipped the blown
 Strands of her hair and tied them with a sliver
 Cut from his own head But she gave a shiver
 When opening the locket they were placed
 Under the glass commingled and enlaced

 When will you have it so with us He sighed
 She shook her head He pressed her further No
 No Heinrich Theodore loves me and she tried
 To free herself and rise He held her so
 Clipped by his arms she could not move nor go
 But you love me he whispered with his face
 Burning against her through her kerchiefs lace

 Frau Altgelt knew she toyed with fire knew
 That what her husband lit this other man
 Fanned to hot flame She told herself that few
 Women were so discreet as she who ran
 No danger since she knew what things to ban
 She opened her house door at five oclock
 A short halfhour before her husbands knock


 Part Third

 The ResidenzTheater sparked and hummed
 With lights and people Gebnitz was to sing
 That rare soprano All the fiddles strummed
 With tuning up the woodwinds made a ring
 Of reedy bubbling noises and the sting
 Of sharp red brass pierced every eardrum patting
 From muffled tympani made a dark slatting

 Across the silver shimmering of flutes
 A bassoon grunted and an oboe wailed
 The celli pizzicatoed like great lutes
 And mutterings of double basses trailed
 Away to silence while loud harpstrings hailed
 Their thin bright colours down in such a scatter
 They lost themselves amid the general clatter

 Frau Altgelt in the gallery alone
 Felt lifted up into another world
 Before her eyes a thousand candles shone
 In the great chandeliers A maze of curled
 And powdered periwigs past her eyes swirled
 She smelt the smoke of candles guttering
 And caught the glint of jewelled fans fluttering

 All round her in the boxes Red and gold
 The house like rubies set in filigree
 Filliped the candlelight about and bold
 Young sparks with eyeglasses unblushingly
 Ogled fair beauties in the balcony
 An officer went by his steel spurs jangling
 Behind Charlotta an old man was wrangling

 About a playbill he had bought and lost
 Three drunken soldiers had to be ejected
 Frau Altgelts eyes stared at the vacant post
 Of ConcertMeister she at once detected
 The stir which brought him But she felt neglected
 When with no glance about him or her way
 He lifted up his violin to play

 The curtain went up Perhaps If so
 Charlotta never saw it go
 The famous Fraeulein Gebnitz singing
 Only came to her like the ringing
 Of bells at a festa
 Which swing in the air
 And nobody realizes they are there
 They jingle and jangle
 And clang and bang
 And never a soul could tell whether they rang
 For the plopping of guns and rockets
 And the chinking of silver to spend in ones pockets
 And the shuffling and clapping of feet
 And the loud flapping
 Of flags with the drums
 As the military comes
 Its a famous tune to walk to
 And I wonder where theyre off to
 Stepstepstepping to the beating of the drums
 But the rhythm changes as though a mist
 Were curling and twisting
 Over the landscape
 For a moment a rhythmless tuneless fog
 Encompasses her Then her senses jog
 To the breath of a stately minuet
 Herr Altgelts violin is set
 In tune to the slow sweeping bows and retreats and advances
 To curtsies brushing the waxen floor as the Court dances
 Long and peaceful like warm Summer nights
 When stars shine in the quiet river And against the lights
 Blundering insects knock
 And the Rathaus clock
 Booms twice through the shrill sounds
 Of flutes and horns in the lamplit grounds
 Pressed against him in the mazy wavering
 Of a country dance with her short breath quavering
 She leans upon the beating throbbing
 Music Laughing sobbing
 Feet gliding after sliding feet
 Hishers
 The ballroom blurs
 She feels the air
 Lifting her hair
 And the lapping of water on the stone stair
 He is there He is there
 Twang harps and squeal you thin violins
 That the dancers may dance and never discover
 The old stone stair leading down to the river
 With the chestnuttree branches hanging over
 Her and her lover
 Theodore still her lover

 The evening passed like this in a half faint
 Delirium with waking intervals
 Which were the entracts Under the restraint
 Of a large company the constant calls
 For oranges or syrops from the stalls
 Outside the talk the passing to and fro
 Lotta sat ill at ease incognito

 She heard the Gebnitz praised the tenor lauded
 The music vaunted as most excellent
 The scenery and the costumes were applauded
 The latter it was whispered had been sent
 From Italy The Herr Direktor spent
 A fortune on them so the gossips said
 Charlotta felt a lightness in her head

 When the next act began her eyes were swimming
 Her prodded ears were aching and confused
 The first notes from the orchestra sent skimming
 Her outward consciousness Her brain was fused
 Into the music Theodores music Used
 To hear him play she caught his single tone
 For all she noticed they two were alone


 Part Fourth

 Frau Altgelt waited in the chilly street
 Hustled by lackeys who ran up and down
 Shouting their coachmens names forced to retreat
 A pace or two by lurching chairmen thrown
 Rudely aside by linkboys boldly shown
 The ogling rapture in two bleary eyes
 Thrust close to hers in most unpleasant wise

 Escaping these she hit a liveried arm
 Was sworn at by this glittering gentleman
 And ordered off However no great harm
 Came to her But she looked a trifle wan
 When Theodore her belated guardian
 Emerged She snuggled up against him trembling
 Half out of fear half out of the assembling

 Of all the thoughts and needs his playing had given
 Had she enjoyed herself he wished to know
 Oh Theodore cant you feel that it was Heaven
 Heaven My Lottachen and was it so
 Gebnitz was in good voice but all the flow
 Of her last aria was spoiled by Klops
 A wretched flutist she was mad as hops

 He was so simple so matteroffact
 Charlotta Altgelt knew not what to say
 To bring him to her dream His lack of tact
 Kept him explaining all the homeward way
 How this thing had gone well that badly Stay
 Theodore she cried at last You know to me
 Nothing was real it was an ecstasy

 And he was heartily glad she had enjoyed
 Herself so much and said so But its good
 To be got home again He was employed
 In looking at his violin the wood
 Was old and evening air did it no good
 But when he drew up to the table for tea
 Something about his wifes vivacity

 Struck him as hectic worried him in short
 He talked of this and that but watched her close
 Tea over he endeavoured to extort
 The cause of her excitement She arose
 And stood beside him trying to compose
 Herself all whipt to quivering curdled life
 And he poor fool misunderstood his wife

 Suddenly broken through her anxious grasp
 Her musickindled love crashed on him there
 Amazed he felt her fling against him clasp
 Her arms about him weighing down his chair
 Sobbing out all her hours of despair
 Theodore a woman needs to hear things proved
 Unless you tell me I feel Im not loved

 Theodore went under in this tearing wave
 He yielded to it and its headlong flow
 Filled him with all the energy she gave
 He was a youth again and this bright glow
 This living vivid joy he had to show
 Her what she was to him Laughing and crying
 She asked assurances theres no denying

 Over and over again her questions till
 He quite convinced her every now and then
 She kissed him shivering as though doubting still
 But later when they were composed and when
 She dared relax her probings Lottachen
 He asked how is it your love has withstood
 My inadvertence I was made of wood

 She told him and no doubt she meant it truly
 That he was sun and grass and wind and sky
 To her And even if conscience were unruly
 She salved it by neat sophistries but why
 Suppose her insincere it was no lie
 She said for Heinrich was as much forgot
 As though hed never been within earshot

 But Theodores hands in straying and caressing
 Fumbled against the locket where it lay
 Upon her neck What is this thing Im pressing
 He asked Lets bring it to the light of day
 He lifted up the locket It should stay
 Outside my Dear Your mother has good taste
 To keep it hidden surely is a waste

 Pity again Charlotta straight aroused
 Out of her happiness The locket brought
 A chilly jet of truth upon her soused
 Under its icy spurting she was caught
 And choked and frozen Suddenly she sought
 The clasp but with such art was this contrived
 Her fumbling fingers never once arrived

 Upon it Feeling twisting round and round
 She pulled the chain quite through the lockets ring
 And still it held Her neck encompassed bound
 Chafed at the sliding meshes Such a thing
 To hurl her out of joy A gilded string
 Binding her folly to her and those curls
 Which lay entwined beneath the clustered pearls

 Again she tried to break the cord It stood
 Unclasp it Theodore she begged But he
 Refused and being in a happy mood
 Twitted her with her inefficiency
 Then looking at her very seriously
 I think Charlotta it is well to have
 Always about one what a mother gave

 As she has taken the great pains to send
 This jewel to you from Dresden it will be
 Ingratitude if you do not intend
 To carry it about you constantly
 With her fine taste you cannot disagree
 The locket is most beautifully designed
 He opened it and there the curls were twined

 Charlottas heart dropped beats like knittingstitches
 She burned a moment flaming then she froze
 Her face was jerked by little nervous twitches
 She heard her husband asking What are those
 Put out her hand quickly to interpose
 But stopped the gesture halfcomplete astounded
 At the calm way the question was propounded

 A pretty fancy Dear I do declare
 Indeed I will not let you put it off
 A lovely thought yours and your mothers hair
 Charlotta hid a gasp under a cough
 Never with my connivance shall you doff
 This charming gift He kissed her on the cheek
 And Lotta suffered him quite crushed and meek

 When later in their room she lay awake
 Watching the moonlight slip along the floor
 She felt the chain and wept for Theodores sake
 She had loved Heinrich also and the core
 Of truth unlovely startled her Wherefore
 She vowed from now to break this double life
 And see herself only as Theodores wife


 Part Fifth

 It was no easy matter to convince
 Heinrich that it was finished Hard to say
 That though they could not meet he saw her wince
 She still must keep the locket to allay
 Suspicion in her husband She would pay
 Him from her savings bit by bitthe oath
 He swore at that was startling to them both

 Her resolution taken Frau Altgelt
 Adhered to it and suffered no regret
 She found her husband all that she had felt
 His music to contain Her days were set
 In his as though she were an amulet
 Cased in bright gold She joyed in her confining
 Her eyes put out her lookingglass with shining

 Charlotta was so gay that old dull tasks
 Were furbished up to seem like rituals
 She baked and brewed as one who only asks
 The right to serve Her daily manuals
 Of prayer were duties and her festivals
 When Theodore praised some dish or frankly said
 She had a knack in making up a bed

 So Autumn went and all the mountains round
 The city glittered white with fallen snow
 For it was Winter Over the hard ground
 Herr Altgelts footsteps came each one a blow
 On the swept flags behind the currant row
 Charlotta stood to greet him But his lip
 Only flicked hers His ConcertMeistership

 Was first again This evening he had got
 Important news The opera ordered from
 Young Mozart was arrived That old despot
 The Bishop of Salzburg had let him come
 Himself to lead it and the parts still hot
 From copying had been tried over Never
 Had any music started such a fever

 The orchestra had cheered till they were hoarse
 The singers clapped and clapped The town was made
 With such a great attraction through the course
 Of Carnival time In what utter shade
 All other cities would be left The trade
 In music would all drift here naturally
 In his excitement he forgot his tea

 Lotta was forced to take his cup and put
 It in his hand But still he rattled on
 Sipping at intervals The new catgut
 Strings he was using gave out such a tone
 The Maestro had remarked it and had gone
 Out of his way to praise him Lotta smiled
 He was as happy as a little child

 From that day on Herr Altgelt more and more
 Absorbed himself in work Lotta at first
 Was patient and wellwishing But it wore
 Upon her when two weeks had brought no burst
 Of loving from him Then she feared the worst
 That his short interest in her was a light
 Flared up an instant only in the night

 Idomeneo was the operas name
 A name that poor Charlotta learnt to hate
 Herr Altgelt worked so hard he seldom came
 Home for his tea and it was very late
 Past midnight sometimes when he knocked His state
 Was like a flabby orange whose crushed skin
 Is thin with pulling and all dented in

 He practised every morning and her heart
 Followed his bow But often she would sit
 While he was playing quite withdrawn apart
 Absently fingering and touching it
 The locket which now seemed to her a bit
 Of some gone youth His music drew her tears
 And through the notes he played her dreading ears

 Heard Heinrichs voice saying he had not changed
 Beer merchants had no ecstasies to take
 Their minds off love So far her thoughts had ranged
 Away from her stern vow she chanced to take
 Her way one morning quite by a mistake
 Along the street where Heinrich had his shop
 What harm to pass it since she should not stop

 It matters nothing how one day she met
 Him on a bridge and blushed and hurried by
 Nor how the following week he stood to let
 Her pass the pavement narrowing suddenly
 How once he took her basket and once he
 Pulled back a rearing horse who might have struck
 Her with his hoofs It seemed the oddest luck

 How many times their business took them each
 Right to the other Then at last he spoke
 But she would only nod he got no speech
 From her Next time he treated it in joke
 And that so lightly that her vow she broke
 And answered So they drifted into seeing
 Each other as before There was no fleeing

 Christmas was over and the Carnival
 Was very near and tripping from each tongue
 Was talk of the new opera Each bookstall
 Flaunted it out in bills what airs were sung
 What singers hired Pictures of the young
 Maestro were for sale The town was mad
 Only Charlotta felt depressed and sad

 Each day now brought a struggle twixt her will
 And Heinrichs Twixt her love for Theodore
 And him Sometimes she wished to kill
 Herself to solve her problem For a score
 Of reasons Heinrich tempted her He bore
 Her moods with patience and so surely urged
 Himself upon her she was slowly merged

 Into his way of thinking and to fly
 With him seemed easy But next morning would
 The Stradivarius undo her mood
 Then she would realize that she must cleave
 Always to Theodore And she would try
 To convince Heinrich she should never leave
 And afterwards she would go home and grieve

 All thought in Munich centered on the part
 Of January when there would be given
 Idomeneo by Wolfgang Mozart
 The twentyninth was fixed And all seats even
 Those almost at the ceiling which were driven
 Behind the highest gallery were sold
 The inches of the theatre went for gold

 Herr Altgelt was a shadow worn so thin
 With work he hardly printed black behind
 The candle He and his old violin
 Made up one person He was not unkind
 But dazed outside his playing and the rind
 The pine and maple of his fiddle guarded
 A part of him which he had quite discarded

 It woke in the silence of frostbright nights
 In little lights
 Like willothewisps flickering fluttering
 Herethere
 Spurting sputtering
 Fading and lighting
 Together asunder
 Till Lotta sat up in bed with wonder
 And the faint grey patch of the window shone
 Upon her sitting there alone
 For Theodore slept

 The twentyeighth was last rehearsal day
 Twas called for noon so early morning meant
 Herr Altgelts only time in which to play
 His part alone Drawn like a monk whos spent
 Himself in prayer and fasting Theodore went
 Into the kitchen with a weary word
 Of cheer to Lotta careless if she heard

 Lotta heard more than his spoken word
 She heard the vibrating of strings and wood
 She was washing the dishes her hands all suds
 When the sound began
 Long as the span
 Of a white road snaking about a hill
 The orchards are filled
 With cherry blossoms at butterfly poise
 Hawthorn buds are cracking
 And in the distance a shepherd is clacking
 His shears snipsnipping the wool from his sheep
 The notes are asleep
 Lying adrift on the air
 In level lines
 Like sunlight hanging in pines and pines
 Strung and threaded
 All imbedded
 In the bluegreen of the hazy pines
 Lineslong straight lines
 And stems
 Long straight stems
 Pushing up
 To the cup of blue blue sky
 Stems growing misty
 With the many of them
 Redgreen mist
 Of the trees
 And these
 Woodflavoured notes
 The back is maple and the belly is pine
 The rich notes twine
 As though weaving in and out of leaves
 Broad leaves
 Flapping slowly like elephants ears
 Waving and falling
 Another sound peers
 Through little pine fingers
 And lingers peeping
 Ping Ping pizzicato something is cheeping
 There is a twittering up in the branches
 A chirp and a lilt
 And crimson atilt on a swaying twig
 Wings Wings
 And a little ruffledout throat which sings
 The forest bends tumultuous
 With song
 The woodpecker knocks
 And the songsparrow trills
 Every fir and cedar and yew
 Has a nest or a bird
 It is quite absurd
 To hear them cutting across each other
 Peewits and thrushes and larks all at once
 And a loud cuckoo is trying to smother
 A woodpigeon perched on a birch
 Roocoooooo
 Cuckoo Cuckoo Thats one for you
 A blackbird whistles how sharp how shrill
 And the great trees toss
 And leaves blow down
 You can almost hear them splash on the ground
 The whistle again
 It is double and loud
 The leaves are splashing
 And water is dashing
 Over those creepers for they are shrouds
 And men are running up them to furl the sails
 For there is a capful of wind today
 And we are already well under way
 The deck is aslant in the bubbling breeze
 Theodore please
 Oh Dear how you tease
 And the boatswains whistle sounds again
 And the men pull on the sheets
 My name is Hanging Johnny
 Awayioh
 They call me Hanging Johnny
 So hang boys hang
 The trees of the forest are masts tall masts
 They are swinging over
 Her and her lover
 Almost swooning
 Under the ballooning canvas
 She lies
 Looking up in his eyes
 As he bends farther over
 Theodore still her lover

 The suds were dried upon Charlottas hands
 She leant against the table for support
 Wholly forgotten Theodores eyes were brands
 Burning upon his music He stopped short
 Charlotta almost heard the sound of bands
 Snapping She put one hand up to her heart
 Her fingers touched the locket with a start

 Herr Altgelt put his violin away
 Listlessly Lotta I must have some rest
 The strain will be a hideous one today
 Dont speak to me at all It will be best
 If I am quiet till I go And lest
 She disobey he left her On the stairs
 She heard his mounting steps What use were prayers

 He could not hear he was not there for she
 Was married to a mummy a machine
 Her hand closed on the locket bitterly
 Before her on a chair lay the shagreen
 Case of his violin She saw the clean
 Sun flash the open clasp The lockets edge
 Cut at her fingers like a pushing wedge

 A heavy cart went by a distant bell
 Chimed ten the fire flickered in the grate
 She was alone Her throat began to swell
 With sobs What kept her here why should she wait
 The violin she had begun to hate
 Lay in its case before her Here she flung
 The cover open With the fiddle swung

 Over her head the hanging clocks loud ticking
 Caught on her ear Twas slow and as she paused
 The little door in it came open flicking
 A wooden cuckoo out Cuckoo It caused
 The forest dream to come again Cuckoo
 Smashed on the grate the violin broke in two

 Cuckoo Cuckoo the clock kept striking on
 But no one listened Frau Altgelt had gone




The CrossRoads



A bullet through his heart at dawn On the table a letter signed with a
womans name A wind that goes howling round the house and weeping as
in shame Cold November dawn peeping through the windows cold dawn
creeping over the floor creeping up his cold legs creeping over his
cold body creeping across his cold face A glaze of thin yellow
sunlight on the staring eyes Wind howling through bent branches A
wind which never dies down Howling wailing The gazing eyes glitter
in the sunlight The lids are frozen open and the eyes glitter


The thudding of a pick on hard earth A spade grinding and crunching
Overhead branches writhing winding interlacing unwinding
scattering tortured twinings tossings creakings Wind flinging
branches apart drawing them together whispering and whining among
them A waning lopsided moon cutting through black clouds A stream
of pebbles and earth and the empty spade gleams clear in the moonlight
then is rammed again into the black earth Tramping of feet Men and
horses Squeaking of wheels

Whoa Ready Jim

All ready

Something falls settles is still Suicides have no coffin

Give us the stake Jim Now

Pound Pound

Hell never walk Nailed to the ground

An ash stick pierces his heart if it buds the roots will hold him He
is a part of the earth now clay to clay Overhead the branches sway
and writhe and twist in the wind Hell never walk with a bullet in
his heart and an ash stick nailing him to the cold black ground


Six months he lay still Six months And the water welled up in his
body and soft blue spots chequered it He lay still for the ash stick
held him in place Six months Then her face came out of a mist of
green Pink and white and frail like Dresden china liliesofthevalley
at her breast pucecoloured silk sheening about her Under the young
green leaves the horse at a footpace the high yellow wheels of the
chaise scarcely turning her face rippling like grain ablowing under
her pucecoloured bonnet and burning beside her flaming within his
correct blue coat and brass buttons is someone What has dimmed the
sun The horse steps on a rolling stone a wind in the branches makes a
moan The little leaves tremble and shake turn and quake over and
over tearing their stems There is a shower of young leaves and a
suddensprung gale wails in the trees

The yellowwheeled chaise is rockingrocking and all the branches
are knockingknocking The sun in the sky is a flat red plate the
branches creak and grate She screams and cowers for the green foliage
is a lowering wave surging to smother her But she sees nothing The
stake holds firm The body writhes the body squirms The blue spots
widen the flesh tears but the stake wears well in the deep black
ground It holds the body in the still black ground


Two years The body has been in the ground two years It is worn away
it is clay to clay Where the heart moulders a greenish dust the
stake is thrust Late August it is and night a night flauntingly
jewelled with stars a night of shooting stars and loud insect noises
Down the road to Tilbury silenceand the slow flapping of large
leaves Down the road to Sutton silenceand the darkness of
heavyfoliaged trees Down the road to Wayfleet silenceand the
whirring scrape of insects in the branches Down the road to
Edgarstown silenceand stars like steppingstones in a pathway
overhead It is very quiet at the crossroads and the signboard
points the way down the four roads endlessly points the way where
nobody wishes to go

A horse is galloping galloping up from Sutton Shaking the wide still
leaves as he goes under them Striking sparks with his iron shoes
silencing the katydids Dr Morgan riding to a childbirth over Tilbury
way riding to deliver a woman of her firstborn son One oclock from
Wayfleet bell tower what a shower of shooting stars And a breeze all
of a sudden jarring the big leaves and making them jerk up and down
Dr Morgans hat is blown from his head the horse swerves and curves
away from the signpost An oathspursa blurring of grey mist A
quick left twist and the gelding is snorting and racing down the
Tilbury road with the wind dropping away behind him

The stake has wrenched the stake has started the body flesh from
flesh has parted But the bones hold tight socket and ball and
clamping them down in the hard black ground is the stake wedged
through ribs and spine The bones may twist and heave and twine but
the stake holds them still in line The breeze goes down and the round
stars shine for the stake holds the fleshless bones in line


Twenty years now Twenty long years The body has powdered itself
away it is clay to clay It is brown earth mingled with brown earth
Only flaky bones remain lain together so long they fit although not
one bone is knit to another The stake is there too rotted through
but upright still and still piercing down between ribs and spine in a
straight line

Yellow stillness is on the crossroads yellow stillness is on the
trees The leaves hang drooping wan The four roads point four yellow
ways saffron and gamboge ribbons to the gaze A little swirl of dust
blows up Tilbury road the wind which fans it has not strength to do
more it ceases and the dust settles down A little whirl of wind
comes up Tilbury road It brings a sound of wheels and feet The wind
reels a moment and faints to nothing under the signpost Wind again
wheels and feet louder Wind againagainagain A drop of rain
flat into the dust DropDrop Thick heavy raindrops and a
shrieking wind bending the great trees and wrenching off their leaves

Under the black sky bowed and dripping with rain up Tilbury road
comes the procession A funeral procession bound for the graveyard at
Wayfleet Feet and wheelsfeet and wheels And among them one who
is carried

The bones in the deep still earth shiver and pull There is a quiver
through the rotted stake Then stake and bones fall together in a
little puffing of dust

Like meshes of linked steel the rain shuts down behind the procession
now well along the Wayfleet road

He wavers like smoke in the buffeting wind His fingers blow out like
smoke his head ripples in the gale Under the signpost in the
pouring rain he stands and watches another quavering figure drifting
down the Wayfleet road Then swiftly he streams after it It flickers
among the trees He licks out and winds about them Over under
blown contorted Spindrift after spindrift smoke following smoke
There is a wailing through the trees a wailing of fear and after it
laughterlaughterlaughter skirling up to the black sky
Lightning jags over the funeral procession A heavy clap of thunder
Then darkness and rain and the sound of feet and wheels





A Roxbury Garden



 I

 Hoops

 Blue and pink sashes
 Crisscross shoes
 Minna and Stella run out into the garden
 To play at hoop

 Up and down the gardenpaths they race
 In the yellow sunshine
 Each with a big round hoop
 White as a stripped willowwand

 Round and round turn the hoops
 Their diamond whiteness cleaving the yellow sunshine
 The gravel crunches and squeaks beneath them
 And a large pebble springs them into the air
 To go whirling for a foot or two
 Before they touch the earth again
 In a series of little jumps

 Spring Hoops
 Spit out a shower of blue and white brightness
 The little crisscross shoes twinkle behind you
 The pink and blue sashes flutter like flags
 The hoopsticks are ready to beat you
 Turn turn Hoops In the yellow sunshine
 Turn your stripped willow whiteness
 Along the smooth paths

 Stella sings
 Round and round rolls my hoop
 Scarcely touching the ground
 With a swoop
 And a bound
 Round and round
 With a bumpety crunching scattering sound
 Down the garden it flies
 In our eyes
 The sun lies
 See it spin
 Out and in
 Through the paths it goes whirling
 About the beds curling
 Sway now to the loop
 Faster faster my hoop
 Round you come
 Up you come
 Quick and straight as before
 Run run my hoop run
 Away from the sun

 And the great hoop bounds along the path
 Leaping into the windbright air

 Minna sings
 Turn hoop
 Burn hoop
 Twist and twine
 Hoop of mine
 Flash along
 Leap along
 Right at the sun
 Run hoop run
 Faster and faster
 Whirl twirl
 Wheel like fire
 And spin like glass
 Fires no whiter
 Glass is no brighter
 Dance
 Prance
 Over and over
 About and about
 With the top of you under
 And the bottom at top
 But never a stop
 Turn about hoop to the tap of my stick
 I follow behind you
 To touch and remind you
 Burn and glitter so white and quick
 Round and round to the tap of a stick

 The hoop flies along between the flowerbeds
 Swaying the flowers with the wind of its passing

 Beside the foxgloveborder roll the hoops
 And the little pink and white bells shake and jingle
 Up and down their tall spires
 They roll under the snowball bush
 And the ground behind them is strewn with white petals
 They swirl round a corner
 And jar a bee out of a Canterbury bell
 They cast their shadows for an instant
 Over a bed of pansies
 Catch against the spurs of a columbine
 Jostle the quietness from a cluster of monkshood
 Pat Pat behind them come the little crisscross shoes
 And the blue and pink sashes stream out in flappings of colour

 Stella sings
 Hoop hoop
 Roll along
 Faster bowl along
 Hoop
 Slow to the turning
 Now goGo
 Quick
 Heres the stick
 Ratataptap it
 Pat it flap it
 Fly like a bird or a yellowbacked bee
 See how soon you can reach that tree
 Here is a path that is perfectly straight
 Roll along hoop or we shall be late

 Minna sings
 Trip about slip about whip about
 Hoop
 Wheel like a top at its quickest spin
 Then dear hoop we shall surely win
 First to the greenhouse and then to the wall
 Circle and circle
 And let the wind push you
 Poke you
 Brush you
 And not let you fall
 Whirring you round like a wreath of mist
 Hoopety hoop
 Twist
 Twist

 Tap Tap go the hoopsticks
 And the hoops bowl along under a grape arbour
 For an instant their willow whiteness is green
 Pale whitegreen
 Then they are out in the sunshine
 Leaving the halfformed grape clusters
 Atremble under their big leaves

 I will beat you Minna cries Stella
 Hitting her hoop smartly with her stick
 Stella Stella we are winning calls Minna
 As her hoop curves round a bed of clovepinks
 A hummingbird whizzes past Stellas ear
 And two or three yellowandblack butterflies
 Flutter startled out of a pillar rose
 Round and round race the little girls
 After their great white hoops

 Suddenly Minna stops
 Her hoop wavers an instant
 But she catches it up on her stick
 Listen Stella
 Both the little girls are listening
 And the scents of the garden rise up quietly about them
 Its the chaise Its Father
 Perhaps hes brought us a book from Boston
 Twinkle twinkle the little crisscross shoes
 Up the garden path
 Bluepinkan instant against the syringa hedge
 But the hoops white as stripped willowwands
 Lie in the grass
 And the grasshoppers jump back and forth
 Over them

 Battledore and Shuttlecock

 The shuttlecock soars upward
 In a parabola of whiteness
 Turns
 And sinks to a perfect arc
 Plat the battledore strikes it
 And it rises again
 Without haste
 Winged and curving
 Tracing its white flight
 Against the clipped hemlocktrees
 Plat
 Up again
 Orange and sparkling with sun
 Rounding under the blue sky
 Dropping
 Fading to greygreen
 In the shadow of the coned hemlocks
 Ninetyone Ninetytwo Ninetythree
 The arms of the little girls
 Come upand up
 Precisely
 Like mechanical toys
 The battledores beat at nothing
 And toss the dazzle of snow
 Off their parchment drums
 Ninetyfour Plat
 Ninetyfive Plat
 Back and forth
 Goes the shuttlecock
 Iciclewhite
 Leaping at the sharpedged clouds
 Overturning
 Falling
 Down
 And down
 Tinctured with pink
 From the upthrusting shine
 Of Oriental poppies

 The little girls sway to the counting rhythm
 Left foot
 Right foot
 Plat Plat
 Yellow heat twines round the handles of the battledores
 The parchment cracks with dryness
 But the shuttlecock
 Swings slowly into the iceblue sky
 Heaving up on the warm air
 Like a foambubble on a wave
 With feathers slanted and sustaining
 Higher
 Until the earth turns beneath it
 Poised and swinging
 With all the garden flowing beneath it
 Scarlet and blue and purple and white
 Blurred colour reflections in rippled water
 Changingstreaming
 For the moment that Stella takes to lift her arm
 Then the shuttlecock relinquishes
 Bows
 Descends
 And the sharp blue spears of the air
 Thrust it to earth

 Again it mounts
 Stepping up on the rising scents of flowers
 Buoyed up and under by the shining heat
 Above the foxgloves
 Above the guelderroses
 Above the greenhouse glitter
 Till the shafts of cooler air
 Meet it
 Deflect it
 Reject it
 Then down
 Down
 Past the greenhouse
 Past the guelderrose bush
 Past the foxgloves

 Ninetynine Stellas battledore springs to the impact
 Plunk Like the snap of a taut string
 Oh Minna
 The shuttlecock drops zigzagedly
 Out of orbit
 Hits the path
 And rolls over quite still
 Dead white feathers
 With a weight at the end

 Garden Games

 The tall clock is striking twelve
 And the little girls stop in the hall to watch it
 And the big ships rocking in a halfcircle
 Above the dial
 Twelve oclock
 Down the side steps
 Go the little girls
 Under their big round straw hats
 Minnas has a pink ribbon
 Stellas a blue
 That is the way they know which is which
 Twelve oclock
 An hour yet before dinner
 Mother is busy in the stillroom
 And Hannah is making gingerbread

 Slowly with lagging steps
 They follow the gardenpath
 Crushing a leaf of box for its acrid smell
 Discussing what they shall do
 And doing nothing

 Stella see that grasshopper
 Climbing up the bank
 What a jump
 Almost as long as my arm
 Run children run
 For the grasshopper is leaping away
 In halfcircle curves
 Shuttlecock curves
 Over the grasses
 Hand in hand the little girls call to him
 Grandfather grandfather gray
 Give me molasses or Ill throw you away

 The grasshopper leaps into the sunlight
 Goldengreen
 And is gone

 Lets catch a bee
 Round whirl the little girls
 And up the garden
 Two heads are thrust among the Canterbury bells
 Listening
 And fingers clasp and unclasp behind backs
 In a strain of silence

 White bells
 Blue bells
 Hollow and reflexed
 Deep tunnels of blue and white dimness
 Cool winetunnels for bees
 There is a floundering and buzzing over Minnas head

 Bend it down Stella Quick Quick
 The wide mouth of a blossom
 Is pressed together in Minnas fingers
 The stem flies up jiggling its flowerbells
 And Minna holds the dark blue cup in her hand
 With the bee
 Imprisoned in it
 Whirr Buzz Bump
 Bump Whiz Bang
 BANG
 The blue flower tears across like paper
 And a goldblack bee darts away in the sunshine

 If we could fly we could catch him
 The sunshine is hot on Stellas upturned face
 As she stares after the bee
 Well follow him in a dove chariot
 Come on Stella
 Run children
 Along the red gravel paths
 For a bee is hard to catch
 Even with a chariot of doves

 Tall still and cowled
 Stand the monkshoods
 Taller than the heads of the little girls
 A blossom for Minna
 A blossom for Stella
 Off comes the cowl
 And there is a purplepainted chariot
 Off comes the forward petal
 And there are two little green doves
 With green traces tying them to the chariot
 Now we will get in and fly right up to the clouds
 Fly Doves up in the sky
 With Minna and me
 After the bee

 Up one path
 Down another
 Run the little girls
 Holding their dove chariots in front of them
 But the bee is hidden in the trumpet of a honeysuckle
 With his wings folded along his back

 The dove chariots are thrown away
 And the little girls wander slowly through the garden
 Sucking the salvia tips
 And squeezing the snapdragons
 To make them gape
 Im so hot
 Lets pick a pansy
 And see the little man in his bath
 And play were he
 A royal bathtub
 Hung with purple stuffs and yellow
 The great purpleyellow wings
 Rise up behind the little red and green man
 The purpleyellow wings fan him
 He dabbles his feet in cool green
 Off with the green sheath
 And there are two spindly legs
 Heigho sighs Minna
 Heigho sighs Stella
 There is not a flutter of wind
 And the sun is directly overhead

 Along the edge of the garden
 Walk the little girls
 Their hats round and yellow like cheeses
 Are dangling by the ribbons
 The grass is a tumult of buttercups and daisies
 Buttercups and daisies streaming away
 Up the hill
 The garden is purple and pink and orange and scarlet
 The garden is hot with colours
 But the meadow is only yellow and white and green
 Cool and long and quiet
 The little girls pick buttercups
 And hold them under each others chins
 Youre as gold as Grandfathers snuffbox
 Youre going to be very rich Minna
 Ohoo Then Ill ask my husband to give me a pair of garnet earrings
 Just like Aunt Nancys
 I wonder if he will
 I know Well tell fortunes
 Thats what well do
 Plump down in the meadow grass
 Stella and Minna
 With their round yellow hats
 Like cheeses
 Beside them
 Drop
 Drop
 Daisy petals
 One I love
 Two I love
 Three I love I say
 The ground is peppered with daisy petals
 And the little girls nibble the golden centres
 And play it is cake

 A bell rings
 Dinnertime
 And after dinner there are lessons

 The TrumpetVine Arbour

 The throats of the little red trumpetflowers are wide open
 And the clangour of brass beats against the hot sunlight
 They bray and blare at the burning sky
 Red Red Coarse notes of red
 Trumpeted at the blue sky
 In long streaks of sound molten metal
 The vine declares itself
 Clangfrom its red and yellow trumpets
 Clangfrom its long nasal trumpets
 Splitting the sunlight into ribbons tattered and shot with noise

 I sit in the cool arbour in a greenandgold twilight
 It is very still for I cannot hear the trumpets
 I only know that they are red and open
 And that the sun above the arbour shakes with heat
 My quill is newly mended
 And makes finedrawn lines with its point
 Down the long white paper it makes little lines
 Just linesupdowncrisscross
 My heart is strained out at the pinpoint of my quill
 It is thin and writhing like the marks of the pen
 My hand marches to a squeaky tune
 It marches down the paper to a squealing of fifes
 My pen and the trumpetflowers
 And Washingtons armies away over the smoketree to the Southwest
 Yankee Doodle my Darling It is you against the British
 Marching in your ragged shoes to batter down King George
 What have you got in your hat Not a feather I wager
 Just a haystraw for it is the harvest you are fighting for
 Hay in your hat and the whites of their eyes for a target
 Like Bunker Hill two years ago when I watched all day from the housetop
 Through Fathers spyglass
 The red city and the blue bright water
 And puffs of smoke which you made
 Twenty miles away
 Round by Cambridge or over the Neck
 But the smoke was whitewhite
 Today the trumpetflowers are redred
 And I cannot see you fighting
 But old Mr Dimond has fled to Canada
 And Myra sings Yankee Doodle at her milking
 The red throats of the trumpets bray and clang in the sunshine
 And the smoketree puffs dun blossoms into the blue air

 The City of Falling Leaves

 Leaves fall
 Brown leaves
 Yellow leaves streaked with brown
 They fall
 Flutter
 Fall again
 The brown leaves
 And the streaked yellow leaves
 Loosen on their branches
 And drift slowly downwards
 One
 One two three
 One two five
 All Venice is a falling of Autumn leaves
 Brown
 And yellow streaked with brown

 That sonnet Abate
 Beautiful
 I am quite exhausted by it
 Your phrases turn about my heart
 And stifle me to swooning
 Open the window I beg
 Lord What a strumming of fiddles and mandolins
 Tis really a shame to stop indoors
 Call my maid or I will make you lace me yourself
 Fie how hot it is not a breath of air
 See how straight the leaves are falling
 Marianna I will have the yellow satin caught up with silver fringe
 It peeps out delightfully from under a mantle
 Am I well painted today caro Abate mio
 You will be proud of me at the Ridotto hey
 Proud of being Cavalier Servente to such a lady
 Can you doubt it Bellissima Contessa
 A pinch more rouge on the right cheek
 And Venus herself shines less
 You bore me Abate
 I vow I must change you
 A letter Achmet
 Run and look out of the window Abate
 I will read my letter in peace
 The little black slave with the yellow satin turban
 Gazes at his mistress with strained eyes
 His yellow turban and black skin
 Are gorgeousbarbaric
 The yellow satin dress with its silver flashings
 Lies on a chair
 Beside a black mantle and a black mask
 Yellow and black
 Gorgeousbarbaric
 The lady reads her letter
 And the leaves drift slowly
 Past the long windows
 How silly you look my dear Abate
 With that great brown leaf in your wig
 Pluck it off I beg you
 Or I shall die of laughing

 A yellow wall
 Aflare in the sunlight
 Chequered with shadows
 Shadows of vine leaves
 Shadows of masks
 Masks coming printing themselves for an instant
 Then passing on
 More masks always replacing them
 Masks with tricorns and rapiers sticking out behind
 Pursuing masks with plumes and high heels
 The sunlight shining under their insteps
 One
 One two
 One two three
 There is a thronging of shadows on the hot wall
 Filigreed at the top with moving leaves
 Yellow sunlight and black shadows
 Yellow and black
 Gorgeousbarbaric
 Two masks stand together
 And the shadow of a leaf falls through them
 Marking the wall where they are not
 From hattip to shouldertip
 From elbow to swordhilt
 The leaf falls
 The shadows mingle
 Blur together
 Slide along the wall and disappear
 Gold of mosaics and candles
 And night blackness lurking in the ceiling beams
 Saint Marks glitters with flames and reflections
 A cloak brushes aside
 And the yellow of satin
 Licks out over the coloured inlays of the pavement
 Under the gold crucifixes
 There is a meeting of hands
 Reaching from black mantles
 Sighing embraces bold investigations
 Hide in confessionals
 Sheltered by the shuffling of feet
 Gorgeousbarbaric
 In its mail of jewels and gold
 Saint Marks looks down at the swarm of black masks
 And outside in the palace gardens brown leaves fall
 Flutter
 Fall
 Brown
 And yellow streaked with brown

 Blueblack the sky over Venice
 With a pricking of yellow stars
 There is no moon
 And the waves push darkly against the prow
 Of the gondola
 Coming from Malamocco
 And streaming toward Venice
 It is black under the gondola hood
 But the yellow of a satin dress
 Glares out like the eye of a watching tiger
 Yellow compassed about with darkness
 Yellow and black
 Gorgeousbarbaric
 The boatman sings
 It is Tasso that he sings
 The lovers seek each other beneath their mantles
 And the gondola drifts over the lagoon aslant to the coming dawn
 But at Malamocco in front
 In Venice behind
 Fall the leaves
 Brown
 And yellow streaked with brown
 They fall
 Flutter
 Fall





BRONZE TABLETS




The Fruit Shop



 Crossribboned shoes a muslin gown
 Highwaisted girdled with bright blue
 A straw poke bonnet which hid the frown
 She pluckered her little brows into
 As she picked her dainty passage through
 The dusty street Ah Mademoiselle
 A dirty pathway we need rain
 My poor fruits suffer and the shell
 Of this nuts too big for its kernel lain
 Here in the sun it has shrunk again
 The baker down at the corner says
 We need a battle to shake the clouds
 But I am a man of peace my ways
 Dont look to the killing of men in crowds
 Poor fellows with guns and bayonets for shrouds
 Pray Mademoiselle come out of the sun
 Let me dust off that wicker chair Its cool
 In here for the green leaves I have run
 In a curtain over the door make a pool
 Of shade You see the pears on that stool
 The shadow keeps them plump and fair
 Over the fruiterers door the leaves
 Held back the sun a greenish flare
 Quivered and sparked the shop the sheaves
 Of sunbeams glanced from the sign on the eaves
 Shot from the golden letters broke
 And splintered to little scattered lights
 Jeanne Tourmont entered the shop her poke
 Bonnet tilted itself to rights
 And her face looked out like the moon on nights
 Of flickering clouds Monsieur Popain I
 Want gooseberries an apple or two
 Or excellent plums but not if theyre high
 Havent you some which a strong wind blew
 Ive only a couple of francs for you
 Monsieur Popain shrugged and rubbed his hands
 What could he do the times were sad
 A couple of francs and such demands
 And asking for fruits a little bad
 Windblown indeed He never had
 Anything else than the very best
 He pointed to baskets of blunted pears
 With the thin skin tight like a bursting vest
 All yellow and red and brown in smears
 Monsieur Popains voice denoted tears
 He took up a pear with tender care
 And pressed it with his hardened thumb
 Smell it Mademoiselle the perfume there
 Is like lavender and sweet thoughts come
 Only from having a dish at home
 And those grapes They melt in the mouth like wine
 Just a click of the tongue and they burst to honey
 Theyre only this morning off the vine
 And I paid for them down in silver money
 The Corporals widow is witness her pony
 Brought them in at sunrise today
 Those orangesGold Theyre almost red
 They seem little chips just broken away
 From the sun itself Or perhaps instead
 Youd like a pomegranate theyre rarely gay
 When you split them the seeds are like crimson spray
 Yes theyre high theyre high and those Turkey figs
 They all come from the South and Nelsons ships
 Make it a little hard for our rigs
 They must be forever giving the slips
 To the cursed English and when men clips
 Through powder to bring them why dainties mounts
 A bit in price Those almonds now
 Ill strip off that husk when one discounts
 A life or two in a nigger row
 With the man who grew them it does seem how
 They would come dear and then the fight
 At sea perhaps our boats have heels
 And mostly they sail along at night
 But once in a way theyre caught one feels
 Ivorys not better nor finerwhy peels
 From an almond kernel are worth two sous
 Its hard to sell them now he sighed
 Purses are tight but I shall not lose
 Theres plenty of cheaper things to choose
 He picked some currants out of a wide
 Earthen bowl They make the tongue
 Almost fly out to suck them bride
 Currants they are they were planted long
 Ago for some new Marquise among
 Other great beauties before the Chateau
 Was left to rot Now the Gardeners wife
 He that marched off to his death at Marengo
 Sells them to me she keeps her life
 From snuffing out with her pruning knife
 Shes a poor old thing but she learnt the trade
 When her man was young and the young Marquis
 Couldnt have enough garden The flowers he made
 All new And the fruits But twas said that he
 Was no friend to the people and so they laid
 Some charge against him a cavalcade
 Of citizens took him away they meant
 Well but I think there was some mistake
 He just pottered round in his garden bent
 On growing things we were so awake
 In those days for the New Republics sake
 Hes gone and the garden is all thats left
 Not in ruin but the currants and apricots
 And peaches furred and sweet with a cleft
 Full of morning dew in those greenglazed pots
 Why Mademoiselle there is never an eft
 Or worm among them and as for theft
 How the old woman keeps them I cannot say
 But theyre finer than any grown this way
 Jeanne Tourmont drew back the filigree ring
 Of her striped silk purse tipped it upside down
 And shook it two coins fell with a ding
 Of striking silver beneath her gown
 One rolled the other lay a thing
 Sparked white and sharply glistening
 In a drop of sunlight between two shades
 She jerked the purse took its empty ends
 And crumpled them toward the centre braids
 The whole collapsed to a mass of blends
 Of colours and stripes Monsieur Popain friends
 We have always been In the days before
 The Great Revolution my aunt was kind
 When you needed help You need no more
 Tis we now who must beg at your door
 And will you refuse The little man
 Bustled denied his heart was good
 But times were hard He went to a pan
 And poured upon the counter a flood
 Of pungent raspberries tanged like wood
 He took a melon with rough green rind
 And rubbed it well with his apron tip
 Then he hunted over the shop to find
 Some walnuts cracking at the lip
 And added to these a barberry slip
 Whose acrid oval berries hung
 Like fringe and trembled He reached a round
 Basket with handles from where it swung
 Against the wall laid it on the ground
 And filled it then he searched and found
 The francs Jeanne Tourmont had let fall
 Youll return the basket Mademoiselle
 She smiled The next time that I call
 Monsieur You know that very well
 Twas lightly said but meant to tell
 Monsieur Popain bowed somewhat abashed
 She took her basket and stepped out
 The sunlight was so bright it flashed
 Her eyes to blindness and the rout
 Of the little street was all about
 Through glare and noise she stumbled dazed
 The heavy basket was a care
 She heard a shout and almost grazed
 The panels of a chaise and pair
 The postboy yelled and an amazed
 Face from the carriage window gazed
 She jumped back just in time her heart
 Beating with fear Through whirling light
 The chaise departed but her smart
 Was keen and bitter In the white
 Dust of the street she saw a bright
 Streak of colours wet and gay
 Red like blood Crushed but fair
 Her fruit stained the cobbles of the way
 Monsieur Popain joined her there
 Tiens Mademoiselle
 cest le General Bonaparte partant pour la Guerre




Malmaison



I

How the slates of the roof sparkle in the sun over there over there
beyond the high wall How quietly the Seine runs in loops and windings
over there over there sliding through the green countryside Like
ships of the line stately with canvas the tall clouds pass along the
sky over the glittering roof over the trees over the looped and
curving river A breeze quivers through the lindentrees Roses bloom
at Malmaison Roses Roses But the road is dusty Already the
Citoyenne Beauharnais wearies of her walk Her skin is chalked and
powdered with dust she smells dust and behind the wall are roses
Roses with smooth open petals poised above rippling leaves Roses
 They have told her so The Citoyenne Beauharnais shrugs her
shoulders and makes a little face She must mend her pace if she would
be back in time for dinner Roses indeed The guillotine more likely


The tiered clouds float over Malmaison and the slate roof sparkles in
the sun


II

Gallop Gallop The General brooks no delay Make way good people
and scatter out of his path you and your hens and your dogs and your
children The General is returned from Egypt and is come in a
caleche and four to visit his new property Throw open the gates
you Porter of Malmaison Pull off your cap my man this is your
master the husband of Madame Faster Faster A jerk and a jingle
and they are arrived he and she Madame has red eyes Fie It is for
joy at her husbands return Learn your place Porter A gentleman
here for two months Fie Fie then Since when have you taken to
gossiping Madame may have a brother I suppose Thatall green and
red and glitter with flesh as dark as ebonythat is a slave a
bloodthirsty stabbing slashing heathen come from the hot countries to
cure your tongue of idle whispering


A fine afternoon it is with tall bright clouds sailing over the trees


Bonaparte mon ami the trees are golden like my star the star I
pinned to your destiny when I married you The gypsy you remember her
prophecy My dear friend not here the servants are watching send them
away and that flashing splendour Roustan SuperbImperial but
 My dear your arm is trembling I faint to feel it touching me No
no Bonaparte not thatspare me thatdid we not bury that last
night You hurt me my friend you are so hot and strong Not long
Dear no thank God not long

The looped river runs saffron for the sun is setting It is getting
dark Dark Darker In the moonlight the slate roof shines palely
milkily white

The roses have faded at Malmaison nipped by the frost What need for
roses Smooth open petalsher arms Fragrant outcurved
petalsher breasts He rises like a sun above her stooping to touch
the petals press them wider Eagles Bees What are they to open
roses A little shivering breeze runs through the lindentrees and the
tiered clouds blow across the sky like ships of the line stately with
canvas


III

The gates stand wide at Malmaison stand wide all day The gravel of
the avenue glints under the continual rolling of wheels An officer
gallops up with his sabre clicking a mameluke gallops down with his
charger kicking Valets de pied run about in ones and twos and
groups like swirled blown leaves Tramp Tramp The guard is
changing and the grenadiers off duty lounge out of sight ranging along
the roads toward Paris

The slate roof sparkles in the sun but it sparkles milkily vaguely
the great glasshouses put out its shining Glass stone and onyx now
for the suns mirror Much has come to pass at Malmaison New rocks and
fountains blocks of carven marble fluted pillars uprearing antique
temples vases and urns in unexpected places bridges of stone bridges
of wood arbours and statues and a flood of flowers everywhere new
flowers rare flowers parterre after parterre of flowers Indeed the
roses bloom at Malmaison It is youth youth untrammeled and advancing
trundling a country ahead of it as though it were a hoop Laughter and
spur janglings in tessellated vestibules Tripping of clocked and
embroidered stockings in little lowheeled shoes over smooth
grassplots India muslins spangled with silver patterns slide
through treesmingleseparatewhite day fireflies flashing
moonbrilliance in the shade of foliage

The kangaroos I vow Captain I must see the kangaroos

As you please dear Lady but I recommend the shady linden alley and
feeding the cockatoos

They say that Madame Bonapartes breed of sheep is the best in all
France

And oh have you seen the enchanting little cedar she planted when the
First Consul sent home the news of the victory of Marengo

Picking choosing the chattering company flits to and fro Over the
trees the great clouds go tiered stately like ships of the line
bright with canvas

Prisonersbase and its swooping veering racing giggling bumping
The First Consul runs plump into M de Beauharnais and falls But he
picks himself up smartly and starts after M Isabey Too late M Le
Premier Consul Mademoiselle Hortense is out after you Quickly my
dear Sir Stir your short legs she is swift and eager and as graceful
as her mother She is there that other playing too but lightly
warily bearing herself with care rather floating out upon the air than
running never far from goal She is there borne up above her guests
as something indefinably fair a rose above periwinkles A blown rose
smooth as satin reflexed one loosened petal hanging back and down A
rose that undulates languorously as the breeze takes it resting upon
its leaves in a faintness of perfume


There are rumours about the First Consul Malmaison is full of women
and Paris is only two leagues distant Madame Bonaparte stands on the
wooden bridge at sunset and watches a black swan pushing the pink and
silver water in front of him as he swims crinkling its smoothness into
pleats of changing colour with his breast Madame Bonaparte presses
against the parapet of the bridge and the crushed roses at her belt
melt petal by petal into the pink water


IV

A vile day Porter But keep your wits about you The Empress will
soon be here Queer without the Emperor It is indeed but best not
consider that Scratch your head and prick up your ears Divorce is not
for you to debate about She is late Ah well the roads are muddy
The rain spears are as sharp as whetted knives They dart down and down
edged and shining Cloptrop Cloptrop A carriage grows out of the
mist Hist Porter You can keep on your hat It is only Her Majestys
dogs and her parrot Cloptrop The Ladies in Waiting Porter
Cloptrop It is Her Majesty At least I suppose it is but the
blinds are drawn

In all the years I have served Her Majesty she never before passed the
gate without giving me a smile

Youre a droll fellow to expect the Empress to put out her head in the
pouring rain and salute you She has affairs of her own to think about

Clang the gate no need for further waiting nobody else will be coming
to Malmaison tonight


White under her veil drained and shaking the woman crosses the
antechamber Empress Empress Foolish splendour perished to dust
Ashes of roses ashes of youth Empress forsooth

Over the glass domes of the hothouses drenches the rain Behind her a
clock ticksticks again The sound knocks upon her thought with the
echoing shudder of hollow vases She places her hands on her ears but
the minutes pass knocking Tears in Malmaison And years to come each
knocking by minute after minute Years many years and tears and
cold pouring rain

I feel as though I had died and the only sensation I have is that I am
no more

Rain Heavy thudding rain


V

The roses bloom at Malmaison And not only roses Tulips myrtles
geraniums camelias rhododendrons dahlias double hyacinths All the
year through under glass under the sky flowers bud expand die and
give way to others always others From distant countries they have
been brought and taught to live in the cool temperateness of France
There is the Bonapartea from Peru the Napoleone Imperiale the
Josephinia Imperatrix a pearlwhite flower purpleshadowed the
calix pricked out with crimson points Malmaison wears its flowers as a
lady wears her gems flauntingly assertively Malmaison decks herself
to hide the hollow within

The glasshouses grow and grow and every year fling up hotter
reflections to the sailing sun

The cost runs into millions but a woman must have something to console
herself for a broken heart One can play backgammon and patience and
then patience and backgammon and stake gold napoleons on each game won
Sport truly It is an unruly spirit which could ask better With her
jewels her laces her shawls her two hundred and twenty dresses her
fichus her veils her pictures her busts her birds It is absurd
that she cannot be happy The Emperor smarts under the thought of her
ingratitude What could he do more And yet she spends spends as never
before It is ridiculous Can she not enjoy life at a smaller figure
Was ever monarch plagued with so extravagant an exwife She owes her
chocolatemerchant her candlemerchant her sweetmeat purveyor her
grocer her butcher her poulterer her architect and the shopkeeper
who sells her rouge her perfumer her dressmaker her merchant of
shoes She owes for fans plants engravings and chairs She owes
masons and carpenters vintners lingeres The ladys affairs are in
sad confusion

And why Why

Can a river flow when the spring is dry


Night The Empress sits alone and the clock ticks one after one The
clock nicks off the edges of her life She is chipped like an old bit
of china she is frayed like a garment of last years wearing She is
soft crinkled like a fading rose And each minute flows by brushing
against her shearing off another and another petal The Empress crushes
her breasts with her hands and weeps And the tall clouds sail over
Malmaison like a procession of stately ships bound for the moon


Scarlet clearblue purple epauletted with gold It is a parade of
soldiers sweeping up the avenue Eight horses eight Imperial
harnesses four caparisoned postilions a carriage with the Emperors
arms on the panels Ho Porter pop out your eyes and no wonder Where
else under the Heavens could you see such splendour

They sit on a stone seat The little man in the green coat of a Colonel
of Chasseurs and the lady beautiful as a satin seedpod and as pale
The house has memories The satin seedpod holds his germs of Empire
We will stay here under the blue sky and the turreted white clouds She
draws him he feels her faded loveliness urge him to replenish it Her
soft transparent texture woos his nervous fingering He speaks to her
of debts of resignation of her children and his he promises that she
shall see the King of Rome he says some harsh things and some pleasant
But she is there close to him rose toned to amber white shot with
violet pungent to his nostrils as embalmed roseleaves in a twilit
room

Suddenly the Emperor calls his carriage and rolls away across the
looping Seine


VI

Crystalblue brightness over the glasshouses Crystalblue streaks and
ripples over the lake A macaw on a gilded perch screams they have
forgotten to take out his dinner The windows shake Boom Boom It
is the rumbling of Prussian cannon beyond Pecq Roses bloom at
Malmaison Roses Roses Swimming above their leaves rotting beneath
them Fallen flowers strew the unraked walks Fallen flowers for a
fallen Emperor The General in charge of him draws back and watches
Snatches of musicsnarling sneering music of bagpipes They say a
Scotch regiment is besieging SaintDenis The Emperor wipes his face
or is it his eyes His tired eyes which see nowhere the grace they long
for Josephine Somebody asks him a question he does not answer
somebody else does that There are voices but one voice he does not
hear and yet he hears it all the time Josephine The Emperor puts up
his hand to screen his face The white light of a bright cloud spears
sharply through the lindentrees Vive lEmpereur There are troops
passing beyond the wall troops which sing and call Boom A pink rose
is jarred off its stem and falls at the Emperors feet

Very well I go Where Does it matter There is no sword to
clatter Nothing but soft brushing gravel and a gate which shuts with a
click

Quick fellow dont spare your horses

A whip cracks wheels turn why burn ones eyes following a fleck of
dust


VII

Over the slate roof tall clouds like ships of the line pass along the
sky The glasshouses glitter splotchily for many of their lights are
broken Roses bloom fiery cinders quenching under damp weeds Wreckage
and misery and a trailing of petty deeds smearing over old
recollections

The musty rooms are empty and their shutters are closed only in the
gallery there is a stuffed black swan covered with dust When you
touch it the feathers come off and float softly to the ground Through
a chink in the shutters one can see the stately clouds crossing the sky
toward the Roman arches of the Marly Aqueduct




The Hammers

 Frindsbury Kent 1786

 Bang
 Bang
 Tap
 Tapatap Rap
 All through the lead and silver Winter days
 All through the copper of Autumn hazes
 Tap to the red rising sun
 Tap to the purple setting sun
 Four years pass before the job is done
 Two thousand oak trees grown and felled
 Two thousand oaks from the hedgerows of the Weald
 Sussex had yielded two thousand oaks
 With huge boles
 Round which the tape rolls
 Thirty mortal feet say the village folks
 Two hundred loads of elm and Scottish fir
 Planking from Dantzig
 My What timber goes into a ship
 Tap Tap
 Two years they have seasoned her ribs on the ways
 Tapping tapping
 You can hear though theres nothing where you gaze
 Through the fog down the reaches of the river
 The tapping goes on like heartbeats in a fever
 The churchbells chime
 Hours and hours
 Dropping days in showers
 Bang Rap Tap
 Go the hammers all the time
 They have planked up her timbers
 And the nails are driven to the head
 They have decked her over
 And again and again
 The shoringup beams shudder at the strain
 Black and blue breeches
 Pigtails bound and shining
 Like ants crawling about
 The hull swarms with carpenters running in and out
 Joiners calkers
 And they are all terrible talkers
 Jem Wilson has been to sea and he tells some wonderful tales
 Of whales and spice islands
 And pirates off the Barbary coast
 He boasts magnificently with his mouth full of nails
 Stephen Pibold has a tenor voice
 He shifts his quid of tobacco and sings
 The second in command was bleareyed Ned
 While the surgeon his limb was alopping
 A ninepounder came and smack went his head
 Pull away pull away pull away I say
 Rare news for my Meg of Wapping
 Every Sunday
 People come in crowds
 After churchtime of course
 In curricles and gigs and wagons
 And some have brought cold chicken and flagons
 Of wine
 And beer in stoppered jugs
 Dear Dear But I tell ee twill be a fine ship
 Theres none finer in any of the slips at Chatham

 The third Summers roses have started in to blow
 When the fine stern carving is begun
 Flutings and twinings and long slow swirls
 Bits of deal shaved away to thin spiral curls
 Tap Tap A cornucopia is nailed into place
 Rapatap They are putting up a railing filigreed like Irish lace
 The Three Towns people never saw such grace
 And the paint on it The richest gold leaf
 Why the glitter when the sun is shining passes belief
 And that row of glass windows tipped toward the sky
 Are rubies and carbuncles when the day is dry
 Oh my Oh my
 They have coppered up the bottom
 And the copper nails
 Stand about and sparkle in big wooden pails
 Bang Clash Bang
 And he swiggd and Nick swiggd
 And Ben swiggd and Dick swiggd
 And I swiggd and all of us swiggd it
 And swore there was nothing like grog
 It seems they sing
 Even though coppering is not an easy thing
 What a splendid specimen of humanity is a true British workman
 Say the people of the Three Towns
 As they walk about the dockyard
 To the sound of the evening churchbells
 And so artistic too each one tells his neighbour
 What immense taste and labour
 Miss Jessie Prime in a pink silk bonnet
 Titters with delight as her eyes fall upon it
 When she steps lightly down from Lawyer Greens whisky
 Such amazing beauty makes one feel frisky
 She explains
 Mr Nichols says he is delighted
 He is the firm
 His work is all requited
 If Miss Jessie can approve
 Miss Jessie answers that the ship is a love
 The sides are yellow as marigold
 The portlids are red when the ports are up
 Bloodred squares like an even chequer
 Of yellow asters and portulaca
 There is a wide black strake at the waterline
 And above is a blue like the sky when the weather is fine
 The inner bulwarks are painted red
 Why asks Miss Jessie Tis a horrid note
 Mr Nichols clears his throat
 And tells her the launching day is set
 He says Be careful the paint is wet
 But Miss Jessie has touched it her sprigged muslin gown
 Has a bloodred streak from the shoulder down
 It looks like blood says Miss Jessie with a frown

 Tap Tap Rap
 An October day with waves running in bluewhite lines and a capful of wind
 Three broad flags ripple out behind
 Where the masts will be
 Royal Standard at the main
 Admiralty flag at the fore
 Union Jack at the mizzen
 The hammers tap harder faster
 They must finish by noon
 The last nail is driven
 But the wind has increased to half a gale
 And the ship shakes and quivers upon the ways
 The Commissioner of Chatham Dockyard is coming
 In his tenoared barge from the Kings Stairs
 The Marines band will play God Save Great George Our King
 And there is to be a dinner afterwards at the Crown with speeches
 The wind screeches and flaps the flags till they pound like hammers
 The wind hums over the ship
 And slips round the dogshores
 Jostling them almost to falling
 There is no time now to wait for Commissioners and marine bands
 Mr Nichols has a bottle of port in his hands
 He leans over holding his hat and shouts to the men below
 Let her go
 Bang Bang Pound
 The dogshores fall to the ground
 And the ship slides down the greased planking
 A splintering of glass
 And port wine running all over the white and copper stem timbers
 Success to his Majestys ship the Bellerophon
 And the red wine washes away in the waters of the Medway

 Paris March 1814

 Fine yellow sunlight down the rue du Mont Thabor
 Ten oclock striking from all the clocktowers of Paris
 Over the door of a shop in gilt letters
 MartinParfumeur and something more
 A large gilded wooden something
 Listen What a ringing of hammers
 Tap
 Tap
 Squeak
 Tap Squeak Tapatap
 Blaise
 Oui Msieu
 Dont touch the letters My name stays
 Bien Msieu
 Just take down the eagle and the shield with the bees
 As Msieu pleases
 Tap Squeak Tap
 The man on the ladder hammers steadily for a minute or two
 Then stops
 He Patron
 They are fastened well Nom dun Chien
 What if I break them
 Break away
 You and Paul must have them down today
 Bien
 And the hammers start again
 Drumbeating at the something of gilded wood
 Sunshine in a golden flood
 Lighting up the yellow fronts of houses
 Glittering each window to a flash
 Squeak Squeak Tap
 The hammers beat and rap
 A Prussian hussar on a grey horse goes by at a dash
 From other shops the noise of striking blows
 Pounds thumps and whacks
 Wooden sounds splinterscracks
 Paris is full of the galloping of horses and the knocking of hammers
 Hullo Friend Martin is business slack
 That you are in the street this morning Dont turn your back
 And scuttle into your shop like a rabbit to its hole
 Ive just been taking a stroll
 The stinking Cossacks are bivouacked all up and down the Champs Elysees
 I cant get the smell of them out of my nostrils
 Dirty fellows who dont believe in frills
 Like washing Ah mon vieux youd have to go
 Out of business if you lived in Russia So
 Weve given up being perfumers to the Emperor have we
 Blaise
 Be careful of the hen
 Maybe I can find a use for her one of these days
 That eagles rather well cut Martin
 But Im sick of smelling Cossack
 Take me inside and let me put my head into a stack
 Of orrisroot and musk
 Within the shop the light is dimmed to a pearlandgreen dusk
 Out of which dreamily sparkle counters and shelves of glass
 Containing phials and bowls and jars and dishes a mass
 Of aqueous transparence made solid by threads of gold
 Gold and glass
 And scents which whiff across the green twilight and pass
 The perfumer sits down and shakes his head
 Always the same Monsieur Antoine
 You artists are wonderful folk indeed
 But Antoine Vernet does not heed
 He is reading the names on the bottles and bowls
 Done in fine gilt letters with wonderful scrolls
 What have we here Eau Imperial Odontalgique
 I must say mon cher your names are chic
 But it wont do positively it will not do
 Elba doesnt count Ah here is another
 Baume du Commandeur Thats better He needs something to smother
 Regrets A little lubricant too
 Might be useful I have it
 Sage Oil perhaps hell be good now with it well submit
 This fine German rouge I fear he is pale
 Monsieur Antoine dont rail
 At misfortune He treated me well and fairly
 And you prefer him to Bourbons admit it squarely
 Heaven forbid Bang Whack
 Squeak Squeak Crack
 CRASH
 Oh Lord Martin That shield is hash
 The whole street is covered with golden bees
 They look like so many yellow peas
 Lying there in the mud Id like to paint it
 Plum pudding of Empire Thats rather quaint it
 Might take with the Kings Shall I try Oh Sir
 You distress me you do Poor old Martins purr
 But he hasnt a scratch in him I know
 Now let us get back to the powders and patches
 Foolish man
 The Kings are here now We must hit on a plan
 To change all these titles as fast as we can
 Bouquet Imperatrice Tut Tut Give me some ink
 Bouquet de la Reine what do you think
 Not the same receipt
 Now Martin put away your conceit
 Who will ever know
 Extract of Nobilityexcellent since most of them are killed
 But Monsieur Antoine
 You are selfwilled
 Martin You need a salve
 For your conscience do you
 Very well well halve
 The compliments also the pastes and dentifrices
 Send some to the Kings and some to the Empresses
 Oil of Bitter Almondsthe Empress Josephine can have that
 Oil of Parma Violets fits the other one pat
 Rap Rap Bang
 What a hideous clatter
 Blaise seems determined to batter
 That poor old turkey into bits
 And pound to jelly my excellent wits
 Come come Martin you mustnt shirk
 The night cometh soonetc Dont jerk
 Me up like that Essence de la Valliere
 That has a charmingly Bourbon air
 And oh Magnificent Listen to this
 Vinaigre des Quatre Voleurs Nothing amiss
 With thatEngland Austria Russia and Prussia
 Martin youre a wonder
 Upheavals of continents cant keep you under
 Monsieur Antoine I am grieved indeed
 At such levity What France has gone through
 Very true Martin very true
 But never forget that a man must feed
 Pound Pound Thump
 Pound
 Look here in another minute Blaise will drop that bird on the ground
 Martin shrugs his shoulders Ah well what then
 Antoine with a laugh Ill give you two sous for that antiquated hen
 The Imperial Eagle sells for two sous
 And the lilies go up
 A man must choose

 Paris April 1814

 Cold impassive the marble arch of the Place du Carrousel
 Haughty contemptuous the marble arch of the Place du Carrousel
 Like a woman raped by force rising above her fate
 Borne up by the cold rigidity of hate
 Stands the marble arch of the Place du Carrousel
 Tap Clinkatink
 Tap Rap Chink
 What falls to the ground like a streak of flame
 Hush It is only a bit of bronze flashing in the sun
 What are all those soldiers Those are not the uniforms of France
 Alas No The uniforms of France Great Imperial France are done
 They will rot away in chests and hang to dusty tatters in barn lofts
 These are other armies And their name
 Hush be still for shame
 Be still and imperturbable like the marble arch
 Another bright spark falls through the blue air
 Over the Place du Carrousel a wailing of despair
 Crowd your horses back upon the people Uhlans and Hungarian Lancers
 They see too much
 Unfortunately Gentlemen of the Invading Armies what they do not see
 they hear
 Tap Clinkatink
 Tap
 Another sharp spear
 Of brightness
 And a ringing of quick metal lightness
 On hard stones
 Workmen are chipping off the names of Napoleons victories
 From the triumphal arch of the Place du Carrousel

 Do they need so much force to quell the crowd
 An old Grenadier of the line groans aloud
 And each hammer tap points the sob of a woman
 Russia Prussia Austria and the fadedwhitelily Bourbon king
 Think it well
 To guard against tumult
 A mob is an undependable thing
 Ding Ding
 Vienna is scattered all over the Place du Carrousel
 In glittering bent and twisted letters
 Your betters have clattered over Vienna before
 Officer of his Imperial Majesty our FatherinLaw
 Tink Tink
 A workmans chisel can strew you to the winds
 Munich
 Do they think
 To pleasure Paris used to the fall of cities
 By giving her a fall of letters

 It is a month too late
 One month and our lilywhite Bourbon king
 Has done a colossal thing
 He has curdled love
 And soured the desires of a people
 Still the letters fall
 The workmen creep up and down their ladders like lizards on a wall
 Tap Tap Tink
 Clink Clink
 Oh merciful God they will not touch Austerlitz
 Strike me blind my God my eyes can never look on that
 I would give the other leg to save it it took one
 Curse them Curse them Aim at his hat
 Give me the stone Why didnt you give it to me
 I would not have missed Curse him
 Curse all of them They have got the A
 Ding Ding
 I saw the Terror but I never saw so horrible a thing as this
 Vive lEmpereur Vive lEmpereur
 Dont strike him Fritz
 The mob will rise if you do
 Just run him out to the quai
 That will get him out of the way
 They are almost through
 Clink Tink Ding
 Clear as the sudden ring
 Of a bell
 Z strikes the pavement
 Farewell Austerlitz Tilsit Presbourg
 Farewell greatness departed
 Farewell Imperial honours knocked broadcast by the beating hammers
 of ignorant workmen
 Straight in the Spring moonlight
 Rises the deflowered arch
 In the silence shining bright
 She stands naked and unsubdued
 Her marble coldness will endure the march
 Of decades
 Rend her bronzes hammers
 Cast down her inscriptions
 She is unconquerable austere
 Cold as the moon that swims above her
 When the nights are clear

 Croissy IledeFrance June 1815

 Whoa Victorine
 Devil take the mare Ive never seen so vicious a beast
 She kicked Jules the last time she was here
 Hes been lame ever since poor chap
 Rap Tap
 Tapatapatap Tap Tap
 Id rather be lame than dead at Waterloo Msieu Charles
 Sacre Bleu Dont mention Waterloo and the damned grinning British
 We didnt run in the old days
 There wasnt any running at Jena
 Those were decent days
 And decent men who stood up and fought
 We never got beaten because we wouldnt be
 See
 You would have taught them wouldnt you Sergeant Boignet
 But today its everyone for himself
 And the Emperor isnt what he was
 How the Devil do you know that
 If he was beaten the cause
 Is the green geese in his army led by traitors
 Oh I say no names Monsieur Charles
 You neednt hammer so loud
 If there are any spies lurking behind the bellows
 I beg they come out Dirty fellows
 The old Sergeant seizes a redhot poker
 And advances brandishing it into the shadows
 The rows of horses flick
 Placid tails
 Victorine gives a savage kick
 As the nails
 Go in Tap Tap
 Jules draws a horseshoe from the fire
 And beats it from red to peacockblue and black
 Purpling darker at each whack
 Ding Dang Dong
 Dingadingdong
 It is a long time since any one spoke
 Then the blacksmith brushes his hand over his eyes
 Well he sighs
 Hes broke
 The Sergeant charges out from behind the bellows
 Its the green geese I tell you
 Their hearts are all whites and yellows
 Theres no red in them Red
 Thats what we want Fouche should be fed
 To the guillotine and all Paris dance the carmagnole
 That would breed jolly fine lickbloods
 To lead his armies to victory
 Ancient history Sergeant
 Hes done
 Say that again Monsieur Charles and Ill stun
 You where you stand for a dungeating Royalist
 The Sergeant gives the poker a savage twist
 He is as purple as the cooling horseshoes
 The air from the bellows creaks through the flues
 Tap Tap The blacksmith shoes Victorine
 And through the doorway a fine sheen
 Of leaves flutters with the sun between
 By a spurt of fire from the forge
 You can see the Sergeant with swollen gorge
 Puffing and gurgling and choking
 The bellows keep on croaking
 They wheeze
 And sneeze
 Creak Bang Squeeze
 And the hammer strokes fall like buzzing bees
 Or pattering rain
 Or faster than these
 Like the hum of a waterfall struck by a breeze
 Clank from the bellowschain pulled up and down
 Clank
 And sunshine twinkles on Victorines flank
 Starting it to blue
 Dropping it to black
 Clack Clack
 Tapatap Tap
 Lord What galloping Some mishap
 Is making that man ride so furiously
 Francois you
 Victorine wont be through
 For another quarter of an hour As you hope to die
 Work faster man the order has come
 What order Speak out Are you dumb
 A chaise without arms on the panels at the gate
 In the far sidewall and just to wait
 We must be there in half an hour with swift cattle
 Youre a stupid fool if you dont hear that rattle
 Those are German guns Cant you guess the rest
 Nantes Rochefort possibly Brest
 Tap Tap as though the hammers were mad
 Dang Ding Creak The farriers lad
 Jerks the bellows till he cracks their bones
 And the stifled air hiccoughs and groans
 The Sergeant is lying on the floor
 Stone dead and his hat with the tricolore
 Cockade has rolled off into the cinders Victorine snorts and lays back
 her ears
 What glistens on the anvil Sweat or tears

 St Helena May 1821

 Tap Tap Tap
 Through the white tropic night
 Tap Tap
 Beat the hammers
 Unwearied indefatigable
 They are hanging dull black cloth about the dead
 Lustreless black cloth
 Which chokes the radiance of the moonlight
 And puts out the little moving shadows of leaves
 Tap Tap
 The knocking makes the candles quaver
 And the long black hangings waver
 Tap Tap Tap
 Tap Tap
 In the ears which do not heed
 Tap Tap
 Above the eyelids which do not flicker
 Tap Tap
 Over the hands which do not stir
 Chiselled like a cameo of white agate against the hangings
 Struck to brilliance by the falling moonlight
 A face
 Sharp as a frozen flame
 Beautiful as an altar lamp of silver
 And still Perfectly still
 In the next room the men chatter
 As they eat their midnight lunches
 A knife hits against a platter
 But the figure on the bed
 Between the stifling black hangings
 Is cold and motionless
 Played over by the moonlight from the windows
 And the indistinct shadows of leaves

 Tap Tap
 Upholsterer Darling has a fine shop in Jamestown
 Tap Tap
 Andrew Darling has ridden hard from Longwood to see to the work in his shop
 in Jamestown
 He has a corps of men in it toiling and swearing
 Knocking and measuring and planing and squaring
 Working from a chart with figures
 Comparing with their rules
 Setting this and that part together with their tools
 Tap Tap Tap
 Haste indeed
 So great is the need
 That carpenters have been taken from the new church
 Joiners have been called from shaping pews and lecterns
 To work of greater urgency
 Coffins
 Coffins is what they are making this bright Summer morning
 Coffinsand all to measurement
 There is a tin coffin
 A deal coffin
 A lead coffin
 And Captain Bennetts best mahogany diningtable
 Has been sawed up for the grand outer coffin
 Tap Tap Tap
 Sunshine outside in the square
 But inside only hollow coffins and the tapping upon them
 The men whistle
 And the coffins grow under their hammers
 In the darkness of the shop
 Tap Tap Tap

 Tramp of men
 Steady tramp of men
 Sliteyed Chinese with long pigtails
 Bearing oblong things upon their shoulders
 March slowly along the road to Longwood
 Their feet fall softly in the dust of the road
 Sometimes they call gutturally to each other and stop to shift shoulders
 Four coffins for the little dead man
 Four fine coffins
 And one of them Captain Bennetts diningtable
 And sixteen splendid Chinamen all strong and able
 And of assured neutrality
 Ah George of England Lord Bathhurst  Co
 Your princely munificence makes ones heart glow
 Huzza Huzza For the Lion of England

 Tap Tap Tap
 Marble likeness of an Emperor
 Dead man who burst your heart against a world too narrow
 The hammers drum you to your last throne
 Which always you shall hold alone
 Tap Tap
 The glory of your past is faded as a sunset fire
 Your day lingers only like the tones of a windlyre
 In a twilit room
 Here is the emptiness of your dream
 Scattered about you
 Coins of yesterday
 Double napoleons stamped with Consul or Emperor
 Strange as those of Herculaneum
 And you just dead
 Not one spool of thread
 Will these buy in any marketplace
 Lay them over him
 They are the baubles of a crown of mist
 Worn in a vision and melted away at waking
 Tap Tap
 His heart strained at kingdoms
 And now it is content with a silver dish
 Strange World Strange Wayfarer
 Strange Destiny
 Lower it gently beside him and let it lie

Two Travellers in the Place Vendome

 Reign of Louis Philippe



 A great tall column spearing at the sky
 With a little man on top Goodness Tell me why
 He looks a silly thing enough to stand up there so high

 What a strange fellow like a soldier in a play
 Tightfitting coat with the tails cut away
 Highcrowned hat which the brims overlay

 Twohorned hat makes an outline like a bow
 Must have a sword I can see the light glow
 Between a dark line and his leg Vertigo

 I get gazing up at him a pygmy flashed with sun
 A weathercock or scarecrow or both things in one
 As bright as a jewelled crown hung above a throne

 Say what is the use of him if he doesnt turn
 Just put up to glitter there like a torch to burn
 A sort of sacrificial show in a lofty urn

 But why a little soldier in an obsolete dress
 Id rather see a Goddess with a spear I confess
 Something allegorical and fine Why yes

 I cannot take my eyes from him I dont know why at all
 Ive looked so long the whole thing swims I feel he ought to fall
 Foreshortened there among the clouds hes pitifully small

 What do you say There used to be an Emperor standing there
 With flowing robes and laurel crown Really Yet I declare
 Those spiral battles round the shaft dont seem just his affair

 A togaed laurelled mans I mean Now this chap seems to feel
 As though he owned those soldiers Whew How he makes one reel
 Swinging round above his circling armies in a wheel

 Sweeping round the sky in an orbit like the suns
 Flashing sparks like cannonballs from his own long guns
 Perhaps my sight is tired but that figure simply stuns

 How low the houses seem and all the people are mere flies
 That fellow pokes his hat up till it scratches on the skies
 Impudent Audacious But by Jove he blinds the eyes





WAR PICTURES




The Allies

August 14th 1914



Into the brazen burnished sky the cry hurls itself The zigzagging
cry of hoarse throats it floats against the hard winds and binds the
head of the serpent to its tail the long snailslow serpent of marching
men Men weighed down with rifles and knapsacks and parching with war
The cry jars and splits against the brazen burnished sky

This is the war of wars and the cause Has this writhing worm of men a
cause

Crackling against the polished sky is an eagle with a sword The eagle
is red and its head is flame


In the shoulder of the worm is a teacher

His tongue laps the warsucked air in drought but he yells defiance at
the redeyed eagle and in his ears are the bells of new philosophies
and their tinkling drowns the sputter of the burning sword He shrieks
God damn you When you are broken the word will strike out new
shoots

His boots are tight the sun is hot and he may be shot but he is in
the shoulder of the worm


A dust speck in the worms belly is a poet

He laughs at the flaring eagle and makes a long nose with his fingers
He will fight for smooth white sheets of paper and uncurdled ink The
sputtering sword cannot make him blink and his thoughts are wet and
rippling They cool his heart

He will tear the eagle out of the sky and give the earth tranquillity
and loveliness printed on white paper


The eye of the serpent is an owner of mills

He looks at the glaring sword which has snapped his machinery and struck
away his men

But it will all come again when the sword is broken to a million dying
stars and there are no more wars


Bankers butchers shopkeepers painters farmersmen sway and
sweat They will fight for the earth for the increase of the slow sure
roots of peace for the release of hidden forces They jibe at the
eagle and his scorching sword

One TwoOne Twoclump the heavy boots The cry hurtles
against the sky

Each man pulls his belt a little tighter and shifts his gun to make it
lighter Each man thinks of a woman and slaps out a curse at the
eagle The sword jumps in the hot sky and the worm crawls on to the
battle stubbornly

This is the war of wars from eye to tail the serpent has one cause
PEACE




The Bombardment



Slowly without force the rain drops into the city It stops a moment
on the carved head of Saint John then slides on again slipping and
trickling over his stone cloak It splashes from the lead conduit of a
gargoyle and falls from it in turmoil on the stones in the Cathedral
square Where are the people and why does the fretted steeple sweep
about in the sky Boom The sound swings against the rain Boom
again After it only water rushing in the gutters and the turmoil
from the spout of the gargoyle Silence Ripples and mutters Boom


The room is damp but warm Little flashes swarm about from the
firelight The lustres of the chandelier are bright and clusters of
rubies leap in the bohemian glasses on the etagere Her hands are
restless but the white masses of her hair are quite still Boom Will
it never cease to torture this iteration Boom The vibration
shatters a glass on the etagere It lies there formless and glowing
with all its crimson gleams shot out of pattern spilled flowing red
bloodred A thin bellnote pricks through the silence A door creaks
The old lady speaks Victor clear away that broken glass Alas
Madame the bohemian glass Yes Victor one hundred years ago my
father brought it Boom The room shakes the servitor quakes
Another goblet shivers and breaks Boom


It rustles at the windowpane the smooth streaming rain and he is
shut within its clash and murmur Inside is his candle his table his
ink his pen and his dreams He is thinking and the walls are pierced
with beams of sunshine slipping through young green A fountain tosses
itself up at the blue sky and through the spattered water in the basin
he can see copper carp lazily floating among cold leaves A windharp
in a cedartree grieves and whispers and words blow into his brain
bubbled iridescent shooting up like flowers of fire higher and
higher Boom The flameflowers snap on their slender stems The
fountain rears up in long broken spears of dishevelled water and
flattens into the earth Boom And there is only the room the table
the candle and the sliding rain Again BoomBoomBoom He
stuffs his fingers into his ears He sees corpses and cries out in
fright Boom It is night and they are shelling the city Boom
Boom


A child wakes and is afraid and weeps in the darkness What has made
the bed shake Mother where are you I am awake Hush my
Darling I am here But Mother something so queer happened the
room shook Boom Oh What is it What is the matter Boom
Where is Father I am so afraid Boom The child sobs and shrieks
The house trembles and creaks Boom


Retorts globes tubes and phials lie shattered All his trials oozing
across the floor The life that was his choosing lonely urgent
goaded by a hope all gone A weary man in a ruined laboratory that is
his story Boom Gloom and ignorance and the jig of drunken brutes
Diseases like snakes crawling over the earth leaving trails of slime
Wails from people burying their dead Through the window he can see
the rocking steeple A ball of fire falls on the lead of the roof and
the sky tears apart on a spike of flame Up the spire behind the
lacings of stone zigzagging in and out of the carved tracings squirms
the fire It spouts like yellow wheat from the gargoyles coils round
the head of Saint John and aureoles him in light It leaps into the
night and hisses against the rain The Cathedral is a burning stain on
the white wet night


Boom The Cathedral is a torch and the houses next to it begin to
scorch Boom The bohemian glass on the etagere is no longer there
Boom A stalk of flame sways against the red damask curtains The old
lady cannot walk She watches the creeping stalk and counts
BoomBoomBoom


The poet rushes into the street and the rain wraps him in a sheet of
silver But it is threaded with gold and powdered with scarlet beads
The city burns Quivering spearing thrusting lapping streaming run
the flames Over roofs and walls and shops and stalls Smearing its
gold on the sky the fire dances lances itself through the doors and
lisps and chuckles along the floors


The child wakes again and screams at the yellow petalled flower
flickering at the window The little red lips of flame creep along the
ceiling beams


The old man sits among his broken experiments and looks at the burning
Cathedral Now the streets are swarming with people They seek shelter
and crowd into the cellars They shout and call and over all slowly
and without force the rain drops into the city Boom And the steeple
crashes down among the people Boom Boom again The water rushes
along the gutters The fire roars and mutters Boom




Lead Soldiers



The nursery fire burns brightly crackling in cheerful little explosions
and trails of sparks up the back of the chimney Miniature rockets
peppering the black bricks with golden stars as though a gala flamed a
night of victorious wars

The nodding mandarin on the bookcase moves his head forward and back
slowly and looks into the air with his bluegreen eyes He stares into
the air and nodsforward and back The red rose in his hand is a
crimson splash on his yellow coat Forward and back and his bluegreen
eyes stare into the air and he nodsnods


 Tommys soldiers march to battle
 Trumpets flare and snaredrums rattle
 Bayonets flash and sabres glance
 How the horses snort and prance
 Cannon drawn up in a line
 Glitter in the dizzy shine
 Of the morning sunlight Flags
 Ripple colours in great jags
 Red blows out then blue then green
 Then all threea weaving sheen
 Of prismed patriotism March
 Tommys soldiers stiff and starch
 Boldly stepping to the rattle
 Of the drums they go to battle


Tommy lies on his stomach on the floor and directs his columns He puts
his infantry in front and before them ambles a mounted band Their
instruments make a strand of gold before the scarlettunicked soldiers
and they take very long steps on their little green platforms and from
the ranks bursts the song of Tommys soldiers marching to battle The
song jolts a little as the green platforms stick on the thick carpet
Tommy wheels his guns round the edge of a box of blocks and places a
squad of cavalry on the commanding eminence of a footstool


The fire snaps pleasantly and the old Chinaman nodsnods The fire
makes the red rose in his hand glow and twist Hist That is a bold
song Tommys soldiers sing as they march along to battle

Crack Rattle The sparks fly up the chimney


 Tommys armys off to war
 Not a soldier knows what for
 But he knows about his rifle
 How to shoot it and a trifle
 Of the proper thing to do
 When its he who is shot through
 Like a cleverly trained flea
 He can follow instantly
 Orders and some quick commands
 Really make severe demands
 On a mind thats none too rapid
 Leaden brains tend to the vapid
 But how beautifully dressed
 Is this army How impressed
 Tommy is when at his heel
 All his baggage wagons wheel
 About the patterned carpet and
 Moving up his heavy guns
 He sees them glow with diamond suns
 Flashing all along each barrel
 And the gold and blue apparel
 Of his gunners is a joy
 Tommy is a lucky boy
 Boom Boom Tara

The old mandarin nods under his purple umbrella The rose in his hand
shoots its petals up in thin quills of crimson Then they collapse and
shrivel like red embers The fire sizzles


Tommy is galloping his cavalry two by two over the floor They must
pass the open terror of the door and gain the enemy encamped under the
washstand The mounted band is very grand playing allegro and leading
the infantry on at the double quick The tassel of the hearthrug has
flung down the bassdrum and he and his dapplegrey horse lie
overtripped slipped out of line with the little lead drumsticks
glistening to the fires shine

The fire burns and crackles and tickles the tripped bassdrum with its
sparkles

The marching army hitches its little green platforms valiantly and
steadily approaches the door The overturned bassdrummer lying on the
hearthrug melting in the heat softens and sheds tears The song
jeers at his impotence and flaunts the glory of the martial and still
upstanding vaunting the deeds it will do For are not Tommys soldiers
all bright and new


 Tommys leaden soldiers we
 Glittering with efficiency
 Not a buttons out of place
 Tons and tons of golden lace
 Wind about our officers
 Every manly bosom stirs
 At the thought of killingkilling
 Tommys dearest wish fulfilling
 We are gaudy savage strong
 And our loins so ripe we long
 First to kill then procreate
 Doubling so the laws of Fate
 On their women we have sworn
 To graft our sons And overborne
 Theyll rear us younger soldiers so
 Shall our race endure and grow
 Waxing greater in the wombs
 Borrowed of them while damp tombs
 Rot their men O Glorious War
 Goad us with your points Great Star



The china mandarin on the bookcase nods slowly forward and
backforward and backand the red rose writhes and wriggles
thrusting its flaming petals under and over one another like tortured
snakes

The fire strokes them with its dartles and purrs at them and the old
man nods


Tommy does not hear the song He only sees the beautiful new
gailycoloured lead soldiers They belong to him and he is very proud
and happy He shouts his orders aloud and gallops his cavalry past the
door to the washstand He creeps over the floor on his hands and knees
to one battalion and another but he sees only the bright colours of his
soldiers and the beautiful precision of their gestures He is a lucky
boy to have such fine lead soldiers to enjoy


Tommy catches his toe in the leg of the washstand and jars the
pitcher He snatches at it with his hands but it is too late The
pitcher falls and as it goes he sees the white water flow over its
lip It slips between his fingers and crashes to the floor But it is
not water which oozes to the door The stain is glutinous and dark a
spark from the firelight heads it to red In and out between the fine
new soldiers licking over the carpet squirms the stream of blood
lapping at the little green platforms and flapping itself against the
painted uniforms


The nodding mandarin moves his head slowly forward and back The rose
is broken and where it fell is black blood The old mandarin leers
under his purple umbrella and nodsforward and back staring into
the air with bluegreen eyes Every time his head comes forward a
rosebud pushes between his lips rushes into full bloom and drips to
the ground with a splashing sound The pool of black blood grows and
grows with each dropped rose and spreads out to join the stream from
the washstand The beautiful army of lead soldiers steps boldly
forward but the little green platforms are covered in the rising stream
of blood


The nursery fire burns brightly and flings fanbursts of stars up the
chimney as though a gala flamed a night of victorious wars




The Painter on Silk



 There was a man
 Who made his living
 By painting roses
 Upon silk

 He sat in an upper chamber
 And painted
 And the noises of the street
 Meant nothing to him

 When he heard bugles and fifes and drums
 He thought of red and yellow and white roses
 Bursting in the sunshine
 And smiled as he worked

 He thought only of roses
 And silk
 When he could get no more silk
 He stopped painting
 And only thought
 Of roses

 The day the conquerors
 Entered the city
 The old man
 Lay dying
 He heard the bugles and drums
 And wished he could paint the roses
 Bursting into sound




A Ballad of Footmen



 Now what in the name of the sun and the stars
 Is the meaning of this most unholy of wars

 Do men find life so full of humour and joy
 That for want of excitement they smash up the toy

 Fifteen millions of soldiers with popguns and horses
 All bent upon killing because their of courses

 Are not quite the same All these men by the ears
 And nine nations of women choking with tears

 It is folly to think that the will of a king
 Can force men to make ducks and drakes of a thing

 They value and life is at least one supposes
 Of some little interest even if roses

 Have not grown up between one foot and the other
 What a marvel bureaucracy is which can smother

 Such quite elementary feelings and tag
 A man with a number and set him to wag

 His legs and his arms at the word of command
 Or the blow of a whistle Hes certainly damned

 Fit only for mincemeat if a little gold lace
 And an upturned moustache can set him to face

 Bullets and bayonets and death and diseases
 Because some one he calls his Emperor pleases

 If each man were to lay down his weapon and say
 With a click of his heels I wish you Goodday

 Now what may I ask could the Emperor do
 A king and his minions are really so few

 Angry Oh of course a most furious Emperor
 But the men are so many they need not mind his temper or

 The dire results which could not be inflicted
 With no one to execute sentence convicted

 Is just the weak wind from an old broken bellows
 What lackeys men are who might be such fine fellows

 To be killing each other unmercifully
 At an order as though one said Bring up the tea

 Or is it that tasting the blood on their jaws
 They lap at it drunk with its ferment and laws

 So patiently builded are nothing to drinking
 More blood any blood They dont notice its stinking

 I dont suppose tigers do fighting cocks sparrows
 And as to menwhat are men when their marrows

 Are running with blood they have gulped it is plain
 Such excellent sport does not recollect pain

 Toll the bells in the steeples left standing Halfmast
 The flags which meant order for order is past

 Take the dust of the streets and sprinkle your head
 The civilization weve worked for is dead

 Squeeze into this archway the head of the line
 Has just swung round the corner to Die Wacht am Rhein





THE OVERGROWN PASTURE




Reaping



 You want to know whats the matter with me do yer
 My aint men blindern moles
 It aint nothin new be sure o that
 Why ef youd had eyes youd ha seed
 Me changin under your very nose
 Each day a little diffrent
 But you never see nothin you dont
 Dont touch me Jake
 Dont you darst to touch me
 I aint in no humour
 Thats whats come over me
 Jest a change clear through
 You lay still an Ill tell yer
 Ive had it on my mind to tell yer
 Fer some time
 Its a strain livin a lie from mornin till night
 An Im goin to put an end to it right now
 An dont make any mistake about one thing
 When I married yer I loved yer
 Why your voice ud make
 Me go hot and cold all over
 An your kisses most stopped my heart from beatin
 Lord I was a silly fool
 But thats the way twas
 Well I married yer
 An thought Heavn was comin
 To set on the doorstep
 Heavn didnt do no settin
 Though the first year warnt so bad
 The babys fever threw you off some I guess
 An then I took her death real hard
 An a mopey wife kind o disgusts a man
 I aint blamin yer exactly
 But thats how twas
 Do lay quiet
 I know Im slow but its harder to say n I thought
 There come a time when I got to be
 More wife agin than mother
 The mother part was sort of a waste
 When we didnt have no other child
 But youd got used ter lots o things
 An you was all took up with the farm
 Manys the time Ive laid awake
 Watchin the moon go clear through the elmtree
 Out o sight
 Id foller yer around like a dog
 An set in the chair youd ben settin in
 Jest to feel its arms around me
 So longs I didnt have yours
 It preyed on me I guess
 Longin and longin
 While you was busy all day and snorin all night
 Yes I know youre wide awake now
 But now aint then
 An I guess youll think diffrent
 When Im done
 Do you mind the day you went to Hadrock
 I didnt want to stay home for reasons
 But you said someone d have to be here
 Cause Elmer was comin to see t th telephone
 An you never see why I was so set on goin with yer
 Our married life hadnt ben any great shakes
 Still marriage is marriage an I was raised Godfearin
 But Lord you didnt notice nothin
 An Elmer hangin around all Winter
 Twas a lovely mornin
 The appletrees was jest elegant
 With their blossoms all flared out
 An there warnt a cloud in the sky
 You went you wouldnt pay no tention to what I said
 An I heard the Ford chuggin for most a mile
 The air was so still
 Then Elmer come
 Its no use your frettin Jake
 Ill tell you all about it
 I know what Im doin
 An whats worse I know what I done
 Elmer fixed th telephone in about two minits
 An he didnt seem in no hurry to go
 An I dont know as I wanted him to go either
 I was awful mad at your not takin me with yer
 An I was tired o wishin and wishin
 An gittin no comfort
 I guess it aint necessary to tell yer all the things
 He stayed to dinner
 An he helped me do the dishes
 An he said a home was a fine thing
 An I said dishes warnt a home
 Nor yet the room theyre in
 He said a lot o things
 An I fended him off at first
 But he got talkin all around me
 Clost up to the things Id ben thinkin
 Whats the use o me goin on Jake
 You know
 He got all he wanted
 An I give it to him
 An whats more Im glad
 I aint dead anyway
 An somebody thinks Im somethin
 Keep away Jake
 You can kill me tomorrer if you want to
 But Im goin to have my say
 Funny thing Guess I aint made to hold a man
 Elmer aint ben here for morn two months
 I dont want to pretend nothin
 Mebbe if hed ben lately
 I shouldnt have told yer
 Ill go away in the mornin o course
 What you want the light fer
 I dont look no diffrent
 Aint the moon bright enough
 To look at a woman thats deceived yer by
 Dont Jake dont you cant love me now
 It aint a question of forgiveness
 Why Id be thinkin o Elmer evry minute
 It aint decent
 Oh my God It aint decent any more either way

 An have a mind to listen
 Thers somethin Id like ter speak about
 I aint never mentioned it
 But Id like to tell yer fore I go
 Would you mind lowerin them shades
 Fall twilights awful grey
 An that fires real cosy with the shades drawed
 Well I guess folks about here think Ive ben dretful onsociable
 You neednt say taint so cause I know diffrent
 An whats more its true
 Well the reason is Ive ben scared out o my life
 Scared evry minit o th time fer eight year
 Eight mortal year tis come next June
 Twas on the eighteenth o June
 Six months after Id buried my husband
 That somethin happened ter me
 Mebbe youll mind that afore that
 I was a cheery body
 Hiram was too
 Alays liked to ask a neighbor in
 An evn when he died
 Barrin low sperrits I warnt averse to seein nobody
 But that eighteenth o June changed evrythin
 I was doin most o th farmwork myself
 With jest a hired boy Clarence King twas
 Comin in fer an hour or two
 Well that eighteenth o June
 I was goin round
 Lockin up and seein to things fore I went to bed
 I was jest steppin out t th barn
 Goin round outside stead o through the shed
 Cause there was such a sight o moonlight
 Somehow or another I thought twould be pretty outdoors
 I got settled for pretty things that night I guess
 I aint stuck on em no more
 Well them laylock bushes side o th house
 Was real lovely
 Glittrin and shakin in the moonlight
 An the smell o them rose right up
 An most took my breath away
 The colour o the spikes was all faded out
 They never keep their colour when the moons on em
 But the smell fair toxicated me
 I was alays partial to a sweet scent
 An I went close up t th bushes
 Sos to put my face right into a flower
 Mis Priest jests I got breathin in that laylock bloom
 I saw layin right at my feet
 A mans hand
 It was as whites the side o th house
 And sparklin like that lumnous paint they put on gateposts
 I screamed right out
 I couldnt help it
 An I could hear my scream
 Goin over an over
 In that echo beind th barn
 Hearin it agin an agin like that
 Scared me so I darsnt scream any more
 I jest stood ther
 And looked at that hand
 I thought the echod begin to hammer like my heart
 But it didnt
 There was only th wind
 Sighin through the laylock leaves
 An slappin em up agin the house
 Well I guess I looked at that hand
 Most ten minits
 An it never moved
 Jest lay there white as white
 After a while I got to thinkin that o course
 Twas some drunken tramp over from Redfield
 That calmed me some
 An I commenced to think Id better git him out
 From under them laylocks
 I planned to drag him in t th barn
 An lock him in ther till Clarence come in th mornin
 I got so mad thinkin o that allfired brazen tramp
 Asleep in my laylocks
 I jest stooped down and grabbed th hand and give it an awful pull
 Then I bumped right down settin on the ground
 Mis Priest ther warnt no body come with the hand
 No it aint cold its jest that I cant abear thinkin of it
 Evn now
 Ill take a sip o tea
 Thank you Mis Priest thats better
 Id ruther finish now Ive begun
 Thank you jest the same
 I dropped the hands ef itd ben red hot
 Stead o ice cold
 Fer a minit or two I jest laid on that grass
 Pantin
 Then I up and run to them laylocks
 An pulled em every which way
 True es Im settin here Mis Priest
 Ther warnt nothin ther
 I peeked an pryed all about em
 But ther warnt no man ther
 Neither livin nor dead
 But the hand was ther all right
 Upside down the way Id dropped it
 And glistnin fit to dazzle yer
 I dont know how I done it
 An I dont know why I done it
 But I wanted to git that dretful hand out o sight
 I got in t th barn somehow
 An felt roun till I got a spade
 I couldnt stop fer a lantern
 Besides the moonlight was bright enough in all conscience
 Then I scooped that awful thing up in th spade
 I had a sight o trouble doin it
 It slid off and tipped over and I couldnt bear
 Evn to touch it with my foot to prop it
 But I done it somehow
 Then I carried it off beind the barn
 Clost to an old appletree
 Where you couldnt see from the house
 An I buried it
 Good an deep

 I dont reclect nothin more o that night
 Clarence woke me up in th mornin
 Hollerin fer me to come down and set th milk
 When hed gone
 I stole roun to the appletree
 And seed the earth all new turned
 Where I left it in my hurry
 I did a heap o gardenin
 That mornin
 I couldnt cut no big sods
 Fear Clarence would notice and ask me what I wanted em fer
 So I got teeny bits o turf here and ther
 And no one couldnt tell therd ben any diggin
 When I got through
 They was awful days after that Mis Priest
 I used ter go every mornin and poke about them bushes
 An up and down the fence
 Ter find the body that hand come off of
 But I couldnt never find nothin
 Id lay awake nights
 Hearin them laylocks blowin and whiskin
 At last I had Clarence cut em down
 An make a big bonfire of em
 I told him the smell made me sick
 An that warnt no lie
 I cant abear the smell on em now
 An no wonder es you say
 I fretted somethin awful bout that hand
 I wondered could it be Hirams
 But folks dont rob graveyards hereabouts
 Besides Hirams hands warnt that awful starin white
 I give up seein people
 I was afeared Id say somethin
 You know what folks thought o me
 Bettern I do I dessay
 But mebbe now youll see I couldnt do nothin diffrent
 But I stuck it out
 I warnt goin to be downed
 By no loose hand no matter how it come ther
 But that aint the worst Mis Priest
 Not by a long ways
 Two year ago Mr Densmore made me an offer for Cherrys Orchard
 Well Id got used to th thought o bein sort o blighted
 An I warnt scared no more
 Lived down my fear I guess
 Id kinder got used to th thought o that awful night
 And I didnt mope much about it
 Only I never went out o doors by moonlight
 That stuck
 Well when Mr Densmores offer come
 I started thinkin bout the place
 An all the things that had gone on ther
 Thinks I I guess Ill go and see where I put the hand
 I was foolhardy with the long time that had gone by
 I knowd the place real well
 Fer Id put it right in between two o the apple roots
 I dont know what possessed me Mis Priest
 But I kinder wanted to know
 That the hand had been flesh and bone anyway
 It had sorter bothered me thinkin I might ha imagined it
 I took a mornin when the sun was real pleasant and warm
 I guessed I wouldnt jump for a few old bones
 But I did jump somethin wicked
 Ther warnt no bones
 Ther warnt nothin
 Not evn the gold ring Id minded bein on the little finger
 I dont know ef ther ever was anythin
 Ive worried myself sick over it
 I ben diggin and diggin day in and day out
 Till Clarence ketched me at it
 Oh I knowd real well what you all thought
 An I aint sayin youre not right
 But I aint goin to end in no county sylum
 If I cn help it
 The shivrin fits come on me sudden like
 I know em dont you trouble
 Ive fretted considerable about the sylum
 I guess I ben frettin all the time I aint ben diggin
 But anyhow I cant dig to Chicago can I
 Thank you Mis Priest
 Im better now I only dropped in in passin
 Ill jest be steppin along down to Frenchs
 No I wont be seein nobody in the mornin
 Its a pretty early start
 Dont you stand ther Mis Priest
 The windll blow yer lamp out
 An I cn see easy I got aholt o the gate now
 I aint a mite tired thank you
 Goodnight

 They knowd real well twas me

 Ketchin me in the woods as they did
 An me in my house dress
 Folks dont walk miles an miles
 In the drifted snow
 With no hat nor wrap on em
 Ef everythins all right I guess
 All right Ha Ha Ha
 Nothin warnt right with me
 Never was
 Oh Lord Why did I do it
 Why aint it yesterday and Ed here agin
 Manys the time Ive set up with him nights
 When he had cramps or rheumatizm or somethin
 I used ter nurse him sames ef he was a baby
 I wouldnt hurt him I love him
 Dont you dare to say I killed him Twarnt me
 Somethin got aholt o me I couldnt help it
 Oh what shall I do What shall I do
 Yes Sir
 No Sir
 I beg your pardon II
 Oh Im a wicked woman
 An Im desolate desolate
 Why warnt I struck dead or paralyzed
 Afore my hands done it
 Oh my God what shall I do
 No Sir ther aint no extenuatin circumstances
 An I dont want none
 I want a bolt o lightnin
 To strike me dead right now
 Oh Ill tell yer
 But it wont make no diffrence
 Nothin will
 Yes I killed him
 Why do yer make me say it
 Its cruel Cruel
 I killed him because o th silence
 The long long silence
 That watched all around me
 And he wouldnt break it
 I tried to make him
 Time an agin
 But he was terrible taciturn Ed was
 He never spoke cept when he had to
 An then hed only say yes and no
 You cant even guess what that silence was
 Id hear it whisperin in my ears
 An I got frightened twas so thick
 An alays comin back
 Ef Ed would ha talked sometimes
 It would ha driven it away
 But he never would
 He didnt hear it same as I did
 You see Sir
 Our farm was offn the main road
 And set away back under the mountain
 And the village was seven mile off
 Measurin after youd got out o our lane
 We didnt have no hired man
 Cept in hayin time
 An Danes place
 That was the nearest
 Was clear way tother side the mountain
 They used Marley postoffice
 An ours was Benton
 Ther was a carttrack took yer to Danes in Summer
 An it warnt above two mile that way
 But it warnt never broke out Winters
 I used to dread the Winters
 Seems ef I couldnt abear to see the goldenrod bloomin
 Winterd come so quick after that
 You dont know what snows like when yer with it
 Day in an day out
 Ed would be out all day loggin
 An I set at home and look at the snow
 Layin over everythin
 It ud dazzle me blind
 Till it warnt white any more but black as ink
 Then the quiet ud commence rushin past my ears
 Till I most went mad listenin to it
 Manys the time Ive dropped a pan on the floor
 Jest to hear it clatter
 I was most frantic when dinnertime come
 An Ed was back from the woods
 Id ha give my soul to hear him speak
 But hed never say a word till I asked him
 Did he like the raised biscuits or whatever
 An then sometimes hed jest nod his answer
 Then hed go out agin
 An Id watch him from the kitchin winder
 It seemed the woods come marchin out to meet him
 An the trees ud press round him an hustle him
 I got so I was scared o th trees
 I thought they come nearer
 Every day a little nearer
 Closin up round the house
 I never went in t th woods Winters
 Though in Summer I liked em well enough
 It warnt so bad when my little boy was with us
 He used to go sleddin and skatin
 An every day his father fetched him to school in the pung
 An brought him back agin
 We scraped an scraped fer Neddy
 We wanted him to have a education
 We sent him to High School
 An then he went up to Boston to Technology
 He was a minin engineer
 An doin real well
 A credit to his bringin up
 But his very first position ther was an explosion in the mine
 And Im glad Im glad
 He aint here to see me now
 Neddy Neddy
 Im your mother still Neddy
 Dont turn from me like that
 I cant abear it I cant I cant
 What did you say
 Oh yes Sir
 Im here
 Im very sorry
 I dont know what Im sayin
 No Sir
 Not till after Neddy died
 Twas the next Winter the silence come
 I dont remember noticin it afore
 That was five year ago
 An its been gittin worse an worse
 I asked Ed to put in a telephone
 I thought ef I felt the whisperin comin on
 I could ring up some o th folks
 But Ed wouldnt hear of it
 He said wed paid so much for Neddy
 We couldnt hardly git along as twas
 An he never understood me wantin to talk
 Well this year was worsen all the others
 We had a terrible spell o stormy weather
 An the snow lay so thick
 You couldnt see the fences even
 Out o doors was as flat as the palm o my hand
 Ther warnt a hump or a holler
 Fer as you could see
 It was so quiet
 The snappin o the branches back in the woodlot
 Sounded like pistol shots
 Ed was out all day
 Same as usual
 An it seemed he talked lessn ever
 He didnt even say Goodmornin once or twice
 An jest nodded or shook his head when I asked him things
 On Monday he said hed got to go over to Benton
 Fer some oats
 Id oughter ha gone with him
 But twas washin day
 An I was afeared the fine weatherd break
 An I couldnt do my dryin
 All my life Id done my work punctual
 An I couldnt fix my conscience
 To go junketin on a washinday
 I cant tell you what that day was to me
 It dragged an dragged
 Fer ther warnt no Ed ter break it in the middle
 Fer dinner
 Every time I stopped stirrin the water
 I heerd the whisperin all about me
 I stopped oftenern I should
 To see ef twas still ther
 An it alays was
 An gittin louder
 It seemed ter me
 Once I threw up the winder to feel the wind
 That seemed most alive somehow
 But the woods looked so kind of menacin
 I closed it quick
 An started to mangles hards I could
 The squeakin was comfortin
 Well Ed come home bout four
 I seen him down the road
 An I run out through the shed inter th barn
 To meet him quicker
 I hollered out Hullo
 But he didnt say nothin
 He jest drove right in
 An climbed out o th sleigh
 An commenced unharnessin
 I asked him a heap o questions
 Who hed seed
 An what hed done
 Once in a while hed nod or shake
 But most o th time he didnt do nothin
 Twas gittin dark then
 An I was in a state
 With the loneliness
 An Ed payin no attention
 Like somethin warnt livin
 All of a sudden it come
 I dont know what
 But I jest couldnt stand no more
 It didnt seem s though that was Ed
 An it didnt seem as though I was me
 I had to break a way out somehow
 Somethin was closin in
 An I was stiflin
 Eds loggin axe was ther
 An I took it
 Oh my God
 I cant see nothin else afore me all the time
 I run out inter th woods
 Seemed as ef they was pullin me
 An all the time I was wadin through the snow
 I seed Ed in front of me
 Where Id laid him
 An I see him now
 There There
 What you holdin me fer
 I want ter go to Ed
 Hes bleedin
 Stop holdin me
 I got to go
 Im comin Ed
 Ill be ther in a minit
 Oh Im so tired
 Faints





CLOCKS TICK A CENTURY




Nightmare A Tale for an Autumn Evening

 After a Print by George Cruikshank



 It was a gusty night
 With the wind booming and swooping
 Looping round corners
 Sliding over the cobblestones
 Whipping and veering
 And careering over the roofs
 Like a thousand clattering horses
 Mr Spruggins had been dining in the city
 Mr Spruggins was none too steady in his gait
 And the wind played ball with Mr Spruggins
 And laughed as it whistled past him
 It rolled him along the street
 With his little feet pitapatting on the flags of the sidewalk
 And his muffler and his coattails blown straight out behind him
 It bumped him against area railings
 And chuckled in his ear when he said Ouch
 Sometimes it lifted him clear off his little patting feet
 And bore him in triumph over three grey flagstones and a quarter
 The moon dodged in and out of clouds winking
 It was all very unpleasant for Mr Spruggins
 And when the wind flung him hard against his own front door
 It was a relief
 Although the breath was quite knocked out of him
 The gaslamp in front of the house flared up
 And the keyhole was as big as a barn door
 The gaslamp flickered away to a sputtering blue star
 And the keyhole went out with it
 Such a stabbing and jabbing
 And sticking and picking
 And poking and pushing and prying
 With that key
 And there is no denying that Mr Spruggins rapped out an oath or two
 Rubadubdubbing them out to a real snaredrum roll
 But the door opened at last
 And Mr Spruggins blew through it into his own hall
 And slammed the door to so hard
 That the knocker banged five times before it stopped
 Mr Spruggins struck a light and lit a candle
 And all the time the moon winked at him through the window
 Why couldnt you find the keyhole Spruggins
 Taunted the wind
 I can find the keyhole
 And the wind thin as a wire
 Darted in and seized the candle flame
 And knocked it over to one side
 And pummelled it downdowndown
 But Mr Spruggins held the candle so close that it singed his chin
 And ran and stumbled up the stairs in a surprisingly agile manner
 For the wind through the keyhole kept saying Spruggins Spruggins
 behind him
 The fire in his bedroom burned brightly
 The room with its crimson bed and window curtains
 Was as red and glowing as a carbuncle
 It was still and warm
 There was no wind here for the windows were fastened
 And no moon
 For the curtains were drawn
 The candle flame stood up like a pointed pear
 In a wide brass dish
 Mr Spruggins sighed with content
 He was safe at home
 The fire glowedred and yellow roses
 In the black basket of the grate
 And the bed with its crimson hangings
 Seemed a great peony
 Wide open and placid
 Mr Spruggins slipped off his topcoat and his muffler
 He slipped off his bottlegreen coat
 And his flowered waistcoat
 He put on a flannel dressinggown
 And tied a peaked nightcap under his chin
 He wound his large gold watch
 And placed it under his pillow
 Then he tiptoed over to the window and pulled back the curtain
 There was the moon dodging in and out of the clouds
 But behind him was his quiet candle
 There was the wind whisking along the street
 The window rattled but it was fastened
 Did the wind say Spruggins
 All Mr Spruggins heard was Sssss
 Dying away down the street
 He dropped the curtain and got into bed
 Martha had been in the last thing with the warmingpan
 The bed was warm
 And Mr Spruggins sank into feathers
 With the familiar ticking of his watch just under his head
 Mr Spruggins dozed
 He had forgotten to put out the candle
 But it did not make much difference as the fire was so bright
 Too bright
 The red and yellow roses pricked his eyelids
 They scorched him back to consciousness
 He tried to shift his position
 He could not move
 Something weighed him down
 He could not breathe
 He was gasping
 Pinned down and suffocating
 He opened his eyes
 The curtains of the window were flung back
 The fire and the candle were out
 And the room was filled with green moonlight
 And pressed against the windowpane
 Was a wide round face
 Winkingwinking
 Solemnly dropping one eyelid after the other
 Ticktockwent the watch under his pillow
 Winkwinkwent the face at the window
 It was not the fire roses which had pricked him
 It was the winking eyes
 Mr Spruggins tried to bounce up
 He could not because
 His heart flapped up into his mouth
 And fell back dead
 On his chest was a fat pink pig
 On the pig a blackamoor
 With a ten pound weight for a cap
 His mustachios kept curling up and down like angry snakes
 And his eyes rolled round and round
 With the pupils coming into sight and disappearing
 And appearing again on the other side
 The holsters at his saddlebow were two port bottles
 And a curved tableknife hung at his belt for a scimitar
 While a fork and a keg of spirits were strapped to the saddle behind
 He dug his spurs into the pig
 Which trampled and snorted
 And stamped its cloven feet deeper into Mr Spruggins
 Then the green light on the floor began to undulate
 It heaved and hollowed
 It rose like a tide
 Seagreen
 Full of claws and scales
 And wriggles
 The air above his bed began to move
 It weighed over him
 In a mass of draggled feathers
 Not one lifted to stir the air
 They drooped and dripped
 With a smell of port wine and brandy
 Closing down slowly
 Trickling drops on the bedquilt
 Suddenly the window fell in with a great scatter of glass
 And the moon burst into the room
 SizzlingSssssSpruggins Spruggins
 It rolled toward him
 A green ball of flame
 With two eyes in the center
 A red eye and a yellow eye
 Dropping their lids slowly
 One after the other
 Mr Spruggins tried to scream
 But the blackamoor
 Leapt off his pig
 With a cry
 Drew his scimitar
 And plunged it into Mr Sprugginss mouth

 Mr Spruggins got up in the cold dawn
 And remade the fire
 Then he crept back to bed
 By the light which seeped in under the window curtains
 And lay there shivering
 While the bells of St George the Martyr chimed the quarter after seven




The Paper Windmill



The little boy pressed his face against the windowpane and looked out
at the bright sunshiny morning The cobblestones of the square
glistened like mica In the trees a breeze danced and pranced and
shook drops of sunlight like falling golden coins into the brown water
of the canal Down stream slowly drifted a long string of galliots
piled with crimson cheeses The little boy thought they looked as if
they were rocs eggs blocks of big ruby eggs He said Oh with
delight and pressed against the window with all his might


The golden cock on the top of the Stadhuis gleamed His beak was open
like a pair of scissors and a narrow piece of blue sky was wedged in it
Cockadoodledo cried the little boy Cant you hear me through
the window Gold Cocky Cockadoodledo You should crow when you see
the eggs of your cousin the great roc But the golden cock stood
stock still with his fine tail blowing in the wind He could not
understand the little boy for he said Cocorico when he said anything
But he was hung in the air to swing not to sing His eyes glittered to
the bright West wind and the crimson cheeses drifted away down the
canal


It was very dull there in the big room Outside in the square the wind
was playing tag with some fallen leaves A man passed with a dogcart
beside him full of smart new milkcans They rattled out a gay tune
Tidditytumtiti Have some milk for your tea Cream for your coffee
to drink tonight thick and smooth and sweet and white and the
mans sabots beat an accompaniment Plop trop milk for your tea
Plop trop drink it tonight It was very pleasant out there but it
was lonely here in the big room The little boy gulped at a tear


It was queer how dull all his toys were They were so still Nothing
was still in the square If he took his eyes away a moment it had
changed The milkman had disappeared round the corner there was only
an old woman with a basket of green stuff on her head picking her way
over the shiny stones But the wind pulled the leaves in the basket
this way and that and displayed them to beautiful advantage The sun
patted them condescendingly on their flat surfaces and they seemed
sprinkled with silver The little boy sighed as he looked at his
disordered toys on the floor They were motionless and their colours
were dull The dark wainscoting absorbed the sun There was none left
for toys


The square was quite empty now Only the wind ran round and round it
spinning Away over in the corner where a street opened into the
square the wind had stopped Stopped running that is for it never
stopped spinning It whirred and whirled and gyrated and turned It
burned like a great coloured sun It hummed and buzzed and sparked
and darted There were flashes of blue and long smearing lines of
saffron and quick jabs of green And over it all was a sheen like a
myriad cut diamonds Round and round it went the huge windwheel and
the little boys head reeled with watching it The whole square was
filled with its rays blazing and leaping round after one another
faster and faster The little boy could not speak he could only gaze
staring in amaze


The windwheel was coming down the square Nearer and nearer it came a
great disk of spinning flame It was opposite the window now and the
little boy could see it plainly but it was something more than the wind
which he saw A man was carrying a huge fanshaped frame on his
shoulder and stuck in it were many little painted paper windmills each
one scurrying round in the breeze They were bright and beautiful and
the sight was one to please anybody and how much more a little boy who
had only stupid motionless toys to enjoy


The little boy clapped his hands and his eyes danced and whizzed for
the circling windmills made him dizzy Closer and closer came the
windmill man and held up his big fan to the little boy in the window of
the Ambassadors house Only a pane of glass between the boy and the
windmills They slid round before his eyes in rapidly revolving
splendour There were wheels and wheels of coloursbig little
thick thinall one clear perfect spin The windmill vendor dipped
and raised them again and the little boys face was glued to the
windowpane Oh What a glorious wonderful plaything Rings and rings
of windy colour always moving How had any one ever preferred those
other toys which never stirred Nursie come quickly Look I want a
windmill See It is never still You will buy me one wont you I
want that silver one with the big ring of blue


So a servant was sent to buy that one silver ringed with blue and
smartly it twirled about in the servants hands as he stood a moment to
pay the vendor Then he entered the house and in another minute he was
standing in the nursery door with some crumpled paper on the end of a
stick which he held out to the little boy But I wanted a windmill
which went round cried the little boy That is the one you asked
for Master Charles Nursie was a bit impatient she had mending to do
See it is silver and here is the blue But it is only a blue
streak sobbed the little boy I wanted a blue ring and this silver
doesnt sparkle Well Master Charles that is what you wanted now
run away and play with it for I am very busy


The little boy hid his tears against the friendly windowpane On the
floor lay the motionless crumpled bit of paper on the end of its stick
But far away across the square was the windmill vendor with his big
wheel of whirring splendour It spun round in a blaze like a whirling
rainbow and the sun gleamed upon it and the wind whipped it until it
seemed a maze of spattering diamonds Cocorico crowed the golden
cock on the top of the Stadhuis That is something worth crowing
for But the little boy did not hear him he was sobbing over the
crumpled bit of paper on the floor




The Red Lacquer MusicStand



 A musicstand of crimson lacquer long since brought
 In some fast clippership from China quaintly wrought
 With bossed and carven flowers and fruits in blackening gold
 The slender shaft all twined about and thickly scrolled
 With vine leaves and young twisted tendrils whirling curling
 Flinging their new shoots over the four wings and swirling
 Out on the three wide feet in golden lumps and streams
 Petals and apples in high relief and where the seams
 Are worn with handling through the polished crimson sheen
 Long streaks of black the under lacquer shine out clean
 Four desks adjustable to suit the heights of players
 Sitting to viols or standing up to sing four layers
 Of music to serve every instrument are there
 And on the apex a large flattopped golden pear
 It burns in red and yellow dusty smouldering lights
 When the sun flares the old barnchamber with its flights
 And skips upon the crystal knobs of dim sideboards
 Legless and mouldy and hops glint to glint on hoards
 Of scythes and spades and dinnerhorns so the old tools
 Are little candles throwing brightness round in pools
 With Oriental splendour red and gold the dust
 Covering its flames like smoke and thinning as a gust
 Of brighter sunshine makes the colours leap and range
 The strange old musicstand seems to strike out and change
 To stroke and tear the darkness with sharp golden claws
 To dart a forked vermilion tongue from open jaws
 To puff out bitter smoke which chokes the sun and fade
 Back to a still faint outline obliterate in shade
 Creeping up the ladder into the loft the Boy
 Stands watching very still prickly and hot with joy
 He sees the dusty sunmote slit by streaks of red
 He sees it split and stream and all about his head
 Spikes and spears of gold are licking pricking flicking
 Scratching against the walls and furniture and nicking
 The darkness into sparks chipping away the gloom
 The Boys nose smarts with the pungence in the room
 The wind pushes an elm branch from before the door
 And the sun widens out all along the floor
 Filling the barnchamber with white straightforward light
 So not one blurred outline can tease the mind to fright

 O All ye Works of the Lord Bless ye the Lord Praise Him and Magnify Him
 for ever
 O let the Earth Bless the Lord Yea let it Praise Him and Magnify Him
 for ever
 O ye Mountains and Hills Bless ye the Lord Praise Him and Magnify Him
 for ever
 O All ye Green Things upon the Earth Bless ye the Lord Praise Him
 and Magnify Him for ever

 The Boy will praise his God on an altar builded fair
 Will heap it with the Works of the Lord In the morning air
 Spices shall burn on it and by their pale smoke curled
 Like shoots of all the Green Things the God of this bright World
 Shall see the Boys desire to pay his debt of praise
 The Boy turns round about seeking with careful gaze
 An altar meet and worthy but each table and chair
 Has some defect each piece is needing some repair
 To perfect it the chairs have broken legs and backs
 The tables are uneven and every highboy lacks
 A handle or a drawer the desks are bruised and worn
 And even a wide sofa has its cane seat torn
 Only in the gloom far in the corner there
 The lacquer musicstand is elegant and rare
 Clear and slim of line with its four wings outspread
 The sound of old quartets a tenuous faint thread
 Hanging and floating over it it stands supreme
 Black and gold and crimson in one twisted scheme

 A candle on the bookcase feels a draught and wavers
 Stippling the whitewashed walls with dancing shades and quavers
 A bedpost grown colossal jigs about the ceiling
 And shadows strangely altered stain the walls revealing
 Eagles and rabbits and weird faces pulled awry
 And hands which fetch and carry things incessantly
 Under the Eastern window where the morning sun
 Must touch it stands the musicstand and on each one
 Of its broad platforms is a pyramid of stones
 And metals and dried flowers and pine and hemlock cones
 An orioles nest with the four eggs neatly blown
 The rattle of a rattlesnake and three large brown
 Butternuts uncracked six butterflies impaled
 With a green luna moth a snakeskin freshly scaled
 Some sunflower seeds wampum and a bloodytooth shell
 A blue jay feather all together piled pellmell
 The stand will hold no more The Boy with humming head
 Looks once again blows out the light and creeps to bed

 The Boy keeps solemn vigil while outside the wind
 Blows gustily and clear and slaps against the blind
 He hardly tries to sleep so sharp his ecstasy
 It burns his soul to emptiness and sets it free
 For adoration only for worship Dedicate
 His unsheathed soul is naked in its novitiate
 The hours strike below from the clock on the stair
 The Boy is a white flame suspiring in prayer
 Morning will bring the sun the Golden Eye of Him
 Whose splendour must be veiled by starry cherubim
 Whose Feet shimmer like crystal in the streets of Heaven
 Like an open rose the sun will stand up even
 Fronting the windowsill and when the casement glows
 Rosered with the newblown morning then the fire which flows
 From the sun will fall upon the altar and ignite
 The spices and his sacrifice will burn in perfumed light
 Over the musicstand the ghosts of sounds will swim
 Viols damore and hautbois accorded to a hymn
 The Boy will see the faintest breath of angels wings
 Fanning the smoke and voices will flower through the strings
 He dares no farther vision and with scalding eyes
 Waits upon the daylight and his great emprise

 The cold grey light of dawn was whitening the wall
 When the Boy finedrawn by sleeplessness started his ritual
 He washed all shivering and pointed like a flame
 He threw the shutters open and in the windowframe
 The morning glimmered like a tarnished Venice glass
 He took his Chinese pastilles and put them in a mass
 Upon the mantelpiece till he could seek a plate
 Worthy to hold them burning Alas He had been late
 In thinking of this need and now he could not find
 Platter or saucer rare enough to ease his mind
 The house was not astir and he dared not go down
 Into the barnchamber lest some door should be blown
 And slam before the draught he made as he went out
 The light was growing yellower and still he looked about
 A flash of almost crimson from the gilded pear
 Upon the musicstand startled him waiting there
 The sun would rise and he would meet it unprepared
 Labelled a fool in having missed what he had dared
 He ran across the room took his pastilles and laid
 Them on the flattopped pear most carefully displayed
 To light with ease then stood a little to one side
 Focussed a burningglass and painstakingly tried
 To hold it angled so the bunched and prismed rays
 Should leap upon each other and spring into a blaze
 Sharp as a wheeling edge of disked carnation flame
 Gemhard and cutting upward slowly the round sun came
 The arrowed fire caught the burningglass and glanced
 Split to a multitude of pointed spears and lanced
 A deeper hotter flame it took the incense pile
 Which welcomed it and broke into a little smile
 Of yellow flamelets creeping crackling thrusting up
 A golden redslashed lily in a lacquer cup

 O ye Fire and Heat Bless ye the Lord Praise Him and Magnify Him
 for ever
 O ye Winter and Summer Bless ye the Lord Praise Him and Magnify Him
 for ever
 O ye Nights and Days Bless ye the Lord Praise Him and Magnify Him
 for ever
 O ye Lightnings and Clouds Bless ye the Lord Praise Him and Magnify Him
 for ever

 A moment so it hung widecurved brightpetalled seeming
 A chalice foamed with sunrise The Boy woke from his dreaming
 A spike of flame had caught the card of butterflies
 The orioles nest took fire soon all four galleries
 Where he had spread his treasures were become one tongue
 Of gleaming brutal fire The Boy instantly swung
 His pitcher off the washstand and turned it upside down
 The flames drooped back and sizzled and all his senses grown
 Acute by fear the Boy grabbed the quilt from his bed
 And flung it over all and then with aching head
 He watched the early sunshine glint on the remains
 Of his holy offering The lacquer stand had stains
 Ugly and charred all over and where the golden pear
 Had been a deep black hole gaped miserably His dear
 Treasures were puffs of ashes only the stones were there
 Winking in the brightness
 The clock upon the stair
 Struck five and in the kitchen someone shook a grate
 The Boy began to dress for it was getting late




Spring Day


Bath

The day is freshwashed and fair and there is a smell of tulips and
narcissus in the air

The sunshine pours in at the bathroom window and bores through the
water in the bathtub in lathes and planes of greenishwhite It
cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel and cracks it to bright
light

Little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance
dance and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling a stir
of my finger sets them whirring reeling I move a foot and the planes
of light in the water jar I lie back and laugh and let the
greenwhite water the sunflawed beryl water flow over me The day is
almost too bright to bear the green water covers me from the too bright
day I will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots

The sky is blue and high A crow flaps by the window and there is a
whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air


Breakfast Table

In the freshwashed sunlight the breakfast table is decked and white
It offers itself in flat surrender tendering tastes and smells and
colours and metals and grains and the white cloth falls over its
side draped and wide Wheels of white glitter in the silver
coffeepot hot and spinning like catherinewheels they whirl and
twirland my eyes begin to smart the little white dazzling wheels
prick them like darts Placid and peaceful the rolls of bread spread
themselves in the sun to bask A stack of butterpats pyramidal shout
orange through the white scream flutter call Yellow Yellow
Yellow Coffee steam rises in a stream clouds the silver teaservice
with mist and twists up into the sunlight revolved involuted
suspiring higher and higher fluting in a thin spiral up the high blue
sky A crow flies by and croaks at the coffee steam The day is new and
fair with good smells in the air


Walk

Over the street the white clouds meet and sheer away without touching

On the sidewalks boys are playing marbles Glass marbles with amber
and blue hearts roll together and part with a sweet clashing noise
The boys strike them with black and red striped agates The glass
marbles spit crimson when they are hit and slip into the gutters under
rushing brown water I smell tulips and narcissus in the air but there
are no flowers anywhere only white dust whipping up the street and a
girl with a gay Spring hat and blowing skirts The dust and the wind
flirt at her ankles and her neat highheeled patent leather shoes
Tap tap the little heels pat the pavement and the wind rustles among
the flowers on her hat

A watercart crawls slowly on the other side of the way It is green
and gay with new paint and rumbles contentedly sprinkling clear water
over the white dust Clear zigzagging water which smells of tulips and
narcissus

The thickening branches make a pink grisaille against the blue sky

Whoop The clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time
Whoop And a mans hat careers down the street in front of the white
dust leaps into the branches of a tree veers away and trundles ahead
of the wind jarring the sunlight into spokes of rosecolour and green

A motorcar cuts a swathe through the bright air sharpbeaked
irresistible shouting to the wind to make way A glare of dust and
sunshine tosses together behind it and settles down The sky is quiet
and high and the morning is fair with freshwashed air


Midday and Afternoon

Swirl of crowded streets Shock and recoil of traffic The stockstill
brick facade of an old church against which the waves of people lurch
and withdraw Flare of sunshine down sidestreets Eddies of light in
the windows of chemists shops with their blue gold purple jars
darting colours far into the crowd Loud bangs and tremors murmurings
out of high windows whirring of machine belts blurring of horses and
motors A quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car and the
jar of a churchbell knocking against the metal blue of the sky I am a
piece of the town a bit of blown dust thrust along with the crowd
Proud to feel the pavement under me reeling with feet Feet tripping
skipping lagging dragging plodding doggedly or springing up and
advancing on firm elastic insteps A boy is selling papers I smell them
clean and new from the press They are fresh like the air and pungent
as tulips and narcissus

The blue sky pales to lemon and great tongues of gold blind the
shopwindows putting out their contents in a flood of flame


Night and Sleep

The day takes her ease in slippered yellow Electric signs gleam out
along the shop fronts following each other They grow and grow and
blow into patterns of fireflowers as the sky fades Trades scream in
spots of light at the unruffled night Twinkle jab snap that means a
new play and over the way plop drop quiver is the sidelong sliver
of a watchmakers sign with its length on another street A gigantic mug
of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building but the sky
is high and has her own stars why should she heed ours

I leave the city with speed Wheels whirl to take me back to my trees
and my quietness The breeze which blows with me is freshwashed and
clean it has come but recently from the high sky There are no flowers
in bloom yet but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus

My room is tranquil and friendly Out of the window I can see the
distant city a band of twinkling gems little flowerheads with no
stems I cannot see the beerglass nor the letters of the restaurants
and shops I passed now the signs blur and all together make the city
glowing on a night of fine weather like a garden stirring and blowing
for the Spring

The night is freshwashed and fair and there is a whiff of flowers in
the air

Wrap me close sheets of lavender Pour your blue and purple dreams
into my ears The breeze whispers at the shutters and mutters queer
tales of old days and cobbled streets and youths leaping their horses
down marble stairways Pale blue lavender you are the colour of the
sky when it is freshwashed and fair I smell the stars they
are like tulips and narcissus I smell them in the air




The DinnerParty



 Fish

 So they said
 With their wineglasses delicately poised
 Mocking at the thing they cannot understand
 So they said again
 Amused and insolent
 The silver on the table glittered
 And the red wine in the glasses
 Seemed the blood I had wasted
 In a foolish cause


 Game

 The gentleman with the greyandblack whiskers
 Sneered languidly over his quail
 Then my heart flew up and laboured
 And I burst from my own holding
 And hurled myself forward
 With straight blows I beat upon him
 Furiously with redhot anger I thrust against him
 But my weapon slithered over his polished surface
 And I recoiled upon myself
 Panting


 DrawingRoom

 In a dress all softness and halftones
 Indolent and halfreclined
 She lay upon a couch
 With the firelight reflected in her jewels
 But her eyes had no reflection
 They swam in a grey smoke
 The smoke of smouldering ashes
 The smoke of her cindered heart


 Coffee

 They sat in a circle with their coffeecups
 One dropped in a lump of sugar
 One stirred with a spoon
 I saw them as a circle of ghosts
 Sipping blackness out of beautiful china
 And mildly protesting against my coarseness
 In being alive


 Talk

 They took dead mens souls
 And pinned them on their breasts for ornament
 Their cufflinks and tiaras
 Were gems dug from a grave
 They were ghouls battening on exhumed thoughts
 And I took a green liqueur from a servant
 So that he might come near me
 And give me the comfort of a living thing


 Eleven OClock

 The front door was hard and heavy
 It shut behind me on the house of ghosts
 I flattened my feet on the pavement
 To feel it solid under me
 I ran my hand along the railings
 And shook them
 And pressed their pointed bars
 Into my palms
 The hurt of it reassured me
 And I did it again and again
 Until they were bruised
 When I woke in the night
 I laughed to find them aching
 For only living flesh can suffer




Stravinskys Three Pieces Grotesques for String Quartet



 First Movement

 Thinvoiced nasal pipes
 Drawing sound out and out
 Until it is a screeching thread
 Sharp and cutting sharp and cutting
 It hurts
 Wheeee
 Bump Bump Tongtibump
 There are drums here
 Banging
 And wooden shoes beating the round grey stones
 Of the marketplace
 Wheeee
 Sabots slapping the worn old stones
 And a shaking and cracking of dancing bones
 Clumsy and hard they are
 And uneven
 Losing half a beat
 Because the stones are slippery
 Bumpetytong Wheeee Tong
 The thin Spring leaves
 Shake to the banging of shoes
 Shoes beat slap
 Shuffle rap
 And the nasal pipes squeal with their pigs voices
 Little pigs voices
 Weaving among the dancers
 A fine white thread
 Linking up the dancers
 Bang Bump Tong
 Petticoats
 Stockings
 Sabots
 Delirium flapping its thighbones
 Red blue yellow
 Drunkenness steaming in colours
 Red yellow blue
 Colours and flesh weaving together
 In and out with the dance
 Coarse stuffs and hot flesh weaving together
 Pigs cries white and tenuous
 White and painful
 White and
 Bump
 Tong


 Second Movement

 Pale violin music whiffs across the moon
 A pale smoke of violin music blows over the moon
 Cherry petals fall and flutter
 And the white Pierrot
 Wreathed in the smoke of the violins
 Splashed with cherry petals falling falling
 Claws a grave for himself in the fresh earth
 With his fingernails


 Third Movement

 An organ growls in the heavy roofgroins of a church
 It wheezes and coughs
 The nave is blue with incense
 Writhing twisting
 Snaking over the heads of the chanting priests
 Requiem aeternam dona ei Domine
 The priests whine their bastard Latin
 And the censers swing and click
 The priests walk endlessly
 Round and round
 Droning their Latin
 Off the key
 The organ crashes out in a flaring chord
 And the priests hitch their chant up half a tone
 Dies illa dies irae
 Calamitatis et miseriae
 Dies magna et amara valde
 A wind rattles the leaded windows
 The little pearshaped candle flames leap and flutter
 Dies illa dies irae
 The swaying smoke drifts over the altar
 Calamitatis et miseriae
 The shuffling priests sprinkle holy water
 Dies magna et amara valde
 And there is a stark stillness in the midst of them
 Stretched upon a bier
 His ears are stone to the organ
 His eyes are flint to the candles
 His body is ice to the water
 Chant priests
 Whine shuffle genuflect
 He will always be as rigid as he is now
 Until he crumbles away in a dust heap
 Lacrymosa dies illa
 Qua resurget ex favilla
 Judicandus homo reus
 Above the grey pillars the roof is in darkness




Towns in Colour



 I

 Red Slippers

Red slippers in a shopwindow and outside in the street flaws of grey
windy sleet


Behind the polished glass the slippers hang in long threads of red
festooning from the ceiling like stalactites of blood flooding the eyes
of passersby with dripping colour jamming their crimson reflections
against the windows of cabs and tramcars screaming their claret and
salmon into the teeth of the sleet plopping their little round maroon
lights upon the tops of umbrellas

The row of white sparkling shop fronts is gashed and bleeding it
bleeds red slippers They spout under the electric light fluid and
fluctuating a hot rainand freeze again to red slippers myriadly
multiplied in the mirror side of the window


They balance upon arched insteps like springing bridges of crimson
lacquer they swing up over curved heels like whirling tanagers sucked
in a windpocket they flatten out heelless like July ponds flared
and burnished by red rockets

Snap snap they are crackersparks of scarlet in the white monotonous
block of shops

They plunge the clangour of billions of vermilion trumpets into the
crowd outside and echo in faint rose over the pavement


People hurry by for these are only shoes and in a window farther
down is a big lotus bud of cardboard whose petals open every few
minutes and reveal a wax doll with staring bead eyes and flaxen hair
lolling awkwardly in its flower chair

One has often seen shoes but whoever saw a cardboard lotus bud before


The flaws of grey windy sleet beat on the shopwindow where there are
only red slippers

 Thompsons Lunch RoomGrand Central Station

 Study in Whites


 Waxwhite
 Floor ceiling walls
 Ivory shadows
 Over the pavement
 Polished to cream surfaces
 By constant sweeping
 The big room is coloured like the petals
 Of a great magnolia
 And has a patina
 Of flower bloom
 Which makes it shine dimly
 Under the electric lamps
 Chairs are ranged in rows
 Like sepia seeds
 Waiting fulfilment
 The chalkwhite spot of a cooks cap
 Moves unglossily against the vaguely bright wall
 Dull chalkwhite striking the retina like a blow
 Through the wavering uncertainty of steam
 Vitreouswhite of glasses with green reflections
 Icegreen carboys shiftinggreener bluerwith the jar of moving water
 Jagged greenwhite bowls of pressed glass
 Rearing snowpeaks of chipped sugar
 Above the lighthouseshaped castors
 Of grey pepper and greywhite salt
 Greywhite placards Oyster Stew Cornbeef Hash Frankfurters
 Marble slabs veined with words in meandering lines
 Dropping on the white counter like horn notes
 Through a web of violins
 The flat yellow lights of oranges
 The cubered splashes of apples
 In high plated epergnes
 The electric clock jerks every halfminute
 ComingPast
 Three beefsteaks and a chickenpie
 Bawled through a slide while the clock jerks heavily
 A man carries a china mug of coffee to a distant chair
 Two rice puddings and a salmon salad
 Are pushed over the counter
 The unfulfilled chairs open to receive them
 A spoon falls upon the floor with the impact of metal striking stone
 And the sound throws across the room
 Sharp invisible zigzags
 Of silver



 III

 An Opera House


 Within the gold square of the proscenium arch
 A curtain of orange velvet hangs in stiff folds
 Its tassels jarring slightly when someone crosses the stage behind
 Gold carving edges the balconies
 Rims the boxes
 Runs up and down fluted pillars
 Little knifestabs of gold
 Shine out whenever a box door is opened
 Gold clusters
 Flash in soft explosions
 On the blue darkness
 Suck back to a point
 And disappear
 Hoops of gold
 Circle necks wrists fingers
 Pierce ears
 Poise on heads
 And fly up above them in coloured sparkles
 Gold
 Gold
 The opera house is a treasurebox of gold
 Gold in a broad smear across the orchestra pit
 Gold of horns trumpets tubas
 Goldspungold twitteringgold snappinggold
 Of harps
 The conductor raises his baton
 The brass blares out
 Crass crude
 Parvenu fat powerful
 Golden
 Rich as the fat clapping hands in the boxes
 Cymbals gigantic coinshaped
 Crash
 The orange curtain parts
 And the primadonna steps forward
 One note
 A drop transparent iridescent
 A gold bubble
 It floats floats
 And bursts against the lips of a bank president
 In the grand tier



 IV

 Afternoon Rain in State Street


 Crosshatchings of rain against grey walls
 Slant lines of black rain
 In front of the up and down wet stone sides of buildings
 Below
 Greasy shiny black horizontal
 The street
 And over it umbrellas
 Black polished dots
 Struck to white
 An instant
 Stream in two flat lines
 Slipping past each other with the smoothness of oil
 Like a foursided wedge
 The Custom House Tower
 Pokes at the low flat sky
 Pushing it farther and farther up
 Lifting it away from the housetops
 Lifting it in one piece as though it were a sheet of tin
 With the lever of its apex
 The crosshatchings of rain cut the Tower obliquely
 Scratching lines of black wire across it
 Mutilating its perpendicular grey surface
 With the sharp precision of tools
 The city is rigid with straight lines and angles
 A chequered table of blacks and greys
 Oblong blocks of flatness
 Crawl by with lowgeared engines
 And pass to short upright squares
 Shrinking with distance
 A steamer in the basin blows its whistle
 And the sound shoots across the rain hatchings
 A narrow level bar of steel
 Hard cubes of lemon
 Superimpose themselves upon the fronts of buildings
 As the windows light up
 But the lemon cubes are edged with angles
 Upon which they cannot impinge
 Up straight down straightsquare
 Crumpled greywhite papers
 Blow along the sidewalks
 Contorted horrible
 Without curves
 A horse steps in a puddle
 And white glaring water spurts up
 In stiff outflaring lines
 Like the rattling stems of reeds
 The city is heraldic with angles
 A sombre escutcheon of argent and sable
 And countercoloured bends of rain
 Hung over a foursquare civilization
 When a street lamp comes out
 I gaze at it for fully thirty seconds
 To rest my brain with the suffusing round brilliance of its globe



 V

 An Aquarium


 Streaks of green and yellow iridescence
 Silver shiftings
 Rings veering out of rings
 Silvergold
 Greygreen opaqueness sliding down
 With sharp white bubbles
 Shooting and dancing
 Flinging quickly outward
 Nosing the bubbles
 Swallowing them
 Fish
 Blue shadows against silversaffron water
 The light rippling over them
 In steelbright tremors
 Outspread translucent fins
 Flute fold and relapse
 The threaded light prints through them on the pebbles
 In scarcely tarnished twinklings
 Curving of spotted spines
 Slow upshifts
 Lazy convolutions
 Then a sudden swift straightening
 And darting below
 Oblique grey shadows
 Athwart a pale casement
 Roped and curled
 Green maneating eels
 Slumber in undulate rhythms
 With crests laid horizontal on their backs
 Barred fish
 Striped fish
 Uneven disks of fish
 Slip slide whirl turn
 And never touch
 Metallic blue fish
 With fins wide and yellow and swaying
 Like Oriental fans
 Hold the sun in their bellies
 And glow with light
 Blue brilliance cut by black bars
 An oblong pane of strawcoloured shimmer
 Across it in a tangent
 A smear of rose black silver
 Short twists and upstartings
 Roseblack in a setting of bubbles
 Sunshine playing between red and black flowers
 On a blue and gold lawn
 Shadows and polished surfaces
 Facets of mauve and purple
 A constant modulation of values
 Shaftshaped
 With green bead eyes
 Thicknosed
 Heliotropecoloured
 Swift spots of chrysolite and coral
 In the midst of green pearl amethyst irradiations

 Outside
 A willowtree flickers
 With little white jerks
 And long blue waves
 Rise steadily beyond the outer islands

array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS
