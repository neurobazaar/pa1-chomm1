RIO GRANDES LAST RACE AND OTHER VERSES





Rio Grandes Last Race



 Now this was what Macpherson told
 While waiting in the stand
 A reckless rider overbold
 The only man with hands to hold
 The rushing Rio Grande

 He said This day I bid goodbye
 To bit and bridle rein
 To ditches deep and fences high
 For I have dreamed a dream and I
 Shall never ride again

 I dreamt last night I rode this race
 That I today must ride
 And cantring down to take my place
 I saw full many an old friends face
 Come stealing to my side

 Dead men on horses long since dead
 They clustered on the track
 The champions of the days long fled
 They moved around with noiseless tread 
 Bay chestnut brown and black

 And one man on a big grey steed
 Rode up and waved his hand
 Said he We help a friend in need
 And we have come to give a lead
 To you and Rio Grande

 For you must give the field the slip
 So never draw the rein
 But keep him moving with the whip
 And if he falter  set your lip
 And rouse him up again

 But when you reach the big stone wall
 Put down your bridle hand
 And let him sail  he cannot fall 
 But dont you interfere at all
 You trust old Rio Grande

 We started and in front we showed
 The big horse running free
 Right fearlessly and game he strode
 And by my side those dead men rode
 Whom no one else could see

 As silently as flies a bird
 They rode on either hand
 At every fence I plainly heard
 The phantom leader give the word
 Make room for Rio Grande

 I spurred him on to get the lead
 I chanced full many a fall
 But swifter still each phantom steed
 Kept with me and at racing speed
 We reached the big stone wall

 And there the phantoms on each side
 Drew in and blocked his leap
 Make room make room I loudly cried
 But right in front they seemed to ride 
 I cursed them in my sleep

 He never flinched he faced it game
 He struck it with his chest
 And every stone burst out in flame
 And Rio Grande and I became
 As phantoms with the rest

 And then I woke and for a space
 All nerveless did I seem
 For I have ridden many a race
 But never one at such a pace
 As in that fearful dream

 And I am sure as man can be
 That out upon the track
 Those phantoms that men cannot see
 Are waiting now to ride with me
 And I shall not come back

 For I must ride the dead mens race
 And follow their command
 Twere worse than death the foul disgrace
 If I should fear to take my place
 Today on Rio Grande

 He mounted and a jest he threw
 With never sign of gloom
 But all who heard the story knew
 That Jack Macpherson brave and true
 Was going to his doom

 They started and the big black steed
 Came flashing past the stand
 All singlehanded in the lead
 He strode along at racing speed
 The mighty Rio Grande

 But on his ribs the whalebone stung
 A madness it did seem
 And soon it rose on every tongue
 That Jack Macpherson rode among
 The creatures of his dream

 He looked to left and looked to right
 As though men rode beside
 And Rio Grande with foamflecks white
 Raced at his jumps in headlong flight
 And cleared them in his stride

 But when they reached the big stone wall
 Down went the bridlehand
 And loud we heard Macpherson call
 Make room or half the field will fall
 Make room for Rio Grande

     

 Hes down hes down And horse and man
 Lay quiet side by side
 No need the pallid face to scan
 We knew with Rio Grande he ran
 The race the dead men ride




By the Grey Gulfwater



 Far to the Northward there lies a land
 A wonderful land that the winds blow over
 And none may fathom nor understand
 The charm it holds for the restless rover
 A great grey chaos  a land half made
 Where endless space is and no life stirreth
 And the soul of a man will recoil afraid
 From the sphinxlike visage that Nature weareth
 But old Dame Nature though scornful craves
 Her dole of death and her share of slaughter
 Many indeed are the nameless graves
 Where her victims sleep by the Grey Gulfwater

 Slowly and slowly those grey streams glide
 Drifting along with a languid motion
 Lapping the reedbeds on either side
 Wending their way to the Northern Ocean
 Grey are the plains where the emus pass
 Silent and slow with their staid demeanour
 Over the dead mens graves the grass
 Maybe is waving a trifle greener
 Down in the world where men toil and spin
 Dame Nature smiles as mans hand has taught her
 Only the dead men her smiles can win
 In the great lone land by the Grey Gulfwater

 For the strength of man is an insects strength
 In the face of that mighty plain and river
 And the life of a man is a moments length
 To the life of the stream that will run for ever
 And so it cometh they take no part
 In smallworld worries each hardy rover
 Rideth abroad and is light of heart
 With the plains around and the blue sky over
 And up in the heavens the brown lark sings
 The songs that the strange wild land has taught her
 Full of thanksgiving her sweet song rings 
 And I wish I were back by the Grey Gulfwater




With the Cattle



 The drought is down on field and flock
 The riverbed is dry
 And we must shift the starving stock
 Before the cattle die
 We muster up with weary hearts
 At breaking of the day
 And turn our heads to foreign parts
 To take the stock away
 And its hunt em up and dog em
 And its get the whip and flog em
 For its weary work is droving when theyre dying every day
 By stockroutes bare and eaten
 On dusty roads and beaten
 With half a chance to save their lives we take the stock away

 We cannot use the whip for shame
 On beasts that crawl along
 We have to drop the weak and lame
 And try to save the strong
 The wrath of God is on the track
 The drought fiend holds his sway
 With blows and cries and stockwhip crack
 We take the stock away
 As they fall we leave them lying
 With the crows to watch them dying
 Grim sextons of the Overland that fasten on their prey
 By the fiery duststorm drifting
 And the mocking mirage shifting
 In heat and drought and hopeless pain we take the stock away

 In dull despair the days go by
 With never hope of change
 But every stage we draw more nigh
 Towards the mountain range
 And some may live to climb the pass
 And reach the great plateau
 And revel in the mountain grass
 By streamlets fed with snow
 As the mountain wind is blowing
 It starts the cattle lowing
 And calling to each other down the dusty long array
 And there speaks a grizzled drover
 Well thank God the worst is over
 The creatures smell the mountain grass thats twenty miles away

 They press towards the mountain grass
 They look with eager eyes
 Along the rugged stony pass
 That slopes towards the skies
 Their feet may bleed from rocks and stones
 But though the blooddrop starts
 They struggle on with stifled groans
 For hope is in their hearts
 And the cattle that are leading
 Though their feet are worn and bleeding
 Are breaking to a kind of run  pull up and let them go
 For the mountain wind is blowing
 And the mountain grass is growing
 They settle down by running streams icecold with melted snow

     

 The days are done of heat and drought
 Upon the stricken plain
 The wind has shifted right about
 And brought the welcome rain
 The river runs with sullen roar
 All flecked with yellow foam
 And we must take the road once more
 To bring the cattle home
 And its Lads well raise a chorus
 Theres a pleasant trip before us
 And the horses bound beneath us as we start them down the track
 And the drovers canter singing
 Through the sweet green grasses springing
 Towards the faroff mountainland to bring the cattle back

 Are these the beasts we brought away
 That move so lively now
 They scatter off like flying spray
 Across the mountains brow
 And dashing down the rugged range
 We hear the stockwhip crack
 Good faith it is a welcome change
 To bring such cattle back
 And its Steady down the lead there
 And its Let em stop and feed there
 For theyre wild as mountain eagles and their sides are all afoam
 But theyre settling down already
 And theyll travel nice and steady
 With cheery call and jest and song we fetch the cattle home

 We have to watch them close at night
 For fear theyll make a rush
 And break away in headlong flight
 Across the open bush
 And by the campfires cheery blaze
 With mellow voice and strong
 We hear the lonely watchman raise
 The Overlanders song
 Oh its when were done with roving
 With the camping and the droving
 Its homeward down the Bland well go and never more well roam
 While the stars shine out above us
 Like the eyes of those who love us 
 The eyes of those who watch and wait to greet the cattle home

 The plains are all awave with grass
 The skies are deepest blue
 And leisurely the cattle pass
 And feed the long day through
 But when we sight the station gate
 We make the stockwhips crack
 A welcome sound to those who wait
 To greet the cattle back
 And through the twilight falling
 We hear their voices calling
 As the cattle splash across the ford and churn it into foam
 And the children run to meet us
 And our wives and sweethearts greet us
 Their heroes from the Overland who brought the cattle home




 The First Surveyor



 The opening of the railway line  the Governor and all
 With flags and banners down the street a banquet and a ball
 Hark to em at the station now Theyre raising cheer on cheer
 The man who brought the railway through  our friend the engineer

 They cheer HIS pluck and enterprise and engineering skill
 Twas my old husband found the pass behind that big Red Hill
 Before the engineer was grown we settled with our stock
 Behind that great big mountain chain a line of range and rock 
 A line that kept us starving there in weary weeks of drought
 With neer a track across the range to let the cattle out

 Twas then with horses starved and weak and scarcely fit to crawl
 My husband went to find a way across that rocky wall
 He vanished in the wilderness God knows where he was gone
 He hunted till his food gave out but still he battled on
 His horses strayed  twas well they did  they made towards the grass
 And down behind that big red hill they found an easy pass

 He followed up and blazed the trees to show the safest track
 Then drew his belt another hole and turned and started back
 His horses died  just one pulled through with nothing much to spare
 God bless the beast that brought him home the old white Arab mare
 We drove the cattle through the hills along the newfound way
 And this was our first campingground  just where I live today

 Then others came across the range and built the township here
 And then there came the railway line and this young engineer
 He drove about with tents and traps a cook to cook his meals
 A bath to wash himself at night a chainman at his heels
 And that was all the pluck and skill for which hes cheered and praised
 For after all he took the track the same my husband blazed

 My poor old husband dead and gone with never feast nor cheer
 Hes buried by the railway line  I wonder can he hear
 When down the very track he marked and close to where hes laid
 The cattle trains go roaring down the oneinthirty grade
 I wonder does he hear them pass and can he see the sight
 When through the dark the fast express goes flaming by at night

 I think twould comfort him to know theres someone left to care
 Ill take some things this very night and hold a banquet there
 The hard old fare weve often shared together him and me
 Some damper and a bite of beef a pannikin of tea
 Well do without the bands and flags the speeches and the fuss
 We know who OUGHT to get the cheers and thats enough for us

 Whats that They wish that Id come down  the oldest settler here
 Present me to the Governor and that young engineer
 Well just you tell his Excellence and put the thing polite
 Im sorry but I cant come down  Im dining out tonight




Mulga Bills Bicycle



 Twas Mulga Bill from Eaglehawk that caught the cycling craze
 He turned away the good old horse that served him many days
 He dressed himself in cycling clothes resplendent to be seen
 He hurried off to town and bought a shining new machine
 And as he wheeled it through the door with air of lordly pride
 The grinning shop assistant said Excuse me can you ride

 See here young man said Mulga Bill from Walgett to the sea
 From Conroys Gap to Castlereagh theres none can ride like me
 Im good all round at everything as everybody knows
 Although Im not the one to talk  I HATE a man that blows
 But riding is my special gift my chiefest sole delight
 Just ask a wild duck can it swim a wild cat can it fight
 Theres nothing clothed in hair or hide or built of flesh or steel
 Theres nothing walks or jumps or runs on axle hoof or wheel
 But what Ill sit while hide will hold and girths and straps are tight
 Ill ride this here twowheeled concern right straight away at sight

 Twas Mulga Bill from Eaglehawk that sought his own abode
 That perched above the Dead Mans Creek beside the mountain road
 He turned the cycle down the hill and mounted for the fray
 But ere hed gone a dozen yards it bolted clean away
 It left the track and through the trees just like a silver streak
 It whistled down the awful slope towards the Dead Mans Creek

 It shaved a stump by half an inch it dodged a big whitebox
 The very wallaroos in fright went scrambling up the rocks
 The wombats hiding in their caves dug deeper underground
 As Mulga Bill as white as chalk sat tight to every bound
 It struck a stone and gave a spring that cleared a fallen tree
 It raced beside a precipice as close as close could be
 And then as Mulga Bill let out one last despairing shriek
 It made a leap of twenty feet into the Dead Mans Creek

 Twas Mulga Bill from Eaglehawk that slowly swam ashore
 He said Ive had some narrer shaves and lively rides before
 Ive rode a wild bull round a yard to win a five pound bet
 But this was the most awful ride that Ive encountered yet
 Ill give that twowheeled outlaw best its shaken all my nerve
 To feel it whistle through the air and plunge and buck and swerve
 Its safe at rest in Dead Mans Creek well leave it lying still
 A horses back is good enough henceforth for Mulga Bill




The Pearl Diver



 Kanzo Makame the diver sturdy and small Japanee
 Seeker of pearls and of pearlshell down in the depths of the sea
 Trudged oer the bed of the ocean searching industriously

 Over the pearlgrounds the lugger drifted  a little white speck
 Joe Nagasaki the tender holding the lifeline on deck
 Talked through the rope to the diver knew when to drift or to check

 Kanzo was king of his lugger master and diver in one
 Diving wherever it pleased him taking instructions from none
 Hither and thither he wandered steering by stars and by sun

 Fearless he was beyond credence looking at death eye to eye
 This was his formula always All man go dead byandbye 
 Sposing time come no can help it  spose time no come then no die

 Dived in the depths of the Darnleys down twenty fathom and five
 Down where by law and by reason men are forbidden to dive
 Down in a pressure so awful that only the strongest survive

 Sweated four men at the air pumps fast as the handles could go
 Forcing the air down that reached him heated and tainted and slow 
 Kanzo Makame the diver stayed seven minutes below

 Came up on deck like a dead man paralysed body and brain
 Suffered while blood was returning infinite tortures of pain
 Sailed once again to the Darnleys  laughed and descended again

     

 Scarce grew the shell in the shallows rarely a patch could they touch
 Always the take was so little always the labour so much
 Always they thought of the Islands held by the lumbering Dutch

 Islands where shell was in plenty lying in passage and bay
 Islands where divers could gather hundreds of shell in a day
 But the lumbering Dutch with their gunboats hunted the divers away

 Joe Nagasaki the tender finding the profits grow small
 Said Let us go to the Islands try for a number one haul
 If we get caught go to prison  let them take lugger and all

 Kanzo Makame the diver  knowing full well what it meant 
 Fatalist gambler and stoic smiled a broad smile of content
 Flattened in mainsail and foresail and off to the Islands they went

 Close to the headlands they drifted picking up shell by the ton
 Piled up on deck were the oysters opening wide in the sun
 When from the lee of the headland boomed the report of a gun

 Once that the diver was sighted pearlshell and lugger must go
 Joe Nagasaki decided  quick was the word and the blow 
 Cut both the pipe and the lifeline leaving the diver below

 Kanzo Makame the diver failing to quite understand
 Pulled the haul up on the lifeline found it was slack in his hand
 Then like a little brown stoic lay down and died on the sand

 Joe Nagasaki the tender smiling a sanctified smile
 Headed her straight for the gunboat  throwing out shells all the while 
 Then went aboard and reported No makee dive in three mile

 Dress no have got and no helmet  diver go shore on the spree
 Plenty wind come and break rudder  lugger get blown out to sea
 Take me to Japanee Consul he help a poor Japanee

     

 So the Dutch let him go and they watched him as off from the Islands he ran
 Doubting him much but what would you You have to be sure of your man
 Ere you wake up that nestfull of hornets  the little brown men of Japan

 Down in the ooze and the coral down where earths wonders are spread
 Helmeted ghastly and swollen Kanzo Makame lies dead
 Joe Nagasaki his tender is owner and diver instead

 Wearer of pearls in your necklace comfort yourself if you can
 These are the risks of the pearling  these are the ways of Japan
 Plenty more Japanee diver plenty more little brown man




The City of Dreadful Thirst



 The stranger came from Narromine and made his little joke 
 They say we folks in Narromine are narrowminded folk
 But all the smartest men down here are puzzled to define
 A kind of new phenomenon that came to Narromine

 Last summer up in Narromine twas gettin rather warm 
 Two hundred in the waterbag and lookin like a storm 
 We all were in the private bar the coolest place in town
 When out across the stretch of plain a cloud came rollin down

 We dont respect the clouds up there they fill us with disgust
 They mostly bring a Bogan shower  three raindrops and some dust
 But each man simultaneouslike to each man said I think
 That cloud suggests its up to us to have another drink

 Theres clouds of rain and clouds of dust  wed heard of them before
 And sometimes in the daily press we read of clouds of war
 But  if this aint the Gospel truth I hope that I may burst 
 That cloud that came to Narromine was just a cloud of thirst

 It wasnt like a common cloud twas more a sort of haze
 It settled down about the streets and stopped for days and days
 And not a drop of dew could fall and not a sunbeam shine
 To pierce that dismal sort of mist that hung on Narromine

 Oh Lord we had a dreadful time beneath that cloud of thirst
 We all chuckedup our daily work and went upon the burst
 The very blacks about the town that used to cadge for grub
 They made an organised attack and tried to loot the pub

 We couldnt leave the private bar no matter how we tried
 Shearers and squatters unionmen and blacklegs side by side
 Were drinkin there and dursnt move for each was sure he said
 Before hed get a halfamile the thirst would strike him dead

 We drank until the drink gave out we searched from room to room
 And round the pub like drunken ghosts went howling through the gloom
 The shearers found some kerosene and settled down again
 But all the squatter chaps and I we staggered to the train

 And once outside the cloud of thirst we felt as right as pie
 But while we stopped about the town we had to drink or die
 But now I hear its safe enough Im going back to work
 Because they say the cloud of thirst has shifted on to Bourke

 But when you see those clouds about  like this one over here 
 All white and frothy at the top just like a pint of beer
 Its time to go and have a drink for if that cloud should burst
 Youd find the drink would all be gone for thats a cloud of thirst

     

 We stood the man from Narromine a pint of halfandhalf
 He drank it off without a gasp in one tremendous quaff
 I joined some friends last night he said in what THEY called a spree
 But after Narromine twas just a holiday to me

 And now beyond the Western Range where sunset skies are red
 And clouds of dust and clouds of thirst go drifting overhead
 The railwaytrain is taking back along the Western Line
 That narrowminded person on his road to Narromine




Saltbush Bills Gamecock



 Twas Saltbush Bill with his travelling sheep was making his way to town
 He crossed them over the Hard Times Run and he came to the Take Em Down
 He counted through at the boundary gate and camped at the drafting yard
 For Stingy Smith of the Hard Times Run had hunted him rather hard
 He bore no malice to Stingy Smith  twas simply the hand of fate
 That caused his waggon to swerve aside and shatter old Stingys gate
 And being only the hand of fate it follows without a doubt
 It wasnt the fault of Saltbush Bill that Stingys sheep got out
 So Saltbush Bill with an easy heart prepared for what might befall
 Commenced his stages on Take Em Down the station of Rooster Hall

 Tis strange how often the men out back will take to some curious craft
 Some ruling passion to keep their thoughts away from the overdraft
 And Rooster Hall of the Take Em Down was widely known to fame
 As breeder of champion fighting cocks  his forte was the British Game
 The passing stranger within his gates that camped with old Rooster Hall
 Was forced to talk about fowls all night or else not talk at all
 Though droughts should come and though sheep should die
 his fowls were his sole delight
 He left his shed in the flood of work to watch two gamecocks fight
 He held in scorn the Australian Game that longlegged child of sin
 In a desperate fight with the steeltipped spurs the British Game must win
 The Australian bird was a mongrel bird with a touch of the jungle cock
 The want of breeding must find him out when facing the English stock
 For British breeding and British pluck must triumph it over all 
 And that was the root of the simple creed that governed old Rooster Hall

     

 Twas Saltbush Bill to the station rode ahead of his travelling sheep
 And sent a message to Rooster Hall that wakened him out of his sleep 
 A crafty message that fetched him out and hurried him as he came 
 A drover has an Australian Bird to match with your British Game
 Twas done and done in a half a trice a fivepound note aside
 Old Rooster Hall with his champion bird and the drovers bird untried
 Steel spurs of course said old Rooster Hall
 youll need em without a doubt
 You stick the spurs on your bird said Bill but mine fights best without
 Fights best without said old Rooster Hall he cant fight best unspurred
 You must be crazy But Saltbush Bill said Wait till you see my bird
 So Rooster Hall to his fowlyard went and quickly back he came
 Bearing a clipt and a shaven cock the pride of his English Game
 With an eye as fierce as an eaglehawk and a crow like a trumpet call
 He strutted about on the garden walk and cackled at Rooster Hall
 Then Rooster Hall sent off a boy with word to his cronies two
 McCrae the boss of the Black Police and Father Donahoo
 Full many a cockfight old McCrae had held in his empty Court
 With Father D as a pickerup  a regular allround Sport
 They got the message of Rooster Hall and down to his run they came
 Prepared to scoff at the drovers bird and to bet on the English Game
 They hied them off to the drovers camp while Saltbush rode before 
 Old Rooster Hall was a blithesome man when he thought of the treat in store
 They reached the camp where the drovers cook with countenance all serene
 Was boiling beef in an iron pot but never a fowl was seen

 Take off the beef from the fire said Bill
 and wait till you see the fight
 Theres something fresh for the billoffare 
 theres gamefowl stew tonight
 For Mister Hall has a fighting cock all feathered and clipped and spurred
 And hes fetched him here for a bit of sport to fight our Australian bird
 Ive made a match that our pet will win though hes hardly a fighting cock
 But hes game enough and its many a mile
 that hes tramped with the travelling stock
 The cook he banged on a saucepan lid and soon as the sound was heard
 Under the dray in the shadows hid a something moved and stirred
 A great tame Emu strutted out Said Saltbush Heres our bird
 But Rooster Hall and his cronies two drove home without a word

 The passing stranger within his gates that camps with old Rooster Hall
 Must talk about something else than fowls if he wishes to talk at all
 For the record lies in the local Court and filed in its deepest vault
 That Peter Hall of the Take Em Down was tried for a fierce assault
 On a stranger man who in all good faith and prompted by what he heard
 Had asked old Hall if a British Game could beat an Australian bird
 And old McCrae who was on the Bench as soon as the case was tried
 Remarked Discharged with a clean discharge  the assault was justified




Hay and Hell and Booligal



 You come and see me boys he said
 Youll find a welcome and a bed
 And whisky any time you call
 Although our township hasnt got
 The name of quite a lively spot 
 You see I live in Booligal

 And people have an awful down
 Upon the district and the town 
 Which worse than hell itself they call
 In fact the saying far and wide
 Along the Riverina side
 Is Hay and Hell and Booligal

 No doubt it suits em very well
 To say its worse than Hay or Hell
 But dont you heed their talk at all
 Of course theres heat  no one denies 
 And sand and dust and stacks of flies
 And rabbits too at Booligal

 But such a pleasant quiet place
 You never see a strangers face 
 They hardly ever care to call
 The drovers mostly pass it by
 They reckon that theyd rather die
 Than spend a night in Booligal

 The big mosquitoes frighten some 
 Youll lie awake to hear em hum 
 And snakes about the township crawl
 But shearers when they get their cheque
 They never come along and wreck
 The blessed town of Booligal

 But down in Hay the shearers come
 And fill themselves with fightingrum
 And chase blue devils up the wall
 And fight the snaggers every day
 Until there is the deuce to pay 
 Theres none of that in Booligal

 Of course there isnt much to see 
 The billiardtable used to be
 The great attraction for us all
 Until some careless drunken curs
 Got sleeping on it in their spurs
 And ruined it in Booligal

 Just now there is a howling drought
 That pretty near has starved us out 
 It never seems to rain at all
 But if there SHOULD come any rain
 You couldnt cross the blacksoil plain 
 Youd have to stop in Booligal

     

 WED HAVE TO STOP With bated breath
 We prayed that both in life and death
 Our fate in other lines might fall
 Oh send us to our just reward
 In Hay or Hell but gracious Lord
 Deliver us from Booligal




A Walgett Episode



 The sun strikes down with a blinding glare
 The skies are blue and the plains are wide
 The saltbush plains that are burnt and bare
 By Walgett out on the Barwon side 
 The Barwon river that wanders down
 In a leisurely manner by Walgett Town

 There came a stranger  a Cockatoo 
 The word means farmer as all men know
 Who dwell in the land where the kangaroo
 Barks loud at dawn and the whiteeyed crow
 Uplifts his song on the stockyard fence
 As he watches the lambkins passing hence

 The sunburnt stranger was gaunt and brown
 But it soon appeared that he meant to flout
 The iron law of the country town
 Which is  that the stranger has got to shout
 If he will not shout we must take him down
 Remarked the yokels of Walgett Town

 They baited a trap with a crafty bait
 With a crafty bait for they held discourse
 Concerning a new chum who of late
 Had bought such a thoroughly lazy horse
 They would wager that no one could ride him down
 The length of the city of Walgett Town

 The stranger was born on a horses hide
 So he took the wagers and made them good
 With his hardearned cash  but his hopes they died
 For the horse was a clotheshorse made of wood 
 Twas a wellknown horse that had taken down
 Full many a stranger in Walgett Town

 The stranger smiled with a sickly smile 
 Tis a sickly smile that the loser grins 
 And he said he had travelled for quite a while
 In trying to sell some marsupial skins
 And I thought that perhaps as youve took me down
 You would buy them from me in Walgett Town

 He said that his home was at Wingadee
 At Wingadee where he had for sale
 Some fifty skins and would guarantee
 They were fullsized skins with the ears and tail
 Complete and he sold them for money down
 To a venturesome buyer in Walgett Town

 Then he smiled a smile as he pouched the pelf
 Im glad that Im quit of them win or lose
 You can fetch them in when it suits yourself
 And youll find the skins  on the kangaroos
 Then he left  and the silence settled down
 Like a tangible thing upon Walgett Town




Father Rileys Horse



 Twas the horse thief Andy Regan that was hunted like a dog
 By the troopers of the Upper Murray side
 They had searched in every gully  they had looked in every log
 But never sight or track of him they spied
 Till the priest at Kileys Crossing heard a knocking very late
 And a whisper Father Riley  come across
 So his Revrence in pyjamas trotted softly to the gate
 And admitted Andy Regan  and a horse

 Now its listen Father Riley to the words Ive got to say
 For its close upon my death I am tonight
 With the troopers hard behind me Ive been hiding all the day
 In the gullies keeping close and out of sight
 But theyre watching all the ranges till theres not a bird could fly
 And Im fairly worn to pieces with the strife
 So Im taking no more trouble but Im going home to die
 Tis the only way I see to save my life

 Yes Im making home to mothers and Ill die o Tuesday next
 An be buried on the Thursday  and of course
 Im prepared to meet my penance but with one thing Im perplexed
 And its  Father its this jewel of a horse
 He was never bought nor paid for and theres not a man can swear
 To his owner or his breeder but I know
 That his sire was by Pedantic from the Old Pretender mare
 And his dam was close related to The Roe

 And theres nothing in the district that can race him for a step
 He could canter while theyre going at their top
 Hes the king of all the leppers that was ever seen to lep
 A fivefoot fence  hed clear it in a hop
 So Ill leave him with you Father till the dead shall rise again
 Tis yourself that knows a good un and of course
 You can say hes got by Moonlight out of Paddy Murphys plain
 If youre ever asked the breeding of the horse

 But its getting on to daylight and its time to say goodbye
 For the stars above the East are growing pale
 And Im making home to mother  and its hard for me to die
 But its harder still is keeping out of gaol
 You can ride the old horse over to my grave across the dip
 Where the wattle bloom is waving overhead
 Sure hell jump them fences easy  you must never raise the whip
 Or hell rush em  now goodbye and he had fled

 So they buried Andy Regan and they buried him to rights
 In the graveyard at the back of Kileys Hill
 There were fiveandtwenty mourners who had fiveandtwenty fights
 Till the very boldest fighters had their fill
 There were fifty horses racing from the graveyard to the pub
 And their riders flogged each other all the while
 And the lashins of the liquor And the lavins of the grub
 Oh poor Andy went to rest in proper style

 Then the races came to Kileys  with a steeplechase and all
 For the folk were mostly Irish round about
 And it takes an Irish rider to be fearless of a fall
 They were training morning in and morning out
 But they never started training till the sun was on the course
 For a superstitious story kept em back
 That the ghost of Andy Regan on a slashing chestnut horse
 Had been training by the starlight on the track

 And they read the nominations for the races with surprise
 And amusement at the Fathers little joke
 For a novice had been entered for the steeplechasing prize
 And they found that it was Father Rileys moke
 He was neat enough to gallop he was strong enough to stay
 But his owners views of training were immense
 For the Reverend Father Riley used to ride him every day
 And he never saw a hurdle nor a fence

 And the priest would join the laughter Oh said he I put him in
 For theres five and twenty sovereigns to be won
 And the poor would find it useful if the chestnut chanced to win
 And hell maybe win when all is said and done
 He had called him Faughaballagh which is French for clear the course
 And his colours were a vivid shade of green
 All the Dooleys and ODonnells were on Father Rileys horse
 While the Orangemen were backing Mandarin

 It was Hogan the dog poisoner  aged man and very wise
 Who was camping in the racecourse with his swag
 And who ventured the opinion to the townships great surprise
 That the race would go to Father Rileys nag
 You can talk about your riders  and the horse has not been schooled
 And the fences is terrific and the rest
 When the field is fairly going then yell see yeve all been fooled
 And the chestnut horse will battle with the best

 For theres some has got condition and they think the race is sure
 And the chestnut horse will fall beneath the weight
 But the hopes of all the helpless and the prayers of all the poor
 Will be running by his side to keep him straight
 And its whats the need of schoolin or of workin on the track
 Whin the saints are there to guide him round the course
 Ive prayed him over every fence  Ive prayed him out and back
 And Ill bet my cash on Father Rileys horse

     

 Oh the steeple was a caution They went tearin round and round
 And the fences rang and rattled where they struck
 There was some that cleared the water  there was more fell in and drowned
 Some blamed the men and others blamed the luck
 But the whips were flying freely when the field came into view
 For the finish down the long green stretch of course
 And in front of all the flyers  jumpin like a kangaroo
 Came the rank outsider  Father Rileys horse

 Oh the shouting and the cheering as he rattled past the post
 For he left the others standing in the straight
 And the rider  well they reckoned it was Andy Regans ghost
 And it beat em how a ghost would draw the weight
 But he weighed it nine stone seven then he laughed and disappeared
 Like a Banshee which is Spanish for an elf
 And old Hogan muttered sagely If it wasnt for the beard
 Theyd be thinking it was Andy Regans self

 And the poor of Kileys Crossing drank the health at Christmastide
 Of the chestnut and his rider dressed in green
 There was never such a rider not since Andy Regan died
 And they wondered who on earth he could have been
 But they settled it among em for the story got about
 Mongst the bushmen and the people on the course
 That the Devil had been ordered to let Andy Regan out
 For the steeplechase on Father Rileys horse




The Scotch Engineer



 With eyes that searched in the dark
 Peering along the line
 Stood the grim Scotchman Hector Clark
 Driver of Fortynine
 And the veldtfire flamed on the hills ahead
 Like a bloodred beacon sign

 There was word of a fight to the north
 And a column hardpressed
 So they started the Highlanders forth
 Without food without rest

 But the pipers gaily played
 Chanting their fierce delight
 And the armoured carriages rocked and swayed
 Laden with men of the Scotch Brigade
 Hurrying up to the fight
 And the grim grey Highland engineer
 Driving them into the night

 Then a signal light glowed red
 And a picket came to the track
 Enemy holding the line ahead
 Three of our mates we have left for dead
 Only we two got back
 And far to the north through the still night air
 They heard the rifles crack

 And the boom of a gun rang out
 Like the sound of a deep appeal
 And the picket stood in doubt
 By the side of the drivingwheel

 But the Engineer looked down
 With his hand on the startingbar
 Ride ye back to the town
 Ye know what my orders are
 Maybe theyre wanting the Scotch Brigade
 Up on those hills afar

 I am no soldier at all
 Only an engineer
 But I could not bear that the folk should say
 Over in Scotland  Glasgow way 
 That Hector Clark stayed here
 With the Scotch Brigade till the foe were gone
 With ever a rail to run her on
 Ready behind Stand clear

 Fireman get you gone
 Into the armoured train
 I will drive her alone
 One more trip  and perhaps the last 
 With a wellraked fire and an open blast 
 Hark to the rifles again

     

 On through the choking dark
 Never a lamp nor a light
 Never an engine spark
 Showing her hurried flight
 Over the lonely plain
 Rushed the great armoured train
 Hurrying up to the fight

 Then with her living freight
 On to the foe she came
 And the rifles snapped their hate
 And the darkness spouted flame

 Over the roar of the fray
 The hungry bullets whined
 As she dashed through the foe that lay
 Loading and firing blind
 Till the glare of the furnace burning clear
 Showed them the form of the engineer
 Sharply and well defined

 Through They were safely through
 Hark to the columns cheer
 Surely the driver knew
 He was to halt her here
 But he took no heed of the signals red
 And the fireman found when he climbed ahead
 There on the floor of his engine  dead
 Lay the Scotch Engineer




Song of the Future



 Tis strange that in a land so strong
 So strong and bold in mighty youth
 We have no poets voice of truth
 To sing for us a wondrous song

 Our chiefest singer yet has sung
 In wild sweet notes a passing strain
 All carelessly and sadly flung
 To that dull world he thought so vain

 I care for nothing good nor bad
 My hopes are gone my pleasures fled
 I am but sifting sand he said
 What wonder Gordons songs were sad

 And yet not always sad and hard
 In cheerful mood and light of heart
 He told the tale of Britomarte
 And wrote the Rhyme of Joyous Guard

 And some have said that Natures face
 To us is always sad but these
 Have never felt the smiling grace
 Of waving grass and forest trees
 On sunlit plains as wide as seas

 A land where dull Despair is king
 Oer scentless flower and songless bird
 But we have heard the bellbirds ring
 Their silver bells at eventide
 Like fairies on the mountain side
 The sweetest note man ever heard

 The wild thrush lifts a note of mirth
 The bronzewing pigeons call and coo
 Beside their nests the long day through
 The magpie warbles clear and strong
 A joyous glad thanksgiving song
 For all Gods mercies upon earth

 And many voices such as these
 Are joyful sounds for those to tell
 Who know the Bush and love it well
 With all its hidden mysteries

 We cannot love the restless sea
 That rolls and tosses to and fro
 Like some fierce creature in its glee
 For human weal or human woe
 It has no touch of sympathy

 For us the bush is never sad
 Its myriad voices whisper low
 In tones the bushmen only know
 Its sympathy and welcome glad

 For us the roving breezes bring
 From many a blossomtufted tree 
 Where wild bees murmur dreamily 
 The honeyladen breath of Spring

     

 We have no tales of other days
 No bygone history to tell
 Our tales are told where campfires blaze
 At midnight when the solemn hush
 Of that vast wonderland the Bush
 Hath laid on every heart its spell

 Although we have no songs of strife
 Of bloodshed reddening the land
 We yet may find achievements grand
 Within the bushmans quiet life

 Lift ye your faces to the sky
 Ye far blue mountains of the West
 Who lie so peacefully at rest
 Enshrouded in a haze of blue
 Tis hard to feel that years went by
 Before the pioneers broke through
 Your rocky heights and walls of stone
 And made your secrets all their own

 For years the fertile Western plains
 Were hid behind your sullen walls
 Your cliffs and crags and waterfalls
 All weatherworn with tropic rains

 Between the mountains and the sea
 Like Israelites with staff in hand
 The people waited restlessly
 They looked towards the mountains old
 And saw the sunsets come and go
 With gorgeous golden afterglow
 That made the West a fairyland
 And marvelled what that West might be
 Of which such wondrous tales were told

 For tales were told of inland seas
 Like sullen oceans salt and dead
 And sandy deserts white and wan
 Where never trod the foot of man
 Nor bird went winging overhead
 Nor ever stirred a gracious breeze
 To wake the silence with its breath 
 A land of loneliness and death

 At length the hardy pioneers
 By rock and crag found out the way
 And woke with voices of today
 A silence kept for years and years

 Upon the Western slope they stood
 And saw  a wide expanse of plain
 As far as eye could stretch or see
 Go rolling westward endlessly
 The native grasses tall as grain
 Were waved and rippled in the breeze
 From boughs of blossomladen trees
 The parrots answered back again
 They saw the land that it was good
 A land of fatness all untrod
 And gave their silent thanks to God

 The way is won The way is won
 And straightway from the barren coast
 There came a westwardmarching host
 That aye and ever onward prest
 With eager faces to the West
 Along the pathway of the sun

 The mountains saw them marching by
 They faced the allconsuming drought
 They would not rest in settled land
 But taking each his life in hand
 Their faces ever westward bent
 Beyond the farthest settlement
 Responding to the challenge cry
 Of better country further out

 And lo a miracle the land
 But yesterday was all unknown
 The wild mans boomerang was thrown
 Where now great busy cities stand
 It was not much you say that these
 Should win their way where none withstood
 In sooth there was not much of blood
 No war was fought between the seas

 It was not much but we who know
 The strange capricious land they trod 
 At times a stricken parching sod
 At times with raging floods beset 
 Through which they found their lonely way
 Are quite content that you should say
 It was not much while we can feel
 That nothing in the ages old
 In song or story written yet
 On Grecian urn or Roman arch
 Though it should ring with clash of steel
 Could braver histories unfold
 Than this bush story yet untold 
 The story of their westward march

     

 But times are changed and changes rung
 From old to new  the olden days
 The old bush life and all its ways
 Are passing from us all unsung
 The freedom and the hopeful sense
 Of toil that brought due recompense
 Of room for all has passed away
 And lies forgotten with the dead
 Within our streets men cry for bread
 In cities built but yesterday

 About us stretches wealth of land
 A boundless wealth of virgin soil
 As yet unfruitful and untilled
 Our willing workmen strong and skilled
 Within our cities idle stand
 And cry aloud for leave to toil

 The stunted children come and go
 In squalid lanes and alleys black
 We follow but the beaten track
 Of other nations and we grow
 In wealth for some  for many woe

 And it may be that we who live
 In this new land apart beyond
 The hard old world grown fierce and fond
 And bound by precedent and bond
 May read the riddle right and give
 New hope to those who dimly see
 That all things may be yet for good
 And teach the world at length to be
 One vast united brotherhood

     

 So may it be and he who sings
 In accents hopeful clear and strong
 The glories which that future brings
 Shall sing indeed a wondrous song




Anthony Considine



 Out in the wastes of the West countrie
 Out where the white stars shine
 Grim and silent as such men be
 Rideth a man with a history 
 Anthony Considine

 For the ways of men they are manifold
 As their differing views in life
 For some are sold for the lust of gold
 And some for the lust of strife
 But this man counted the world well lost
 For the love of his neighbours wife

 They fled together as those must flee
 Whom all men hold in blame
 Each to the other must all things be
 Who cross the gulf of iniquity
 And live in the land of shame

 But a lightolove if she sins with one
 She sinneth with ninetynine
 The rule holds good since the world begun 
 Since ever the streams began to run
 And the stars began to shine
 The rule holds true and he found it true 
 Anthony Considine

 A nobler spirit had turned in scorn
 From a love that was stained with mire
 A weaker being might mourn and mourn
 For the loss of his Hearts Desire
 But the anger of Anthony Considine
 Blazed up like a flaming fire

 And she with her new love presently
 Came past with her eyes ashine
 And God so willed it and God knows why
 She turned and laughed as they passed him by 
 Anthony Considine

 Her laughter stung as a whip might sting
 And mad with his wounded pride
 He turned and sprang with a panthers spring
 And struck at his rivals side
 And only the woman shuddering
 Could tell how the dead man died

 She dared not speak  and the mystery
 Is buried in auld lang syne
 But out on the wastes of the West countrie
 Grim and silent as such men be
 Rideth a man with a history 
 Anthony Considine




Song of the Artesian Water



 Now the stock have started dying for the Lord has sent a drought
 But were sick of prayers and Providence  were going to do without
 With the derricks up above us and the solid earth below
 We are waiting at the lever for the word to let her go
 Sinking down deeper down
 Oh well sink it deeper down
 As the drill is plugging downward at a thousand feet of level
 If the Lord wont send us water oh well get it from the devil
 Yes well get it from the devil deeper down

 Now our engines built in Glasgow by a very canny Scot
 And he marked it twenty horsepower but he dont know what is what
 When Canadian Bill is firing with the sundried gidgee logs
 She can equal thirty horses and a score or so of dogs
 Sinking down deeper down
 Oh were going deeper down
 If we fail to get the water then its ruin to the squatter
 For the drought is on the station and the weathers growing hotter
 But were bound to get the water deeper down

 But the shaft has started caving and the sinkings very slow
 And the yellow rods are bending in the water down below
 And the tubes are always jamming and they cant be made to shift
 Till we nearly burst the engine with a forty horsepower lift
 Sinking down deeper down
 Oh were going deeper down
 Though the shaft is always caving and the tubes are always jamming
 Yet well fight our way to water while the stubborn drill is ramming 
 While the stubborn drill is ramming deeper down

 But theres no artesian water though weve passed three thousand feet
 And the contract price is growing and the boss is nearly beat
 But it must be down beneath us and its down weve got to go
 Though shes bumping on the solid rock four thousand feet below
 Sinking down deeper down
 Oh were going deeper down
 And its time they heard us knocking on the roof of Satans dwellin
 But well get artesian water if we cave the roof of hell in 
 Oh well get artesian water deeper down

 But its hark the whistles blowing with a wild exultant blast
 And the boys are madly cheering for theyve struck the flow at last
 And its rushing up the tubing from four thousand feet below
 Till it spouts above the casing in a milliongallon flow
 And its down deeper down 
 Oh it comes from deeper down
 It is flowing ever flowing in a free unstinted measure
 From the silent hidden places where the old earth hides her treasure 
 Where the old earth hides her treasure deeper down

 And its clear away the timber and its let the water run
 How it glimmers in the shadow how it flashes in the sun
 By the silent belts of timber by the miles of blazing plain
 It is bringing hope and comfort to the thirsty land again
 Flowing down further down
 It is flowing further down
 To the tortured thirsty cattle bringing gladness in its going
 Through the droughty days of summer it is flowing ever flowing 
 It is flowing ever flowing further down




A Disqualified Jockeys Story



 You see the thing was this way  there was me
 That rode Panoppoly the Splendor mare
 And Ikey Chambers on the Iron Dook
 And Smith the halfcaste rider on Regret
 And that long bloke from Wagga  him what rode
 Veronikew the Snowy River horse
 Well none of them had chances  not a chance
 Among the lot unless the rest fell dead
 Or wasnt trying  for a blind mans dog
 Could see Enchantress was a certain cop
 And all the books was layin six to four

 They brought her out to show our lot the road
 Or so they said but then Gords truth you know
 You cant believe em though they took an oath
 On forty Bibles that theyd tell the truth
 But anyhow an amateur was up
 On this Enchantress and so Ike and me
 We thought that we might frighten him a bit
 By asking if he minded riding rough 
 Oh not at all says he oh not at all
 I learnt at Robbo Park and if it comes
 To bumping Im your Moses Strike me blue
 Says he Ill bump you over either rail
 The inside rail or outside  which you choose
 Is good enough for me  which settled Ike
 For he was shaky since he near got killed
 From being sent a buster on the rail
 When some chap bumped his horse and fetched him down
 At Stony Bridge so Ikey thought it best
 To leave this bloke alone and I agreed

 So all the books was layin six to four
 Against the favourite and the amateur
 Was walking this Enchantress up and down
 And me and Smithy backed him for we thought
 We might as well get something for ourselves
 Because we knew our horses couldnt win
 But Ikey wouldnt back him for a bob
 Because he said he reckoned he was stiff
 And all the books was layin six to four

 Well anyhow before the start the news
 Got round that this here amateur was stiff
 And our good stuff was blued and all the books
 Was in it and the prices lengthened out
 And every book was bustin of his throat
 And layin five to one the favourite
 So there was we that couldnt win ourselves
 And this here amateur that wouldnt try
 And all the books was layin five to one

 So Smithy says to me You take a hold
 Of that there moke of yours and round the turn
 Come up behind Enchantress with the whip
 And let her have it that long bloke and me
 Will wait ahead and when she comes to us
 Well pass her on and belt her down the straight
 And Ikeyll flog her home because his boss
 Is judge and steward and the Lord knows what
 And so he wont be touched  and as for us
 Well swear we only hit her by mistake
 And all the books was layin five to one

 Well off we went and comin to the turn
 I saw the amateur was holding back
 And poking into every hole he could
 To get her blocked and so I pulled behind
 And drew the whip and dropped it on the mare 
 I let her have it twice and then she shot
 Ahead of me and Smithy opened out
 And let her up beside him on the rails
 And kept her there abeltin her like smoke
 Until she struggled past him pullin hard
 And came to Ike but Ikey drew his whip
 And hit her on the nose and sent her back
 And won the race himself  for after all
 It seems he had a fiver on the Dook
 And never told us  so our stuff was lost
 And then they had us up for ridin foul
 And warned us off the tracks for twelve months each
 To get our livin any way we could
 But Ikey wasnt touched because his boss
 Was judge and steward and the Lord knows what

 But Mister  if youll lend us halfacrown
 I know three certain winners at the Park 
 Three certain cops as no one knows but me
 And  thank you Mister come an have a beer
 I always like a beer about this time   
 Well so long Mister till we meet again




The Road to Gundagai



 The mountain road goes up and down
 From Gundagai to Tumut Town

 And branching off there runs a track
 Across the foothills grim and black

 Across the plains and ranges grey
 To Sydney city far away

     

 It came by chance one day that I
 From Tumut rode to Gundagai

 And reached about the evening tide
 The crossing where the roads divide

 And waiting at the crossing place
 I saw a maiden fair of face

 With eyes of deepest violet blue
 And cheeks to match the rose in hue 

 The fairest maids Australia knows
 Are bred among the mountain snows

 Then fearing I might go astray
 I asked if she could show the way

 Her voice might well a man bewitch 
 Its tones so supple deep and rich

 The tracks are clear she made reply
 And this goes down to Sydney town
 And that one goes to Gundagai

 Then slowly looking coyly back
 She went along the Sydney track

 And I for one was well content
 To go the road the lady went

 But round the turn a swain she met 
 The kiss she gave him haunts me yet

     

 I turned and travelled with a sigh
 The lonely road to Gundagai




Saltbush Bills Second Fight



 The news came down on the Castlereagh and went to the world at large
 That twenty thousand travelling sheep with Saltbush Bill in charge
 Were drifting down from a driedout run to ravage the Castlereagh
 And the squatters swore when they heard the news
 and wished they were well away
 For the name and the fame of Saltbush Bill were over the country side
 For the wonderful way that he fed his sheep
 and the dodges and tricks he tried
 He would lose his way on a Main Stock Route
 and stray to the squatters grass
 He would come to a run with the boss away and swear he had leave to pass
 And back of all and behind it all as well the squatters knew
 If he had to fight he would fight all day so long as his sheep got through
 But this is the story of Stingy Smith the owner of Hard Times Hill
 And the way that he chanced on a fighting man to reckon with Saltbush Bill

     

 Twas Stingy Smith on his stockyard sat and prayed for an early Spring
 When he stared at sight of a cleanshaved tramp who walked with jaunty swing
 For a cleanshaved tramp with a jaunty walk aswinging along the track
 Is as rare a thing as a feathered frog on the desolate roads out back
 So the tramp he made for the travellers hut
 and asked could he camp the night
 But Stingy Smith had a bright idea and he said to him Can you fight
 Why whats the game said the cleanshaved tramp
 as he looked at him up and down 
 If you want a battle get off that fence and Ill kill you for halfacrown
 But Boss youd better not fight with me it wouldnt be fair nor right
 Im Stiffener Joe from the Rocks Brigade and I killed a man in a fight
 I served two years for it fair and square and now Im a trampin back
 To look for a peaceful quiet life away on the outside track 
 Oh its not myself but a drover chap said Stingy Smith with glee
 A bullying fellow called Saltbush Bill  and you are the man for me
 Hes on the road with his hungry sheep and hes certain to raise a row
 For hes bullied the whole of the Castlereagh till hes got them under cow 
 Just pick a quarrel and raise a fight and leather him good and hard
 And Ill take good care that his wretched sheep dont wander a half a yard
 Its a fivepound job if you belt him well  do anything short of kill
 For there isnt a beak on the Castlereagh will fine you for Saltbush Bill

 Ill take the job said the fighting man and hot as this cove appears
 Hell stand no chance with a bloke like me
 whats lived on the game for years
 For hes maybe learnt in a boxing school and sparred for a round or so
 But Ive fought all hands in a tenfoot ring each night in a travelling show
 They earned a pound if they stayed three rounds
 and they tried for it every night 
 In a tenfoot ring Oh thats the game that teaches a bloke to fight
 For theyd rush and clinch it was Dublin Rules and we drew no colour line
 And they all tried hard for to earn the pound but they got no pound of mine
 If I saw no chance in the opening round Id slog at their wind and wait
 Till an opening came  and it ALWAYS came  and I settled em sure as fate
 Left on the ribs and right on the jaw 
 and when the chance comes MAKE SURE
 And its there a professional bloke like me gets home on an amateur
 For its my experience every day and I make no doubt its yours
 That a thirdclass pro is an overmatch for the best of the amateurs 
 Oh take your swag to the travellers hut
 said Smith for you waste your breath
 Youve a firstclass chance if you lose the fight
 of talking your man to death
 Ill tell the cook youre to have your grub and see that you eat your fill
 And come to the scratch all fit and well to leather this Saltbush Bill

     

 Twas Saltbush Bill and his travelling sheep were wending their weary way
 On the Main Stock Route through the Hard Times Run
 on their sixmile stage a day
 And he strayed a mile from the Main Stock Route and started to feed along
 And when Stingy Smith came up Bill said that the Route was surveyed wrong
 And he tried to prove that the sheep had rushed
 and strayed from their camp at night
 But the fighting man he kicked Bills dog and of course that meant a fight
 So they sparred and fought and they shifted ground
 and never a sound was heard
 But the thudding fists on their brawny ribs and the seconds muttered word
 Till the fighting man shot home his left on the ribs with a mighty clout
 And his right flashed up with a halfarm blow  and Saltbush Bill went out
 He fell face down and towards the blow
 and their hearts with fear were filled
 For he lay as still as a fallen tree and they thought that he must be killed
 So Stingy Smith and the fighting man they lifted him from the ground
 And sent to home for a brandyflask and they slowly fetched him round
 But his head was bad and his jaw was hurt 
 in fact he could scarcely speak 
 So they let him spell till he got his wits and he camped on the run a week
 While the travelling sheep went here and there wherever they liked to stray
 Till Saltbush Bill was fit once more for the track to the Castlereagh

     

 Then Stingy Smith he wrote a note and gave to the fighting man
 Twas writ to the boss of the neighbouring run and thus the missive ran
 The man with this is a fighting man one Stiffener Joe by name
 He came near murdering Saltbush Bill and I found it a costly game
 But its worth your while to employ the chap
 for there isnt the slightest doubt
 Youll have no trouble from Saltbush Bill while this man hangs about 
 But an answer came by the next weeks mail with news that might well appal
 The man you sent with a note is not a fighting man at all
 He has shaved his beard and has cut his hair but I spotted him at a look
 He is Tom Devine who has worked for years for Saltbush Bill as cook
 Bill coached him up in the fighting yarn and taught him the tale by rote
 And they shammed to fight and they got your grass
 and divided your fivepound note
 Twas a clean takein and youll find it wise 
 twill save you a lot of pelf 
 When next youre hiring a fighting man just fight him a round yourself

     

 And the teamsters out on the Castlereagh when they meet with a week of rain
 And the waggon sinks to its axletree deep down in the black soil plain
 When the bullocks wade in a sea of mud and strain at the load of wool
 And the cattledogs at the bullocks heels are biting to make them pull
 When the offside driver flays the team and curses them while he flogs
 And the air is thick with the language used
 and the clamour of men and dogs 
 The teamsters say as they pause to rest and moisten each hairy throat
 They wish they could swear like Stingy Smith
 when he read that neighbours note




Hard Luck



 I left the course and by my side
 There walked a ruined tout 
 A hungry creature evileyed
 Who poured this story out

 You see he said there came a swell
 To Kensington today
 And if I picked the winners well
 A crown at least hed pay

 I picked three winners straight I did
 I filled his purse with pelf
 And then he gave me halfaquid
 To back one for myself

 A halfaquid to me he cast
 I wanted it indeed
 So help me Bob for two days past
 I havent had a feed

 But still I thought my luck was in
 I couldnt go astray
 I put it all on Little Min
 And lost it straightaway

 I havent got a bite or bed
 Im absolutely stuck
 So keep this lesson in your head
 Dont overtrust your luck

 The folks went homeward near and far
 The tout Oh where was he
 Ask where the empty boilers are
 Beside the Circular Quay




Song of the Federation



 As the nations sat together grimly waiting 
 The fierce old nations battlescarred 
 Grown grey in their lusting and their hating
 Ever armed and ever ready keeping guard
 Through the tumult of their warlike preparation
 And the halfstilled clamour of the drums
 Came a voice crying Lo a newmade nation
 To her place in the sisterhood she comes

 And she came  she was beautiful as morning
 With the bloom of the roses in her mouth
 Like a young queen lavishly adorning
 Her charms with the splendours of the South
 And the fierce old nations looking on her
 Said Nay surely she were quickly overthrown
 Hath she strength for the burden laid upon her
 Hath she power to protect and guard her own

 Then she spoke and her voice was clear and ringing
 In the ears of the nations old and gray
 Saying Hark and ye shall hear my children singing
 Their warsong in countries far away
 They are strangers to the tumult of the battle
 They are few but their hearts are very strong
 Twas but yesterday they called unto the cattle
 But they now sing Australias marching song


 Song of the Australians in Action


 For the honour of Australia our mother
 Side by side with our kin from over sea
 We have fought and we have tested one another
 And enrolled among the brotherhood are we

 There was never post of danger but we sought it
 In the fighting through the fire and through the flood
 There was never prize so costly but we bought it
 Though we paid for its purchase with our blood

 Was there any road too rough for us to travel
 Was there any path too far for us to tread
 You can track us by the blood drops on the gravel
 On the roads that we milestoned with our dead

 And for you oh our young and anxious mother
 Oer your great gains keeping watch and ward
 Neither fearing nor despising any other
 We will hold your possessions with the sword

     

 Then they passed to the place of worldlong sleeping
 The greyclad figures with their dead
 To the sound of their women softly weeping
 And the Dead March moaning at their head
 And the Nations as the grim procession ended
 Whispered Child But ye have seen the price we pay
 From War may we ever be defended
 Kneel ye down newmade Sister  Let us Pray




The Old Australian Ways



 The London lights are far abeam
 Behind a bank of cloud
 Along the shore the gaslights gleam
 The gale is piping loud
 And down the Channel groping blind
 We drive her through the haze
 Towards the land we left behind 
 The good old land of never mind
 And old Australian ways

 The narrow ways of English folk
 Are not for such as we
 They bear the longaccustomed yoke
 Of staid conservancy
 But all our roads are new and strange
 And through our blood there runs
 The vagabonding love of change
 That drove us westward of the range
 And westward of the suns

 The city folk go to and fro
 Behind a prisons bars
 They never feel the breezes blow
 And never see the stars
 They never hear in blossomed trees
 The music low and sweet
 Of wild birds making melodies
 Nor catch the little laughing breeze
 That whispers in the wheat

 Our fathers came of roving stock
 That could not fixed abide
 And we have followed field and flock
 Since eer we learnt to ride
 By miners camp and shearing shed
 In land of heat and drought
 We followed where our fortunes led
 With fortune always on ahead
 And always further out

 The wind is in the barleygrass
 The wattles are in bloom
 The breezes greet us as they pass
 With honeysweet perfume
 The parakeets go screaming by
 With flash of golden wing
 And from the swamp the wildducks cry
 Their longdrawn note of revelry
 Rejoicing at the Spring

 So throw the weary pen aside
 And let the papers rest
 For we must saddle up and ride
 Towards the blue hills breast
 And we must travel far and fast
 Across their rugged maze
 To find the Spring of Youth at last
 And call back from the buried past
 The old Australian ways

 When Clancy took the drovers track
 In years of long ago
 He drifted to the outer back
 Beyond the Overflow
 By rolling plain and rocky shelf
 With stockwhip in his hand
 He reached at last oh lucky elf
 The Town of Comeandhelpyourself
 In Roughandready Land

 And if it be that you would know
 The tracks he used to ride
 Then you must saddle up and go
 Beyond the Queensland side 
 Beyond the reach of rule or law
 To ride the long day through
 In Natures homestead  filled with awe
 You then might see what Clancy saw
 And know what Clancy knew




The Ballad of the Calliope



 By the far Samoan shore
 Where the leaguelong rollers pour
 All the wash of the Pacific on the coralguarded bay
 Riding lightly at their ease
 In the calm of tropic seas
 The three great nations warships at their anchors proudly lay

 Riding lightly head to wind
 With the coral reefs behind
 Three Germans and three Yankee ships were mirrored in the blue
 And on one ship unfurled
 Was the flag that rules the world 
 For on the old Calliope the flag of England flew

 When the gentle offshore breeze
 That had scarcely stirred the trees
 Dropped down to utter stillness and the glass began to fall
 Away across the main
 Lowered the coming hurricane
 And far away to seaward hung the cloud wrack like a pall

 If the word had passed around
 Let us move to safer ground
 Let us steam away to seaward  then this tale were not to tell
 But each Captain seemed to say
 If the others stay I stay
 And they lingered at their moorings till the shades of evening fell

 Then the cloud wrack neared them fast
 And there came a sudden blast
 And the hurricane came leaping down a thousand miles of main
 Like a lion on its prey
 Leapt the storm fiend on the bay
 And the vessels shook and shivered as their cables felt the strain

 As the surging seas came by
 That were running mountains high
 The vessels started dragging drifting slowly to the lee
 And the darkness of the night
 Hid the coral reefs from sight
 And the Captains dared not risk the chance to grope their way to sea

 In the dark they dared not shift
 They were forced to wait and drift
 All hands stood by uncertain would the anchors hold or no
 But the men on deck could see
 If a chance of hope might be 
 There was little chance of safety for the men who were below

 Through that long long night of dread
 While the storm raged overhead
 They were waiting by their engines with the furnace fires aroar
 So they waited staunch and true
 Though they knew and well they knew
 They must drown like rats imprisoned if the vessel touched the shore

 When the grey dawn broke at last
 And the long long night was past
 While the hurricane redoubled lest its prey should steal away
 On the rocks all smashed and strewn
 Were the German vessels thrown
 While the Yankees swamped and helpless drifted shorewards down the bay

 Then at last spoke Captain Kane
 All our anchors are in vain
 And the Germans and the Yankees they have drifted to the lee
 Cut the cables at the bow
 We must trust the engines now
 Give her steam and let her have it lads well fight her out to sea

 And the answer came with cheers
 From the stalwart engineers
 From the grim and grimy firemen at the furnaces below
 And above the sullen roar
 Of the breakers on the shore
 Came the throbbing of the engines as they laboured to and fro

 If the strain should find a flaw
 Should a bolt or rivet draw
 Then  God help them for the vessel were a plaything in the tide
 With a face of honest cheer
 Quoth an English engineer
 I will answer for the engines that were built on old Thames side

 For the stays and stanchions taut
 For the rivets truly wrought
 For the valves that fit their faces as a glove should fit the hand
 Give her every ounce of power
 If we make a knot an hour
 Then its way enough to steer her and well drive her from the land

 Like a foam flake tossed and thrown
 She could barely hold her own
 While the other ships all helplessly were drifting to the lee
 Through the smother and the rout
 The Calliope steamed out 
 And they cheered her from the Trenton that was foundering in the sea

 Aye drifting shoreward there
 All helpless as they were
 Their vessel hurled upon the reefs as weed ashore is hurled
 Without a thought of fear
 The Yankees raised a cheer 
 A cheer that Englishspeaking folk should echo round the world




Do They Know



 Do they know At the turn to the straight
 Where the favourites fail
 And every atom of weight
 Is telling its tale
 As some grim old stayer hardpressed
 Runs true to his breed
 And with head just in front of the rest
 Fights on in the lead
 When the jockeys are out with the whips
 With a furlong to go
 And the backers grow white to the lips 
 Do you think THEY dont know

 Do they know As they come back to weigh
 In a whirlwind of cheers
 Though the spurs have left marks of the fray
 Though the sweat on the ears
 Gathers cold and they sob with distress
 As they roll up the track
 They know just as well their success
 As the man on their back
 As they walk through a dense human lane
 That sways to and fro
 And cheers them again and again
 Do you think THEY dont know




The Passing of Gundagai



 Ill introdooce a friend he said
 And if youve got a vacant pen
 Youd better take him in the shed
 And start him shearing straight ahead
 Hes one of these here quiet men

 He never strikes  that aint his game
 No matter what the others try
 HE goes on shearing just the same
 I never rightly knew his name 
 We always call him Gundagai

 Our flashest shearer then had gone
 To train a racehorse for a race
 And while his sporting fit was on
 He couldnt be relied upon
 So Gundagai shore in his place

 Alas for mans veracity
 For reputations false and true
 This Gundagai turned out to be
 For strife and allround villainy
 The very worst I ever knew

 He started racing Jack Devine
 And grumbled when I made him stop
 The pace he showed was extra fine
 But all those purebred ewes of mine
 Were bleeding like a butchers shop

 He cursed the sheep he cursed the shed
 From roof to rafter floor to shelf
 As for my mongrel ewes he said
 I ought to get a razor blade
 And shave the blooming things myself

 On Sundays he controlled a school
 And played twoup the livelong day
 And many a young confiding fool
 He shore of his financial wool
 And when he lost he would not pay

 He organised a shearers race
 And touched me to provide the prize
 His packhorse showed surprising pace
 And won hands down  he was The Ace
 A wellknown racehorse in disguise

 Next day the bruiser of the shed
 Displayed an opaltinted eye
 With large contusions on his head
 He smiled a sickly smile and said
 Hed had a cut at Gundagai

 But just as we were getting full
 Of Gundagai and all his ways
 A telegram for Henry Bull
 Arrived Said he Thats me  all wool
 Lets see what this here message says

 He opened it his face grew white
 He dropped the shears and turned away
 It ran Your wife took bad last night
 Come home at once  no time to write
 We fear she may not last the day

 He got his cheque  I didnt care
 To dock him for my mangled ewes
 His store account  we called it square
 Poor wretch he had enough to bear
 Confronted by such dreadful news

 The shearers raised a little purse
 To help a mate as shearers will
 To pay the doctor and the nurse
 And if there should be something worse 
 To pay the undertakers bill

 They wrung his hand in sympathy
 He rode away without a word
 His head hung down in misery
 A wandering hawker passing by
 Was told of what had just occurred

 Well thats a curious thing he said
 Ive known that feller all his life 
 Hes had the loan of this here shed
 I know his wife aint nearly dead
 Because he HASNT GOT A WIFE

     

 You should have heard the whipcord crack
 As angry shearers galloped by
 In vain they tried to fetch him back
 A little dust along the track
 Was all they saw of Gundagai




The Wargeilah Handicap



 Wargeilah town is very small
 Theres no cathedral nor a club
 In fact the township all in all
 Is just one unpretentious pub
 And there from all the stations round
 The local sportsmen can be found

 The sportsmen of Wargeilah side
 Are very few but very fit
 Theres scarcely any sport been tried
 But what they held their own at it
 In fact to search their records oer
 They held their own and something more

 Twas round about Wargeilah town
 An English newchum did infest
 He used to wander up and down
 In baggy English breeches drest 
 His mental aspect seemed to be
 Just stolid selfsufficiency

 The local sportsmen vainly sought
 His tranquil calm to counteract
 By urging that he should be brought
 Within the Noxious Creatures Act
 Nay harm him not said one more wise
 He is a blessing in disguise

 You see he wants to buy a horse
 To ride and hunt and steeplechase
 And carry ladies too of course
 And pull a cart and win a race
 Good gracious he must be a flat
 To think hell get a horse like that

 But since he has so little sense
 And such a lot of cash to burn
 Well sell him some experience
 By which alone a fool can learn
 Suppose we let him have The Trap
 To win Wargeilah Handicap

 And here I must explain to you
 That round about Wargeilah run
 There lived a very aged screw
 Whose days of brilliancy were done
 A grand old warrior in his prime 
 But age will beat us all in time

 A troopers horse in seasons past
 He did his share to keep the peace
 But took to falling and at last
 Was cast for age from the Police
 A publican at Conroys Gap
 Then bought and christened him The Trap

 When grass was good and horses dear
 He changed his owner now and then
 At prices ranging somewhere near
 The neighbourhood of two pound ten
 And manfully he earned his keep
 By yarding cows and ration sheep

 They brought him in from off the grass
 And fed and groomed the old horse up
 His coat began to shine like glass 
 Youd think hed win the Melbourne Cup
 And when theyd got him fat and flash
 They asked the newchum  fifty  cash

 And when he said the price was high
 Their indignation knew no bounds
 They said Its seldom you can buy
 A horse like that for fifty pounds
 Well refund twenty if The Trap
 Should fail to win the handicap

 The deed was done the price was paid
 The newchum put the horse in train
 The local sports were much afraid
 That he would sad experience gain
 By racing with some shearers hack
 Whod beat him halfway round the track

 So on this guileless English spark
 They did most fervently impress
 That he must keep the matter dark
 And not let any person guess
 That he was purchasing The Trap
 To win Wargeilah Handicap

 They spoke of spielers from The Bland
 And champions from the Castlereagh
 And gave the youth to understand
 That all of these would stop away
 And spoil the race if they should hear
 That they had got The Trap to fear

 Keep dark Theyll muster thick as flies
 When once the news gets sent around
 Were giving such a splendid prize 
 A Snowdon horse worth fifty pound
 Theyll come right in from Dandaloo
 And find  that its a gift to you

     

 The race came on  with no display
 Nor any calling of the card
 But round about the pub all day
 A crowd of shearers drinking hard
 And using language in a strain
 Twere flattery to call profane

 Our hero dressed in silk attire 
 Blue jacket and a scarlet cap 
 With boots that shone like flames of fire
 Now did his canter on The Trap
 And walked him up and round about
 Until the other steeds came out

 He eyed them with a haughty look
 But saw a sight that caught his breath
 It was Ah John The Chinee cook
 In boots and breeches Pale as death
 Tied with a rope like any sack
 Upon a piebald ponys back

 The next a colt  all mud and burrs
 Halfbroken with a black boy up
 Who said You gimme pair o spurs
 I win the bloomin Melbourne Cup
 These two were to oppose The Trap
 For the Wargeilah Handicap

 Theyre off The colt whipped down his head
 And humped his back and gave a squeal
 And bucked into the drinking shed
 Revolving like a Cathrine wheel
 Men ran like rats The atmosphere
 Was filled with oaths and pints of beer

 But up the course the bold Ah John
 Beside The Trap raced neck and neck
 The boys had tied him firmly on
 Which ultimately proved his wreck
 The saddle turned and like a clown
 He rode some distance upside down

 His legs around the horse were tied
 His feet towards the heavens were spread
 He swung and bumped at every stride
 And ploughed the ground up with his head
 And when they rescued him The Trap
 Had won Wargeilah Handicap

 And no enquiries we could make
 Could tell by what false statements swayed
 Ah John was led to undertake
 A task so foreign to his trade
 He only smiled and said Hoo Ki
 I stop topside I win all li

 But never in Wargeilah Town
 Was heard so eloquent a cheer
 As when the President came down
 And toasted in Colonial Beer
 The finest rider on the course
 The winner of the Snowdon Horse

 You go and get your prize he said
 Hes with a wild mob somewhere round
 The mountains near The Watershed
 Hes honestly worth fifty pound
 A noble horse indeed to win
 But none of US can run him in

 Weve chased him poor weve chased him fat
 Weve run him till our horses dropped
 But by such obstacles as that
 A man like you will not be stopped
 Youll go and yard him any day
 So heres your health Hooray Hooray

     

 The day wound up with booze and blow
 And fights till all were well content
 But of the newchum all I know
 Is shown by this advertisement 
 For Sale the wellknown racehorse Trap
 He won Wargeilah Handicap




Any Other Time



 All of us play our very best game 
 Any other time
 Golf or billiards its all the same 
 Any other time
 Lose a match and you always say
 Just my luck I was off today
 I could have beaten him quite halfway 
 Any other time

 After a fiver you ought to go 
 Any other time
 Every man that you ask says Oh
 Any OTHER time
 Lend you a fiver Id lend you two
 But Im overdrawn and my bills are due
 Wish youd ask me  now mind you do 
 Any other time

 Fellows will ask you out to dine 
 Any other time
 Not tonight for were twentynine 
 Any other time
 Not tomorrow for cooks on strike
 Not next day Ill be out on the bike 
 Just drop in whenever you like 
 Any other time

 Seasick passengers like the sea 
 Any other time
 Something   I ate   disagreed   with me
 Any other time
 Oceantravlling is   simply bliss
 Must be my   liver   has gone amiss  
 Why I would   laugh   at a sea   like this 
 Any other time

     

 Most of us mean to be better men 
 Any other time
 Regular upright characters then 
 Any other time
 Yet somehow as the years go by
 Still we gamble and drink and lie
 When it comes to the last well want to die 
 Any other time




The Last Trump



 You led the trump the old man said
 With fury in his eye
 And yet you hope my girl to wed
 Young man your hopes of love are fled
 Twere better she should die

 My sweet young daughter sitting there
 So innocent and plump
 You dont suppose that she would care
 To wed an outlawed man whod dare
 To lead the thirteenth trump

 If you had drawn their leading spade
 It meant a certain win
 But no By Pembrokes mighty shade
 The thirteenth trump you went and played
 And let their diamonds in

 My girl Return at my command
 His presents in a lump
 Return his ring For understand
 No man is fit to hold your hand
 Who leads a thirteenth trump

 But hold Give every man his due
 And every dog his day
 Speak up and say what made you do
 This dreadful thing  that is if you
 Have anything to say

 He spoke I meant at first said he
 To give their spades a bump
 Or lead the hearts but then you see
 I thought against us there might be
 Perhaps a fourteenth trump

     

 They buried him at dawn of day
 Beside a ruined stump
 And there he sleeps the hours away
 And waits for Gabriel to play
 The last  the fourteenth  trump




Tar and Feathers



 Oh the circus swooped down
 On the Narrabri town
 For the Narrabri populace moneyed are
 And the showman he smiled
 At the folk he beguiled
 To come all the distance from Gunnedah

 But a juvenile smart
 Who objected to part
 Went in on the nod and to do it he
 Crawled in through a crack
 In the tent at the back
 For the boy had no slight ingenuity

 And says he with a grin
 Thats the way to get in
 But I reckon Id better be quiet or
 Theyll spiflicate me
 And he chuckled for he
 Had the loan of the circus proprietor

 But the showman astute
 On that wily galoot
 Soon dropped and youll say that he leathered him 
 Not he with a grim
 Sort of humorous whim
 He took him and tarred him and feathered him

 Says he You can go
 Round the world with a show
 And knock every Injun and Arab wry
 With your name and your trade
 On the posters displayed
 The feathered whatisit from Narrabri

 Next day for his freak
 By a Narrabri beak
 He was jawed with a deal of verbosity
 For his only appeal
 Was professional zeal 
 He wanted another monstrosity

 Said his worship Begob
 You are fined forty bob
 And six shillins costs to the clurk he says
 And the Narrabri joy
 Half bird and half boy
 Has a down on himself and on circuses




Its Grand



 Its grand to be a squatter
 And sit upon a post
 And watch your little ewes and lambs
 Agiving up the ghost

 Its grand to be a cockie
 With wife and kids to keep
 And find an allwise Providence
 Has mustered all your sheep

 Its grand to be a Western man
 With shovel in your hand
 To dig your little homestead out
 From underneath the sand

 Its grand to be a shearer
 Along the Darling side
 And pluck the wool from stinking sheep
 That some days since have died

 Its grand to be a rabbit
 And breed till all is blue
 And then to die in heaps because
 Theres nothing left to chew

 Its grand to be a Minister
 And travel like a swell
 And tell the Central District folk
 To go to  Inverell

 Its grand to be a Socialist
 And lead the bold array
 That marches to prosperity
 At seven bob a day

 Its grand to be an unemployed
 And lie in the Domain
 And wake up every second day
 And go to sleep again

 Its grand to borrow English tin
 To pay for wharves and Rocks
 And then to find it isnt in
 The little moneybox

 Its grand to be a democrat
 And toady to the mob
 For fear that if you told the truth
 Theyd hunt you from your job

 Its grand to be a lot of things
 In this fair Southern land
 But if the Lord would send us rain
 That would indeed be grand




Out of Sight



 They held a polo meeting at a little country town
 And all the local sportsmen came to win themselves renown
 There came two strangers with a horse and I am much afraid
 They both belonged to what is called the takeyoudown brigade

 They said their horse could jump like fun and asked an amateur
 To ride him in the steeplechase and told him they were sure
 The last time round hed sail away with such a swallows flight
 The rest would never see him go  hed finish out of sight

 So out he went and when folk saw the amateur was up
 Some local genius called the race the dudeindanger cup
 The horse was known as Whos Afraid by Panic from The Fright
 But still his owners told the jock hed finish out of sight

 And so he did for Whos Afraid without the least pretence
 Disposed of him by rushing through the very second fence
 And when they ran the last time round the prophecy was right 
 For he was in the ambulance and safely out of sight




The Road to Old Mans Town



 The fields of youth are filled with flowers
 The wine of youth is strong
 What need have we to count the hours
 The summer days are long

 But soon we find to our dismay
 That we are drifting down
 The barren slopes that fall away
 Towards the foothills grim and grey
 That lead to Old Mans Town

 And marching with us on the track
 Full many friends we find
 We see them looking sadly back
 For those that dropped behind

 But God forbid a fate so dread 
 ALONE to travel down
 The dreary road we all must tread
 With faltering steps and whitening head
 The road to Old Mans Town




The Old Timers Steeplechase



 The sheep were shorn and the wool went down
 At the time of our local racing
 And Id earned a spell  I was burnt and brown 
 So I rolled my swag for a trip to town
 And a look at the steeplechasing

 Twas rough and ready  an uncleared course
 As rough as the blacks had found it
 With barbedwire fences topped with gorse
 And a waterjump that would drown a horse
 And the steeple three times round it

 There was never a fence the tracks to guard 
 Some straggling posts defined em
 And the day was hot and the drinking hard
 Till none of the stewards could see a yard
 Before nor yet behind em

 But the bell was rung and the nags were out
 Excepting an old outsider
 Whose trainer started an awful rout
 For his boy had gone on a drinking bout
 And left him without a rider

 Is there not one man in the crowd he cried
 In the whole of the crowd so clever
 Is there not one man that will take a ride
 On the old white horse from the Northern side
 That was bred on the Mooki River

 Twas an old white horse that they called The Cow
 And a cow would look well beside him
 But I was pluckier then than now
 And I wanted excitement anyhow
 So at last I agreed to ride him

 And the trainer said Well hes dreadful slow
 And he hasnt a chance whatever
 But Im stony broke so its time to show
 A trick or two that the trainers know
 Who train by the Mooki River

 The first time round at the further side
 With the trees and the scrub about you
 Just pull behind them and run out wide
 And then dodge into the scrub and hide
 And let them go round without you

 At the third time round for the final spin
 With the pace and the dust to blind em
 Theyll never notice if you chip in
 For the last halfmile  youll be sure to win
 And theyll think you raced behind em

 At the waterjump you may have to swim 
 He hasnt a hope to clear it 
 Unless he skims like the swallows skim
 At full speed over but not for him
 Hell never go next or near it

 But dont you worry  just plunge across
 For he swims like a welltrained setter
 Then hide away in the scrub and gorse
 The rest will be far ahead of course 
 The further ahead the better

 You must rush the jumps in the last halfround
 For fear that he might refuse em
 Hell try to baulk with you Ill be bound
 Take whip and spurs on the mean old hound
 And dont be afraid to use em

 At the final round when the field are slow
 And you are quite fresh to meet em
 Sit down and hustle him all you know
 With the whip and spurs and hell have to go 
 Remember youve GOT to beat em

     

 The flag went down and we seemed to fly
 And we made the timbers shiver
 Of the first big fence as the stand flashed by
 And I caught the ring of the trainers cry
 Go on For the Mooki River

 I jammed him in with a wellpacked crush
 And recklessly  out for slaughter 
 Like a living wave over fence and brush
 We swept and swung with a flying rush
 Till we came to the dreaded water

 Ha ha I laugh at it now to think
 Of the way I contrived to work it
 Shut in amongst them before youd wink
 He found himself on the waters brink
 With never a chance to shirk it

 The thought of the horror he felt beguiles
 The heart of this grizzled rover
 He gave a snort you could hear for miles
 And a spring would have cleared the Channel Isles
 And carried me safely over

 Then we neared the scrub and I pulled him back
 In the shade where the gumleaves quiver
 And I waited there in the shadows black
 While the rest of the horses round the track
 Went on like a rushing river

 At the second round as the field swept by
 I saw that the pace was telling
 But on they thundered and byandbye
 As they passed the stand I could hear the cry
 Of the folk in the distance yelling

 Then the last time round And the hoofbeats rang
 And I said Well its now or never
 And out on the heels of the throng I sprang
 And the spurs bit deep and the whipcord sang
 As I rode For the Mooki River

 We raced for home in a cloud of dust
 And the curses rose in chorus
 Twas flog and hustle and jump you must
 And The Cow ran well  but to my disgust
 There was one got home before us

 Twas a big black horse that I had not seen
 In the part of the race Id ridden
 And his coat was cool and his rider clean
 And I thought that perhaps I had not been
 The only one that had hidden

     

 And the trainer came with a visage blue
 With rage when the race concluded
 Said he I thought youd have pulled us through
 But the man on the black horse planted too
 AND NEARER TO HOME THAN YOU DID

 Alas to think that those times so gay
 Have vanished and passed for ever
 You dont believe in the yarn you say
 Why man Twas a matter of every day
 When we raced on the Mooki River




In the Stable



 What You dont like him well maybe  we all have our fancies of course
 Brumby to look at you reckon Well no hes a thoroughbred horse
 Sired by a son of old Panic  look at his ears and his head 
 Lopeared and Romannosed aint he  well thats how the Panics are bred
 Gluttonous ugly and lazy rough as a tipcart to ride
 Yet if you offered a sovereign apiece for the hairs on his hide
 That wouldnt buy him nor twice that while Ive a pound to the good
 This here old stager stays by me and lives like a thoroughbred should
 Hunt him away from his bedding and sit yourself down by the wall
 Till you hear how the old fellow saved me from Gilbert OMaley and Hall

     

 Gilbert and Hall and OMaley back in the bushranging days
 Made themselves kings of the district  ruled it in oldfashioned ways 
 Robbing the coach and the escort stealing our horses at night
 Calling sometimes at the homesteads and giving the women a fright
 Came to the station one morning  and why they did this no one knows 
 Took a brood mare from the paddock  wanting some fun I suppose 
 Fastened a bucket beneath her hung by a strap round her flank
 Then turned her loose in the timber back of the sevenmile tank

 Go She went mad She went tearing
 and screaming with fear through the trees
 While the curst bucket beneath her was banging her flanks and her knees
 Bucking and racing and screaming she ran to the back of the run
 Killed herself there in a gully by God but they paid for their fun
 Paid for it dear for the blackboys found tracks and the bucket and all
 And I swore that Id live to get even with Gilbert OMaley and Hall

 Day after day then I chased them  course they had friends on the sly
 Friends who were willing to sell them to those who were willing to buy
 Early one morning we found them in camp at the Cockatoo Farm
 One of us shot at OMaley and wounded him under the arm
 Ran them for miles in the ranges till Hall with his horse fairly beat
 Took to the rocks and we lost him  the others made good their retreat
 It was war to the knife then I tell you and once on the door of my shed
 They nailed up a notice that offered a hundred reward for my head

 Then we heard they were gone from the district
 they stuck up a coach in the West
 And I rode by myself in the paddocks taking a bit of a rest
 Riding this colt as a youngster  awkward halfbroken and shy
 He wheeled round one day on a sudden I looked but I couldnt see why
 But I soon found out why for before me the hillside rose up like a wall
 And there on the top with their rifles were Gilbert OMaley and Hall

 Twas a good threemile run to the homestead 
 bad going with plenty of trees 
 So I gathered the youngster together and gripped at his ribs with my knees
 Twas a mighty poor chance to escape them It puts a mans nerve to the test
 On a halfbroken colt to be hunted by the best mounted men in the West
 But the halfbroken colt was a racehorse He lay down to work with a will
 Flashed through the scrub like a cleanskin 
 by Heavens we FLEW down the hill
 Over a twentyfoot gully he swept with the spring of a deer
 And they fired as we jumped but they missed me 
 a bullet sang close to my ear 
 And the jump gained us ground for they shirked it
 but I saw as we raced through the gap
 That the rails at the homestead were fastened 
 I was caught like a rat in a trap
 Fenced with barbed wire was the paddock 
 barbed wire that would cut like a knife 
 How was a youngster to clear it that never had jumped in his life

 Bang went a rifle behind me  the colt gave a spring he was hit
 Straight at the sliprails I rode him  I felt him take hold of the bit
 Never a foot to the right or the left did he swerve in his stride
 Awkward and frightened but honest the sort its a pleasure to ride
 Straight at the rails where theyd fastened
 barbed wire on the top of the post
 Rose like a stag and went over with hardly a scratch at the most
 Into the homestead I darted and snatched down my gun from the wall
 And I tell you I made them step lively Gilbert OMaley and Hall

 Yes Theres the mark of the bullet  hes got it inside of him yet
 Mixed up somehow with his victuals but bless you he dont seem to fret
 Gluttonous ugly and lazy  eats any thing he can bite
 Now let us shut up the stable and bid the old fellow goodnight
 Ah We cant breed em the sort that were bred when we old uns were young
 Yes I was saying these bushrangers none of em lived to be hung
 Gilbert was shot by the troopers Hall was betrayed by his friend
 Campbell disposed of OMaley bringing the lot to an end
 But you can talk about riding  Ive ridden a lot in the past 
 Wait till theres rifles behind you youll know what it means to go fast
 Ive steeplechased raced and run horses
 but I think the most dashing of all
 Was the ride when the old fellow saved me from Gilbert OMaley and Hall




He Giveth His Beloved Sleep



 The long day passes with its load of sorrow
 In slumber deep
 I lay me down to rest until tomorrow 
 Thank God for sleep

 Thank God for all respite from weary toiling
 From cares that creep
 Across our lives like evil shadows spoiling
 Gods kindly sleep

 We plough and sow and as the hours grow later
 We strive to reap
 And build our barns and hope to build them greater
 Before we sleep

 We toil and strain and strive with one another
 In hopes to heap
 Some greater share of profit than our brother
 Before we sleep

 What will it profit that with tears or laughter
 Our watch we keep
 Beyond it all there lies the Great Hereafter
 Thank God for sleep

 For at the last beseeching Christ to save us
 We turn with deep
 Heartfelt thanksgiving unto God who gave us
 The Gift of Sleep




Driver Smith



 Twas Driver Smith of Battery A was anxious to see a fight
 He thought of the Transvaal all the day he thought of it all the night 
 Well if the batterys left behind Ill go to the war says he
 Ill go adriving an ambulance in the ranks of the AMC

 Im fairly sick of these here parades its want of a change that kills
 Acharging the Randwick Rifle Range and aiming at Surry Hills
 And I think if I go with the ambulance Im certain to find a show
 For they have to send the Medical men wherever the troops can go

 Wherever the rifle bullets flash and the Maxims raise a din
 Its there youll find the Medical men araking the wounded in 
 Araking em in like human flies  and a driver smart like me
 Will find some scope for his extra skill in the ranks of the AMC

 So Driver Smith he went to the war acracking his drivers whip
 From ambulance to collecting base they showed him his regular trip
 And he said to the boys that were marching past as he gave his whip a crack
 Youll walk yourselves to the fight says he 
 Lord spare me Ill drive you back

 Now the fight went on in the Transvaal hills for the half of a day or more
 And Driver Smith he worked his trip  all aboard for the seat of war
 He took his load from the stretcher men and hurried em homeward fast
 Till he heard a sound that he knew full well  a battery rolling past

 He heard the clink of the leading chains and the roll of the guns behind 
 He heard the crack of the drivers whips
 and he says to em Strike me blind
 Ill miss me trip with this ambulance although I dont care to shirk
 But Ill take the car off the line today and follow the guns at work

 Then up the Battery Colonel came acursing em black in the face
 Sit down and shift em you drivers there and gallop em into place
 So off the Battery rolled and swung agoing a merry dance
 And holding his own with the leading gun goes Smith with his ambulance

 They opened fire on the mountain side apeppering by and large
 When over the hill above their flank the Boers came down at the charge
 They rushed the guns with a daring rush avolleying left and right
 And Driver Smith with his ambulance moved up to the edge of the fight

 The gunners stuck to their guns like men and fought like the wild cats fight
 For a Battery man dont leave his gun with ever a hope in sight
 But the bullets sang and the Mausers cracked and the Battery men gave way
 Till Driver Smith with his ambulance drove into the thick of the fray

 He saw the head of the Transvaal troop athundering to and fro
 A hard old face with a monkey beard  a face that he seemed to know
 Now whos that leader said Driver Smith Ive seen him before today
 Why bless my heart but its Krugers self
 and he jumped for him straight away

 He collared old Kruger round the waist and hustled him into the van
 It wasnt according to stretcher drill for raising a wounded man
 But he forced him in and said All aboard were off for a little ride
 And youll have the car to yourself says he I reckon were full inside

 He wheeled his team on the mountain side and set em a merry pace
 Agalloping over the rocks and stones and a lot of the Boers gave chase
 But Driver Smith had a fairish start and he said to the Boers Goodday
 You have Buckleys chance for to catch a man that was trained in Battery A

 He drove his team to the hospital and said to the PMO
 Beg pardon sir but I missed a trip mistaking the way to go
 And Kruger came to the ambulance and asked could we spare a bed
 So I fetched him here and well take him home to show for a bob a head

 So the word went round to the English troops to say they need fight no more
 For Driver Smith with his ambulance had ended the blooming war
 And in London now at the music halls hes starring it every night
 And drawing a hundred pounds a week to tell how he won the fight




Theres Another Blessed Horse Fell Down



 When youre lying in your hammock sleeping soft and sleeping sound
 Without a care or trouble on your mind
 And theres nothing to disturb you but the engines going round
 And youre dreaming of the girl you left behind
 In the middle of your joys youll be wakened by a noise
 And a clatter on the deck above your crown
 And youll hear the corporal shout as he turns the picket out
 Theres another blessed horse fell down

 You can see em in the morning when youre cleaning out the stall
 Aleaning on the railings nearly dead
 And you reckon by the evening theyll be pretty sure to fall
 And you curse them as you tumble into bed
 Oh youll hear it pretty soon Pass the word for Denny Moon
 Theres a horse here throwing handsprings like a clown
 And its Shove the others back or hell cripple half the pack
 Theres another blessed horse fell down

 And when the war is over and the fighting all is done
 And youre all at home with medals on your chest
 And youve learnt to sleep so soundly that the firing of a gun
 At your bedside wouldnt rob you of your rest
 As you lie in slumber deep if your wife walks in her sleep
 And tumbles down the stairs and breaks her crown
 Oh it wont awaken you for youll say Its nothing new
 Its another blessed horse fell down




On the Trek



 Oh the weary weary journey on the trek day after day
 With sun above and silent veldt below
 And our hearts keep turning homeward to the youngsters far away
 And the homestead where the climbing roses grow
 Shall we see the flats grow golden with the ripening of the grain
 Shall we hear the parrots calling on the bough
 Ah the weary months of marching ere we hear them call again
 For were going on a long job now

 In the drowsy days on escort riding slowly half asleep
 With the endless line of waggons stretching back
 While the khaki soldiers travel like a mob of travelling sheep
 Plodding silent on the neverending track
 While the constant snap and sniping of the foe you never see
 Makes you wonder will your turn come  when and how
 As the Mauser ball hums past you like a vicious kind of bee 
 Oh were going on a long job now

 When the dash and the excitement and the novelty are dead
 And youve seen a load of wounded once or twice
 Or youve watched your old mate dying  with the vultures overhead
 Well you wonder if the war is worth the price
 And down along Monaro now theyre starting out to shear
 I can picture the excitement and the row
 But theyll miss me on the Lachlan when they call the roll this year
 For were going on a long job now




The Last Parade



 With never a sound of trumpet
 With never a flag displayed
 The last of the old campaigners
 Lined up for the last parade

 Weary they were and battered
 Shoeless and knocked about
 From under their ragged forelocks
 Their hungry eyes looked out

 And they watched as the old commander
 Read out to the cheering men
 The Nations thanks and the orders
 To carry them home again

 And the last of the old campaigners
 Sinewy lean and spare 
 He spoke for his hungry comrades
 Have we not done our share

 Starving and tired and thirsty
 We limped on the blazing plain
 And after a long nights picket
 You saddled us up again

 We froze on the windswept kopjes
 When the frost lay snowywhite
 Never a halt in the daytime
 Never a rest at night

 We knew when the rifles rattled
 From the hillside bare and brown
 And over our weary shoulders
 We felt warm blood run down

 As we turned for the stretching gallop
 Crushed to the earth with weight
 But we carried our riders through it 
 Carried them praps too late

 Steel We were steel to stand it 
 We that have lasted through
 We that are old campaigners
 Pitiful poor and few

 Over the sea you brought us
 Over the leagues of foam
 Now we have served you fairly
 Will you not take us home

 Home to the Hunter River
 To the flats where the lucerne grows
 Home where the Murrumbidgee
 Runs white with the melted snows

 This is a small thing surely
 Will not you give command
 That the last of the old campaigners
 Go back to their native land

     

 They looked at the grim commander
 But never a sign he made
 Dismiss and the old campaigners
 Moved off from their last parade




With French to Kimberley



 The Boers were down on Kimberley with siege and Maxim gun
 The Boers were down on Kimberley their numbers ten to one
 Faint were the hopes the British had to make the struggle good
 Defenceless in an open plain the Diamond City stood
 They built them forts from bags of sand they fought from roof and wall
 They flashed a message to the south Help or the town must fall
 And down our ranks the order ran to march at dawn of day
 For French was off to Kimberley to drive the Boers away

 He made no march along the line he made no front attack
 Upon those Magersfontein heights that drove the Scotchmen back
 But eastward over pathless plains by open veldt and vley
 Across the front of Cronjes force his troopers held their way
 The springbuck feeding on the flats where Modder River runs
 Were startled by his horses hoofs the rumble of his guns
 The Dutchmans spies that watched his march from every rocky wall
 Rode back in haste He marches east He threatens Jacobsdal
 Then north he wheeled as wheels the hawk and showed to their dismay
 That French was off to Kimberley to drive the Boers away

 His column was five thousand strong  all mounted men  and guns
 There met beneath the worldwide flag the worldwide Empires sons
 They came to prove to all the earth that kinship conquers space
 And those who fight the British Isles must fight the British race
 From far New Zealands flax and fern from cold Canadian snows
 From Queensland plains where hot as fire the summer sunshine glows
 And in the front the Lancers rode that New South Wales had sent
 With easy stride across the plain their long lean Walers went
 Unknown untried those squadrons were but proudly out they drew
 Beside the English regiments that fought at Waterloo
 From every coast from every clime they met in proud array
 To go with French to Kimberley to drive the Boers away

 He crossed the Reit and fought his way towards the Modder bank
 The foemen closed behind his march and hung upon the flank
 The long dry grass was all ablaze and fierce the veldt fire runs
 He fought them through a wall of flame that blazed around the guns
 Then limbered up and drove at speed though horses fell and died
 We might not halt for man nor beast on that wild daring ride
 Black with the smoke and parched with thirst we pressed the livelong day
 Our headlong march to Kimberley to drive the Boers away

 We reached the drift at fall of night and camped across the ford
 Next day from all the hills around the Dutchmans cannons roared
 A narrow pass between the hills with guns on either side
 The boldest man might well turn pale before that pass he tried
 For if the first attack should fail then every hope was gone
 But French looked once and only once and then he said Push on
 The gunners plied their guns amain the hail of shrapnel flew
 With rifle fire and lancer charge their squadrons back we threw
 And through the pass between the hills we swept in furious fray
 And French was through to Kimberley to drive the Boers away

 Ay French was through to Kimberley And ere the day was done
 We saw the Diamond City stand lit by the evening sun
 Above the town the heliograph hung like an eye of flame
 Around the town the foemen camped  they knew not that we came
 But soon they saw us rank on rank they heard our squadrons tread
 In panic fear they left their tents in hopeless rout they fled
 And French rode into Kimberley the people cheered amain
 The women came with tearstained eyes to touch his bridle rein
 The starving children lined the streets to raise a feeble cheer
 The bells rang out a joyous peal to say Relief is here
 Ay we that saw that stirring march are proud that we can say
 We went with French to Kimberley to drive the Boers away




Johnny Boer



 Men fight all shapes and sizes as the racing horses run
 And no man knows his courage till he stands before a gun
 At mixedup fighting hand to hand and clawing men about
 They reckon Fuzzywuzzy is the hottest fighter out
 But Fuzzy gives himself away  his style is out of date
 He charges like a driven grouse that rushes on its fate
 Youve nothing in the world to do but pump him full of lead
 But when youre fighting Johnny Boer you have to use your head
 He dont believe in front attacks or charging at the run
 He fights you from a kopje with his little Maxim gun

 For when the Lord He made the earth it seems uncommon clear
 He gave the job of Africa to some good engineer
 Who started building fortresses on fashions of his own 
 Lunettes redoubts and counterscarps all made of rock and stone
 The Boer needs only bring a gun for ready to his hand
 He finds these heavenbuilt fortresses all scattered through the land
 And there he sits and winks his eye and wheels his gun about
 And we must charge across the plain to hunt the beggar out
 It aint a game that grows on us theres lots of better fun
 Than charging at old Johnny with his little Maxim gun

 On rocks a goat could scarcely climb steep as the walls of Troy
 He wheels a fourpointseven about as easy as a toy
 With bullocks yoked and dragropes manned he lifts her up the rocks
 And shifts her every now and then as cunning as a fox
 At night you mark her right ahead you see her clean and clear
 Next day at dawn  What ho she bumps  from somewhere in the rear
 Or else the keenesteyed patrol will miss him with the glass 
 Hes lying hidden in the rocks to let the leaders pass
 But when the main guard comes along he opens up the fun
 Theres lots of ammunition for the little Maxim gun

 But after all the job is sure although the job is slow
 We have to see the business through the Boer has got to go
 With Nordenfeldt and lyddite shell its certain soon or late
 Well hunt him from his kopjes and across the Orange State
 And then across those open flats youll see the beggar run
 And well be running after with OUR little Maxim gun




What Have the Cavalry Done



 What have the cavalry done
 Cantered and trotted about
 Routin the enemy out
 Causin the beggars to run
 And we tramped along in the blazin heat
 Over the veldt on our weary feet
 Tramp tramp tramp
 Under the blazin sun
 With never the sight of a bloomin Boer
 Cause theyd hunted em long before 
 Thats what the cavalry done

 What have the gunners done
 Battlin every day
 Battlin any way
 Boers outranged em but what cared they
 Shoot and be damned said the RHA
 See when the fight grows hot
 Under the rifles or not
 Always the order runs
 Fetch up the bloomin guns

 And youd see them great gunhorses spring
 To the action front  and around theyd swing
 Find the range with some queer machine
 At four thousand with fuse fourteen
 Ready Fire number one
 Handled the battery neat and quick
 Stick to it too How DID they stick
 Never a gunner was seen to run
 Never a gunner would leave his gun
 Not though his mates dropped all around
 Always a gunner would stand his ground
 Take the army  the infantry
 Mounted rifles and cavalry
 Twice the numbers Id give away
 And Id fight the lot with the RHA
 For they showed us how a corps SHOULD be run
 Thats what the gunners done




Right in the Front of the Army



 Where ave you been this week or more
 Avent seen you about the war
 Thought perhaps you was at the rear
 Guarding the waggons What us No fear
 Where have we been Why bless my heart
 Where have we been since the bloomin start
 Right in the front of the army
 Battling day and night
 Right in the front of the army
 Teaching em how to fight
 Every separate man you see
 Sapper gunner and CIV
 Every one of em seems to be
 Right in the front of the army

 Most of the troops to the camp had gone
 When we met with a cowgun toiling on
 And we said to the boys as they walked her past
 Well thank goodness youre here at last
 Here at last Why what dyer mean
 Aint we just where weve always been
 Right in the front of the army
 Battling day and night
 Right in the front of the army
 Teaching em how to fight
 Correspondents and vets in force
 Mounted foot and dismounted horse
 All of them were as a matter of course
 Right in the front of the army

 Old Lord Roberts will have to mind
 If ever the enemy get behind
 For theyll smash him up with a rear attack
 Because his army has got no back
 Think of the horrors that might befall
 An army without any rear at all
 Right in the front of the army
 Battling day and night
 Right in the front of the army
 Teaching em how to fight
 Swede attaches and German counts
 Yeomen known as De Wets remounts
 All of them were by their own accounts
 Right in the front of the army




That VC



 Twas in the days of front attack
 This glorious truth wed yet to learn it 
 That every front had got a back
 And French was just the man to turn it

 A wounded soldier on the ground
 Was lying hid behind a hummock
 He proved the good old proverb sound 
 An army travels on its stomach

 He lay as flat as any fish
 His nose had worn a little furrow
 He only had one frantic wish
 That like an antbear he could burrow

 The bullets whistled into space
 The pompom gun kept up its braying
 The fourpointseven supplied the bass 
 Youd think the devils band was playing

 A valiant comrade crawling near
 Observed his most supine behaviour
 And crept towards him Hey what cheer
 Buck up said he Ive come to save yer

 You get up on my shoulders mate
 And if we live beyond the firing
 Ill get the VC sure as fate
 Because our blokes is all retiring

 Its fifty pounds a year says he
 Ill stand you lots of beer and whisky
 No says the wounded man not me
 Ill not be saved its far too risky

 Im fairly safe behind this mound
 Ive worn a hole that seems to fit me
 But if you lift me off the ground
 Its fifty pounds to one theyll hit me

 So back towards the firing line
 Our friend crept slowly to the rear oh
 Remarking What a selfish swine
 He might have let me be a hero




Fed Up



 I aint a timid man at all Im just as brave as most
 Ill take my chance in open fight and die beside my post
 But riding round the ole day long as target for a Krupp
 Adrawing fire from Koppies  well Im fair fed up

 Its wonderful how few get hit its luck that pulls us through
 Their rifle fires no class at all it misses me and you
 But when they sprinkle shells around like water from a cup
 From that there blooming pompom gun  well Im fed up

 We never get a chance to charge to do a thrust and cut
 Ill have to chuck the Cavalry and join the Mounted Fut
 But after all  Whats Mounted Fut I saw them tother day
 They occupied a Koppie when the Boers had run away
 The Cavalry went riding on and seen a score of fights
 But there they kept them Mounted Fut three solid days and nights 
 Three solid starving days and nights with scarce a bite or sup
 Well after that on Mounted Fut Im fair fed up

 And tramping with the Footies aint as easy as it looks
 They scarcely ever see a Boer except in picture books
 They do a march of twenty mile that leaves em nearly dead
 And then they find the bloomin Boers is twenty miles ahead
 Each Footy is as full of fight as any bulldog pup
 But walking forty miles to fight  well Im fed up

 So after all I think that when I leave the Cavalry
 Ill either join the ambulance or else the ASC
 Theyve always tucker in the plate and coffee in the cup
 But Bully Beef and Biscuits  well Im fair fed up




Jock



 Theres a soldier thats been doing of his share
 In the fighting up and down and round about
 Hes continually marching here and there
 And hes fighting morning in and morning out

 The Boer you see he generally runs
 But sometimes when he hides behind a rock
 And we cant make no impression with the guns
 Oh then youll hear the order Send for Jock

 Yes its Jock  Scotch Jock
 Hes the fellow that can give or take a knock
 For hes hairy and hes hard
 And his feet are by the yard
 And his face is like the face whats on a clock
 But when the bullets fly you will mostly hear the cry 
 Send for Jock

 The Cavalry have gun and sword and lance
 Before they choose their weapon why theyre dead
 The Mounted Fut are hampered in advance
 By holding of their helmets on their head

 And when the Boer has dug himself a trench
 And placed his Maxim gun behind a rock
 These mounted heroes  pets of Johnny French 
 They have to sit and wait and send for Jock

 Yes the Jocks  Scotch Jocks
 With their music thatd terrify an ox
 When the bullets kick the sand
 You can hear the sharp command 
 FortySecond At the double Charge the rocks
 And the charge is like a flood
 When theyve warmed the Highland blood
 Of the Jocks




Santa Claus



 Halt Who goes there The sentrys call
 Rose on the midnight air
 Above the noises of the camp
 The roll of wheels the horses tramp
 The challenge echoed over all 
 Halt Who goes there

 A quaint old figure clothed in white
 He bore a staff of pine
 An ivywreath was on his head
 Advance oh friend the sentry said
 Advance for this is Christmas night
 And give the countersign

 No sign nor countersign have I
 Through many lands I roam
 The whole world over far and wide
 To exiles all at Christmastide
 From those who love them tenderly
 I bring a thought of home

 From English brook and Scottish burn
 From cold Canadian snows
 From those far lands ye hold most dear
 I bring you all a greeting here
 A frond of a New Zealand fern
 A bloom of English rose

 From faithful wife and loving lass
 I bring a wish divine
 For Christmas blessings on your head
 I wish you well the sentry said
 But here alas you may not pass
 Without the countersign

 He vanished  and the sentrys tramp
 Reechoed down the line
 It was not till the morning light
 The soldiers knew that in the night
 Old Santa Claus had come to camp
 Without the countersign




From a section of Advertisements 1909




THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER
AND OTHER VERSES

 By A B Paterson

 The immediate success of this book of bush ballads is without parallel
in Colonial literary annals nor can any living English or American poet
boast so wide a public always excepting Mr Rudyard Kipling

 These lines have the true lyrical cry in them
Eloquent and ardent verses

 Swinging rattling ballads of ready humour ready pathos
and crowding adventure    Stirring and entertaining ballads
about great rides in which the lines gallop like the very hoofs
of the horses

 At his best he compares not unfavourably with the author
of BarrackRoom Ballads

 Mr A Patchett Martin London In my opinion
it is the absolutely unEnglish thoroughly Australian style and character
of these new bush bards which has given them such immediate popularity
such wide vogue among all classes of the rising native generation

 Australia has produced in Mr A B Paterson a national poet
whose bush ballads are as distinctively characteristic of the country
as Burnss poetry is characteristic of Scotland

 A book like this    is worth a dozen of the aspiring
idealistic sort since it has a deal of rough laughter
and a dash of real tears in its composition

 These ballads    are full of such go that the mere reading of them
make the blood tingle    But there are other things
in Mr Patersons book besides mere racing and chasing
and each piece bears the mark of special local knowledge feeling and colour
The poet has also a note of pathos which is always wholesome

 He gallops along with a by no means doubtful music
shouting his vigorous songs as he rides in pursuit of wild bush horses
constraining us to listen and applaud by dint of his manly tones
and capital subjects    We turn to Mr Patersons roaring muse
with instantaneous gratitude




RIO GRANDES LAST RACE AND OTHER VERSES

 By A B Paterson

 There is no mistaking the vigour of Mr Patersons verse
there is no difficulty in feeling the strong human interest
which moves in it

 Every way worthy of the man who ranks with the first of Australian poets

 At once naturalistic and imaginative and racy without being slangy
the poems have always a strong human interest of everyday life
to keep them going They make a book which should give an equal pleasure
to simple and to fastidious readers

 Now and again a deeper theme like an echo from the older
more experienced land leads him to more serious singing and proves that
real poetry is after all universal It is a hearty book

 Mr Paterson has powerful and varied sympathies
coupled with a genuine lyrical impulse and some skill
which makes his attempts always attractive and usually successful

 These are all entertaining their rough and ready wit
and virility of expression making them highly acceptable
while the dash of satire gives point to the humour

 He catches the bush in its most joyous moments and writes of it
with the simple charm of an unaffected lover

 Will be welcome to that too select class at home who follow
the Australian endeavour to utter a fresh and genuine poetic voice

 Mr Paterson now proves beyond question that Australia has produced
at least one singer who can voice in truest poetry the aspirations
and experiences peculiar to the Commonwealth and who is to be ranked
with the foremost living poets of the motherland

 Fine swinging stirring stuff that sings as it goes along
The subjects are capital and some of the refrains haunt one
There is always room for a book of unpretentious vigorous verse
of this sort

 These ballads make bright and easy reading one takes up the book
and delighted at the rhythm turns page after page
finding entertainment upon each




Biographical Note

Andrew Barton Paterson was born at Narambla in New South Wales on 17
February 1864 but grew up at Buckenbah and Illalong He became a lawyer
but devoted much of his time to writing and gained popularity
especially for his poetry and ballads His best known poems are The Man
from Snowy River 1892 on which a motion picture was loosely based and
Waltzing Matilda 1895 which slowly became an Australian symbol and
national song The poems he wrote for a Sydney newspaper led him into
reporting and he went to South Africa to cover the Boer War Always a
fair man he had his doubts about the war and was a little too vocal
about it for the tastes of some of his readers During the First World
War he served in Egypt as a Major in a Remount Unit training horses for
the war This fit one of his main interests in life  horses a
preoccupation which is very evident in his poems and even in his choice
of pseudonym The Banjo was a racehorse

The works for which Paterson is famous were mostly written before the
First World War and are collected in three books of poems The Man from
Snowy River and Other Verses 1895 Rio Grandes Last Race and Other
Verses 1902 and Saltbush Bill JP and Other Verses 1917 His
prose works include An Outback Marriage 1906 and Three Elephant Power
and Other Stories 1917 the latter of which is a collection of tall
tales and serious but often humourous reporting In fact above all
else it is perhaps Patersons sense of humour that sets him apart from
such balladists as Rudyard Kipling and Robert Service It should also be
noted that Paterson was writing his ballads before either of these
became wellknown and there was little if any influence from either
side More likely Paterson was influenced by the Scottish tradition of
poetry Paterson was of Scottish descent which had been popularized in
Australia by Adam Lindsay Gordon and others Banjo Paterson died of a
heart attack on 5 February 1941
