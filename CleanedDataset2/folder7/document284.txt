 BOOK ONE


Chapter 1

Selden paused in surprise In the afternoon rush of the Grand Central
Station his eyes had been refreshed by the sight of Miss Lily Bart

It was a Monday in early September and he was returning to his work from
a hurried dip into the country but what was Miss Bart doing in town at
that season If she had appeared to be catching a train he might have
inferred that he had come on her in the act of transition between one and
another of the countryhouses which disputed her presence after the close
of the Newport season but her desultory air perplexed him She stood
apart from the crowd letting it drift by her to the platform or the
street and wearing an air of irresolution which might as he surmised
be the mask of a very definite purpose It struck him at once that she
was waiting for some one but he hardly knew why the idea arrested him
There was nothing new about Lily Bart yet he could never see her without
a faint movement of interest it was characteristic of her that she
always roused speculation that her simplest acts seemed the result of
farreaching intentions

An impulse of curiosity made him turn out of his direct line to the door
and stroll past her He knew that if she did not wish to be seen she
would contrive to elude him and it amused him to think of putting her
skill to the test

Mr Seldenwhat good luck

She came forward smiling eager almost in her resolve to intercept him
One or two persons in brushing past them lingered to look for Miss
Bart was a figure to arrest even the suburban traveller rushing to his
last train

Selden had never seen her more radiant Her vivid head relieved against
the dull tints of the crowd made her more conspicuous than in a
ballroom and under her dark hat and veil she regained the girlish
smoothness the purity of tint that she was beginning to lose after
eleven years of late hours and indefatigable dancing Was it really
eleven years Selden found himself wondering and had she indeed reached
the nineandtwentieth birthday with which her rivals credited her

What luck she repeated How nice of you to come to my rescue

He responded joyfully that to do so was his mission in life and asked
what form the rescue was to take

Oh almost anyeven to sitting on a bench and talking to me One sits
out a cotillionwhy not sit out a train It isnt a bit hotter here than
in Mrs Van Osburghs conservatoryand some of the women are not a bit
uglier She broke off laughing to explain that she had come up to
town from Tuxedo on her way to the Gus Trenors at Bellomont and had
missed the threefifteen train to Rhinebeck And there isnt another
till halfpast five She consulted the little jewelled watch among her
laces Just two hours to wait And I dont know what to do with myself
My maid came up this morning to do some shopping for me and was to go on
to Bellomont at one oclock and my aunts house is closed and I dont
know a soul in town She glanced plaintively about the station It IS
hotter than Mrs Van Osburghs after all If you can spare the time do
take me somewhere for a breath of air

He declared himself entirely at her disposal the adventure struck him as
diverting As a spectator he had always enjoyed Lily Bart and his
course lay so far out of her orbit that it amused him to be drawn for a
moment into the sudden intimacy which her proposal implied

Shall we go over to Sherrys for a cup of tea

She smiled assentingly and then made a slight grimace

So many people come up to town on a Mondayone is sure to meet a lot of
bores Im as old as the hills of course and it ought not to make any
difference but if IM old enough youre not she objected gaily Im
dying for teabut isnt there a quieter place

He answered her smile which rested on him vividly Her discretions
interested him almost as much as her imprudences he was so sure that
both were part of the same carefullyelaborated plan In judging Miss
Bart he had always made use of the argument from design

The resources of New York are rather meagre he said but Ill find a
hansom first and then well invent something He led her through the
throng of returning holidaymakers past sallowfaced girls in
preposterous hats and flatchested women struggling with paper bundles
and palmleaf fans Was it possible that she belonged to the same race
The dinginess the crudity of this average section of womanhood made him
feel how highly specialized she was

A rapid shower had cooled the air and clouds still hung refreshingly
over the moist street

How delicious Let us walk a little she said as they emerged from the
station

They turned into Madison Avenue and began to stroll northward As she
moved beside him with her long light step Selden was conscious of
taking a luxurious pleasure in her nearness in the modelling of her
little ear the crisp upward wave of her hairwas it ever so slightly
brightened by artand the thick planting of her straight black lashes
Everything about her was at once vigorous and exquisite at once strong
and fine He had a confused sense that she must have cost a great deal to
make that a great many dull and ugly people must in some mysterious
way have been sacrificed to produce her He was aware that the qualities
distinguishing her from the herd of her sex were chiefly external as
though a fine glaze of beauty and fastidiousness had been applied to
vulgar clay Yet the analogy left him unsatisfied for a coarse texture
will not take a high finish and was it not possible that the material
was fine but that circumstance had fashioned it into a futile shape

As he reached this point in his speculations the sun came out and her
lifted parasol cut off his enjoyment A moment or two later she paused
with a sigh

Oh dear Im so hot and thirstyand what a hideous place New York is
She looked despairingly up and down the dreary thoroughfare Other
cities put on their best clothes in summer but New York seems to sit in
its shirtsleeves Her eyes wandered down one of the sidestreets
Someone has had the humanity to plant a few trees over there Let us go
into the shade

I am glad my street meets with your approval said Selden as they
turned the corner

Your street Do you live here

She glanced with interest along the new brick and limestone housefronts
fantastically varied in obedience to the American craving for novelty
but fresh and inviting with their awnings and flowerboxes

Ah yesto be sure THE BENEDICK What a nicelooking building I
dont think Ive ever seen it before She looked across at the
flathouse with its marble porch and pseudoGeorgian facade Which are
your windows Those with the awnings down

On the top flooryes

And that nice little balcony is yours How cool it looks up there

He paused a moment Come up and see he suggested I can give you a
cup of tea in no timeand you wont meet any bores

Her colour deepenedshe still had the art of blushing at the right
timebut she took the suggestion as lightly as it was made

Why not Its too temptingIll take the risk she declared

Oh Im not dangerous he said in the same key In truth he had never
liked her as well as at that moment He knew she had accepted without
afterthought he could never be a factor in her calculations and there
was a surprise a refreshment almost in the spontaneity of her consent

On the threshold he paused a moment feeling for his latchkey

Theres no one here but I have a servant who is supposed to come in the
mornings and its just possible he may have put out the teathings and
provided some cake

He ushered her into a slip of a hall hung with old prints She noticed
the letters and notes heaped on the table among his gloves and sticks
then she found herself in a small library dark but cheerful with its
walls of books a pleasantly faded Turkey rug a littered desk and as he
had foretold a teatray on a low table near the window A breeze had
sprung up swaying inward the muslin curtains and bringing a fresh scent
of mignonette and petunias from the flowerbox on the balcony

Lily sank with a sigh into one of the shabby leather chairs

How delicious to have a place like this all to ones self What a
miserable thing it is to be a woman She leaned back in a luxury of
discontent

Selden was rummaging in a cupboard for the cake

Even women he said have been known to enjoy the privileges of a
flat

Oh governessesor widows But not girlsnot poor miserable
marriageable girls

I even know a girl who lives in a flat

She sat up in surprise You do

I do he assured her emerging from the cupboard with the soughtfor
cake

Oh I knowyou mean Gerty Farish She smiled a little unkindly But I
said MARRIAGEABLEand besides she has a horrid little place and no
maid and such queer things to eat Her cook does the washing and the
food tastes of soap I should hate that you know

You shouldnt dine with her on washdays said Selden cutting the cake

They both laughed and he knelt by the table to light the lamp under the
kettle while she measured out the tea into a little teapot of green
glaze As he watched her hand polished as a bit of old ivory with its
slender pink nails and the sapphire bracelet slipping over her wrist he
was struck with the irony of suggesting to her such a life as his cousin
Gertrude Farish had chosen She was so evidently the victim of the
civilization which had produced her that the links of her bracelet
seemed like manacles chaining her to her fate

She seemed to read his thought It was horrid of me to say that of
Gerty she said with charming compunction I forgot she was your
cousin But were so different you know she likes being good and I
like being happy And besides she is free and I am not If I were I
daresay I could manage to be happy even in her flat It must be pure
bliss to arrange the furniture just as one likes and give all the
horrors to the ashman If I could only do over my aunts drawingroom I
know I should be a better woman

Is it so very bad he asked sympathetically

She smiled at him across the teapot which she was holding up to be
filled

That shows how seldom you come there Why dont you come oftener

When I do come its not to look at Mrs Penistons furniture

Nonsense she said You dont come at alland yet we get on so well
when we meet

Perhaps thats the reason he answered promptly Im afraid I havent
any cream you knowshall you mind a slice of lemon instead

I shall like it better She waited while he cut the lemon and dropped a
thin disk into her cup But that is not the reason she insisted

The reason for what

For your never coming She leaned forward with a shade of perplexity in
her charming eyes I wish I knewI wish I could make you out Of course
I know there are men who dont like meone can tell that at a glance
And there are others who are afraid of me they think I want to marry
them She smiled up at him frankly But I dont think you dislike
meand you cant possibly think I want to marry you

NoI absolve you of that he agreed

Well then

He had carried his cup to the fireplace and stood leaning against the
chimneypiece and looking down on her with an air of indolent amusement
The provocation in her eyes increased his amusementhe had not supposed
she would waste her powder on such small game but perhaps she was only
keeping her hand in or perhaps a girl of her type had no conversation
but of the personal kind At any rate she was amazingly pretty and he
had asked her to tea and must live up to his obligations

Well then he said with a plunge perhaps THATS the reason

What

The fact that you dont want to marry me Perhaps I dont regard it as
such a strong inducement to go and see you He felt a slight shiver down
his spine as he ventured this but her laugh reassured him

Dear Mr Selden that wasnt worthy of you Its stupid of you to make
love to me and it isnt like you to be stupid She leaned back sipping
her tea with an air so enchantingly judicial that if they had been in
her aunts drawingroom he might almost have tried to disprove her
deduction

Dont you see she continued that there are men enough to say
pleasant things to me and that what I want is a friend who wont be
afraid to say disagreeable ones when I need them Sometimes I have
fancied you might be that friendI dont know why except that you are
neither a prig nor a bounder and that I shouldnt have to pretend with
you or be on my guard against you Her voice had dropped to a note of
seriousness and she sat gazing up at him with the troubled gravity of a
child

You dont know how much I need such a friend she said My aunt is
full of copybook axioms but they were all meant to apply to conduct in
the early fifties I always feel that to live up to them would include
wearing bookmuslin with gigot sleeves And the other womenmy best
friendswell they use me or abuse me but they dont care a straw what
happens to me Ive been about too longpeople are getting tired of me
they are beginning to say I ought to marry

There was a moments pause during which Selden meditated one or two
replies calculated to add a momentary zest to the situation but he
rejected them in favour of the simple question Well why dont you

She coloured and laughed Ah I see you ARE a friend after all and that
is one of the disagreeable things I was asking for

It wasnt meant to be disagreeable he returned amicably Isnt
marriage your vocation Isnt it what youre all brought up for

She sighed I suppose so What else is there

Exactly And so why not take the plunge and have it over

She shrugged her shoulders You speak as if I ought to marry the first
man who came along

I didnt mean to imply that you are as hard put to it as that But there
must be some one with the requisite qualifications

She shook her head wearily I threw away one or two good chances when I
first came outI suppose every girl does and you know I am horribly
poorand very expensive I must have a great deal of money

Selden had turned to reach for a cigarettebox on the mantelpiece

Whats become of Dillworth he asked

Oh his mother was frightenedshe was afraid I should have all the
family jewels reset And she wanted me to promise that I wouldnt do over
the drawingroom

The very thing you are marrying for

Exactly So she packed him off to India

Hard luckbut you can do better than Dillworth

He offered the box and she took out three or four cigarettes putting
one between her lips and slipping the others into a little gold case
attached to her long pearl chain

Have I time Just a whiff then She leaned forward holding the tip of
her cigarette to his As she did so he noted with a purely impersonal
enjoyment how evenly the black lashes were set in her smooth white lids
and how the purplish shade beneath them melted into the pure pallour of
the cheek

She began to saunter about the room examining the bookshelves between
the puffs of her cigarettesmoke Some of the volumes had the ripe tints
of good tooling and old morocco and her eyes lingered on them
caressingly not with the appreciation of the expert but with the
pleasure in agreeable tones and textures that was one of her inmost
susceptibilities Suddenly her expression changed from desultory
enjoyment to active conjecture and she turned to Selden with a question

You collect dont youyou know about first editions and things

As much as a man may who has no money to spend Now and then I pick up
something in the rubbish heap and I go and look on at the big sales

She had again addressed herself to the shelves but her eyes now swept
them inattentively and he saw that she was preoccupied with a new idea

And Americanado you collect Americana

Selden stared and laughed

No thats rather out of my line Im not really a collector you see I
simply like to have good editions of the books I am fond of

She made a slight grimace And Americana are horribly dull I suppose

I should fancy soexcept to the historian But your real collector
values a thing for its rarity I dont suppose the buyers of Americana
sit up reading them all nightold Jefferson Gryce certainly didnt

She was listening with keen attention And yet they fetch fabulous
prices dont they It seems so odd to want to pay a lot for an ugly
badlyprinted book that one is never going to read And I suppose most
of the owners of Americana are not historians either

No very few of the historians can afford to buy them They have to use
those in the public libraries or in private collections It seems to be
the mere rarity that attracts the average collector

He had seated himself on an arm of the chair near which she was standing
and she continued to question him asking which were the rarest volumes
whether the Jefferson Gryce collection was really considered the finest
in the world and what was the largest price ever fetched by a single
volume

It was so pleasant to sit there looking up at her as she lifted now one
book and then another from the shelves fluttering the pages between her
fingers while her drooping profile was outlined against the warm
background of old bindings that he talked on without pausing to wonder
at her sudden interest in so unsuggestive a subject But he could never
be long with her without trying to find a reason for what she was doing
and as she replaced his first edition of La Bruyere and turned away from
the bookcases he began to ask himself what she had been driving at Her
next question was not of a nature to enlighten him She paused before him
with a smile which seemed at once designed to admit him to her
familiarity and to remind him of the restrictions it imposed

Dont you ever mind she asked suddenly not being rich enough to buy
all the books you want

He followed her glance about the room with its worn furniture and shabby
walls

Dont I just Do you take me for a saint on a pillar

And having to workdo you mind that

Oh the work itself is not so badIm rather fond of the law

No but the being tied down the routinedont you ever want to get
away to see new places and people

Horriblyespecially when I see all my friends rushing to the steamer

She drew a sympathetic breath But do you mind enoughto marry to get
out of it

Selden broke into a laugh God forbid he declared

She rose with a sigh tossing her cigarette into the grate

Ah theres the differencea girl must a man may if he chooses She
surveyed him critically Your coats a little shabbybut who cares It
doesnt keep people from asking you to dine If I were shabby no one
would have me a woman is asked out as much for her clothes as for
herself The clothes are the background the frame if you like they
dont make success but they are a part of it Who wants a dingy woman
We are expected to be pretty and welldressed till we dropand if we
cant keep it up alone we have to go into partnership

Selden glanced at her with amusement it was impossible even with her
lovely eyes imploring him to take a sentimental view of her case

Ah well there must be plenty of capital on the lookout for such an
investment Perhaps youll meet your fate tonight at the Trenors

She returned his look interrogatively

I thought you might be going thereoh not in that capacity But there
are to be a lot of your setGwen Van Osburgh the Wetheralls Lady
Cressida Raithand the George Dorsets

She paused a moment before the last name and shot a query through her
lashes but he remained imperturbable

Mrs Trenor asked me but I cant get away till the end of the week and
those big parties bore me

Ah so they do me she exclaimed

Then why go

Its part of the businessyou forget And besides if I didnt I
should be playing bezique with my aunt at Richfield Springs

Thats almost as bad as marrying Dillworth he agreed and they both
laughed for pure pleasure in their sudden intimacy

She glanced at the clock

Dear me I must be off Its after five

She paused before the mantelpiece studying herself in the mirror while
she adjusted her veil The attitude revealed the long slope of her
slender sides which gave a kind of wildwood grace to her outlineas
though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the
drawingroom and Selden reflected that it was the same streak of sylvan
freedom in her nature that lent such savour to her artificiality

He followed her across the room to the entrancehall but on the
threshold she held out her hand with a gesture of leavetaking

Its been delightful and now you will have to return my visit

But dont you want me to see you to the station

No good bye here please

She let her hand lie in his a moment smiling up at him adorably

Good bye thenand good luck at Bellomont he said opening the door
for her

On the landing she paused to look about her There were a thousand
chances to one against her meeting anybody but one could never tell and
she always paid for her rare indiscretions by a violent reaction of
prudence There was no one in sight however but a charwoman who was
scrubbing the stairs Her own stout person and its surrounding implements
took up so much room that Lily to pass her had to gather up her skirts
and brush against the wall As she did so the woman paused in her work
and looked up curiously resting her clenched red fists on the wet cloth
she had just drawn from her pail She had a broad sallow face slightly
pitted with smallpox and thin strawcoloured hair through which her
scalp shone unpleasantly

I beg your pardon said Lily intending by her politeness to convey a
criticism of the others manner

The woman without answering pushed her pail aside and continued to
stare as Miss Bart swept by with a murmur of silken linings Lily felt
herself flushing under the look What did the creature suppose Could one
never do the simplest the most harmless thing without subjecting ones
self to some odious conjecture Half way down the next flight she smiled
to think that a charwomans stare should so perturb her The poor thing
was probably dazzled by such an unwonted apparition But WERE such
apparitions unwonted on Seldens stairs Miss Bart was not familiar with
the moral code of bachelors flathouses and her colour rose again as it
occurred to her that the womans persistent gaze implied a groping among
past associations But she put aside the thought with a smile at her own
fears and hastened downward wondering if she should find a cab short of
Fifth Avenue

Under the Georgian porch she paused again scanning the street for a
hansom None was in sight but as she reached the sidewalk she ran
against a small glossylooking man with a gardenia in his coat who
raised his hat with a surprised exclamation

Miss Bart Wellof all people This IS luck he declared and she
caught a twinkle of amused curiosity between his screwedup lids

Oh Mr Rosedalehow are you she said perceiving that the
irrepressible annoyance on her face was reflected in the sudden intimacy
of his smile

Mr Rosedale stood scanning her with interest and approval He was a
plump rosy man of the blond Jewish type with smart London clothes
fitting him like upholstery and small sidelong eyes which gave him the
air of appraising people as if they were bricabrac He glanced up
interrogatively at the porch of the Benedick

Been up to town for a little shopping I suppose he said in a tone
which had the familiarity of a touch

Miss Bart shrank from it slightly and then flung herself into
precipitate explanations

YesI came up to see my dressmaker I am just on my way to catch the
train to the Trenors

Ahyour dressmaker just so he said blandly I didnt know there
were any dressmakers in the Benedick

The Benedick She looked gently puzzled Is that the name of this
building

Yes thats the name I believe its an old word for bachelor isnt it
I happen to own the buildingthats the way I know His smile deepened
as he added with increasing assurance But you must let me take you to
the station The Trenors are at Bellomont of course Youve barely time
to catch the fiveforty The dressmaker kept you waiting I suppose

Lily stiffened under the pleasantry

Oh thanks she stammered and at that moment her eye caught a hansom
drifting down Madison Avenue and she hailed it with a desperate gesture

Youre very kind but I couldnt think of troubling you she said
extending her hand to Mr Rosedale and heedless of his protestations
she sprang into the rescuing vehicle and called out a breathless order
to the driver



Chapter 2

In the hansom she leaned back with a sigh Why must a girl pay so dearly
for her least escape from routine Why could one never do a natural thing
without having to screen it behind a structure of artifice She had
yielded to a passing impulse in going to Lawrence Seldens rooms and it
was so seldom that she could allow herself the luxury of an impulse This
one at any rate was going to cost her rather more than she could
afford She was vexed to see that in spite of so many years of
vigilance she had blundered twice within five minutes That stupid story
about her dressmaker was bad enoughit would have been so simple to
tell Rosedale that she had been taking tea with Selden The mere
statement of the fact would have rendered it innocuous But after having
let herself be surprised in a falsehood it was doubly stupid to snub the
witness of her discomfiture If she had had the presence of mind to let
Rosedale drive her to the station the concession might have purchased
his silence He had his races accuracy in the appraisal of values and
to be seen walking down the platform at the crowded afternoon hour in the
company of Miss Lily Bart would have been money in his pocket as he
might himself have phrased it He knew of course that there would be a
large houseparty at Bellomont and the possibility of being taken for
one of Mrs Trenors guests was doubtless included in his calculations
Mr Rosedale was still at a stage in his social ascent when it was of
importance to produce such impressions

The provoking part was that Lily knew all thisknew how easy it would
have been to silence him on the spot and how difficult it might be to do
so afterward Mr Simon Rosedale was a man who made it his business to
know everything about every one whose idea of showing himself to be at
home in society was to display an inconvenient familiarity with the
habits of those with whom he wished to be thought intimate Lily was sure
that within twentyfour hours the story of her visiting her dressmaker
at the Benedick would be in active circulation among Mr Rosedales
acquaintances The worst of it was that she had always snubbed and
ignored him On his first appearancewhen her improvident cousin Jack
Stepney had obtained for him in return for favours too easily guessed
a card to one of the vast impersonal Van Osburgh crushesRosedale
with that mixture of artistic sensibility and business astuteness which
characterizes his race had instantly gravitated toward Miss Bart She
understood his motives for her own course was guided by as nice
calculations Training and experience had taught her to be hospitable to
newcomers since the most unpromising might be useful later on and there
were plenty of available OUBLIETTES to swallow them if they were not But
some intuitive repugnance getting the better of years of social
discipline had made her push Mr Rosedale into his OUBLIETTE without a
trial He had left behind only the ripple of amusement which his speedy
despatch had caused among her friends and though later to shift the
metaphor he reappeared lower down the stream it was only in fleeting
glimpses with long submergences between

Hitherto Lily had been undisturbed by scruples In her little set Mr
Rosedale had been pronounced impossible and Jack Stepney roundly
snubbed for his attempt to pay his debts in dinner invitations Even Mrs
Trenor whose taste for variety had led her into some hazardous
experiments resisted Jacks attempts to disguise Mr Rosedale as a
novelty and declared that he was the same little Jew who had been served
up and rejected at the social board a dozen times within her memory and
while Judy Trenor was obdurate there was small chance of Mr Rosedales
penetrating beyond the outer limbo of the Van Osburgh crushes Jack gave
up the contest with a laughing Youll see and sticking manfully to
his guns showed himself with Rosedale at the fashionable restaurants in
company with the personally vivid if socially obscure ladies who are
available for such purposes But the attempt had hitherto been vain and
as Rosedale undoubtedly paid for the dinners the laugh remained with his
debtor

Mr Rosedale it will be seen was thus far not a factor to be
fearedunless one put ones self in his power And this was precisely
what Miss Bart had done Her clumsy fib had let him see that she had
something to conceal and she was sure he had a score to settle with her
Something in his smile told her he had not forgotten She turned from the
thought with a little shiver but it hung on her all the way to the
station and dogged her down the platform with the persistency of Mr
Rosedale himself

She had just time to take her seat before the train started but having
arranged herself in her corner with the instinctive feeling for effect
which never forsook her she glanced about in the hope of seeing some
other member of the Trenors party She wanted to get away from herself
and conversation was the only means of escape that she knew

Her search was rewarded by the discovery of a very blond young man with a
soft reddish beard who at the other end of the carriage appeared to be
dissembling himself behind an unfolded newspaper Lilys eye brightened
and a faint smile relaxed the drawn lines of her mouth She had known
that Mr Percy Gryce was to be at Bellomont but she had not counted on
the luck of having him to herself in the train and the fact banished all
perturbing thoughts of Mr Rosedale Perhaps after all the day was to
end more favourably than it had begun

She began to cut the pages of a novel tranquilly studying her prey
through downcast lashes while she organized a method of attack
Something in his attitude of conscious absorption told her that he was
aware of her presence no one had ever been quite so engrossed in an
evening paper She guessed that he was too shy to come up to her and
that she would have to devise some means of approach which should not
appear to be an advance on her part It amused her to think that any one
as rich as Mr Percy Gryce should be shy but she was gifted with
treasures of indulgence for such idiosyncrasies and besides his
timidity might serve her purpose better than too much assurance She had
the art of giving selfconfidence to the embarrassed but she was not
equally sure of being able to embarrass the selfconfident

She waited till the train had emerged from the tunnel and was racing
between the ragged edges of the northern suburbs Then as it lowered its
speed near Yonkers she rose from her seat and drifted slowly down the
carriage As she passed Mr Gryce the train gave a lurch and he was
aware of a slender hand gripping the back of his chair He rose with a
start his ingenuous face looking as though it had been dipped in
crimson even the reddish tint in his beard seemed to deepen The train
swayed again almost flinging Miss Bart into his arms

She steadied herself with a laugh and drew back but he was enveloped in
the scent of her dress and his shoulder had felt her fugitive touch

Oh Mr Gryce is it you Im so sorryI was trying to find the porter
and get some tea

She held out her hand as the train resumed its level rush and they stood
exchanging a few words in the aisle Yeshe was going to Bellomont He
had heard she was to be of the partyhe blushed again as he admitted it
And was he to be there for a whole week How delightful

But at this point one or two belated passengers from the last station
forced their way into the carriage and Lily had to retreat to her seat

The chair next to mine is emptydo take it she said over her
shoulder and Mr Gryce with considerable embarrassment succeeded in
effecting an exchange which enabled him to transport himself and his bags
to her side

Ahand here is the porter and perhaps we can have some tea

She signalled to that official and in a moment with the ease that
seemed to attend the fulfilment of all her wishes a little table had
been set up between the seats and she had helped Mr Gryce to bestow his
encumbering properties beneath it

When the tea came he watched her in silent fascination while her hands
flitted above the tray looking miraculously fine and slender in contrast
to the coarse china and lumpy bread It seemed wonderful to him that any
one should perform with such careless ease the difficult task of making
tea in public in a lurching train He would never have dared to order it
for himself lest he should attract the notice of his fellowpassengers
but secure in the shelter of her conspicuousness he sipped the inky
draught with a delicious sense of exhilaration

Lily with the flavour of Seldens caravan tea on her lips had no great
fancy to drown it in the railway brew which seemed such nectar to her
companion but rightly judging that one of the charms of tea is the fact
of drinking it together she proceeded to give the last touch to Mr
Gryces enjoyment by smiling at him across her lifted cup

Is it quite rightI havent made it too strong she asked
solicitously and he replied with conviction that he had never tasted
better tea

I daresay it is true she reflected and her imagination was fired by
the thought that Mr Gryce who might have sounded the depths of the most
complex selfindulgence was perhaps actually taking his first journey
alone with a pretty woman

It struck her as providential that she should be the instrument of his
initiation Some girls would not have known how to manage him They would
have overemphasized the novelty of the adventure trying to make him
feel in it the zest of an escapade But Lilys methods were more
delicate She remembered that her cousin Jack Stepney had once defined
Mr Gryce as the young man who had promised his mother never to go out in
the rain without his overshoes and acting on this hint she resolved to
impart a gently domestic air to the scene in the hope that her
companion instead of feeling that he was doing something reckless or
unusual would merely be led to dwell on the advantage of always having a
companion to make ones tea in the train

But in spite of her efforts conversation flagged after the tray had been
removed and she was driven to take a fresh measurement of Mr Gryces
limitations It was not after all opportunity but imagination that he
lacked he had a mental palate which would never learn to distinguish
between railway tea and nectar There was however one topic she could
rely on one spring that she had only to touch to set his simple
machinery in motion She had refrained from touching it because it was a
last resource and she had relied on other arts to stimulate other
sensations but as a settled look of dulness began to creep over his
candid features she saw that extreme measures were necessary

And how she said leaning forward are you getting on with your
Americana

His eye became a degree less opaque it was as though an incipient film
had been removed from it and she felt the pride of a skilful operator

Ive got a few new things he said suffused with pleasure but
lowering his voice as though he feared his fellowpassengers might be in
league to despoil him

She returned a sympathetic enquiry and gradually he was drawn on to talk
of his latest purchases It was the one subject which enabled him to
forget himself or allowed him rather to remember himself without
constraint because he was at home in it and could assert a superiority
that there were few to dispute Hardly any of his acquaintances cared for
Americana or knew anything about them and the consciousness of this
ignorance threw Mr Gryces knowledge into agreeable relief The only
difficulty was to introduce the topic and to keep it to the front most
people showed no desire to have their ignorance dispelled and Mr Gryce
was like a merchant whose warehouses are crammed with an unmarketable
commodity

But Miss Bart it appeared really did want to know about Americana and
moreover she was already sufficiently informed to make the task of
farther instruction as easy as it was agreeable She questioned him
intelligently she heard him submissively and prepared for the look of
lassitude which usually crept over his listeners faces he grew eloquent
under her receptive gaze The points she had had the presence of mind
to glean from Selden in anticipation of this very contingency were
serving her to such good purpose that she began to think her visit to him
had been the luckiest incident of the day She had once more shown her
talent for profiting by the unexpected and dangerous theories as to the
advisability of yielding to impulse were germinating under the surface of
smiling attention which she continued to present to her companion

Mr Gryces sensations if less definite were equally agreeable He
felt the confused titillation with which the lower organisms welcome the
gratification of their needs and all his senses floundered in a vague
wellbeing through which Miss Barts personality was dimly but
pleasantly perceptible

Mr Gryces interest in Americana had not originated with himself it was
impossible to think of him as evolving any taste of his own An uncle had
left him a collection already noted among bibliophiles the existence of
the collection was the only fact that had ever shed glory on the name of
Gryce and the nephew took as much pride in his inheritance as though it
had been his own work Indeed he gradually came to regard it as such
and to feel a sense of personal complacency when he chanced on any
reference to the Gryce Americana Anxious as he was to avoid personal
notice he took in the printed mention of his name a pleasure so
exquisite and excessive that it seemed a compensation for his shrinking
from publicity

To enjoy the sensation as often as possible he subscribed to all the
reviews dealing with bookcollecting in general and American history in
particular and as allusions to his library abounded in the pages of
these journals which formed his only reading he came to regard himself
as figuring prominently in the public eye and to enjoy the thought of
the interest which would be excited if the persons he met in the street
or sat among in travelling were suddenly to be told that he was the
possessor of the Gryce Americana

Most timidities have such secret compensations and Miss Bart was
discerning enough to know that the inner vanity is generally in
proportion to the outer selfdepreciation With a more confident person
she would not have dared to dwell so long on one topic or to show such
exaggerated interest in it but she had rightly guessed that Mr Gryces
egoism was a thirsty soil requiring constant nurture from without Miss
Bart had the gift of following an undercurrent of thought while she
appeared to be sailing on the surface of conversation and in this case
her mental excursion took the form of a rapid survey of Mr Percy Gryces
future as combined with her own The Gryces were from Albany and but
lately introduced to the metropolis where the mother and son had come
after old Jefferson Gryces death to take possession of his house in
Madison Avenuean appalling house all brown stone without and black
walnut within with the Gryce library in a fireproof annex that looked
like a mausoleum Lily however knew all about them young Mr Gryces
arrival had fluttered the maternal breasts of New York and when a girl
has no mother to palpitate for her she must needs be on the alert for
herself Lily therefore had not only contrived to put herself in the
young mans way but had made the acquaintance of Mrs Gryce a
monumental woman with the voice of a pulpit orator and a mind preoccupied
with the iniquities of her servants who came sometimes to sit with Mrs
Peniston and learn from that lady how she managed to prevent the
kitchenmaids smuggling groceries out of the house Mrs Gryce had a
kind of impersonal benevolence cases of individual need she regarded
with suspicion but she subscribed to Institutions when their annual
reports showed an impressive surplus Her domestic duties were manifold
for they extended from furtive inspections of the servants bedrooms to
unannounced descents to the cellar but she had never allowed herself
many pleasures Once however she had had a special edition of the Sarum
Rule printed in rubric and presented to every clergyman in the diocese
and the gilt album in which their letters of thanks were pasted formed
the chief ornament of her drawingroom table

Percy had been brought up in the principles which so excellent a woman
was sure to inculcate Every form of prudence and suspicion had been
grafted on a nature originally reluctant and cautious with the result
that it would have seemed hardly needful for Mrs Gryce to extract his
promise about the overshoes so little likely was he to hazard himself
abroad in the rain After attaining his majority and coming into the
fortune which the late Mr Gryce had made out of a patent device for
excluding fresh air from hotels the young man continued to live with his
mother in Albany but on Jefferson Gryces death when another large
property passed into her sons hands Mrs Gryce thought that what she
called his interests demanded his presence in New York She accordingly
installed herself in the Madison Avenue house and Percy whose sense of
duty was not inferior to his mothers spent all his week days in the
handsome Broad Street office where a batch of pale men on small salaries
had grown grey in the management of the Gryce estate and where he was
initiated with becoming reverence into every detail of the art of
accumulation

As far as Lily could learn this had hitherto been Mr Gryces only
occupation and she might have been pardoned for thinking it not too hard
a task to interest a young man who had been kept on such low diet At
any rate she felt herself so completely in command of the situation that
she yielded to a sense of security in which all fear of Mr Rosedale and
of the difficulties on which that fear was contingent vanished beyond
the edge of thought

The stopping of the train at Garrisons would not have distracted her from
these thoughts had she not caught a sudden look of distress in her
companions eye His seat faced toward the door and she guessed that he
had been perturbed by the approach of an acquaintance a fact confirmed
by the turning of heads and general sense of commotion which her own
entrance into a railwaycarriage was apt to produce

She knew the symptoms at once and was not surprised to be hailed by the
high notes of a pretty woman who entered the train accompanied by a
maid a bullterrier and a footman staggering under a load of bags and
dressingcases

Oh Lilyare you going to Bellomont Then you cant let me have your
seat I suppose But I MUST have a seat in this carriageporter you
must find me a place at once Cant some one be put somewhere else I
want to be with my friends Oh how do you do Mr Gryce Do please make
him understand that I must have a seat next to you and Lily

Mrs George Dorset regardless of the mild efforts of a traveller with a
carpetbag who was doing his best to make room for her by getting out of
the train stood in the middle of the aisle diffusing about her that
general sense of exasperation which a pretty woman on her travels not
infrequently creates

She was smaller and thinner than Lily Bart with a restless pliability of
pose as if she could have been crumpled up and run through a ring like
the sinuous draperies she affected Her small pale face seemed the mere
setting of a pair of dark exaggerated eyes of which the visionary gaze
contrasted curiously with her selfassertive tone and gestures so that
as one of her friends observed she was like a disembodied spirit who
took up a great deal of room

Having finally discovered that the seat adjoining Miss Barts was at her
disposal she possessed herself of it with a farther displacement of her
surroundings explaining meanwhile that she had come across from Mount
Kisco in her motorcar that morning and had been kicking her heels for
an hour at Garrisons without even the alleviation of a cigarette her
brute of a husband having neglected to replenish her case before they
parted that morning

And at this hour of the day I dont suppose youve a single one left
have you Lily she plaintively concluded

Miss Bart caught the startled glance of Mr Percy Gryce whose own lips
were never defiled by tobacco

What an absurd question Bertha she exclaimed blushing at the thought
of the store she had laid in at Lawrence Seldens

Why dont you smoke Since when have you given it up Whatyou
never And you dont either Mr Gryce Ah of coursehow stupid of
meI understand

And Mrs Dorset leaned back against her travelling cushions with a smile
which made Lily wish there had been no vacant seat beside her own



Chapter 3

Bridge at Bellomont usually lasted till the small hours and when Lily
went to bed that night she had played too long for her own good

Feeling no desire for the selfcommunion which awaited her in her room
she lingered on the broad stairway looking down into the hall below
where the last cardplayers were grouped about the tray of tall glasses
and silvercollared decanters which the butler had just placed on a low
table near the fire

The hall was arcaded with a gallery supported on columns of pale yellow
marble Tall clumps of flowering plants were grouped against a background
of dark foliage in the angles of the walls On the crimson carpet a
deerhound and two or three spaniels dozed luxuriously before the fire
and the light from the great central lantern overhead shed a brightness
on the womens hair and struck sparks from their jewels as they moved

There were moments when such scenes delighted Lily when they gratified
her sense of beauty and her craving for the external finish of life
there were others when they gave a sharper edge to the meagreness of her
own opportunities This was one of the moments when the sense of contrast
was uppermost and she turned away impatiently as Mrs George Dorset
glittering in serpentine spangles drew Percy Gryce in her wake to a
confidential nook beneath the gallery

It was not that Miss Bart was afraid of losing her newlyacquired hold
over Mr Gryce Mrs Dorset might startle or dazzle him but she had
neither the skill nor the patience to effect his capture She was too
selfengrossed to penetrate the recesses of his shyness and besides why
should she care to give herself the trouble At most it might amuse her
to make sport of his simplicity for an eveningafter that he would be
merely a burden to her and knowing this she was far too experienced to
encourage him But the mere thought of that other woman who could take a
man up and toss him aside as she willed without having to regard him as
a possible factor in her plans filled Lily Bart with envy She had been
bored all the afternoon by Percy Grycethe mere thought seemed to waken
an echo of his droning voicebut she could not ignore him on the morrow
she must follow up her success must submit to more boredom must be
ready with fresh compliances and adaptabilities and all on the bare
chance that he might ultimately decide to do her the honour of boring her
for life

It was a hateful fatebut how escape from it What choice had she To be
herself or a Gerty Farish As she entered her bedroom with its
softlyshaded lights her lace dressinggown lying across the silken
bedspread her little embroidered slippers before the fire a vase of
carnations filling the air with perfume and the last novels and
magazines lying uncut on a table beside the readinglamp she had a
vision of Miss Farishs cramped flat with its cheap conveniences and
hideous wallpapers No she was not made for mean and shabby
surroundings for the squalid compromises of poverty Her whole being
dilated in an atmosphere of luxury it was the background she required
the only climate she could breathe in But the luxury of others was not
what she wanted A few years ago it had sufficed her she had taken her
daily meed of pleasure without caring who provided it Now she was
beginning to chafe at the obligations it imposed to feel herself a mere
pensioner on the splendour which had once seemed to belong to her There
were even moments when she was conscious of having to pay her way

For a long time she had refused to play bridge She knew she could not
afford it and she was afraid of acquiring so expensive a taste She had
seen the danger exemplified in more than one of her associatesin young
Ned Silverton for instance the charming fair boy now seated in abject
rapture at the elbow of Mrs Fisher a striking divorcee with eyes and
gowns as emphatic as the headlines of her case Lily could remember
when young Silverton had stumbled into their circle with the air of a
strayed Arcadian who has published charming sonnets in his college journal
Since then he had developed a taste for Mrs Fisher and bridge and the
latter at least had involved him in expenses from which he had been more
than once rescued by harassed maiden sisters who treasured the sonnets
and went without sugar in their tea to keep their darling afloat Neds
case was familiar to Lily she had seen his charming eyeswhich had a
good deal more poetry in them than the sonnetschange from surprise to
amusement and from amusement to anxiety as he passed under the spell
of the terrible god of chance and she was afraid of discovering the
same symptoms in her own case

For in the last year she had found that her hostesses expected her to
take a place at the cardtable It was one of the taxes she had to pay
for their prolonged hospitality and for the dresses and trinkets which
occasionally replenished her insufficient wardrobe And since she had
played regularly the passion had grown on her Once or twice of late she
had won a large sum and instead of keeping it against future losses had
spent it in dress or jewelry and the desire to atone for this
imprudence combined with the increasing exhilaration of the game drove
her to risk higher stakes at each fresh venture She tried to excuse
herself on the plea that in the Trenor set if one played at all one
must either play high or be set down as priggish or stingy but she knew
that the gambling passion was upon her and that in her present
surroundings there was small hope of resisting it

Tonight the luck had been persistently bad and the little gold purse
which hung among her trinkets was almost empty when she returned to her
room She unlocked the wardrobe and taking out her jewelcase looked
under the tray for the roll of bills from which she had replenished the
purse before going down to dinner Only twenty dollars were left the
discovery was so startling that for a moment she fancied she must have
been robbed Then she took paper and pencil and seating herself at the
writingtable tried to reckon up what she had spent during the day Her
head was throbbing with fatigue and she had to go over the figures again
and again but at last it became clear to her that she had lost three
hundred dollars at cards She took out her chequebook to see if her
balance was larger than she remembered but found she had erred in the
other direction Then she returned to her calculations but figure as she
would she could not conjure back the vanished three hundred dollars It
was the sum she had set aside to pacify her dressmakerunless she
should decide to use it as a sop to the jeweller At any rate she had so
many uses for it that its very insufficiency had caused her to play high
in the hope of doubling it But of course she had lostshe who needed
every penny while Bertha Dorset whose husband showered money on her
must have pocketed at least five hundred and Judy Trenor who could have
afforded to lose a thousand a night had left the table clutching such a
heap of bills that she had been unable to shake hands with her guests
when they bade her good night

A world in which such things could be seemed a miserable place to Lily
Bart but then she had never been able to understand the laws of a
universe which was so ready to leave her out of its calculations

She began to undress without ringing for her maid whom she had sent to
bed She had been long enough in bondage to other peoples pleasure to be
considerate of those who depended on hers and in her bitter moods it
sometimes struck her that she and her maid were in the same position
except that the latter received her wages more regularly

As she sat before the mirror brushing her hair her face looked hollow
and pale and she was frightened by two little lines near her mouth
faint flaws in the smooth curve of the cheek

Oh I must stop worrying she exclaimed Unless its the electric
light she reflected springing up from her seat and lighting the
candles on the dressingtable

She turned out the walllights and peered at herself between the
candleflames The white oval of her face swam out waveringly from a
background of shadows the uncertain light blurring it like a haze but
the two lines about the mouth remained

Lily rose and undressed in haste

It is only because I am tired and have such odious things to think
about she kept repeating and it seemed an added injustice that petty
cares should leave a trace on the beauty which was her only defence
against them

But the odious things were there and remained with her She returned
wearily to the thought of Percy Gryce as a wayfarer picks up a heavy
load and toils on after a brief rest She was almost sure she had
landed him a few days work and she would win her reward But the
reward itself seemed unpalatable just then she could get no zest from
the thought of victory It would be a rest from worry no moreand how
little that would have seemed to her a few years earlier Her ambitions
had shrunk gradually in the desiccating air of failure But why had she
failed Was it her own fault or that of destiny

She remembered how her mother after they had lost their money used to
say to her with a kind of fierce vindictiveness But youll get it all
backyoull get it all back with your face    The remembrance
roused a whole train of association and she lay in the darkness
reconstructing the past out of which her present had grown

A house in which no one ever dined at home unless there was company a
doorbell perpetually ringing a halltable showered with square
envelopes which were opened in haste and oblong envelopes which were
allowed to gather dust in the depths of a bronze jar a series of French
and English maids giving warning amid a chaos of hurriedlyransacked
wardrobes and dressclosets an equally changing dynasty of nurses and
footmen quarrels in the pantry the kitchen and the drawingroom
precipitate trips to Europe and returns with gorged trunks and days of
interminable unpacking semiannual discussions as to where the summer
should be spent grey interludes of economy and brilliant reactions of
expensesuch was the setting of Lily Barts first memories

Ruling the turbulent element called home was the vigorous and determined
figure of a mother still young enough to dance her balldresses to rags
while the hazy outline of a neutraltinted father filled an intermediate
space between the butler and the man who came to wind the clocks Even to
the eyes of infancy Mrs Hudson Bart had appeared young but Lily could
not recall the time when her father had not been bald and slightly
stooping with streaks of grey in his hair and a tired walk It was a
shock to her to learn afterward that he was but two years older than her
mother

Lily seldom saw her father by daylight All day he was down town and
in winter it was long after nightfall when she heard his fagged step on
the stairs and his hand on the schoolroom door He would kiss her in
silence and ask one or two questions of the nurse or the governess then
Mrs Barts maid would come to remind him that he was dining out and he
would hurry away with a nod to Lily In summer when he joined them for a
Sunday at Newport or Southampton he was even more effaced and silent
than in winter It seemed to tire him to rest and he would sit for hours
staring at the sealine from a quiet corner of the verandah while the
clatter of his wifes existence went on unheeded a few feet off
Generally however Mrs Bart and Lily went to Europe for the summer and
before the steamer was half way over Mr Bart had dipped below the
horizon Sometimes his daughter heard him denounced for having neglected
to forward Mrs Barts remittances but for the most part he was never
mentioned or thought of till his patient stooping figure presented itself
on the New York dock as a buffer between the magnitude of his wifes
luggage and the restrictions of the American customhouse

In this desultory yet agitated fashion life went on through Lilys teens
a zigzag broken course down which the family craft glided on a rapid
current of amusement tugged at by the underflow of a perpetual needthe
need of more money Lily could not recall the time when there had been
money enough and in some vague way her father seemed always to blame for
the deficiency It could certainly not be the fault of Mrs Bart who
was spoken of by her friends as a wonderful manager Mrs Bart was
famous for the unlimited effect she produced on limited means and to the
lady and her acquaintances there was something heroic in living as though
one were much richer than ones bankbook denoted

Lily was naturally proud of her mothers aptitude in this line she had
been brought up in the faith that whatever it cost one must have a good
cook and be what Mrs Bart called decently dressed Mrs Barts worst
reproach to her husband was to ask him if he expected her to live like a
pig and his replying in the negative was always regarded as a
justification for cabling to Paris for an extra dress or two and
telephoning to the jeweller that he might after all send home the
turquoise bracelet which Mrs Bart had looked at that morning

Lily knew people who lived like pigs and their appearance and
surroundings justified her mothers repugnance to that form of existence
They were mostly cousins who inhabited dingy houses with engravings from
Coles Voyage of Life on the drawingroom walls and slatternly
parlourmaids who said Ill go and see to visitors calling at an hour
when all rightminded persons are conventionally if not actually out The
disgusting part of it was that many of these cousins were rich so that
Lily imbibed the idea that if people lived like pigs it was from choice
and through the lack of any proper standard of conduct This gave her a
sense of reflected superiority and she did not need Mrs Barts comments
on the family frumps and misers to foster her naturally lively taste for
splendour

Lily was nineteen when circumstances caused her to revise her view of the
universe

The previous year she had made a dazzling debut fringed by a heavy
thundercloud of bills The light of the debut still lingered on the
horizon but the cloud had thickened and suddenly it broke The
suddenness added to the horror and there were still times when Lily
relived with painful vividness every detail of the day on which the blow
fell She and her mother had been seated at the luncheontable over the
CHAUFROIX and cold salmon of the previous nights dinner it was one of
Mrs Barts few economies to consume in private the expensive remnants of
her hospitality Lily was feeling the pleasant languor which is youths
penalty for dancing till dawn but her mother in spite of a few lines
about the mouth and under the yellow waves on her temples was as alert
determined and high in colour as if she had risen from an untroubled
sleep

In the centre of the table between the melting MARRONS GLACES and
candied cherries a pyramid of American Beauties lifted their vigorous
stems they held their heads as high as Mrs Bart but their rosecolour
had turned to a dissipated purple and Lilys sense of fitness was
disturbed by their reappearance on the luncheontable

I really think mother she said reproachfully we might afford a few
fresh flowers for luncheon Just some jonquils or liliesofthevalley

Mrs Bart stared Her own fastidiousness had its eye fixed on the world
and she did not care how the luncheontable looked when there was no one
present at it but the family But she smiled at her daughters innocence

Liliesofthevalley she said calmly cost two dollars a dozen at
this season

Lily was not impressed She knew very little of the value of money

It would not take more than six dozen to fill that bowl she argued

Six dozen what asked her fathers voice in the doorway

The two women looked up in surprise though it was a Saturday the sight
of Mr Bart at luncheon was an unwonted one But neither his wife nor his
daughter was sufficiently interested to ask an explanation

Mr Bart dropped into a chair and sat gazing absently at the fragment of
jellied salmon which the butler had placed before him

I was only saying Lily began that I hate to see faded flowers at
luncheon and mother says a bunch of liliesofthevalley would not cost
more than twelve dollars Maynt I tell the florist to send a few every
day

She leaned confidently toward her father he seldom refused her anything
and Mrs Bart had taught her to plead with him when her own entreaties
failed

Mr Bart sat motionless his gaze still fixed on the salmon and his
lower jaw dropped he looked even paler than usual and his thin hair lay
in untidy streaks on his forehead Suddenly he looked at his daughter and
laughed The laugh was so strange that Lily coloured under it she
disliked being ridiculed and her father seemed to see something
ridiculous in the request Perhaps he thought it foolish that she should
trouble him about such a trifle

Twelve dollarstwelve dollars a day for flowers Oh certainly my
deargive him an order for twelve hundred He continued to laugh

Mrs Bart gave him a quick glance

You neednt wait PoleworthI will ring for you she said to the
butler

The butler withdrew with an air of silent disapproval leaving the
remains of the CHAUFROIX on the sideboard

What is the matter Hudson Are you ill said Mrs Bart severely

She had no tolerance for scenes which were not of her own making and it
was odious to her that her husband should make a show of himself before
the servants

Are you ill she repeated

Ill No Im ruined he said

Lily made a frightened sound and Mrs Bart rose to her feet

Ruined she cried but controlling herself instantly she turned a
calm face to Lily

Shut the pantry door she said

Lily obeyed and when she turned back into the room her father was
sitting with both elbows on the table the plate of salmon between them
and his head bowed on his hands

Mrs Bart stood over him with a white face which made her hair
unnaturally yellow She looked at Lily as the latter approached her look
was terrible but her voice was modulated to a ghastly cheerfulness

Your father is not wellhe doesnt know what he is saying It is
nothingbut you had better go upstairs and dont talk to the servants
she added

Lily obeyed she always obeyed when her mother spoke in that voice She
had not been deceived by Mrs Barts words she knew at once that they
were ruined In the dark hours which followed that awful fact
overshadowed even her fathers slow and difficult dying To his wife he
no longer counted he had become extinct when he ceased to fulfil his
purpose and she sat at his side with the provisional air of a traveller
who waits for a belated train to start Lilys feelings were softer she
pitied him in a frightened ineffectual way But the fact that he was for
the most part unconscious and that his attention when she stole into
the room drifted away from her after a moment made him even more of a
stranger than in the nursery days when he had never come home till after
dark She seemed always to have seen him through a blurfirst of
sleepiness then of distance and indifferenceand now the fog had
thickened till he was almost indistinguishable If she could have
performed any little services for him or have exchanged with him a few
of those affecting words which an extensive perusal of fiction had led
her to connect with such occasions the filial instinct might have
stirred in her but her pity finding no active expression remained in a
state of spectatorship overshadowed by her mothers grim unflagging
resentment Every look and act of Mrs Barts seemed to say You are
sorry for him nowbut you will feel differently when you see what he has
done to us

It was a relief to Lily when her father died

Then a long winter set in There was a little money left but to Mrs
Bart it seemed worse than nothingthe mere mockery of what she was
entitled to What was the use of living if one had to live like a pig
She sank into a kind of furious apathy a state of inert anger against
fate Her faculty for managing deserted her or she no longer took
sufficient pride in it to exert it It was well enough to manage when
by so doing one could keep ones own carriage but when ones best
contrivance did not conceal the fact that one had to go on foot the
effort was no longer worth making

Lily and her mother wandered from place to place now paying long visits
to relations whose housekeeping Mrs Bart criticized and who deplored
the fact that she let Lily breakfast in bed when the girl had no
prospects before her and now vegetating in cheap continental refuges
where Mrs Bart held herself fiercely aloof from the frugal teatables of
her companions in misfortune She was especially careful to avoid her old
friends and the scenes of her former successes To be poor seemed to her
such a confession of failure that it amounted to disgrace and she
detected a note of condescension in the friendliest advances

Only one thought consoled her and that was the contemplation of Lilys
beauty She studied it with a kind of passion as though it were some
weapon she had slowly fashioned for her vengeance It was the last asset
in their fortunes the nucleus around which their life was to be rebuilt
She watched it jealously as though it were her own property and Lily its
mere custodian and she tried to instil into the latter a sense of the
responsibility that such a charge involved She followed in imagination
the career of other beauties pointing out to her daughter what might be
achieved through such a gift and dwelling on the awful warning of those
who in spite of it had failed to get what they wanted to Mrs Bart
only stupidity could explain the lamentable denouement of some of her
examples She was not above the inconsistency of charging fate rather
than herself with her own misfortunes but she inveighed so
acrimoniously against lovematches that Lily would have fancied her own
marriage had been of that nature had not Mrs Bart frequently assured
her that she had been talked into itby whom she never made clear

Lily was duly impressed by the magnitude of her opportunities The
dinginess of her present life threw into enchanting relief the existence
to which she felt herself entitled To a less illuminated intelligence
Mrs Barts counsels might have been dangerous but Lily understood that
beauty is only the raw material of conquest and that to convert it into
success other arts are required She knew that to betray any sense of
superiority was a subtler form of the stupidity her mother denounced and
it did not take her long to learn that a beauty needs more tact than the
possessor of an average set of features

Her ambitions were not as crude as Mrs Barts It had been among that
ladys grievances that her husbandin the early days before he was too
tiredhad wasted his evenings in what she vaguely described as reading
poetry and among the effects packed off to auction after his death were
a score or two of dingy volumes which had struggled for existence among
the boots and medicine bottles of his dressingroom shelves There was in
Lily a vein of sentiment perhaps transmitted from this source which
gave an idealizing touch to her most prosaic purposes She liked to think
of her beauty as a power for good as giving her the opportunity to
attain a position where she should make her influence felt in the vague
diffusion of refinement and good taste She was fond of pictures and
flowers and of sentimental fiction and she could not help thinking that
the possession of such tastes ennobled her desire for worldly advantages
She would not indeed have cared to marry a man who was merely rich she
was secretly ashamed of her mothers crude passion for money Lilys
preference would have been for an English nobleman with political
ambitions and vast estates or for second choice an Italian prince with
a castle in the Apennines and an hereditary office in the Vatican Lost
causes had a romantic charm for her and she liked to picture herself as
standing aloof from the vulgar press of the Quirinal and sacrificing her
pleasure to the claims of an immemorial tradition   

How long ago and how far off it all seemed Those ambitions were hardly
more futile and childish than the earlier ones which had centred about
the possession of a French jointed doll with real hair Was it only ten
years since she had wavered in imagination between the English earl and
the Italian prince Relentlessly her mind travelled on over the dreary
interval   

After two years of hungry roaming Mrs Bart had dieddied of a deep
disgust She had hated dinginess and it was her fate to be dingy Her
visions of a brilliant marriage for Lily had faded after the first year

People cant marry you if they dont see youand how can they see you
in these holes where were stuck That was the burden of her lament and
her last adjuration to her daughter was to escape from dinginess if she
could

Dont let it creep up on you and drag you down Fight your way out of it
somehowyoure young and can do it she insisted

She had died during one of their brief visits to New York and there Lily
at once became the centre of a family council composed of the wealthy
relatives whom she had been taught to despise for living like pigs It
may be that they had an inkling of the sentiments in which she had been
brought up for none of them manifested a very lively desire for her
company indeed the question threatened to remain unsolved till Mrs
Peniston with a sigh announced Ill try her for a year

Every one was surprised but one and all concealed their surprise lest
Mrs Peniston should be alarmed by it into reconsidering her decision

Mrs Peniston was Mr Barts widowed sister and if she was by no means
the richest of the family group its other members nevertheless abounded
in reasons why she was clearly destined by Providence to assume the
charge of Lily In the first place she was alone and it would be
charming for her to have a young companion Then she sometimes travelled
and Lilys familiarity with foreign customsdeplored as a misfortune by
her more conservative relativeswould at least enable her to act as a
kind of courier But as a matter of fact Mrs Peniston had not been
affected by these considerations She had taken the girl simply because
no one else would have her and because she had the kind of moral
MAUVAISE HONTE which makes the public display of selfishness difficult
though it does not interfere with its private indulgence It would have
been impossible for Mrs Peniston to be heroic on a desert island but
with the eyes of her little world upon her she took a certain pleasure in
her act

She reaped the reward to which disinterestedness is entitled and found
an agreeable companion in her niece She had expected to find Lily
headstrong critical and foreignfor even Mrs Peniston though she
occasionally went abroad had the family dread of foreignnessbut the
girl showed a pliancy which to a more penetrating mind than her aunts
might have been less reassuring than the open selfishness of youth
Misfortune had made Lily supple instead of hardening her and a pliable
substance is less easy to break than a stiff one

Mrs Peniston however did not suffer from her nieces adaptability
Lily had no intention of taking advantage of her aunts good nature She
was in truth grateful for the refuge offered her Mrs Penistons opulent
interior was at least not externally dingy But dinginess is a quality
which assumes all manner of disguises and Lily soon found that it was as
latent in the expensive routine of her aunts life as in the makeshift
existence of a continental pension

Mrs Peniston was one of the episodical persons who form the padding of
life It was impossible to believe that she had herself ever been a focus
of activities The most vivid thing about her was the fact that her
grandmother had been a Van Alstyne This connection with the wellfed and
industrious stock of early New York revealed itself in the glacial
neatness of Mrs Penistons drawingroom and in the excellence of her
cuisine She belonged to the class of old New Yorkers who have always
lived well dressed expensively and done little else and to these
inherited obligations Mrs Peniston faithfully conformed She had always
been a lookeron at life and her mind resembled one of those little
mirrors which her Dutch ancestors were accustomed to affix to their upper
windows so that from the depths of an impenetrable domesticity they
might see what was happening in the street

Mrs Peniston was the owner of a countryplace in New Jersey but she had
never lived there since her husbands deatha remote event which
appeared to dwell in her memory chiefly as a dividing point in the
personal reminiscences that formed the staple of her conversation She
was a woman who remembered dates with intensity and could tell at a
moments notice whether the drawingroom curtains had been renewed before
or after Mr Penistons last illness

Mrs Peniston thought the country lonely and trees damp and cherished a
vague fear of meeting a bull To guard against such contingencies she
frequented the more populous wateringplaces where she installed herself
impersonally in a hired house and looked on at life through the matting
screen of her verandah In the care of such a guardian it soon became
clear to Lily that she was to enjoy only the material advantages of good
food and expensive clothing and though far from underrating these she
would gladly have exchanged them for what Mrs Bart had taught her to
regard as opportunities She sighed to think what her mothers fierce
energies would have accomplished had they been coupled with Mrs
Penistons resources Lily had abundant energy of her own but it was
restricted by the necessity of adapting herself to her aunts habits She
saw that at all costs she must keep Mrs Penistons favour till as Mrs
Bart would have phrased it she could stand on her own legs Lily had no
mind for the vagabond life of the poor relation and to adapt herself to
Mrs Peniston she had to some degree to assume that ladys passive
attitude She had fancied at first that it would be easy to draw her aunt
into the whirl of her own activities but there was a static force in
Mrs Peniston against which her nieces efforts spent themselves in vain
To attempt to bring her into active relation with life was like tugging
at a piece of furniture which has been screwed to the floor She did not
indeed expect Lily to remain equally immovable she had all the American
guardians indulgence for the volatility of youth

She had indulgence also for certain other habits of her nieces It
seemed to her natural that Lily should spend all her money on dress and
she supplemented the girls scanty income by occasional handsome
presents meant to be applied to the same purpose Lily who was
intensely practical would have preferred a fixed allowance but Mrs
Peniston liked the periodical recurrence of gratitude evoked by
unexpected cheques and was perhaps shrewd enough to perceive that such a
method of giving kept alive in her niece a salutary sense of dependence

Beyond this Mrs Peniston had not felt called upon to do anything for
her charge she had simply stood aside and let her take the field Lily
had taken it at first with the confidence of assured possessorship then
with gradually narrowing demands till now she found herself actually
struggling for a foothold on the broad space which had once seemed her
own for the asking How it happened she did not yet know Sometimes she
thought it was because Mrs Peniston had been too passive and again she
feared it was because she herself had not been passive enough Had she
shown an undue eagerness for victory Had she lacked patience pliancy
and dissimulation Whether she charged herself with these faults or
absolved herself from them made no difference in the sumtotal of her
failure Younger and plainer girls had been married off by dozens and
she was nineandtwenty and still Miss Bart

She was beginning to have fits of angry rebellion against fate when she
longed to drop out of the race and make an independent life for herself
But what manner of life would it be She had barely enough money to pay
her dressmakers bills and her gambling debts and none of the desultory
interests which she dignified with the name of tastes was pronounced
enough to enable her to live contentedly in obscurity Ah noshe was
too intelligent not to be honest with herself She knew that she hated
dinginess as much as her mother had hated it and to her last breath she
meant to fight against it dragging herself up again and again above its
flood till she gained the bright pinnacles of success which presented
such a slippery surface to her clutch



Chapter 4

The next morning on her breakfast tray Miss Bart found a note from her
hostess

Dearest Lily it ran if it is not too much of a bore to be down by
ten will you come to my sittingroom to help me with some tiresome
things

Lily tossed aside the note and subsided on her pillows with a sigh It
WAS a bore to be down by tenan hour regarded at Bellomont as vaguely
synchronous with sunriseand she knew too well the nature of the
tiresome things in question Miss Pragg the secretary had been called
away and there would be notes and dinnercards to write lost addresses
to hunt up and other social drudgery to perform It was understood that
Miss Bart should fill the gap in such emergencies and she usually
recognized the obligation without a murmur

Today however it renewed the sense of servitude which the previous
nights review of her chequebook had produced Everything in her
surroundings ministered to feelings of ease and amenity The windows
stood open to the sparkling freshness of the September morning and
between the yellow boughs she caught a perspective of hedges and
parterres leading by degrees of lessening formality to the free
undulations of the park Her maid had kindled a little fire on the
hearth and it contended cheerfully with the sunlight which slanted
across the mossgreen carpet and caressed the curved sides of an old
marquetry desk Near the bed stood a table holding her breakfast tray
with its harmonious porcelain and silver a handful of violets in a
slender glass and the morning paper folded beneath her letters There
was nothing new to Lily in these tokens of a studied luxury but though
they formed a part of her atmosphere she never lost her sensitiveness to
their charm Mere display left her with a sense of superior distinction
but she felt an affinity to all the subtler manifestations of wealth

Mrs Trenors summons however suddenly recalled her state of
dependence and she rose and dressed in a mood of irritability that she
was usually too prudent to indulge She knew that such emotions leave
lines on the face as well as in the character and she had meant to take
warning by the little creases which her midnight survey had revealed

The matterofcourse tone of Mrs Trenors greeting deepened her
irritation If one did drag ones self out of bed at such an hour and
come down fresh and radiant to the monotony of notewriting some special
recognition of the sacrifice seemed fitting But Mrs Trenors tone
showed no consciousness of the fact

Oh Lily thats nice of you she merely sighed across the chaos of
letters bills and other domestic documents which gave an incongruously
commercial touch to the slender elegance of her writingtable

There are such lots of horrors this morning she added clearing a
space in the centre of the confusion and rising to yield her seat to Miss
Bart

Mrs Trenor was a tall fair woman whose height just saved her from
redundancy Her rosy blondness had survived some forty years of futile
activity without showing much trace of illusage except in a diminished
play of feature It was difficult to define her beyond saying that she
seemed to exist only as a hostess not so much from any exaggerated
instinct of hospitality as because she could not sustain life except in a
crowd The collective nature of her interests exempted her from the
ordinary rivalries of her sex and she knew no more personal emotion than
that of hatred for the woman who presumed to give bigger dinners or have
more amusing houseparties than herself As her social talents backed by
Mr Trenors bankaccount almost always assured her ultimate triumph in
such competitions success had developed in her an unscrupulous good
nature toward the rest of her sex and in Miss Barts utilitarian
classification of her friends Mrs Trenor ranked as the woman who was
least likely to go back on her

It was simply inhuman of Pragg to go off now Mrs Trenor declared as
her friend seated herself at the desk She says her sister is going to
have a babyas if that were anything to having a houseparty Im sure I
shall get most horribly mixed up and there will be some awful rows When
I was down at Tuxedo I asked a lot of people for next week and Ive
mislaid the list and cant remember who is coming And this week is going
to be a horrid failure tooand Gwen Van Osburgh will go back and tell
her mother how bored people were I did mean to ask the Wetherallsthat
was a blunder of Guss They disapprove of Carry Fisher you know As if
one could help having Carry Fisher It WAS foolish of her to get that
second divorceCarry always overdoes thingsbut she said the only way
to get a penny out of Fisher was to divorce him and make him pay alimony
And poor Carry has to consider every dollar Its really absurd of Alice
Wetherall to make such a fuss about meeting her when one thinks of what
society is coming to Some one said the other day that there was a
divorce and a case of appendicitis in every family one knows Besides
Carry is the only person who can keep Gus in a good humour when we have
bores in the house Have you noticed that ALL the husbands like her All
I mean except her own Its rather clever of her to have made a
specialty of devoting herself to dull peoplethe field is such a large
one and she has it practically to herself She finds compensations no
doubtI know she borrows money of Gusbut then Id PAY her to keep him
in a good humour so I cant complain after all

Mrs Trenor paused to enjoy the spectacle of Miss Barts efforts to
unravel her tangled correspondence

But it is only the Wetheralls and Carry she resumed with a fresh note
of lament The truth is Im awfully disappointed in Lady Cressida
Raith

Disappointed Had you known her before

Mercy nonever saw her till yesterday Lady Skiddaw sent her over with
letters to the Van Osburghs and I heard that Maria Van Osburgh was
asking a big party to meet her this week so I thought it would be fun to
get her away and Jack Stepney who knew her in India managed it for me
Maria was furious and actually had the impudence to make Gwen invite
herself here so that they shouldnt be QUITE out of itif Id known
what Lady Cressida was like they could have had her and welcome But I
thought any friend of the Skiddaws was sure to be amusing You remember
what fun Lady Skiddaw was There were times when I simply had to send the
girls out of the room Besides Lady Cressida is the Duchess of
Beltshires sister and I naturally supposed she was the same sort but
you never can tell in those English families They are so big that
theres room for all kinds and it turns out that Lady Cressida is the
moral onemarried a clergyman and does missionary work in the East End
Think of my taking such a lot of trouble about a clergymans wife who
wears Indian jewelry and botanizes She made Gus take her all through the
glasshouses yesterday and bothered him to death by asking him the names
of the plants Fancy treating Gus as if he were the gardener

Mrs Trenor brought this out in a CRESCENDO of indignation

Oh well perhaps Lady Cressida will reconcile the Wetheralls to meeting
Carry Fisher said Miss Bart pacifically

Im sure I hope so But she is boring all the men horribly and if she
takes to distributing tracts as I hear she does it will be too
depressing The worst of it is that she would have been so useful at the
right time You know we have to have the Bishop once a year and she
would have given just the right tone to things I always have horrid luck
about the Bishops visits added Mrs Trenor whose present misery was
being fed by a rapidly rising tide of reminiscence last year when he
came Gus forgot all about his being here and brought home the Ned
Wintons and the Farleysfive divorces and six sets of children between
them

When is Lady Cressida going Lily enquired

Mrs Trenor cast up her eyes in despair My dear if one only knew I
was in such a hurry to get her away from Maria that I actually forgot to
name a date and Gus says she told some one she meant to stop here all
winter

To stop here In this house

Dont be sillyin America But if no one else asks heryou know they
NEVER go to hotels

Perhaps Gus only said it to frighten you

NoI heard her tell Bertha Dorset that she had six months to put in
while her husband was taking the cure in the Engadine You should have
seen Bertha look vacant But its no joke you knowif she stays here
all the autumn shell spoil everything and Maria Van Osburgh will simply
exult

At this affecting vision Mrs Trenors voice trembled with selfpity

Oh Judyas if any one were ever bored at Bellomont Miss Bart
tactfully protested You know perfectly well that if Mrs Van Osburgh
were to get all the right people and leave you with all the wrong ones
youd manage to make things go off and she wouldnt

Such an assurance would usually have restored Mrs Trenors complacency
but on this occasion it did not chase the cloud from her brow

It isnt only Lady Cressida she lamented Everything has gone wrong
this week I can see that Bertha Dorset is furious with me

Furious with you Why

Because I told her that Lawrence Selden was coming but he wouldnt
after all and shes quite unreasonable enough to think its my fault

Miss Bart put down her pen and sat absently gazing at the note she had
begun

I thought that was all over she said

So it is on his side And of course Bertha has been idle since But I
fancy shes out of a job just at presentand some one gave me a hint
that I had better ask Lawrence Well I DID ask himbut I couldnt make
him come and now I suppose shell take it out of me by being perfectly
nasty to every one else

Oh she may take it out of HIM by being perfectly charmingto some one
else

Mrs Trenor shook her head dolefully She knows he wouldnt mind And
who else is there Alice Wetherall wont let Lucius out of her sight
Ned Silverton cant take his eyes off Carry Fisherpoor boy Gus is
bored by Bertha Jack Stepney knows her too wellandwell to be sure
theres Percy Gryce

She sat up smiling at the thought

Miss Barts countenance did not reflect the smile

Oh she and Mr Gryce would not be likely to hit it off

You mean that shed shock him and hed bore her Well thats not such a
bad beginning you know But I hope she wont take it into her head to be
nice to him for I asked him here on purpose for you

Lily laughed MERCI DU COMPLIMENT I should certainly have no show
against Bertha

Do you think I am uncomplimentary Im not really you know Every one
knows youre a thousand times handsomer and cleverer than Bertha but
then youre not nasty And for always getting what she wants in the long
run commend me to a nasty woman

Miss Bart stared in affected reproval I thought you were so fond of
Bertha

Oh I amits much safer to be fond of dangerous people But she IS
dangerousand if I ever saw her up to mischief its now I can tell by
poor Georges manner That man is a perfect barometerhe always knows
when Bertha is going to

To fall Miss Bart suggested

Dont be shocking You know he believes in her still And of course I
dont say theres any real harm in Bertha Only she delights in making
people miserable and especially poor George

Well he seems cut out for the partI dont wonder she likes more
cheerful companionship

Oh George is not as dismal as you think If Bertha did worry him he
would be quite different Or if shed leave him alone and let him
arrange his life as he pleases But she doesnt dare lose her hold of him
on account of the money and so when HE isnt jealous she pretends to be

Miss Bart went on writing in silence and her hostess sat following her
train of thought with frowning intensity

Do you know she exclaimed after a long pause I believe Ill call up
Lawrence on the telephone and tell him he simply MUST come

Oh dont said Lily with a quick suffusion of colour The blush
surprised her almost as much as it did her hostess who though not
commonly observant of facial changes sat staring at her with puzzled
eyes

Good gracious Lily how handsome you are Why Do you dislike him so
much

Not at all I like him But if you are actuated by the benevolent
intention of protecting me from BerthaI dont think I need your
protection

Mrs Trenor sat up with an exclamation LilyPERCY Do you mean to
say youve actually done it

Miss Bart smiled I only mean to say that Mr Gryce and I are getting to
be very good friends

HmI see Mrs Trenor fixed a rapt eye upon her You know they say
he has eight hundred thousand a yearand spends nothing except on some
rubbishy old books And his mother has heartdisease and will leave him a
lot more OH LILY DO GO SLOWLY her friend adjured her

Miss Bart continued to smile without annoyance I shouldnt for
instance she remarked be in any haste to tell him that he had a lot
of rubbishy old books

No of course not I know youre wonderful about getting up peoples
subjects But hes horribly shy and easily shocked andand

Why dont you say it Judy I have the reputation of being on the hunt
for a rich husband

Oh I dont mean that he wouldnt believe it of youat first said
Mrs Trenor with candid shrewdness But you know things are rather
lively here at timesI must give Jack and Gus a hintand if he thought
you were what his mother would call fastoh well you know what I mean
Dont wear your scarlet CREPEDECHINE for dinner and dont smoke if you
can help it Lily dear

Lily pushed aside her finished work with a dry smile Youre very kind
Judy Ill lock up my cigarettes and wear that last years dress you sent
me this morning And if you are really interested in my career perhaps
youll be kind enough not to ask me to play bridge again this evening

Bridge Does he mind bridge too Oh Lily what an awful life youll
lead But of course I wontwhy didnt you give me a hint last night
Theres nothing I wouldnt do you poor duck to see you happy

And Mrs Trenor glowing with her sexs eagerness to smooth the course of
true love enveloped Lily in a long embrace

Youre quite sure she added solicitously as the latter extricated
herself that you wouldnt like me to telephone for Lawrence Selden

Quite sure said Lily



The next three days demonstrated to her own complete satisfaction Miss
Barts ability to manage her affairs without extraneous aid

As she sat on the Saturday afternoon on the terrace at Bellomont she
smiled at Mrs Trenors fear that she might go too fast If such a
warning had ever been needful the years had taught her a salutary
lesson and she flattered herself that she now knew how to adapt her pace
to the object of pursuit In the case of Mr Gryce she had found it well
to flutter ahead losing herself elusively and luring him on from depth
to depth of unconscious intimacy The surrounding atmosphere was
propitious to this scheme of courtship Mrs Trenor true to her word
had shown no signs of expecting Lily at the bridgetable and had even
hinted to the other cardplayers that they were to betray no surprise at
her unwonted defection In consequence of this hint Lily found herself
the centre of that feminine solicitude which envelops a young woman in
the mating season A solitude was tacitly created for her in the crowded
existence of Bellomont and her friends could not have shown a greater
readiness for selfeffacement had her wooing been adorned with all the
attributes of romance In Lilys set this conduct implied a sympathetic
comprehension of her motives and Mr Gryce rose in her esteem as she saw
the consideration he inspired

The terrace at Bellomont on a September afternoon was a spot propitious
to sentimental musings and as Miss Bart stood leaning against the
balustrade above the sunken garden at a little distance from the
animated group about the teatable she might have been lost in the mazes
of an inarticulate happiness In reality her thoughts were finding
definite utterance in the tranquil recapitulation of the blessings in
store for her From where she stood she could see them embodied in the
form of Mr Gryce who in a light overcoat and muffler sat somewhat
nervously on the edge of his chair while Carry Fisher with all the
energy of eye and gesture with which nature and art had combined to endow
her pressed on him the duty of taking part in the task of municipal
reform

Mrs Fishers latest hobby was municipal reform It had been preceded by
an equal zeal for socialism which had in turn replaced an energetic
advocacy of Christian Science Mrs Fisher was small fiery and dramatic
and her hands and eyes were admirable instruments in the service of
whatever causes she happened to espouse She had however the fault
common to enthusiasts of ignoring any slackness of response on the part
of her hearers and Lily was amused by her unconsciousness of the
resistance displayed in every angle of Mr Gryces attitude Lily
herself knew that his mind was divided between the dread of catching cold
if he remained out of doors too long at that hour and the fear that if
he retreated to the house Mrs Fisher might follow him up with a paper
to be signed Mr Gryce had a constitutional dislike to what he called
committing himself and tenderly as he cherished his health he
evidently concluded that it was safer to stay out of reach of pen and ink
till chance released him from Mrs Fishers toils Meanwhile he cast
agonized glances in the direction of Miss Bart whose only response was
to sink into an attitude of more graceful abstraction She had learned
the value of contrast in throwing her charms into relief and was fully
aware of the extent to which Mrs Fishers volubility was enhancing her
own repose

She was roused from her musings by the approach of her cousin Jack
Stepney who at Gwen Van Osburghs side was returning across the garden
from the tennis court

The couple in question were engaged in the same kind of romance in which
Lily figured and the latter felt a certain annoyance in contemplating
what seemed to her a caricature of her own situation Miss Van Osburgh
was a large girl with flat surfaces and no high lights Jack Stepney had
once said of her that she was as reliable as roast mutton His own taste
was in the line of less solid and more highlyseasoned diet but hunger
makes any fare palatable and there had been times when Mr Stepney had
been reduced to a crust

Lily considered with interest the expression of their faces the girls
turned toward her companions like an empty plate held up to be filled
while the man lounging at her side already betrayed the encroaching
boredom which would presently crack the thin veneer of his smile

How impatient men are Lily reflected All Jack has to do to get
everything he wants is to keep quiet and let that girl marry him whereas
I have to calculate and contrive and retreat and advance as if I were
going through an intricate dance where one misstep would throw me
hopelessly out of time

As they drew nearer she was whimsically struck by a kind of family
likeness between Miss Van Osburgh and Percy Gryce There was no
resemblance of feature Gryce was handsome in a didactic wayhe looked
like a clever pupils drawing from a plastercastwhile Gwens
countenance had no more modelling than a face painted on a toy balloon
But the deeper affinity was unmistakable the two had the same prejudices
and ideals and the same quality of making other standards nonexistent
by ignoring them This attribute was common to most of Lilys set they
had a force of negation which eliminated everything beyond their own
range of perception Gryce and Miss Van Osburgh were in short made for
each other by every law of moral and physical correspondenceYet they
wouldnt look at each other Lily mused they never do Each of them
wants a creature of a different race of Jacks race and mine with all
sorts of intuitions sensations and perceptions that they dont even
guess the existence of And they always get what they want

She stood talking with her cousin and Miss Van Osburgh till a slight
cloud on the latters brow advised her that even cousinly amenities were
subject to suspicion and Miss Bart mindful of the necessity of not
exciting enmities at this crucial point of her career dropped aside
while the happy couple proceeded toward the teatable

Seating herself on the upper step of the terrace Lily leaned her head
against the honeysuckles wreathing the balustrade The fragrance of the
late blossoms seemed an emanation of the tranquil scene a landscape
tutored to the last degree of rural elegance In the foreground glowed
the warm tints of the gardens Beyond the lawn with its pyramidal
palegold maples and velvety firs sloped pastures dotted with cattle
and through a long glade the river widened like a lake under the silver
light of September Lily did not want to join the circle about the
teatable They represented the future she had chosen and she was
content with it but in no haste to anticipate its joys The certainty
that she could marry Percy Gryce when she pleased had lifted a heavy load
from her mind and her money troubles were too recent for their removal
not to leave a sense of relief which a less discerning intelligence might
have taken for happiness Her vulgar cares were at an end She would be
able to arrange her life as she pleased to soar into that empyrean of
security where creditors cannot penetrate She would have smarter gowns
than Judy Trenor and far far more jewels than Bertha Dorset She would
be free forever from the shifts the expedients the humiliations of the
relatively poor Instead of having to flatter she would be flattered
instead of being grateful she would receive thanks There were old
scores she could pay off as well as old benefits she could return And
she had no doubts as to the extent of her power She knew that Mr Gryce
was of the small chary type most inaccessible to impulses and emotions
He had the kind of character in which prudence is a vice and good advice
the most dangerous nourishment But Lily had known the species before
she was aware that such a guarded nature must find one huge outlet of
egoism and she determined to be to him what his Americana had hitherto
been the one possession in which he took sufficient pride to spend money
on it She knew that this generosity to self is one of the forms of
meanness and she resolved so to identify herself with her husbands
vanity that to gratify her wishes would be to him the most exquisite form
of selfindulgence The system might at first necessitate a resort to
some of the very shifts and expedients from which she intended it should
free her but she felt sure that in a short time she would be able to
play the game in her own way How should she have distrusted her powers
Her beauty itself was not the mere ephemeral possession it might have
been in the hands of inexperience her skill in enhancing it the care
she took of it the use she made of it seemed to give it a kind of
permanence She felt she could trust it to carry her through to the end

And the end on the whole was worthwhile Life was not the mockery she
had thought it three days ago There was room for her after all in this
crowded selfish world of pleasure whence so short a time since her
poverty had seemed to exclude her These people whom she had ridiculed
and yet envied were glad to make a place for her in the charmed circle
about which all her desires revolved They were not as brutal and
selfengrossed as she had fanciedor rather since it would no longer be
necessary to flatter and humour them that side of their nature became
less conspicuous Society is a revolving body which is apt to be judged
according to its place in each mans heaven and at present it was
turning its illuminated face to Lily

In the rosy glow it diffused her companions seemed full of amiable
qualities She liked their elegance their lightness their lack of
emphasis even the selfassurance which at times was so like obtuseness
now seemed the natural sign of social ascendency They were lords of the
only world she cared for and they were ready to admit her to their ranks
and let her lord it with them Already she felt within her a stealing
allegiance to their standards an acceptance of their limitations a
disbelief in the things they did not believe in a contemptuous pity for
the people who were not able to live as they lived

The early sunset was slanting across the park Through the boughs of the
long avenue beyond the gardens she caught the flash of wheels and
divined that more visitors were approaching There was a movement behind
her a scattering of steps and voices it was evident that the party
about the teatable was breaking up Presently she heard a tread behind
her on the terrace She supposed that Mr Gryce had at last found means
to escape from his predicament and she smiled at the significance of his
coming to join her instead of beating an instant retreat to the fireside

She turned to give him the welcome which such gallantry deserved but her
greeting wavered into a blush of wonder for the man who had approached
her was Lawrence Selden

You see I came after all he said but before she had time to answer
Mrs Dorset breaking away from a lifeless colloquy with her host had
stepped between them with a little gesture of appropriation



Chapter 5

The observance of Sunday at Bellomont was chiefly marked by the punctual
appearance of the smart omnibus destined to convey the household to the
little church at the gates Whether any one got into the omnibus or not
was a matter of secondary importance since by standing there it not only
bore witness to the orthodox intentions of the family but made Mrs
Trenor feel when she finally heard it drive away that she had somehow
vicariously made use of it

It was Mrs Trenors theory that her daughters actually did go to church
every Sunday but their French governesss convictions calling her to the
rival fane and the fatigues of the week keeping their mother in her room
till luncheon there was seldom any one present to verify the fact Now
and then in a spasmodic burst of virtuewhen the house had been too
uproarious over nightGus Trenor forced his genial bulk into a tight
frockcoat and routed his daughters from their slumbers but habitually
as Lily explained to Mr Gryce this parental duty was forgotten till the
church bells were ringing across the park and the omnibus had driven
away empty

Lily had hinted to Mr Gryce that this neglect of religious observances
was repugnant to her early traditions and that during her visits to
Bellomont she regularly accompanied Muriel and Hilda to church This
tallied with the assurance also confidentially imparted that never
having played bridge before she had been dragged into it on the night
of her arrival and had lost an appalling amount of money in consequence
of her ignorance of the game and of the rules of betting Mr Gryce was
undoubtedly enjoying Bellomont He liked the ease and glitter of the
life and the lustre conferred on him by being a member of this group of
rich and conspicuous people But he thought it a very materialistic
society there were times when he was frightened by the talk of the men
and the looks of the ladies and he was glad to find that Miss Bart for
all her ease and selfpossession was not at home in so ambiguous an
atmosphere For this reason he had been especially pleased to learn that
she would as usual attend the young Trenors to church on Sunday
morning and as he paced the gravel sweep before the door his light
overcoat on his arm and his prayerbook in one carefullygloved hand he
reflected agreeably on the strength of character which kept her true to
her early training in surroundings so subversive to religious principles

For a long time Mr Gryce and the omnibus had the gravel sweep to
themselves but far from regretting this deplorable indifference on the
part of the other guests he found himself nourishing the hope that Miss
Bart might be unaccompanied The precious minutes were flying however
the big chestnuts pawed the ground and flecked their impatient sides with
foam the coachman seemed to be slowly petrifying on the box and the
groom on the doorstep and still the lady did not come Suddenly
however there was a sound of voices and a rustle of skirts in the
doorway and Mr Gryce restoring his watch to his pocket turned with a
nervous start but it was only to find himself handing Mrs Wetherall
into the carriage

The Wetheralls always went to church They belonged to the vast group of
human automata who go through life without neglecting to perform a single
one of the gestures executed by the surrounding puppets It is true that
the Bellomont puppets did not go to church but others equally important
didand Mr and Mrs Wetheralls circle was so large that God was
included in their visitinglist They appeared therefore punctual and
resigned with the air of people bound for a dull At Home and after
them Hilda and Muriel straggled yawning and pinning each others veils
and ribbons as they came They had promised Lily to go to church with
her they declared and Lily was such a dear old duck that they didnt
mind doing it to please her though they couldnt fancy what had put the
idea in her head and though for their own part they would much rather
have played lawn tennis with Jack and Gwen if she hadnt told them she
was coming The Misses Trenor were followed by Lady Cressida Raith a
weatherbeaten person in Liberty silk and ethnological trinkets who on
seeing the omnibus expressed her surprise that they were not to walk
across the park but at Mrs Wetheralls horrified protest that the
church was a mile away her ladyship after a glance at the height of the
others heels acquiesced in the necessity of driving and poor Mr Gryce
found himself rolling off between four ladies for whose spiritual welfare
he felt not the least concern

It might have afforded him some consolation could he have known that Miss
Bart had really meant to go to church She had even risen earlier than
usual in the execution of her purpose She had an idea that the sight of
her in a grey gown of devotional cut with her famous lashes drooped
above a prayerbook would put the finishing touch to Mr Gryces
subjugation and render inevitable a certain incident which she had
resolved should form a part of the walk they were to take together after
luncheon Her intentions in short had never been more definite but poor
Lily for all the hard glaze of her exterior was inwardly as malleable
as wax Her faculty for adapting herself for entering into other
peoples feelings if it served her now and then in small contingencies
hampered her in the decisive moments of life She was like a waterplant
in the flux of the tides and today the whole current of her mood was
carrying her toward Lawrence Selden Why had he come Was it to see
herself or Bertha Dorset It was the last question which at that
moment should have engaged her She might better have contented herself
with thinking that he had simply responded to the despairing summons of
his hostess anxious to interpose him between herself and the illhumour
of Mrs Dorset But Lily had not rested till she learned from Mrs Trenor
that Selden had come of his own accord He didnt even wire mehe just
happened to find the trap at the station Perhaps its not over with
Bertha after all Mrs Trenor musingly concluded and went away to
arrange her dinnercards accordingly

Perhaps it was not Lily reflected but it should be soon unless she had
lost her cunning If Selden had come at Mrs Dorsets call it was at her
own that he would stay So much the previous evening had told her Mrs
Trenor true to her simple principle of making her married friends happy
had placed Selden and Mrs Dorset next to each other at dinner but in
obedience to the timehonoured traditions of the matchmaker she had
separated Lily and Mr Gryce sending in the former with George Dorset
while Mr Gryce was coupled with Gwen Van Osburgh

George Dorsets talk did not interfere with the range of his neighbours
thoughts He was a mournful dyspeptic intent on finding out the
deleterious ingredients of every dish and diverted from this care only by
the sound of his wifes voice On this occasion however Mrs Dorset
took no part in the general conversation She sat talking in low murmurs
with Selden and turning a contemptuous and denuded shoulder toward her
host who far from resenting his exclusion plunged into the excesses of
the MENU with the joyous irresponsibility of a free man To Mr Dorset
however his wifes attitude was a subject of such evident concern that
when he was not scraping the sauce from his fish or scooping the moist
breadcrumbs from the interior of his roll he sat straining his thin
neck for a glimpse of her between the lights

Mrs Trenor as it chanced had placed the husband and wife on opposite
sides of the table and Lily was therefore able to observe Mrs Dorset
also and by carrying her glance a few feet farther to set up a rapid
comparison between Lawrence Selden and Mr Gryce It was that comparison
which was her undoing Why else had she suddenly grown interested in
Selden She had known him for eight years or more ever since her return
to America he had formed a part of her background She had always been
glad to sit next to him at dinner had found him more agreeable than most
men and had vaguely wished that he possessed the other qualities needful
to fix her attention but till now she had been too busy with her own
affairs to regard him as more than one of the pleasant accessories of
life Miss Bart was a keen reader of her own heart and she saw that her
sudden preoccupation with Selden was due to the fact that his presence
shed a new light on her surroundings Not that he was notably brilliant
or exceptional in his own profession he was surpassed by more than one
man who had bored Lily through many a weary dinner It was rather that he
had preserved a certain social detachment a happy air of viewing the
show objectively of having points of contact outside the great gilt cage
in which they were all huddled for the mob to gape at How alluring the
world outside the cage appeared to Lily as she heard its door clang on
her In reality as she knew the door never clanged it stood always
open but most of the captives were like flies in a bottle and having
once flown in could never regain their freedom It was Seldens
distinction that he had never forgotten the way out

That was the secret of his way of readjusting her vision Lily turning
her eyes from him found herself scanning her little world through his
retina it was as though the pink lamps had been shut off and the dusty
daylight let in She looked down the long table studying its occupants
one by one from Gus Trenor with his heavy carnivorous head sunk between
his shoulders as he preyed on a jellied plover to his wife at the
opposite end of the long bank of orchids suggestive with her glaring
goodlooks of a jewellers window lit by electricity And between the
two what a long stretch of vacuity How dreary and trivial these people
were Lily reviewed them with a scornful impatience Carry Fisher with
her shoulders her eyes her divorces her general air of embodying a
spicy paragraph young Silverton who had meant to live on
proofreading and write an epic and who now lived on his friends and had
become critical of truffles Alice Wetherall an animated visitinglist
whose most fervid convictions turned on the wording of invitations and
the engraving of dinnercards Wetherall with his perpetual nervous nod
of acquiescence his air of agreeing with people before he knew what they
were saying Jack Stepney with his confident smile and anxious eyes
half way between the sheriff and an heiress Gwen Van Osburgh with all
the guileless confidence of a young girl who has always been told that
there is no one richer than her father

Lily smiled at her classification of her friends How different they had
seemed to her a few hours ago Then they had symbolized what she was
gaining now they stood for what she was giving up That very afternoon
they had seemed full of brilliant qualities now she saw that they were
merely dull in a loud way Under the glitter of their opportunities she
saw the poverty of their achievement It was not that she wanted them to
be more disinterested but she would have liked them to be more
picturesque And she had a shamed recollection of the way in which a few
hours since she had felt the centripetal force of their standards She
closed her eyes an instant and the vacuous routine of the life she had
chosen stretched before her like a long white road without dip or
turning it was true she was to roll over it in a carriage instead of
trudging it on foot but sometimes the pedestrian enjoys the diversion of
a short cut which is denied to those on wheels

She was roused by a chuckle which Mr Dorset seemed to eject from the
depths of his lean throat

I say do look at her he exclaimed turning to Miss Bart with
lugubrious merrimentI beg your pardon but do just look at my wife
making a fool of that poor devil over there One would really suppose she
was gone on himand its all the other way round I assure you

Thus adjured Lily turned her eyes on the spectacle which was affording
Mr Dorset such legitimate mirth It certainly appeared as he said that
Mrs Dorset was the more active participant in the scene her neighbour
seemed to receive her advances with a temperate zest which did not
distract him from his dinner The sight restored Lilys good humour and
knowing the peculiar disguise which Mr Dorsets marital fears assumed
she asked gaily Arent you horribly jealous of her

Dorset greeted the sally with delight Oh abominablyyouve just hit
itkeeps me awake at night The doctors tell me thats what has knocked
my digestion outbeing so infernally jealous of herI cant eat a
mouthful of this stuff you know he added suddenly pushing back his
plate with a clouded countenance and Lily unfailingly adaptable
accorded her radiant attention to his prolonged denunciation of other
peoples cooks with a supplementary tirade on the toxic qualities of
melted butter

It was not often that he found so ready an ear and being a man as well
as a dyspeptic it may be that as he poured his grievances into it he was
not insensible to its rosy symmetry At any rate he engaged Lily so long
that the sweets were being handed when she caught a phrase on her other
side where Miss Corby the comic woman of the company was bantering
Jack Stepney on his approaching engagement Miss Corbys role was
jocularity she always entered the conversation with a handspring

And of course youll have Sim Rosedale as best man Lily heard her
fling out as the climax of her prognostications and Stepney responded
as if struck Jove thats an idea What a thumping present Id get out
of him

SIM ROSEDALE The name made more odious by its diminutive obtruded
itself on Lilys thoughts like a leer It stood for one of the many hated
possibilities hovering on the edge of life If she did not marry Percy
Gryce the day might come when she would have to be civil to such men as
Rosedale IF SHE DID NOT MARRY HIM But she meant to marry himshe was
sure of him and sure of herself She drew back with a shiver from the
pleasant paths in which her thoughts had been straying and set her feet
once more in the middle of the long white road When she went
upstairs that night she found that the late post had brought her a fresh
batch of bills Mrs Peniston who was a conscientious woman had
forwarded them all to Bellomont

Miss Bart accordingly rose the next morning with the most earnest
conviction that it was her duty to go to church She tore herself betimes
from the lingering enjoyment of her breakfasttray rang to have her grey
gown laid out and despatched her maid to borrow a prayerbook from Mrs
Trenor

But her course was too purely reasonable not to contain the germs of
rebellion No sooner were her preparations made than they roused a
smothered sense of resistance A small spark was enough to kindle Lilys
imagination and the sight of the grey dress and the borrowed prayerbook
flashed a long light down the years She would have to go to church with
Percy Gryce every Sunday They would have a front pew in the most
expensive church in New York and his name would figure handsomely in the
list of parish charities In a few years when he grew stouter he would
be made a warden Once in the winter the rector would come to dine and
her husband would beg her to go over the list and see that no DIVORCEES
were included except those who had showed signs of penitence by being
remarried to the very wealthy There was nothing especially arduous in
this round of religious obligations but it stood for a fraction of that
great bulk of boredom which loomed across her path And who could consent
to be bored on such a morning Lily had slept well and her bath had
filled her with a pleasant glow which was becomingly reflected in the
clear curve of her cheek No lines were visible this morning or else the
glass was at a happier angle

And the day was the accomplice of her mood it was a day for impulse and
truancy The light air seemed full of powdered gold below the dewy bloom
of the lawns the woodlands blushed and smouldered and the hills across
the river swam in molten blue Every drop of blood in Lilys veins
invited her to happiness

The sound of wheels roused her from these musings and leaning behind her
shutters she saw the omnibus take up its freight She was too late
thenbut the fact did not alarm her A glimpse of Mr Gryces
crestfallen face even suggested that she had done wisely in absenting
herself since the disappointment he so candidly betrayed would surely
whet his appetite for the afternoon walk That walk she did not mean to
miss one glance at the bills on her writingtable was enough to recall
its necessity But meanwhile she had the morning to herself and could
muse pleasantly on the disposal of its hours She was familiar enough
with the habits of Bellomont to know that she was likely to have a free
field till luncheon She had seen the Wetheralls the Trenor girls and
Lady Cressida packed safely into the omnibus Judy Trenor was sure to be
having her hair shampooed Carry Fisher had doubtless carried off her
host for a drive Ned Silverton was probably smoking the cigarette of
young despair in his bedroom and Kate Corby was certain to be playing
tennis with Jack Stepney and Miss Van Osburgh Of the ladies this left
only Mrs Dorset unaccounted for and Mrs Dorset never came down till
luncheon her doctors she averred had forbidden her to expose herself
to the crude air of the morning

To the remaining members of the party Lily gave no special thought
wherever they were they were not likely to interfere with her plans
These for the moment took the shape of assuming a dress somewhat more
rustic and summerlike in style than the garment she had first selected
and rustling downstairs sunshade in hand with the disengaged air of a
lady in quest of exercise The great hall was empty but for the knot of
dogs by the fire who taking in at a glance the outdoor aspect of Miss
Bart were upon her at once with lavish offers of companionship She put
aside the ramming paws which conveyed these offers and assuring the
joyous volunteers that she might presently have a use for their company
sauntered on through the empty drawingroom to the library at the end of
the house The library was almost the only surviving portion of the old
manorhouse of Bellomont a long spacious room revealing the traditions
of the mothercountry in its classicallycased doors the Dutch tiles of
the chimney and the elaborate hobgrate with its shining brass urns A
few family portraits of lanternjawed gentlemen in tiewigs and ladies
with large headdresses and small bodies hung between the shelves lined
with pleasantlyshabby books books mostly contemporaneous with the
ancestors in question and to which the subsequent Trenors had made no
perceptible additions The library at Bellomont was in fact never used
for reading though it had a certain popularity as a smokingroom or a
quiet retreat for flirtation It had occurred to Lily however that it
might on this occasion have been resorted to by the only member of the
party in the least likely to put it to its original use She advanced
noiselessly over the dense old rug scattered with easychairs and before
she reached the middle of the room she saw that she had not been
mistaken Lawrence Selden was in fact seated at its farther end but
though a book lay on his knee his attention was not engaged with it but
directed to a lady whose laceclad figure as she leaned back in an
adjoining chair detached itself with exaggerated slimness against the
dusky leather upholstery

Lily paused as she caught sight of the group for a moment she seemed
about to withdraw but thinking better of this she announced her
approach by a slight shake of her skirts which made the couple raise
their heads Mrs Dorset with a look of frank displeasure and Selden
with his usual quiet smile The sight of his composure had a disturbing
effect on Lily but to be disturbed was in her case to make a more
brilliant effort at selfpossession

Dear me am I late she asked putting a hand in his as he advanced to
greet her

Late for what enquired Mrs Dorset tartly Not for luncheon
certainlybut perhaps you had an earlier engagement

Yes I had said Lily confidingly

Really Perhaps I am in the way then But Mr Selden is entirely at
your disposal Mrs Dorset was pale with temper and her antagonist felt
a certain pleasure in prolonging her distress

Oh dear nodo stay she said goodhumouredly I dont in the least
want to drive you away

Youre awfully good dear but I never interfere with Mr Seldens
engagements

The remark was uttered with a little air of proprietorship not lost on
its object who concealed a faint blush of annoyance by stooping to pick
up the book he had dropped at Lilys approach The latters eyes widened
charmingly and she broke into a light laugh

But I have no engagement with Mr Selden My engagement was to go to
church and Im afraid the omnibus has started without me HAS it
started do you know

She turned to Selden who replied that he had heard it drive away some
time since

Ah then I shall have to walk I promised Hilda and Muriel to go to
church with them Its too late to walk there you say Well I shall
have the credit of trying at any rateand the advantage of escaping
part of the service Im not so sorry for myself after all

And with a bright nod to the couple on whom she had intruded Miss Bart
strolled through the glass doors and carried her rustling grace down the
long perspective of the garden walk

She was taking her way churchward but at no very quick pace a fact not
lost on one of her observers who stood in the doorway looking after her
with an air of puzzled amusement The truth is that she was conscious of
a somewhat keen shock of disappointment All her plans for the day had
been built on the assumption that it was to see her that Selden had come
to Bellomont She had expected when she came downstairs to find him on
the watch for her and she had found him instead in a situation which
might well denote that he had been on the watch for another lady Was it
possible after all that he had come for Bertha Dorset The latter had
acted on the assumption to the extent of appearing at an hour when she
never showed herself to ordinary mortals and Lily for the moment saw
no way of putting her in the wrong It did not occur to her that Selden
might have been actuated merely by the desire to spend a Sunday out of
town women never learn to dispense with the sentimental motive in their
judgments of men But Lily was not easily disconcerted competition put
her on her mettle and she reflected that Seldens coming if it did not
declare him to be still in Mrs Dorsets toils showed him to be so
completely free from them that he was not afraid of her proximity

These thoughts so engaged her that she fell into a gait hardly likely to
carry her to church before the sermon and at length having passed from
the gardens to the woodpath beyond so far forgot her intention as to
sink into a rustic seat at a bend of the walk The spot was charming and
Lily was not insensible to the charm or to the fact that her presence
enhanced it but she was not accustomed to taste the joys of solitude
except in company and the combination of a handsome girl and a romantic
scene struck her as too good to be wasted No one however appeared to
profit by the opportunity and after a half hour of fruitless waiting she
rose and wandered on She felt a stealing sense of fatigue as she walked
the sparkle had died out of her and the taste of life was stale on her
lips She hardly knew what she had been seeking or why the failure to
find it had so blotted the light from her sky she was only aware of a
vague sense of failure of an inner isolation deeper than the loneliness
about her

Her footsteps flagged and she stood gazing listlessly ahead digging the
ferny edge of the path with the tip of her sunshade As she did so a
step sounded behind her and she saw Selden at her side

How fast you walk he remarked I thought I should never catch up with
you

She answered gaily You must be quite breathless Ive been sitting
under that tree for an hour

Waiting for me I hope he rejoined and she said with a vague laugh

Wellwaiting to see if you would come

I seize the distinction but I dont mind it since doing the one
involved doing the other But werent you sure that I should come

If I waited long enoughbut you see I had only a limited time to give
to the experiment

Why limited Limited by luncheon

No by my other engagement

Your engagement to go to church with Muriel and Hilda

No but to come home from church with another person

Ah I see I might have known you were fully provided with alternatives
And is the other person coming home this way

Lily laughed again Thats just what I dont know and to find out it
is my business to get to church before the service is over

Exactly and it is my business to prevent your doing so in which case
the other person piqued by your absence will form the desperate resolve
of driving back in the omnibus

Lily received this with fresh appreciation his nonsense was like the
bubbling of her inner mood Is that what you would do in such an
emergency she enquired

Selden looked at her with solemnity I am here to prove to you he
cried what I am capable of doing in an emergency

Walking a mile in an houryou must own that the omnibus would be
quicker

Ahbut will he find you in the end Thats the only test of success

They looked at each other with the same luxury of enjoyment that they had
felt in exchanging absurdities over his teatable but suddenly Lilys
face changed and she said Well if it is he has succeeded

Selden following her glance perceived a party of people advancing
toward them from the farther bend of the path Lady Cressida had
evidently insisted on walking home and the rest of the churchgoers had
thought it their duty to accompany her Lilys companion looked rapidly
from one to the other of the two men of the party Wetherall walking
respectfully at Lady Cressidas side with his little sidelong look of
nervous attention and Percy Gryce bringing up the rear with Mrs
Wetherall and the Trenors

Ahnow I see why you were getting up your Americana Selden exclaimed
with a note of the freest admiration but the blush with which the sally
was received checked whatever amplifications he had meant to give it

That Lily Bart should object to being bantered about her suitors or even
about her means of attracting them was so new to Selden that he had a
momentary flash of surprise which lit up a number of possibilities but
she rose gallantly to the defence of her confusion by saying as its
object approached That was why I was waiting for youto thank you for
having given me so many points

Ah you can hardly do justice to the subject in such a short time said
Selden as the Trenor girls caught sight of Miss Bart and while she
signalled a response to their boisterous greeting he added quickly
Wont you devote your afternoon to it You know I must be off tomorrow
morning Well take a walk and you can thank me at your leisure



Chapter 6

The afternoon was perfect A deeper stillness possessed the air and the
glitter of the American autumn was tempered by a haze which diffused the
brightness without dulling it

In the woody hollows of the park there was already a faint chill but as
the ground rose the air grew lighter and ascending the long slopes
beyond the highroad Lily and her companion reached a zone of lingering
summer The path wound across a meadow with scattered trees then it
dipped into a lane plumed with asters and purpling sprays of bramble
whence through the light quiver of ashleaves the country unrolled
itself in pastoral distances

Higher up the lane showed thickening tufts of fern and of the creeping
glossy verdure of shaded slopes trees began to overhang it and the
shade deepened to the checkered dusk of a beechgrove The boles of the
trees stood well apart with only a light feathering of undergrowth the
path wound along the edge of the wood now and then looking out on a
sunlit pasture or on an orchard spangled with fruit

Lily had no real intimacy with nature but she had a passion for the
appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the
fitting background of her own sensations The landscape outspread below
her seemed an enlargement of her present mood and she found something of
herself in its calmness its breadth its long free reaches On the
nearer slopes the sugarmaples wavered like pyres of light lower down
was a massing of grey orchards and here and there the lingering green of
an oakgrove Two or three red farmhouses dozed under the appletrees
and the white wooden spire of a village church showed beyond the shoulder
of the hill while far below in a haze of dust the highroad ran
between the fields

Let us sit here Selden suggested as they reached an open ledge of
rock above which the beeches rose steeply between mossy boulders

Lily dropped down on the rock glowing with her long climb She sat
quiet her lips parted by the stress of the ascent her eyes wandering
peacefully over the broken ranges of the landscape Selden stretched
himself on the grass at her feet tilting his hat against the level
sunrays and clasping his hands behind his head which rested against
the side of the rock He had no wish to make her talk her
quickbreathing silence seemed a part of the general hush and harmony of
things In his own mind there was only a lazy sense of pleasure veiling
the sharp edges of sensation as the September haze veiled the scene at
their feet But Lily though her attitude was as calm as his was
throbbing inwardly with a rush of thoughts There were in her at the
moment two beings one drawing deep breaths of freedom and exhilaration
the other gasping for air in a little black prisonhouse of fears But
gradually the captives gasps grew fainter or the other paid less heed
to them the horizon expanded the air grew stronger and the free spirit
quivered for flight

She could not herself have explained the sense of buoyancy which seemed
to lift and swing her above the sunsuffused world at her feet Was it
love she wondered or a mere fortuitous combination of happy thoughts
and sensations How much of it was owing to the spell of the perfect
afternoon the scent of the fading woods the thought of the dulness she
had fled from Lily had no definite experience by which to test the
quality of her feelings She had several times been in love with
fortunes or careers but only once with a man That was years ago when
she first came out and had been smitten with a romantic passion for a
young gentleman named Herbert Melson who had blue eyes and a little wave
in his hair Mr Melson who was possessed of no other negotiable
securities had hastened to employ these in capturing the eldest Miss Van
Osburgh since then he had grown stout and wheezy and was given to
telling anecdotes about his children If Lily recalled this early emotion
it was not to compare it with that which now possessed her the only
point of comparison was the sense of lightness of emancipation which
she remembered feeling in the whirl of a waltz or the seclusion of a
conservatory during the brief course of her youthful romance She had
not known again till today that lightness that glow of freedom but now
it was something more than a blind groping of the blood The peculiar
charm of her feeling for Selden was that she understood it she could put
her finger on every link of the chain that was drawing them together
Though his popularity was of the quiet kind felt rather than actively
expressed among his friends she had never mistaken his inconspicuousness
for obscurity His reputed cultivation was generally regarded as a slight
obstacle to easy intercourse but Lily who prided herself on her
broadminded recognition of literature and always carried an Omar Khayam
in her travellingbag was attracted by this attribute which she felt
would have had its distinction in an older society It was moreover one
of his gifts to look his part to have a height which lifted his head
above the crowd and the keenlymodelled dark features which in a land
of amorphous types gave him the air of belonging to a more specialized
race of carrying the impress of a concentrated past Expansive persons
found him a little dry and very young girls thought him sarcastic but
this air of friendly aloofness as far removed as possible from any
assertion of personal advantage was the quality which piqued Lilys
interest Everything about him accorded with the fastidious element in
her taste even to the light irony with which he surveyed what seemed to
her most sacred She admired him most of all perhaps for being able to
convey as distinct a sense of superiority as the richest man she had ever
met

It was the unconscious prolongation of this thought which led her to say
presently with a laugh I have broken two engagements for you today
How many have you broken for me

None said Selden calmly My only engagement at Bellomont was with
you

She glanced down at him faintly smiling

Did you really come to Bellomont to see me

Of course I did

Her look deepened meditatively Why she murmured with an accent which
took all tinge of coquetry from the question

Because youre such a wonderful spectacle I always like to see what you
are doing

How do you know what I should be doing if you were not here

Selden smiled I dont flatter myself that my coming has deflected your
course of action by a hairs breadth

Thats absurdsince if you were not here I could obviously not be
taking a walk with you

No but your taking a walk with me is only another way of making use of
your material You are an artist and I happen to be the bit of colour you
are using today Its a part of your cleverness to be able to produce
premeditated effects extemporaneously

Lily smiled also his words were too acute not to strike her sense of
humour It was true that she meant to use the accident of his presence as
part of a very definite effect or that at least was the secret pretext
she had found for breaking her promise to walk with Mr Gryce She had
sometimes been accused of being too eagereven Judy Trenor had warned
her to go slowly Well she would not be too eager in this case she
would give her suitor a longer taste of suspense Where duty and
inclination jumped together it was not in Lilys nature to hold them
asunder She had excused herself from the walk on the plea of a headache
the horrid headache which in the morning had prevented her venturing to
church Her appearance at luncheon justified the excuse She looked
languid full of a suffering sweetness she carried a scentbottle in her
hand Mr Gryce was new to such manifestations he wondered rather
nervously if she were delicate having farreaching fears about the
future of his progeny But sympathy won the day and he besought her not
to expose herself he always connected the outer air with ideas of
exposure

Lily had received his sympathy with languid gratitude urging him since
she should be such poor company to join the rest of the party who after
luncheon were starting in automobiles on a visit to the Van Osburghs at
Peekskill Mr Gryce was touched by her disinterestedness and to escape
from the threatened vacuity of the afternoon had taken her advice and
departed mournfully in a dusthood and goggles as the motorcar plunged
down the avenue she smiled at his resemblance to a baffled beetle Selden
had watched her manoeuvres with lazy amusement She had made no reply to
his suggestion that they should spend the afternoon together but as her
plan unfolded itself he felt fairly confident of being included in it
The house was empty when at length he heard her step on the stair and
strolled out of the billiardroom to join her

She had on a hat and walkingdress and the dogs were bounding at her
feet

I thought after all the air might do me good she explained and he
agreed that so simple a remedy was worth trying

The excursionists would be gone at least four hours Lily and Selden had
the whole afternoon before them and the sense of leisure and safety gave
the last touch of lightness to her spirit With so much time to talk and
no definite object to be led up to she could taste the rare joys of
mental vagrancy

She felt so free from ulterior motives that she took up his charge with a
touch of resentment

I dont know she said why you are always accusing me of
premeditation

I thought you confessed to it you told me the other day that you had to
follow a certain lineand if one does a thing at all it is a merit to do
it thoroughly

If you mean that a girl who has no one to think for her is obliged to
think for herself I am quite willing to accept the imputation But you
must find me a dismal kind of person if you suppose that I never yield to
an impulse

Ah but I dont suppose that havent I told you that your genius lies
in converting impulses into intentions

My genius she echoed with a sudden note of weariness Is there any
final test of genius but success And I certainly havent succeeded

Selden pushed his hat back and took a sideglance at her Successwhat
is success I shall be interested to have your definition

Success She hesitated Why to get as much as one can out of life I
suppose Its a relative quality after all Isnt that your idea of it

My idea of it God forbid He sat up with sudden energy resting his
elbows on his knees and staring out upon the mellow fields My idea of
success he said is personal freedom

Freedom Freedom from worries

From everythingfrom money from poverty from ease and anxiety from
all the material accidents To keep a kind of republic of the
spiritthats what I call success

She leaned forward with a responsive flash I knowI knowits
strange but thats just what Ive been feeling today

He met her eyes with the latent sweetness of his Is the feeling so rare
with you he said

She blushed a little under his gaze You think me horribly sordid dont
you But perhaps its rather that I never had any choice There was no
one I mean to tell me about the republic of the spirit

There never isits a country one has to find the way to ones self

But I should never have found my way there if you hadnt told me

Ah there are signpostsbut one has to know how to read them

Well I have known I have known she cried with a glow of eagerness
Whenever I see you I find myself spelling out a letter of the signand
yesterdaylast evening at dinnerI suddenly saw a little way into your
republic

Selden was still looking at her but with a changed eye Hitherto he had
found in her presence and her talk the aesthetic amusement which a
reflective man is apt to seek in desultory intercourse with pretty women
His attitude had been one of admiring spectatorship and he would have
been almost sorry to detect in her any emotional weakness which should
interfere with the fulfilment of her aims But now the hint of this
weakness had become the most interesting thing about her He had come on
her that morning in a moment of disarray her face had been pale and
altered and the diminution of her beauty had lent her a poignant charm
THAT IS HOW SHE LOOKS WHEN SHE IS ALONE had been his first thought and
the second was to note in her the change which his coming produced It
was the dangerpoint of their intercourse that he could not doubt the
spontaneity of her liking From whatever angle he viewed their dawning
intimacy he could not see it as part of her scheme of life and to be
the unforeseen element in a career so accurately planned was stimulating
even to a man who had renounced sentimental experiments

Well he said did it make you want to see more Are you going to
become one of us

He had drawn out his cigarettes as he spoke and she reached her hand
toward the case

Oh do give me oneI havent smoked for days

Why such unnatural abstinence Everybody smokes at Bellomont

Yesbut it is not considered becoming in a JEUNE FILLE A MARIER and at
the present moment I am a JEUNE FILLE A MARIER

Ah then Im afraid we cant let you into the republic

Why not Is it a celibate order

Not in the least though Im bound to say there are not many married
people in it But you will marry some one very rich and its as hard for
rich people to get into as the kingdom of heaven

Thats unjust I think because as I understand it one of the
conditions of citizenship is not to think too much about money and the
only way not to think about money is to have a great deal of it

You might as well say that the only way not to think about air is to
have enough to breathe That is true enough in a sense but your lungs
are thinking about the air if you are not And so it is with your rich
peoplethey may not be thinking of money but theyre breathing it all
the while take them into another element and see how they squirm and
gasp

Lily sat gazing absently through the blue rings of her cigarettesmoke

It seems to me she said at length that you spend a good deal of your
time in the element you disapprove of

Selden received this thrust without discomposure Yes but I have tried
to remain amphibious its all right as long as ones lungs can work in
another air The real alchemy consists in being able to turn gold back
again into something else and thats the secret that most of your
friends have lost

Lily mused Dont you think she rejoined after a moment that the
people who find fault with society are too apt to regard it as an end and
not a means just as the people who despise money speak as if its only
use were to be kept in bags and gloated over Isnt it fairer to look at
them both as opportunities which may be used either stupidly or
intelligently according to the capacity of the user

That is certainly the sane view but the queer thing about society is
that the people who regard it as an end are those who are in it and not
the critics on the fence Its just the other way with most showsthe
audience may be under the illusion but the actors know that real life is
on the other side of the footlights The people who take society as an
escape from work are putting it to its proper use but when it becomes
the thing worked for it distorts all the relations of life Selden
raised himself on his elbow Good heavens he went on I dont
underrate the decorative side of life It seems to me the sense of
splendour has justified itself by what it has produced The worst of it
is that so much human nature is used up in the process If were all the
raw stuff of the cosmic effects one would rather be the fire that
tempers a sword than the fish that dyes a purple cloak And a society
like ours wastes such good material in producing its little patch of
purple Look at a boy like Ned Silvertonhes really too good to be used
to refurbish anybodys social shabbiness Theres a lad just setting out
to discover the universe isnt it a pity he should end by finding it in
Mrs Fishers drawingroom

Ned is a dear boy and I hope he will keep his illusions long enough to
write some nice poetry about them but do you think it is only in society
that he is likely to lose them

Selden answered her with a shrug Why do we call all our generous ideas
illusions and the mean ones truths Isnt it a sufficient condemnation
of society to find ones self accepting such phraseology I very nearly
acquired the jargon at Silvertons age and I know how names can alter
the colour of beliefs

She had never heard him speak with such energy of affirmation His
habitual touch was that of the eclectic who lightly turns over and
compares and she was moved by this sudden glimpse into the laboratory
where his faiths were formed

Ah you are as bad as the other sectarians she exclaimed why do you
call your republic a republic It is a closed corporation and you create
arbitrary objections in order to keep people out

It is not MY republic if it were I should have a COUP DETAT and seat
you on the throne

Whereas in reality you think I can never even get my foot across the
threshold Oh I understand what you mean You despise my ambitionsyou
think them unworthy of me

Selden smiled but not ironically Well isnt that a tribute I think
them quite worthy of most of the people who live by them

She had turned to gaze on him gravely But isnt it possible that if I
had the opportunities of these people I might make a better use of them
Money stands for all kinds of thingsits purchasing quality isnt
limited to diamonds and motorcars


Not in the least you might expiate your enjoyment of them by founding a
hospital

But if you think they are what I should really enjoy you must think my
ambitions are good enough for me

Selden met this appeal with a laugh Ah my dear Miss Bart I am not
divine Providence to guarantee your enjoying the things you are trying
to get

Then the best you can say for me is that after struggling to get them I
probably shant like them She drew a deep breath What a miserable
future you foresee for me

Wellhave you never foreseen it for yourself The slow colour rose to
her cheek not a blush of excitement but drawn from the deep wells of
feeling it was as if the effort of her spirit had produced it

Often and often she said But it looks so much darker when you show
it to me

He made no answer to this exclamation and for a while they sat silent
while something throbbed between them in the wide quiet of the air

But suddenly she turned on him with a kind of vehemence Why do you do
this to me she cried Why do you make the things I have chosen seem
hateful to me if you have nothing to give me instead

The words roused Selden from the musing fit into which he had fallen He
himself did not know why he had led their talk along such lines it was
the last use he would have imagined himself making of an afternoons
solitude with Miss Bart But it was one of those moments when neither
seemed to speak deliberately when an indwelling voice in each called to
the other across unsounded depths of feeling

No I have nothing to give you instead he said sitting up and turning
so that he faced her If I had it should be yours you know

She received this abrupt declaration in a way even stranger than the
manner of its making she dropped her face on her hands and he saw that
for a moment she wept

It was for a moment only however for when he leaned nearer and drew
down her hands with a gesture less passionate than grave she turned on
him a face softened but not disfigured by emotion and he said to
himself somewhat cruelly that even her weeping was an art

The reflection steadied his voice as he asked between pity and irony
Isnt it natural that I should try to belittle all the things I cant
offer you

Her face brightened at this but she drew her hand away not with a
gesture of coquetry but as though renouncing something to which she had
no claim

But you belittle ME dont you she returned gently in being so sure
they are the only things I care for

Selden felt an inner start but it was only the last quiver of his
egoism Almost at once he answered quite simply But you do care for
them dont you And no wishing of mine can alter that

He had so completely ceased to consider how far this might carry him
that he had a distinct sense of disappointment when she turned on him a
face sparkling with derision

Ah she cried for all your fine phrases youre really as great a
coward as I am for you wouldnt have made one of them if you hadnt been
so sure of my answer

The shock of this retort had the effect of crystallizing Seldens
wavering intentions

I am not so sure of your answer he said quietly And I do you the
justice to believe that you are not either

It was her turn to look at him with surprise and after a momentDo you
want to marry me she asked

He broke into a laugh No I dont want tobut perhaps I should if you
did

Thats what I told youyoure so sure of me that you can amuse yourself
with experiments She drew back the hand he had regained and sat
looking down on him sadly

I am not making experiments he returned Or if I am it is not on you
but on myself I dont know what effect they are going to have on mebut
if marrying you is one of them I will take the risk

She smiled faintly It would be a great risk certainlyI have never
concealed from you how great

Ah its you who are the coward he exclaimed

She had risen and he stood facing her with his eyes on hers The soft
isolation of the falling day enveloped them they seemed lifted into a
finer air All the exquisite influences of the hour trembled in their
veins and drew them to each other as the loosened leaves were drawn to
the earth

Its you who are the coward he repeated catching her hands in his

She leaned on him for a moment as if with a drop of tired wings he felt
as though her heart were beating rather with the stress of a long flight
than the thrill of new distances Then drawing back with a little smile
of warningI shall look hideous in dowdy clothes but I can trim my own
hats she declared

They stood silent for a while after this smiling at each other like
adventurous children who have climbed to a forbidden height from which
they discover a new world The actual world at their feet was veiling
itself in dimness and across the valley a clear moon rose in the denser
blue

Suddenly they heard a remote sound like the hum of a giant insect and
following the highroad which wound whiter through the surrounding
twilight a black object rushed across their vision

Lily started from her attitude of absorption her smile faded and she
began to move toward the lane

I had no idea it was so late We shall not be back till after dark she
said almost impatiently

Selden was looking at her with surprise it took him a moment to regain
his usual view of her then he said with an uncontrollable note of
dryness That was not one of our party the motor was going the other
way

I knowI know She paused and he saw her redden through the
twilight But I told them I was not wellthat I should not go out Let
us go down she murmured

Selden continued to look at her then he drew his cigarettecase from his
pocket and slowly lit a cigarette It seemed to him necessary at that
moment to proclaim by some habitual gesture of this sort his recovered
hold on the actual he had an almost puerile wish to let his companion
see that their flight over he had landed on his feet

She waited while the spark flickered under his curved palm then he held
out the cigarettes to her

She took one with an unsteady hand and putting it to her lips leaned
forward to draw her light from his In the indistinctness the little red
gleam lit up the lower part of her face and he saw her mouth tremble
into a smile

Were you serious she asked with an odd thrill of gaiety which she
might have caught up in haste from a heap of stock inflections without
having time to select the just note Seldens voice was under better
control Why not he returned You see I took no risks in being so
And as she continued to stand before him a little pale under the retort
he added quickly Let us go down



Chapter 7

It spoke much for the depth of Mrs Trenors friendship that her voice
in admonishing Miss Bart took the same note of personal despair as if
she had been lamenting the collapse of a houseparty

All I can say is Lily that I cant make you out She leaned back
sighing in the morning abandon of lace and muslin turning an
indifferent shoulder to the heapedup importunities of her desk while
she considered with the eye of a physician who has given up the case
the erect exterior of the patient confronting her

If you hadnt told me you were going in for him seriouslybut Im sure
you made that plain enough from the beginning Why else did you ask me to
let you off bridge and to keep away Carry and Kate Corby I dont
suppose you did it because he amused you we could none of us imagine
your putting up with him for a moment unless you meant to marry him And
Im sure everybody played fair They all wanted to help it along Even
Bertha kept her hands offI will say thattill Lawrence came down and
you dragged him away from her After that she had a right to
retaliatewhy on earth did you interfere with her Youve known Lawrence
Selden for yearswhy did you behave as if you had just discovered him
If you had a grudge against Bertha it was a stupid time to show ityou
could have paid her back just as well after you were married I told you
Bertha was dangerous She was in an odious mood when she came here but
Lawrences turning up put her in a good humour and if youd only let her
think he came for HER it would have never occurred to her to play you
this trick Oh Lily youll never do anything if youre not serious

Miss Bart accepted this exhortation in a spirit of the purest
impartiality Why should she have been angry It was the voice of her own
conscience which spoke to her through Mrs Trenors reproachful accents
But even to her own conscience she must trump up a semblance of defence
I only took a day offI thought he meant to stay on all this week and
I knew Mr Selden was leaving this morning

Mrs Trenor brushed aside the plea with a gesture which laid bare its
weakness

He did mean to staythats the worst of it It shows that hes run away
from you that Berthas done her work and poisoned him thoroughly

Lily gave a slight laugh Oh if hes running Ill overtake him

Her friend threw out an arresting hand Whatever you do Lily do
nothing

Miss Bart received the warning with a smile I dont mean literally to
take the next train There are ways But she did not go on to specify
them

Mrs Trenor sharply corrected the tense There WERE waysplenty of
them I didnt suppose you needed to have them pointed out But dont
deceive yourselfhes thoroughly frightened He has run straight home to
his mother and shell protect him

Oh to the death Lily agreed dimpling at the vision

How you can LAUGH her friend rebuked her and she dropped back to a
soberer perception of things with the question What was it Bertha
really told him

Dont ask mehorrors She seemed to have raked up everything Oh you
know what I meanof course there isnt anything REALLY but I suppose
she brought in Prince Variglianoand Lord Hubertand there was some
story of your having borrowed money of old Ned Van Alstyne did you ever

He is my fathers cousin Miss Bart interposed

Well of course she left THAT out It seems Ned told Carry Fisher and
she told Bertha naturally Theyre all alike you know they hold their
tongues for years and you think youre safe but when their opportunity
comes they remember everything

Lily had grown pale her voice had a harsh note in it It was some money
I lost at bridge at the Van Osburghs I repaid it of course

Ah well they wouldnt remember that besides it was the idea of the
gambling debt that frightened Percy Oh Bertha knew her manshe knew
just what to tell him

In this strain Mrs Trenor continued for nearly an hour to admonish her
friend Miss Bart listened with admirable equanimity Her naturally good
temper had been disciplined by years of enforced compliance since she
had almost always had to attain her ends by the circuitous path of other
peoples and being naturally inclined to face unpleasant facts as soon
as they presented themselves she was not sorry to hear an impartial
statement of what her folly was likely to cost the more so as her own
thoughts were still insisting on the other side of the case Presented
in the light of Mrs Trenors vigorous comments the reckoning was
certainly a formidable one and Lily as she listened found herself
gradually reverting to her friends view of the situation Mrs Trenors
words were moreover emphasized for her hearer by anxieties which she
herself could scarcely guess Affluence unless stimulated by a keen
imagination forms but the vaguest notion of the practical strain of
poverty Judy knew it must be horrid for poor Lily to have to stop to
consider whether she could afford real lace on her petticoats and not to
have a motorcar and a steamyacht at her orders but the daily friction
of unpaid bills the daily nibble of small temptations to expenditure
were trials as far out of her experience as the domestic problems of the
charwoman Mrs Trenors unconsciousness of the real stress of the
situation had the effect of making it more galling to Lily While her
friend reproached her for missing the opportunity to eclipse her rivals
she was once more battling in imagination with the mounting tide of
indebtedness from which she had so nearly escaped What wind of folly had
driven her out again on those dark seas

If anything was needed to put the last touch to her selfabasement it was
the sense of the way her old life was opening its ruts again to receive
her Yesterday her fancy had fluttered free pinions above a choice of
occupations now she had to drop to the level of the familiar routine in
which moments of seeming brilliancy and freedom alternated with long
hours of subjection

She laid a deprecating hand on her friends Dear Judy Im sorry to
have been such a bore and you are very good to me But you must have
some letters for me to answerlet me at least be useful

She settled herself at the desk and Mrs Trenor accepted her resumption
of the mornings task with a sigh which implied that after all she had
proved herself unfit for higher uses

The luncheon table showed a depleted circle All the men but Jack Stepney
and Dorset had returned to town it seemed to Lily a last touch of irony
that Selden and Percy Gryce should have gone in the same train and Lady
Cressida and the attendant Wetheralls had been despatched by motor to
lunch at a distant countryhouse At such moments of diminished interest
it was usual for Mrs Dorset to keep her room till the afternoon but on
this occasion she drifted in when luncheon was half over hollowedeyed
and drooping but with an edge of malice under her indifference

She raised her eyebrows as she looked about the table How few of us are
left I do so enjoy the quietdont you Lily I wish the men would
always stop awayits really much nicer without them Oh you dont
count George one doesnt have to talk to ones husband But I thought
Mr Gryce was to stay for the rest of the week she added enquiringly
Didnt he intend to Judy Hes such a nice boyI wonder what drove
him away He is rather shy and Im afraid we may have shocked him he
has been brought up in such an oldfashioned way Do you know Lily he
told me he had never seen a girl play cards for money till he saw you
doing it the other night And he lives on the interest of his income and
always has a lot left over to invest

Mrs Fisher leaned forward eagerly I do believe it is some ones duty
to educate that young man It is shocking that he has never been made to
realize his duties as a citizen Every wealthy man should be compelled to
study the laws of his country

Mrs Dorset glanced at her quietly I think he HAS studied the divorce
laws He told me he had promised the Bishop to sign some kind of a
petition against divorce

Mrs Fisher reddened under her powder and Stepney said with a laughing
glance at Miss Bart I suppose he is thinking of marriage and wants to
tinker up the old ship before he goes aboard

His betrothed looked shocked at the metaphor and George Dorset exclaimed
with a sardonic growl Poor devil It isnt the ship that will do for
him its the crew

Or the stowaways said Miss Corby brightly If I contemplated a voyage
with him I should try to start with a friend in the hold

Miss Van Osburghs vague feeling of pique was struggling for appropriate
expression Im sure I dont see why you laugh at him I think hes very
nice she exclaimed and at any rate a girl who married him would
always have enough to be comfortable

She looked puzzled at the redoubled laughter which hailed her words but
it might have consoled her to know how deeply they had sunk into the
breast of one of her hearers

Comfortable At that moment the word was more eloquent to Lily Bart than
any other in the language She could not even pause to smile over the
heiresss view of a colossal fortune as a mere shelter against want her
mind was filled with the vision of what that shelter might have been to
her Mrs Dorsets pinpricks did not smart for her own irony cut
deeper no one could hurt her as much as she was hurting herself for no
one elsenot even Judy Trenorknew the full magnitude of her folly

She was roused from these unprofitable considerations by a whispered
request from her hostess who drew her apart as they left the
luncheontable

Lily dear if youve nothing special to do may I tell Carry Fisher
that you intend to drive to the station and fetch Gus He will be back at
four and I know she has it in her mind to meet him Of course Im very
glad to have him amused but I happen to know that she has bled him
rather severely since shes been here and she is so keen about going to
fetch him that I fancy she must have got a lot more bills this morning
It seems to me Mrs Trenor feelingly concluded that most of her
alimony is paid by other womens husbands

Miss Bart on her way to the station had leisure to muse over her
friends words and their peculiar application to herself Why should
she have to suffer for having once for a few hours borrowed money of an
elderly cousin when a woman like Carry Fisher could make a living
unrebuked from the goodnature of her men friends and the tolerance of
their wives It all turned on the tiresome distinction between what a
married woman might and a girl might not do Of course it was shocking
for a married woman to borrow moneyand Lily was expertly aware of the
implication involvedbut still it was the mere MALUM PROHIBITUM which
the world decries but condones and which though it may be punished by
private vengeance does not provoke the collective disapprobation of
society To Miss Bart in short no such opportunities were possible She
could of course borrow from her women friendsa hundred here or there
at the utmostbut they were more ready to give a gown or a trinket and
looked a little askance when she hinted her preference for a cheque
Women are not generous lenders and those among whom her lot was cast
were either in the same case as herself or else too far removed from it
to understand its necessities The result of her meditations was the
decision to join her aunt at Richfield She could not remain at Bellomont
without playing bridge and being involved in other expenses and to
continue her usual series of autumn visits would merely prolong the same
difficulties She had reached a point where abrupt retrenchment was
necessary and the only cheap life was a dull life She would start the
next morning for Richfield

At the station she thought Gus Trenor seemed surprised and not wholly
unrelieved to see her She yielded up the reins of the light runabout in
which she had driven over and as he climbed heavily to her side
crushing her into a scant third of the seat he said Halloo It isnt
often you honour me You must have been uncommonly hard up for something
to do

The afternoon was warm and propinquity made her more than usually
conscious that he was red and massive and that beads of moisture had
caused the dust of the train to adhere unpleasantly to the broad expanse
of cheek and neck which he turned to her but she was aware also from
the look in his small dull eyes that the contact with her freshness and
slenderness was as agreeable to him as the sight of a cooling beverage

The perception of this fact helped her to answer gaily Its not often I
have the chance There are too many ladies to dispute the privilege with
me

The privilege of driving me home Well Im glad you won the race
anyhow But I know what really happenedmy wife sent you Now didnt
she

He had the dull mans unexpected flashes of astuteness and Lily could
not help joining in the laugh with which he had pounced on the truth

You see Judy thinks Im the safest person for you to be with and shes
quite right she rejoined

Oh is she though If she is its because you wouldnt waste your time
on an old hulk like me We married men have to put up with what we can
get all the prizes are for the clever chaps whove kept a free foot Let
me light a cigar will you Ive had a beastly day of it

He drew up in the shade of the village street and passed the reins to
her while he held a match to his cigar The little flame under his hand
cast a deeper crimson on his puffing face and Lily averted her eyes with
a momentary feeling of repugnance And yet some women thought him
handsome

As she handed back the reins she said sympathetically Did you have
such a lot of tiresome things to do

I should say sorather Trenor who was seldom listened to either by
his wife or her friends settled down into the rare enjoyment of a
confidential talk You dont know how a fellow has to hustle to keep
this kind of thing going He waved his whip in the direction of the
Bellomont acres which lay outspread before them in opulent undulations
Judy has no idea of what she spendsnot that there isnt plenty to keep
the thing going he interrupted himself but a man has got to keep his
eyes open and pick up all the tips he can My father and mother used to
live like fightingcocks on their income and put by a good bit of it
tooluckily for mebut at the pace we go now I dont know where I
should be if it werent for taking a flyer now and then The women all
thinkI mean Judy thinksIve nothing to do but to go down town once a
month and cut off coupons but the truth is it takes a devilish lot of
hard work to keep the machinery running Not that I ought to complain
today though he went on after a moment for I did a very neat stroke
of business thanks to Stepneys friend Rosedale by the way Miss Lily
I wish youd try to persuade Judy to be decently civil to that chap Hes
going to be rich enough to buy us all out one of these days and if shed
only ask him to dine now and then I could get almost anything out of him
The man is mad to know the people who dont want to know him and when a
fellows in that state there is nothing he wont do for the first woman
who takes him up

Lily hesitated a moment The first part of her companions discourse had
started an interesting train of thought which was rudely interrupted by
the mention of Mr Rosedales name She uttered a faint protest

But you know Jack did try to take him about and he was impossible

Oh hang itbecause hes fat and shiny and has a sloppy manner Well
all I can say is that the people who are clever enough to be civil to him
now will make a mighty good thing of it A few years from now hell be in
it whether we want him or not and then he wont be giving away a
halfamillion tip for a dinner

Lilys mind had reverted from the intrusive personality of Mr Rosedale
to the train of thought set in motion by Trenors first words This vast
mysterious Wall Street world of tips and dealsmight she not find in
it the means of escape from her dreary predicament She had often heard
of women making money in this way through their friends she had no more
notion than most of her sex of the exact nature of the transaction and
its vagueness seemed to diminish its indelicacy She could not indeed
imagine herself in any extremity stooping to extract a tip from Mr
Rosedale but at her side was a man in possession of that precious
commodity and who as the husband of her dearest friend stood to her in
a relation of almost fraternal intimacy

In her inmost heart Lily knew it was not by appealing to the fraternal
instinct that she was likely to move Gus Trenor but this way of
explaining the situation helped to drape its crudity and she was always
scrupulous about keeping up appearances to herself Her personal
fastidiousness had a moral equivalent and when she made a tour of
inspection in her own mind there were certain closed doors she did not
open

As they reached the gates of Bellomont she turned to Trenor with a smile
The afternoon is so perfectdont you want to drive me a little
farther Ive been rather out of spirits all day and its so restful to
be away from people with some one who wont mind if Im a little dull

She looked so plaintively lovely as she proffered the request so
trustfully sure of his sympathy and understanding that Trenor felt
himself wishing that his wife could see how other women treated himnot
battered wirepullers like Mrs Fisher but a girl that most men would
have given their boots to get such a look from

Out of spirits Why on earth should you ever be out of spirits Is your
last box of Doucet dresses a failure or did Judy rook you out of
everything at bridge last night

Lily shook her head with a sigh I have had to give up Doucet and
bridge tooI cant afford it In fact I cant afford any of the things
my friends do and I am afraid Judy often thinks me a bore because I
dont play cards any longer and because I am not as smartly dressed as
the other women But you will think me a bore too if I talk to you about
my worries and I only mention them because I want you to do me a
favourthe very greatest of favours

Her eyes sought his once more and she smiled inwardly at the tinge of
apprehension that she read in them

Why of courseif its anything I can manage He broke off and she
guessed that his enjoyment was disturbed by the remembrance of Mrs
Fishers methods

The greatest of favours she rejoined gently The fact is Judy is
angry with me and I want you to make my peace

Angry with you Oh come nonsense his relief broke through in a
laugh Why you know shes devoted to you

She is the best friend I have and that is why I mind having to vex her
But I daresay you know what she has wanted me to do She has set her
heartpoor dearon my marryingmarrying a great deal of money

She paused with a slight falter of embarrassment and Trenor turning
abruptly fixed on her a look of growing intelligence

A great deal of money Oh by Joveyou dont mean Gryce Whatyou do
Oh no of course I wont mention ityou can trust me to keep my mouth
shutbut Grycegood Lord GRYCE Did Judy really think you could bring
yourself to marry that portentous little ass But you couldnt eh And
so you gave him the sack and thats the reason why he lit out by the
first train this morning He leaned back spreading himself farther
across the seat as if dilated by the joyful sense of his own
discernment How on earth could Judy think you would do such a thing I
could have told her youd never put up with such a little milksop

Lily sighed more deeply I sometimes think she murmured that men
understand a womans motives better than other women do

Some menIm certain of it I could have TOLD Judy he repeated
exulting in the implied superiority over his wife

I thought you would understand thats why I wanted to speak to you
Miss Bart rejoined I cant make that kind of marriage its impossible
But neither can I go on living as all the women in my set do I am almost
entirely dependent on my aunt and though she is very kind to me she
makes me no regular allowance and lately Ive lost money at cards and I
dont dare tell her about it I have paid my card debts of course but
there is hardly anything left for my other expenses and if I go on with
my present life I shall be in horrible difficulties I have a tiny income
of my own but Im afraid its badly invested for it seems to bring in
less every year and I am so ignorant of money matters that I dont know
if my aunts agent who looks after it is a good adviser She paused a
moment and added in a lighter tone I didnt mean to bore you with all
this but I want your help in making Judy understand that I cant at
present go on living as one must live among you all I am going away
tomorrow to join my aunt at Richfield and I shall stay there for the
rest of the autumn and dismiss my maid and learn how to mend my own
clothes

At this picture of loveliness in distress the pathos of which was
heightened by the light touch with which it was drawn a murmur of
indignant sympathy broke from Trenor Twentyfour hours earlier if his
wife had consulted him on the subject of Miss Barts future he would
have said that a girl with extravagant tastes and no money had better
marry the first rich man she could get but with the subject of
discussion at his side turning to him for sympathy making him feel that
he understood her better than her dearest friends and confirming the
assurance by the appeal of her exquisite nearness he was ready to swear
that such a marriage was a desecration and that as a man of honour he
was bound to do all he could to protect her from the results of her
disinterestedness This impulse was reinforced by the reflection that if
she had married Gryce she would have been surrounded by flattery and
approval whereas having refused to sacrifice herself to expediency she
was left to bear the whole cost of her resistance Hang it if he could
find a way out of such difficulties for a professional sponge like Carry
Fisher who was simply a mental habit corresponding to the physical
titillations of the cigarette or the cocktail he could surely do as
much for a girl who appealed to his highest sympathies and who brought
her troubles to him with the trustfulness of a child

Trenor and Miss Bart prolonged their drive till long after sunset and
before it was over he had tried with some show of success to prove to
her that if she would only trust him he could make a handsome sum of
money for her without endangering the small amount she possessed She was
too genuinely ignorant of the manipulations of the stockmarket to
understand his technical explanations or even perhaps to perceive that
certain points in them were slurred the haziness enveloping the
transaction served as a veil for her embarrassment and through the
general blur her hopes dilated like lamps in a fog She understood only
that her modest investments were to be mysteriously multiplied without
risk to herself and the assurance that this miracle would take place
within a short time that there would be no tedious interval for suspense
and reaction relieved her of her lingering scruples

Again she felt the lightening of her load and with it the release of
repressed activities Her immediate worries conjured it was easy to
resolve that she would never again find herself in such straits and as
the need of economy and selfdenial receded from her foreground she felt
herself ready to meet any other demand which life might make Even the
immediate one of letting Trenor as they drove homeward lean a little
nearer and rest his hand reassuringly on hers cost her only a momentary
shiver of reluctance It was part of the game to make him feel that her
appeal had been an uncalculated impulse provoked by the liking he
inspired and the renewed sense of power in handling men while it
consoled her wounded vanity helped also to obscure the thought of the
claim at which his manner hinted He was a coarse dull man who under all
his show of authority was a mere supernumerary in the costly show for
which his money paid surely to a clever girl it would be easy to hold
him by his vanity and so keep the obligation on his side



Chapter 8

The first thousand dollar cheque which Lily received with a blotted
scrawl from Gus Trenor strengthened her selfconfidence in the exact
degree to which it effaced her debts

The transaction had justified itself by its results she saw now how
absurd it would have been to let any primitive scruple deprive her of
this easy means of appeasing her creditors Lily felt really virtuous as
she dispensed the sum in sops to her tradesmen and the fact that a fresh
order accompanied each payment did not lessen her sense of
disinterestedness How many women in her place would have given the
orders without making the payment

She had found it reassuringly easy to keep Trenor in a good humour To
listen to his stories to receive his confidences and laugh at his jokes
seemed for the moment all that was required of her and the complacency
with which her hostess regarded these attentions freed them of the least
hint of ambiguity Mrs Trenor evidently assumed that Lilys growing
intimacy with her husband was simply an indirect way of returning her own
kindness

Im so glad you and Gus have become such good friends she said
approvingly Its too delightful of you to be so nice to him and put up
with all his tiresome stories I know what they are because I had to
listen to them when we were engagedIm sure he is telling the same ones
still And now I shant always have to be asking Carry Fisher here to
keep him in a goodhumour Shes a perfect vulture you know and she
hasnt the least moral sense She is always getting Gus to speculate for
her and Im sure she never pays when she loses

Miss Bart could shudder at this state of things without the embarrassment
of a personal application Her own position was surely quite different
There could be no question of her not paying when she lost since Trenor
had assured her that she was certain not to lose In sending her the
cheque he had explained that he had made five thousand for her out of
Rosedales tip and had put four thousand back in the same venture as
there was the promise of another big rise she understood therefore
that he was now speculating with her own money and that she consequently
owed him no more than the gratitude which such a trifling service
demanded She vaguely supposed that to raise the first sum he had
borrowed on her securities but this was a point over which her curiosity
did not linger It was concentrated for the moment on the probable date
of the next big rise

The news of this event was received by her some weeks later on the
occasion of Jack Stepneys marriage to Miss Van Osburgh As a cousin of
the bridegroom Miss Bart had been asked to act as bridesmaid but she
had declined on the plea that since she was much taller than the other
attendant virgins her presence might mar the symmetry of the group The
truth was she had attended too many brides to the altar when next seen
there she meant to be the chief figure in the ceremony She knew the
pleasantries made at the expense of young girls who have been too long
before the public and she was resolved to avoid such assumptions of
youthfulness as might lead people to think her older than she really was

The Van Osburgh marriage was celebrated in the village church near the
paternal estate on the Hudson It was the simple country wedding to
which guests are convoyed in special trains and from which the hordes of
the uninvited have to be fended off by the intervention of the police
While these sylvan rites were taking place in a church packed with
fashion and festooned with orchids the representatives of the press were
threading their way notebook in hand through the labyrinth of wedding
presents and the agent of a cinematograph syndicate was setting up his
apparatus at the church door It was the kind of scene in which Lily had
often pictured herself as taking the principal part and on this occasion
the fact that she was once more merely a casual spectator instead of the
mystically veiled figure occupying the centre of attention strengthened
her resolve to assume the latter part before the year was over The fact
that her immediate anxieties were relieved did not blind her to a
possibility of their recurrence it merely gave her enough buoyancy to
rise once more above her doubts and feel a renewed faith in her beauty
her power and her general fitness to attract a brilliant destiny It
could not be that one conscious of such aptitudes for mastery and
enjoyment was doomed to a perpetuity of failure and her mistakes looked
easily reparable in the light of her restored selfconfidence

A special appositeness was given to these reflections by the discovery
in a neighbouring pew of the serious profile and neatlytrimmed beard of
Mr Percy Gryce There was something almost bridal in his own aspect his
large white gardenia had a symbolic air that struck Lily as a good omen
After all seen in an assemblage of his kind he was not
ridiculouslooking a friendly critic might have called his heaviness
weighty and he was at his best in the attitude of vacant passivity which
brings out the oddities of the restless She fancied he was the kind of
man whose sentimental associations would be stirred by the conventional
imagery of a wedding and she pictured herself in the seclusion of the
Van Osburgh conservatories playing skillfully upon sensibilities thus
prepared for her touch In fact when she looked at the other women about
her and recalled the image she had brought away from her own glass it
did not seem as though any special skill would be needed to repair her
blunder and bring him once more to her feet

The sight of Seldens dark head in a pew almost facing her disturbed
for a moment the balance of her complacency The rise of her blood as
their eyes met was succeeded by a contrary motion a wave of resistance
and withdrawal She did not wish to see him again not because she feared
his influence but because his presence always had the effect of
cheapening her aspirations of throwing her whole world out of focus
Besides he was a living reminder of the worst mistake in her career and
the fact that he had been its cause did not soften her feelings toward
him She could still imagine an ideal state of existence in which all
else being superadded intercourse with Selden might be the last touch of
luxury but in the world as it was such a privilege was likely to cost
more than it was worth

Lily dear I never saw you look so lovely You look as if something
delightful had just happened to you

The young lady who thus formulated her admiration of her brilliant friend
did not in her own person suggest such happy possibilities Miss
Gertrude Farish in fact typified the mediocre and the ineffectual If
there were compensating qualities in her wide frank glance and the
freshness of her smile these were qualities which only the sympathetic
observer would perceive before noticing that her eyes were of a workaday
grey and her lips without haunting curves Lilys own view of her wavered
between pity for her limitations and impatience at her cheerful
acceptance of them To Miss Bart as to her mother acquiescence in
dinginess was evidence of stupidity and there were moments when in the
consciousness of her own power to look and to be so exactly what the
occasion required she almost felt that other girls were plain and
inferior from choice Certainly no one need have confessed such
acquiescence in her lot as was revealed in the useful colour of Gerty
Farishs gown and the subdued lines of her hat it is almost as stupid to
let your clothes betray that you know you are ugly as to have them
proclaim that you think you are beautiful

Of course being fatally poor and dingy it was wise of Gerty to have
taken up philanthropy and symphony concerts but there was something
irritating in her assumption that existence yielded no higher pleasures
and that one might get as much interest and excitement out of life in a
cramped flat as in the splendours of the Van Osburgh establishment
Today however her chirping enthusiasms did not irritate Lily They
seemed only to throw her own exceptionalness into becoming relief and
give a soaring vastness to her scheme of life

Do let us go and take a peep at the presents before everyone else leaves
the diningroom suggested Miss Farish linking her arm in her friends
It was characteristic of her to take a sentimental and unenvious interest
in all the details of a wedding she was the kind of person who always
kept her handkerchief out during the service and departed clutching a
box of weddingcake

Isnt everything beautifully done she pursued as they entered the
distant drawingroom assigned to the display of Miss Van Osburghs bridal
spoils I always say no one does things better than cousin Grace Did
you ever taste anything more delicious than that MOUSSE of lobster with
champagne sauce I made up my mind weeks ago that I wouldnt miss this
wedding and just fancy how delightfully it all came about When Lawrence
Selden heard I was coming he insisted on fetching me himself and driving
me to the station and when we go back this evening I am to dine with him
at Sherrys I really feel as excited as if I were getting married
myself

Lily smiled she knew that Selden had always been kind to his dull
cousin and she had sometimes wondered why he wasted so much time in such
an unremunerative manner but now the thought gave her a vague pleasure

Do you see him often she asked

Yes he is very good about dropping in on Sundays And now and then we
do a play together but lately I havent seen much of him He doesnt
look well and he seems nervous and unsettled The dear fellow I do
wish he would marry some nice girl I told him so today but he said he
didnt care for the really nice ones and the other kind didnt care for
himbut that was just his joke of course He could never marry a girl
who WASNT nice Oh my dear did you ever see such pearls

They had paused before the table on which the brides jewels were
displayed and Lilys heart gave an envious throb as she caught the
refraction of light from their surfacesthe milky gleam of perfectly
matched pearls the flash of rubies relieved against contrasting velvet
the intense blue rays of sapphires kindled into light by surrounding
diamonds all these precious tints enhanced and deepened by the varied
art of their setting The glow of the stones warmed Lilys veins like
wine More completely than any other expression of wealth they symbolized
the life she longed to lead the life of fastidious aloofness and
refinement in which every detail should have the finish of a jewel and
the whole form a harmonious setting to her own jewellike rareness

Oh Lily do look at this diamond pendantits as big as a
dinnerplate Who can have given it Miss Farish bent shortsightedly
over the accompanying card MR SIMON ROSEDALE What that horrid man
Oh yesI remember hes a friend of Jacks and I suppose cousin Grace
had to ask him here today but she must rather hate having to let Gwen
accept such a present from him

Lily smiled She doubted Mrs Van Osburghs reluctance but was aware of
Miss Farishs habit of ascribing her own delicacies of feeling to the
persons least likely to be encumbered by them

Well if Gwen doesnt care to be seen wearing it she can always exchange
it for something else she remarked

Ah here is something so much prettier Miss Farish continued Do
look at this exquisite white sapphire Im sure the person who chose it
must have taken particular pains What is the name Percy Gryce Ah
then Im not surprised She smiled significantly as she replaced the
card Of course youve heard that hes perfectly devoted to Evie Van
Osburgh Cousin Grace is so pleased about itits quite a romance He
met her first at the George Dorsets only about six weeks ago and its
just the nicest possible marriage for dear Evie Oh I dont mean the
moneyof course she has plenty of her ownbut shes such a quiet
stayathome kind of girl and it seems he has just the same tastes so
they are exactly suited to each other

Lily stood staring vacantly at the white sapphire on its velvet bed
Evie Van Osburgh and Percy Gryce The names rang derisively through her
brain EVIE VAN OSBURGH The youngest dumpiest dullest of the four dull
and dumpy daughters whom Mrs Van Osburgh with unsurpassed astuteness
had placed one by one in enviable niches of existence Ah lucky girls
who grow up in the shelter of a mothers lovea mother who knows how to
contrive opportunities without conceding favours how to take advantage
of propinquity without allowing appetite to be dulled by habit The
cleverest girl may miscalculate where her own interests are concerned
may yield too much at one moment and withdraw too far at the next it
takes a mothers unerring vigilance and foresight to land her daughters
safely in the arms of wealth and suitability

Lilys passing lightheartedness sank beneath a renewed sense of failure
Life was too stupid too blundering Why should Percy Gryces millions be
joined to another great fortune why should this clumsy girl be put in
possession of powers she would never know how to use

She was roused from these speculations by a familiar touch on her arm
and turning saw Gus Trenor beside her She felt a thrill of vexation
what right had he to touch her Luckily Gerty Farish had wandered off to
the next table and they were alone

Trenor looking stouter than ever in his tight frockcoat and
unbecomingly flushed by the bridal libations gazed at her with
undisguised approval

By Jove Lily you do look a stunner He had slipped insensibly into
the use of her Christian name and she had never found the right moment
to correct him Besides in her set all the men and women called each
other by their Christian names it was only on Trenors lips that the
familiar address had an unpleasant significance

Well he continued still jovially impervious to her annoyance have
you made up your mind which of these little trinkets you mean to
duplicate at Tiffanys tomorrow Ive got a cheque for you in my pocket
that will go a long way in that line

Lily gave him a startled look his voice was louder than usual and the
room was beginning to fill with people But as her glance assured her
that they were still beyond earshot a sense of pleasure replaced her
apprehension

Another dividend she asked smiling and drawing near him in the desire
not to be overheard

Well not exactly I sold out on the rise and Ive pulled off four thou
for you Not so bad for a beginner eh I suppose youll begin to think
youre a pretty knowing speculator And perhaps you wont think poor old
Gus such an awful ass as some people do

I think you the kindest of friends but I cant thank you properly now

She let her eyes shine into his with a look that made up for the
handclasp he would have claimed if they had been aloneand how glad she
was that they were not The news filled her with the glow produced by a
sudden cessation of physical pain The world was not so stupid and
blundering after all now and then a stroke of luck came to the
unluckiest At the thought her spirits began to rise it was
characteristic of her that one trifling piece of good fortune should give
wings to all her hopes Instantly came the reflection that Percy Gryce
was not irretrievably lost and she smiled to think of the excitement of
recapturing him from Evie Van Osburgh What chance could such a simpleton
have against her if she chose to exert herself She glanced about hoping
to catch a glimpse of Gryce but her eyes lit instead on the glossy
countenance of Mr Rosedale who was slipping through the crowd with an
air half obsequious half obtrusive as though the moment his presence
was recognized it would swell to the dimensions of the room

Not wishing to be the means of effecting this enlargement Lily quickly
transferred her glance to Trenor to whom the expression of her gratitude
seemed not to have brought the complete gratification she had meant it to
give

Hang thanking meI dont want to be thanked but I SHOULD like the
chance to say two words to you now and then he grumbled I thought you
were going to spend the whole autumn with us and Ive hardly laid eyes
on you for the last month Why cant you come back to Bellomont this
evening Were all alone and Judy is as cross as two sticks Do come and
cheer a fellow up If you say yes Ill run you over in the motor and you
can telephone your maid to bring your traps from town by the next train

Lily shook her head with a charming semblance of regret I wish I
couldbut its quite impossible My aunt has come back to town and I
must be with her for the next few days

Well Ive seen a good deal less of you since weve got to be such pals
than I used to when you were Judys friend he continued with
unconscious penetration

When I was Judys friend Am I not her friend still Really you say the
most absurd things If I were always at Bellomont you would tire of me
much sooner than Judybut come and see me at my aunts the next
afternoon you are in town then we can have a nice quiet talk and you
can tell me how I had better invest my fortune

It was true that during the last three or four weeks she had absented
herself from Bellomont on the pretext of having other visits to pay but
she now began to feel that the reckoning she had thus contrived to evade
had rolled up interest in the interval

The prospect of the nice quiet talk did not appear as allsufficing to
Trenor as she had hoped and his brows continued to lower as he said
Oh I dont know that I can promise you a fresh tip every day But
theres one thing you might do for me and that is just to be a little
civil to Rosedale Judy has promised to ask him to dine when we get to
town but I cant induce her to have him at Bellomont and if you would
let me bring him up now it would make a lot of difference I dont
believe two women have spoken to him this afternoon and I can tell you
hes a chap it pays to be decent to

Miss Bart made an impatient movement but suppressed the words which
seemed about to accompany it After all this was an unexpectedly easy
way of acquitting her debt and had she not reasons of her own for
wishing to be civil to Mr Rosedale

Oh bring him by all means she said smiling perhaps I can get a tip
out of him on my own account

Trenor paused abruptly and his eyes fixed themselves on hers with a look
which made her change colour

I say you knowyoull please remember hes a blooming bounder he
said and with a slight laugh she turned toward the open window near
which they had been standing

The throng in the room had increased and she felt a desire for space and
fresh air Both of these she found on the terrace where only a few men
were lingering over cigarettes and liqueur while scattered couples
strolled across the lawn to the autumntinted borders of the
flowergarden

As she emerged a man moved toward her from the knot of smokers and she
found herself face to face with Selden The stir of the pulses which his
nearness always caused was increased by a slight sense of constraint
They had not met since their Sunday afternoon walk at Bellomont and that
episode was still so vivid to her that she could hardly believe him to be
less conscious of it But his greeting expressed no more than the
satisfaction which every pretty woman expects to see reflected in
masculine eyes and the discovery if distasteful to her vanity was
reassuring to her nerves Between the relief of her escape from Trenor
and the vague apprehension of her meeting with Rosedale it was pleasant
to rest a moment on the sense of complete understanding which Lawrence
Seldens manner always conveyed

This is luck he said smiling I was wondering if I should be able to
have a word with you before the special snatches us away I came with
Gerty Farish and promised not to let her miss the train but I am sure
she is still extracting sentimental solace from the wedding presents She
appears to regard their number and value as evidence of the disinterested
affection of the contracting parties

There was not the least trace of embarrassment in his voice and as he
spoke leaning slightly against the jamb of the window and letting his
eyes rest on her in the frank enjoyment of her grace she felt with a
faint chill of regret that he had gone back without an effort to the
footing on which they had stood before their last talk together Her
vanity was stung by the sight of his unscathed smile She longed to be to
him something more than a piece of sentient prettiness a passing
diversion to his eye and brain and the longing betrayed itself in her
reply

Ah she said I envy Gerty that power she has of dressing up with
romance all our ugly and prosaic arrangements I have never recovered my
selfrespect since you showed me how poor and unimportant my ambitions
were

The words were hardly spoken when she realized their infelicity It
seemed to be her fate to appear at her worst to Selden

I thought on the contrary he returned lightly that I had been the
means of proving they were more important to you than anything else

It was as if the eager current of her being had been checked by a sudden
obstacle which drove it back upon itself She looked at him helplessly
like a hurt or frightened child this real self of hers which he had the
faculty of drawing out of the depths was so little accustomed to go
alone

The appeal of her helplessness touched in him as it always did a latent
chord of inclination It would have meant nothing to him to discover that
his nearness made her more brilliant but this glimpse of a twilight mood
to which he alone had the clue seemed once more to set him in a world
apart with her

At least you cant think worse things of me than you say she exclaimed
with a trembling laugh but before he could answer the flow of
comprehension between them was abruptly stayed by the reappearance of Gus
Trenor who advanced with Mr Rosedale in his wake

Hang it Lily I thought youd given me the slip Rosedale and I have
been hunting all over for you

His voice had a note of conjugal familiarity Miss Bart fancied she
detected in Rosedales eye a twinkling perception of the fact and the
idea turned her dislike of him to repugnance

She returned his profound bow with a slight nod made more disdainful by
the sense of Seldens surprise that she should number Rosedale among her
acquaintances Trenor had turned away and his companion continued to
stand before Miss Bart alert and expectant his lips parted in a smile
at whatever she might be about to say and his very back conscious of the
privilege of being seen with her

It was the moment for tact for the quick bridging over of gaps but
Selden still leaned against the window a detached observer of the scene
and under the spell of his observation Lily felt herself powerless to
exert her usual arts The dread of Seldens suspecting that there was any
need for her to propitiate such a man as Rosedale checked the trivial
phrases of politeness Rosedale still stood before her in an expectant
attitude and she continued to face him in silence her glance just level
with his polished baldness The look put the finishing touch to what her
silence implied

He reddened slowly shifting from one foot to the other fingered the
plump black pearl in his tie and gave a nervous twist to his moustache
then running his eye over her he drew back and said with a
sideglance at Selden Upon my soul I never saw a more ripping getup
Is that the last creation of the dressmaker you go to see at the
Benedick If so I wonder all the other women dont go to her too

The words were projected sharply against Lilys silence and she saw in a
flash that her own act had given them their emphasis In ordinary talk
they might have passed unheeded but following on her prolonged pause
they acquired a special meaning She felt without looking that Selden
had immediately seized it and would inevitably connect the allusion with
her visit to himself The consciousness increased her irritation against
Rosedale but also her feeling that now if ever was the moment to
propitiate him hateful as it was to do so in Seldens presence

How do you know the other women dont go to my dressmaker she
returned You see Im not afraid to give her address to my friends

Her glance and accent so plainly included Rosedale in this privileged
circle that his small eyes puckered with gratification and a knowing
smile drew up his moustache

By Jove you neednt be he declared You could give em the whole
outfit and win at a canter

Ah thats nice of you and it would be nicer still if you would carry
me off to a quiet corner and get me a glass of lemonade or some innocent
drink before we all have to rush for the train

She turned away as she spoke letting him strut at her side through the
gathering groups on the terrace while every nerve in her throbbed with
the consciousness of what Selden must have thought of the scene

But under her angry sense of the perverseness of things and the light
surface of her talk with Rosedale a third idea persisted she did not
mean to leave without an attempt to discover the truth about Percy Gryce
Chance or perhaps his own resolve had kept them apart since his hasty
withdrawal from Bellomont but Miss Bart was an expert in making the most
of the unexpected and the distasteful incidents of the last few
minutesthe revelation to Selden of precisely that part of her life
which she most wished him to ignoreincreased her longing for shelter
for escape from such humiliating contingencies Any definite situation
would be more tolerable than this buffeting of chances which kept her in
an attitude of uneasy alertness toward every possibility of life

Indoors there was a general sense of dispersal in the air as of an
audience gathering itself up for departure after the principal actors had
left the stage but among the remaining groups Lily could discover
neither Gryce nor the youngest Miss Van Osburgh That both should be
missing struck her with foreboding and she charmed Mr Rosedale by
proposing that they should make their way to the conservatories at the
farther end of the house There were just enough people left in the long
suite of rooms to make their progress conspicuous and Lily was aware of
being followed by looks of amusement and interrogation which glanced off
as harmlessly from her indifference as from her companions
selfsatisfaction She cared very little at that moment about being seen
with Rosedale all her thoughts were centred on the object of her search
The latter however was not discoverable in the conservatories and
Lily oppressed by a sudden conviction of failure was casting about for
a way to rid herself of her now superfluous companion when they came
upon Mrs Van Osburgh flushed and exhausted but beaming with the
consciousness of duty performed

She glanced at them a moment with the benign but vacant eye of the tired
hostess to whom her guests have become mere whirling spots in a
kaleidoscope of fatigue then her attention became suddenly fixed and
she seized on Miss Bart with a confidential gesture My dear Lily I
havent had time for a word with you and now I suppose you are just off
Have you seen Evie Shes been looking everywhere for you she wanted to
tell you her little secret but I daresay you have guessed it already
The engagement is not to be announced till next weekbut you are such a
friend of Mr Gryces that they both wished you to be the first to know
of their happiness



Chapter 9

In Mrs Penistons youth fashion had returned to town in October
therefore on the tenth day of the month the blinds of her Fifth Avenue
residence were drawn up and the eyes of the Dying Gladiator in bronze
who occupied the drawingroom window resumed their survey of that
deserted thoroughfare

The first two weeks after her return represented to Mrs Peniston the
domestic equivalent of a religious retreat She went through the linen
and blankets in the precise spirit of the penitent exploring the inner
folds of conscience she sought for moths as the stricken soul seeks for
lurking infirmities The topmost shelf of every closet was made to yield
up its secret cellar and coalbin were probed to their darkest depths
and as a final stage in the lustral rites the entire house was swathed
in penitential white and deluged with expiatory soapsuds

It was on this phase of the proceedings that Miss Bart entered on the
afternoon of her return from the Van Osburgh wedding The journey back to
town had not been calculated to soothe her nerves Though Evie Van
Osburghs engagement was still officially a secret it was one of which
the innumerable intimate friends of the family were already possessed
and the trainful of returning guests buzzed with allusions and
anticipations Lily was acutely aware of her own part in this drama of
innuendo she knew the exact quality of the amusement the situation
evoked The crude forms in which her friends took their pleasure included
a loud enjoyment of such complications the zest of surprising destiny in
the act of playing a practical joke Lily knew well enough how to bear
herself in difficult situations She had to a shade the exact manner
between victory and defeat every insinuation was shed without an effort
by the bright indifference of her manner But she was beginning to feel
the strain of the attitude the reaction was more rapid and she lapsed
to a deeper selfdisgust


As was always the case with her this moral repulsion found a physical
outlet in a quickened distaste for her surroundings She revolted from
the complacent ugliness of Mrs Penistons black walnut from the
slippery gloss of the vestibule tiles and the mingled odour of sapolio
and furniturepolish that met her at the door

The stairs were still carpetless and on the way up to her room she was
arrested on the landing by an encroaching tide of soapsuds Gathering up
her skirts she drew aside with an impatient gesture and as she did so
she had the odd sensation of having already found herself in the same
situation but in different surroundings It seemed to her that she was
again descending the staircase from Seldens rooms and looking down to
remonstrate with the dispenser of the soapy flood she found herself met
by a lifted stare which had once before confronted her under similar
circumstances It was the charwoman of the Benedick who resting on
crimson elbows examined her with the same unflinching curiosity the
same apparent reluctance to let her pass On this occasion however Miss
Bart was on her own ground

Dont you see that I wish to go by Please move your pail she said
sharply

The woman at first seemed not to hear then without a word of excuse
she pushed back her pail and dragged a wet floorcloth across the
landing keeping her eyes fixed on Lily while the latter swept by It was
insufferable that Mrs Peniston should have such creatures about the
house and Lily entered her room resolved that the woman should be
dismissed that evening

Mrs Peniston however was at the moment inaccessible to remonstrance
since early morning she had been shut up with her maid going over her
furs a process which formed the culminating episode in the drama of
household renovation In the evening also Lily found herself alone for
her aunt who rarely dined out had responded to the summons of a Van
Alstyne cousin who was passing through town The house in its state of
unnatural immaculateness and order was as dreary as a tomb and as Lily
turning from her brief repast between shrouded sideboards wandered into
the newlyuncovered glare of the drawingroom she felt as though she were
buried alive in the stifling limits of Mrs Penistons existence

She usually contrived to avoid being at home during the season of
domestic renewal On the present occasion however a variety of reasons
had combined to bring her to town and foremost among them was the fact
that she had fewer invitations than usual for the autumn She had so long
been accustomed to pass from one countryhouse to another till the close
of the holidays brought her friends to town that the unfilled gaps of
time confronting her produced a sharp sense of waning popularity It was
as she had said to Seldenpeople were tired of her They would welcome
her in a new character but as Miss Bart they knew her by heart She
knew herself by heart too and was sick of the old story There were
moments when she longed blindly for anything different anything strange
remote and untried but the utmost reach of her imagination did not go
beyond picturing her usual life in a new setting She could not figure
herself as anywhere but in a drawingroom diffusing elegance as a flower
sheds perfume

Meanwhile as October advanced she had to face the alternative of
returning to the Trenors or joining her aunt in town Even the desolating
dulness of New York in October and the soapy discomforts of Mrs
Penistons interior seemed preferable to what might await her at
Bellomont and with an air of heroic devotion she announced her intention
of remaining with her aunt till the holidays

Sacrifices of this nature are sometimes received with feelings as mixed
as those which actuate them and Mrs Peniston remarked to her
confidential maid that if any of the family were to be with her at such
a crisis though for forty years she had been thought competent to see to
the hanging of her own curtains she would certainly have preferred Miss
Grace to Miss Lily Grace Stepney was an obscure cousin of adaptable
manners and vicarious interests who ran in to sit with Mrs Peniston
when Lily dined out too continuously who played bezique picked up
dropped stitches read out the deaths from the Times and sincerely
admired the purple satin drawingroom curtains the Dying Gladiator in
the window and the sevenbyfive painting of Niagara which represented
the one artistic excess of Mr Penistons temperate career

Mrs Peniston under ordinary circumstances was as much bored by her
excellent cousin as the recipient of such services usually is by the
person who performs them She greatly preferred the brilliant and
unreliable Lily who did not know one end of a crochetneedle from the
other and had frequently wounded her susceptibilities by suggesting that
the drawingroom should be done over But when it came to hunting for
missing napkins or helping to decide whether the backstairs needed
recarpeting Graces judgment was certainly sounder than Lilys not to
mention the fact that the latter resented the smell of beeswax and brown
soap and behaved as though she thought a house ought to keep clean of
itself without extraneous assistance

Seated under the cheerless blaze of the drawingroom chandelierMrs
Peniston never lit the lamps unless there was companyLily seemed to
watch her own figure retreating down vistas of neutraltinted dulness to
a middle age like Grace Stepneys When she ceased to amuse Judy Trenor
and her friends she would have to fall back on amusing Mrs Peniston
whichever way she looked she saw only a future of servitude to the whims
of others never the possibility of asserting her own eager individuality

A ring at the doorbell sounding emphatically through the empty house
roused her suddenly to the extent of her boredom It was as though all
the weariness of the past months had culminated in the vacuity of that
interminable evening If only the ring meant a summons from the outer
worlda token that she was still remembered and wanted

After some delay a parlourmaid presented herself with the announcement
that there was a person outside who was asking to see Miss Bart and on
Lilys pressing for a more specific description she added

Its Mrs Haffen Miss she wont say what she wants

Lily to whom the name conveyed nothing opened the door upon a woman in
a battered bonnet who stood firmly planted under the halllight The
glare of the unshaded gas shone familiarly on her pockmarked face and
the reddish baldness visible through thin strands of strawcoloured hair
Lily looked at the charwoman in surprise

Do you wish to see me she asked

I should like to say a word to you Miss The tone was neither
aggressive nor conciliatory it revealed nothing of the speakers errand
Nevertheless some precautionary instinct warned Lily to withdraw beyond
earshot of the hovering parlourmaid

She signed to Mrs Haffen to follow her into the drawingroom and closed
the door when they had entered

What is it that you wish she enquired

The charwoman after the manner of her kind stood with her arms folded
in her shawl Unwinding the latter she produced a small parcel wrapped
in dirty newspaper

I have something here that you might like to see Miss Bart She spoke
the name with an unpleasant emphasis as though her knowing it made a
part of her reason for being there To Lily the intonation sounded like a
threat

You have found something belonging to me she asked extending her hand

Mrs Haffen drew back Well if it comes to that I guess its mine as
much as anybodys she returned

Lily looked at her perplexedly She was sure now that her visitors
manner conveyed a threat but expert as she was in certain directions
there was nothing in her experience to prepare her for the exact
significance of the present scene She felt however that it must be
ended as promptly as possible

I dont understand if this parcel is not mine why have you asked for
me

The woman was unabashed by the question She was evidently prepared to
answer it but like all her class she had to go a long way back to make a
beginning and it was only after a pause that she replied My husband
was janitor to the Benedick till the first of the month since then he
cant get nothing to do

Lily remained silent and she continued It wasnt no fault of our own
neither the agent had another man he wanted the place for and we was
put out bag and baggage just to suit his fancy I had a long sickness
last winter and an operation that ate up all wed put by and its hard
for me and the children Haffen being so long out of a job

After all then she had come only to ask Miss Bart to find a place for
her husband or more probably to seek the young ladys intervention
with Mrs Peniston Lily had such an air of always getting what she
wanted that she was used to being appealed to as an intermediary and
relieved of her vague apprehension she took refuge in the conventional
formula

I am sorry you have been in trouble she said

Oh that we have Miss and its ony just beginning If ony wed a
got another situationbut the agent hes dead against us It aint no
fault of ours neither but

At this point Lilys impatience overcame her If you have anything to
say to me she interposed

The womans resentment of the rebuff seemed to spur her lagging ideas

Yes Miss Im coming to that she said She paused again with her
eyes on Lily and then continued in a tone of diffuse narrative When
we was at the Benedick I had charge of some of the gentlemens rooms
leastways I swep em out on Saturdays Some of the gentlemen got the
greatest sight of letters I never saw the like of it Their wastepaper
baskets d be fairly brimming and papers falling over on the floor
Maybe havin so many is how they get so careless Some of em is worse
than others Mr Selden Mr Lawrence Selden he was always one of the
carefullest burnt his letters in winter and tore em in little bits in
summer But sometimes hed have so many hed just bunch em together the
way the others did and tear the lot through oncelike this

While she spoke she had loosened the string from the parcel in her hand
and now she drew forth a letter which she laid on the table between Miss
Bart and herself As she had said the letter was torn in two but with a
rapid gesture she laid the torn edges together and smoothed out the page

A wave of indignation swept over Lily She felt herself in the presence
of something vile as yet but dimly conjecturedthe kind of vileness of
which people whispered but which she had never thought of as touching
her own life She drew back with a motion of disgust but her withdrawal
was checked by a sudden discovery under the glare of Mrs Penistons
chandelier she had recognized the handwriting of the letter It was a
large disjointed hand with a flourish of masculinity which but slightly
disguised its rambling weakness and the words scrawled in heavy ink on
paletinted notepaper smote on Lilys ear as though she had heard them
spoken

At first she did not grasp the full import of the situation She
understood only that before her lay a letter written by Bertha Dorset
and addressed presumably to Lawrence Selden There was no date but the
blackness of the ink proved the writing to be comparatively recent The
packet in Mrs Haffens hand doubtless contained more letters of the same
kinda dozen Lily conjectured from its thickness The letter before her
was short but its few words which had leapt into her brain before she
was conscious of reading them told a long historya history over which
for the last four years the friends of the writer had smiled and
shrugged viewing it merely as one among the countless good situations
of the mundane comedy Now the other side presented itself to Lily the
volcanic nether side of the surface over which conjecture and innuendo
glide so lightly till the first fissure turns their whisper to a shriek
Lily knew that there is nothing society resents so much as having given
its protection to those who have not known how to profit by it it is for
having betrayed its connivance that the body social punishes the offender
who is found out And in this case there was no doubt of the issue The
code of Lilys world decreed that a womans husband should be the only
judge of her conduct she was technically above suspicion while she had
the shelter of his approval or even of his indifference But with a man
of George Dorsets temper there could be no thought of condonationthe
possessor of his wifes letters could overthrow with a touch the whole
structure of her existence And into what hands Bertha Dorsets secret
had been delivered For a moment the irony of the coincidence tinged
Lilys disgust with a confused sense of triumph But the disgust
prevailedall her instinctive resistances of taste of training of
blind inherited scruples rose against the other feeling Her strongest
sense was one of personal contamination

She moved away as though to put as much distance as possible between
herself and her visitor I know nothing of these letters she said I
have no idea why you have brought them here

Mrs Haffen faced her steadily Ill tell you why Miss I brought em
to you to sell because I aint got no other way of raising money and if
we dont pay our rent by tomorrow night well be put out I never done
anythin of the kind before and if youd speak to Mr Selden or to Mr
Rosedale about getting Haffen taken on again at the BenedickI seen you
talking to Mr Rosedale on the steps that day you come out of Mr
Seldens rooms

The blood rushed to Lilys forehead She understood nowMrs Haffen
supposed her to be the writer of the letters In the first leap of her
anger she was about to ring and order the woman out but an obscure
impulse restrained her The mention of Seldens name had started a new
train of thought Bertha Dorsets letters were nothing to herthey might
go where the current of chance carried them But Selden was inextricably
involved in their fate Men do not at worst suffer much from such
exposure and in this instance the flash of divination which had carried
the meaning of the letters to Lilys brain had revealed also that they
were appealsrepeated and therefore probably unansweredfor the renewal
of a tie which time had evidently relaxed Nevertheless the fact that
the correspondence had been allowed to fall into strange hands would
convict Selden of negligence in a matter where the world holds it least
pardonable and there were graver risks to consider where a man of
Dorsets ticklish balance was concerned

If she weighed all these things it was unconsciously she was aware only
of feeling that Selden would wish the letters rescued and that therefore
she must obtain possession of them Beyond that her mind did not travel
She had indeed a quick vision of returning the packet to Bertha Dorset
and of the opportunities the restitution offered but this thought lit up
abysses from which she shrank back ashamed

Meanwhile Mrs Haffen prompt to perceive her hesitation had already
opened the packet and ranged its contents on the table All the letters
had been pieced together with strips of thin paper Some were in small
fragments the others merely torn in half Though there were not many
thus spread out they nearly covered the table Lilys glance fell on a
word here and therethen she said in a low voice What do you wish me
to pay you

Mrs Haffens face reddened with satisfaction It was clear that the
young lady was badly frightened and Mrs Haffen was the woman to make
the most of such fears Anticipating an easier victory than she had
foreseen she named an exorbitant sum

But Miss Bart showed herself a less ready prey than might have been
expected from her imprudent opening She refused to pay the price named
and after a moments hesitation met it by a counteroffer of half the
amount

Mrs Haffen immediately stiffened Her hand travelled toward the
outspread letters and folding them slowly she made as though to restore
them to their wrapping

I guess theyre worth more to you than to me Miss but the poor has got
to live as well as the rich she observed sententiously


Lily was throbbing with fear but the insinuation fortified her
resistance

You are mistaken she said indifferently I have offered all I am
willing to give for the letters but there may be other ways of getting
them

Mrs Haffen raised a suspicious glance she was too experienced not to
know that the traffic she was engaged in had perils as great as its
rewards and she had a vision of the elaborate machinery of revenge which
a word of this commanding young ladys might set in motion

She applied the corner of her shawl to her eyes and murmured through it
that no good came of bearing too hard on the poor but that for her part
she had never been mixed up in such a business before and that on her
honour as a Christian all she and Haffen had thought of was that the
letters mustnt go any farther

Lily stood motionless keeping between herself and the charwoman the
greatest distance compatible with the need of speaking in low tones The
idea of bargaining for the letters was intolerable to her but she knew
that if she appeared to weaken Mrs Haffen would at once increase her
original demand

She could never afterward recall how long the duel lasted or what was
the decisive stroke which finally after a lapse of time recorded in
minutes by the clock in hours by the precipitate beat of her pulses put
her in possession of the letters she knew only that the door had finally
closed and that she stood alone with the packet in her hand

She had no idea of reading the letters even to unfold Mrs Haffens
dirty newspaper would have seemed degrading But what did she intend to
do with its contents The recipient of the letters had meant to destroy
them and it was her duty to carry out his intention She had no right to
keep themto do so was to lessen whatever merit lay in having secured
their possession But how destroy them so effectually that there should
be no second risk of their falling in such hands Mrs Penistons icy
drawingroom grate shone with a forbidding lustre the fire like the
lamps was never lit except when there was company

Miss Bart was turning to carry the letters upstairs when she heard the
opening of the outer door and her aunt entered the drawingroom Mrs
Peniston was a small plump woman with a colourless skin lined with
trivial wrinkles Her grey hair was arranged with precision and her
clothes looked excessively new and yet slightly oldfashioned They were
always black and tightly fitting with an expensive glitter she was the
kind of woman who wore jet at breakfast Lily had never seen her when she
was not cuirassed in shining black with small tight boots and an air of
being packed and ready to start yet she never started

She looked about the drawingroom with an expression of minute scrutiny
I saw a streak of light under one of the blinds as I drove up its
extraordinary that I can never teach that woman to draw them down evenly

Having corrected the irregularity she seated herself on one of the
glossy purple armchairs Mrs Peniston always sat on a chair never in
it

Then she turned her glance to Miss Bart My dear you look tired I
suppose its the excitement of the wedding Cornelia Van Alstyne was full
of it Molly was there and Gerty Farish ran in for a minute to tell us
about it I think it was odd their serving melons before the CONSOMME a
wedding breakfast should always begin with CONSOMME Molly didnt care
for the bridesmaids dresses She had it straight from Julia Melson that
they cost three hundred dollars apiece at Celestes but she says they
didnt look it Im glad you decided not to be a bridesmaid that shade
of salmonpink wouldnt have suited you Mrs Peniston delighted in
discussing the minutest details of festivities in which she had not taken
part Nothing would have induced her to undergo the exertion and fatigue
of attending the Van Osburgh wedding but so great was her interest in
the event that having heard two versions of it she now prepared to
extract a third from her niece Lily however had been deplorably
careless in noting the particulars of the entertainment She had failed
to observe the colour of Mrs Van Osburghs gown and could not even say
whether the old Van Osburgh Sevres had been used at the brides table
Mrs Peniston in short found that she was of more service as a listener
than as a narrator

Really Lily I dont see why you took the trouble to go to the wedding
if you dont remember what happened or whom you saw there When I was a
girl I used to keep the MENU of every dinner I went to and write the
names of the people on the back and I never threw away my cotillion
favours till after your uncles death when it seemed unsuitable to have
so many coloured things about the house I had a whole closetfull I
remember and I can tell to this day what balls I got them at Molly Van
Alstyne reminds me of what I was at that age its wonderful how she
notices She was able to tell her mother exactly how the weddingdress
was cut and we knew at once from the fold in the back that it must
have come from Paquin

Mrs Peniston rose abruptly and advancing to the ormolu clock
surmounted by a helmeted Minerva which throned on the chimneypiece
between two malachite vases passed her lace handkerchief between the
helmet and its visor

I knew itthe parlourmaid never dusts there she exclaimed
triumphantly displaying a minute spot on the handkerchief then
reseating herself she went on Molly thought Mrs Dorset the
bestdressed woman at the wedding Ive no doubt her dress DID cost more
than any one elses but I cant quite like the ideaa combination of
sable and POINT DE MILAN It seems she goes to a new man in Paris who
wont take an order till his client has spent a day with him at his villa
at Neuilly He says he must study his subjects home lifea most
peculiar arrangement I should say But Mrs Dorset told Molly about it
herself she said the villa was full of the most exquisite things and she
was really sorry to leave Molly said she never saw her looking better
she was in tremendous spirits and said she had made a match between Evie
Van Osburgh and Percy Gryce She really seems to have a very good
influence on young men I hear she is interesting herself now in that
silly Silverton boy who has had his head turned by Carry Fisher and has
been gambling so dreadfully Well as I was saying Evie is really
engaged Mrs Dorset had her to stay with Percy Gryce and managed it
all and Grace Van Osburgh is in the seventh heavenshe had almost
despaired of marrying Evie

Mrs Peniston again paused but this time her scrutiny addressed itself
not to the furniture but to her niece

Cornelia Van Alstyne was so surprised she had heard that you were to
marry young Gryce She saw the Wetheralls just after they had stopped
with you at Bellomont and Alice Wetherall was quite sure there was an
engagement She said that when Mr Gryce left unexpectedly one morning
they all thought he had rushed to town for the ring

Lily rose and moved toward the door

I believe I AM tired I think I will go to bed she said and Mrs
Peniston suddenly distracted by the discovery that the easel sustaining
the late Mr Penistons crayonportrait was not exactly in line with the
sofa in front of it presented an absentminded brow to her kiss

In her own room Lily turned up the gasjet and glanced toward the grate
It was as brilliantly polished as the one below but here at least she
could burn a few papers with less risk of incurring her aunts
disapproval She made no immediate motion to do so however but dropping
into a chair looked wearily about her Her room was large and
comfortablyfurnishedit was the envy and admiration of poor Grace
Stepney who boarded but contrasted with the light tints and luxurious
appointments of the guestrooms where so many weeks of Lilys existence
were spent it seemed as dreary as a prison The monumental wardrobe and
bedstead of black walnut had migrated from Mr Penistons bedroom and
the magenta flock wallpaper of a pattern dear to the early sixties
was hung with large steel engravings of an anecdotic character Lily had
tried to mitigate this charmless background by a few frivolous touches
in the shape of a lacedecked toilet table and a little painted desk
surmounted by photographs but the futility of the attempt struck her as
she looked about the room What a contrast to the subtle elegance of the
setting she had pictured for herselfan apartment which should surpass
the complicated luxury of her friends surroundings by the whole extent
of that artistic sensibility which made her feel herself their superior
in which every tint and line should combine to enhance her beauty and
give distinction to her leisure Once more the haunting sense of physical
ugliness was intensified by her mental depression so that each piece of
the offending furniture seemed to thrust forth its most aggressive angle

Her aunts words had told her nothing new but they had revived the
vision of Bertha Dorset smiling flattered victorious holding her up
to ridicule by insinuations intelligible to every member of their little
group The thought of the ridicule struck deeper than any other
sensation Lily knew every turn of the allusive jargon which could flay
its victims without the shedding of blood Her cheek burned at the
recollection and she rose and caught up the letters She no longer meant
to destroy them that intention had been effaced by the quick corrosion
of Mrs Penistons words

Instead she approached her desk and lighting a taper tied and sealed
the packet then she opened the wardrobe drew out a despatchbox and
deposited the letters within it As she did so it struck her with a
flash of irony that she was indebted to Gus Trenor for the means of
buying them



Chapter 10

The autumn dragged on monotonously Miss Bart had received one or two
notes from Judy Trenor reproaching her for not returning to Bellomont
but she replied evasively alleging the obligation to remain with her
aunt In truth however she was fast wearying of her solitary existence
with Mrs Peniston and only the excitement of spending her
newlyacquired money lightened the dulness of the days

All her life Lily had seen money go out as quickly as it came in and
whatever theories she cultivated as to the prudence of setting aside a
part of her gains she had unhappily no saving vision of the risks of the
opposite course It was a keen satisfaction to feel that for a few
months at least she would be independent of her friends bounty that
she could show herself abroad without wondering whether some penetrating
eye would detect in her dress the traces of Judy Trenors refurbished
splendour The fact that the money freed her temporarily from all minor
obligations obscured her sense of the greater one it represented and
having never before known what it was to command so large a sum she
lingered delectably over the amusement of spending it

It was on one of these occasions that leaving a shop where she had spent
an hour of deliberation over a dressingcase of the most complicated
elegance she ran across Miss Farish who had entered the same
establishment with the modest object of having her watch repaired Lily
was feeling unusually virtuous She had decided to defer the purchase of
the dressingcase till she should receive the bill for her new
operacloak and the resolve made her feel much richer than when she had
entered the shop In this mood of selfapproval she had a sympathetic eye
for others and she was struck by her friends air of dejection

Miss Farish it appeared had just left the committeemeeting of a
struggling charity in which she was interested The object of the
association was to provide comfortable lodgings with a readingroom and
other modest distractions where young women of the class employed in
down town offices might find a home when out of work or in need of rest
and the first years financial report showed so deplorably small a
balance that Miss Farish who was convinced of the urgency of the work
felt proportionately discouraged by the small amount of interest it
aroused The otherregarding sentiments had not been cultivated in Lily
and she was often bored by the relation of her friends philanthropic
efforts but today her quick dramatizing fancy seized on the contrast
between her own situation and that represented by some of Gertys
cases These were young girls like herself some perhaps pretty some
not without a trace of her finer sensibilities She pictured herself
leading such a life as theirsa life in which achievement seemed as
squalid as failureand the vision made her shudder sympathetically The
price of the dressingcase was still in her pocket and drawing out her
little gold purse she slipped a liberal fraction of the amount into Miss
Farishs hand

The satisfaction derived from this act was all that the most ardent
moralist could have desired Lily felt a new interest in herself as a
person of charitable instincts she had never before thought of doing
good with the wealth she had so often dreamed of possessing but now her
horizon was enlarged by the vision of a prodigal philanthropy Moreover
by some obscure process of logic she felt that her momentary burst of
generosity had justified all previous extravagances and excused any in
which she might subsequently indulge Miss Farishs surprise and
gratitude confirmed this feeling and Lily parted from her with a sense
of selfesteem which she naturally mistook for the fruits of altruism

About this time she was farther cheered by an invitation to spend the
Thanksgiving week at a camp in the Adirondacks The invitation was one
which a year earlier would have provoked a less ready response for the
party though organized by Mrs Fisher was ostensibly given by a lady of
obscure origin and indomitable social ambitions whose acquaintance Lily
had hitherto avoided Now however she was disposed to coincide with
Mrs Fishers view that it didnt matter who gave the party as long as
things were well done and doing things well under competent direction
was Mrs Wellington Brys strong point The lady whose consort was known
as Welly Bry on the Stock Exchange and in sporting circles had already
sacrificed one husband and sundry minor considerations to her
determination to get on and having obtained a hold on Carry Fisher she
was astute enough to perceive the wisdom of committing herself entirely
to that ladys guidance Everything accordingly was well done for
there was no limit to Mrs Fishers prodigality when she was not spending
her own money and as she remarked to her pupil a good cook was the best
introduction to society If the company was not as select as the CUISINE
the Welly Brys at least had the satisfaction of figuring for the first
time in the society columns in company with one or two noticeable names
and foremost among these was of course Miss Barts The young lady was
treated by her hosts with corresponding deference and she was in the
mood when such attentions are acceptable whatever their source Mrs
Brys admiration was a mirror in which Lilys selfcomplacency recovered
its lost outline No insect hangs its nest on threads as frail as those
which will sustain the weight of human vanity and the sense of being of
importance among the insignificant was enough to restore to Miss Bart the
gratifying consciousness of power If these people paid court to her it
proved that she was still conspicuous in the world to which they aspired
and she was not above a certain enjoyment in dazzling them by her
fineness in developing their puzzled perception of her superiorities

Perhaps however her enjoyment proceeded more than she was aware from
the physical stimulus of the excursion the challenge of crisp cold and
hard exercise the responsive thrill of her body to the influences of the
winter woods She returned to town in a glow of rejuvenation conscious
of a clearer colour in her cheeks a fresh elasticity in her muscles The
future seemed full of a vague promise and all her apprehensions were
swept out of sight on the buoyant current of her mood

A few days after her return to town she had the unpleasant surprise of a
visit from Mr Rosedale He came late at the confidential hour when the
teatable still lingers by the fire in friendly expectancy and his
manner showed a readiness to adapt itself to the intimacy of the occasion

Lily who had a vague sense of his being somehow connected with her lucky
speculations tried to give him the welcome he expected but there was
something in the quality of his geniality which chilled her own and she
was conscious of marking each step in their acquaintance by a fresh
blunder

Mr Rosedalemaking himself promptly at home in an adjoining easychair
and sipping his tea critically with the comment You ought to go to my
man for something really goodappeared totally unconscious of the
repugnance which kept her in frozen erectness behind the urn It was
perhaps her very manner of holding herself aloof that appealed to his
collectors passion for the rare and unattainable He gave at any rate
no sign of resenting it and seemed prepared to supply in his own manner
all the ease that was lacking in hers

His object in calling was to ask her to go to the opera in his box on the
opening night and seeing her hesitate he said persuasively Mrs Fisher
is coming and Ive secured a tremendous admirer of yours wholl never
forgive me if you dont accept

As Lilys silence left him with this allusion on his hands he added with
a confidential smile Gus Trenor has promised to come to town on
purpose I fancy hed go a good deal farther for the pleasure of seeing
you

Miss Bart felt an inward motion of annoyance it was distasteful enough
to hear her name coupled with Trenors and on Rosedales lips the
allusion was peculiarly unpleasant

The Trenors are my best friendsI think we should all go a long way to
see each other she said absorbing herself in the preparation of fresh
tea

Her visitors smile grew increasingly intimate Well I wasnt thinking
of Mrs Trenor at the momentthey say Gus doesnt always you know
Then dimly conscious that he had not struck the right note he added
with a wellmeant effort at diversion Hows your luck been going in
Wall Street by the way I hear Gus pulled off a nice little pile for you
last month

Lily put down the teacaddy with an abrupt gesture She felt that her
hands were trembling and clasped them on her knee to steady them but
her lip trembled too and for a moment she was afraid the tremor might
communicate itself to her voice When she spoke however it was in a
tone of perfect lightness

Ah yesI had a little bit of money to invest and Mr Trenor who
helps me about such matters advised my putting it in stocks instead of a
mortgage as my aunts agent wanted me to do and as it happened I made
a lucky turnis that what you call it For you make a great many
yourself I believe

She was smiling back at him now relaxing the tension of her attitude
and admitting him by imperceptible gradations of glance and manner a
step farther toward intimacy The protective instinct always nerved her
to successful dissimulation and it was not the first time she had used
her beauty to divert attention from an inconvenient topic

When Mr Rosedale took leave he carried with him not only her
acceptance of his invitation but a general sense of having comported
himself in a way calculated to advance his cause He had always believed
he had a light touch and a knowing way with women and the prompt manner
in which Miss Bart as he would have phrased it had come into line
confirmed his confidence in his powers of handling this skittish sex Her
way of glossing over the transaction with Trenor he regarded at once as a
tribute to his own acuteness and a confirmation of his suspicions The
girl was evidently nervous and Mr Rosedale if he saw no other means of
advancing his acquaintance with her was not above taking advantage of
her nervousness

He left Lily to a passion of disgust and fear It seemed incredible that
Gus Trenor should have spoken of her to Rosedale With all his faults
Trenor had the safeguard of his traditions and was the less likely to
overstep them because they were so purely instinctive But Lily recalled
with a pang that there were convivial moments when as Judy had confided
to her Gus talked foolishly in one of these no doubt the fatal word
had slipped from him As for Rosedale she did not after the first
shock greatly care what conclusions he had drawn Though usually adroit
enough where her own interests were concerned she made the mistake not
uncommon to persons in whom the social habits are instinctive of
supposing that the inability to acquire them quickly implies a general
dulness Because a bluebottle bangs irrationally against a windowpane
the drawingroom naturalist may forget that under less artificial
conditions it is capable of measuring distances and drawing conclusions
with all the accuracy needful to its welfare and the fact that Mr
Rosedales drawingroom manner lacked perspective made Lily class him
with Trenor and the other dull men she knew and assume that a little
flattery and the occasional acceptance of his hospitality would suffice
to render him innocuous However there could be no doubt of the
expediency of showing herself in his box on the opening night of the
opera and after all since Judy Trenor had promised to take him up that
winter it was as well to reap the advantage of being first in the field

For a day or two after Rosedales visit Lilys thoughts were dogged by
the consciousness of Trenors shadowy claim and she wished she had a
clearer notion of the exact nature of the transaction which seemed to
have put her in his power but her mind shrank from any unusual
application and she was always helplessly puzzled by figures Moreover
she had not seen Trenor since the day of the Van Osburgh wedding and in
his continued absence the trace of Rosedales words was soon effaced by
other impressions

When the opening night of the opera came her apprehensions had so
completely vanished that the sight of Trenors ruddy countenance in the
back of Mr Rosedales box filled her with a sense of pleasant
reassurance Lily had not quite reconciled herself to the necessity of
appearing as Rosedales guest on so conspicuous an occasion and it was a
relief to find herself supported by any one of her own setfor Mrs
Fishers social habits were too promiscuous for her presence to justify
Miss Barts

To Lily always inspirited by the prospect of showing her beauty in
public and conscious tonight of all the added enhancements of dress the
insistency of Trenors gaze merged itself in the general stream of
admiring looks of which she felt herself the centre Ah it was good to
be young to be radiant to glow with the sense of slenderness strength
and elasticity of wellpoised lines and happy tints to feel ones self
lifted to a height apart by that incommunicable grace which is the bodily
counterpart of genius

All means seemed justifiable to attain such an end or rather by a happy
shifting of lights with which practice had familiarized Miss Bart the
cause shrank to a pinpoint in the general brightness of the effect But
brilliant young ladies a little blinded by their own effulgence are apt
to forget that the modest satellite drowned in their light is still
performing its own revolutions and generating heat at its own rate If
Lilys poetic enjoyment of the moment was undisturbed by the base thought
that her gown and opera cloak had been indirectly paid for by Gus Trenor
the latter had not sufficient poetry in his composition to lose sight of
these prosaic facts He knew only that he had never seen Lily look
smarter in her life that there wasnt a woman in the house who showed
off good clothes as she did and that hitherto he to whom she owed the
opportunity of making this display had reaped no return beyond that of
gazing at her in company with several hundred other pairs of eyes

It came to Lily therefore as a disagreeable surprise when in the back of
the box where they found themselves alone between two acts Trenor said
without preamble and in a tone of sulky authority Look here Lily how
is a fellow ever to see anything of you Im in town three or four days
in the week and you know a line to the club will always find me but you
dont seem to remember my existence nowadays unless you want to get a tip
out of me

The fact that the remark was in distinctly bad taste did not make it any
easier to answer for Lily was vividly aware that it was not the moment
for that drawing up of her slim figure and surprised lifting of the brows
by which she usually quelled incipient signs of familiarity

Im very much flattered by your wanting to see me she returned
essaying lightness instead but unless you have mislaid my address it
would have been easy to find me any afternoon at my auntsin fact I
rather expected you to look me up there

If she hoped to mollify him by this last concession the attempt was a
failure for he only replied with the familiar lowering of the brows
that made him look his dullest when he was angry Hang going to your
aunts and wasting the afternoon listening to a lot of other chaps
talking to you You know Im not the kind to sit in a crowd and jawId
always rather clear out when that sort of circus is going on But why
cant we go off somewhere on a little lark togethera nice quiet little
expedition like that drive at Bellomont the day you met me at the
station

He leaned unpleasantly close in order to convey this suggestion and she
fancied she caught a significant aroma which explained the dark flush on
his face and the glistening dampness of his forehead

The idea that any rash answer might provoke an unpleasant outburst
tempered her disgust with caution and she answered with a laugh I
dont see how one can very well take country drives in town but I am not
always surrounded by an admiring throng and if you will let me know what
afternoon you are coming I will arrange things so that we can have a nice
quiet talk

Hang talking Thats what you always say returned Trenor whose
expletives lacked variety You put me off with that at the Van Osburgh
weddingbut the plain English of it is that now youve got what you
wanted out of me youd rather have any other fellow about

His voice had risen sharply with the last words and Lily flushed with
annoyance but she kept command of the situation and laid a persuasive
hand on his arm

Dont be foolish Gus I cant let you talk to me in that ridiculous
way If you really want to see me why shouldnt we take a walk in the
Park some afternoon I agree with you that its amusing to be rustic in
town and if you like Ill meet you there and well go and feed the
squirrels and you shall take me out on the lake in the steamgondola

She smiled as she spoke letting her eyes rest on his in a way that took
the edge from her banter and made him suddenly malleable to her will

All right then thats a go Will you come tomorrow Tomorrow at three
oclock at the end of the Mall Ill be there sharp remember you wont
go back on me Lily

But to Miss Barts relief the repetition of her promise was cut short by
the opening of the box door to admit George Dorset

Trenor sulkily yielded his place and Lily turned a brilliant smile on
the newcomer She had not talked with Dorset since their visit at
Bellomont but something in his look and manner told her that he recalled
the friendly footing on which they had last met He was not a man to whom
the expression of admiration came easily his long sallow face and
distrustful eyes seemed always barricaded against the expansive emotions
But where her own influence was concerned Lilys intuitions sent out
threadlike feelers and as she made room for him on the narrow sofa she
was sure he found a dumb pleasure in being near her Few women took the
trouble to make themselves agreeable to Dorset and Lily had been kind to
him at Bellomont and was now smiling on him with a divine renewal of
kindness

Well here we are in for another six months of caterwauling he began
complainingly Not a shade of difference between this year and last
except that the women have got new clothes and the singers havent got
new voices My wifes musical you knowputs me through a course of this
every winter It isnt so bad on Italian nightsthen she comes late and
theres time to digest But when they give Wagner we have to rush
dinner and I pay up for it And the draughts are damnableasphyxia in
front and pleurisy in the back Theres Trenor leaving the box without
drawing the curtain With a hide like that draughts dont make any
difference Did you ever watch Trenor eat If you did youd wonder why
hes alive I suppose hes leather inside tooBut I came to say that my
wife wants you to come down to our place next Sunday Do for heavens
sake say yes Shes got a lot of bores comingintellectual ones I mean
thats her new line you know and Im not sure it aint worse than the
music Some of em have long hair and they start an argument with the
soup and dont notice when things are handed to them The consequence is
the dinner gets cold and I have dyspepsia That silly ass Silverton
brings them to the househe writes poetry you know and Bertha and he
are getting tremendously thick She could write better than any of em if
she chose and I dont blame her for wanting clever fellows about all I
say is Dont let me see em eat

The gist of this strange communication gave Lily a distinct thrill of
pleasure Under ordinary circumstances there would have been nothing
surprising in an invitation from Bertha Dorset but since the Bellomont
episode an unavowed hostility had kept the two women apart Now with a
start of inner wonder Lily felt that her thirst for retaliation had died
out IF YOU WOULD FORGIVE YOUR ENEMY says the Malay proverb FIRST
INFLICT A HURT ON HIM and Lily was experiencing the truth of the
apothegm If she had destroyed Mrs Dorsets letters she might have
continued to hate her but the fact that they remained in her possession
had fed her resentment to satiety

She uttered a smiling acceptance hailing in the renewal of the tie an
escape from Trenors importunities



Chapter 11

Meanwhile the holidays had gone by and the season was beginning Fifth
Avenue had become a nightly torrent of carriages surging upward to the
fashionable quarters about the Park where illuminated windows and
outspread awnings betokened the usual routine of hospitality Other
tributary currents crossed the mainstream bearing their freight to the
theatres restaurants or opera and Mrs Peniston from the secluded
watchtower of her upper window could tell to a nicety just when the
chronic volume of sound was increased by the sudden influx setting toward
a Van Osburgh ball or when the multiplication of wheels meant merely
that the opera was over or that there was a big supper at Sherrys

Mrs Peniston followed the rise and culmination of the season as keenly
as the most active sharer in its gaieties and as a lookeron she
enjoyed opportunities of comparison and generalization such as those who
take part must proverbially forego No one could have kept a more
accurate record of social fluctuations or have put a more unerring
finger on the distinguishing features of each season its dulness its
extravagance its lack of balls or excess of divorces She had a special
memory for the vicissitudes of the new people who rose to the surface
with each recurring tide and were either submerged beneath its rush or
landed triumphantly beyond the reach of envious breakers and she was apt
to display a remarkable retrospective insight into their ultimate fate
so that when they had fulfilled their destiny she was almost always
able to say to Grace Stepneythe recipient of her propheciesthat she
had known exactly what would happen

This particular season Mrs Peniston would have characterized as that in
which everybody felt poor except the Welly Brys and Mr Simon Rosedale
It had been a bad autumn in Wall Street where prices fell in accordance
with that peculiar law which proves railway stocks and bales of cotton to
be more sensitive to the allotment of executive power than many estimable
citizens trained to all the advantages of selfgovernment Even fortunes
supposed to be independent of the market either betrayed a secret
dependence on it or suffered from a sympathetic affection fashion
sulked in its country houses or came to town incognito general
entertainments were discountenanced and informality and short dinners
became the fashion

But society amused for a while at playing Cinderella soon wearied of
the hearthside role and welcomed the Fairy Godmother in the shape of any
magician powerful enough to turn the shrunken pumpkin back again into the
golden coach The mere fact of growing richer at a time when most
peoples investments are shrinking is calculated to attract envious
attention and according to Wall Street rumours Welly Bry and Rosedale
had found the secret of performing this miracle

Rosedale in particular was said to have doubled his fortune and there
was talk of his buying the newlyfinished house of one of the victims of
the crash who in the space of twelve short months had made the same
number of millions built a house in Fifth Avenue filled a
picturegallery with old masters entertained all New York in it and
been smuggled out of the country between a trained nurse and a doctor
while his creditors mounted guard over the old masters and his guests
explained to each other that they had dined with him only because they
wanted to see the pictures Mr Rosedale meant to have a less meteoric
career He knew he should have to go slowly and the instincts of his
race fitted him to suffer rebuffs and put up with delays But he was
prompt to perceive that the general dulness of the season afforded him an
unusual opportunity to shine and he set about with patient industry to
form a background for his growing glory Mrs Fisher was of immense
service to him at this period She had set off so many newcomers on the
social stage that she was like one of those pieces of stock scenery which
tell the experienced spectator exactly what is going to take place But
Mr Rosedale wanted in the long run a more individual environment He
was sensitive to shades of difference which Miss Bart would never have
credited him with perceiving because he had no corresponding variations
of manner and it was becoming more and more clear to him that Miss Bart
herself possessed precisely the complementary qualities needed to round
off his social personality

Such details did not fall within the range of Mrs Penistons vision
Like many minds of panoramic sweep hers was apt to overlook the MINUTIAE
of the foreground and she was much more likely to know where Carry
Fisher had found the Welly Brys CHEF for them than what was happening
to her own niece She was not however without purveyors of information
ready to supplement her deficiencies Grace Stepneys mind was like a
kind of moral flypaper to which the buzzing items of gossip were drawn
by a fatal attraction and where they hung fast in the toils of an
inexorable memory Lily would have been surprised to know how many
trivial facts concerning herself were lodged in Miss Stepneys head She
was quite aware that she was of interest to dingy people but she assumed
that there is only one form of dinginess and that admiration for
brilliancy is the natural expression of its inferior state She knew that
Gerty Farish admired her blindly and therefore supposed that she
inspired the same sentiments in Grace Stepney whom she classified as a
Gerty Farish without the saving traits of youth and enthusiasm

In reality the two differed from each other as much as they differed
from the object of their mutual contemplation Miss Farishs heart was a
fountain of tender illusions Miss Stepneys a precise register of facts
as manifested in their relation to herself She had sensibilities which
to Lily would have seemed comic in a person with a freckled nose and red
eyelids who lived in a boardinghouse and admired Mrs Penistons
drawingroom but poor Graces limitations gave them a more concentrated
inner life as poor soil starves certain plants into intenser
efflorescence She had in truth no abstract propensity to malice she did
not dislike Lily because the latter was brilliant and predominant but
because she thought that Lily disliked her It is less mortifying to
believe ones self unpopular than insignificant and vanity prefers to
assume that indifference is a latent form of unfriendliness Even such
scant civilities as Lily accorded to Mr Rosedale would have made Miss
Stepney her friend for life but how could she foresee that such a friend
was worth cultivating How moreover can a young woman who has never
been ignored measure the pang which this injury inflicts And lastly
how could Lily accustomed to choose between a pressure of engagements
guess that she had mortally offended Miss Stepney by causing her to be
excluded from one of Mrs Penistons infrequent dinnerparties

Mrs Peniston disliked giving dinners but she had a high sense of family
obligation and on the Jack Stepneys return from their honeymoon she
felt it incumbent upon her to light the drawingroom lamps and extract
her best silver from the Safe Deposit vaults Mrs Penistons rare
entertainments were preceded by days of heartrending vacillation as to
every detail of the feast from the seating of the guests to the pattern
of the tablecloth and in the course of one of these preliminary
discussions she had imprudently suggested to her cousin Grace that as
the dinner was a family affair she might be included in it For a week
the prospect had lighted up Miss Stepneys colourless existence then she
had been given to understand that it would be more convenient to have her
another day Miss Stepney knew exactly what had happened Lily to whom
family reunions were occasions of unalloyed dulness had persuaded her
aunt that a dinner of smart people would be much more to the taste of
the young couple and Mrs Peniston who leaned helplessly on her niece
in social matters had been prevailed upon to pronounce Graces exile
After all Grace could come any other day why should she mind being put
off

It was precisely because Miss Stepney could come any other dayand
because she knew her relations were in the secret of her unoccupied
eveningsthat this incident loomed gigantically on her horizon She was
aware that she had Lily to thank for it and dull resentment was turned
to active animosity

Mrs Peniston on whom she had looked in a day or two after the dinner
laid down her crochetwork and turned abruptly from her oblique survey of
Fifth Avenue

Gus TrenorLily and Gus Trenor she said growing so suddenly pale
that her visitor was almost alarmed

Oh cousin Julia    of course I dont mean   

I dont know what you DO mean said Mrs Peniston with a frightened
quiver in her small fretful voice Such things were never heard of in my
day And my own niece Im not sure I understand you Do people say hes
in love with her

Mrs Penistons horror was genuine Though she boasted an unequalled
familiarity with the secret chronicles of society she had the innocence
of the schoolgirl who regards wickedness as a part of history and to
whom it never occurs that the scandals she reads of in lessonhours may
be repeating themselves in the next street Mrs Peniston had kept her
imagination shrouded like the drawingroom furniture She knew of
course that society was very much changed and that many women her
mother would have thought peculiar were now in a position to be
critical about their visitinglists she had discussed the perils of
divorce with her rector and had felt thankful at times that Lily was
still unmarried but the idea that any scandal could attach to a young
girls name above all that it could be lightly coupled with that of a
married man was so new to her that she was as much aghast as if she had
been accused of leaving her carpets down all summer or of violating any
of the other cardinal laws of housekeeping

Miss Stepney when her first fright had subsided began to feel the
superiority that greater breadth of mind confers It was really pitiable
to be as ignorant of the world as Mrs Peniston She smiled at the
latters question People always say unpleasant thingsand certainly
theyre a great deal together A friend of mine met them the other
afternoon in the Parkquite late after the lamps were lit Its a pity
Lily makes herself so conspicuous

CONSPICUOUS gasped Mrs Peniston She bent forward lowering her voice
to mitigate the horror What sort of things do they say That he means
to get a divorce and marry her

Grace Stepney laughed outright Dear me no He would hardly do that
Itits a flirtationnothing more

A flirtation Between my niece and a married man Do you mean to tell me
that with Lilys looks and advantages she could find no better use for
her time than to waste it on a fat stupid man almost old enough to be her
father This argument had such a convincing ring that it gave Mrs
Peniston sufficient reassurance to pick up her work while she waited for
Grace Stepney to rally her scattered forces

But Miss Stepney was on the spot in an instant Thats the worst of
itpeople say she isnt wasting her time Every one knows as you say
that Lily is too handsome andand charmingto devote herself to a man
like Gus Trenor unless

Unless echoed Mrs Peniston Her visitor drew breath nervously It was
agreeable to shock Mrs Peniston but not to shock her to the verge of
anger Miss Stepney was not sufficiently familiar with the classic drama
to have recalled in advance how bearers of bad tidings are proverbially
received but she now had a rapid vision of forfeited dinners and a
reduced wardrobe as the possible consequence of her disinterestedness To
the honour of her sex however hatred of Lily prevailed over more
personal considerations Mrs Peniston had chosen the wrong moment to
boast of her nieces charms

Unless said Grace leaning forward to speak with lowtoned emphasis
unless there are material advantages to be gained by making herself
agreeable to him

She felt that the moment was tremendous and remembered suddenly that
Mrs Penistons black brocade with the cut jet fringe would have been
hers at the end of the season

Mrs Peniston put down her work again Another aspect of the same idea
had presented itself to her and she felt that it was beneath her dignity
to have her nerves racked by a dependent relative who wore her old
clothes

If you take pleasure in annoying me by mysterious insinuations she
said coldly you might at least have chosen a more suitable time than
just as I am recovering from the strain of giving a large dinner

The mention of the dinner dispelled Miss Stepneys last scruples I
dont know why I should be accused of taking pleasure in telling you
about Lily I was sure I shouldnt get any thanks for it she returned
with a flare of temper But I have some family feeling left and as you
are the only person who has any authority over Lily I thought you ought
to know what is being said of her

Well said Mrs Peniston what I complain of is that you havent told
me yet what IS being said

I didnt suppose I should have to put it so plainly People say that Gus
Trenor pays her bills

Pays her billsher bills Mrs Peniston broke into a laugh I cant
imagine where you can have picked up such rubbish Lily has her own
incomeand I provide for her very handsomely

Oh we all know that interposed Miss Stepney drily But Lily wears a
great many smart gowns

I like her to be welldressedits only suitable

Certainly but then there are her gambling debts besides

Miss Stepney in the beginning had not meant to bring up this point but
Mrs Peniston had only her own incredulity to blame She was like the
stiffnecked unbelievers of Scripture who must be annihilated to be
convinced

Gambling debts Lily Mrs Penistons voice shook with anger and
bewilderment She wondered whether Grace Stepney had gone out of her
mind What do you mean by her gambling debts

Simply that if one plays bridge for money in Lilys set one is liable to
lose a great dealand I dont suppose Lily always wins

Who told you that my niece played cards for money

Mercy cousin Julia dont look at me as if I were trying to turn you
against Lily Everybody knows she is crazy about bridge Mrs Gryce told
me herself that it was her gambling that frightened Percy Gryceit seems
he was really taken with her at first But of course among Lilys
friends its quite the custom for girls to play for money In fact
people are inclined to excuse her on that account

To excuse her for what

For being hard upand accepting attentions from men like Gus
Trenorand George Dorset

Mrs Peniston gave another cry George Dorset Is there any one else I
should like to know the worst if you please

Dont put it in that way cousin Julia Lately Lily has been a good deal
with the Dorsets and he seems to admire herbut of course thats only
natural And Im sure there is no truth in the horrid things people say
but she HAS been spending a great deal of money this winter Evie Van
Osburgh was at Celestes ordering her trousseau the other dayyes the
marriage takes place next monthand she told me that Celeste showed her
the most exquisite things she was just sending home to Lily And people
say that Judy Trenor has quarrelled with her on account of Gus but Im
sure Im sorry I spoke though I only meant it as a kindness

Mrs Penistons genuine incredulity enabled her to dismiss Miss Stepney
with a disdain which boded ill for that ladys prospect of succeeding to
the black brocade but minds impenetrable to reason have generally some
crack through which suspicion filters and her visitors insinuations did
not glide off as easily as she had expected Mrs Peniston disliked
scenes and her determination to avoid them had always led her to hold
herself aloof from the details of Lilys life In her youth girls had
not been supposed to require close supervision They were generally
assumed to be taken up with the legitimate business of courtship and
marriage and interference in such affairs on the part of their natural
guardians was considered as unwarrantable as a spectators suddenly
joining in a game There had of course been fast girls even in Mrs
Penistons early experience but their fastness at worst was understood
to be a mere excess of animal spirits against which there could be no
graver charge than that of being unladylike The modern fastness
appeared synonymous with immorality and the mere idea of immorality was
as offensive to Mrs Peniston as a smell of cooking in the drawingroom
it was one of the conceptions her mind refused to admit

She had no immediate intention of repeating to Lily what she had heard
or even of trying to ascertain its truth by means of discreet
interrogation To do so might be to provoke a scene and a scene in the
shaken state of Mrs Penistons nerves with the effects of her dinner
not worn off and her mind still tremulous with new impressions was a
risk she deemed it her duty to avoid But there remained in her thoughts
a settled deposit of resentment against her niece all the denser because
it was not to be cleared by explanation or discussion It was horrible
of a young girl to let herself be talked about however unfounded the
charges against her she must be to blame for their having been made
Mrs Peniston felt as if there had been a contagious illness in the
house and she was doomed to sit shivering among her contaminated
furniture



Chapter 12

Miss Bart had in fact been treading a devious way and none of her
critics could have been more alive to the fact than herself but she had
a fatalistic sense of being drawn from one wrong turning to another
without ever perceiving the right road till it was too late to take it

Lily who considered herself above narrow prejudices had not imagined
that the fact of letting Gus Trenor make a little money for her would
ever disturb her selfcomplacency And the fact in itself still seemed
harmless enough only it was a fertile source of harmful complications
As she exhausted the amusement of spending the money these complications
became more pressing and Lily whose mind could be severely logical in
tracing the causes of her illluck to others justified herself by the
thought that she owed all her troubles to the enmity of Bertha Dorset
This enmity however had apparently expired in a renewal of friendliness
between the two women Lilys visit to the Dorsets had resulted for
both in the discovery that they could be of use to each other and the
civilized instinct finds a subtler pleasure in making use of its
antagonist than in confounding him Mrs Dorset was in fact engaged in
a new sentimental experiment of which Mrs Fishers late property Ned
Silverton was the rosy victim and at such moments as Judy Trenor had
once remarked she felt a peculiar need of distracting her husbands
attention Dorset was as difficult to amuse as a savage but even his
selfengrossment was not proof against Lilys arts or rather these were
especially adapted to soothe an uneasy egoism Her experience with Percy
Gryce stood her in good stead in ministering to Dorsets humours and if
the incentive to please was less urgent the difficulties of her
situation were teaching her to make much of minor opportunities

Intimacy with the Dorsets was not likely to lessen such difficulties on
the material side Mrs Dorset had none of Judy Trenors lavish impulses
and Dorsets admiration was not likely to express itself in financial
tips even had Lily cared to renew her experiences in that line What
she required for the moment of the Dorsets friendship was simply its
social sanction She knew that people were beginning to talk of her but
this fact did not alarm her as it had alarmed Mrs Peniston In her set
such gossip was not unusual and a handsome girl who flirted with a
married man was merely assumed to be pressing to the limit of her
opportunities It was Trenor himself who frightened her Their walk in
the Park had not been a success Trenor had married young and since his
marriage his intercourse with women had not taken the form of the
sentimental smalltalk which doubles upon itself like the paths in a
maze He was first puzzled and then irritated to find himself always led
back to the same startingpoint and Lily felt that she was gradually
losing control of the situation Trenor was in truth in an unmanageable
mood In spite of his understanding with Rosedale he had been somewhat
heavily touched by the fall in stocks his household expenses weighed
on him and he seemed to be meeting on all sides a sullen opposition to
his wishes instead of the easy good luck he had hitherto encountered

Mrs Trenor was still at Bellomont keeping the townhouse open and
descending on it now and then for a taste of the world but preferring
the recurrent excitement of weekend parties to the restrictions of a
dull season Since the holidays she had not urged Lily to return to
Bellomont and the first time they met in town Lily fancied there was a
shade of coldness in her manner Was it merely the expression of her
displeasure at Miss Barts neglect or had disquieting rumours reached
her The latter contingency seemed improbable yet Lily was not without a
sense of uneasiness If her roaming sympathies had struck root anywhere
it was in her friendship with Judy Trenor She believed in the sincerity
of her friends affection though it sometimes showed itself in
selfinterested ways and she shrank with peculiar reluctance from any
risk of estranging it But aside from this she was keenly conscious of
the way in which such an estrangement would react on herself The fact
that Gus Trenor was Judys husband was at times Lilys strongest reason
for disliking him and for resenting the obligation under which he had
placed her To set her doubts at rest Miss Bart soon after the New
Year proposed herself for a weekend at Bellomont She had learned in
advance that the presence of a large party would protect her from too
great assiduity on Trenors part and his wifes telegraphic come by all
means seemed to assure her of her usual welcome

Judy received her amicably The cares of a large party always prevailed
over personal feelings and Lily saw no change in her hostesss manner
Nevertheless she was soon aware that the experiment of coming to
Bellomont was destined not to be successful The party was made up of
what Mrs Trenor called poky peopleher generic name for persons who
did not play bridgeand it being her habit to group all such
obstructionists in one class she usually invited them together
regardless of their other characteristics The result was apt to be an
irreducible combination of persons having no other quality in common than
their abstinence from bridge and the antagonisms developed in a group
lacking the one taste which might have amalgamated them were in this
case aggravated by bad weather and by the illconcealed boredom of their
host and hostess In such emergencies Judy would usually have turned to
Lily to fuse the discordant elements and Miss Bart assuming that such a
service was expected of her threw herself into it with her accustomed
zeal But at the outset she perceived a subtle resistance to her efforts
If Mrs Trenors manner toward her was unchanged there was certainly a
faint coldness in that of the other ladies An occasional caustic
allusion to your friends the Wellington Brys or to the little Jew who
has bought the Greiner housesome one told us you knew him Miss
Bartshowed Lily that she was in disfavour with that portion of
society which while contributing least to its amusement has assumed the
right to decide what forms that amusement shall take The indication was
a slight one and a year ago Lily would have smiled at it trusting to
the charm of her personality to dispel any prejudice against her But now
she had grown more sensitive to criticism and less confident in her power
of disarming it She knew moreover that if the ladies at Bellomont
permitted themselves to criticize her friends openly it was a proof that
they were not afraid of subjecting her to the same treatment behind her
back The nervous dread lest anything in Trenors manner should seem to
justify their disapproval made her seek every pretext for avoiding him
and she left Bellomont conscious of having failed in every purpose which
had taken her there

In town she returned to preoccupations which for the moment had the
happy effect of banishing troublesome thoughts The Welly Brys after
much debate and anxious counsel with their newly acquired friends had
decided on the bold move of giving a general entertainment To attack
society collectively when ones means of approach are limited to a few
acquaintances is like advancing into a strange country with an
insufficient number of scouts but such rash tactics have sometimes led
to brilliant victories and the Brys had determined to put their fate to
the touch Mrs Fisher to whom they had entrusted the conduct of the
affair had decided that TABLEAUX VIVANTS and expensive music were the
two baits most likely to attract the desired prey and after prolonged
negotiations and the kind of wirepulling in which she was known to
excel she had induced a dozen fashionable women to exhibit themselves in
a series of pictures which by a farther miracle of persuasion the
distinguished portrait painter Paul Morpeth had been prevailed upon to
organize

Lily was in her element on such occasions Under Morpeths guidance her
vivid plastic sense hitherto nurtured on no higher food than
dressmaking and upholstery found eager expression in the disposal of
draperies the study of attitudes the shifting of lights and shadows
Her dramatic instinct was roused by the choice of subjects and the
gorgeous reproductions of historic dress stirred an imagination which
only visual impressions could reach But keenest of all was the
exhilaration of displaying her own beauty under a new aspect of showing
that her loveliness was no mere fixed quality but an element shaping all
emotions to fresh forms of grace

Mrs Fishers measures had been welltaken and society surprised in a
dull moment succumbed to the temptation of Mrs Brys hospitality The
protesting minority were forgotten in the throng which abjured and came
and the audience was almost as brilliant as the show

Lawrence Selden was among those who had yielded to the proffered
inducements If he did not often act on the accepted social axiom that a
man may go where he pleases it was because he had long since learned
that his pleasures were mainly to be found in a small group of the
likeminded But he enjoyed spectacular effects and was not insensible
to the part money plays in their production all he asked was that the
very rich should live up to their calling as stagemanagers and not
spend their money in a dull way This the Brys could certainly not be
charged with doing Their recently built house whatever it might lack as
a frame for domesticity was almost as welldesigned for the display of a
festal assemblage as one of those airy pleasurehalls which the Italian
architects improvised to set off the hospitality of princes The air of
improvisation was in fact strikingly present so recent so
rapidlyevoked was the whole MISEENSCENE that one had to touch the
marble columns to learn they were not of cardboard to seat ones self in
one of the damaskandgold armchairs to be sure it was not painted
against the wall

Selden who had put one of these seats to the test found himself from
an angle of the ballroom surveying the scene with frank enjoyment The
company in obedience to the decorative instinct which calls for fine
clothes in fine surroundings had dressed rather with an eye to Mrs
Brys background than to herself The seated throng filling the immense
room without undue crowding presented a surface of rich tissues and
jewelled shoulders in harmony with the festooned and gilded walls and
the flushed splendours of the Venetian ceiling At the farther end of the
room a stage had been constructed behind a proscenium arch curtained with
folds of old damask but in the pause before the parting of the folds
there was little thought of what they might reveal for every woman who
had accepted Mrs Brys invitation was engaged in trying to find out how
many of her friends had done the same

Gerty Farish seated next to Selden was lost in that indiscriminate and
uncritical enjoyment so irritating to Miss Barts finer perceptions It
may be that Seldens nearness had something to do with the quality of his
cousins pleasure but Miss Farish was so little accustomed to refer her
enjoyment of such scenes to her own share in them that she was merely
conscious of a deeper sense of contentment

Wasnt it dear of Lily to get me an invitation Of course it would never
have occurred to Carry Fisher to put me on the list and I should have
been so sorry to miss seeing it alland especially Lily herself Some
one told me the ceiling was by Veroneseyou would know of course
Lawrence I suppose its very beautiful but his women are so dreadfully
fat Goddesses Well I can only say that if theyd been mortals and had
to wear corsets it would have been better for them I think our women
are much handsomer And this room is wonderfully becomingevery one
looks so well Did you ever see such jewels Do look at Mrs George
Dorsets pearlsI suppose the smallest of them would pay the rent of our
Girls Club for a year Not that I ought to complain about the club
every one has been so wonderfully kind Did I tell you that Lily had
given us three hundred dollars Wasnt it splendid of her And then she
collected a lot of money from her friendsMrs Bry gave us five hundred
and Mr Rosedale a thousand I wish Lily were not so nice to Mr
Rosedale but she says its no use being rude to him because he doesnt
see the difference She really cant bear to hurt peoples feelingsit
makes me so angry when I hear her called cold and conceited The girls at
the club dont call her that Do you know she has been there with me
twiceyes Lily And you should have seen their eyes One of them said
it was as good as a day in the country just to look at her And she sat
there and laughed and talked with themnot a bit as if she were being
CHARITABLE you know but as if she liked it as much as they did Theyve
been asking ever since when shes coming back and shes promised
meoh

Miss Farishs confidences were cut short by the parting of the curtain on
the first TABLEAUa group of nymphs dancing across flowerstrewn sward
in the rhythmic postures of Botticellis Spring TABLEAUX VIVANTS depend
for their effect not only on the happy disposal of lights and the
delusiveinterposition of layers of gauze but on a corresponding
adjustment of the mental vision To unfurnished minds they remain in
spite of every enhancement of art only a superior kind of waxworks but
to the responsive fancy they may give magic glimpses of the boundary
world between fact and imagination Seldens mind was of this order he
could yield to visionmaking influences as completely as a child to the
spell of a fairytale Mrs Brys TABLEAUX wanted none of the qualities
which go to the producing of such illusions and under Morpeths
organizing hand the pictures succeeded each other with the rhythmic march
of some splendid frieze in which the fugitive curves of living flesh and
the wandering light of young eyes have been subdued to plastic harmony
without losing the charm of life

The scenes were taken from old pictures and the participators had been
cleverly fitted with characters suited to their types No one for
instance could have made a more typical Goya than Carry Fisher with her
short darkskinned face the exaggerated glow of her eyes the
provocation of her franklypainted smile A brilliant Miss Smedden from
Brooklyn showed to perfection the sumptuous curves of Titians Daughter
lifting her gold salver laden with grapes above the harmonizing gold of
rippled hair and rich brocade and a young Mrs Van Alstyne who showed
the frailer Dutch type with high blueveined forehead and pale eyes and
lashes made a characteristic Vandyck in black satin against a
curtained archway Then there were Kauffmann nymphs garlanding the altar
of Love a Veronese supper all sheeny textures pearlwoven heads and
marble architecture and a Watteau group of luteplaying comedians
lounging by a fountain in a sunlit glade

Each evanescent picture touched the visionbuilding faculty in Selden
leading him so far down the vistas of fancy that even Gerty Farishs
running commentaryOh how lovely Lulu Melson looks or That must be
Kate Corby to the right there in purpledid not break the spell of
the illusion Indeed so skilfully had the personality of the actors been
subdued to the scenes they figured in that even the least imaginative of
the audience must have felt a thrill of contrast when the curtain
suddenly parted on a picture which was simply and undisguisedly the
portrait of Miss Bart

Here there could be no mistaking the predominance of personalitythe
unanimous Oh of the spectators was a tribute not to the brushwork of
Reynoldss Mrs Lloyd but to the flesh and blood loveliness of Lily
Bart She had shown her artistic intelligence in selecting a type so like
her own that she could embody the person represented without ceasing to
be herself It was as though she had stepped not out of but into
Reynoldss canvas banishing the phantom of his dead beauty by the beams
of her living grace The impulse to show herself in a splendid
settingshe had thought for a moment of representing Tiepolos
Cleopatrahad yielded to the truer instinct of trusting to her
unassisted beauty and she had purposely chosen a picture without
distracting accessories of dress or surroundings Her pale draperies
and the background of foliage against which she stood served only to
relieve the long dryadlike curves that swept upward from her poised foot
to her lifted arm The noble buoyancy of her attitude its suggestion of
soaring grace revealed the touch of poetry in her beauty that Selden
always felt in her presence yet lost the sense of when he was not with
her Its expression was now so vivid that for the first time he seemed to
see before him the real Lily Bart divested of the trivialities of her
little world and catching for a moment a note of that eternal harmony of
which her beauty was a part

Deuced bold thing to show herself in that getup but gad there isnt
a break in the lines anywhere and I suppose she wanted us to know it

These words uttered by that experienced connoisseur Mr Ned Van
Alstyne whose scented white moustache had brushed Seldens shoulder
whenever the parting of the curtains presented any exceptional
opportunity for the study of the female outline affected their hearer in
an unexpected way It was not the first time that Selden had heard Lilys
beauty lightly remarked on and hitherto the tone of the comments had
imperceptibly coloured his view of her But now it woke only a motion of
indignant contempt This was the world she lived in these were the
standards by which she was fated to be measured Does one go to Caliban
for a judgment on Miranda

In the long moment before the curtain fell he had time to feel the whole
tragedy of her life It was as though her beauty thus detached from all
that cheapened and vulgarized it had held out suppliant hands to him
from the world in which he and she had once met for a moment and where
he felt an overmastering longing to be with her again

He was roused by the pressure of ecstatic fingers Wasnt she too
beautiful Lawrence Dont you like her best in that simple dress It
makes her look like the real Lilythe Lily I know

He met Gerty Farishs brimming gaze The Lily we know he corrected
and his cousin beaming at the implied understanding exclaimed joyfully
Ill tell her that She always says you dislike her

The performance over Seldens first impulse was to seek Miss Bart
During the interlude of music which succeeded the TABLEAUX the actors
had seated themselves here and there in the audience diversifying its
conventional appearance by the varied picturesqueness of their dress
Lily however was not among them and her absence served to protract the
effect she had produced on Selden it would have broken the spell to see
her too soon in the surroundings from which accident had so happily
detached her They had not met since the day of the Van Osburgh wedding
and on his side the avoidance had been intentional Tonight however he
knew that sooner or later he should find himself at her side and
though he let the dispersing crowd drift him whither it would without
making an immediate effort to reach her his procrastination was not due
to any lingering resistance but to the desire to luxuriate a moment in
the sense of complete surrender

Lily had not an instants doubt as to the meaning of the murmur greeting
her appearance No other tableau had been received with that precise note
of approval it had obviously been called forth by herself and not by
the picture she impersonated She had feared at the last moment that she
was risking too much in dispensing with the advantages of a more
sumptuous setting and the completeness of her triumph gave her an
intoxicating sense of recovered power Not caring to diminish the
impression she had produced she held herself aloof from the audience
till the movement of dispersal before supper and thus had a second
opportunity of showing herself to advantage as the throng poured slowly
into the empty drawingroom where she was standing

She was soon the centre of a group which increased and renewed itself as
the circulation became general and the individual comments on her
success were a delightful prolongation of the collective applause At
such moments she lost something of her natural fastidiousness and cared
less for the quality of the admiration received than for its quantity
Differences of personality were merged in a warm atmosphere of praise in
which her beauty expanded like a flower in sunlight and if Selden had
approached a moment or two sooner he would have seen her turning on Ned
Van Alstyne and George Dorset the look he had dreamed of capturing for
himself

Fortune willed however that the hurried approach of Mrs Fisher as
whose aidedecamp Van Alstyne was acting should break up the group
before Selden reached the threshold of the room One or two of the men
wandered off in search of their partners for supper and the others
noticing Seldens approach gave way to him in accordance with the tacit
freemasonry of the ballroom Lily was therefore standing alone when he
reached her and finding the expected look in her eye he had the
satisfaction of supposing he had kindled it The look did indeed deepen
as it rested on him for even in that moment of selfintoxication Lily
felt the quicker beat of life that his nearness always produced She
read too in his answering gaze the delicious confirmation of her
triumph and for the moment it seemed to her that it was for him only she
cared to be beautiful

Selden had given her his arm without speaking She took it in silence
and they moved away not toward the supperroom but against the tide
which was setting thither The faces about her flowed by like the
streaming images of sleep she hardly noticed where Selden was leading
her till they passed through a glass doorway at the end of the long
suite of rooms and stood suddenly in the fragrant hush of a garden
Gravel grated beneath their feet and about them was the transparent
dimness of a midsummer night Hanging lights made emerald caverns in the
depths of foliage and whitened the spray of a fountain falling among
lilies The magic place was deserted there was no sound but the splash
of the water on the lilypads and a distant drift of music that might
have been blown across a sleeping lake

Selden and Lily stood still accepting the unreality of the scene as a
part of their own dreamlike sensations It would not have surprised them
to feel a summer breeze on their faces or to see the lights among the
boughs reduplicated in the arch of a starry sky The strange solitude
about them was no stranger than the sweetness of being alone in it
together At length Lily withdrew her hand and moved away a step so
that her whiterobed slimness was outlined against the dusk of the
branches Selden followed her and still without speaking they seated
themselves on a bench beside the fountain

Suddenly she raised her eyes with the beseeching earnestness of a child
You never speak to meyou think hard things of me she murmured

I think of you at any rate God knows he said

Then why do we never see each other Why cant we be friends You
promised once to help me she continued in the same tone as though the
words were drawn from her unwillingly

The only way I can help you is by loving you Selden said in a low
voice

She made no reply but her face turned to him with the soft motion of a
flower His own met it slowly and their lips touched She drew back and
rose from her seat Selden rose too and they stood facing each other
Suddenly she caught his hand and pressed it a moment against her cheek

Ah love me love mebut dont tell me so she sighed with her eyes in
his and before he could speak she had turned and slipped through the
arch of boughs disappearing in the brightness of the room beyond

Selden stood where she had left him He knew too well the transiency of
exquisite moments to attempt to follow her but presently he reentered
the house and made his way through the deserted rooms to the door A few
sumptuouslycloaked ladies were already gathered in the marble vestibule
and in the coatroom he found Van Alstyne and Gus Trenor

The former at Seldens approach paused in the careful selection of a
cigar from one of the silver boxes invitingly set out near the door

Hallo Selden going too Youre an Epicurean like myself I see you
dont want to see all those goddesses gobbling terrapin Gad what a
show of goodlooking women but not one of em could touch that little
cousin of mine Talk of jewelswhats a woman want with jewels when
shes got herself to show The trouble is that all these falbals they
wear cover up their figures when theyve got em I never knew till
tonight what an outline Lily has

Its not her fault if everybody dont know it now growled Trenor
flushed with the struggle of getting into his furlined coat Damned bad
taste I call itno no cigar for me You cant tell what youre smoking
in one of these new houseslikely as not the CHEF buys the cigars Stay
for supper Not if I know it When people crowd their rooms so that you
cant get near any one you want to speak to Id as soon sup in the
elevated at the rush hour My wife was dead right to stay away she says
lifes too short to spend it in breaking in new people



Chapter 13

Lily woke from happy dreams to find two notes at her bedside

One was from Mrs Trenor who announced that she was coming to town that
afternoon for a flying visit and hoped Miss Bart would be able to dine
with her The other was from Selden He wrote briefly that an important
case called him to Albany whence he would be unable to return till the
evening and asked Lily to let him know at what hour on the following day
she would see him

Lily leaning back among her pillows gazed musingly at his letter The
scene in the Brys conservatory had been like a part of her dreams she
had not expected to wake to such evidence of its reality Her first
movement was one of annoyance this unforeseen act of Seldens added
another complication to life It was so unlike him to yield to such an
irrational impulse Did he really mean to ask her to marry him She had
once shown him the impossibility of such a hope and his subsequent
behaviour seemed to prove that he had accepted the situation with a
reasonableness somewhat mortifying to her vanity It was all the more
agreeable to find that this reasonableness was maintained only at the
cost of not seeing her but though nothing in life was as sweet as the
sense of her power over him she saw the danger of allowing the episode
of the previous night to have a sequel Since she could not marry him it
would be kinder to him as well as easier for herself to write a line
amicably evading his request to see her he was not the man to mistake
such a hint and when next they met it would be on their usual friendly
footing

Lily sprang out of bed and went straight to her desk She wanted to
write at once while she could trust to the strength of her resolve She
was still languid from her brief sleep and the exhilaration of the
evening and the sight of Seldens writing brought back the culminating
moment of her triumph the moment when she had read in his eyes that no
philosophy was proof against her power It would be pleasant to have that
sensation again    no one else could give it to her in its fulness
and she could not bear to mar her mood of luxurious retrospection by an
act of definite refusal She took up her pen and wrote hastily TOMORROW
AT FOUR murmuring to herself as she slipped the sheet into its
envelope I can easily put him off when tomorrow comes



Judy Trenors summons was very welcome to Lily It was the first time she
had received a direct communication from Bellomont since the close of her
last visit there and she was still visited by the dread of having
incurred Judys displeasure But this characteristic command seemed to
reestablish their former relations and Lily smiled at the thought that
her friend had probably summoned her in order to hear about the Brys
entertainment Mrs Trenor had absented herself from the feast perhaps
for the reason so frankly enunciated by her husband perhaps because as
Mrs Fisher somewhat differently put it she couldnt bear new people
when she hadnt discovered them herself At any rate though she
remained haughtily at Bellomont Lily suspected in her a devouring
eagerness to hear of what she had missed and to learn exactly in what
measure Mrs Wellington Bry had surpassed all previous competitors for
social recognition Lily was quite ready to gratify this curiosity but
it happened that she was dining out She determined however to see Mrs
Trenor for a few moments and ringing for her maid she despatched a
telegram to say that she would be with her friend that evening at ten

She was dining with Mrs Fisher who had gathered at an informal feast a
few of the performers of the previous evening There was to be plantation
music in the studio after dinnerfor Mrs Fisher despairing of the
republic had taken up modelling and annexed to her small crowded house
a spacious apartment which whatever its uses in her hours of plastic
inspiration served at other times for the exercise of an indefatigable
hospitality Lily was reluctant to leave for the dinner was amusing and
she would have liked to lounge over a cigarette and hear a few songs but
she could not break her engagement with Judy and shortly after ten she
asked her hostess to ring for a hansom and drove up Fifth Avenue to the
Trenors

She waited long enough on the doorstep to wonder that Judys presence in
town was not signalized by a greater promptness in admitting her and her
surprise was increased when instead of the expected footman pushing his
shoulders into a tardy coat a shabby caretaking person in calico let
her into the shrouded hall Trenor however appeared at once on the
threshold of the drawingroom welcoming her with unusual volubility
while he relieved her of her cloak and drew her into the room

Come along to the den its the only comfortable place in the house
Doesnt this room look as if it was waiting for the body to be brought
down Cant see why Judy keeps the house wrapped up in this awful
slippery white stuffits enough to give a fellow pneumonia to walk
through these rooms on a cold day You look a little pinched yourself by
the way its rather a sharp night out I noticed it walking up from the
club Come along and Ill give you a nip of brandy and you can toast
yourself over the fire and try some of my new Egyptiansthat little
Turkish chap at the Embassy put me on to a brand that I want you to try
and if you like em Ill get out a lot for you they dont have em here
yet but Ill cable

He led her through the house to the large room at the back where Mrs
Trenor usually sat and where even in her absence there was an air of
occupancy Here as usual were flowers newspapers a littered
writingtable and a general aspect of lamplit familiarity so that it
was a surprise not to see Judys energetic figure start up from the
armchair near the fire

It was apparently Trenor himself who had been occupying the seat in
question for it was overhung by a cloud of cigar smoke and near it
stood one of those intricate folding tables which British ingenuity has
devised to facilitate the circulation of tobacco and spirits The sight
of such appliances in a drawingroom was not unusual in Lilys set where
smoking and drinking were unrestricted by considerations of time and
place and her first movement was to help herself to one of the
cigarettes recommended by Trenor while she checked his loquacity by
asking with a surprised glance Wheres Judy

Trenor a little heated by his unusual flow of words and perhaps by
prolonged propinquity with the decanters was bending over the latter to
decipher their silver labels

Here now Lily just a drop of cognac in a little fizzy wateryou do
look pinched you know I swear the end of your nose is red Ill take
another glass to keep you companyJudyWhy you see Judys got a
devil of a head achequite knocked out with it poor thingshe asked me
to explainmake it all right you knowDo come up to the fire though
you look deadbeat really Now do let me make you comfortable theres a
good girl

He had taken her hand halfbanteringly and was drawing her toward a low
seat by the hearth but she stopped and freed herself quietly

Do you mean to say that Judys not well enough to see me Doesnt she
want me to go upstairs

Trenor drained the glass he had filled for himself and paused to set it
down before he answered

Why nothe fact is shes not up to seeing anybody It came on
suddenly you know and she asked me to tell you how awfully sorry she
wasif shed known where you were dining shed have sent you word

She did know where I was dining I mentioned it in my telegram But it
doesnt matter of course I suppose if shes so poorly she wont go back
to Bellomont in the morning and I can come and see her then

Yes exactlythats capital Ill tell her youll pop in tomorrow
morning And now do sit down a minute theres a dear and lets have a
nice quiet jaw together You wont take a drop just for sociability
Tell me what you think of that cigarette Why dont you like it What
are you chucking it away for

I am chucking it away because I must go if youll have the goodness to
call a cab for me Lily returned with a smile

She did not like Trenors unusual excitability with its too evident
explanation and the thought of being alone with him with her friend out
of reach upstairs at the other end of the great empty house did not
conduce to a desire to prolong their TETEATETE

But Trenor with a promptness which did not escape her had moved between
herself and the door

Why must you go I should like to know If Judyd been here youd have
sat gossiping till all hoursand you cant even give me five minutes
Its always the same story Last night I couldnt get near youI went to
that damned vulgar party just to see you and there was everybody talking
about you and asking me if Id ever seen anything so stunning and when
I tried to come up and say a word you never took any notice but just
went on laughing and joking with a lot of asses who only wanted to be
able to swagger about afterward and look knowing when you were
mentioned

He paused flushed by his diatribe and fixing on her a look in which
resentment was the ingredient she least disliked But she had regained
her presence of mind and stood composedly in the middle of the room
while her slight smile seemed to put an ever increasing distance between
herself and Trenor

Across it she said Dont be absurd Gus Its past eleven and I must
really ask you to ring for a cab

He remained immovable with the lowering forehead she had grown to detest

And supposing I wont ring for onewhatll you do then

I shall go upstairs to Judy if you force me to disturb her

Trenor drew a step nearer and laid his hand on her arm Look here Lily
wont you give me five minutes of your own accord

Not tonight Gus you

Very good then Ill take em And as many more as I want He had
squared himself on the threshold his hands thrust deep in his pockets
He nodded toward the chair on the hearth

Go and sit down there please Ive got a word to say to you

Lilys quick temper was getting the better of her fears She drew herself
up and moved toward the door

If you have anything to say to me you must say it another time I
shall go up to Judy unless you call a cab for me at once

He burst into a laugh Go upstairs and welcome my dear but you wont
find Judy She aint there

Lily cast a startled look upon him Do you mean that Judy is not in the
housenot in town she exclaimed

Thats just what I do mean returned Trenor his bluster sinking to
sullenness under her look

NonsenseI dont believe you I am going upstairs she said
impatiently

He drew unexpectedly aside letting her reach the threshold unimpeded

Go up and welcome but my wife is at Bellomont

But Lily had a flash of reassurance If she hadnt come she would have
sent me word

She did she telephoned me this afternoon to let you know

I received no message

I didnt send any

The two measured each other for a moment but Lily still saw her opponent
through a blur of scorn that made all other considerations indistinct

I cant imagine your object in playing such a stupid trick on me but if
you have fully gratified your peculiar sense of humour I must again ask
you to send for a cab

It was the wrong note and she knew it as she spoke To be stung by irony
it is not necessary to understand it and the angry streaks on Trenors
face might have been raised by an actual lash

Look here Lily dont take that high and mighty tone with me He had
again moved toward the door and in her instinctive shrinking from him
she let him regain command of the threshold I DID play a trick on you
I own up to it but if you think Im ashamed youre mistaken Lord knows
Ive been patient enoughIve hung round and looked like an ass And
all the while you were letting a lot of other fellows make up to
you    letting em make fun of me I daresay    Im not sharp and
cant dress my friends up to look funny as you do    but I can tell
when its being done to me    I can tell fast enough when Im made a
fool of   

Ah I shouldnt have thought that flashed from Lily but her laugh
dropped to silence under his look

No you wouldnt have thought it but youll know better now Thats
what youre here for tonight Ive been waiting for a quiet time to talk
things over and now Ive got it I mean to make you hear me out

His first rush of inarticulate resentment had been followed by a
steadiness and concentration of tone more disconcerting to Lily than the
excitement preceding it For a moment her presence of mind forsook her
She had more than once been in situations where a quick swordplay of wit
had been needful to cover her retreat but her frightened heartthrobs
told her that here such skill would not avail

To gain time she repeated I dont understand what you want

Trenor had pushed a chair between herself and the door He threw himself
in it and leaned back looking up at her

Ill tell you what I want I want to know just where you and I stand
Hang it the man who pays for the dinner is generally allowed to have a
seat at table

She flamed with anger and abasement and the sickening need of having to
conciliate where she longed to humble

I dont know what you meanbut you must see Gus that I cant stay
here talking to you at this hour

Gad you go to mens houses fast enough in broad day lightstrikes me
youre not always so deuced careful of appearances

The brutality of the thrust gave her the sense of dizziness that follows
on a physical blow Rosedale had spoken thenthis was the way men talked
of herShe felt suddenly weak and defenceless there was a throb of
selfpity in her throat But all the while another self was sharpening
her to vigilance whispering the terrified warning that every word and
gesture must be measured

If you have brought me here to say insulting things she began

Trenor laughed Dont talk stagerot I dont want to insult you But a
mans got his feelingsand youve played with mine too long I didnt
begin this businesskept out of the way and left the track clear for
the other chaps till you rummaged me out and set to work to make an ass
of meand an easy job you had of it too Thats the troubleit was too
easy for youyou got recklessthought you could turn me inside out and
chuck me in the gutter like an empty purse But by gad that aint
playing fair thats dodging the rules of the game Of course I know now
what you wantedit wasnt my beautiful eyes you were afterbut I tell
you what Miss Lily youve got to pay up for making me think so

He rose squaring his shoulders aggressively and stepped toward her with
a reddening brow but she held her footing though every nerve tore at
her to retreat as he advanced

Pay up she faltered Do you mean that I owe you money

He laughed again Oh Im not asking for payment in kind But theres
such a thing as fair playand interest on ones moneyand hang me if
Ive had as much as a look from you

Your money What have I to do with your money You advised me how to
invest mine    you must have seen I knew nothing of business   
you told me it was all right

It WAS all rightit is Lily youre welcome to all of it and ten
times more Im only asking for a word of thanks from you He was closer
still with a hand that grew formidable and the frightened self in her
was dragging the other down

I HAVE thanked you Ive shown I was grateful What more have you done
than any friend might do or any one accept from a friend

Trenor caught her up with a sneer I dont doubt youve accepted as much
beforeand chucked the other chaps as youd like to chuck me I dont
care how you settled your score with themif you fooled em Im that
much to the good Dont stare at me like thatI know Im not talking the
way a man is supposed to talk to a girlbut hang it if you dont like
it you can stop me quick enoughyou know Im mad about youdamn the
money theres plenty more of itif THAT bothers you    I was a
brute LilyLilyjust look at me

Over and over her the sea of humiliation brokewave crashing on wave so
close that the moral shame was one with the physical dread It seemed to
her that selfesteem would have made her invulnerablethat it was her
own dishonour which put a fearful solitude about her

His touch was a shock to her drowning consciousness She drew back from
him with a desperate assumption of scorn

Ive told you I dont understandbut if I owe you money you shall be
paid

Trenors face darkened to rage her recoil of abhorrence had called out
the primitive man

Ahyoull borrow from Selden or Rosedaleand take your chances of
fooling them as youve fooled me Unlessunless youve settled your
other scores alreadyand Im the only one left out in the cold

She stood silent frozen to her place The wordsthe words were worse
than the touch Her heart was beating all over her bodyin her throat
her limbs her helpless useless hands Her eyes travelled despairingly
about the roomthey lit on the bell and she remembered that help was in
call Yes but scandal with ita hideous mustering of tongues No she
must fight her way out alone It was enough that the servants knew her to
be in the house with Trenorthere must be nothing to excite conjecture
in her way of leaving it

She raised her head and achieved a last clear look at him

I am here alone with you she said What more have you to say

To her surprise Trenor answered the look with a speechless stare With
his last gust of words the flame had died out leaving him chill and
humbled It was as though a cold air had dispersed the fumes of his
libations and the situation loomed before him black and naked as the
ruins of a fire Old habits old restraints the hand of inherited order
plucked back the bewildered mind which passion had jolted from its ruts
Trenors eye had the haggard look of the sleepwalker waked on a deathly
ledge

Go home Go away from herehe stammered and turning his back on her
walked toward the hearth

The sharp release from her fears restored Lily to immediate lucidity
The collapse of Trenors will left her in control and she heard herself
in a voice that was her own yet outside herself bidding him ring for the
servant bidding him give the order for a hansom directing him to put
her in it when it came Whence the strength came to her she knew not but
an insistent voice warned her that she must leave the house openly and
nerved her in the hall before the hovering care taker to exchange light
words with Trenor and charge him with the usual messages for Judy while
all the while she shook with inward loathing On the doorstep with the
street before her she felt a mad throb of liberation intoxicating as
the prisoners first draught of free air but the clearness of brain
continued and she noted the mute aspect of Fifth Avenue guessed at the
lateness of the hour and even observed a mans figurewas there
something halffamiliar in its outlinewhich as she entered the
hansom turned from the opposite corner and vanished in the obscurity of
the side street

But with the turn of the wheels reaction came and shuddering darkness
closed on her I cant thinkI cant think she moaned and leaned her
head against the rattling side of the cab She seemed a stranger to
herself or rather there were two selves in her the one she had always
known and a new abhorrent being to which it found itself chained She
had once picked up in a house where she was staying a translation of
the EUMENIDES and her imagination had been seized by the high terror of
the scene where Orestes in the cave of the oracle finds his implacable
huntresses asleep and snatches an hours repose Yes the Furies might
sometimes sleep but they were there always there in the dark corners
and now they were awake and the iron clang of their wings was in her
brain    She opened her eyes and saw the streets passingthe familiar
alien streets All she looked on was the same and yet changed There was
a great gulf fixed between today and yesterday Everything in the past
seemed simple natural full of daylightand she was alone in a place of
darkness and pollutionAlone It was the loneliness that frightened
her Her eyes fell on an illuminated clock at a street corner and she
saw that the hands marked the half hour after eleven Only halfpast
eleventhere were hours and hours left of the night And she must spend
them alone shuddering sleepless on her bed Her soft nature recoiled
from this ordeal which had none of the stimulus of conflict to goad her
through it Oh the slow cold drip of the minutes on her head She had a
vision of herself lying on the black walnut bedand the darkness would
frighten her and if she left the light burning the dreary details of the
room would brand themselves forever on her brain She had always hated
her room at Mrs Penistonsits ugliness its impersonality the fact
that nothing in it was really hers To a torn heart uncomforted by human
nearness a room may open almost human arms and the being to whom no four
walls mean more than any others is at such hours expatriate everywhere

Lily had no heart to lean on Her relation with her aunt was as
superficial as that of chance lodgers who pass on the stairs But even
had the two been in closer contact it was impossible to think of Mrs
Penistons mind as offering shelter or comprehension to such misery as
Lilys As the pain that can be told is but half a pain so the pity that
questions has little healing in its touch What Lily craved was the
darkness made by enfolding arms the silence which is not solitude but
compassion holding its breath

She started up and looked forth on the passing streets Gertythey
were nearing Gertys corner If only she could reach there before this
labouring anguish burst from her breast to her lipsif only she could
feel the hold of Gertys arms while she shook in the aguefit of fear
that was coming upon her She pushed up the door in the roof and called
the address to the driver It was not so lateGerty might still be
waking And even if she were not the sound of the bell would penetrate
every recess of her tiny apartment and rouse her to answer her friends
call



Chapter 14

Gerty Farish the morning after the Wellington Brys entertainment woke
from dreams as happy as Lilys If they were less vivid in hue more
subdued to the halftints of her personality and her experience they
were for that very reason better suited to her mental vision Such
flashes of joy as Lily moved in would have blinded Miss Farish who was
accustomed in the way of happiness to such scant light as shone through
the cracks of other peoples lives

Now she was the centre of a little illumination of her own a mild but
unmistakable beam compounded of Lawrence Seldens growing kindness to
herself and the discovery that he extended his liking to Lily Bart If
these two factors seem incompatible to the student of feminine
psychology it must be remembered that Gerty had always been a parasite
in the moral order living on the crumbs of other tables and content to
look through the window at the banquet spread for her friends Now that
she was enjoying a little private feast of her own it would have seemed
incredibly selfish not to lay a plate for a friend and there was no one
with whom she would rather have shared her enjoyment than Miss Bart

As to the nature of Seldens growing kindness Gerty would no more have
dared to define it than she would have tried to learn a butterflys
colours by knocking the dust from its wings To seize on the wonder would
be to brush off its bloom and perhaps see it fade and stiffen in her
hand better the sense of beauty palpitating out of reach while she held
her breath and watched where it would alight Yet Seldens manner at the
Brys had brought the flutter of wings so close that they seemed to be
beating in her own heart She had never seen him so alert so responsive
so attentive to what she had to say His habitual manner had an
absentminded kindliness which she accepted and was grateful for as the
liveliest sentiment her presence was likely to inspire but she was quick
to feel in him a change implying that for once she could give pleasure as
well as receive it

And it was so delightful that this higher degree of sympathy should be
reached through their interest in Lily Bart

Gertys affection for her frienda sentiment that had learned to keep
itself alive on the scantiest diethad grown to active adoration since
Lilys restless curiosity had drawn her into the circle of Miss Farishs
work Lilys taste of beneficence had wakened in her a momentary appetite
for welldoing Her visit to the Girls Club had first brought her in
contact with the dramatic contrasts of life She had always accepted with
philosophic calm the fact that such existences as hers were pedestalled
on foundations of obscure humanity The dreary limbo of dinginess lay all
around and beneath that little illuminated circle in which life reached
its finest efflorescence as the mud and sleet of a winter night enclose
a hothouse filled with tropical flowers All this was in the natural
order of things and the orchid basking in its artificially created
atmosphere could round the delicate curves of its petals undisturbed by
the ice on the panes

But it is one thing to live comfortably with the abstract conception of
poverty another to be brought in contact with its human embodiments
Lily had never conceived of these victims of fate otherwise than in the
mass That the mass was composed of individual lives innumerable
separate centres of sensation with her own eager reachings for pleasure
her own fierce revulsions from painthat some of these bundles of
feeling were clothed in shapes not so unlike her own with eyes meant to
look on gladness and young lips shaped for lovethis discovery gave
Lily one of those sudden shocks of pity that sometimes decentralize a
life Lilys nature was incapable of such renewal she could feel other
demands only through her own and no pain was long vivid which did not
press on an answering nerve But for the moment she was drawn out of
herself by the interest of her direct relation with a world so unlike her
own She had supplemented her first gift by personal assistance to one or
two of Miss Farishs most appealing subjects and the admiration and
interest her presence excited among the tired workers at the club
ministered in a new form to her insatiable desire to please

Gerty Farish was not a close enough reader of character to disentangle
the mixed threads of which Lilys philanthropy was woven She supposed
her beautiful friend to be actuated by the same motive as herselfthat
sharpening of the moral vision which makes all human suffering so near
and insistent that the other aspects of life fade into remoteness Gerty
lived by such simple formulas that she did not hesitate to class her
friends state with the emotional change of heart to which her dealings
with the poor had accustomed her and she rejoiced in the thought that
she had been the humble instrument of this renewal Now she had an answer
to all criticisms of Lilys conduct as she had said she knew the real
Lily and the discovery that Selden shared her knowledge raised her
placid acceptance of life to a dazzled sense of its possibilitiesa
sense farther enlarged in the course of the afternoon by the receipt of
a telegram from Selden asking if he might dine with her that evening

While Gerty was lost in the happy bustle which this announcement produced
in her small household Selden was at one with her in thinking with
intensity of Lily Bart The case which had called him to Albany was not
complicated enough to absorb all his attention and he had the
professional faculty of keeping a part of his mind free when its services
were not needed This partwhich at the moment seemed dangerously like
the wholewas filled to the brim with the sensations of the previous
evening Selden understood the symptoms he recognized the fact that he
was paying up as there had always been a chance of his having to pay up
for the voluntary exclusions of his past He had meant to keep free from
permanent ties not from any poverty of feeling but because in a
different way he was as much as Lily the victim of his environment
There had been a germ of truth in his declaration to Gerty Farish that he
had never wanted to marry a nice girl the adjective connoting in his
cousins vocabulary certain utilitarian qualities which are apt to
preclude the luxury of charm Now it had been Seldens fate to have a
charming mother her graceful portrait all smiles and Cashmere still
emitted a faded scent of the undefinable quality His father was the kind
of man who delights in a charming woman who quotes her stimulates her
and keeps her perennially charming Neither one of the couple cared for
money but their disdain of it took the form of always spending a little
more than was prudent If their house was shabby it was exquisitely
kept if there were good books on the shelves there were also good dishes
on the table Selden senior had an eye for a picture his wife an
understanding of old lace and both were so conscious of restraint and
discrimination in buying that they never quite knew how it was that the
bills mounted up

Though many of Seldens friends would have called his parents poor he
had grown up in an atmosphere where restricted means were felt only as a
check on aimless profusion where the few possessions were so good that
their rarity gave them a merited relief and abstinence was combined with
elegance in a way exemplified by Mrs Seldens knack of wearing her old
velvet as if it were new A man has the advantage of being delivered
early from the home point of view and before Selden left college he had
learned that there are as many different ways of going without money as
of spending it Unfortunately he found no way as agreeable as that
practised at home and his views of womankind in especial were tinged by
the remembrance of the one woman who had given him his sense of values
It was from her that he inherited his detachment from the sumptuary side
of life the stoics carelessness of material things combined with the
Epicureans pleasure in them Life shorn of either feeling appeared to
him a diminished thing and nowhere was the blending of the two
ingredients so essential as in the character of a pretty woman

It had always seemed to Selden that experience offered a great deal
besides the sentimental adventure yet he could vividly conceive of a
love which should broaden and deepen till it became the central fact of
life What he could not accept in his own case was the makeshift
alternative of a relation that should be less than this that should
leave some portions of his nature unsatisfied while it put an undue
strain on others He would not in other words yield to the growth of an
affection which might appeal to pity yet leave the understanding
untouched sympathy should no more delude him than a trick of the eyes
the grace of helplessness than a curve of the cheek

But nowthat little BUT passed like a sponge over all his vows His
reasonedout resistances seemed for the moment so much less important
than the question as to when Lily would receive his note He yielded
himself to the charm of trivial preoccupations wondering at what hour
her reply would be sent with what words it would begin As to its import
he had no doubthe was as sure of her surrender as of his own And so
he had leisure to muse on all its exquisite details as a hard worker on
a holiday morning might lie still and watch the beam of light travel
gradually across his room But if the new light dazzled it did not blind
him He could still discern the outline of facts though his own relation
to them had changed He was no less conscious than before of what was
said of Lily Bart but he could separate the woman he knew from the
vulgar estimate of her His mind turned to Gerty Farishs words and the
wisdom of the world seemed a groping thing beside the insight of
innocence BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART FOR THEY SHALL SEE GODeven
the hidden god in their neighbours breast Selden was in the state of
impassioned selfabsorption that the first surrender to love produces
His craving was for the companionship of one whose point of view should
justify his own who should confirm by deliberate observation the truth
to which his intuitions had leaped He could not wait for the midday
recess but seized a moments leisure in court to scribble his telegram
to Gerty Farish

Reaching town he was driven direct to his club where he hoped a note
from Miss Bart might await him But his box contained only a line of
rapturous assent from Gerty and he was turning away disappointed when he
was hailed by a voice from the smoking room

Hallo Lawrence Dining here Take a bite with meIve ordered a
canvasback

He discovered Trenor in his day clothes sitting with a tall glass at
his elbow behind the folds of a sporting journal

Selden thanked him but pleaded an engagement

Hang it I believe every man in town has an engagement tonight I shall
have the club to myself You know how Im living this winter rattling
round in that empty house My wife meant to come to town today but shes
put it off again and how is a fellow to dine alone in a room with the
lookingglasses covered and nothing but a bottle of Harvey sauce on the
sideboard I say Lawrence chuck your engagement and take pity on
meit gives me the blue devils to dine alone and theres nobody but
that canting ass Wetherall in the club

Sorry GusI cant do it

As Selden turned away he noticed the dark flush on Trenors face the
unpleasant moisture of his intensely white forehead the way his jewelled
rings were wedged in the creases of his fat red fingers Certainly the
beast was predominatingthe beast at the bottom of the glass And he had
heard this mans name coupled with Lilys Bahthe thought sickened him
all the way back to his rooms he was haunted by the sight of Trenors fat
creased hands

On his table lay the note Lily had sent it to his rooms He knew what
was in it before he broke the seala grey seal with BEYOND beneath a
flying ship Ah he would take her beyondbeyond the ugliness the
pettiness the attrition and corrosion of the soul



Gertys little sittingroom sparkled with welcome when Selden entered it
Its modest effects compact of enamel paint and ingenuity spoke to him
in the language just then sweetest to his ear It is surprising how
little narrow walls and a low ceiling matter when the roof of the soul
has suddenly been raised Gerty sparkled too or at least shone with a
tempered radiance He had never before noticed that she had
pointsreally some good fellow might do worse    Over the little
dinner and here again the effects were wonderful he told her she
ought to marryhe was in a mood to pair off the whole world She had
made the caramel custard with her own hands It was sinful to keep such
gifts to herself He reflected with a throb of pride that Lily could trim
her own hatsshe had told him so the day of their walk at Bellomont

He did not speak of Lily till after dinner During the little repast he
kept the talk on his hostess who fluttered at being the centre of
observation shone as rosy as the candleshades she had manufactured for
the occasion Selden evinced an extraordinary interest in her household
arrangements complimented her on the ingenuity with which she had
utilized every inch of her small quarters asked how her servant managed
about afternoons out learned that one may improvise delicious dinners in
a chafingdish and uttered thoughtful generalizations on the burden of a
large establishment

When they were in the sittingroom again where they fitted as snugly as
bits in a puzzle and she had brewed the coffee and poured it into her
grandmothers eggshell cups his eye as he leaned back basking in the
warm fragrance lighted on a recent photograph of Miss Bart and the
desired transition was effected without an effort The photograph was
well enoughbut to catch her as she had looked last night Gerty agreed
with himnever had she been so radiant But could photography capture
that light There had been a new look in her facesomething different
yes Selden agreed there had been something different The coffee was so
exquisite that he asked for a second cup such a contrast to the watery
stuff at the club Ah your poor bachelor with his impersonal club fare
alternating with the equally impersonal CUISINE of the dinnerparty A
man who lived in lodgings missed the best part of lifehe pictured the
flavourless solitude of Trenors repast and felt a moments compassion
for the man    But to return to Lilyand again and again he returned
questioning conjecturing leading Gerty on draining her inmost thoughts
of their stored tenderness for her friend

At first she poured herself out unstintingly happy in this perfect
communion of their sympathies His understanding of Lily helped to
confirm her own belief in her friend They dwelt together on the fact
that Lily had had no chance Gerty instanced her generous impulsesher
restlessness and discontent The fact that her life had never satisfied
her proved that she was made for better things She might have married
more than oncethe conventional rich marriage which she had been taught
to consider the sole end of existencebut when the opportunity came she
had always shrunk from it Percy Gryce for instance had been in love
with herevery one at Bellomont had supposed them to be engaged and her
dismissal of him was thought inexplicable This view of the Gryce
incident chimed too well with Seldens mood not to be instantly adopted
by him with a flash of retrospective contempt for what had once seemed
the obvious solution If rejection there had beenand he wondered now
that he had ever doubted itthen he held the key to the secret and the
hillsides of Bellomont were lit up not with sunset but with dawn It
was he who had wavered and disowned the face of opportunityand the joy
now warming his breast might have been a familiar inmate if he had
captured it in its first flight

It was at this point perhaps that a joy just trying its wings in
Gertys heart dropped to earth and lay still She sat facing Selden
repeating mechanically No she has never been understood and all
the while she herself seemed to be sitting in the centre of a great glare
of comprehension The little confidential room where a moment ago their
thoughts had touched elbows like their chairs grew to unfriendly
vastness separating her from Selden by all the length of her new vision
of the futureand that future stretched out interminably with her
lonely figure toiling down it a mere speck on the solitude

She is herself with a few people only and you are one of them she
heard Selden saying And again Be good to her Gerty wont you and
She has it in her to become whatever she is believed to beyoull help
her by believing the best of her

The words beat on Gertys brain like the sound of a language which has
seemed familiar at a distance but on approaching is found to be
unintelligible He had come to talk to her of Lilythat was all There
had been a third at the feast she had spread for him and that third had
taken her own place She tried to follow what he was saying to cling to
her own part in the talkbut it was all as meaningless as the boom of
waves in a drowning head and she felt as the drowning may feel that to
sink would be nothing beside the pain of struggling to keep up

Selden rose and she drew a deep breath feeling that soon she could
yield to the blessed waves

Mrs Fishers You say she was dining there Theres music afterward I
believe I had a card from her He glanced at the foolish pinkfaced
clock that was drumming out this hideous hour A quarter past ten I
might look in there now the Fisher evenings are amusing I havent kept
you up too late Gerty You look tiredIve rambled on and bored you
And in the unwonted overflow of his feelings he left a cousinly kiss
upon her cheek



At Mrs Fishers through the cigarsmoke of the studio a dozen voices
greeted Selden A song was pending as he entered and he dropped into a
seat near his hostess his eyes roaming in search of Miss Bart But she
was not there and the discovery gave him a pang out of all proportion to
its seriousness since the note in his breastpocket assured him that at
four the next day they would meet To his impatience it seemed
immeasurably long to wait and halfashamed of the impulse he leaned to
Mrs Fisher to ask as the music ceased if Miss Bart had not dined with
her

Lily Shes just gone She had to run off I forget where Wasnt she
wonderful last night

Whos that Lily asked Jack Stepney from the depths of a neighbouring
armchair Really you know Im no prude but when it comes to a girl
standing there as if she was up at auctionI thought seriously of
speaking to cousin Julia

You didnt know Jack had become our social censor Mrs Fisher said to
Selden with a laugh and Stepney spluttered amid the general derision
But shes a cousin hang it and when a mans marriedTOWN TALK was
full of her this morning

Yes lively reading that was said Mr Ned Van Alstyne stroking his
moustache to hide the smile behind it Buy the dirty sheet No of
course not some fellow showed it to mebut Id heard the stories
before When a girls as goodlooking as that shed better marry then no
questions are asked In our imperfectly organized society there is no
provision as yet for the young woman who claims the privileges of
marriage without assuming its obligations

Well I understand Lily is about to assume them in the shape of Mr
Rosedale Mrs Fisher said with a laugh

Rosedalegood heavens exclaimed Van Alstyne dropping his eyeglass
Stepney thats your fault for foisting the brute on us

Oh confound it you know we dont MARRY Rosedale in our family
Stepney languidly protested but his wife who sat in oppressive bridal
finery at the other side of the room quelled him with the judicial
reflection In Lilys circumstances its a mistake to have too high a
standard

I hear even Rosedale has been scared by the talk lately Mrs Fisher
rejoined but the sight of her last night sent him off his head What do
you think he said to me after her TABLEAU My God Mrs Fisher if I
could get Paul Morpeth to paint her like that the pictured appreciate a
hundred per cent in ten years

By Jovebut isnt she about somewhere exclaimed Van Alstyne
restoring his glass with an uneasy glance

No she ran off while you were all mixing the punch down stairs Where
was she going by the way Whats on tonight I hadnt heard of anything

Oh not a party I think said an inexperienced young Farish who had
arrived late I put her in her cab as I was coming in and she gave the
driver the Trenors address

The Trenors exclaimed Mrs Jack Stepney Why the house is
closedJudy telephoned me from Bellomont this evening

Did she Thats queer Im sure Im not mistaken Well come now
Trenors there anyhowIoh wellthe fact is Ive no head for
numbers he broke off admonished by the nudge of an adjoining foot and
the smile that circled the room

In its unpleasant light Selden had risen and was shaking hands with his
hostess The air of the place stifled him and he wondered why he had
stayed in it so long

On the doorstep he stood still remembering a phrase of Lilys It seems
to me you spend a good deal of time in the element you disapprove of

Wellwhat had brought him there but the quest of her It was her
element not his But he would lift her out of it take her beyond That
BEYOND on her letter was like a cry for rescue He knew that Perseuss
task is not done when he has loosed Andromedas chains for her limbs are
numb with bondage and she cannot rise and walk but clings to him with
dragging arms as he beats back to land with his burden Well he had
strength for bothit was her weakness which had put the strength in him
It was not alas a clean rush of waves they had to win through but a
clogging morass of old associations and habits and for the moment its
vapours were in his throat But he would see clearer breathe freer in
her presence she was at once the dead weight at his breast and the spar
which should float them to safety He smiled at the whirl of metaphor
with which he was trying to build up a defence against the influences of
the last hour It was pitiable that he who knew the mixed motives on
which social judgments depend should still feel himself so swayed by
them How could he lift Lily to a freer vision of life if his own view
of her was to be coloured by any mind in which he saw her reflected

The moral oppression had produced a physical craving for air and he
strode on opening his lungs to the reverberating coldness of the night
At the corner of Fifth Avenue Van Alstyne hailed him with an offer of
company

Walking A good thing to blow the smoke out of ones head Now that
women have taken to tobacco we live in a bath of nicotine It would be a
curious thing to study the effect of cigarettes on the relation of the
sexes Smoke is almost as great a solvent as divorce both tend to
obscure the moral issue

Nothing could have been less consonant with Seldens mood than Van
Alstynes afterdinner aphorisms but as long as the latter confined
himself to generalities his listeners nerves were in control Happily
Van Alstyne prided himself on his summing up of social aspects and with
Selden for audience was eager to show the sureness of his touch Mrs
Fisher lived in an East side street near the Park and as the two men
walked down Fifth Avenue the new architectural developments of that
versatile thoroughfare invited Van Alstynes comment

That Greiner house nowa typical rung in the social ladder The man
who built it came from a MILIEU where all the dishes are put on the table
at once His facade is a complete architectural meal if he had omitted a
style his friends might have thought the money had given out Not a bad
purchase for Rosedale though attracts attention and awes the Western
sightseer By and bye hell get out of that phase and want something
that the crowd will pass and the few pause before Especially if he
marries my clever cousin

Selden dashed in with the query And the Wellington Brys Rather
clever of its kind dont you think

They were just beneath the wide white facade with its rich restraint of
line which suggested the clever corseting of a redundant figure

Thats the next stage the desire to imply that one has been to Europe
and has a standard Im sure Mrs Bry thinks her house a copy of the
TRIANON in America every marble house with gilt furniture is thought to
be a copy of the TRIANON What a clever chap that architect is
thoughhow he takes his clients measure He has put the whole of Mrs
Bry in his use of the composite order Now for the Trenors you remember
he chose the Corinthian exuberant but based on the best precedent The
Trenor house is one of his best thingsdoesnt look like a
banquetinghall turned inside out I hear Mrs Trenor wants to build out
a new ballroom and that divergence from Gus on that point keeps her at
Bellomont The dimensions of the Brys ballroom must rankle you may be
sure she knows em as well as if shed been there last night with a
yardmeasure Who said she was in town by the way That Farish boy She
isnt I know Mrs Stepney was right the house is dark you see I
suppose Gus lives in the back

He had halted opposite the Trenors corner and Selden perforce stayed
his steps also The house loomed obscure and uninhabited only an oblong
gleam above the door spoke of provisional occupancy

Theyve bought the house at the back it gives them a hundred and fifty
feet in the side street Theres where the ballrooms to be with a
gallery connecting it billiardroom and so on above I suggested
changing the entrance and carrying the drawingroom across the whole
Fifth Avenue front you see the front door corresponds with the
windows

The walkingstick which Van Alstyne swung in demonstration dropped to a
startled Hallo as the door opened and two figures were seen
silhouetted against the halllight At the same moment a hansom halted at
the curbstone and one of the figures floated down to it in a haze of
evening draperies while the other black and bulky remained
persistently projected against the light

For an immeasurable second the two spectators of the incident were
silent then the housedoor closed the hansom rolled off and the whole
scene slipped by as if with the turn of a stereopticon

Van Alstyne dropped his eyeglass with a low whistle

Ahemnothing of this eh Selden As one of the family I know I may
count on youappearances are deceptiveand Fifth Avenue is so
imperfectly lighted

Goodnight said Selden turning sharply down the side street without
seeing the others extended hand



Alone with her cousins kiss Gerty stared upon her thoughts He had
kissed her beforebut not with another woman on his lips If he had
spared her that she could have drowned quietly welcoming the dark flood
as it submerged her But now the flood was shot through with glory and
it was harder to drown at sunrise than in darkness Gerty hid her face
from the light but it pierced to the crannies of her soul She had been
so contented life had seemed so simple and sufficientwhy had he come
to trouble her with new hopes And LilyLily her best friend
Womanlike she accused the woman Perhaps had it not been for Lily
her fond imagining might have become truth Selden had always liked
herhad understood and sympathized with the modest independence of her
life He who had the reputation of weighing all things in the nice
balance of fastidious perceptions had been uncritical and simple in his
view of her his cleverness had never overawed her because she had felt
at home in his heart And now she was thrust out and the door barred
against her by Lilys hand Lily for whose admission there she herself
had pleaded The situation was lighted up by a dreary flash of irony She
knew Seldenshe saw how the force of her faith in Lily must have helped
to dispel his hesitations She remembered too how Lily had talked of
himshe saw herself bringing the two together making them known to each
other On Seldens part no doubt the wound inflicted was inconscient
he had never guessed her foolish secret but LilyLily must have known
When in such matters are a womans perceptions at fault And if she
knew then she had deliberately despoiled her friend and in mere
wantonness of power since even to Gertys suddenly flaming jealousy it
seemed incredible that Lily should wish to be Seldens wife Lily might
be incapable of marrying for money but she was equally incapable of
living without it and Seldens eager investigations into the small
economies of housekeeping made him appear to Gerty as tragically duped
as herself

She remained long in her sittingroom where the embers were crumbling to
cold grey and the lamp paled under its gay shade Just beneath it stood
the photograph of Lily Bart looking out imperially on the cheap
gimcracks the cramped furniture of the little room Could Selden picture
her in such an interior Gerty felt the poverty the insignificance of
her surroundings she beheld her life as it must appear to Lily And the
cruelty of Lilys judgments smote upon her memory She saw that she had
dressed her idol with attributes of her own making When had Lily ever
really felt or pitied or understood All she wanted was the taste of
new experiences she seemed like some cruel creature experimenting in a
laboratory

The pinkfaced clock drummed out another hour and Gerty rose with a
start She had an appointment early the next morning with a district
visitor on the East side She put out her lamp covered the fire and
went into her bedroom to undress In the little glass above her
dressingtable she saw her face reflected against the shadows of the
room and tears blotted the reflection What right had she to dream the
dreams of loveliness A dull face invited a dull fate She cried quietly
as she undressed laying aside her clothes with her habitual precision
setting everything in order for the next day when the old life must be
taken up as though there had been no break in its routine Her servant
did not come till eight oclock and she prepared her own teatray and
placed it beside the bed Then she locked the door of the flat
extinguished her light and lay down But on her bed sleep would not
come and she lay face to face with the fact that she hated Lily Bart It
closed with her in the darkness like some formless evil to be blindly
grappled with Reason judgment renunciation all the sane daylight
forces were beaten back in the sharp struggle for selfpreservation She
wanted happinesswanted it as fiercely and unscrupulously as Lily did
but without Lilys power of obtaining it And in her conscious impotence
she lay shivering and hated her friend

A ring at the doorbell caught her to her feet She struck a light and
stood startled listening For a moment her heart beat incoherently then
she felt the sobering touch of fact and remembered that such calls were
not unknown in her charitable work She flung on her dressinggown to
answer the summons and unlocking her door confronted the shining vision
of Lily Bart

Gertys first movement was one of revulsion She shrank back as though
Lilys presence flashed too sudden a light upon her misery Then she
heard her name in a cry had a glimpse of her friends face and felt
herself caught and clung to

Lilywhat is it she exclaimed

Miss Bart released her and stood breathing brokenly like one who has
gained shelter after a long flight

I was so coldI couldnt go home Have you a fire

Gertys compassionate instincts responding to the swift call of habit
swept aside all her reluctances Lily was simply some one who needed
helpfor what reason there was no time to pause and conjecture
disciplined sympathy checked the wonder on Gertys lips and made her
draw her friend silently into the sittingroom and seat her by the
darkened hearth

There is kindling wood here the fire will burn in a minute

She knelt down and the flame leapt under her rapid hands It flashed
strangely through the tears which still blurred her eyes and smote on
the white ruin of Lilys face The girls looked at each other in silence
then Lily repeated I couldnt go home

Nonoyou came here dear Youre cold and tiredsit quiet and Ill
make you some tea

Gerty had unconsciously adopted the soothing note of her trade all
personal feeling was merged in the sense of ministry and experience had
taught her that the bleeding must be stayed before the wound is probed

Lily sat quiet leaning to the fire the clatter of cups behind her
soothed her as familiar noises hush a child whom silence has kept
wakeful But when Gerty stood at her side with the tea she pushed it
away and turned an estranged eye on the familiar room

I came here because I couldnt bear to be alone she said

Gerty set down the cup and knelt beside her

Lily Something has happenedcant you tell me

I couldnt bear to lie awake in my room till morning I hate my room at
Aunt Juliasso I came here

She stirred suddenly broke from her apathy and clung to Gerty in a
fresh burst of fear

Oh Gerty the furies    you know the noise of their wingsalone at
night in the dark But you dont knowthere is nothing to make the dark
dreadful to you

The words flashing back on Gertys last hours struck from her a faint
derisive murmur but Lily in the blaze of her own misery was blinded to
everything outside it

Youll let me stay I shant mind when daylight comesIs it late Is
the night nearly over It must be awful to be sleeplesseverything
stands by the bed and stares

Miss Farish caught her straying hands Lily look at me Something has
happenedan accident You have been frightenedwhat has frightened you
Tell me if you cana word or twoso that I can help you

Lily shook her head

I am not frightened thats not the word Can you imagine looking into
your glass some morning and seeing a disfigurementsome hideous change
that has come to you while you slept Well I seem to myself like thatI
cant bear to see myself in my own thoughtsI hate ugliness you
knowIve always turned from itbut I cant explain to youyou
wouldnt understand

She lifted her head and her eyes fell on the clock

How long the night is And I know I shant sleep tomorrow Some one told
me my father used to lie sleepless and think of horrors And he was not
wicked only unfortunateand I see now how he must have suffered lying
alone with his thoughts But I am bada bad girlall my thoughts are
badI have always had bad people about me Is that any excuse I thought
I could manage my own lifeI was proudproud but now Im on their
level

Sobs shook her and she bowed to them like a tree in a dry storm

Gerty knelt beside her waiting with the patience born of experience
till this gust of misery should loosen fresh speech She had first
imagined some physical shock some peril of the crowded streets since
Lily was presumably on her way home from Carry Fishers but she now saw
that other nervecentres were smitten and her mind trembled back from
conjecture

Lilys sobs ceased and she lifted her head

There are bad girls in your slums Tell medo they ever pick themselves
up Ever forget and feel as they did before

Lily you mustnt speak soyoure dreaming

Dont they always go from bad to worse Theres no turning backyour
old self rejects you and shuts you out

She rose stretching her arms as if in utter physical weariness Go to
bed dear You work hard and get up early Ill watch here by the fire
and youll leave the light and your door open All I want is to feel
that you are near me She laid both hands on Gertys shoulders with a
smile that was like sunrise on a sea strewn with wreckage

I cant leave you Lily Come and lie on my bed Your hands are
frozenyou must undress and be made warm Gerty paused with sudden
compunction But Mrs Penistonits past midnight What will she think

She goes to bed I have a latchkey It doesnt matterI cant go back
there

Theres no need to you shall stay here But you must tell me where you
have been Listen Lilyit will help you to speak She regained Miss
Barts hands and pressed them against her Try to tell meit will
clear your poor head Listenyou were dining at Carry Fishers Gerty
paused and added with a flash of heroism Lawrence Selden went from here
to find you

At the word Lilys face melted from locked anguish to the open misery of
a child Her lips trembled and her gaze widened with tears

He went to find me And I missed him Oh Gerty he tried to help me
He told mehe warned me long agohe foresaw that I should grow hateful
to myself

The name as Gerty saw with a clutch at the heart had loosened the
springs of selfpity in her friends dry breast and tear by tear Lily
poured out the measure of her anguish She had dropped sideways in
Gertys big armchair her head buried where lately Seldens had leaned
in a beauty of abandonment that drove home to Gertys aching senses the
inevitableness of her own defeat Ah it needed no deliberate purpose on
Lilys part to rob her of her dream To look on that prone loveliness was
to see in it a natural force to recognize that love and power belong to
such as Lily as renunciation and service are the lot of those they
despoil But if Seldens infatuation seemed a fatal necessity the effect
that his name produced shook Gertys steadfastness with a last pang Men
pass through such superhuman loves and outlive them they are the
probation subduing the heart to human joys How gladly Gerty would have
welcomed the ministry of healing how willingly have soothed the sufferer
back to tolerance of life But Lilys selfbetrayal took this last hope
from her The mortal maid on the shore is helpless against the siren who
loves her prey such victims are floated back dead from their adventure

Lily sprang up and caught her with strong hands Gerty you know
himyou understand himtell me if I went to him if I told him
everythingif I said I am bad through and throughI want admiration
I want excitement I want money yes MONEY Thats my shame
Gertyand its known its said of meits what men think of meIf I
said it all to himtold him the whole storysaid plainly Ive sunk
lower than the lowest for Ive taken what they take and not paid as
they payoh Gerty you know him you can speak for him if I told him
everything would he loathe me Or would he pity me and understand me
and save me from loathing myself

Gerty stood cold and passive She knew the hour of her probation had
come and her poor heart beat wildly against its destiny As a dark river
sweeps by under a lightning flash she saw her chance of happiness surge
past under a flash of temptation What prevented her from saying He is
like other men She was not so sure of him after all But to do so
would have been like blaspheming her love She could not put him before
herself in any light but the noblest she must trust him to the height of
her own passion

Yes I know him he will help you she said and in a moment Lilys
passion was weeping itself out against her breast

There was but one bed in the little flat and the two girls lay down on
it side by side when Gerty had unlaced Lilys dress and persuaded her to
put her lips to the warm tea The light extinguished they lay still in
the darkness Gerty shrinking to the outer edge of the narrow couch to
avoid contact with her bedfellow Knowing that Lily disliked to be
caressed she had long ago learned to check her demonstrative impulses
toward her friend But tonight every fibre in her body shrank from Lilys
nearness it was torture to listen to her breathing and feel the sheet
stir with it As Lily turned and settled to completer rest a strand of
her hair swept Gertys cheek with its fragrance Everything about her was
warm and soft and scented even the stains of her grief became her as
raindrops do the beaten rose But as Gerty lay with arms drawn down her
side in the motionless narrowness of an effigy she felt a stir of sobs
from the breathing warmth beside her and Lily flung out her hand groped
for her friends and held it fast

Hold me Gerty hold me or I shall think of things she moaned and
Gerty silently slipped an arm under her pillowing her head in its hollow
as a mother makes a nest for a tossing child In the warm hollow Lily lay
still and her breathing grew low and regular Her hand still clung to
Gertys as if to ward off evil dreams but the hold of her fingers
relaxed her head sank deeper into its shelter and Gerty felt that she
slept



Chapter 15

When Lily woke she had the bed to herself and the winter light was in
the room

She sat up bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings then
memory returned and she looked about her with a shiver In the cold
slant of light reflected from the back wall of a neighbouring building
she saw her evening dress and opera cloak lying in a tawdry heap on a
chair Finery laid off is as unappetizing as the remains of a feast and
it occurred to Lily that at home her maids vigilance had always spared
her the sight of such incongruities Her body ached with fatigue and
with the constriction of her attitude in Gertys bed All through her
troubled sleep she had been conscious of having no space to toss in and
the long effort to remain motionless made her feel as if she had spent
her night in a train

This sense of physical discomfort was the first to assert itself then
she perceived beneath it a corresponding mental prostration a languor
of horror more insufferable than the first rush of her disgust The
thought of having to wake every morning with this weight on her breast
roused her tired mind to fresh effort She must find some way out of the
slough into which she had stumbled it was not so much compunction as the
dread of her morning thoughts that pressed on her the need of action But
she was unutterably tired it was weariness to think connectedly She lay
back looking about the poor slit of a room with a renewal of physical
distaste The outer air penned between high buildings brought no
freshness through the window steamheat was beginning to sing in a coil
of dingy pipes and a smell of cooking penetrated the crack of the door

The door opened and Gerty dressed and hatted entered with a cup of
tea Her face looked sallow and swollen in the dreary light and her dull
hair shaded imperceptibly into the tones of her skin

She glanced shyly at Lily asking in an embarrassed tone how she felt
Lily answered with the same constraint and raised herself up to drink
the tea

I must have been overtired last night I think I had a nervous attack
in the carriage she said as the drink brought clearness to her
sluggish thoughts

You were not well I am so glad you came here Gerty returned

But how am I to get home And Aunt Julia

She knows I telephoned early and your maid has brought your things
But wont you eat something I scrambled the eggs myself

Lily could not eat but the tea strengthened her to rise and dress under
her maids searching gaze It was a relief to her that Gerty was obliged
to hasten away the two kissed silently but without a trace of the
previous nights emotion

Lily found Mrs Peniston in a state of agitation She had sent for Grace
Stepney and was taking digitalis Lily breasted the storm of enquiries as
best she could explaining that she had had an attack of faintness on her
way back from Carry Fishers that fearing she would not have strength
to reach home she had gone to Miss Farishs instead but that a quiet
night had restored her and that she had no need of a doctor

This was a relief to Mrs Peniston who could give herself up to her own
symptoms and Lily was advised to go and lie down her aunts panacea for
all physical and moral disorders In the solitude of her own room she was
brought back to a sharp contemplation of facts Her daylight view of them
necessarily differed from the cloudy vision of the night The winged
furies were now prowling gossips who dropped in on each other for tea
But her fears seemed the uglier thus shorn of their vagueness and
besides she had to act not rave For the first time she forced herself
to reckon up the exact amount of her debt to Trenor and the result of
this hateful computation was the discovery that she had in all received
nine thousand dollars from him The flimsy pretext on which it had been
given and received shrivelled up in the blaze of her shame she knew that
not a penny of it was her own and that to restore her selfrespect she
must at once repay the whole amount The inability thus to solace her
outraged feelings gave her a paralyzing sense of insignificance She was
realizing for the first time that a womans dignity may cost more to keep
up than her carriage and that the maintenance of a moral attribute
should be dependent on dollars and cents made the world appear a more
sordid place than she had conceived it

After luncheon when Grace Stepneys prying eyes had been removed Lily
asked for a word with her aunt The two ladies went upstairs to the
sittingroom where Mrs Peniston seated herself in her black satin
armchair tufted with yellow buttons beside a beadwork table bearing a
bronze box with a miniature of Beatrice Cenci in the lid Lily felt for
these objects the same distaste which the prisoner may entertain for the
fittings of the courtroom It was here that her aunt received her rare
confidences and the pinkeyed smirk of the turbaned Beatrice was
associated in her mind with the gradual fading of the smile from Mrs
Penistons lips That ladys dread of a scene gave her an inexorableness
which the greatest strength of character could not have produced since
it was independent of all considerations of right or wrong and knowing
this Lily seldom ventured to assail it She had never felt less like
making the attempt than on the present occasion but she had sought in
vain for any other means of escape from an intolerable situation

Mrs Peniston examined her critically Youre a bad colour Lily this
incessant rushing about is beginning to tell on you she said

Miss Bart saw an opening I dont think its that Aunt Julia Ive had
worries she replied

Ah said Mrs Peniston shutting her lips with the snap of a purse
closing against a beggar

Im sorry to bother you with them Lily continued but I really
believe my faintness last night was brought on partly by anxious
thoughts

I should have said Carry Fishers cook was enough to account for it
She has a woman who was with Maria Melson in 1891the spring of the year
we went to Aixand I remember dining there two days before we sailed
and feeling SURE the coppers hadnt been scoured

I dont think I ate much I cant eat or sleep Lily paused and then
said abruptly The fact is Aunt Julia I owe some money

Mrs Penistons face clouded perceptibly but did not express the
astonishment her niece had expected She was silent and Lily was forced
to continue I have been foolish

No doubt you have extremely foolish Mrs Peniston interposed I
fail to see how any one with your income and no expensesnot to mention
the handsome presents Ive always given you

Oh youve been most generous Aunt Julia I shall never forget your
kindness But perhaps you dont quite realize the expense a girl is put
to nowadays

I dont realize that YOU are put to any expense except for your clothes
and your railway fares I expect you to be handsomely dressed but I paid
Celestes bill for you last October

Lily hesitated her aunts implacable memory had never been more
inconvenient You were as kind as possible but I have had to get a few
things since

What kind of things Clothes How much have you spent Let me see the
billI daresay the woman is swindling you

Oh no I think not clothes have grown so frightfully expensive and
one needs so many different kinds with country visits and golf and
skating and Aiken and Tuxedo

Let me see the bill Mrs Peniston repeated

Lily hesitated again In the first place Mme Celeste had not yet sent
in her account and secondly the amount it represented was only a
fraction of the sum that Lily needed

She hasnt sent in the bill for my winter things but I KNOW its large
and there are one or two other things Ive been careless and
imprudentIm frightened to think of what I owe

She raised the troubled loveliness of her face to Mrs Peniston vainly
hoping that a sight so moving to the other sex might not be without
effect upon her own But the effect produced was that of making Mrs
Peniston shrink back apprehensively

Really Lily you are old enough to manage your own affairs and after
frightening me to death by your performance of last night you might at
least choose a better time to worry me with such matters Mrs Peniston
glanced at the clock and swallowed a tablet of digitalis If you owe
Celeste another thousand she may send me her account she added as
though to end the discussion at any cost

I am very sorry Aunt Julia I hate to trouble you at such a time but I
have really no choiceI ought to have spoken soonerI owe a great deal
more than a thousand dollars

A great deal more Do you owe two She must have robbed you

I told you it was not only Celeste Ithere are other billsmore
pressingthat must be settled

What on earth have you been buying Jewelry You must have gone off your
head said Mrs Peniston with asperity But if you have run into debt
you must suffer the consequences and put aside your monthly income till
your bills are paid If you stay quietly here until next spring instead
of racing about all over the country you will have no expenses at all
and surely in four or five months you can settle the rest of your bills
if I pay the dressmaker now

Lily was again silent She knew she could not hope to extract even a
thousand dollars from Mrs Peniston on the mere plea of paying Celestes
bill Mrs Peniston would expect to go over the dressmakers account
and would make out the cheque to her and not to Lily And yet the money
must be obtained before the day was over

The debts I speak of aredifferentnot like tradesmens bills she
began confusedly but Mrs Penistons look made her almost afraid to
continue Could it be that her aunt suspected anything The idea
precipitated Lilys avowal

The fact is Ive played cards a good dealbridge the women all do it
girls tooits expected Sometimes Ive wonwon a good dealbut lately
Ive been unluckyand of course such debts cant be paid off
gradually

She paused Mrs Penistons face seemed to be petrifying as she listened

Cardsyouve played cards for money Its true then when I was told
so I wouldnt believe it I wont ask if the other horrors I was told
were true too Ive heard enough for the state of my nerves When I think
of the example youve had in this house But I suppose its your foreign
bringingupno one knew where your mother picked up her friends And her
Sundays were a scandalthat I know

Mrs Peniston wheeled round suddenly You play cards on Sunday

Lily flushed with the recollection of certain rainy Sundays at Bellomont
and with the Dorsets

Youre hard on me Aunt Julia I have never really cared for cards but
a girl hates to be thought priggish and superior and one drifts into
doing what the others do Ive had a dreadful lesson and if youll help
me out this time I promise you

Mrs Peniston raised her hand warningly You neednt make any promises
its unnecessary When I offered you a home I didnt undertake to pay
your gambling debts

Aunt Julia You dont mean that you wont help me

I shall certainly not do anything to give the impression that I
countenance your behaviour If you really owe your dressmaker I will
settle with herbeyond that I recognize no obligation to assume your
debts

Lily had risen and stood pale and quivering before her aunt Pride
stormed in her but humiliation forced the cry from her lips Aunt
Julia I shall be disgracedI But she could go no farther If her
aunt turned such a stony ear to the fiction of the gambling debts in
what spirit would she receive the terrible avowal of the truth

I consider that you ARE disgraced Lily disgraced by your conduct far
more than by its results You say your friends have persuaded you to play
cards with them well they may as well learn a lesson too They can
probably afford to lose a little moneyand at any rate I am not going
to waste any of mine in paying them And now I must ask you to leave
methis scene has been extremely painful and I have my own health to
consider Draw down the blinds please and tell Jennings I will see no
one this afternoon but Grace Stepney

Lily went up to her own room and bolted the door She was trembling with
fear and angerthe rush of the furies wings was in her ears She walked
up and down the room with blind irregular steps The last door of escape
was closedshe felt herself shut in with her dishonour

Suddenly her wild pacing brought her before the clock on the
chimneypiece Its hands stood at halfpast three and she remembered
that Selden was to come to her at four She had meant to put him off with
a wordbut now her heart leaped at the thought of seeing him Was there
not a promise of rescue in his love As she had lain at Gertys side the
night before she had thought of his coming and of the sweetness of
weeping out her pain upon his breast Of course she had meant to clear
herself of its consequences before she met himshe had never really
doubted that Mrs Peniston would come to her aid And she had felt even
in the full storm of her misery that Seldens love could not be her
ultimate refuge only it would be so sweet to take a moments shelter
there while she gathered fresh strength to go on

But now his love was her only hope and as she sat alone with her
wretchedness the thought of confiding in him became as seductive as the
rivers flow to the suicide The first plunge would be terriblebut
afterward what blessedness might come She remembered Gertys words I
know himhe will help you and her mind clung to them as a sick person
might cling to a healing relic Oh if he really understoodif he would
help her to gather up her broken life and put it together in some new
semblance in which no trace of the past should remain He had always made
her feel that she was worthy of better things and she had never been in
greater need of such solace Once and again she shrank at the thought of
imperilling his love by her confession for love was what she neededit
would take the glow of passion to weld together the shattered fragments
of her selfesteem But she recurred to Gertys words and held fast to
them She was sure that Gerty knew Seldens feeling for her and it had
never dawned upon her blindness that Gertys own judgment of him was
coloured by emotions far more ardent than her own

Four oclock found her in the drawingroom she was sure that Selden
would be punctual But the hour came and passedit moved on feverishly
measured by her impatient heartbeats She had time to take a fresh
survey of her wretchedness and to fluctuate anew between the impulse to
confide in Selden and the dread of destroying his illusions But as the
minutes passed the need of throwing herself on his comprehension became
more urgent she could not bear the weight of her misery alone There
would be a perilous moment perhaps but could she not trust to her
beauty to bridge it over to land her safe in the shelter of his devotion

But the hour sped on and Selden did not come Doubtless he had been
detained or had misread her hurriedly scrawled note taking the four for
a five The ringing of the doorbell a few minutes after five confirmed
this supposition and made Lily hastily resolve to write more legibly in
future The sound of steps in the hall and of the butlers voice
preceding them poured fresh energy into her veins She felt herself once
more the alert and competent moulder of emergencies and the remembrance
of her power over Selden flushed her with sudden confidence But when the
drawingroom door opened it was Rosedale who came in

The reaction caused her a sharp pang but after a passing movement of
irritation at the clumsiness of fate and at her own carelessness in not
denying the door to all but Selden she controlled herself and greeted
Rosedale amicably It was annoying that Selden when he came should find
that particular visitor in possession but Lily was mistress of the art
of ridding herself of superfluous company and to her present mood
Rosedale seemed distinctly negligible

His own view of the situation forced itself upon her after a few moments
conversation She had caught at the Brys entertainment as an easy
impersonal subject likely to tide them over the interval till Selden
appeared but Mr Rosedale tenaciously planted beside the teatable his
hands in his pockets his legs a little too freely extended at once gave
the topic a personal turn

Pretty well donewell yes I suppose it was Welly Brys got his back
up and dont mean to let go till hes got the hang of the thing Of
course there were things here and therethings Mrs Fisher couldnt be
expected to see tothe champagne wasnt cold and the coats got mixed in
the coatroom I would have spent more money on the music But thats my
character if I want a thing Im willing to pay I dont go up to the
counter and then wonder if the articles worth the price I wouldnt be
satisfied to entertain like the Welly Brys Id want something that would
look more easy and natural more as if I took it in my stride And it
takes just two things to do that Miss Bart money and the right woman
to spend it

He paused and examined her attentively while she affected to rearrange
the teacups

Ive got the money he continued clearing his throat and what I want
is the womanand I mean to have her too

He leaned forward a little resting his hands on the head of his
walkingstick He had seen men of Ned Van Alstynes type bring their hats
and sticks into a drawingroom and he thought it added a touch of
elegant familiarity to their appearance

Lily was silent smiling faintly with her eyes absently resting on his
face She was in reality reflecting that a declaration would take some
time to make and that Selden must surely appear before the moment of
refusal had been reached Her brooding look as of a mind withdrawn yet
not averted seemed to Mr Rosedale full of a subtle encouragement He
would not have liked any evidence of eagerness

I mean to have her too he repeated with a laugh intended to
strengthen his selfassurance I generally HAVE got what I wanted in
life Miss Bart I wanted money and Ive got more than I know how to
invest and now the money doesnt seem to be of any account unless I can
spend it on the right woman Thats what I want to do with it I want my
wife to make all the other women feel small Id never grudge a dollar
that was spent on that But it isnt every woman can do it no matter how
much you spend on her There was a girl in some history book who wanted
gold shields or something and the fellows threw em at her and she was
crushed under em they killed her Well thats true enough some women
looked buried under their jewelry What I want is a woman wholl hold her
head higher the more diamonds I put on it And when I looked at you the
other night at the Brys in that plain white dress looking as if you
had a crown on I said to myself By gad if she had one shed wear it
as if it grew on her

Still Lily did not speak and he continued warming with his theme Tell
you what it is though that kind of woman costs more than all the rest
of em put together If a womans going to ignore her pearls they want
to be better than anybody elsesand so it is with everything else You
know what I meanyou know its only the showy things that are cheap
Well I should want my wife to be able to take the earth for granted if
she wanted to I know theres one thing vulgar about money and thats
the thinking about it and my wife would never have to demean herself in
that way He paused and then added with an unfortunate lapse to an
earlier manner I guess you know the lady Ive got in view Miss Bart

Lily raised her head brightening a little under the challenge Even
through the dark tumult of her thoughts the clink of Mr Rosedales
millions had a faintly seductive note Oh for enough of them to cancel
her one miserable debt But the man behind them grew increasingly
repugnant in the light of Seldens expected coming The contrast was too
grotesque she could scarcely suppress the smile it provoked She decided
that directness would be best

If you mean me Mr Rosedale I am very gratefulvery much flattered
but I dont know what I have ever done to make you think

Oh if you mean youre not dead in love with me Ive got sense enough
left to see that And I aint talking to you as if you wereI presume I
know the kind of talk thats expected under those circumstances Im
confoundedly gone on youthats about the size of itand Im just
giving you a plain business statement of the consequences Youre not
very fond of meYETbut youre fond of luxury and style and
amusement and of not having to worry about cash You like to have a good
time and not have to settle for it and what I propose to do is to
provide for the good time and do the settling

He paused and she returned with a chilling smile You are mistaken in
one point Mr Rosedale whatever I enjoy I am prepared to settle for

She spoke with the intention of making him see that if his words implied
a tentative allusion to her private affairs she was prepared to meet and
repudiate it But if he recognized her meaning it failed to abash him
and he went on in the same tone I didnt mean to give offence excuse
me if Ive spoken too plainly But why aint you straight with mewhy do
you put up that kind of bluff You know thereve been times when you were
bothereddamned botheredand as a girl gets older and things keep
moving along why before she knows it the things she wants are liable
to move past her and not come back I dont say its anywhere near that
with you yet but youve had a taste of bothers that a girl like yourself
ought never to have known about and what Im offering you is the chance
to turn your back on them once for all

The colour burned in Lilys face as he ended there was no mistaking the
point he meant to make and to permit it to pass unheeded was a fatal
confession of weakness while to resent it too openly was to risk
offending him at a perilous moment Indignation quivered on her lip but
it was quelled by the secret voice which warned her that she must not
quarrel with him He knew too much about her and even at the moment when
it was essential that he should show himself at his best he did not
scruple to let her see how much he knew How then would he use his power
when her expression of contempt had dispelled his one motive for
restraint Her whole future might hinge on her way of answering him she
had to stop and consider that in the stress of her other anxieties as a
breathless fugitive may have to pause at the crossroads and try to
decide coolly which turn to take

You are quite right Mr Rosedale I HAVE had bothers and I am grateful
to you for wanting to relieve me of them It is not always easy to be
quite independent and selfrespecting when one is poor and lives among
rich people I have been careless about money and have worried about my
bills But I should be selfish and ungrateful if I made that a reason for
accepting all you offer with no better return to make than the desire to
be free from my anxieties You must give me timetime to think of your
kindnessand of what I could give you in return for it

She held out her hand with a charming gesture in which dismissal was
shorn of its rigour Its hint of future leniency made Rosedale rise in
obedience to it a little flushed with his unhopedfor success and
disciplined by the tradition of his blood to accept what was conceded
without undue haste to press for more Something in his prompt
acquiescence frightened her she felt behind it the stored force of a
patience that might subdue the strongest will But at least they had
parted amicably and he was out of the house without meeting
SeldenSelden whose continued absence now smote her with a new alarm
Rosedale had remained over an hour and she understood that it was now
too late to hope for Selden He would write explaining his absence of
course there would be a note from him by the late post But her
confession would have to be postponed and the chill of the delay settled
heavily on her fagged spirit

It lay heavier when the postmans last ring brought no note for her and
she had to go upstairs to a lonely nighta night as grim and sleepless
as her tortured fancy had pictured it to Gerty She had never learned to
live with her own thoughts and to be confronted with them through such
hours of lucid misery made the confused wretchedness of her previous
vigil seem easily bearable

Daylight disbanded the phantom crew and made it clear to her that she
would hear from Selden before noon but the day passed without his
writing or coming Lily remained at home lunching and dining alone with
her aunt who complained of flutterings of the heart and talked icily on
general topics Mrs Peniston went to bed early and when she had gone
Lily sat down and wrote a note to Selden She was about to ring for a
messenger to despatch it when her eye fell on a paragraph in the evening
paper which lay at her elbow Mr Lawrence Selden was among the
passengers sailing this afternoon for Havana and the West Indies on the
Windward Liner Antilles

She laid down the paper and sat motionless staring at her note She
understood now that he was never comingthat he had gone away because he
was afraid that he might come She rose and walking across the floor
stood gazing at herself for a long time in the brightlylit mirror above
the mantelpiece The lines in her face came out terriblyshe looked
old and when a girl looks old to herself how does she look to other
people She moved away and began to wander aimlessly about the room
fitting her steps with mechanical precision between the monstrous roses
of Mrs Penistons Axminster Suddenly she noticed that the pen with
which she had written to Selden still rested against the uncovered
inkstand She seated herself again and taking out an envelope addressed
it rapidly to Rosedale Then she laid out a sheet of paper and sat over
it with suspended pen It had been easy enough to write the date and
Dear Mr Rosedalebut after that her inspiration flagged She meant to
tell him to come to her but the words refused to shape themselves At
length she began I have been thinking then she laid the pen down
and sat with her elbows on the table and her face hidden in her hands

Suddenly she started up at the sound of the doorbell It was not
latebarely ten oclockand there might still be a note from Selden or
a messageor he might be there himself on the other side of the door
The announcement of his sailing might have been a mistakeit might be
another Lawrence Selden who had gone to Havanaall these possibilities
had time to flash through her mind and build up the conviction that she
was after all to see or hear from him before the drawingroom door
opened to admit a servant carrying a telegram

Lily tore it open with shaking hands and read Bertha Dorsets name below
the message Sailing unexpectedly tomorrow Will you join us on a cruise
in Mediterranean




 BOOK TWO


Chapter 1

It came vividly to Selden on the Casino steps that Monte Carlo had more
than any other place he knew the gift of accommodating itself to each
mans humour His own at the moment lent it a festive readiness of
welcome that might well in a disenchanted eye have turned to paint and
facility So frank an appeal for participationso outspoken a
recognition of the holiday vein in human naturestruck refreshingly on a
mind jaded by prolonged hard work in surroundings made for the discipline
of the senses As he surveyed the white square set in an exotic coquetry
of architecture the studied tropicality of the gardens the groups
loitering in the foreground against mauve mountains which suggested a
sublime stagesetting forgotten in a hurried shifting of scenesas he
took in the whole outspread effect of light and leisure he felt a
movement of revulsion from the last few months of his life

The New York winter had presented an interminable perspective of
snowburdened days reaching toward a spring of raw sunshine and furious
air when the ugliness of things rasped the eye as the gritty wind ground
into the skin Selden immersed in his work had told himself that
external conditions did not matter to a man in his state and that cold
and ugliness were a good tonic for relaxed sensibilities When an urgent
case summoned him abroad to confer with a client in Paris he broke
reluctantly with the routine of the office and it was only now that
having despatched his business and slipped away for a week in the south
he began to feel the renewed zest of spectatorship that is the solace of
those who take an objective interest in life

The multiplicity of its appealsthe perpetual surprise of its contrasts
and resemblances All these tricks and turns of the show were upon him
with a spring as he descended the Casino steps and paused on the pavement
at its doors He had not been abroad for seven yearsand what changes
the renewed contact produced If the central depths were untouched
hardly a pinpoint of surface remained the same And this was the very
place to bring out the completeness of the renewal The sublimities the
perpetuities might have left him as he was but this tent pitched for a
days revelry spread a roof of oblivion between himself and his fixed sky

It was midApril and one felt that the revelry had reached its climax
and that the desultory groups in the square and gardens would soon
dissolve and reform in other scenes Meanwhile the last moments of the
performance seemed to gain an added brightness from the hovering threat
of the curtain The quality of the air the exuberance of the flowers
the blue intensity of sea and sky produced the effect of a closing
TABLEAU when all the lights are turned on at once This impression was
presently heightened by the way in which a consciously conspicuous group
of people advanced to the middle front and stood before Selden with the
air of the chief performers gathered together by the exigencies of the
final effect Their appearance confirmed the impression that the show had
been staged regardless of expense and emphasized its resemblance to one
of those costumeplays in which the protagonists walk through the
passions without displacing a drapery The ladies stood in unrelated
attitudes calculated to isolate their effects and the men hung about
them as irrelevantly as stage heroes whose tailors are named in the
programme It was Selden himself who unwittingly fused the group by
arresting the attention of one of its members

Why Mr Selden Mrs Fisher exclaimed in surprise and with a gesture
toward Mrs Jack Stepney and Mrs Wellington Bry she added plaintively
Were starving to death because we cant decide where to lunch

Welcomed into their group and made the confidant of their difficulty
Selden learned with amusement that there were several places where one
might miss something by not lunching or forfeit something by lunching
so that eating actually became a minor consideration on the very spot
consecrated to its rites

Of course one gets the best things at the TERRASSEbut that looks as if
one hadnt any other reason for being there the Americans who dont know
any one always rush for the best food And the Duchess of Beltshire has
taken up Becassins lately Mrs Bry earnestly summed up

Mrs Bry to Mrs Fishers despair had not progressed beyond the point
of weighing her social alternatives in public She could not acquire the
air of doing things because she wanted to and making her choice the
final seal of their fitness

Mr Bry a short pale man with a business face and leisure clothes met
the dilemma hilariously

I guess the Duchess goes where its cheapest unless she can get her
meal paid for If you offered to blow her off at the TERRASSE shed turn
up fast enough

But Mrs Jack Stepney interposed The Grand Dukes go to that little
place at the Condamine Lord Hubert says its the only restaurant in
Europe where they can cook peas

Lord Hubert Dacey a slender shabbylooking man with a charming worn
smile and the air of having spent his best years in piloting the wealthy
to the right restaurant assented with gentle emphasis Its quite that

PEAS said Mr Bry contemptuously Can they cook terrapin It just
shows he continued what these European markets are when a fellow can
make a reputation cooking peas

Jack Stepney intervened with authority I dont know that I quite agree
with Dacey theres a little hole in Paris off the Quai Voltairebut in
any case I cant advise the Condamine GARGOTE at least not with ladies

Stepney since his marriage had thickened and grown prudish as the Van
Osburgh husbands were apt to do but his wife to his surprise and
discomfiture had developed an earthshaking fastness of gait which left
him trailing breathlessly in her wake

Thats where well go then she declared with a heavy toss of her
plumage Im so tired of the TERRASSE its as dull as one of mothers
dinners And Lord Hubert has promised to tell us who all the awful people
are at the other placehasnt he Carry Now Jack dont look so
solemn

Well said Mrs Bry all I want to know is who their dressmakers are

No doubt Dacey can tell you that too remarked Stepney with an ironic
intention which the other received with the light murmur I can at least
FIND OUT my dear fellow and Mrs Bry having declared that she couldnt
walk another step the party hailed two or three of the light phaetons
which hover attentively on the confines of the gardens and rattled off
in procession toward the Condamine

Their destination was one of the little restaurants overhanging the
boulevard which dips steeply down from Monte Carlo to the low
intermediate quarter along the quay From the window in which they
presently found themselves installed they overlooked the intense blue
curve of the harbour set between the verdure of twin promontories to
the right the cliff of Monaco topped by the mediaeval silhouette of its
church and castle to the left the terraces and pinnacles of the
gamblinghouse Between the two the waters of the bay were furrowed by a
light coming and going of pleasurecraft through which just at the
culminating moment of luncheon the majestic advance of a great
steamyacht drew the companys attention from the peas

By Jove I believe thats the Dorsets back Stepney exclaimed and Lord
Hubert dropping his single eyeglass corroborated Its the
Sabrinayes

So soon They were to spend a month in Sicily Mrs Fisher observed

I guess they feel as if they had theres only one uptodate hotel in
the whole place said Mr Bry disparagingly

It was Ned Silvertons ideabut poor Dorset and Lily Bart must have
been horribly bored Mrs Fisher added in an undertone to Selden I do
hope there hasnt been a row

Its most awfully jolly having Miss Bart back said Lord Hubert in his
mild deliberate voice and Mrs Bry added ingenuously I daresay the
Duchess will dine with us now that Lilys here

The Duchess admires her immensely Im sure shed be charmed to have it
arranged Lord Hubert agreed with the professional promptness of the
man accustomed to draw his profit from facilitating social contacts
Selden was struck by the businesslike change in his manner

Lily has been a tremendous success here Mrs Fisher continued still
addressing herself confidentially to Selden She looks ten years
youngerI never saw her so handsome Lady Skiddaw took her everywhere in
Cannes and the Crown Princess of Macedonia had her to stop for a week at
Cimiez People say that was one reason why Bertha whisked the yacht off
to Sicily the Crown Princess didnt take much notice of her and she
couldnt bear to look on at Lilys triumph

Selden made no reply He was vaguely aware that Miss Bart was cruising in
the Mediterranean with the Dorsets but it had not occurred to him that
there was any chance of running across her on the Riviera where the
season was virtually at an end As he leaned back silently contemplating
his filigree cup of Turkish coffee he was trying to put some order in
his thoughts to tell himself how the news of her nearness was really
affecting him He had a personal detachment enabling him even in moments
of emotional highpressure to get a fairly clear view of his feelings
and he was sincerely surprised by the disturbance which the sight of the
Sabrina had produced in him He had reason to think that his three months
of engrossing professional work following on the sharp shock of his
disillusionment had cleared his mind of its sentimental vapours The
feeling he had nourished and given prominence to was one of thankfulness
for his escape he was like a traveller so grateful for rescue from a
dangerous accident that at first he is hardly conscious of his bruises
Now he suddenly felt the latent ache and realized that after all he had
not come off unhurt

An hour later at Mrs Fishers side in the Casino gardens he was trying
to find fresh reasons for forgetting the injury received in the
contemplation of the peril avoided The party had dispersed with the
loitering indecision characteristic of social movements at Monte Carlo
where the whole place and the long gilded hours of the day seem to
offer an infinity of ways of being idle Lord Hubert Dacey had finally
gone off in quest of the Duchess of Beltshire charged by Mrs Bry with
the delicate negotiation of securing that ladys presence at dinner the
Stepneys had left for Nice in their motorcar and Mr Bry had departed
to take his place in the pigeon shooting match which was at the moment
engaging his highest faculties

Mrs Bry who had a tendency to grow red and stertorous after luncheon
had been judiciously prevailed upon by Carry Fisher to withdraw to her
hotel for an hours repose and Selden and his companion were thus left
to a stroll propitious to confidences The stroll soon resolved itself
into a tranquil session on a bench overhung with laurel and Banksian
roses from which they caught a dazzle of blue sea between marble
balusters and the fiery shafts of cactusblossoms shooting meteorlike
from the rock The soft shade of their niche and the adjacent glitter of
the air were conducive to an easy lounging mood and to the smoking of
many cigarettes and Selden yielding to these influences suffered Mrs
Fisher to unfold to him the history of her recent experiences She had
come abroad with the Welly Brys at the moment when fashion flees the
inclemency of the New York spring The Brys intoxicated by their first
success already thirsted for new kingdoms and Mrs Fisher viewing the
Riviera as an easy introduction to London society had guided their
course thither She had affiliations of her own in every capital and a
facility for picking them up again after long absences and the carefully
disseminated rumour of the Brys wealth had at once gathered about them a
group of cosmopolitan pleasureseekers

But things are not going as well as I expected Mrs Fisher frankly
admitted Its all very well to say that every body with money can get
into society but it would be truer to say that NEARLY everybody can
And the London market is so glutted with new Americans that to succeed
there now they must be either very clever or awfully queer The Brys are
neither HE would get on well enough if shed let him alone they like
his slang and his brag and his blunders But Louisa spoils it all by
trying to repress him and put herself forward If shed be natural
herselffat and vulgar and bouncingit would be all right but as soon
as she meets anybody smart she tries to be slender and queenly She
tried it with the Duchess of Beltshire and Lady Skiddaw and they fled
Ive done my best to make her see her mistakeIve said to her again and
again Just let yourself go Louisa but she keeps up the humbug even
with meI believe she keeps on being queenly in her own room with the
door shut

The worst of it is Mrs Fisher went on that she thinks its all MY
fault When the Dorsets turned up here six weeks ago and everybody began
to make a fuss about Lily Bart I could see Louisa thought that if shed
had Lily in tow instead of me she would have been hobnobbing with all
the royalties by this time She doesnt realize that its Lilys beauty
that does it Lord Hubert tells me Lily is thought even handsomer than
when he knew her at Aix ten years ago It seems she was tremendously
admired there An Italian Prince rich and the real thing wanted to
marry her but just at the critical moment a goodlooking stepson turned
up and Lily was silly enough to flirt with him while her
marriagesettlements with the stepfather were being drawn up Some
people said the young man did it on purpose You can fancy the scandal
there was an awful row between the men and people began to look at Lily
so queerly that Mrs Peniston had to pack up and finish her cure
elsewhere Not that SHE ever understood to this day she thinks that Aix
didnt suit her and mentions her having been sent there as proof of the
incompetence of French doctors Thats Lily all over you know she works
like a slave preparing the ground and sowing her seed but the day she
ought to be reaping the harvest she oversleeps herself or goes off on a
picnic

Mrs Fisher paused and looked reflectively at the deep shimmer of sea
between the cactusflowers Sometimes she added I think its just
flightinessand sometimes I think its because at heart she despises
the things shes trying for And its the difficulty of deciding that
makes her such an interesting study She glanced tentatively at Seldens
motionless profile and resumed with a slight sigh Well all I can say
is I wish shed give ME some of her discarded opportunities I wish we
could change places now for instance She could make a very good thing
out of the Brys if she managed them properly and I should know just how
to look after George Dorset while Bertha is reading Verlaine with Neddy
Silverton

She met Seldens sound of protest with a sharp derisive glance Well
whats the use of mincing matters We all know thats what Bertha brought
her abroad for When Bertha wants to have a good time she has to provide
occupation for George At first I thought Lily was going to play her
cards well THIS time but there are rumours that Bertha is jealous of her
success here and at Cannes and I shouldnt be surprised if there were a
break any day Lilys only safeguard is that Bertha needs her badlyoh
very badly The Silverton affair is in the acute stage its necessary
that Georges attention should be pretty continuously distracted And Im
bound to say Lily DOES distract it I believe hed marry her tomorrow if
he found out there was anything wrong with Bertha But you know himhes
as blind as hes jealous and of course Lilys present business is to
keep him blind A clever woman might know just the right moment to tear
off the bandage but Lily isnt clever in that way and when George does
open his eyes shell probably contrive not to be in his line of vision

Selden tossed away his cigarette By Joveits time for my train he
exclaimed with a glance at his watch adding in reply to Mrs Fishers
surprised commentWhy I thought of course you were at Montea
murmured word to the effect that he was making Nice his headquarters

The worst of it is she snubs the Brys now he heard irrelevantly flung
after him

Ten minutes later in the highperched bedroom of an hotel overlooking
the Casino he was tossing his effects into a couple of gaping
portmanteaux while the porter waited outside to transport them to the
cab at the door It took but a brief plunge down the steep white road to
the station to land him safely in the afternoon express for Nice and not
till he was installed in the corner of an empty carriage did he exclaim
to himself with a reaction of selfcontempt What the deuce am I
running away from

The pertinence of the question checked Seldens fugitive impulse before
the train had started It was ridiculous to be flying like an emotional
coward from an infatuation his reason had conquered He had instructed
his bankers to forward some important business letters to Nice and at
Nice he would quietly await them He was already annoyed with himself for
having left Monte Carlo where he had intended to pass the week which
remained to him before sailing but it would now be difficult to return
on his steps without an appearance of inconsistency from which his pride
recoiled In his inmost heart he was not sorry to put himself beyond the
probability of meeting Miss Bart Completely as he had detached himself
from her he could not yet regard her merely as a social instance and
viewed in a more personal ways she was not likely to be a reassuring
object of study Chance encounters or even the repeated mention of her
name would send his thoughts back into grooves from which he had
resolutely detached them whereas if she could be entirely excluded from
his life the pressure of new and varied impressions with which no
thought of her was connected would soon complete the work of separation
Mrs Fishers conversation had indeed operated to that end but the
treatment was too painful to be voluntarily chosen while milder remedies
were untried and Selden thought he could trust himself to return
gradually to a reasonable view of Miss Bart if only he did not see her

Having reached the station early he had arrived at this point in his
reflections before the increasing throng on the platform warned him that
he could not hope to preserve his privacy the next moment there was a
hand on the door and he turned to confront the very face he was fleeing

Miss Bart glowing with the haste of a precipitate descent upon the
train headed a group composed of the Dorsets young Silverton and Lord
Hubert Dacey who had barely time to spring into the carriage and
envelop Selden in ejaculations of surprise and welcome before the
whistle of departure sounded The party it appeared were hastening to
Nice in response to a sudden summons to dine with the Duchess of
Beltshire and to see the waterfete in the bay a plan evidently
improvisedin spite of Lord Huberts protesting Oh I say you
knowfor the express purpose of defeating Mrs Brys endeavour to
capture the Duchess

During the laughing relation of this manoeuvre Selden had time for a
rapid impression of Miss Bart who had seated herself opposite to him in
the golden afternoon light Scarcely three months had elapsed since he
had parted from her on the threshold of the Brys conservatory but a
subtle change had passed over the quality of her beauty Then it had had
a transparency through which the fluctuations of the spirit were
sometimes tragically visible now its impenetrable surface suggested a
process of crystallization which had fused her whole being into one hard
brilliant substance The change had struck Mrs Fisher as a rejuvenation
to Selden it seemed like that moment of pause and arrest when the warm
fluidity of youth is chilled into its final shape

He felt it in the way she smiled on him and in the readiness and
competence with which flung unexpectedly into his presence she took up
the thread of their intercourse as though that thread had not been
snapped with a violence from which he still reeled Such facility
sickened himbut he told himself that it was with the pang which
precedes recovery Now he would really get wellwould eject the last
drop of poison from his blood Already he felt himself calmer in her
presence than he had learned to be in the thought of her Her assumptions
and elisions her shortcuts and long DETOURS the skill with which she
contrived to meet him at a point from which no inconvenient glimpses of
the past were visible suggested what opportunities she had had for
practising such arts since their last meeting He felt that she had at
last arrived at an understanding with herself had made a pact with her
rebellious impulses and achieved a uniform system of selfgovernment
under which all vagrant tendencies were either held captive or forced
into the service of the state

And he saw other things too in her manner saw how it had adjusted itself
to the hidden intricacies of a situation in which even after Mrs
Fishers elucidating flashes he still felt himself agrope Surely Mrs
Fisher could no longer charge Miss Bart with neglecting her
opportunities To Seldens exasperated observation she was only too
completely alive to them She was perfect to every one subservient to
Berthas anxious predominance goodnaturedly watchful of Dorsets moods
brightly companionable to Silverton and Dacey the latter of whom met her
on an evident footing of old admiration while young Silverton
portentously selfabsorbed seemed conscious of her only as of something
vaguely obstructive And suddenly as Selden noted the fine shades of
manner by which she harmonized herself with her surroundings it flashed
on him that to need such adroit handling the situation must indeed be
desperate She was on the edge of somethingthat was the impression left
with him He seemed to see her poised on the brink of a chasm with one
graceful foot advanced to assert her unconsciousness that the ground was
failing her

On the Promenade des Anglais where Ned Silverton hung on him for the
half hour before dinner he received a deeper impression of the general
insecurity Silverton was in a mood of Titanic pessimism How any one
could come to such a damned hole as the Rivieraany one with a grain of
imaginationwith the whole Mediterranean to choose from but then if
ones estimate of a place depended on the way they broiled a spring
chicken Gad what a study might be made of the tyranny of the
stomachthe way a sluggish liver or insufficient gastric juices might
affect the whole course of the universe overshadow everything in
reachchronic dyspepsia ought to be among the statutory causes a
womans life might be ruined by a mans inability to digest fresh bread
Grotesque Yesand tragiclike most absurdities Theres nothing
grimmer than the tragedy that wears a comic mask Where was he
Ohthe reason they chucked Sicily and rushed back Wellpartly no
doubt Miss Barts desire to get back to bridge and smartness Dead as a
stone to art and poetrythe light never WAS on sea or land for her And
of course she persuaded Dorset that the Italian food was bad for him Oh
she could make him believe anythingANYTHING Mrs Dorset was aware of
itoh perfectly nothing SHE didnt see But she could hold her
tongueshed had to often enough Miss Bart was an intimate friendshe
wouldnt hear a word against her Only it hurts a womans pridethere
are some things one doesnt get used to    All this in confidence of
course Ahand there were the ladies signalling from the balcony of the
hotel He plunged across the Promenade leaving Selden to a meditative
cigar

The conclusions it led him to were fortified later in the evening by
some of those faint corroborative hints that generate a light of their
own in the dusk of a doubting mind Selden stumbling on a chance
acquaintance had dined with him and adjourned still in his company to
the brightly lit Promenade where a line of crowded stands commanded the
glittering darkness of the waters The night was soft and persuasive
Overhead hung a summer sky furrowed with the rush of rockets and from
the east a late moon pushing up beyond the lofty bend of the coast sent
across the bay a shaft of brightness which paled to ashes in the red
glitter of the illuminated boats Down the lanternhung Promenade
snatches of bandmusic floated above the hum of the crowd and the soft
tossing of boughs in dusky gardens and between these gardens and the
backs of the stands there flowed a stream of people in whom the
vociferous carnival mood seemed tempered by the growing languor of the
season

Selden and his companion unable to get seats on one of the stands facing
the bay had wandered for a while with the throng and then found a point
of vantage on a high gardenparapet above the Promenade Thence they
caught but a triangular glimpse of the water and of the flashing play of
boats across its surface but the crowd in the street was under their
immediate view and seemed to Selden on the whole of more interest than
the show itself After a while however he wearied of his perch and
dropping alone to the pavement pushed his way to the first corner and
turned into the moonlit silence of a side street Long gardenwalls
overhung by trees made a dark boundary to the pavement an empty cab
trailed along the deserted thoroughfare and presently Selden saw two
persons emerge from the opposite shadows signal to the cab and drive
off in it toward the centre of the town The moonlight touched them as
they paused to enter the carriage and he recognized Mrs Dorset and
young Silverton

Beneath the nearest lamppost he glanced at his watch and saw that the
time was close on eleven He took another cross street and without
breasting the throng on the Promenade made his way to the fashionable
club which overlooks that thoroughfare Here amid the blaze of crowded
baccarat tables he caught sight of Lord Hubert Dacey seated with his
habitual worn smile behind a rapidly dwindling heap of gold The heap
being in due course wiped out Lord Hubert rose with a shrug and joining
Selden adjourned with him to the deserted terrace of the club It was
now past midnight and the throng on the stands was dispersing while the
long trails of redlit boats scattered and faded beneath a sky
repossessed by the tranquil splendour of the moon

Lord Hubert looked at his watch By Jove I promised to join the Duchess
for supper at the LONDON HOUSE but its past twelve and I suppose
theyve all scattered The fact is I lost them in the crowd soon after
dinner and took refuge here for my sins They had seats on one of the
stands but of course they couldnt stop quiet the Duchess never can
She and Miss Bart went off in quest of what they call adventuresgad it
aint their fault if they dont have some queer ones He added
tentatively after pausing to grope for a cigarette Miss Barts an old
friend of yours I believe So she told meAh thanksI dont seem to
have one left He lit Seldens proffered cigarette and continued in
his highpitched drawling tone None of my business of course but I
didnt introduce her to the Duchess Charming woman the Duchess you
understand and a very good friend of mine but RATHER a liberal
education

Selden received this in silence and after a few puffs Lord Hubert broke
out again Sort of thing one cant communicate to the young ladythough
young ladies nowadays are so competent to judge for themselves but in
this caseIm an old friend too you know    and there seemed no one
else to speak to The whole situations a little mixed as I see itbut
there used to be an aunt somewhere a diffuse and innocent person who
was great at bridging over chasms she didnt see    Ah in New York
is she Pity New Yorks such a long way off



Chapter 2

Miss Bart emerging late the next morning from her cabin found herself
alone on the deck of the Sabrina The cushioned chairs disposed
expectantly under the wide awning showed no signs of recent occupancy
and she presently learned from a steward that Mrs Dorset had not yet
appeared and that the gentlemenseparatelyhad gone ashore as soon as
they had breakfasted Supplied with these facts Lily leaned awhile over
the side giving herself up to a leisurely enjoyment of the spectacle
before her Unclouded sunlight enveloped sea and shore in a bath of
purest radiancy The purpling waters drew a sharp white line of foam at
the base of the shore against its irregular eminences hotels and villas
flashed from the greyish verdure of olive and eucalyptus and the
background of bare and finelypencilled mountains quivered in a pale
intensity of light


How beautiful it wasand how she loved beauty She had always felt that
her sensibility in this direction made up for certain obtusenesses of
feeling of which she was less proud and during the last three months she
had indulged it passionately The Dorsets invitation to go abroad with
them had come as an almost miraculous release from crushing difficulties
and her faculty for renewing herself in new scenes and casting off
problems of conduct as easily as the surroundings in which they had
arisen made the mere change from one place to another seem not merely a
postponement but a solution of her troubles Moral complications existed
for her only in the environment that had produced them she did not mean
to slight or ignore them but they lost their reality when they changed
their background She could not have remained in New York without
repaying the money she owed to Trenor to acquit herself of that odious
debt she might even have faced a marriage with Rosedale but the accident
of placing the Atlantic between herself and her obligations made them
dwindle out of sight as if they had been milestones and she had travelled
past them

Her two months on the Sabrina had been especially calculated to aid this
illusion of distance She had been plunged into new scenes and had found
in them a renewal of old hopes and ambitions The cruise itself charmed
her as a romantic adventure She was vaguely touched by the names and
scenes amid which she moved and had listened to Ned Silverton reading
Theocritus by moonlight as the yacht rounded the Sicilian promontories
with a thrill of the nerves that confirmed her belief in her intellectual
superiority But the weeks at Cannes and Nice had really given her more
pleasure The gratification of being welcomed in high company and of
making her own ascendency felt there so that she found herself figuring
once more as the beautiful Miss Bart in the interesting journal devoted
to recording the least movements of her cosmopolitan companionsall
these experiences tended to throw into the extreme background of memory
the prosaic and sordid difficulties from which she had escaped

If she was faintly aware of fresh difficulties ahead she was sure of her
ability to meet them it was characteristic of her to feel that the only
problems she could not solve were those with which she was familiar
Meanwhile she could honestly be proud of the skill with which she had
adapted herself to somewhat delicate conditions She had reason to think
that she had made herself equally necessary to her host and hostess and
if only she had seen any perfectly irreproachable means of drawing a
financial profit from the situation there would have been no cloud on
her horizon The truth was that her funds as usual were inconveniently
low and to neither Dorset nor his wife could this vulgar embarrassment
be safely hinted Still the need was not a pressing one she could worry
along as she had so often done before with the hope of some happy
change of fortune to sustain her and meanwhile life was gay and
beautiful and easy and she was conscious of figuring not unworthily in
such a setting

She was engaged to breakfast that morning with the Duchess of Beltshire
and at twelve oclock she asked to be set ashore in the gig Before this
she had sent her maid to enquire if she might see Mrs Dorset but the
reply came back that the latter was tired and trying to sleep Lily
thought she understood the reason of the rebuff Her hostess had not been
included in the Duchesss invitation though she herself had made the
most loyal efforts in that direction But her grace was impervious to
hints and invited or omitted as she chose It was not Lilys fault if
Mrs Dorsets complicated attitudes did not fall in with the Duchesss
easy gait The Duchess who seldom explained herself had not formulated
her objection beyond saying Shes rather a bore you know The only one
of your friends I like is that little Mr BryHES funny but Lily
knew enough not to press the point and was not altogether sorry to be
thus distinguished at her friends expense Bertha certainly HAD grown
tiresome since she had taken to poetry and Ned Silverton

On the whole it was a relief to break away now and then from the
Sabrina and the Duchesss little breakfast organized by Lord Hubert
with all his usual virtuosity was the pleasanter to Lily for not
including her travellingcompanions Dorset of late had grown more than
usually morose and incalculable and Ned Silverton went about with an air
that seemed to challenge the universe The freedom and lightness of the
ducal intercourse made an agreeable change from these complications and
Lily was tempted after luncheon to adjourn in the wake of her
companions to the hectic atmosphere of the Casino She did not mean to
play her diminished pocketmoney offered small scope for the adventure
but it amused her to sit on a divan under the doubtful protection of the
Duchesss back while the latter hung above her stakes at a neighbouring
table

The rooms were packed with the gazing throng which in the afternoon
hours trickles heavily between the tables like the Sunday crowd in a
lionhouse In the stagnant flow of the mass identities were hardly
distinguishable but Lily presently saw Mrs Bry cleaving her determined
way through the doors and in the broad wake she left the light figure
of Mrs Fisher bobbing after her like a rowboat at the stern of a tug
Mrs Bry pressed on evidently animated by the resolve to reach a certain
point in the rooms but Mrs Fisher as she passed Lily broke from her
towingline and let herself float to the girls side

Lose her she echoed the latters query with an indifferent glance at
Mrs Brys retreating back I daresayit doesnt matter I HAVE lost
her already And as Lily exclaimed she added We had an awful row
this morning You know of course that the Duchess chucked her at dinner
last night and she thinks it was my faultmy want of management The
worst of it is the messagejust a mere word by telephonecame so late
that the dinner HAD to be paid for and Becassin HAD run it upit had
been so drummed into him that the Duchess was coming Mrs Fisher
indulged in a faint laugh at the remembrance Paying for what she
doesnt get rankles so dreadfully with Louisa I cant make her see that
its one of the preliminary steps to getting what you havent paid
forand as I was the nearest thing to smash she smashed me to atoms
poor dear

Lily murmured her commiseration Impulses of sympathy came naturally to
her and it was instinctive to proffer her help to Mrs Fisher

If theres anything I can doif its only a question of meeting the
Duchess I heard her say she thought Mr Bry amusing

But Mrs Fisher interposed with a decisive gesture My dear I have my
pride the pride of my trade I couldnt manage the Duchess and I cant
palm off your arts on Louisa Bry as mine Ive taken the final step I
go to Paris tonight with the Sam Gormers THEYRE still in the elementary
stage an Italian Prince is a great deal more than a Prince to them and
theyre always on the brink of taking a courier for one To save them
from that is my present mission She laughed again at the picture But
before I go I want to make my last will and testamentI want to leave
you the Brys

Me Miss Bart joined in her amusement Its charming of you to
remember me dear but really

Youre already so well provided for Mrs Fisher flashed a sharp glance
at her ARE you though Lilyto the point of rejecting my offer

Miss Bart coloured slowly What I really meant was that the Brys
wouldnt in the least care to be so disposed of

Mrs Fisher continued to probe her embarrassment with an unflinching eye
What you really meant was that youve snubbed the Brys horribly and you
know that they know

Carry

Oh on certain sides Louisa bristles with perceptions If youd even
managed to have them asked once on the Sabrinaespecially when royalties
were coming But its not too late she ended earnestly its not too
late for either of you

Lily smiled Stay over and Ill get the Duchess to dine with them

I shant stay overthe Gormers have paid for my SALONLIT said Mrs
Fisher with simplicity But get the Duchess to dine with them all the
same

Lilys smile again flowed into a slight laugh her friends importunity
was beginning to strike her as irrelevant Im sorry I have been
negligent about the Brys she began

Oh as to the Brysits you Im thinking of said Mrs Fisher
abruptly She paused and then bending forward with a lowered voice
You know we all went on to Nice last night when the Duchess chucked us
It was Louisas ideaI told her what I thought of it

Miss Bart assented YesI caught sight of you on the way back at the
station

Well the man who was in the carriage with you and George Dorsetthat
horrid little Dabham who does Society Notes from the Rivierahad been
dining with us at Nice And hes telling everybody that you and Dorset
came back alone after midnight

Alone When he was with us Lily laughed but her laugh faded into
gravity under the prolonged implication of Mrs Fishers look We DID
come back aloneif thats so very dreadful But whose fault was it The
Duchess was spending the night at Cimiez with the Crown Princess Bertha
got bored with the show and went off early promising to meet us at the
station We turned up on time but she didntshe didnt turn up at all

Miss Bart made this announcement in the tone of one who presents with
careless assurance a complete vindication but Mrs Fisher received it
in a manner almost inconsequent She seemed to have lost sight of her
friends part in the incident her inward vision had taken another slant

Bertha never turned up at all Then how on earth did she get back

Oh by the next train I suppose there were two extra ones for the
FETE At any rate I know shes safe on the yacht though I havent yet
seen her but you see it was not my fault Lily summed up

Not your fault that Bertha didnt turn up My poor child if only you
dont have to pay for it Mrs Fisher roseshe had seen Mrs Bry
surging back in her direction Theres Louisa and I must be offoh
were on the best of terms externally were lunching together but at
heart its ME shes lunching on she explained and with a last
handclasp and a last look she added Remember I leave her to you
shes hovering now ready to take you in



Lily carried the impression of Mrs Fishers leavetaking away with her
from the Casino doors She had accomplished before leaving the first
step toward her reinstatement in Mrs Brys good graces An affable
advancea vague murmur that they must see more of each otheran
allusive glance to a near future that was felt to include the Duchess as
well as the Sabrinahow easily it was all done if one possessed the
knack of doing it She wondered at herself as she had so often
wondered that possessing the knack she did not more consistently
exercise it But sometimes she was forgetfuland sometimes could it be
that she was proud Today at any rate she had been vaguely conscious of
a reason for sinking her pride had in fact even sunk it to the point of
suggesting to Lord Hubert Dacey whom she ran across on the Casino steps
that he might really get the Duchess to dine with the Brys if SHE
undertook to have them asked on the Sabrina Lord Hubert had promised his
help with the readiness on which she could always count it was his only
way of ever reminding her that he had once been ready to do so much more
for her Her path in short seemed to smooth itself before her as she
advanced yet the faint stir of uneasiness persisted Had it been
produced she wondered by her chance meeting with Selden She thought
nottime and change seemed so completely to have relegated him to his
proper distance The sudden and exquisite reaction from her anxieties had
had the effect of throwing the recent past so far back that even Selden
as part of it retained a certain air of unreality And he had made it so
clear that they were not to meet again that he had merely dropped down
to Nice for a day or two and had almost his foot on the next steamer
Nothat part of the past had merely surged up for a moment on the
fleeing surface of events and now that it was submerged again the
uncertainty the apprehension persisted

They grew to sudden acuteness as she caught sight of George Dorset
descending the steps of the Hotel de Paris and making for her across the
square She had meant to drive down to the quay and regain the yacht but
she now had the immediate impression that something more was to happen
first

Which way are you going Shall we walk a bit he began putting the
second question before the first was answered and not waiting for a
reply to either before he directed her silently toward the comparative
seclusion of the lower gardens

She detected in him at once all the signs of extreme nervous tension
The skin was puffed out under his sunken eyes and its sallowness had
paled to a leaden white against which his irregular eyebrows and long
reddish moustache were relieved with a saturnine effect His appearance
in short presented an odd mixture of the bedraggled and the ferocious

He walked beside her in silence with quick precipitate steps till they
reached the embowered slopes to the east of the Casino then pulling up
abruptly he said Have you seen Bertha

Nowhen I left the yacht she was not yet up

He received this with a laugh like the whirring sound in a disabled
clock Not yet up Had she gone to bed Do you know at what time she
came on board This morning at seven he exclaimed

At seven Lily started What happenedan accident to the train

He laughed again They missed the trainall the trainsthey had to
drive back

Well She hesitated feeling at once how little even this necessity
accounted for the fatal lapse of hours

Well they couldnt get a carriage at onceat that time of night you
know the explanatory note made it almost seem as though he were
putting the case for his wifeand when they finally did it was only a
onehorse cab and the horse was lame

How tiresome I see she affirmed with the more earnestness because
she was so nervously conscious that she did not and after a pause she
added Im so sorrybut ought we to have waited

Waited for the onehorse cab It would scarcely have carried the four of
us do you think

She took this in what seemed the only possible way with a laugh intended
to sink the question itself in his humorous treatment of it Well it
would have been difficult we should have had to walk by turns But it
would have been jolly to see the sunrise

Yes the sunrise WAS jolly he agreed

Was it You saw it then

I saw it yes from the deck I waited up for them

NaturallyI suppose you were worried Why didnt you call on me to
share your vigil

He stood still dragging at his moustache with a lean weak hand I
dont think you would have cared for its DENOUEMENT he said with sudden
grimness

Again she was disconcerted by the abrupt change in his tone and as in
one flash she saw the peril of the moment and the need of keeping her
sense of it out of her eyes

DENOUEMENTisnt that too big a word for such a small incident The
worst of it after all is the fatigue which Bertha has probably slept
off by this time

She clung to the note bravely though its futility was now plain to her
in the glare of his miserable eyes

Dontdont he broke out with the hurt cry of a child and while
she tried to merge her sympathy and her resolve to ignore any cause for
it in one ambiguous murmur of deprecation he dropped down on the bench
near which they had paused and poured out the wretchedness of his soul

It was a dreadful houran hour from which she emerged shrinking and
seared as though her lids had been scorched by its actual glare It was
not that she had never had premonitory glimpses of such an outbreak but
rather because here and there throughout the three months the surface
of life had shown such ominous cracks and vapours that her fears had
always been on the alert for an upheaval There had been moments when the
situation had presented itself under a homelier yet more vivid
imagethat of a shaky vehicle dashed by unbroken steeds over a bumping
road while she cowered within aware that the harness wanted mending
and wondering what would give way first Welleverything had given way
now and the wonder was that the crazy outfit had held together so long
Her sense of being involved in the crash instead of merely witnessing it
from the road was intensified by the way in which Dorset through his
furies of denunciation and wild reactions of selfcontempt made her feel
the need he had of her the place she had taken in his life But for her
what ear would have been open to his cries And what hand but hers could
drag him up again to a footing of sanity and selfrespect All through
the stress of the struggle with him she had been conscious of something
faintly maternal in her efforts to guide and uplift him But for the
present if he clung to her it was not in order to be dragged up but to
feel some one floundering in the depths with him he wanted her to suffer
with him not to help him to suffer less

Happily for both there was little physical strength to sustain his
frenzy It left him collapsed and breathing heavily to an apathy so
deep and prolonged that Lily almost feared the passersby would think it
the result of a seizure and stop to offer their aid But Monte Carlo is
of all places the one where the human bond is least close and odd
sights are the least arresting If a glance or two lingered on the
couple no intrusive sympathy disturbed them and it was Lily herself who
broke the silence by rising from her seat With the clearing of her
vision the sweep of peril had extended and she saw that the post of
danger was no longer at Dorsets side

If you wont go back I mustdont make me leave you she urged

But he remained mutely resistant and she added What are you going to
do You really cant sit here all night

I can go to an hotel I can telegraph my lawyers He sat up roused by
a new thought By Jove Seldens at NiceIll send for Selden

Lily at this reseated herself with a cry of alarm No no NO she
protested

He swung round on her distrustfully Why not Selden Hes a lawyer isnt
he One will do as well as another in a case like this

As badly as another you mean I thought you relied on ME to help you

You doby being so sweet and patient with me If it hadnt been for you
Id have ended the thing long ago But now its got to end He rose
suddenly straightening himself with an effort You cant want to see
me ridiculous

She looked at him kindly Thats just it Then after a moments
pondering almost to her own surprise she broke out with a flash of
inspiration Well go over and see Mr Selden Youll have time to do it
before dinner

Oh DINNER he mocked her but she left him with the smiling
rejoinder Dinner on board remember well put it off till nine if you
like

It was past four already and when a cab had dropped her at the quay and
she stood waiting for the gig to put off for her she began to wonder
what had been happening on the yacht Of Silvertons whereabouts there
had been no mention Had he returned to the Sabrina Or could Berthathe
dread alternative sprang on her suddenlycould Bertha left to herself
have gone ashore to rejoin him Lilys heart stood still at the thought
All her concern had hitherto been for young Silverton not only because
in such affairs the womans instinct is to side with the man but
because his case made a peculiar appeal to her sympathies He was so
desperately in earnest poor youth and his earnestness was of so
different a quality from Berthas though hers too was desperate enough
The difference was that Bertha was in earnest only about herself while
he was in earnest about her But now at the actual crisis this
difference seemed to throw the weight of destitution on Berthas side
since at least he had her to suffer for and she had only herself At any
rate viewed less ideally all the disadvantages of such a situation were
for the woman and it was to Bertha that Lilys sympathies now went out
She was not fond of Bertha Dorset but neither was she without a sense of
obligation the heavier for having so little personal liking to sustain
it Bertha had been kind to her they had lived together during the last
months on terms of easy friendship and the sense of friction of which
Lily had recently become aware seemed to make it the more urgent that she
should work undividedly in her friends interest

It was in Berthas interest certainly that she had despatched Dorset to
consult with Lawrence Selden Once the grotesqueness of the situation
accepted she had seen at a glance that it was the safest in which Dorset
could find himself Who but Selden could thus miraculously combine the
skill to save Bertha with the obligation of doing so The consciousness
that much skill would be required made Lily rest thankfully in the
greatness of the obligation Since he would HAVE to pull Bertha through
she could trust him to find a way and she put the fulness of her trust
in the telegram she managed to send him on her way to the quay

Thus far then Lily felt that she had done well and the conviction
strengthened her for the task that remained She and Bertha had never
been on confidential terms but at such a crisis the barriers of reserve
must surely fall Dorsets wild allusions to the scene of the morning
made Lily feel that they were down already and that any attempt to
rebuild them would be beyond Berthas strength She pictured the poor
creature shivering behind her fallen defences and awaiting with suspense
the moment when she could take refuge in the first shelter that offered
If only that shelter had not already offered itself elsewhere As the gig
traversed the short distance between the quay and the yacht Lily grew
more than ever alarmed at the possible consequences of her long absence
What if the wretched Bertha finding in all the long hours no soul to
turn tobut by this time Lilys eager foot was on the sideladder and
her first step on the Sabrina showed the worst of her apprehensions to be
unfounded for there in the luxurious shade of the afterdeck the
wretched Bertha in full command of her usual attenuated elegance sat
dispensing tea to the Duchess of Beltshire and Lord Hubert

The sight filled Lily with such surprise that she felt that Bertha at
least must read its meaning in her look and she was proportionately
disconcerted by the blankness of the look returned But in an instant she
saw that Mrs Dorset had of necessity to look blank before the others
and that to mitigate the effect of her own surprise she must at once
produce some simple reason for it The long habit of rapid transitions
made it easy for her to exclaim to the Duchess Why I thought youd
gone back to the Princess and this sufficed for the lady she addressed
if it was hardly enough for Lord Hubert

At least it opened the way to a lively explanation of how the Duchess
was in fact going back the next moment but had first rushed out to the
yacht for a word with Mrs Dorset on the subject of tomorrows
dinnerthe dinner with the Brys to which Lord Hubert had finally
insisted on dragging them

To save my neck you know he explained with a glance that appealed to
Lily for some recognition of his promptness and the Duchess added with
her noble candour Mr Bry has promised him a tip and he says if we go
hell pass it onto us

This led to some final pleasantries in which as it seemed to Lily Mrs
Dorset bore her part with astounding bravery and at the close of which
Lord Hubert from half way down the sideladder called back with an air
of numbering heads And of course we may count on Dorset too

Oh count on him his wife assented gaily She was keeping up well to
the lastbut as she turned back from waving her adieux over the side
Lily said to herself that the mask must drop and the soul of fear look
out

Mrs Dorset turned back slowly perhaps she wanted time to steady her
muscles at any rate they were still under perfect control when
dropping once more into her seat behind the teatable she remarked to
Miss Bart with a faint touch of irony I suppose I ought to say good
morning

If it was a cue Lily was ready to take it though with only the vaguest
sense of what was expected of her in return There was something
unnerving in the contemplation of Mrs Dorsets composure and she had to
force the light tone in which she answered I tried to see you this
morning but you were not yet up

NoI got to bed late After we missed you at the station I thought we
ought to wait for you till the last train She spoke very gently but
with just the least tinge of reproach

You missed us You waited for us at the station Now indeed Lily was
too far adrift in bewilderment to measure the others words or keep watch
on her own But I thought you didnt get to the station till after the
last train had left

Mrs Dorset examining her between lowered lids met this with the
immediate query Who told you that

GeorgeI saw him just now in the gardens

Ah is that Georges version Poor Georgehe was in no state to
remember what I told him He had one of his worst attacks this morning
and I packed him off to see the doctor Do you know if he found him

Lily still lost in conjecture made no reply and Mrs Dorset settled
herself indolently in her seat Hell wait to see him he was horribly
frightened about himself Its very bad for him to be worried and
whenever anything upsetting happens it always brings on an attack

This time Lily felt sure that a cue was being pressed on her but it was
put forth with such startling suddenness and with so incredible an air
of ignoring what it led up to that she could only falter out doubtfully
Anything upsetting

Yessuch as having you so conspicuously on his hands in the small
hours You know my dear youre rather a big responsibility in such a
scandalous place after midnight

At thatat the complete unexpectedness and the inconceivable audacity of
itLily could not restrain the tribute of an astonished laugh

Well reallyconsidering it was you who burdened him with the
responsibility

Mrs Dorset took this with an exquisite mildness By not having the
superhuman cleverness to discover you in that frightful rush for the
train Or the imagination to believe that youd take it without usyou
and he all aloneinstead of waiting quietly in the station till we DID
manage to meet you

Lilys colour rose it was growing clear to her that Bertha was pursuing
an object following a line she had marked out for herself Only with
such a doom impending why waste time in these childish efforts to avert
it The puerility of the attempt disarmed Lilys indignation did it not
prove how horribly the poor creature was frightened

No by our simply all keeping together at Nice she returned

Keeping together When it was you who seized the first opportunity to
rush off with the Duchess and her friends My dear Lily you are not a
child to be led by the hand

Nonor to be lectured Bertha really if thats what you are doing to
me now

Mrs Dorset smiled on her reproachfully Lecture youI Heaven forbid
I was merely trying to give you a friendly hint But its usually the
other way round isnt it Im expected to take hints not to give them
Ive positively lived on them all these last months

Hintsfrom me to you Lily repeated

Oh negative ones merelywhat not to be and to do and to see And I
think Ive taken them to admiration Only my dear if youll let me say
so I didnt understand that one of my negative duties was NOT to warn
you when you carried your imprudence too far

A chill of fear passed over Miss Bart a sense of remembered treachery
that was like the gleam of a knife in the dusk But compassion in a
moment got the better of her instinctive recoil What was this
outpouring of senseless bitterness but the tracked creatures attempt to
cloud the medium through which it was fleeing It was on Lilys lips to
exclaim You poor soul dont double and turncome straight back to me
and well find a way out But the words died under the impenetrable
insolence of Berthas smile Lily sat silent taking the brunt of it
quietly letting it spend itself on her to the last drop of its
accumulated falseness then without a word she rose and went down to
her cabin



Chapter 3

Miss Barts telegram caught Lawrence Selden at the door of his hotel and
having read it he turned back to wait for Dorset The message
necessarily left large gaps for conjecture but all that he had recently
heard and seen made these but too easy to fill in On the whole he was
surprised for though he had perceived that the situation contained all
the elements of an explosion he had often enough in the range of his
personal experience seen just such combinations subside into
harmlessness Still Dorsets spasmodic temper and his wifes reckless
disregard of appearances gave the situation a peculiar insecurity and
it was less from the sense of any special relation to the case than from
a purely professional zeal that Selden resolved to guide the pair to
safety Whether in the present instance safety for either lay in
repairing so damaged a tie it was no business of his to consider he had
only on general principles to think of averting a scandal and his
desire to avert it was increased by his fear of its involving Miss Bart
There was nothing specific in this apprehension he merely wished to
spare her the embarrassment of being ever so remotely connected with the
public washing of the Dorset linen

How exhaustive and unpleasant such a process would be he saw even more
vividly after his two hours talk with poor Dorset If anything came out
at all it would be such a vast unpacking of accumulated moral rags as
left him after his visitor had gone with the feeling that he must fling
open the windows and have his room swept out But nothing should come
out and happily for his side of the case the dirty rags however pieced
together could not without considerable difficulty be turned into a
homogeneous grievance The torn edges did not always fitthere were
missing bits there were disparities of size and colour all of which it
was naturally Seldens business to make the most of in putting them under
his clients eye But to a man in Dorsets mood the completest
demonstration could not carry conviction and Selden saw that for the
moment all he could do was to soothe and temporize to offer sympathy and
to counsel prudence He let Dorset depart charged to the brim with the
sense that till their next meeting he must maintain a strictly
noncommittal attitude that in short his share in the game consisted
for the present in looking on Selden knew however that he could not
long keep such violences in equilibrium and he promised to meet Dorset
the next morning at an hotel in Monte Carlo Meanwhile he counted not a
little on the reaction of weakness and selfdistrust that in such
natures follows on every unwonted expenditure of moral force and his
telegraphic reply to Miss Bart consisted simply in the injunction
Assume that everything is as usual

On this assumption in fact the early part of the following day was
lived through Dorset as if in obedience to Lilys imperative bidding
had actually returned in time for a late dinner on the yacht The repast
had been the most difficult moment of the day Dorset was sunk in one of
the abysmal silences which so commonly followed on what his wife called
his attacks that it was easy before the servants to refer it to this
cause but Bertha herself seemed perversely enough little disposed to
make use of this obvious means of protection She simply left the brunt
of the situation on her husbands hands as if too absorbed in a
grievance of her own to suspect that she might be the object of one
herself To Lily this attitude was the most ominous because the most
perplexing element in the situation As she tried to fan the weak
flicker of talk to build up again and again the crumbling structure of
appearances her own attention was perpetually distracted by the
question What on earth can she be driving at There was something
positively exasperating in Berthas attitude of isolated defiance If
only she would have given her friend a hint they might still have worked
together successfully but how could Lily be of use while she was thus
obstinately shut out from participation To be of use was what she
honestly wanted and not for her own sake but for the Dorsets She had
not thought of her own situation at all she was simply engrossed in
trying to put a little order in theirs But the close of the short dreary
evening left her with a sense of effort hopelessly wasted She had not
tried to see Dorset alone she had positively shrunk from a renewal of
his confidences It was Bertha whose confidence she sought and who
should as eagerly have invited her own and Bertha as if in the
infatuation of selfdestruction was actually pushing away her rescuing
hand

Lily going to bed early had left the couple to themselves and it
seemed part of the general mystery in which she moved that more than an
hour should elapse before she heard Bertha walk down the silent passage
and regain her room The morrow rising on an apparent continuance of the
same conditions revealed nothing of what had occurred between the
confronted pair One fact alone outwardly proclaimed the change they were
all conspiring to ignore and that was the nonappearance of Ned
Silverton No one referred to it and this tacit avoidance of the subject
kept it in the immediate foreground of consciousness But there was
another change perceptible only to Lily and that was that Dorset now
avoided her almost as pointedly as his wife Perhaps he was repenting his
rash outpourings of the previous day perhaps only trying in his clumsy
way to conform to Seldens counsel to behave as usual Such
instructions no more make for easiness of attitude than the
photographers behest to look natural and in a creature as unconscious
as poor Dorset of the appearance he habitually presented the struggle to
maintain a pose was sure to result in queer contortions

It resulted at any rate in throwing Lily strangely on her own
resources She had learned on leaving her room that Mrs Dorset was
still invisible and that Dorset had left the yacht early and feeling
too restless to remain alone she too had herself ferried ashore
Straying toward the Casino she attached herself to a group of
acquaintances from Nice with whom she lunched and in whose company she
was returning to the rooms when she encountered Selden crossing the
square She could not at the moment separate herself definitely from
her party who had hospitably assumed that she would remain with them
till they took their departure but she found time for a momentary pause
of enquiry to which he promptly returned Ive seen him againhes
just left me

She waited before him anxiously Well what has happened What WILL
happen

Nothing as yetand nothing in the future I think

Its over then Its settled Youre sure

He smiled Give me time Im not surebut Im a good deal surer And
with that she had to content herself and hasten on to the expectant
group on the steps

Selden had in fact given her the utmost measure of his sureness had even
stretched it a shade to meet the anxiety in her eyes And now as he
turned away strolling down the hill toward the station that anxiety
remained with him as the visible justification of his own It was not
indeed anything specific that he feared there had been a literal truth
in his declaration that he did not think anything would happen What
troubled him was that though Dorsets attitude had perceptibly changed
the change was not clearly to be accounted for It had certainly not been
produced by Seldens arguments or by the action of his own soberer
reason Five minutes talk sufficed to show that some alien influence had
been at work and that it had not so much subdued his resentment as
weakened his will so that he moved under it in a state of apathy like a
dangerous lunatic who has been drugged Temporarily no doubt however
exerted it worked for the general safety the question was how long it
would last and by what kind of reaction it was likely to be followed On
these points Selden could gain no light for he saw that one effect of
the transformation had been to shut him off from free communion with
Dorset The latter indeed was still moved by the irresistible desire to
discuss his wrong but though he revolved about it with the same forlorn
tenacity Selden was aware that something always restrained him from full
expression His state was one to produce first weariness and then
impatience in his hearer and when their talk was over Selden began to
feel that he had done his utmost and might justifiably wash his hands of
the sequel

It was in this mind that he had been making his way back to the station
when Miss Bart crossed his path but though after his brief word with
her he kept mechanically on his course he was conscious of a gradual
change in his purpose The change had been produced by the look in her
eyes and in his eagerness to define the nature of that look he dropped
into a seat in the gardens and sat brooding upon the question It was
natural enough in all conscience that she should appear anxious a
young woman placed in the close intimacy of a yachtingcruise between a
couple on the verge of disaster could hardly aside from her concern for
her friends be insensible to the awkwardness of her own position The
worst of it was that in interpreting Miss Barts state of mind so many
alternative readings were possible and one of these in Seldens
troubled mind took the ugly form suggested by Mrs Fisher If the girl
was afraid was she afraid for herself or for her friends And to what
degree was her dread of a catastrophe intensified by the sense of being
fatally involved in it The burden of offence lying manifestly with Mrs
Dorset this conjecture seemed on the face of it gratuitously unkind but
Selden knew that in the most onesided matrimonial quarrel there are
generally countercharges to be brought and that they are brought with
the greater audacity where the original grievance is so emphatic Mrs
Fisher had not hesitated to suggest the likelihood of Dorsets marrying
Miss Bart if anything happened and though Mrs Fishers conclusions
were notoriously rash she was shrewd enough in reading the signs from
which they were drawn Dorset had apparently shown marked interest in the
girl and this interest might be used to cruel advantage in his wifes
struggle for rehabilitation Selden knew that Bertha would fight to the
last round of powder the rashness of her conduct was illogically
combined with a cold determination to escape its consequences She could
be as unscrupulous in fighting for herself as she was reckless in
courting danger and whatever came to her hand at such moments was likely
to be used as a defensive missile He did not as yet see clearly just
what course she was likely to take but his perplexity increased his
apprehension and with it the sense that before leaving he must speak
again with Miss Bart Whatever her share in the situationand he had
always honestly tried to resist judging her by her surroundingshowever
free she might be from any personal connection with it she would be
better out of the way of a possible crash and since she had appealed to
him for help it was clearly his business to tell her so

This decision at last brought him to his feet and carried him back to
the gambling rooms within whose doors he had seen her disappearing but
a prolonged exploration of the crowd failed to put him on her traces He
saw instead to his surprise Ned Silverton loitering somewhat
ostentatiously about the tables and the discovery that this actor in the
drama was not only hovering in the wings but actually inviting the
exposure of the footlights though it might have seemed to imply that all
peril was over served rather to deepen Seldens sense of foreboding
Charged with this impression he returned to the square hoping to see
Miss Bart move across it as every one in Monte Carlo seemed inevitably
to do at least a dozen times a day but here again he waited vainly for a
glimpse of her and the conclusion was slowly forced on him that she had
gone back to the Sabrina It would be difficult to follow her there and
still more difficult should he do so to contrive the opportunity for a
private word and he had almost decided on the unsatisfactory alternative
of writing when the ceaseless diorama of the square suddenly unrolled
before him the figures of Lord Hubert and Mrs Bry

Hailing them at once with his question he learned from Lord Hubert that
Miss Bart had just returned to the Sabrina in Dorsets company an
announcement so evidently disconcerting to him that Mrs Bry after a
glance from her companion which seemed to act like the pressure on a
spring brought forth the prompt proposal that he should come and meet
his friends at dinner that eveningAt Becassinsa little dinner to
the Duchess she flashed out before Lord Hubert had time to remove the
pressure

Seldens sense of the privilege of being included in such company brought
him early in the evening to the door of the restaurant where he paused
to scan the ranks of diners approaching down the brightly lit terrace
There while the Brys hovered within over the last agitating alternatives
of the MENU he kept watch for the guests from the Sabrina who at length
rose on the horizon in company with the Duchess Lord and Lady Skiddaw
and the Stepneys From this group it was easy for him to detach Miss
Bart on the pretext of a moments glance into one of the brilliant shops
along the terrace and to say to her while they lingered together in the
white dazzle of a jewellers window I stopped over to see youto beg
of you to leave the yacht

The eyes she turned on him showed a quick gleam of her former fear To
leave What do you mean What has happened

Nothing But if anything should why be in the way of it

The glare from the jewellers window deepening the pallour of her face
gave to its delicate lines the sharpness of a tragic mask Nothing
will I am sure but while theres even a doubt left how can you think I
would leave Bertha

The words rang out on a note of contemptwas it possibly of contempt for
himself Well he was willing to risk its renewal to the extent of
insisting with an undeniable throb of added interest You have yourself
to think of you know to which with a strange fall of sadness in her
voice she answered meeting his eyes If you knew how little difference
that makes

Oh well nothing WILL happen he said more for his own reassurance
than for hers and Nothing nothing of course she valiantly assented
as they turned to overtake their companions

In the thronged restaurant taking their places about Mrs Brys
illuminated board their confidence seemed to gain support from the
familiarity of their surroundings Here were Dorset and his wife once
more presenting their customary faces to the world she engrossed in
establishing her relation with an intensely new gown he shrinking with
dyspeptic dread from the multiplied solicitations of the MENU The mere
fact that they thus showed themselves together with the utmost openness
the place afforded seemed to declare beyond a doubt that their
differences were composed How this end had been attained was still
matter for wonder but it was clear that for the moment Miss Bart rested
confidently in the result and Selden tried to achieve the same view by
telling himself that her opportunities for observation had been ampler
than his own

Meanwhile as the dinner advanced through a labyrinth of courses in
which it became clear that Mrs Bry had occasionally broken away from
Lord Huberts restraining hand Seldens general watchfulness began to
lose itself in a particular study of Miss Bart It was one of the days
when she was so handsome that to be handsome was enough and all the
resther grace her quickness her social felicitiesseemed the
overflow of a bounteous nature But what especially struck him was the
way in which she detached herself by a hundred undefinable shades from
the persons who most abounded in her own style It was in just such
company the fine flower and complete expression of the state she aspired
to that the differences came out with special poignancy her grace
cheapening the other womens smartness as her finelydiscriminated
silences made their chatter dull The strain of the last hours had
restored to her face the deeper eloquence which Selden had lately missed
in it and the bravery of her words to him still fluttered in her voice
and eyes Yes she was matchlessit was the one word for her and he
could give his admiration the freer play because so little personal
feeling remained in it His real detachment from her had taken place not
at the lurid moment of disenchantment but now in the sober afterlight
of discrimination where he saw her definitely divided from him by the
crudeness of a choice which seemed to deny the very differences he felt
in her It was before him again in its completenessthe choice in which
she was content to rest in the stupid costliness of the food and the
showy dulness of the talk in the freedom of speech which never arrived
at wit and the freedom of act which never made for romance The strident
setting of the restaurant in which their table seemed set apart in a
special glare of publicity and the presence at it of little Dabham of
the Riviera Notes emphasized the ideals of a world where
conspicuousness passed for distinction and the society column had become
the roll of fame

It was as the immortalizer of such occasions that little Dabham wedged
in modest watchfulness between two brilliant neighbours suddenly became
the centre of Seldens scrutiny How much did he know of what was going
on and how much for his purpose was still worth finding out His
little eyes were like tentacles thrown out to catch the floating
intimations with which to Selden the air at moments seemed thick then
again it cleared to its normal emptiness and he could see nothing in it
for the journalist but leisure to note the elegance of the ladies gowns
Mrs Dorsets in particular challenged all the wealth of Mr Dabhams
vocabulary it had surprises and subtleties worthy of what he would have
called the literary style At first as Selden had noticed it had been
almost too preoccupying to its wearer but now she was in full command of
it and was even producing her effects with unwonted freedom Was she
not indeed too free too fluent for perfect naturalness And was not
Dorset to whom his glance had passed by a natural transition too
jerkily wavering between the same extremes Dorset indeed was always
jerky but it seemed to Selden that tonight each vibration swung him
farther from his centre

The dinner meanwhile was moving to its triumphant close to the evident
satisfaction of Mrs Bry who throned in apoplectic majesty between Lord
Skiddaw and Lord Hubert seemed in spirit to be calling on Mrs Fisher to
witness her achievement Short of Mrs Fisher her audience might have
been called complete for the restaurant was crowded with persons mainly
gathered there for the purpose of spectatorship and accurately posted as
to the names and faces of the celebrities they had come to see Mrs Bry
conscious that all her feminine guests came under that heading and that
each one looked her part to admiration shone on Lily with all the
pentup gratitude that Mrs Fisher had failed to deserve Selden
catching the glance wondered what part Miss Bart had played in
organizing the entertainment She did at least a great deal to adorn
it and as he watched the bright security with which she bore herself he
smiled to think that he should have fancied her in need of help Never
had she appeared more serenely mistress of the situation than when at
the moment of dispersal detaching herself a little from the group about
the table she turned with a smile and a graceful slant of the shoulders
to receive her cloak from Dorset

The dinner had been protracted over Mr Brys exceptional cigars and a
bewildering array of liqueurs and many of the other tables were empty
but a sufficient number of diners still lingered to give relief to the
leavetaking of Mrs Brys distinguished guests This ceremony was drawn
out and complicated by the fact that it involved on the part of the
Duchess and Lady Skiddaw definite farewells and pledges of speedy
reunion in Paris where they were to pause and replenish their wardrobes
on the way to England The quality of Mrs Brys hospitality and of the
tips her husband had presumably imparted lent to the manner of the
English ladies a general effusiveness which shed the rosiest light over
their hostesss future In its glow Mrs Dorset and the Stepneys were
also visibly included and the whole scene had touches of intimacy worth
their weight in gold to the watchful pen of Mr Dabham

A glance at her watch caused the Duchess to exclaim to her sister that
they had just time to dash for their train and the flurry of this
departure over the Stepneys who had their motor at the door offered to
convey the Dorsets and Miss Bart to the quay The offer was accepted
and Mrs Dorset moved away with her husband in attendance Miss Bart had
lingered for a last word with Lord Hubert and Stepney on whom Mr Bry
was pressing a final and still more expensive cigar called out Come
on Lily if youre going back to the yacht

Lily turned to obey but as she did so Mrs Dorset who had paused on
her way out moved a few steps back toward the table

Miss Bart is not going back to the yacht she said in a voice of
singular distinctness

A startled look ran from eye to eye Mrs Bry crimsoned to the verge of
congestion Mrs Stepney slipped nervously behind her husband and
Selden in the general turmoil of his sensations was mainly conscious of
a longing to grip Dabham by the collar and fling him out into the street

Dorset meanwhile had stepped back to his wifes side His face was
white and he looked about him with cowed angry eyes BerthaMiss
Bart    this is some misunderstanding    some mistake   

Miss Bart remains here his wife rejoined incisively And I think
George we had better not detain Mrs Stepney any longer

Miss Bart during this brief exchange of words remained in admirable
erectness slightly isolated from the embarrassed group about her She
had paled a little under the shock of the insult but the discomposure of
the surrounding faces was not reflected in her own The faint disdain of
her smile seemed to lift her high above her antagonists reach and it
was not till she had given Mrs Dorset the full measure of the distance
between them that she turned and extended her hand to her hostess

I am joining the Duchess tomorrow she explained and it seemed easier
for me to remain on shore for the night

She held firmly to Mrs Brys wavering eye while she gave this
explanation but when it was over Selden saw her send a tentative glance
from one to another of the womens faces She read their incredulity in
their averted looks and in the mute wretchedness of the men behind them
and for a miserable halfsecond he thought she quivered on the brink of
failure Then turning to him with an easy gesture and the pale bravery
of her recovered smileDear Mr Selden she said you promised to see
me to my cab



Outside the sky was gusty and overcast and as Lily and Selden moved
toward the deserted gardens below the restaurant spurts of warm rain
blew fitfully against their faces The fiction of the cab had been
tacitly abandoned they walked on in silence her hand on his arm till
the deeper shade of the gardens received them and pausing beside a
bench he said Sit down a moment

She dropped to the seat without answering but the electric lamp at the
bend of the path shed a gleam on the struggling misery of her face
Selden sat down beside her waiting for her to speak fearful lest any
word he chose should touch too roughly on her wound and kept also from
free utterance by the wretched doubt which had slowly renewed itself
within him What had brought her to this pass What weakness had placed
her so abominably at her enemys mercy And why should Bertha Dorset have
turned into an enemy at the very moment when she so obviously needed the
support of her sex Even while his nerves raged at the subjection of
husbands to their wives and at the cruelty of women to their kind
reason obstinately harped on the proverbial relation between smoke and
fire The memory of Mrs Fishers hints and the corroboration of his own
impressions while they deepened his pity also increased his constraint
since whichever way he sought a free outlet for sympathy it was blocked
by the fear of committing a blunder

Suddenly it struck him that his silence must seem almost as accusatory as
that of the men he had despised for turning from her but before he could
find the fitting word she had cut him short with a question

Do you know of a quiet hotel I can send for my maid in the morning

An hotelHEREthat you can go to alone Its not possible

She met this with a pale gleam of her old playfulness What IS then
Its too wet to sleep in the gardens

But there must be some one

Some one to whom I can go Of courseany numberbut at THIS hour You
see my change of plan was rather sudden

Good Godif youd listened to me he cried venting his helplessness
in a burst of anger

She still held him off with the gentle mockery of her smile But havent
I she rejoined You advised me to leave the yacht and Im leaving it

He saw then with a pang of selfreproach that she meant neither to
explain nor to defend herself that by his miserable silence he had
forfeited all chance of helping her and that the decisive hour was past

She had risen and stood before him in a kind of clouded majesty like
some deposed princess moving tranquilly to exile

Lily he exclaimed with a note of despairing appeal butOh not
now she gently admonished him and then in all the sweetness of her
recovered composure Since I must find shelter somewhere and since
youre so kindly here to help me

He gathered himself up at the challenge You will do as I tell you
Theres but one thing then you must go straight to your cousins the
Stepneys

Oh broke from her with a movement of instinctive resistance but he
insisted Comeits late and you must appear to have gone there
directly

He had drawn her hand into his arm but she held him back with a last
gesture of protest I cantI cantnot thatyou dont know Gwen you
mustnt ask me

I MUST ask youyou must obey me he persisted though infected at
heart by her own fear

Her voice sank to a whisper And if she refusesbut Oh trust
metrust me he could only insist in return and yielding to his touch
she let him lead her back in silence to the edge of the square

In the cab they continued to remain silent through the brief drive which
carried them to the illuminated portals of the Stepneys hotel Here he
left her outside in the darkness of the raised hood while his name was
sent up to Stepney and he paced the showy hall awaiting the latters
descent Ten minutes later the two men passed out together between the
goldlaced custodians of the threshold but in the vestibule Stepney drew
up with a last flare of reluctance

Its understood then he stipulated nervously with his hand on
Seldens arm She leaves tomorrow by the early trainand my wifes
asleep and cant be disturbed



Chapter 4

The blinds of Mrs Penistons drawingroom were drawn down against the
oppressive June sun and in the sultry twilight the faces of her
assembled relatives took on a fitting shadow of bereavement They were
all there Van Alstynes Stepneys and Melsonseven a stray Peniston or
two indicating by a greater latitude in dress and manner the fact of
remoter relationship and more settled hopes The Peniston side was in
fact secure in the knowledge that the bulk of Mr Penistons property
went back while the direct connection hung suspended on the disposal
of his widows private fortune and on the uncertainty of its extent
Jack Stepney in his new character as the richest nephew tacitly took
the lead emphasizing his importance by the deeper gloss of his mourning
and the subdued authority of his manner while his wifes bored attitude
and frivolous gown proclaimed the heiresss disregard of the
insignificant interests at stake Old Ned Van Alstyne seated next to her
in a coat that made affliction dapper twirled his white moustache to
conceal the eager twitch of his lips and Grace Stepney rednosed and
smelling of crape whispered emotionally to Mrs Herbert Melson I
couldnt BEAR to see the Niagara anywhere else

A rustle of weeds and quick turning of heads hailed the opening of the
door and Lily Bart appeared tall and noble in her black dress with
Gerty Farish at her side The womens faces as she paused
interrogatively on the threshold were a study in hesitation One or two
made faint motions of recognition which might have been subdued either
by the solemnity of the scene or by the doubt as to how far the others
meant to go Mrs Jack Stepney gave a careless nod and Grace Stepney
with a sepulchral gesture indicated a seat at her side But Lily
ignoring the invitation as well as Jack Stepneys official attempt to
direct her moved across the room with her smooth free gait and seated
herself in a chair which seemed to have been purposely placed apart from
the others

It was the first time that she had faced her family since her return from
Europe two weeks earlier but if she perceived any uncertainty in their
welcome it served only to add a tinge of irony to the usual composure of
her bearing The shock of dismay with which on the dock she had heard
from Gerty Farish of Mrs Penistons sudden death had been mitigated
almost at once by the irrepressible thought that now at last she would
be able to pay her debts She had looked forward with considerable
uneasiness to her first encounter with her aunt Mrs Peniston had
vehemently opposed her nieces departure with the Dorsets and had marked
her continued disapproval by not writing during Lilys absence The
certainty that she had heard of the rupture with the Dorsets made the
prospect of the meeting more formidable and how should Lily have
repressed a quick sense of relief at the thought that instead of
undergoing the anticipated ordeal she had only to enter gracefully on a
longassured inheritance It had been in the consecrated phrase always
understood that Mrs Peniston was to provide handsomely for her niece
and in the latters mind the understanding had long since crystallized
into fact

She gets everything of courseI dont see what were here for Mrs
Jack Stepney remarked with careless loudness to Ned Van Alstyne and the
latters deprecating murmurJulia was always a just womanmight have
been interpreted as signifying either acquiescence or doubt

Well its only about four hundred thousand Mrs Stepney rejoined with
a yawn and Grace Stepney in the silence produced by the lawyers
preliminary cough was heard to sob out They wont find a towel
missingI went over them with her the very day

Lily oppressed by the close atmosphere and the stifling odour of fresh
mourning felt her attention straying as Mrs Penistons lawyer solemnly
erect behind the Buhl table at the end of the room began to rattle
through the preamble of the will

Its like being in church she reflected wondering vaguely where Gwen
Stepney had got such an awful hat Then she noticed how stout Jack had
grownhe would soon be almost as plethoric as Herbert Melson who sat a
few feet off breathing puffily as he leaned his blackgloved hands on
his stick

I wonder why rich people always grow fatI suppose its because theres
nothing to worry them If I inherit I shall have to be careful of my
figure she mused while the lawyer droned on through a labyrinth of
legacies The servants came first then a few charitable institutions
then several remoter Melsons and Stepneys who stirred consciously as
their names rang out and then subsided into a state of impassiveness
befitting the solemnity of the occasion Ned Van Alstyne Jack Stepney
and a cousin or two followed each coupled with the mention of a few
thousands Lily wondered that Grace Stepney was not among them Then she
heard her own nameto my niece Lily Bart ten thousand dollars and
after that the lawyer again lost himself in a coil of unintelligible
periods from which the concluding phrase flashed out with startling
distinctness and the residue of my estate to my dear cousin and
namesake Grace Julia Stepney

There was a subdued gasp of surprise a rapid turning of heads and a
surging of sable figures toward the corner in which Miss Stepney wailed
out her sense of unworthiness through the crumpled ball of a blackedged
handkerchief

Lily stood apart from the general movement feeling herself for the first
time utterly alone No one looked at her no one seemed aware of her
presence she was probing the very depths of insignificance And under
her sense of the collective indifference came the acuter pang of hopes
deceived Disinheritedshe had been disinheritedand for Grace
Stepney She met Gertys lamentable eyes fixed on her in a despairing
effort at consolation and the look brought her to herself There was
something to be done before she left the house to be done with all the
nobility she knew how to put into such gestures She advanced to the
group about Miss Stepney and holding out her hand said simply Dear
Grace I am so glad

The other ladies had fallen back at her approach and a space created
itself about her It widened as she turned to go and no one advanced to
fill it up She paused a moment glancing about her calmly taking the
measure of her situation She heard some one ask a question about the
date of the will she caught a fragment of the lawyers answersomething
about a sudden summons and an earlier instrument Then the tide of
dispersal began to drift past her Mrs Jack Stepney and Mrs Herbert
Melson stood on the doorstep awaiting their motor a sympathizing group
escorted Grace Stepney to the cab it was felt to be fitting she should
take though she lived but a street or two away and Miss Bart and Gerty
found themselves almost alone in the purple drawingroom which more than
ever in its stuffy dimness resembled a wellkept family vault in which
the last corpse had just been decently deposited



In Gerty Farishs sittingroom whither a hansom had carried the two
friends Lily dropped into a chair with a faint sound of laughter it
struck her as a humorous coincidence that her aunts legacy should so
nearly represent the amount of her debt to Trenor The need of
discharging that debt had reasserted itself with increased urgency since
her return to America and she spoke her first thought in saying to the
anxiously hovering Gerty I wonder when the legacies will be paid

But Miss Farish could not pause over the legacies she broke into a
larger indignation Oh Lily its unjust its cruelGrace Stepney
must FEEL she has no right to all that money

Any one who knew how to please Aunt Julia has a right to her money
Miss Bart rejoined philosophically

But she was devoted to youshe led every one to think Gerty checked
herself in evident embarrassment and Miss Bart turned to her with a
direct look Gerty be honest this will was made only six weeks ago
She had heard of my break with the Dorsets

Every one heard of course that there had been some disagreementsome
misunderstanding

Did she hear that Bertha turned me off the yacht

Lily

That was what happened you know She said I was trying to marry George
Dorset She did it to make him think she was jealous Isnt that what
she told Gwen Stepney

I dont knowI dont listen to such horrors

I MUST listen to themI must know where I stand She paused and again
sounded a faint note of derision Did you notice the women They were
afraid to snub me while they thought I was going to get the
moneyafterward they scuttled off as if I had the plague Gerty
remained silent and she continued I stayed on to see what would
happen They took their cue from Gwen Stepney and Lulu MelsonI saw them
watching to see what Gwen would doGerty I must know just what is
being said of me

I tell you I dont listen

One hears such things without listening She rose and laid her resolute
hands on Miss Farishs shoulders Gerty are people going to cut me

Your FRIENDS Lilyhow can you think it

Who are ones friends at such a time Who but you you poor trustful
darling And heaven knows what YOU suspect me of She kissed Gerty with
a whimsical murmur Youd never let it make any differencebut then
youre fond of criminals Gerty How about the irreclaimable ones
though For Im absolutely impenitent you know

She drew herself up to the full height of her slender majesty towering
like some dark angel of defiance above the troubled Gerty who could only
falter out Lily Lilyhow can you laugh about such things

So as not to weep perhaps But noIm not of the tearful order I
discovered early that crying makes my nose red and the knowledge has
helped me through several painful episodes She took a restless turn
about the room and then reseating herself lifted the bright mockery of
her eyes to Gertys anxious countenance

I shouldnt have minded you know if Id got the money and at Miss
Farishs protesting Oh she repeated calmly Not a straw my dear
for in the first place they wouldnt have quite dared to ignore me and
if they had it wouldnt have mattered because I should have been
independent of them But now The irony faded from her eyes and she
bent a clouded face upon her friend

How can you talk so Lily Of course the money ought to have been yours
but after all that makes no difference The important thing Gerty
paused and then continued firmly The important thing is that you
should clear yourselfshould tell your friends the whole truth

The whole truth Miss Bart laughed What is truth Where a woman is
concerned its the story thats easiest to believe In this case its a
great deal easier to believe Bertha Dorsets story than mine because she
has a big house and an opera box and its convenient to be on good terms
with her

Miss Farish still fixed her with an anxious gaze But what IS your
story Lily I dont believe any one knows it yet

My storyI dont believe I know it myself You see I never thought of
preparing a version in advance as Bertha didand if I had I dont think
I should take the trouble to use it now

But Gerty continued with her quiet reasonableness I dont want a
version prepared in advancebut I want you to tell me exactly what
happened from the beginning

From the beginning Miss Bart gently mimicked her Dear Gerty how
little imagination you good people have Why the beginning was in my
cradle I supposein the way I was brought up and the things I was
taught to care for Or noI wont blame anybody for my faults Ill say
it was in my blood that I got it from some wicked pleasureloving
ancestress who reacted against the homely virtues of New Amsterdam and
wanted to be back at the court of the Charleses And as Miss Farish
continued to press her with troubled eyes she went on impatiently You
asked me just now for the truthwell the truth about any girl is that
once shes talked about shes done for and the more she explains her
case the worse it looksMy good Gerty you dont happen to have a
cigarette about you



In her stuffy room at the hotel to which she had gone on landing Lily
Bart that evening reviewed her situation It was the last week in June
and none of her friends were in town The few relatives who had stayed
on or returned for the reading of Mrs Penistons will had taken
flight again that afternoon to Newport or Long Island and not one of
them had made any proffer of hospitality to Lily For the first time in
her life she found herself utterly alone except for Gerty Farish Even at
the actual moment of her break with the Dorsets she had not had so keen a
sense of its consequences for the Duchess of Beltshire hearing of the
catastrophe from Lord Hubert had instantly offered her protection and
under her sheltering wing Lily had made an almost triumphant progress to
London There she had been sorely tempted to linger on in a society which
asked of her only to amuse and charm it without enquiring too curiously
how she had acquired her gift for doing so but Selden before they
parted had pressed on her the urgent need of returning at once to her
aunt and Lord Hubert when he presently reappeared in London abounded
in the same counsel Lily did not need to be told that the Duchesss
championship was not the best road to social rehabilitation and as she
was besides aware that her noble defender might at any moment drop her in
favour of a new PROTEGEE she reluctantly decided to return to America
But she had not been ten minutes on her native shore before she realized
that she had delayed too long to regain it The Dorsets the Stepneys
the Brysall the actors and witnesses in the miserable dramahad
preceded her with their version of the case and even had she seen the
least chance of gaining a hearing for her own some obscure disdain and
reluctance would have restrained her She knew it was not by
explanations and countercharges that she could ever hope to recover her
lost standing but even had she felt the least trust in their efficacy
she would still have been held back by the feeling which had kept her
from defending herself to Gerty Farisha feeling that was half pride and
half humiliation For though she knew she had been ruthlessly sacrificed
to Bertha Dorsets determination to win back her husband and though her
own relation to Dorset had been that of the merest goodfellowship yet
she had been perfectly aware from the outset that her part in the affair
was as Carry Fisher brutally put it to distract Dorsets attention from
his wife That was what she was there for it was the price she had
chosen to pay for three months of luxury and freedom from care Her
habit of resolutely facing the facts in her rare moments of
introspection did not now allow her to put any false gloss on the
situation She had suffered for the very faithfulness with which she had
carried out her part of the tacit compact but the part was not a
handsome one at best and she saw it now in all the ugliness of failure

She saw too in the same uncompromising light the train of consequences
resulting from that failure and these became clearer to her with every
day of her weary lingering in town She stayed on partly for the comfort
of Gerty Farishs nearness and partly for lack of knowing where to go
She understood well enough the nature of the task before her She must
set out to regain little by little the position she had lost and the
first step in the tedious task was to find out as soon as possible on
how many of her friends she could count Her hopes were mainly centred on
Mrs Trenor who had treasures of easygoing tolerance for those who were
amusing or useful to her and in the noisy rush of whose existence the
still small voice of detraction was slow to make itself heard But Judy
though she must have been apprised of Miss Barts return had not even
recognized it by the formal note of condolence which her friends
bereavement demanded Any advance on Lilys side might have been
perilous there was nothing to do but to trust to the happy chance of an
accidental meeting and Lily knew that even so late in the season there
was always a hope of running across her friends in their frequent
passages through town

To this end she assiduously showed herself at the restaurants they
frequented where attended by the troubled Gerty she lunched
luxuriously as she said on her expectations

My dear Gerty you wouldnt have me let the headwaiter see that Ive
nothing to live on but Aunt Julias legacy Think of Grace Stepneys
satisfaction if she came in and found us lunching on cold mutton and tea
What sweet shall we have today dearCOUPE JACQUES or PECHES A LA MELBA

She dropped the MENU abruptly with a quick heightening of colour and
Gerty following her glance was aware of the advance from an inner
room of a party headed by Mrs Trenor and Carry Fisher It was
impossible for these ladies and their companionsamong whom Lily had at
once distinguished both Trenor and Rosedalenot to pass in going out
the table at which the two girls were seated and Gertys sense of the
fact betrayed itself in the helpless trepidation of her manner Miss
Bart on the contrary borne forward on the wave of her buoyant grace
and neither shrinking from her friends nor appearing to lie in wait for
them gave to the encounter the touch of naturalness which she could
impart to the most strained situations Such embarrassment as was shown
was on Mrs Trenors side and manifested itself in the mingling of
exaggerated warmth with imperceptible reservations Her loudly affirmed
pleasure at seeing Miss Bart took the form of a nebulous generalization
which included neither enquiries as to her future nor the expression of a
definite wish to see her again Lily wellversed in the language of
these omissions knew that they were equally intelligible to the other
members of the party even Rosedale flushed as he was with the
importance of keeping such company at once took the temperature of Mrs
Trenors cordiality and reflected it in his offhand greeting of Miss
Bart Trenor red and uncomfortable had cut short his salutations on the
pretext of a word to say to the headwaiter and the rest of the group
soon melted away in Mrs Trenors wake

It was over in a momentthe waiter MENU in hand still hung on the
result of the choice between COUPE JACQUES and PECHES A LA MELBAbut
Miss Bart in the interval had taken the measure of her fate Where Judy
Trenor led all the world would follow and Lily had the doomed sense of
the castaway who has signalled in vain to fleeing sails

In a flash she remembered Mrs Trenors complaints of Carry Fishers
rapacity and saw that they denoted an unexpected acquaintance with her
husbands private affairs In the large tumultuous disorder of the life
at Bellomont where no one seemed to have time to observe any one else
and private aims and personal interests were swept along unheeded in the
rush of collective activities Lily had fancied herself sheltered from
inconvenient scrutiny but if Judy knew when Mrs Fisher borrowed money
of her husband was she likely to ignore the same transaction on Lilys
part If she was careless of his affections she was plainly jealous of
his pocket and in that fact Lily read the explanation of her rebuff The
immediate result of these conclusions was the passionate resolve to pay
back her debt to Trenor That obligation discharged she would have but a
thousand dollars of Mrs Penistons legacy left and nothing to live on
but her own small income which was considerably less than Gerty Farishs
wretched pittance but this consideration gave way to the imperative
claim of her wounded pride She must be quits with the Trenors first
after that she would take thought for the future

In her ignorance of legal procrastinations she had supposed that her
legacy would be paid over within a few days of the reading of her aunts
will and after an interval of anxious suspense she wrote to enquire the
cause of the delay There was another interval before Mrs Penistons
lawyer who was also one of the executors replied to the effect that
some questions having arisen relative to the interpretation of the will
he and his associates might not be in a position to pay the legacies till
the close of the twelvemonth legally allotted for their settlement
Bewildered and indignant Lily resolved to try the effect of a personal
appeal but she returned from her expedition with a sense of the
powerlessness of beauty and charm against the unfeeling processes of the
law It seemed intolerable to live on for another year under the weight
of her debt and in her extremity she decided to turn to Miss Stepney
who still lingered in town immersed in the delectable duty of going
over her benefactresss effects It was bitter enough for Lily to ask a
favour of Grace Stepney but the alternative was bitterer still and one
morning she presented herself at Mrs Penistons where Grace for the
facilitation of her pious task had taken up a provisional abode

The strangeness of entering as a suppliant the house where she had so
long commanded increased Lilys desire to shorten the ordeal and when
Miss Stepney entered the darkened drawingroom rustling with the best
quality of crape her visitor went straight to the point would she be
willing to advance the amount of the expected legacy

Grace in reply wept and wondered at the request bemoaned the
inexorableness of the law and was astonished that Lily had not realized
the exact similarity of their positions Did she think that only the
payment of the legacies had been delayed Why Miss Stepney herself had
not received a penny of her inheritance and was paying rentyes
actuallyfor the privilege of living in a house that belonged to her
She was sure it was not what poor dear cousin Julia would have
wishedshe had told the executors so to their faces but they were
inaccessible to reason and there was nothing to do but to wait Let Lily
take example by her and be patientlet them both remember how
beautifully patient cousin Julia had always been

Lily made a movement which showed her imperfect assimilation of this
example But you will have everything Graceit would be easy for you
to borrow ten times the amount I am asking for

Borroweasy for me to borrow Grace Stepney rose up before her in
sable wrath Do you imagine for a moment that I would raise money on my
expectations from cousin Julia when I know so well her unspeakable
horror of every transaction of the sort Why Lily if you must know the
truth it was the idea of your being in debt that brought on her
illnessyou remember she had a slight attack before you sailed Oh I
dont know the particulars of courseI dont WANT to know thembut
there were rumours about your affairs that made her most unhappyno one
could be with her without seeing that I cant help it if you are
offended by my telling you this nowif I can do anything to make you
realize the folly of your course and how deeply SHE disapproved of it I
shall feel it is the truest way of making up to you for her loss



Chapter 5

It seemed to Lily as Mrs Penistons door closed on her that she was
taking a final leave of her old life The future stretched before her
dull and bare as the deserted length of Fifth Avenue and opportunities
showed as meagrely as the few cabs trailing in quest of fares that did
not come The completeness of the analogy was however disturbed as she
reached the sidewalk by the rapid approach of a hansom which pulled up at
sight of her

From beneath its luggageladen top she caught the wave of a signalling
hand and the next moment Mrs Fisher springing to the street had
folded her in a demonstrative embrace

My dear you dont mean to say youre still in town When I saw you the
other day at Sherrys I didnt have time to ask She broke off and
added with a burst of frankness The truth is I was HORRID Lily and
Ive wanted to tell you so ever since

Oh Miss Bart protested drawing back from her penitent clasp but
Mrs Fisher went on with her usual directness Look here Lily dont
lets beat about the bush half the trouble in life is caused by
pretending there isnt any Thats not my way and I can only say Im
thoroughly ashamed of myself for following the other womens lead But
well talk of that by and byetell me now where youre staying and what
your plans are I dont suppose youre keeping house in there with Grace
Stepney ehand it struck me you might be rather at loose ends

In Lilys present mood there was no resisting the honest friendliness of
this appeal and she said with a smile I am at loose ends for the
moment but Gerty Farish is still in town and shes good enough to let
me be with her whenever she can spare the time

Mrs Fisher made a slight grimace Hmthats a temperate joy Oh I
knowGertys a trump and worth all the rest of us put together but A
LA LONGUE youre used to a little higher seasoning arent you dear
And besides I suppose shell be off herself before longthe first of
August you say Well look here you cant spend your summer in town
well talk of that later too But meanwhile what do you say to putting a
few things in a trunk and coming down with me to the Sam Gormers
tonight

And as Lily stared at the breathless suddenness of the suggestion she
continued with her easy laugh You dont know them and they dont know
you but that dont make a rap of difference Theyve taken the Van
Alstyne place at Roslyn and Ive got CARTE BLANCHE to bring my friends
down therethe more the merrier They do things awfully well and
theres to be rather a jolly party there this week she broke off
checked by an undefinable change in Miss Barts expression Oh I dont
mean YOUR particular set you know rather a different crowd but very
good fun The fact is the Gormers have struck out on a line of their
own what they want is to have a good time and to have it in their own
way They gave the other thing a few months trial under my
distinguished auspices and they were really doing extremely
wellgetting on a good deal faster than the Brys just because they
didnt care as muchbut suddenly they decided that the whole business
bored them and that what they wanted was a crowd they could really feel
at home with Rather original of them dont you think so Mattie Gormer
HAS got aspirations still women always have but shes awfully
easygoing and Sam wont be bothered and they both like to be the most
important people in sight so theyve started a sort of continuous
performance of their own a kind of social Coney Island where everybody
is welcome who can make noise enough and doesnt put on airs I think
its awfully good fun myselfsome of the artistic set you know any
pretty actress thats going and so on This week for instance they
have Audrey Anstell who made such a hit last spring in The Winning of
Winny and Paul Morpethhes painting Mattie Gormerand the Dick
Bellingers and Kate Corbywell every one you can think of whos jolly
and makes a row Now dont stand there with your nose in the air my
dearit will be a good deal better than a broiling Sunday in town and
youll find clever people as well as noisy onesMorpeth who admires
Mattie enormously always brings one or two of his set

Mrs Fisher drew Lily toward the hansom with friendly authority Jump
in now theres a dear and well drive round to your hotel and have your
things packed and then well have tea and the two maids can meet us at
the train



It was a good deal better than a broiling Sunday in townof that no
doubt remained to Lily as reclining in the shade of a leafy verandah
she looked seaward across a stretch of greensward picturesquely dotted
with groups of ladies in lace raiment and men in tennis flannels The
huge Van Alstyne house and its rambling dependencies were packed to their
fullest capacity with the Gormers weekend guests who now in the
radiance of the Sunday forenoon were dispersing themselves over the
grounds in quest of the various distractions the place afforded
distractions ranging from tenniscourts to shootinggalleries from
bridge and whiskey within doors to motors and steamlaunches without
Lily had the odd sense of having been caught up into the crowd as
carelessly as a passenger is gathered in by an express train The blonde
and genial Mrs Gormer might indeed have figured the conductor calmly
assigning seats to the rush of travellers while Carry Fisher represented
the porter pushing their bags into place giving them their numbers for
the diningcar and warning them when their station was at hand The
train meanwhile had scarcely slackened speedlife whizzed on with a
deafening rattle and roar in which one traveller at least found a
welcome refuge from the sound of her own thoughts The Gormer MILIEU
represented a social outskirt which Lily had always fastidiously
avoided but it struck her now that she was in it as only a flamboyant
copy of her own world a caricature approximating the real thing as the
society play approaches the manners of the drawingroom The people
about her were doing the same things as the Trenors the Van Osburghs and
the Dorsets the difference lay in a hundred shades of aspect and manner
from the pattern of the mens waistcoats to the inflexion of the womens
voices Everything was pitched in a higher key and there was more of
each thing more noise more colour more champagne more
familiaritybut also greater goodnature less rivalry and a fresher
capacity for enjoyment

Miss Barts arrival had been welcomed with an uncritical friendliness
that first irritated her pride and then brought her to a sharp sense of
her own situationof the place in life which for the moment she must
accept and make the best of These people knew her storyof that her
first long talk with Carry Fisher had left no doubt she was publicly
branded as the heroine of a queer episodebut instead of shrinking
from her as her own friends had done they received her without question
into the easy promiscuity of their lives They swallowed her past as
easily as they did Miss Anstells and with no apparent sense of any
difference in the size of the mouthful all they asked was that she
shouldin her own way for they recognized a diversity of
giftscontribute as much to the general amusement as that graceful
actress whose talents when off the stage were of the most varied
order Lily felt at once that any tendency to be stuckup to mark a
sense of differences and distinctions would be fatal to her continuance
in the Gormer set To be taken in on such termsand into such a
worldwas hard enough to the lingering pride in her but she realized
with a pang of selfcontempt that to be excluded from it would after
all be harder still For almost at once she had felt the insidious
charm of slipping back into a life where every material difficulty was
smoothed away The sudden escape from a stifling hotel in a dusty
deserted city to the space and luxury of a great countryhouse fanned by
sea breezes had produced a state of moral lassitude agreeable enough
after the nervous tension and physical discomfort of the past weeks For
the moment she must yield to the refreshment her senses cravedafter
that she would reconsider her situation and take counsel with her
dignity Her enjoyment of her surroundings was indeed tinged by the
unpleasant consideration that she was accepting the hospitality and
courting the approval of people she had disdained under other conditions
But she was growing less sensitive on such points a hard glaze of
indifference was fast forming over her delicacies and susceptibilities
and each concession to expediency hardened the surface a little more

On the Monday when the party disbanded with uproarious adieux the
return to town threw into stronger relief the charms of the life she was
leaving The other guests were dispersing to take up the same existence
in a different setting some at Newport some at Bar Harbour some in the
elaborate rusticity of an Adirondack camp Even Gerty Farish who
welcomed Lilys return with tender solicitude would soon be preparing to
join the aunt with whom she spent her summers on Lake George only Lily
herself remained without plan or purpose stranded in a backwater of the
great current of pleasure But Carry Fisher who had insisted on
transporting her to her own house where she herself was to perch for a
day or two on the way to the Brys camp came to the rescue with a new
suggestion

Look here LilyIll tell you what it is I want you to take my place
with Mattie Gormer this summer Theyre taking a party out to Alaska next
month in their private car and Mattie who is the laziest woman alive
wants me to go with them and relieve her of the bother of arranging
things but the Brys want me toooh yes weve made it up didnt I
tell youand to put it frankly though I like the Gormers best
theres more profit for me in the Brys The fact is they want to try
Newport this summer and if I can make it a success for them theywell
theyll make it a success for me Mrs Fisher clasped her hands
enthusiastically Do you know Lily the more I think of my idea the
better I like itquite as much for you as for myself The Gormers have
both taken a tremendous fancy to you and the trip to Alaska
iswellthe very thing I should want for you just at present

Miss Bart lifted her eyes with a keen glance To take me out of my
friends way you mean she said quietly and Mrs Fisher responded with
a deprecating kiss To keep you out of their sight till they realize how
much they miss you



Miss Bart went with the Gormers to Alaska and the expedition if it did
not produce the effect anticipated by her friend had at least the
negative advantage of removing her from the fiery centre of criticism and
discussion Gerty Farish had opposed the plan with all the energy of her
somewhat inarticulate nature She had even offered to give up her visit
to Lake George and remain in town with Miss Bart if the latter would
renounce her journey but Lily could disguise her real distaste for this
plan under a sufficiently valid reason

You dear innocent dont you see she protested that Carry is quite
right and that I must take up my usual life and go about among people
as much as possible If my old friends choose to believe lies about me I
shall have to make new ones thats all and you know beggars mustnt be
choosers Not that I dont like Mattie GormerI DO like her shes kind
and honest and unaffected and dont you suppose I feel grateful to her
for making me welcome at a time when as youve yourself seen my own
family have unanimously washed their hands of me

Gerty shook her head mutely unconvinced She felt not only that Lily was
cheapening herself by making use of an intimacy she would never have
cultivated from choice but that in drifting back now to her former
manner of life she was forfeiting her last chance of ever escaping from
it Gerty had but an obscure conception of what Lilys actual experience
had been but its consequences had established a lasting hold on her pity
since the memorable night when she had offered up her own secret hope to
her friends extremity To characters like Gertys such a sacrifice
constitutes a moral claim on the part of the person in whose behalf it
has been made Having once helped Lily she must continue to help her
and helping her must believe in her because faith is the mainspring of
such natures But even if Miss Bart after her renewed taste of the
amenities of life could have returned to the barrenness of a New York
August mitigated only by poor Gertys presence her worldly wisdom would
have counselled her against such an act of abnegation She knew that
Carry Fisher was right that an opportune absence might be the first step
toward rehabilitation and that at any rate to linger on in town out of
season was a fatal admission of defeat From the Gormers tumultuous
progress across their native continent she returned with an altered view
of her situation The renewed habit of luxurythe daily waking to an
assured absence of care and presence of material easegradually blunted
her appreciation of these values and left her more conscious of the void
they could not fill Mattie Gormers undiscriminating goodnature and
the slapdash sociability of her friends who treated Lily precisely as
they treated each otherall these characteristic notes of difference
began to wear upon her endurance and the more she saw to criticize in
her companions the less justification she found for making use of them
The longing to get back to her former surroundings hardened to a fixed
idea but with the strengthening of her purpose came the inevitable
perception that to attain it she must exact fresh concessions from her
pride These for the moment took the unpleasant form of continuing to
cling to her hosts after their return from Alaska Little as she was in
the key of their MILIEU her immense social facility her long habit of
adapting herself to others without suffering her own outline to be
blurred the skilled manipulation of all the polished implements of her
craft had won for her an important place in the Gormer group If their
resonant hilarity could never be hers she contributed a note of easy
elegance more valuable to Mattie Gormer than the louder passages of the
band Sam Gormer and his special cronies stood indeed a little in awe of
her but Matties following headed by Paul Morpeth made her feel that
they prized her for the very qualities they most conspicuously lacked If
Morpeth whose social indolence was as great as his artistic activity
had abandoned himself to the easy current of the Gormer existence where
the minor exactions of politeness were unknown or ignored and a man
could either break his engagements or keep them in a paintingjacket and
slippers he still preserved his sense of differences and his
appreciation of graces he had no time to cultivate During the
preparations for the Brys TABLEAUX he had been immensely struck by
Lilys plastic possibilitiesnot the face too selfcontrolled for
expression but the rest of hergad what a model shed makeand
though his abhorrence of the world in which he had seen her was too great
for him to think of seeking her there he was fully alive to the
privilege of having her to look at and listen to while he lounged in
Mattie Gormers dishevelled drawingroom

Lily had thus formed in the tumult of her surroundings a little nucleus
of friendly relations which mitigated the crudeness of her course in
lingering with the Gormers after their return Nor was she without pale
glimpses of her own world especially since the breakingup of the
Newport season had set the social current once more toward Long Island
Kate Corby whose tastes made her as promiscuous as Carry Fisher was
rendered by her necessities occasionally descended on the Gormers
where after a first stare of surprise she took Lilys presence almost
too much as a matter of course Mrs Fisher too appearing frequently in
the neighbourhood drove over to impart her experiences and give Lily
what she called the latest report from the weatherbureau and the
latter who had never directly invited her confidence could yet talk
with her more freely than with Gerty Farish in whose presence it was
impossible even to admit the existence of much that Mrs Fisher
conveniently took for granted

Mrs Fisher moreover had no embarrassing curiosity She did not wish to
probe the inwardness of Lilys situation but simply to view it from the
outside and draw her conclusions accordingly and these conclusions at
the end of a confidential talk she summed up to her friend in the
succinct remark You must marry as soon as you can

Lily uttered a faint laughfor once Mrs Fisher lacked originality Do
you mean like Gerty Farish to recommend the unfailing panacea of a
good mans love

NoI dont think either of my candidates would answer to that
description said Mrs Fisher after a pause of reflection

Either Are there actually two

Well perhaps I ought to say one and a halffor the moment

Miss Bart received this with increasing amusement Other things being
equal I think I should prefer a halfhusband who is he

Dont fly out at me till you hear my reasonsGeorge Dorset

Oh Lily murmured reproachfully but Mrs Fisher pressed on
unrebuffed Well why not They had a few weeks honeymoon when they
first got back from Europe but now things are going badly with them
again Bertha has been behaving more than ever like a madwoman and
Georges powers of credulity are very nearly exhausted Theyre at their
place here you know and I spent last Sunday with them It was a ghastly
partyno one else but poor Neddy Silverton who looks like a
galleyslave they used to talk of my making that poor boy unhappyand
after luncheon George carried me off on a long walk and told me the end
would have to come soon

Miss Bart made an incredulous gesture As far as that goes the end will
never comeBertha will always know how to get him back when she wants
him

Mrs Fisher continued to observe her tentatively Not if he has any one
else to turn to Yesthats just what it comes to the poor creature
cant stand alone And I remember him such a good fellow full of life
and enthusiasm She paused and went on dropping her glance from
Lilys He wouldnt stay with her ten minutes if he KNEW

Knew Miss Bart repeated

What YOU must for instancewith the opportunities youve had If he
had positive proof I mean

Lily interrupted her with a deep blush of displeasure Please let us
drop the subject Carry its too odious to me And to divert her
companions attention she added with an attempt at lightness And your
second candidate We must not forget him

Mrs Fisher echoed her laugh I wonder if youll cry out just as loud if
I saySim Rosedale

Miss Bart did not cry out she sat silent gazing thoughtfully at her
friend The suggestion in truth gave expression to a possibility which
in the last weeks had more than once recurred to her but after a moment
she said carelessly Mr Rosedale wants a wife who can establish him in
the bosom of the Van Osburghs and Trenors

Mrs Fisher caught her up eagerly And so YOU couldwith his money
Dont you see how beautifully it would work out for you both

I dont see any way of making him see it Lily returned with a laugh
intended to dismiss the subject

But in reality it lingered with her long after Mrs Fisher had taken
leave She had seen very little of Rosedale since her annexation by the
Gormers for he was still steadily bent on penetrating to the inner
Paradise from which she was now excluded but once or twice when nothing
better offered he had turned up for a Sunday and on these occasions he
had left her in no doubt as to his view of her situation That he still
admired her was more than ever offensively evident for in the Gormer
circle where he expanded as in his native element there were no
puzzling conventions to check the full expression of his approval But it
was in the quality of his admiration that she read his shrewd estimate of
her case He enjoyed letting the Gormers see that he had known Miss
Lilyshe was Miss Lily to him nowbefore they had had the faintest
social existence enjoyed more especially impressing Paul Morpeth with
the distance to which their intimacy dated back But he let it be felt
that that intimacy was a mere ripple on the surface of a rushing social
current the kind of relaxation which a man of large interests and
manifold preoccupations permits himself in his hours of ease

The necessity of accepting this view of their past relation and of
meeting it in the key of pleasantry prevalent among her new friends was
deeply humiliating to Lily But she dared less than ever to quarrel with
Rosedale She suspected that her rejection rankled among the most
unforgettable of his rebuffs and the fact that he knew something of her
wretched transaction with Trenor and was sure to put the basest
construction on it seemed to place her hopelessly in his power Yet at
Carry Fishers suggestion a new hope had stirred in her Much as she
disliked Rosedale she no longer absolutely despised him For he was
gradually attaining his object in life and that to Lily was always
less despicable than to miss it With the slow unalterable persistency
which she had always felt in him he was making his way through the dense
mass of social antagonisms Already his wealth and the masterly use he
had made of it were giving him an enviable prominence in the world of
affairs and placing Wall Street under obligations which only Fifth
Avenue could repay In response to these claims his name began to figure
on municipal committees and charitable boards he appeared at banquets to
distinguished strangers and his candidacy at one of the fashionable
clubs was discussed with diminishing opposition He had figured once or
twice at the Trenor dinners and had learned to speak with just the right
note of disdain of the big Van Osburgh crushes and all he now needed was
a wife whose affiliations would shorten the last tedious steps of his
ascent It was with that object that a year earlier he had fixed his
affections on Miss Bart but in the interval he had mounted nearer to the
goal while she had lost the power to abbreviate the remaining steps of
the way All this she saw with the clearness of vision that came to her
in moments of despondency It was success that dazzled hershe could
distinguish facts plainly enough in the twilight of failure And the
twilight as she now sought to pierce it was gradually lighted by a
faint spark of reassurance Under the utilitarian motive of Rosedales
wooing she had felt clearly enough the heat of personal inclination
She would not have detested him so heartily had she not known that he
dared to admire her What then if the passion persisted though the
other motive had ceased to sustain it She had never even tried to please
himhe had been drawn to her in spite of her manifest disdain What if
she now chose to exert the power which even in its passive state he had
felt so strongly What if she made him marry her for love now that he
had no other reason for marrying her



Chapter 6

As became persons of their rising consequence the Gormers were engaged
in building a countryhouse on Long Island and it was a part of Miss
Barts duty to attend her hostess on frequent visits of inspection to the
new estate There while Mrs Gormer plunged into problems of lighting
and sanitation Lily had leisure to wander in the bright autumn air
along the treefringed bay to which the land declined Little as she was
addicted to solitude there had come to be moments when it seemed a
welcome escape from the empty noises of her life She was weary of being
swept passively along a current of pleasure and business in which she had
no share weary of seeing other people pursue amusement and squander
money while she felt herself of no more account among them than an
expensive toy in the hands of a spoiled child

It was in this frame of mind that striking back from the shore one
morning into the windings of an unfamiliar lane she came suddenly upon
the figure of George Dorset The Dorset place was in the immediate
neighbourhood of the Gormers newlyacquired estate and in her
motorflights thither with Mrs Gormer Lily had caught one or two
passing glimpses of the couple but they moved in so different an orbit
that she had not considered the possibility of a direct encounter

Dorset swinging along with bent head in moody abstraction did not see
Miss Bart till he was close upon her but the sight instead of bringing
him to a halt as she had halfexpected sent him toward her with an
eagerness which found expression in his opening words

Miss BartYoull shake hands wont you Ive been hoping to meet
youI should have written to you if Id dared His face with its
tossed red hair and straggling moustache had a driven uneasy look as
though life had become an unceasing race between himself and the thoughts
at his heels

The look drew a word of compassionate greeting from Lily and he pressed
on as if encouraged by her tone I wanted to apologizeto ask you to
forgive me for the miserable part I played

She checked him with a quick gesture Dont let us speak of it I was
very sorry for you she said with a tinge of disdain which as she
instantly perceived was not lost on him

He flushed to his haggard eyes flushed so cruelly that she repented the
thrust You might well be you dont knowyou must let me explain I
was deceived abominably deceived

I am still more sorry for you then she interposed without irony
but you must see that I am not exactly the person with whom the subject
can be discussed

He met this with a look of genuine wonder Why not Isnt it to you of
all people that I owe an explanation

No explanation is necessary the situation was perfectly clear to me

Ah he murmured his head drooping again and his irresolute hand
switching at the underbrush along the lane But as Lily made a movement
to pass on he broke out with fresh vehemence Miss Bart for Gods sake
dont turn from me We used to be good friendsyou were always kind to
meand you dont know how I need a friend now

The lamentable weakness of the words roused a motion of pity in Lilys
breast She too needed friendsshe had tasted the pang of loneliness
and her resentment of Bertha Dorsets cruelty softened her heart to the
poor wretch who was after all the chief of Berthas victims

I still wish to be kind I feel no illwill toward you she said But
you must understand that after what has happened we cant be friends
againwe cant see each other

Ah you ARE kindyoure mercifulyou always were He fixed his
miserable gaze on her But why cant we be friendswhy not when Ive
repented in dust and ashes Isnt it hard that you should condemn me to
suffer for the falseness the treachery of others I was punished enough
at the timeis there to be no respite for me

I should have thought you had found complete respite in the
reconciliation which was effected at my expense Lily began with
renewed impatience but he broke in imploringly Dont put it in that
waywhen thats been the worst of my punishment My God what could I
dowasnt I powerless You were singled out as a sacrifice any word I
might have said would have been turned against you

I have told you I dont blame you all I ask you to understand is that
after the use Bertha chose to make of meafter all that her behaviour
has since impliedits impossible that you and I should meet

He continued to stand before her in his dogged weakness Is itneed it
be Mightnt there be circumstances he checked himself slashing at
the wayside weeds in a wider radius Then he began again Miss Bart
listengive me a minute If were not to meet again at least let me
have a hearing now You say we cant be friends afterafter what has
happened But cant I at least appeal to your pity Cant I move you if I
ask you to think of me as a prisonera prisoner you alone can set free

Lilys inward start betrayed itself in a quick blush was it possible
that this was really the sense of Carry Fishers adumbrations

I cant see how I can possibly be of any help to you she murmured
drawing back a little from the mounting excitement of his look

Her tone seemed to sober him as it had so often done in his stormiest
moments The stubborn lines of his face relaxed and he said with an
abrupt drop to docility You WOULD see if youd be as merciful as you
used to be and heaven knows Ive never needed it more

She paused a moment moved in spite of herself by this reminder of her
influence over him Her fibres had been softened by suffering and the
sudden glimpse into his mocked and broken life disarmed her contempt for
his weakness

I am very sorry for youI would help you willingly but you must have
other friends other advisers

I never had a friend like you he answered simply And besidescant
you seeyoure the only personhis voice dropped to a whisperthe
only person who knows

Again she felt her colour change again her heart rose in precipitate
throbs to meet what she felt was coming He lifted his eyes to her
entreatingly You do see dont you You understand Im desperateIm
at the end of my tether I want to be free and you can free me I know
you can You dont want to keep me bound fast in hell do you You cant
want to take such a vengeance as that You were always kindyour eyes
are kind now You say youre sorry for me Well it rests with you to
show it and heaven knows theres nothing to keep you back You
understand of coursethere wouldnt be a hint of publicitynot a sound
or a syllable to connect you with the thing It would never come to that
you know all I need is to be able to say definitely I know thisand
thisand thisand the fight would drop and the way be cleared and
the whole abominable business swept out of sight in a second

He spoke pantingly like a tired runner with breaks of exhaustion
between his words and through the breaks she caught as through the
shifting rents of a fog great golden vistas of peace and safety For
there was no mistaking the definite intention behind his vague appeal
she could have filled up the blanks without the help of Mrs Fishers
insinuations Here was a man who turned to her in the extremity of his
loneliness and his humiliation if she came to him at such a moment he
would be hers with all the force of his deluded faith And the power to
make him so lay in her handlay there in a completeness he could not
even remotely conjecture Revenge and rehabilitation might be hers at a
strokethere was something dazzling in the completeness of the
opportunity

She stood silent gazing away from him down the autumnal stretch of the
deserted lane And suddenly fear possessed herfear of herself and of
the terrible force of the temptation All her past weaknesses were like
so many eager accomplices drawing her toward the path their feet had
already smoothed She turned quickly and held out her hand to Dorset

GoodbyeIm sorry theres nothing in the world that I can do

Nothing Ah dont say that he cried say whats true that you
abandon me like the others You the only creature who could have saved
me

Goodbyegoodbye she repeated hurriedly and as she moved away she
heard him cry out on a last note of entreaty At least youll let me see
you once more



Lily on regaining the Gormer grounds struck rapidly across the lawn
toward the unfinished house where she fancied that her hostess might be
speculating not too resignedly on the cause of her delay for like
many unpunctual persons Mrs Gormer disliked to be kept waiting

As Miss Bart reached the avenue however she saw a smart phaeton with a
highstepping pair disappear behind the shrubbery in the direction of the
gate and on the doorstep stood Mrs Gormer with a glow of retrospective
pleasure on her open countenance At sight of Lily the glow deepened to
an embarrassed red and she said with a slight laugh Did you see my
visitor Oh I thought you came back by the avenue It was Mrs George
Dorsetshe said shed dropped in to make a neighbourly call

Lily met the announcement with her usual composure though her experience
of Berthas idiosyncrasies would not have led her to include the
neighbourly instinct among them and Mrs Gormer relieved to see that
she gave no sign of surprise went on with a deprecating laugh Of
course what really brought her was curiosityshe made me take her all
over the house But no one could have been nicerno airs you know and
so goodnatured I can quite see why people think her so fascinating

This surprising event coinciding too completely with her meeting with
Dorset to be regarded as contingent upon it had yet immediately struck
Lily with a vague sense of foreboding It was not in Berthas habits to
be neighbourly much less to make advances to any one outside the
immediate circle of her affinities She had always consistently ignored
the world of outer aspirants or had recognized its individual members
only when prompted by motives of selfinterest and the very
capriciousness of her condescensions had as Lily was aware given them
special value in the eyes of the persons she distinguished Lily saw this
now in Mrs Gormers unconcealable complacency and in the happy
irrelevance with which for the next day or two she quoted Berthas
opinions and speculated on the origin of her gown All the secret
ambitions which Mrs Gormers native indolence and the attitude of her
companions kept in habitual abeyance were now germinating afresh in the
glow of Berthas advances and whatever the cause of the latter Lily saw
that if they were followed up they were likely to have a disturbing
effect upon her own future

She had arranged to break the length of her stay with her new friends by
one or two visits to other acquaintances as recent and on her return
from this somewhat depressing excursion she was immediately conscious
that Mrs Dorsets influence was still in the air There had been another
exchange of visits a tea at a countryclub an encounter at a hunt ball
there was even a rumour of an approaching dinner which Mattie Gormer
with an unnatural effort at discretion tried to smuggle out of the
conversation whenever Miss Bart took part in it

The latter had already planned to return to town after a farewell Sunday
with her friends and with Gerty Farishs aid had discovered a small
private hotel where she might establish herself for the winter The
hotel being on the edge of a fashionable neighbourhood the price of the
few square feet she was to occupy was considerably in excess of her
means but she found a justification for her dislike of poorer quarters
in the argument that at this particular juncture it was of the utmost
importance to keep up a show of prosperity In reality it was impossible
for her while she had the means to pay her way for a week ahead to
lapse into a form of existence like Gerty Farishs She had never been so
near the brink of insolvency but she could at least manage to meet her
weekly hotel bill and having settled the heaviest of her previous debts
out of the money she had received from Trenor she had a still fair
margin of credit to go upon The situation however was not agreeable
enough to lull her to complete unconsciousness of its insecurity Her
rooms with their cramped outlook down a sallow vista of brick walls and
fireescapes her lonely meals in the dark restaurant with its surcharged
ceiling and haunting smell of coffeeall these material discomforts
which were yet to be accounted as so many privileges soon to be
withdrawn kept constantly before her the disadvantages of her state and
her mind reverted the more insistently to Mrs Fishers counsels Beat
about the question as she would she knew the outcome of it was that she
must try to marry Rosedale and in this conviction she was fortified by
an unexpected visit from George Dorset

She found him on the first Sunday after her return to town pacing her
narrow sittingroom to the imminent peril of the few knickknacks with
which she had tried to disguise its plush exuberances but the sight of
her seemed to quiet him and he said meekly that he hadnt come to bother
herthat he asked only to be allowed to sit for half an hour and talk of
anything she liked In reality as she knew he had but one subject
himself and his wretchedness and it was the need of her sympathy that
had drawn him back But he began with a pretence of questioning her about
herself and as she replied she saw that for the first time a faint
realization of her plight penetrated the dense surface of his
selfabsorption Was it possible that her old beast of an aunt had
actually cut her off That she was living alone like this because there
was no one else for her to go to and that she really hadnt more than
enough to keep alive on till the wretched little legacy was paid The
fibres of sympathy were nearly atrophied in him but he was suffering so
intensely that he had a faint glimpse of what other sufferings might
meanand as she perceived an almost simultaneous perception of the way
in which her particular misfortunes might serve him

When at length she dismissed him on the pretext that she must dress for
dinner he lingered entreatingly on the threshold to blurt out Its
been such a comfortdo say youll let me see you again But to this
direct appeal it was impossible to give an assent and she said with
friendly decisiveness Im sorrybut you know why I cant

He coloured to the eyes pushed the door shut and stood before her
embarrassed but insistent I know how you might if you wouldif things
were differentand it lies with you to make them so Its just a word to
say and you put me out of my misery

Their eyes met and for a second she trembled again with the nearness of
the temptation Youre mistaken I know nothing I saw nothing she
exclaimed striving by sheer force of reiteration to build a barrier
between herself and her peril and as he turned away groaning out You
sacrifice us both she continued to repeat as if it were a charm I
know nothingabsolutely nothing



Lily had seen little of Rosedale since her illuminating talk with Mrs
Fisher but on the two or three occasions when they had met she was
conscious of having distinctly advanced in his favour There could be no
doubt that he admired her as much as ever and she believed it rested
with herself to raise his admiration to the point where it should bear
down the lingering counsels of expediency The task was not an easy one
but neither was it easy in her long sleepless nights to face the
thought of what George Dorset was so clearly ready to offer Baseness
for baseness she hated the other least there were even moments when a
marriage with Rosedale seemed the only honourable solution of her
difficulties She did not indeed let her imagination range beyond the day
of plighting after that everything faded into a haze of material
wellbeing in which the personality of her benefactor remained
mercifully vague She had learned in her long vigils that there were
certain things not good to think of certain midnight images that must at
any cost be exorcisedand one of these was the image of herself as
Rosedales wife

Carry Fisher on the strength as she frankly owned of the Brys Newport
success had taken for the autumn months a small house at Tuxedo and
thither Lily was bound on the Sunday after Dorsets visit Though it was
nearly dinnertime when she arrived her hostess was still out and the
firelit quiet of the small silent house descended on her spirit with a
sense of peace and familiarity It may be doubted if such an emotion had
ever before been evoked by Carry Fishers surroundings but contrasted
to the world in which Lily had lately lived there was an air of repose
and stability in the very placing of the furniture and in the quiet
competence of the parlourmaid who led her up to her room Mrs Fishers
unconventionality was after all a merely superficial divergence from an
inherited social creed while the manners of the Gormer circle
represented their first attempt to formulate such a creed for themselves

It was the first time since her return from Europe that Lily had found
herself in a congenial atmosphere and the stirring of familiar
associations had almost prepared her as she descended the stairs before
dinner to enter upon a group of her old acquaintances But this
expectation was instantly checked by the reflection that the friends who
remained loyal were precisely those who would be least willing to expose
her to such encounters and it was hardly with surprise that she found
instead Mr Rosedale kneeling domestically on the drawingroom hearth
before his hostesss little girl

Rosedale in the paternal role was hardly a figure to soften Lily yet she
could not but notice a quality of homely goodness in his advances to the
child They were not at any rate the premeditated and perfunctory
endearments of the guest under his hostesss eye for he and the little
girl had the room to themselves and something in his attitude made him
seem a simple and kindly being compared to the small critical creature
who endured his homage Yes he would be kindLily from the threshold
had time to feelkind in his gross unscrupulous rapacious way the way
of the predatory creature with his mate She had but a moment in which
to consider whether this glimpse of the fireside man mitigated her
repugnance or gave it rather a more concrete and intimate form for at
sight of her he was immediately on his feet again the florid and
dominant Rosedale of Mattie Gormers drawingroom

It was no surprise to Lily to find that he had been selected as her only
fellowguest Though she and her hostess had not met since the latters
tentative discussion of her future Lily knew that the acuteness which
enabled Mrs Fisher to lay a safe and pleasant course through a world of
antagonistic forces was not infrequently exercised for the benefit of her
friends It was in fact characteristic of Carry that while she
actively gleaned her own stores from the fields of affluence her real
sympathies were on the other sidewith the unlucky the unpopular the
unsuccessful with all her hungry fellowtoilers in the shorn stubble of
success

Mrs Fishers experience guarded her against the mistake of exposing
Lily for the first evening to the unmitigated impression of Rosedales
personality Kate Corby and two or three men dropped in to dinner and
Lily alive to every detail of her friends method saw that such
opportunities as had been contrived for her were to be deferred till she
had as it were gained courage to make effectual use of them She had a
sense of acquiescing in this plan with the passiveness of a sufferer
resigned to the surgeons touch and this feeling of almost lethargic
helplessness continued when after the departure of the guests Mrs
Fisher followed her upstairs

May I come in and smoke a cigarette over your fire If we talk in my
room we shall disturb the child Mrs Fisher looked about her with the
eye of the solicitous hostess I hope youve managed to make yourself
comfortable dear Isnt it a jolly little house Its such a blessing to
have a few quiet weeks with the baby

Carry in her rare moments of prosperity became so expansively maternal
that Miss Bart sometimes wondered whether if she could ever get time and
money enough she would not end by devoting them both to her daughter

Its a wellearned rest Ill say that for myself she continued
sinking down with a sigh of content on the pillowed lounge near the fire
Louisa Bry is a stern taskmaster I often used to wish myself back with
the Gormers Talk of love making people jealous and suspiciousits
nothing to social ambition Louisa used to lie awake at night wondering
whether the women who called on us called on ME because I was with her
or on HER because she was with me and she was always laying traps to
find out what I thought Of course I had to disown my oldest friends
rather than let her suspect she owed me the chance of making a single
acquaintancewhen all the while that was what she had me there for
and what she wrote me a handsome cheque for when the season was over

Mrs Fisher was not a woman who talked of herself without cause and the
practice of direct speech far from precluding in her an occasional
resort to circuitous methods served rather at crucial moments the
purpose of the jugglers chatter while he shifts the contents of his
sleeves Through the haze of her cigarette smoke she continued to gaze
meditatively at Miss Bart who having dismissed her maid sat before the
toilettable shaking out over her shoulders the loosened undulations of
her hair

Your hairs wonderful Lily Thinner What does that matter when its
so light and alive So many womens worries seem to go straight to their
hairbut yours looks as if there had never been an anxious thought under
it I never saw you look better than you did this evening Mattie Gormer
told me that Morpeth wanted to paint youwhy dont you let him

Miss Barts immediate answer was to address a critical glance to the
reflection of the countenance under discussion Then she said with a
slight touch of irritation I dont care to accept a portrait from Paul
Morpeth

Mrs Fisher mused Nno And just now especiallywell he can do you
after youre married She waited a moment and then went on By the
way I had a visit from Mattie the other day She turned up here last
Sundayand with Bertha Dorset of all people in the world

She paused again to measure the effect of this announcement on her
hearer but the brush in Miss Barts lifted hand maintained its
unwavering stroke from brow to nape

I never was more astonished Mrs Fisher pursued I dont know two
women less predestined to intimacyfrom Berthas standpoint that is
for of course poor Mattie thinks it natural enough that she should be
singled outIve no doubt the rabbit always thinks it is fascinating the
anaconda Well you know Ive always told you that Mattie secretly longed
to bore herself with the really fashionable and now that the chance has
come I see that shes capable of sacrificing all her old friends to it

Lily laid aside her brush and turned a penetrating glance upon her
friend Including ME she suggested

Ah my dear murmured Mrs Fisher rising to push back a log from the
hearth

Thats what Bertha means isnt it Miss Bart went on steadily For
of course she always means something and before I left Long Island I saw
that she was beginning to lay her toils for Mattie

Mrs Fisher sighed evasively She has her fast now at any rate To
think of that loud independence of Matties being only a subtler form of
snobbishness Bertha can already make her believe anything she
pleasesand Im afraid shes begun my poor child by insinuating
horrors about you

Lily flushed under the shadow of her drooping hair The world is too
vile she murmured averting herself from Mrs Fishers anxious scrutiny

Its not a pretty place and the only way to keep a footing in it is to
fight it on its own termsand above all my dear not alone Mrs
Fisher gathered up her floating implications in a resolute grasp
Youve told me so little that I can only guess what has been happening
but in the rush we all live in theres no time to keep on hating any one
without a cause and if Bertha is still nasty enough to want to injure
you with other people it must be because shes still afraid of you From
her standpoint theres only one reason for being afraid of you and my
own idea is that if you want to punish her you hold the means in your
hand I believe you can marry George Dorset tomorrow but if you dont
care for that particular form of retaliation the only thing to save you
from Bertha is to marry somebody else



Chapter 7

The light projected on the situation by Mrs Fisher had the cheerless
distinctness of a winter dawn It outlined the facts with a cold
precision unmodified by shade or colour and refracted as it were from
the blank walls of the surrounding limitations she had opened windows
from which no sky was ever visible But the idealist subdued to vulgar
necessities must employ vulgar minds to draw the inferences to which he
cannot stoop and it was easier for Lily to let Mrs Fisher formulate her
case than to put it plainly to herself Once confronted with it however
she went the full length of its consequences and these had never been
more clearly present to her than when the next afternoon she set out
for a walk with Rosedale

It was one of those still November days when the air is haunted with the
light of summer and something in the lines of the landscape and in the
golden haze which bathed them recalled to Miss Bart the September
afternoon when she had climbed the slopes of Bellomont with Selden The
importunate memory was kept before her by its ironic contrast to her
present situation since her walk with Selden had represented an
irresistible flight from just such a climax as the present excursion was
designed to bring about But other memories importuned her also the
recollection of similar situations as skillfully led up to but through
some malice of fortune or her own unsteadiness of purpose always
failing of the intended result Well her purpose was steady enough now
She saw that the whole weary work of rehabilitation must begin again and
against far greater odds if Bertha Dorset should succeed in breaking up
her friendship with the Gormers and her longing for shelter and security
was intensified by the passionate desire to triumph over Bertha as only
wealth and predominance could triumph over her As the wife of
Rosedalethe Rosedale she felt it in her power to createshe would at
least present an invulnerable front to her enemy

She had to draw upon this thought as upon some fiery stimulant to keep
up her part in the scene toward which Rosedale was too frankly tending
As she walked beside him shrinking in every nerve from the way in which
his look and tone made free of her yet telling herself that this
momentary endurance of his mood was the price she must pay for her
ultimate power over him she tried to calculate the exact point at which
concession must turn to resistance and the price HE would have to pay be
made equally clear to him But his dapper selfconfidence seemed
impenetrable to such hints and she had a sense of something hard and
selfcontained behind the superficial warmth of his manner

They had been seated for some time in the seclusion of a rocky glen above
the lake when she suddenly cut short the culmination of an impassioned
period by turning upon him the grave loveliness of her gaze

I DO believe what you say Mr Rosedale she said quietly and I am
ready to marry you whenever you wish

Rosedale reddening to the roots of his glossy hair received this
announcement with a recoil which carried him to his feet where he halted
before her in an attitude of almost comic discomfiture

For I suppose that is what you do wish she continued in the same
quiet tone And though I was unable to consent when you spoke to me in
this way before I am ready now that I know you so much better to trust
my happiness to your hands

She spoke with the noble directness which she could command on such
occasions and which was like a large steady light thrown across the
tortuous darkness of the situation In its inconvenient brightness
Rosedale seemed to waver a moment as though conscious that every avenue
of escape was unpleasantly illuminated

Then he gave a short laugh and drew out a gold cigarettecase in which
with plump jewelled fingers he groped for a goldtipped cigarette
Selecting one he paused to contemplate it a moment before saying My
dear Miss Lily Im sorry if theres been any little misapprehension
between usbut you made me feel my suit was so hopeless that I had really
no intention of renewing it

Lilys blood tingled with the grossness of the rebuff but she checked
the first leap of her anger and said in a tone of gentle dignity I
have no one but myself to blame if I gave you the impression that my
decision was final

Her wordplay was always too quick for him and this reply held him in
puzzled silence while she extended her hand and added with the faintest
inflection of sadness in her voice Before we bid each other goodbye I
want at least to thank you for having once thought of me as you did

The touch of her hand the moving softness of her look thrilled a
vulnerable fibre in Rosedale It was her exquisite inaccessibleness the
sense of distance she could convey without a hint of disdain that made
it most difficult for him to give her up

Why do you talk of saying goodbye Aint we going to be good friends all
the same he urged without releasing her hand

She drew it away quietly What is your idea of being good friends she
returned with a slight smile Making love to me without asking me to
marry you Rosedale laughed with a recovered sense of ease

Well thats about the size of it I suppose I cant help making love
to youI dont see how any man could but I dont mean to ask you to
marry me as long as I can keep out of it

She continued to smile I like your frankness but I am afraid our
friendship can hardly continue on those terms She turned away as
though to mark that its final term had in fact been reached and he
followed her for a few steps with a baffled sense of her having after all
kept the game in her own hands

Miss Lily he began impulsively but she walked on without seeming
to hear him

He overtook her in a few quick strides and laid an entreating hand on
her arm Miss Lilydont hurry away like that Youre beastly hard on a
fellow but if you dont mind speaking the truth I dont see why you
shouldnt allow me to do the same

She had paused a moment with raised brows drawing away instinctively
from his touch though she made no effort to evade his words

I was under the impression she rejoined that you had done so without
waiting for my permission

Wellwhy shouldnt you hear my reasons for doing it then Were
neither of us such new hands that a little plain speaking is going to
hurt us Im all broken up on you theres nothing new in that Im more
in love with you than I was this time last year but Ive got to face the
fact that the situation is changed

She continued to confront him with the same air of ironic composure
You mean to say that Im not as desirable a match as you thought me

Yes thats what I do mean he answered resolutely I wont go into
whats happened I dont believe the stories about youI dont WANT to
believe them But theyre there and my not believing them aint going to
alter the situation

She flushed to her temples but the extremity of her need checked the
retort on her lip and she continued to face him composedly If they are
not true she said doesnt THAT alter the situation

He met this with a steady gaze of his small stocktaking eyes which made
her feel herself no more than some superfine human merchandise I
believe it does in novels but Im certain it dont in real life You
know that as well as I do if were speaking the truth lets speak the
whole truth Last year I was wild to marry you and you wouldnt look at
me this yearwell you appear to be willing Now what has changed in
the interval Your situation thats all Then you thought you could do
better now

You think you can broke from her ironically

Why yes I do in one way that is He stood before her his hands in
his pockets his chest sturdily expanded under its vivid waistcoat
Its this way you see Ive had a pretty steady grind of it these last
years working up my social position Think its funny I should say
that Why should I mind saying I want to get into society A man aint
ashamed to say he wants to own a racing stable or a picture gallery
Well a taste for societys just another kind of hobby Perhaps I want
to get even with some of the people who coldshouldered me last yearput
it that way if it sounds better Anyhow I want to have the run of the
best houses and Im getting it too little by little But I know the
quickest way to queer yourself with the right people is to be seen with
the wrong ones and thats the reason I want to avoid mistakes

Miss Bart continued to stand before him in a silence that might have
expressed either mockery or a halfreluctant respect for his candour and
after a moments pause he went on There it is you see Im more in
love with you than ever but if I married you now Id queer myself for
good and all and everything Ive worked for all these years would be
wasted

She received this with a look from which all tinge of resentment had
faded After the tissue of social falsehoods in which she had so long
moved it was refreshing to step into the open daylight of an avowed
expediency

I understand you she said A year ago I should have been of use to
you and now I should be an encumbrance and I like you for telling me so
quite honestly She extended her hand with a smile

Again the gesture had a disturbing effect upon Mr Rosedales
selfcommand By George youre a dead game sport you are he
exclaimed and as she began once more to move away he broke out
suddenlyMiss Lilystop You know I dont believe those storiesI
believe they were all got up by a woman who didnt hesitate to sacrifice
you to her own convenience

Lily drew away with a movement of quick disdain it was easier to endure
his insolence than his commiseration

You are very kind but I dont think we need discuss the matter farther

But Rosedales natural imperviousness to hints made it easy for him to
brush such resistance aside I dont want to discuss anything I just
want to put a plain case before you he persisted

She paused in spite of herself held by the note of a new purpose in his
look and tone and he went on keeping his eyes firmly upon her The
wonder to me is that youve waited so long to get square with that woman
when youve had the power in your hands She continued silent under the
rush of astonishment that his words produced and he moved a step closer
to ask with lowtoned directness Why dont you use those letters of
hers you bought last year

Lily stood speechless under the shock of the interrogation In the words
preceding it she had conjectured at most an allusion to her supposed
influence over George Dorset nor did the astonishing indelicacy of the
reference diminish the likelihood of Rosedales resorting to it But now
she saw how far short of the mark she had fallen and the surprise of
learning that he had discovered the secret of the letters left her for
the moment unconscious of the special use to which he was in the act of
putting his knowledge

Her temporary loss of selfpossession gave him time to press his point
and he went on quickly as though to secure completer control of the
situation You see I know where you standI know how completely shes
in your power That sounds like stagetalk dont itbut theres a lot
of truth in some of those old gags and I dont suppose you bought those
letters simply because youre collecting autographs

She continued to look at him with a deepening bewilderment her only
clear impression resolved itself into a scared sense of his power

Youre wondering how I found out about em he went on answering her
look with a note of conscious pride Perhaps youve forgotten that Im
the owner of the Benedickbut never mind about that now Getting on to
things is a mighty useful accomplishment in business and Ive simply
extended it to my private affairs For this IS partly my affair you
seeat least it depends on you to make it so Lets look the situation
straight in the eye Mrs Dorset for reasons we neednt go into did you
a beastly bad turn last spring Everybody knows what Mrs Dorset is and
her best friends wouldnt believe her on oath where their own interests
were concerned but as long as theyre out of the row its much easier to
follow her lead than to set themselves against it and youve simply been
sacrificed to their laziness and selfishness Isnt that a pretty fair
statement of the caseWell some people say youve got the neatest kind
of an answer in your hands that George Dorset would marry you tomorrow
if youd tell him all you know and give him the chance to show the lady
the door I daresay he would but you dont seem to care for that
particular form of getting even and taking a purely business view of
the question I think youre right In a deal like that nobody comes out
with perfectly clean hands and the only way for you to start fresh is to
get Bertha Dorset to back you up instead of trying to fight her

He paused long enough to draw breath but not to give her time for the
expression of her gathering resistance and as he pressed on expounding
and elucidating his idea with the directness of the man who has no doubts
of his cause she found the indignation gradually freezing on her lip
found herself held fast in the grasp of his argument by the mere cold
strength of its presentation There was no time now to wonder how he had
heard of her obtaining the letters all her world was dark outside the
monstrous glare of his scheme for using them And it was not after the
first moment the horror of the idea that held her spellbound subdued
to his will it was rather its subtle affinity to her own inmost
cravings He would marry her tomorrow if she could regain Bertha Dorsets
friendship and to induce the open resumption of that friendship and the
tacit retractation of all that had caused its withdrawal she had only to
put to the lady the latent menace contained in the packet so miraculously
delivered into her hands Lily saw in a flash the advantage of this
course over that which poor Dorset had pressed upon her The other plan
depended for its success on the infliction of an open injury while this
reduced the transaction to a private understanding of which no third
person need have the remotest hint Put by Rosedale in terms of
businesslike giveandtake this understanding took on the harmless air
of a mutual accommodation like a transfer of property or a revision of
boundary lines It certainly simplified life to view it as a perpetual
adjustment a play of party politics in which every concession had its
recognized equivalent Lilys tired mind was fascinated by this escape
from fluctuating ethical estimates into a region of concrete weights and
measures

Rosedale as she listened seemed to read in her silence not only a
gradual acquiescence in his plan but a dangerously farreaching
perception of the chances it offered for as she continued to stand
before him without speaking he broke out with a quick return upon
himself You see how simple it is dont you Well dont be carried
away by the idea that its TOO simple It isnt exactly as if youd
started in with a clean bill of health Now were talking lets call
things by their right names and clear the whole business up You know
well enough that Bertha Dorset couldnt have touched you if there hadnt
beenwellquestions asked beforelittle points of interrogation eh
Bound to happen to a goodlooking girl with stingy relatives I suppose
anyhow they DID happen and she found the ground prepared for her Do
you see where Im coming out You dont want these little questions
cropping up again Its one thing to get Bertha Dorset into linebut
what you want is to keep her there You can frighten her fast enoughbut
how are you going to keep her frightened By showing her that youre as
powerful as she is All the letters in the world wont do that for you as
you are now but with a big backing behind you youll keep her just
where you want her to be Thats MY share in the businessthats what
Im offering you You cant put the thing through without medont run
away with any idea that you can In six months youd be back again among
your old worries or worse ones and here I am ready to lift you out of
em tomorrow if you say so DO you say so Miss Lily he added moving
suddenly nearer

The words and the movement which accompanied them combined to startle
Lily out of the state of tranced subservience into which she had
insensibly slipped Light comes in devious ways to the groping
consciousness and it came to her now through the disgusted perception
that her wouldbe accomplice assumed as a matter of course the
likelihood of her distrusting him and perhaps trying to cheat him of his
share of the spoils This glimpse of his inner mind seemed to present the
whole transaction in a new aspect and she saw that the essential
baseness of the act lay in its freedom from risk

She drew back with a quick gesture of rejection saying in a voice that
was a surprise to her own ears You are mistakenquite mistakenboth
in the facts and in what you infer from them

Rosedale stared a moment puzzled by her sudden dash in a direction so
different from that toward which she had appeared to be letting him guide
her

Now what on earth does that mean I thought we understood each other
he exclaimed and to her murmur of Ah we do NOW he retorted with a
sudden burst of violence I suppose its because the letters are to HIM
then Well Ill be damned if I see what thanks youve got from him



Chapter 8

The autumn days declined to winter Once more the leisure world was in
transition between country and town and Fifth Avenue still deserted at
the weekend showed from Monday to Friday a broadening stream of
carriages between housefronts gradually restored to consciousness

The Horse Show some two weeks earlier had produced a passing semblance
of reanimation filling the theatres and restaurants with a human display
of the same costly and highstepping kind as circled daily about its
ring In Miss Barts world the Horse Show and the public it attracted
had ostensibly come to be classed among the spectacles disdained of the
elect but as the feudal lord might sally forth to join in the dance on
his village green so society unofficially and incidentally still
condescended to look in upon the scene Mrs Gormer among the rest was
not above seizing such an occasion for the display of herself and her
horses and Lily was given one or two opportunities of appearing at her
friends side in the most conspicuous box the house afforded But this
lingering semblance of intimacy made her only the more conscious of a
change in the relation between Mattie and herself of a dawning
discrimination a gradually formed social standard emerging from Mrs
Gormers chaotic view of life It was inevitable that Lily herself should
constitute the first sacrifice to this new ideal and she knew that once
the Gormers were established in town the whole drift of fashionable life
would facilitate Matties detachment from her She had in short failed
to make herself indispensable or rather her attempt to do so had been
thwarted by an influence stronger than any she could exert That
influence in its last analysis was simply the power of money Bertha
Dorsets social credit was based on an impregnable bankaccount

Lily knew that Rosedale had overstated neither the difficulty of her own
position nor the completeness of the vindication he offered once
Berthas match in material resources her superior gifts would make it
easy for her to dominate her adversary An understanding of what such
domination would mean and of the disadvantages accruing from her
rejection of it was brought home to Lily with increasing clearness
during the early weeks of the winter Hitherto she had kept up a
semblance of movement outside the main flow of the social current but
with the return to town and the concentrating of scattered activities
the mere fact of not slipping back naturally into her old habits of life
marked her as being unmistakably excluded from them If one were not a
part of the seasons fixed routine one swung unsphered in a void of
social nonexistence Lily for all her dissatisfied dreaming had never
really conceived the possibility of revolving about a different centre
it was easy enough to despise the world but decidedly difficult to find
any other habitable region Her sense of irony never quite deserted her
and she could still note with selfdirected derision the abnormal value
suddenly acquired by the most tiresome and insignificant details of her
former life Its very drudgeries had a charm now that she was
involuntarily released from them cardleaving notewriting enforced
civilities to the dull and elderly and the smiling endurance of tedious
dinnershow pleasantly such obligations would have filled the emptiness
of her days She did indeed leave cards in plenty she kept herself with
a smiling and valiant persistence well in the eye of her world nor did
she suffer any of those gross rebuffs which sometimes produce a wholesome
reaction of contempt in their victim Society did not turn away from her
it simply drifted by preoccupied and inattentive letting her feel to
the full measure of her humbled pride how completely she had been the
creature of its favour

She had rejected Rosedales suggestion with a promptness of scorn almost
surprising to herself she had not lost her capacity for high flashes of
indignation But she could not breathe long on the heights there had
been nothing in her training to develop any continuity of moral strength
what she craved and really felt herself entitled to was a situation in
which the noblest attitude should also be the easiest Hitherto her
intermittent impulses of resistance had sufficed to maintain her
selfrespect If she slipped she recovered her footing and it was only
afterward that she was aware of having recovered it each time on a
slightly lower level She had rejected Rosedales offer without conscious
effort her whole being had risen against it and she did not yet
perceive that by the mere act of listening to him she had learned to
live with ideas which would once have been intolerable to her




To Gerty Farish keeping watch over her with a tenderer if less
discerning eye than Mrs Fishers the results of the struggle were
already distinctly visible She did not indeed know what hostages Lily
had already given to expediency but she saw her passionately and
irretrievably pledged to the ruinous policy of keeping up Gerty could
smile now at her own early dream of her friends renovation through
adversity she understood clearly enough that Lily was not of those to
whom privation teaches the unimportance of what they have lost But this
very fact to Gerty made her friend the more piteously in want of aid
the more exposed to the claims of a tenderness she was so little
conscious of needing

Lily since her return to town had not often climbed Miss Farishs
stairs There was something irritating to her in the mute interrogation
of Gertys sympathy she felt the real difficulties of her situation to
be incommunicable to any one whose theory of values was so different from
her own and the restrictions of Gertys life which had once had the
charm of contrast now reminded her too painfully of the limits to which
her own existence was shrinking When at length one afternoon she put
into execution the belated resolve to visit her friend this sense of
shrunken opportunities possessed her with unusual intensity The walk up
Fifth Avenue unfolding before her in the brilliance of the hard winter
sunlight an interminable procession of fastidiouslyequipped
carriagesgiving her through the little squares of broughamwindows
peeps of familiar profiles bent above visitinglists of hurried hands
dispensing notes and cards to attendant footmenthis glimpse of the
everrevolving wheels of the great social machine made Lily more than
ever conscious of the steepness and narrowness of Gertys stairs and of
the cramped blind alley of life to which they led Dull stairs destined
to be mounted by dull people how many thousands of insignificant figures
were going up and down such stairs all over the world at that very
momentfigures as shabby and uninteresting as that of the middleaged
lady in limp black who descended Gertys flight as Lily climbed to it

That was poor Miss Jane Silvertonshe came to talk things over with me
she and her sister want to do something to support themselves Gerty
explained as Lily followed her into the sittingroom

To support themselves Are they so hard up Miss Bart asked with a
touch of irritation she had not come to listen to the woes of other
people

Im afraid they have nothing left Neds debts have swallowed up
everything They had such hopes you know when he broke away from Carry
Fisher they thought Bertha Dorset would be such a good influence
because she doesnt care for cards andwell she talked quite
beautifully to poor Miss Jane about feeling as if Ned were her younger
brother and wanting to carry him off on the yacht so that he might have
a chance to drop cards and racing and take up his literary work again

Miss Farish paused with a sigh which reflected the perplexity of her
departing visitor But that isnt all it isnt even the worst It seems
that Ned has quarrelled with the Dorsets or at least Bertha wont allow
him to see her and he is so unhappy about it that he has taken to
gambling again and going about with all sorts of queer people And
cousin Grace Van Osburgh accuses him of having had a very bad influence
on Freddy who left Harvard last spring and has been a great deal with
Ned ever since She sent for Miss Jane and made a dreadful scene and
Jack Stepney and Herbert Melson who were there too told Miss Jane that
Freddy was threatening to marry some dreadful woman to whom Ned had
introduced him and that they could do nothing with him because now hes
of age he has his own money You can fancy how poor Miss Jane feltshe
came to me at once and seemed to think that if I could get her something
to do she could earn enough to pay Neds debts and send him awayIm
afraid she has no idea how long it would take her to pay for one of his
evenings at bridge And he was horribly in debt when he came back from
the cruiseI cant see why he should have spent so much more money under
Berthas influence than Carrys can you

Lily met this query with an impatient gesture My dear Gerty I always
understand how people can spend much more moneynever how they can spend
any less

She loosened her furs and settled herself in Gertys easychair while
her friend busied herself with the teacups

But what can they dothe Miss Silvertons How do they mean to support
themselves she asked conscious that the note of irritation still
persisted in her voice It was the very last topic she had meant to
discussit really did not interest her in the leastbut she was seized
by a sudden perverse curiosity to know how the two colourless shrinking
victims of young Silvertons sentimental experiments meant to cope with
the grim necessity which lurked so close to her own threshold

I dont knowI am trying to find something for them Miss Jane reads
aloud very nicelybut its so hard to find any one who is willing to be
read to And Miss Annie paints a little

Oh I knowappleblossoms on blottingpaper just the kind of thing I
shall be doing myself before long exclaimed Lily starting up with a
vehemence of movement that threatened destruction to Miss Farishs
fragile teatable

Lily bent over to steady the cups then she sank back into her seat
Id forgotten there was no room to dash about inhow beautifully one
does have to behave in a small flat Oh Gerty I wasnt meant to be
good she sighed out incoherently

Gerty lifted an apprehensive look to her pale face in which the eyes
shone with a peculiar sleepless lustre

You look horribly tired Lily take your tea and let me give you this
cushion to lean against

Miss Bart accepted the cup of tea but put back the cushion with an
impatient hand

Dont give me that I dont want to lean backI shall go to sleep if I
do

Well why not dear Ill be as quiet as a mouse Gerty urged
affectionately

Nono dont be quiet talk to mekeep me awake I dont sleep at
night and in the afternoon a dreadful drowsiness creeps over me

You dont sleep at night Since when

I dont knowI cant remember She rose and put the empty cup on the
teatray Another and stronger please if I dont keep awake now I
shall see horrors tonightperfect horrors

But theyll be worse if you drink too much tea

No nogive it to me and dont preach please Lily returned
imperiously Her voice had a dangerous edge and Gerty noticed that her
hand shook as she held it out to receive the second cup

But you look so tired Im sure you must be ill

Miss Bart set down her cup with a start Do I look ill Does my face
show it She rose and walked quickly toward the little mirror above the
writingtable What a horrid lookingglassits all blotched and
discoloured Any one would look ghastly in it She turned back fixing
her plaintive eyes on Gerty You stupid dear why do you say such odious
things to me Its enough to make one ill to be told one looks so And
looking ill means looking ugly She caught Gertys wrists and drew her
close to the window After all Id rather know the truth Look me
straight in the face Gerty and tell me am I perfectly frightful

Youre perfectly beautiful now Lily your eyes are shining and your
cheeks have grown so pink all of a sudden

Ah they WERE pale thenghastly pale when I came in Why dont you
tell me frankly that Im a wreck My eyes are bright now because Im so
nervousbut in the mornings they look like lead And I can see the lines
coming in my facethe lines of worry and disappointment and failure
Every sleepless night leaves a new oneand how can I sleep when I have
such dreadful things to think about

Dreadful thingswhat things asked Gerty gently detaching her wrists
from her friends feverish fingers

What things Well poverty for oneand I dont know any thats more
dreadful Lily turned away and sank with sudden weariness into the
easychair near the teatable You asked me just now if I could
understand why Ned Silverton spent so much money Of course I
understandhe spends it on living with the rich You think we live ON
the rich rather than with them and so we do in a sensebut its a
privilege we have to pay for We eat their dinners and drink their wine
and smoke their cigarettes and use their carriages and their operaboxes
and their private carsyes but theres a tax to pay on every one of
those luxuries The man pays it by big tips to the servants by playing
cards beyond his means by flowers and presentsandandlots of other
things that cost the girl pays it by tips and cards toooh yes Ive
had to take up bridge againand by going to the best dressmakers and
having just the right dress for every occasion and always keeping
herself fresh and exquisite and amusing

She leaned back for a moment closing her eyes and as she sat there her
pale lips slightly parted and the lids dropped above her fagged
brilliant gaze Gerty had a startled perception of the change in her
faceof the way in which an ashen daylight seemed suddenly to extinguish
its artificial brightness She looked up and the vision vanished

It doesnt sound very amusing does it And it isntIm sick to death
of it And yet the thought of giving it all up nearly kills meits what
keeps me awake at night and makes me so crazy for your strong tea For I
cant go on in this way much longer you knowIm nearly at the end of
my tether And then what can I dohow on earth am I to keep myself
alive I see myself reduced to the fate of that poor Silverton
womanslinking about to employment agencies and trying to sell painted
blottingpads to Womens Exchanges And there are thousands and thousands
of women trying to do the same thing already and not one of the number
who has less idea how to earn a dollar than I have

She rose again with a hurried glance at the clock Its late and I must
be offI have an appointment with Carry Fisher Dont look so worried
you dear thingdont think too much about the nonsense Ive been
talking She was before the mirror again adjusting her hair with a
light hand drawing down her veil and giving a dexterous touch to her
furs Of course you know it hasnt come to the employment agencies and
the painted blottingpads yet but Im rather hardup just for the
moment and if I could find something to donotes to write and
visitinglists to make up or that kind of thingit would tide me over
till the legacy is paid And Carry has promised to find somebody who
wants a kind of social secretaryyou know she makes a specialty of the
helpless rich




Miss Bart had not revealed to Gerty the full extent of her anxiety She
was in fact in urgent and immediate need of money money to meet the
vulgar weekly claims which could neither be deferred nor evaded To give
up her apartment and shrink to the obscurity of a boardinghouse or the
provisional hospitality of a bed in Gerty Farishs sittingroom was an
expedient which could only postpone the problem confronting her and it
seemed wiser as well as more agreeable to remain where she was and find
some means of earning her living The possibility of having to do this
was one which she had never before seriously considered and the
discovery that as a breadwinner she was likely to prove as helpless
and ineffectual as poor Miss Silverton was a severe shock to her
selfconfidence

Having been accustomed to take herself at the popular valuation as a
person of energy and resource naturally fitted to dominate any situation
in which she found herself she vaguely imagined that such gifts would be
of value to seekers after social guidance but there was unfortunately no
specific head under which the art of saying and doing the right thing
could be offered in the market and even Mrs Fishers resourcefulness
failed before the difficulty of discovering a workable vein in the vague
wealth of Lilys graces Mrs Fisher was full of indirect expedients for
enabling her friends to earn a living and could conscientiously assert
that she had put several opportunities of this kind before Lily but more
legitimate methods of breadwinning were as much out of her line as they
were beyond the capacity of the sufferers she was generally called upon
to assist Lilys failure to profit by the chances already afforded her
might moreover have justified the abandonment of farther effort on her
behalf but Mrs Fishers inexhaustible goodnature made her an adept at
creating artificial demands in response to an actual supply In the
pursuance of this end she at once started on a voyage of discovery in
Miss Barts behalf and as the result of her explorations she now
summoned the latter with the announcement that she had found something




Left to herself Gerty mused distressfully upon her friends plight and
her own inability to relieve it It was clear to her that Lily for the
present had no wish for the kind of help she could give Miss Farish
could see no hope for her friend but in a life completely reorganized and
detached from its old associations whereas all Lilys energies were
centred in the determined effort to hold fast to those associations to
keep herself visibly identified with them as long as the illusion could
be maintained Pitiable as such an attitude seemed to Gerty she could
not judge it as harshly as Selden for instance might have done She had
not forgotten the night of emotion when she and Lily had lain in each
others arms and she had seemed to feel her very hearts blood passing
into her friend The sacrifice she had made had seemed unavailing enough
no trace remained in Lily of the subduing influences of that hour but
Gertys tenderness disciplined by long years of contact with obscure and
inarticulate suffering could wait on its object with a silent
forbearance which took no account of time She could not however deny
herself the solace of taking anxious counsel with Lawrence Selden with
whom since his return from Europe she had renewed her old relation of
cousinly confidence

Selden himself had never been aware of any change in their relation He
found Gerty as he had left her simple undemanding and devoted but with
a quickened intelligence of the heart which he recognized without seeking
to explain it To Gerty herself it would once have seemed impossible that
she should ever again talk freely with him of Lily Bart but what had
passed in the secrecy of her own breast seemed to resolve itself when
the mist of the struggle cleared into a breaking down of the bounds of
self a deflecting of the wasted personal emotion into the general
current of human understanding

It was not till some two weeks after her visit from Lily that Gerty had
the opportunity of communicating her fears to Selden The latter having
presented himself on a Sunday afternoon had lingered on through the
dowdy animation of his cousins teahour conscious of something in her
voice and eye which solicited a word apart and as soon as the last
visitor was gone Gerty opened her case by asking how lately he had seen
Miss Bart

Seldens perceptible pause gave her time for a slight stir of surprise

I havent seen her at allIve perpetually missed seeing her since she
came back

This unexpected admission made Gerty pause too and she was still
hesitating on the brink of her subject when he relieved her by adding
Ive wanted to see herbut she seems to have been absorbed by the
Gormer set since her return from Europe

Thats all the more reason shes been very unhappy

Unhappy at being with the Gormers

Oh I dont defend her intimacy with the Gormers but that too is at an
end now I think You know people have been very unkind since Bertha
Dorset quarrelled with her

Ah Selden exclaimed rising abruptly to walk to the window where
he remained with his eyes on the darkening street while his cousin
continued to explain Judy Trenor and her own family have deserted her
tooand all because Bertha Dorset has said such horrible things And she
is very pooryou know Mrs Peniston cut her off with a small legacy
after giving her to understand that she was to have everything

YesI know Selden assented curtly turning back into the room but
only to stir about with restless steps in the circumscribed space between
door and window Yesshes been abominably treated but its
unfortunately the precise thing that a man who wants to show his sympathy
cant say to her

His words caused Gerty a slight chill of disappointment There would be
other ways of showing your sympathy she suggested

Selden with a slight laugh sat down beside her on the little sofa which
projected from the hearth What are you thinking of you incorrigible
missionary he asked

Gertys colour rose and her blush was for a moment her only answer
Then she made it more explicit by saying I am thinking of the fact that
you and she used to be great friendsthat she used to care immensely for
what you thought of herand that if she takes your staying away as a
sign of what you think now I can imagine its adding a great deal to her
unhappiness

My dear child dont add to it still moreat least to your conception
of itby attributing to her all sorts of susceptibilities of your own
Selden for his life could not keep a note of dryness out of his voice
but he met Gertys look of perplexity by saying more mildly But though
you immensely exaggerate the importance of anything I could do for Miss
Bart you cant exaggerate my readiness to do itif you ask me to He
laid his hand for a moment on hers and there passed between them on the
current of the rare contact one of those exchanges of meaning which fill
the hidden reservoirs of affection Gerty had the feeling that he
measured the cost of her request as plainly as she read the significance
of his reply and the sense of all that was suddenly clear between them
made her next words easier to find

I do ask you then I ask you because she once told me that you had been
a help to her and because she needs help now as she has never needed it
before You know how dependent she has always been on ease and
luxuryhow she has hated what was shabby and ugly and uncomfortable She
cant help itshe was brought up with those ideas and has never been
able to find her way out of them But now all the things she cared for
have been taken from her and the people who taught her to care for them
have abandoned her too and it seems to me that if some one could reach
out a hand and show her the other sideshow her how much is left in life
and in herself Gerty broke off abashed at the sound of her own
eloquence and impeded by the difficulty of giving precise expression to
her vague yearning for her friends retrieval I cant help her myself
shes passed out of my reach she continued I think shes afraid of
being a burden to me When she was last here two weeks ago she seemed
dreadfully worried about her future she said Carry Fisher was trying to
find something for her to do A few days later she wrote me that she had
taken a position as private secretary and that I was not to be anxious
for everything was all right and she would come in and tell me about it
when she had time but she has never come and I dont like to go to her
because I am afraid of forcing myself on her when Im not wanted Once
when we were children and I had rushed up after a long separation and
thrown my arms about her she said Please dont kiss me unless I ask
you to Gertyand she DID ask me a minute later but since then Ive
always waited to be asked

Selden had listened in silence with the concentrated look which his thin
dark face could assume when he wished to guard it against any involuntary
change of expression When his cousin ended he said with a slight smile
Since youve learned the wisdom of waiting I dont see why you urge me
to rush in but the troubled appeal of her eyes made him add as he
rose to take leave Still Ill do what you wish and not hold you
responsible for my failure

Seldens avoidance of Miss Bart had not been as unintentional as he had
allowed his cousin to think At first indeed while the memory of their
last hour at Monte Carlo still held the full heat of his indignation he
had anxiously watched for her return but she had disappointed him by
lingering in England and when she finally reappeared it happened that
business had called him to the West whence he came back only to learn
that she was starting for Alaska with the Gormers The revelation of this
suddenlyestablished intimacy effectually chilled his desire to see her
If at a moment when her whole life seemed to be breaking up she could
cheerfully commit its reconstruction to the Gormers there was no reason
why such accidents should ever strike her as irreparable Every step she
took seemed in fact to carry her farther from the region where once or
twice he and she had met for an illumined moment and the recognition of
this fact when its first pang had been surmounted produced in him a
sense of negative relief It was much simpler for him to judge Miss Bart
by her habitual conduct than by the rare deviations from it which had
thrown her so disturbingly in his way and every act of hers which made
the recurrence of such deviations more unlikely confirmed the sense of
relief with which he returned to the conventional view of her

But Gerty Farishs words had sufficed to make him see how little this
view was really his and how impossible it was for him to live quietly
with the thought of Lily Bart To hear that she was in need of helpeven
such vague help as he could offerwas to be at once repossessed by that
thought and by the time he reached the street he had sufficiently
convinced himself of the urgency of his cousins appeal to turn his steps
directly toward Lilys hotel

There his zeal met a check in the unforeseen news that Miss Bart had
moved away but on his pressing his enquiries the clerk remembered that
she had left an address for which he presently began to search through
his books

It was certainly strange that she should have taken this step without
letting Gerty Farish know of her decision and Selden waited with a vague
sense of uneasiness while the address was sought for The process lasted
long enough for uneasiness to turn to apprehension but when at length a
slip of paper was handed him and he read on it Care of Mrs Norma
Hatch Emporium Hotel his apprehension passed into an incredulous
stare and this into the gesture of disgust with which he tore the paper
in two and turned to walk quickly homeward



Chapter 9

When Lily woke on the morning after her translation to the Emporium
Hotel her first feeling was one of purely physical satisfaction The
force of contrast gave an added keenness to the luxury of lying once more
in a softpillowed bed and looking across a spacious sunlit room at a
breakfasttable set invitingly near the fire Analysis and introspection
might come later but for the moment she was not even troubled by the
excesses of the upholstery or the restless convolutions of the furniture
The sense of being once more lapped and folded in ease as in some dense
mild medium impenetrable to discomfort effectually stilled the faintest
note of criticism

When the afternoon before she had presented herself to the lady to whom
Carry Fisher had directed her she had been conscious of entering a new
world Carrys vague presentment of Mrs Norma Hatch whose reversion to
her Christian name was explained as the result of her latest divorce
left her under the implication of coming from the West with the not
unusual extenuation of having brought a great deal of money with her She
was in short rich helpless unplaced the very subject for Lilys
hand Mrs Fisher had not specified the line her friend was to take she
owned herself unacquainted with Mrs Hatch whom she knew about through
Melville Stancy a lawyer in his leisure moments and the Falstaff of a
certain section of festive club life Socially Mr Stancy might have
been said to form a connecting link between the Gormer world and the more
dimlylit region on which Miss Bart now found herself entering It was
however only figuratively that the illumination of Mrs Hatchs world
could be described as dim in actual fact Lily found her seated in a
blaze of electric light impartially projected from various ornamental
excrescences on a vast concavity of pink damask and gilding from which
she rose like Venus from her shell The analogy was justified by the
appearance of the lady whose largeeyed prettiness had the fixity of
something impaled and shown under glass This did not preclude the
immediate discovery that she was some years younger than her visitor and
that under her showiness her ease the aggression of her dress and
voice there persisted that ineradicable innocence which in ladies of
her nationality so curiously coexists with startling extremes of
experience

The environment in which Lily found herself was as strange to her as its
inhabitants She was unacquainted with the world of the fashionable New
York hotela world overheated overupholstered and overfitted with
mechanical appliances for the gratification of fantastic requirements
while the comforts of a civilized life were as unattainable as in a
desert Through this atmosphere of torrid splendour moved wan beings as
richly upholstered as the furniture beings without definite pursuits or
permanent relations who drifted on a languid tide of curiosity from
restaurant to concerthall from palmgarden to musicroom from art
exhibit to dressmakers opening Highstepping horses or elaborately
equipped motors waited to carry these ladies into vague metropolitan
distances whence they returned still more wan from the weight of their
sables to be sucked back into the stifling inertia of the hotel routine
Somewhere behind them in the background of their lives there was
doubtless a real past peopled by real human activities they themselves
were probably the product of strong ambitions persistent energies
diversified contacts with the wholesome roughness of life yet they had
no more real existence than the poets shades in limbo

Lily had not been long in this pallid world without discovering that Mrs
Hatch was its most substantial figure That lady though still floating
in the void showed faint symptoms of developing an outline and in this
endeavour she was actively seconded by Mr Melville Stancy It was Mr
Stancy a man of large resounding presence suggestive of convivial
occasions and of a chivalry finding expression in firstnight boxes and
thousand dollar bonbonnieres who had transplanted Mrs Hatch from the
scene of her first development to the higher stage of hotel life in the
metropolis It was he who had selected the horses with which she had
taken the blue ribbon at the Show had introduced her to the photographer
whose portraits of her formed the recurring ornament of Sunday
Supplements and had got together the group which constituted her social
world It was a small group still with heterogeneous figures suspended
in large unpeopled spaces but Lily did not take long to learn that its
regulation was no longer in Mr Stancys hands As often happens the
pupil had outstripped the teacher and Mrs Hatch was already aware of
heights of elegance as well as depths of luxury beyond the world of the
Emporium This discovery at once produced in her a craving for higher
guidance for the adroit feminine hand which should give the right turn
to her correspondence the right look to her hats the right succession
to the items of her MENUS It was in short as the regulator of a
germinating social life that Miss Barts guidance was required her
ostensible duties as secretary being restricted by the fact that Mrs
Hatch as yet knew hardly any one to write to

The daily details of Mrs Hatchs existence were as strange to Lily as
its general tenor The ladys habits were marked by an Oriental indolence
and disorder peculiarly trying to her companion Mrs Hatch and her
friends seemed to float together outside the bounds of time and space No
definite hours were kept no fixed obligations existed night and day
flowed into one another in a blur of confused and retarded engagements
so that one had the impression of lunching at the teahour while dinner
was often merged in the noisy aftertheatre supper which prolonged Mrs
Hatchs vigil till daylight

Through this jumble of futile activities came and went a strange throng
of hangersonmanicures beautydoctors hairdressers teachers of
bridge of French of physical development figures sometimes
indistinguishable by their appearance or by Mrs Hatchs relation to
them from the visitors constituting her recognized society But
strangest of all to Lily was the encounter in this latter group of
several of her acquaintances She had supposed and not without relief
that she was passing for the moment completely out of her own circle
but she found that Mr Stancy one side of whose sprawling existence
overlapped the edge of Mrs Fishers world had drawn several of its
brightest ornaments into the circle of the Emporium To find Ned
Silverton among the habitual frequenters of Mrs Hatchs drawingroom was
one of Lilys first astonishments but she soon discovered that he was
not Mr Stancys most important recruit It was on little Freddy Van
Osburgh the small slim heir of the Van Osburgh millions that the
attention of Mrs Hatchs group was centred Freddy barely out of
college had risen above the horizon since Lilys eclipse and she now
saw with surprise what an effulgence he shed on the outer twilight of
Mrs Hatchs existence This then was one of the things that young men
went in for when released from the official social routine this was
the kind of previous engagement that so frequently caused them to
disappoint the hopes of anxious hostesses Lily had an odd sense of being
behind the social tapestry on the side where the threads were knotted
and the loose ends hung For a moment she found a certain amusement in
the show and in her own share of it the situation had an ease and
unconventionality distinctly refreshing after her experience of the irony
of conventions But these flashes of amusement were but brief reactions
from the long disgust of her days Compared with the vast gilded void of
Mrs Hatchs existence the life of Lilys former friends seemed packed
with ordered activities Even the most irresponsible pretty woman of her
acquaintance had her inherited obligations her conventional
benevolences her share in the working of the great civic machine and
all hung together in the solidarity of these traditional functions The
performance of specific duties would have simplified Miss Barts
position but the vague attendance on Mrs Hatch was not without its
perplexities

It was not her employer who created these perplexities Mrs Hatch showed
from the first an almost touching desire for Lilys approval Far from
asserting the superiority of wealth her beautiful eyes seemed to urge
the plea of inexperience she wanted to do what was nice to be taught
how to be lovely The difficulty was to find any point of contact
between her ideals and Lilys

Mrs Hatch swam in a haze of indeterminate enthusiasms of aspirations
culled from the stage the newspapers the fashion journals and a gaudy
world of sport still more completely beyond her companions ken To
separate from these confused conceptions those most likely to advance the
lady on her way was Lilys obvious duty but its performance was
hampered by rapidlygrowing doubts Lily was in fact becoming more and
more aware of a certain ambiguity in her situation It was not that she
had in the conventional sense any doubt of Mrs Hatchs
irreproachableness The ladys offences were always against taste rather
than conduct her divorce record seemed due to geographical rather than
ethical conditions and her worst laxities were likely to proceed from a
wandering and extravagant goodnature But if Lily did not mind her
detaining her manicure for luncheon or offering the BeautyDoctor a
seat in Freddy Van Osburghs box at the play she was not equally at ease
in regard to some less apparent lapses from convention Ned Silvertons
relation to Stancy seemed for instance closer and less clear than any
natural affinities would warrant and both appeared united in the effort
to cultivate Freddy Van Osburghs growing taste for Mrs Hatch There was
as yet nothing definable in the situation which might well resolve
itself into a huge joke on the part of the other two but Lily had a
vague sense that the subject of their experiment was too young too rich
and too credulous Her embarrassment was increased by the fact that
Freddy seemed to regard her as cooperating with himself in the social
development of Mrs Hatch a view that suggested on his part a
permanent interest in the ladys future There were moments when Lily
found an ironic amusement in this aspect of the case The thought of
launching such a missile as Mrs Hatch at the perfidious bosom of society
was not without its charm Miss Bart had even beguiled her leisure with
visions of the fair Norma introduced for the first time to a family
banquet at the Van Osburghs But the thought of being personally
connected with the transaction was less agreeable and her momentary
flashes of amusement were followed by increasing periods of doubt

The sense of these doubts was uppermost when late one afternoon she was
surprised by a visit from Lawrence Selden He found her alone in the
wilderness of pink damask for in Mrs Hatchs world the teahour was not
dedicated to social rites and the lady was in the hands of her masseuse

Seldens entrance had caused Lily an inward start of embarrassment but
his air of constraint had the effect of restoring her selfpossession
and she took at once the tone of surprise and pleasure wondering frankly
that he should have traced her to so unlikely a place and asking what
had inspired him to make the search

Selden met this with an unusual seriousness she had never seen him so
little master of the situation so plainly at the mercy of any
obstructions she might put in his way I wanted to see you he said
and she could not resist observing in reply that he had kept his wishes
under remarkable control She had in truth felt his long absence as one
of the chief bitternesses of the last months his desertion had wounded
sensibilities far below the surface of her pride

Selden met the challenge with directness Why should I have come unless
I thought I could be of use to you It is my only excuse for imagining
you could want me

This struck her as a clumsy evasion and the thought gave a flash of
keenness to her answer Then you have come now because you think you can
be of use to me

He hesitated again Yes in the modest capacity of a person to talk
things over with

For a clever man it was certainly a stupid beginning and the idea that
his awkwardness was due to the fear of her attaching a personal
significance to his visit chilled her pleasure in seeing him Even under
the most adverse conditions that pleasure always made itself felt she
might hate him but she had never been able to wish him out of the room
She was very near hating him now yet the sound of his voice the way the
light fell on his thin dark hair the way he sat and moved and wore his
clothesshe was conscious that even these trivial things were inwoven
with her deepest life In his presence a sudden stillness came upon her
and the turmoil of her spirit ceased but an impulse of resistance to
this stealing influence now prompted her to say Its very good of you
to present yourself in that capacity but what makes you think I have
anything particular to talk about

Though she kept the even tone of light intercourse the question was
framed in a way to remind him that his good offices were unsought and
for a moment Selden was checked by it The situation between them was one
which could have been cleared up only by a sudden explosion of feeling
and their whole training and habit of mind were against the chances of
such an explosion Seldens calmness seemed rather to harden into
resistance and Miss Barts into a surface of glittering irony as they
faced each other from the opposite corners of one of Mrs Hatchs
elephantine sofas The sofa in question and the apartment peopled by its
monstrous mates served at length to suggest the turn of Seldens reply

Gerty told me that you were acting as Mrs Hatchs secretary and I knew
she was anxious to hear how you were getting on

Miss Bart received this explanation without perceptible softening Why
didnt she look me up herself then she asked

Because as you didnt send her your address she was afraid of being
importunate Selden continued with a smile You see no such scruples
restrained me but then I havent as much to risk if I incur your
displeasure

Lily answered his smile You havent incurred it as yet but I have an
idea that you are going to

That rests with you doesnt it You see my initiative doesnt go beyond
putting myself at your disposal

But in what capacity What am I to do with you she asked in the same
light tone

Selden again glanced about Mrs Hatchs drawingroom then he said with
a decision which he seemed to have gathered from this final inspection
You are to let me take you away from here

Lily flushed at the suddenness of the attack then she stiffened under it
and said coldly And may I ask where you mean me to go

Back to Gerty in the first place if you will the essential thing is
that it should be away from here

The unusual harshness of his tone might have shown her how much the words
cost him but she was in no state to measure his feelings while her own
were in a flame of revolt To neglect her perhaps even to avoid her at
a time when she had most need of her friends and then suddenly and
unwarrantably to break into her life with this strange assumption of
authority was to rouse in her every instinct of pride and selfdefence

I am very much obliged to you she said for taking such an interest
in my plans but I am quite contented where I am and have no intention
of leaving

Selden had risen and was standing before her in an attitude of
uncontrollable expectancy

That simply means that you dont know where you are he exclaimed

Lily rose also with a quick flash of anger If you have come here to
say disagreeable things about Mrs Hatch

It is only with your relation to Mrs Hatch that I am concerned

My relation to Mrs Hatch is one I have no reason to be ashamed of She
has helped me to earn a living when my old friends were quite resigned to
seeing me starve

Nonsense Starvation is not the only alternative You know you can
always find a home with Gerty till you are independent again

You show such an intimate acquaintance with my affairs that I suppose
you meantill my aunts legacy is paid

I do mean that Gerty told me of it Selden acknowledged without
embarrassment He was too much in earnest now to feel any false
constraint in speaking his mind

But Gerty does not happen to know Miss Bart rejoined that I owe
every penny of that legacy

Good God Selden exclaimed startled out of his composure by the
abruptness of the statement

Every penny of it and more too Lily repeated and you now perhaps
see why I prefer to remain with Mrs Hatch rather than take advantage of
Gertys kindness I have no money left except my small income and I
must earn something more to keep myself alive

Selden hesitated a moment then he rejoined in a quieter tone But with
your income and Gertyssince you allow me to go so far into the details
of the situationyou and she could surely contrive a life together which
would put you beyond the need of having to support yourself Gerty I
know is eager to make such an arrangement and would be quite happy in
it

But I should not Miss Bart interposed There are many reasons why it
would be neither kind to Gerty nor wise for myself She paused a moment
and as he seemed to await a farther explanation added with a quick lift
of her head You will perhaps excuse me from giving you these reasons

I have no claim to know them Selden answered ignoring her tone no
claim to offer any comment or suggestion beyond the one I have already
made And my right to make that is simply the universal right of a man to
enlighten a woman when he sees her unconsciously placed in a false
position

Lily smiled I suppose she rejoined that by a false position you
mean one outside of what we call society but you must remember that I
had been excluded from those sacred precincts long before I met Mrs
Hatch As far as I can see there is very little real difference in being
inside or out and I remember your once telling me that it was only those
inside who took the difference seriously

She had not been without intention in making this allusion to their
memorable talk at Bellomont and she waited with an odd tremor of the
nerves to see what response it would bring but the result of the
experiment was disappointing Selden did not allow the allusion to
deflect him from his point he merely said with completer fulness of
emphasis The question of being inside or out is as you say a small
one and it happens to have nothing to do with the case except in so far
as Mrs Hatchs desire to be inside may put you in the position I call
false

In spite of the moderation of his tone each word he spoke had the effect
of confirming Lilys resistance The very apprehensions he aroused
hardened her against him she had been on the alert for the note of
personal sympathy for any sign of recovered power over him and his
attitude of sober impartiality the absence of all response to her
appeal turned her hurt pride to blind resentment of his interference
The conviction that he had been sent by Gerty and that whatever straits
he conceived her to be in he would never voluntarily have come to her
aid strengthened her resolve not to admit him a hairs breadth farther
into her confidence However doubtful she might feel her situation to be
she would rather persist in darkness than owe her enlightenment to Selden

I dont know she said when he had ceased to speak why you imagine
me to be situated as you describe but as you have always told me that
the sole object of a bringingup like mine was to teach a girl to get
what she wants why not assume that that is precisely what I am doing

The smile with which she summed up her case was like a clear barrier
raised against farther confidences its brightness held him at such a
distance that he had a sense of being almost out of hearing as he
rejoined I am not sure that I have ever called you a successful example
of that kind of bringingup

Her colour rose a little at the implication but she steeled herself with
a light laugh Ah wait a little longergive me a little more time
before you decide And as he wavered before her still watching for a
break in the impenetrable front she presented Dont give me up I may
still do credit to my training she affirmed



Chapter 10

Look at those spangles Miss Bartevery one of em sewed on crooked

The tall forewoman a pinched perpendicular figure dropped the condemned
structure of wire and net on the table at Lilys side and passed on to
the next figure in the line

There were twenty of them in the workroom their fagged profiles under
exaggerated hair bowed in the harsh north light above the utensils of
their art for it was something more than an industry surely this
creation of evervaried settings for the face of fortunate womanhood
Their own faces were sallow with the unwholesomeness of hot air and
sedentary toil rather than with any actual signs of want they were
employed in a fashionable millinery establishment and were fairly well
clothed and well paid but the youngest among them was as dull and
colourless as the middleaged In the whole workroom there was only one
skin beneath which the blood still visibly played and that now burned
with vexation as Miss Bart under the lash of the forewomans comment
began to strip the hatframe of its overlapping spangles

To Gerty Farishs hopeful spirit a solution appeared to have been reached
when she remembered how beautifully Lily could trim hats Instances of
young ladymilliners establishing themselves under fashionable patronage
and imparting to their creations that indefinable touch which the
professional hand can never give had flattered Gertys visions of the
future and convinced even Lily that her separation from Mrs Norma Hatch
need not reduce her to dependence on her friends

The parting had occurred a few weeks after Seldens visit and would have
taken place sooner had it not been for the resistance set up in Lily by
his illstarred offer of advice The sense of being involved in a
transaction she would not have cared to examine too closely had soon
afterward defined itself in the light of a hint from Mr Stancy that if
she saw them through she would have no reason to be sorry The
implication that such loyalty would meet with a direct reward had
hastened her flight and flung her back ashamed and penitent on the
broad bosom of Gertys sympathy She did not however propose to lie
there prone and Gertys inspiration about the hats at once revived her
hopes of profitable activity Here was after all something that her
charming listless hands could really do she had no doubt of their
capacity for knotting a ribbon or placing a flower to advantage And of
course only these finishing touches would be expected of her subordinate
fingers blunt grey needlepricked fingers would prepare the shapes
and stitch the linings while she presided over the charming little front
shopa shop all white panels mirrors and mossgreen hangingswhere
her finished creations hats wreaths aigrettes and the rest perched on
their stands like birds just poising for flight

But at the very outset of Gertys campaign this vision of the
greenandwhite shop had been dispelled Other young ladies of fashion
had been thus setup selling their hats by the mere attraction of a
name and the reputed knack of tying a bow but these privileged beings
could command a faith in their powers materially expressed by the
readiness to pay their shoprent and advance a handsome sum for current
expenses Where was Lily to find such support And even could it have
been found how were the ladies on whose approval she depended to be
induced to give her their patronage Gerty learned that whatever sympathy
her friends case might have excited a few months since had been
imperilled if not lost by her association with Mrs Hatch Once again
Lily had withdrawn from an ambiguous situation in time to save her
selfrespect but too late for public vindication Freddy Van Osburgh
was not to marry Mrs Hatch he had been rescued at the eleventh
hoursome said by the efforts of Gus Trenor and Rosedaleand despatched
to Europe with old Ned Van Alstyne but the risk he had run would always
be ascribed to Miss Barts connivance and would somehow serve as a
summingup and corroboration of the vague general distrust of her It was
a relief to those who had hung back from her to find themselves thus
justified and they were inclined to insist a little on her connection
with the Hatch case in order to show that they had been right

Gertys quest at any rate brought up against a solid wall of
resistance and even when Carry Fisher momentarily penitent for her
share in the Hatch affair joined her efforts to Miss Farishs they met
with no better success Gerty had tried to veil her failure in tender
ambiguities but Carry always the soul of candour put the case squarely
to her friend

I went straight to Judy Trenor she has fewer prejudices than the
others and besides shes always hated Bertha Dorset But what HAVE you
done to her Lily At the very first word about giving you a start she
flamed out about some money youd got from Gus I never knew her so hot
before You know shell let him do anything but spend money on his
friends the only reason shes decent to me now is that she knows Im not
hard upHe speculated for you you say Well whats the harm He had
no business to lose He DIDNT lose Then what on earthbut I never
COULD understand you Lily

The end of it was that after anxious enquiry and much deliberation Mrs
Fisher and Gerty for once oddly united in their effort to help their
friend decided on placing her in the workroom of Mme Reginas renowned
millinery establishment Even this arrangement was not effected without
considerable negotiation for Mme Regina had a strong prejudice against
untrained assistance and was induced to yield only by the fact that she
owed the patronage of Mrs Bry and Mrs Gormer to Carry Fishers
influence She had been willing from the first to employ Lily in the
showroom as a displayer of hats a fashionable beauty might be a
valuable asset But to this suggestion Miss Bart opposed a negative which
Gerty emphatically supported while Mrs Fisher inwardly unconvinced
but resigned to this latest proof of Lilys unreason agreed that perhaps
in the end it would be more useful that she should learn the trade To
Reginas workroom Lily was therefore committed by her friends and there
Mrs Fisher left her with a sigh of relief while Gertys watchfulness
continued to hover over her at a distance

Lily had taken up her work early in January it was now two months later
and she was still being rebuked for her inability to sew spangles on a
hatframe As she returned to her work she heard a titter pass down the
tables She knew she was an object of criticism and amusement to the
other workwomen They were of course aware of her historythe exact
situation of every girl in the room was known and freely discussed by all
the othersbut the knowledge did not produce in them any awkward sense
of class distinction it merely explained why her untutored fingers were
still blundering over the rudiments of the trade Lily had no desire
that they should recognize any social difference in her but she had
hoped to be received as their equal and perhaps before long to show
herself their superior by a special deftness of touch and it was
humiliating to find that after two months of drudgery she still
betrayed her lack of early training Remote was the day when she might
aspire to exercise the talents she felt confident of possessing only
experienced workers were entrusted with the delicate art of shaping and
trimming the hat and the forewoman still held her inexorably to the
routine of preparatory work

She began to rip the spangles from the frame listening absently to the
buzz of talk which rose and fell with the coming and going of Miss
Hainess active figure The air was closer than usual because Miss
Haines who had a cold had not allowed a window to be opened even during
the noon recess and Lilys head was so heavy with the weight of a
sleepless night that the chatter of her companions had the incoherence of
a dream

I TOLD her hed never look at her again and he didnt I wouldnt have
eitherI think she acted real mean to him He took her to the Arion
Ball and had a hack for her both ways Shes taken ten bottles and
her headaches dont seem no betterbut shes written a testimonial to
say the first bottle cured her and she got five dollars and her picture
in the paper Mrs Trenors hat The one with the green Paradise
Here Miss Hainesitll be ready right off That was one of the
Trenor girls here yesterday with Mrs George Dorset Howd I know Why
Madam sent for me to alter the flower in that Virot hatthe blue tulle
shes tall and slight with her hair fuzzed outa good deal like Mamie
Leach ony thinner

On and on it flowed a current of meaningless sound on which
startlingly enough a familiar name now and then floated to the surface
It was the strangest part of Lilys strange experience the hearing of
these names the seeing the fragmentary and distorted image of the world
she had lived in reflected in the mirror of the workinggirls minds She
had never before suspected the mixture of insatiable curiosity and
contemptuous freedom with which she and her kind were discussed in this
underworld of toilers who lived on their vanity and selfindulgence
Every girl in Mme Reginas workroom knew to whom the headgear in her
hands was destined and had her opinion of its future wearer and a
definite knowledge of the latters place in the social system That Lily
was a star fallen from that sky did not after the first stir of
curiosity had subsided materially add to their interest in her She had
fallen she had gone under and true to the ideal of their race they
were awed only by successby the gross tangible image of material
achievement The consciousness of her different point of view merely kept
them at a little distance from her as though she were a foreigner with
whom it was an effort to talk

Miss Bart if you cant sew those spangles on more regular I guess youd
better give the hat to Miss Kilroy

Lily looked down ruefully at her handiwork The forewoman was right the
sewing on of the spangles was inexcusably bad What made her so much more
clumsy than usual Was it a growing distaste for her task or actual
physical disability She felt tired and confused it was an effort to put
her thoughts together She rose and handed the hat to Miss Kilroy who
took it with a suppressed smile

Im sorry Im afraid I am not well she said to the forewoman

Miss Haines offered no comment From the first she had augured ill of
Mme Reginas consenting to include a fashionable apprentice among her
workers In that temple of art no raw beginners were wanted and Miss
Haines would have been more than human had she not taken a certain
pleasure in seeing her forebodings confirmed

Youd better go back to binding edges she said drily Lily slipped out
last among the band of liberated workwomen She did not care to be
mingled in their noisy dispersal once in the street she always felt an
irresistible return to her old standpoint an instinctive shrinking from
all that was unpolished and promiscuous In the dayshow distant they
now seemedwhen she had visited the Girls Club with Gerty Farish she
had felt an enlightened interest in the workingclasses but that was
because she looked down on them from above from the happy altitude of
her grace and her beneficence Now that she was on a level with them the
point of view was less interesting

She felt a touch on her arm and met the penitent eye of Miss Kilroy
Miss Bart I guess you can sew those spangles on as well as I can when
youre feeling right Miss Haines didnt act fair to you

Lilys colour rose at the unexpected advance it was a long time since
real kindness had looked at her from any eyes but Gertys

Oh thank you Im not particularly well but Miss Haines was right I
AM clumsy

Well its mean work for anybody with a headache Miss Kilroy paused
irresolutely You ought to go right home and lay down Ever try
orangeine

Thank you Lily held out her hand Its very kind of youI mean to go
home

She looked gratefully at Miss Kilroy but neither knew what more to say
Lily was aware that the other was on the point of offering to go home
with her but she wanted to be alone and silenteven kindness the sort
of kindness that Miss Kilroy could give would have jarred on her just
then

Thank you she repeated as she turned away

She struck westward through the dreary March twilight toward the street
where her boardinghouse stood She had resolutely refused Gertys offer
of hospitality Something of her mothers fierce shrinking from
observation and sympathy was beginning to develop in her and the
promiscuity of small quarters and close intimacy seemed on the whole
less endurable than the solitude of a hall bedroom in a house where she
could come and go unremarked among other workers For a while she had
been sustained by this desire for privacy and independence but now
perhaps from increasing physical weariness the lassitude brought about
by hours of unwonted confinement she was beginning to feel acutely the
ugliness and discomfort of her surroundings The days task done she
dreaded to return to her narrow room with its blotched wallpaper and
shabby paint and she hated every step of the walk thither through the
degradation of a New York street in the last stages of decline from
fashion to commerce

But what she dreaded most of all was having to pass the chemists at the
corner of Sixth Avenue She had meant to take another street she had
usually done so of late But today her steps were irresistibly drawn
toward the flaring plateglass corner she tried to take the lower
crossing but a laden dray crowded her back and she struck across the
street obliquely reaching the sidewalk just opposite the chemists door

Over the counter she caught the eye of the clerk who had waited on her
before and slipped the prescription into his hand There could be no
question about the prescription it was a copy of one of Mrs Hatchs
obligingly furnished by that ladys chemist Lily was confident that the
clerk would fill it without hesitation yet the nervous dread of a
refusal or even of an expression of doubt communicated itself to her
restless hands as she affected to examine the bottles of perfume stacked
on the glass case before her

The clerk had read the prescription without comment but in the act of
handing out the bottle he paused

You dont want to increase the dose you know he remarked Lilys
heart contracted

What did he mean by looking at her in that way

Of course not she murmured holding out her hand

Thats all right its a queeracting drug A drop or two more and off
you gothe doctors dont know why

The dread lest he should question her or keep the bottle back choked
the murmur of acquiescence in her throat and when at length she emerged
safely from the shop she was almost dizzy with the intensity of her
relief The mere touch of the packet thrilled her tired nerves with the
delicious promise of a night of sleep and in the reaction from her
momentary fear she felt as if the first fumes of drowsiness were already
stealing over her

In her confusion she stumbled against a man who was hurrying down the
last steps of the elevated station He drew back and she heard her name
uttered with surprise It was Rosedale furcoated glossy and
prosperousbut why did she seem to see him so far off and as if through
a mist of splintered crystals Before she could account for the
phenomenon she found herself shaking hands with him They had parted with
scorn on her side and anger upon his but all trace of these emotions
seemed to vanish as their hands met and she was only aware of a confused
wish that she might continue to hold fast to him

Why whats the matter Miss Lily Youre not well he exclaimed and
she forced her lips into a pallid smile of reassurance

Im a little tiredits nothing Stay with me a moment please she
faltered That she should be asking this service of Rosedale

He glanced at the dirty and unpropitious corner on which they stood with
the shriek of the elevated and the tumult of trams and waggons
contending hideously in their ears

We cant stay here but let me take you somewhere for a cup of tea The
LONGWORTH is only a few yards off and therell be no one there at this
hour

A cup of tea in quiet somewhere out of the noise and ugliness seemed
for the moment the one solace she could bear A few steps brought them to
the ladies door of the hotel he had named and a moment later he was
seated opposite to her and the waiter had placed the teatray between
them

Not a drop of brandy or whiskey first You look regularly done up Miss
Lily Well take your tea strong then and waiter get a cushion for
the ladys back

Lily smiled faintly at the injunction to take her tea strong It was the
temptation she was always struggling to resist Her craving for the keen
stimulant was forever conflicting with that other craving for sleepthe
midnight craving which only the little phial in her hand could still But
today at any rate the tea could hardly be too strong she counted on it
to pour warmth and resolution into her empty veins

As she leaned back before him her lids drooping in utter lassitude
though the first warm draught already tinged her face with returning
life Rosedale was seized afresh by the poignant surprise of her beauty
The dark pencilling of fatigue under her eyes the morbid blueveined
pallour of the temples brought out the brightness of her hair and lips
as though all her ebbing vitality were centred there Against the dull
chocolatecoloured background of the restaurant the purity of her head
stood out as it had never done in the most brightlylit ballroom He
looked at her with a startled uncomfortable feeling as though her beauty
were a forgotten enemy that had lain in ambush and now sprang out on him
unawares

To clear the air he tried to take an easy tone with her Why Miss Lily
I havent seen you for an age I didnt know what had become of you

As he spoke he was checked by an embarrassing sense of the complications
to which this might lead Though he had not seen her he had heard of her
he knew of her connection with Mrs Hatch and of the talk resulting from
it Mrs Hatchs MILIEU was one which he had once assiduously frequented
and now as devoutly shunned

Lily to whom the tea had restored her usual clearness of mind saw what
was in his thoughts and said with a slight smile You would not be
likely to know about me I have joined the working classes

He stared in genuine wonder You dont mean Why what on earth are
you doing

Learning to be a millinerat least TRYING to learn she hastily
qualified the statement

Rosedale suppressed a low whistle of surprise Come offyou aint
serious are you

Perfectly serious Im obliged to work for my living

But I understoodI thought you were with Norma Hatch

You heard I had gone to her as her secretary

Something of the kind I believe He leaned forward to refill her cup

Lily guessed the possibilities of embarrassment which the topic held for
him and raising her eyes to his she said suddenly I left her two
months ago

Rosedale continued to fumble awkwardly with the teapot and she felt
sure that he had heard what had been said of her But what was there that
Rosedale did not hear

Wasnt it a soft berth he enquired with an attempt at lightness

Too softone might have sunk in too deep Lily rested one arm on the
edge of the table and sat looking at him more intently than she had ever
looked before An uncontrollable impulse was urging her to put her case
to this man from whose curiosity she had always so fiercely defended
herself

You know Mrs Hatch I think Well perhaps you can understand that she
might make things too easy for one

Rosedale looked faintly puzzled and she remembered that allusiveness was
lost on him

It was no place for you anyhow he agreed so suffused and immersed in
the light of her full gaze that he found himself being drawn into strange
depths of intimacy He who had had to subsist on mere fugitive glances
looks winged in flight and swiftly lost under covert now found her eyes
settling on him with a brooding intensity that fairly dazzled him

I left Lily continued lest people should say I was helping Mrs
Hatch to marry Freddy Van Osburghwho is not in the least too good for
herand as they still continue to say it I see that I might as well
have stayed where I was

Oh Freddy Rosedale brushed aside the topic with an air of its
unimportance which gave a sense of the immense perspective he had
acquired Freddy dont countbut I knew YOU werent mixed up in that
It aint your style

Lily coloured slightly she could not conceal from herself that the words
gave her pleasure She would have liked to sit there drinking more tea
and continuing to talk of herself to Rosedale But the old habit of
observing the conventions reminded her that it was time to bring their
colloquy to an end and she made a faint motion to push back her chair

Rosedale stopped her with a protesting gesture Wait a minutedont go
yet sit quiet and rest a little longer You look thoroughly played out
And you havent told me He broke off conscious of going farther
than he had meant She saw the struggle and understood it understood
also the nature of the spell to which he yielded as with his eyes on her
face he began again abruptly What on earth did you mean by saying just
now that you were learning to be a milliner

Just what I said I am an apprentice at Reginas

Good LordYOU But what for I knew your aunt had turned you down Mrs
Fisher told me about it But I understood you got a legacy from her

I got ten thousand dollars but the legacy is not to be paid till next
summer

Well butlook here you could BORROW on it any time you wanted

She shook her head gravely No for I owe it already

Owe it The whole ten thousand

Every penny She paused and then continued abruptly with her eyes on
his face I think Gus Trenor spoke to you once about having made some
money for me in stocks

She waited and Rosedale congested with embarrassment muttered that he
remembered something of the kind

He made about nine thousand dollars Lily pursued in the same tone of
eager communicativeness At the time I understood that he was
speculating with my own money it was incredibly stupid of me but I knew
nothing of business Afterward I found out that he had NOT used my
moneythat what he said he had made for me he had really given me It
was meant in kindness of course but it was not the sort of obligation
one could remain under Unfortunately I had spent the money before I
discovered my mistake and so my legacy will have to go to pay it back
That is the reason why I am trying to learn a trade

She made the statement clearly deliberately with pauses between the
sentences so that each should have time to sink deeply into her hearers
mind She had a passionate desire that some one should know the truth
about this transaction and also that the rumour of her intention to
repay the money should reach Judy Trenors ears And it had suddenly
occurred to her that Rosedale who had surprised Trenors confidence was
the fitting person to receive and transmit her version of the facts She
had even felt a momentary exhilaration at the thought of thus relieving
herself of her detested secret but the sensation gradually faded in the
telling and as she ended her pallour was suffused with a deep blush of
misery

Rosedale continued to stare at her in wonder but the wonder took the
turn she had least expected

But see hereif thats the case it cleans you out altogether

He put it to her as if she had not grasped the consequences of her act
as if her incorrigible ignorance of business were about to precipitate
her into a fresh act of folly

Altogetheryes she calmly agreed

He sat silent his thick hands clasped on the table his little puzzled
eyes exploring the recesses of the deserted restaurant

See herethats fine he exclaimed abruptly

Lily rose from her seat with a deprecating laugh Oh noits merely a
bore she asserted gathering together the ends of her feather scarf

Rosedale remained seated too intent on his thoughts to notice her
movement Miss Lily if you want any backingI like pluck broke
from him disconnectedly

Thank you She held out her hand Your tea has given me a tremendous
backing I feel equal to anything now

Her gesture seemed to show a definite intention of dismissal but her
companion had tossed a bill to the waiter and was slipping his short
arms into his expensive overcoat

Wait a minuteyouve got to let me walk home with you he said

Lily uttered no protest and when he had paused to make sure of his
change they emerged from the hotel and crossed Sixth Avenue again As she
led the way westward past a long line of areas which through the
distortion of their paintless rails revealed with increasing candour the
DISJECTA MEMBRA of bygone dinners Lily felt that Rosedale was taking
contemptuous note of the neighbourhood and before the doorstep at which
she finally paused he looked up with an air of incredulous disgust

This isnt the place Some one told me you were living with Miss Farish

No I am boarding here I have lived too long on my friends

He continued to scan the blistered brown stone front the windows draped
with discoloured lace and the Pompeian decoration of the muddy
vestibule then he looked back at her face and said with a visible
effort Youll let me come and see you some day

She smiled recognizing the heroism of the offer to the point of being
frankly touched by it Thank youI shall be very glad she made
answer in the first sincere words she had ever spoken to him



That evening in her own room Miss Bartwho had fled early from the heavy
fumes of the basement dinnertablesat musing upon the impulse which had
led her to unbosom herself to Rosedale Beneath it she discovered an
increasing sense of lonelinessa dread of returning to the solitude of
her room while she could be anywhere else or in any company but her
own Circumstances of late had combined to cut her off more and more
from her few remaining friends On Carry Fishers part the withdrawal was
perhaps not quite involuntary Having made her final effort on Lilys
behalf and landed her safely in Mme Reginas workroom Mrs Fisher
seemed disposed to rest from her labours and Lily understanding the
reason could not condemn her Carry had in fact come dangerously near to
being involved in the episode of Mrs Norma Hatch and it had taken some
verbal ingenuity to extricate herself She frankly owned to having
brought Lily and Mrs Hatch together but then she did not know Mrs
Hatchshe had expressly warned Lily that she did not know Mrs
Hatchand besides she was not Lilys keeper and really the girl was
old enough to take care of herself Carry did not put her own case so
brutally but she allowed it to be thus put for her by her latest bosom
friend Mrs Jack Stepney Mrs Stepney trembling over the narrowness of
her only brothers escape but eager to vindicate Mrs Fisher at whose
house she could count on the jolly parties which had become a necessity
to her since marriage had emancipated her from the Van Osburgh point of
view

Lily understood the situation and could make allowances for it Carry
had been a good friend to her in difficult days and perhaps only a
friendship like Gertys could be proof against such an increasing strain
Gertys friendship did indeed hold fast yet Lily was beginning to avoid
her also For she could not go to Gertys without risk of meeting Selden
and to meet him now would be pure pain It was pain enough even to think
of him whether she considered him in the distinctness of her waking
thoughts or felt the obsession of his presence through the blur of her
tormented nights That was one of the reasons why she had turned again to
Mrs Hatchs prescription In the uneasy snatches of her natural dreams
he came to her sometimes in the old guise of fellowship and tenderness
and she would rise from the sweet delusion mocked and emptied of her
courage But in the sleep which the phial procured she sank far below
such halfwaking visitations sank into depths of dreamless annihilation
from which she woke each morning with an obliterated past

Gradually to be sure the stress of the old thoughts would return but
at least they did not importune her waking hour The drug gave her a
momentary illusion of complete renewal from which she drew strength to
take up her daily work The strength was more and more needed as the
perplexities of her future increased She knew that to Gerty and Mrs
Fisher she was only passing through a temporary period of probation
since they believed that the apprenticeship she was serving at Mme
Reginas would enable her when Mrs Penistons legacy was paid to
realize the vision of the greenandwhite shop with the fuller competence
acquired by her preliminary training But to Lily herself aware that the
legacy could not be put to such a use the preliminary training seemed a
wasted effort She understood clearly enough that even if she could ever
learn to compete with hands formed from childhood for their special work
the small pay she received would not be a sufficient addition to her
income to compensate her for such drudgery And the realization of this
fact brought her recurringly face to face with the temptation to use the
legacy in establishing her business Once installed and in command of
her own workwomen she believed she had sufficient tact and ability to
attract a fashionable CLIENTELE and if the business succeeded she could
gradually lay aside money enough to discharge her debt to Trenor But the
task might take years to accomplish even if she continued to stint
herself to the utmost and meanwhile her pride would be crushed under the
weight of an intolerable obligation

These were her superficial considerations but under them lurked the
secret dread that the obligation might not always remain intolerable
She knew she could not count on her continuity of purpose and what
really frightened her was the thought that she might gradually
accommodate herself to remaining indefinitely in Trenors debt as she
had accommodated herself to the part allotted her on the Sabrina and as
she had so nearly drifted into acquiescing with Stancys scheme for the
advancement of Mrs Hatch Her danger lay as she knew in her old
incurable dread of discomfort and poverty in the fear of that mounting
tide of dinginess against which her mother had so passionately warned
her And now a new vista of peril opened before her She understood that
Rosedale was ready to lend her money and the longing to take advantage
of his offer began to haunt her insidiously It was of course impossible
to accept a loan from Rosedale but proximate possibilities hovered
temptingly before her She was quite sure that he would come and see her
again and almost sure that if he did she could bring him to the point
of offering to marry her on the terms she had previously rejected Would
she still reject them if they were offered More and more with every
fresh mischance befalling her did the pursuing furies seem to take the
shape of Bertha Dorset and close at hand safely locked among her
papers lay the means of ending their pursuit The temptation which her
scorn of Rosedale had once enabled her to reject now insistently
returned upon her and how much strength was left her to oppose it

What little there was must at any rate be husbanded to the utmost she
could not trust herself again to the perils of a sleepless night
Through the long hours of silence the dark spirit of fatigue and
loneliness crouched upon her breast leaving her so drained of bodily
strength that her morning thoughts swam in a haze of weakness The only
hope of renewal lay in the little bottle at her bedside and how much
longer that hope would last she dared not conjecture



Chapter 11

Lily lingering for a moment on the corner looked out on the afternoon
spectacle of Fifth Avenue It was a day in late April and the sweetness
of spring was in the air It mitigated the ugliness of the long crowded
thoroughfare blurred the gaunt rooflines threw a mauve veil over the
discouraging perspective of the side streets and gave a touch of poetry
to the delicate haze of green that marked the entrance to the Park

As Lily stood there she recognized several familiar faces in the passing
carriages The season was over and its ruling forces had disbanded but
a few still lingered delaying their departure for Europe or passing
through town on their return from the South Among them was Mrs Van
Osburgh swaying majestically in her Cspring barouche with Mrs Percy
Gryce at her side and the new heir to the Gryce millions enthroned
before them on his nurses knees They were succeeded by Mrs Hatchs
electric victoria in which that lady reclined in the lonely splendour of
a spring toilet obviously designed for company and a moment or two later
came Judy Trenor accompanied by Lady Skiddaw who had come over for her
annual tarpon fishing and a dip into the street

This fleeting glimpse of her past served to emphasize the sense of
aimlessness with which Lily at length turned toward home She had nothing
to do for the rest of the day nor for the days to come for the season
was over in millinery as well as in society and a week earlier Mme
Regina had notified her that her services were no longer required Mme
Regina always reduced her staff on the first of May and Miss Barts
attendance had of late been so irregularshe had so often been unwell
and had done so little work when she camethat it was only as a favour
that her dismissal had hitherto been deferred

Lily did not question the justice of the decision She was conscious of
having been forgetful awkward and slow to learn It was bitter to
acknowledge her inferiority even to herself but the fact had been
brought home to her that as a breadwinner she could never compete with
professional ability Since she had been brought up to be ornamental
she could hardly blame herself for failing to serve any practical
purpose but the discovery put an end to her consoling sense of universal
efficiency

As she turned homeward her thoughts shrank in anticipation from the fact
that there would be nothing to get up for the next morning The luxury of
lying late in bed was a pleasure belonging to the life of ease it had no
part in the utilitarian existence of the boardinghouse She liked to
leave her room early and to return to it as late as possible and she
was walking slowly now in order to postpone the detested approach to her
doorstep

But the doorstep as she drew near it acquired a sudden interest from
the fact that it was occupiedand indeed filledby the conspicuous
figure of Mr Rosedale whose presence seemed to take on an added
amplitude from the meanness of his surroundings

The sight stirred Lily with an irresistible sense of triumph Rosedale
a day or two after their chance meeting had called to enquire if she had
recovered from her indisposition but since then she had not seen or
heard from him and his absence seemed to betoken a struggle to keep
away to let her pass once more out of his life If this were the case
his return showed that the struggle had been unsuccessful for Lily knew
he was not the man to waste his time in an ineffectual sentimental
dalliance He was too busy too practical and above all too much
preoccupied with his own advancement to indulge in such unprofitable
asides

In the peacockblue parlour with its bunches of dried pampas grass and
discoloured steel engravings of sentimental episodes he looked about him
with unconcealed disgust laying his hat distrustfully on the dusty
console adorned with a Rogers statuette

Lily sat down on one of the plush and rosewood sofas and he deposited
himself in a rockingchair draped with a starched antimacassar which
scraped unpleasantly against the pink fold of skin above his collar

My goodnessyou cant go on living here he exclaimed

Lily smiled at his tone I am not sure that I can but I have gone over
my expenses very carefully and I rather think I shall be able to manage
it

Be able to manage it Thats not what I meanits no place for you

Its what I mean for I have been out of work for the last week

Out of workout of work What a way for you to talk The idea of your
having to workits preposterous He brought out his sentences in short
violent jerks as though they were forced up from a deep inner crater of
indignation Its a farcea crazy farce he repeated his eyes fixed
on the long vista of the room reflected in the blotched glass between the
windows

Lily continued to meet his expostulations with a smile I dont know why
I should regard myself as an exception she began

Because you ARE thats why and your being in a place like this is a
damnable outrage I cant talk of it calmly

She had in truth never seen him so shaken out of his usual glibness and
there was something almost moving to her in his inarticulate struggle
with his emotions

He rose with a start which left the rockingchair quivering on its beam
ends and placed himself squarely before her

Look here Miss Lily Im going to Europe next week going over to Paris
and London for a couple of monthsand I cant leave you like this I
cant do it I know its none of my businessyouve let me understand
that often enough but things are worse with you now than they have been
before and you must see that youve got to accept help from somebody
You spoke to me the other day about some debt to Trenor I know what you
meanand I respect you for feeling as you do about it

A blush of surprise rose to Lilys pale face but before she could
interrupt him he had continued eagerly Well Ill lend you the money to
pay Trenor and I wontIsee here dont take me up till Ive
finished What I mean is itll be a plain business arrangement such as
one man would make with another Now what have you got to say against
that

Lilys blush deepened to a glow in which humiliation and gratitude were
mingled and both sentiments revealed themselves in the unexpected
gentleness of her reply

Only this that it is exactly what Gus Trenor proposed and that I can
never again be sure of understanding the plainest business arrangement
Then realizing that this answer contained a germ of injustice she
added even more kindly Not that I dont appreciate your kindnessthat
Im not grateful for it But a business arrangement between us would in
any case be impossible because I shall have no security to give when my
debt to Gus Trenor has been paid

Rosedale received this statement in silence he seemed to feel the note
of finality in her voice yet to be unable to accept it as closing the
question between them

In the silence Lily had a clear perception of what was passing through
his mind Whatever perplexity he felt as to the inexorableness of her
coursehowever little he penetrated its motiveshe saw that it
unmistakably tended to strengthen her hold over him It was as though the
sense in her of unexplained scruples and resistances had the same
attraction as the delicacy of feature the fastidiousness of manner
which gave her an external rarity an air of being impossible to match
As he advanced in social experience this uniqueness had acquired a
greater value for him as though he were a collector who had learned to
distinguish minor differences of design and quality in some longcoveted
object

Lily perceiving all this understood that he would marry her at once on
the sole condition of a reconciliation with Mrs Dorset and the
temptation was the less easy to put aside because little by little
circumstances were breaking down her dislike for Rosedale The dislike
indeed still subsisted but it was penetrated here and there by the
perception of mitigating qualities in him of a certain gross kindliness
a rather helpless fidelity of sentiment which seemed to be struggling
through the hard surface of his material ambitions

Reading his dismissal in her eyes he held out his hand with a gesture
which conveyed something of this inarticulate conflict

If youd only let me Id set you up over them allId put you where
you could wipe your feet on em he declared and it touched her oddly
to see that his new passion had not altered his old standard of values



Lily took no sleepingdrops that night She lay awake viewing her
situation in the crude light which Rosedales visit had shed on it In
fending off the offer he was so plainly ready to renew had she not
sacrificed to one of those abstract notions of honour that might be
called the conventionalities of the moral life What debt did she owe to
a social order which had condemned and banished her without trial She
had never been heard in her own defence she was innocent of the charge
on which she had been found guilty and the irregularity of her
conviction might seem to justify the use of methods as irregular in
recovering her lost rights Bertha Dorset to save herself had not
scrupled to ruin her by an open falsehood why should she hesitate to
make private use of the facts that chance had put in her way After all
half the opprobrium of such an act lies in the name attached to it Call
it blackmail and it becomes unthinkable but explain that it injures no
one and that the rights regained by it were unjustly forfeited and he
must be a formalist indeed who can find no plea in its defence

The arguments pleading for it with Lily were the old unanswerable ones of
the personal situation the sense of injury the sense of failure the
passionate craving for a fair chance against the selfish despotism of
society She had learned by experience that she had neither the aptitude
nor the moral constancy to remake her life on new lines to become a
worker among workers and let the world of luxury and pleasure sweep by
her unregarded She could not hold herself much to blame for this
ineffectiveness and she was perhaps less to blame than she believed
Inherited tendencies had combined with early training to make her the
highly specialized product she was an organism as helpless out of its
narrow range as the seaanemone torn from the rock She had been
fashioned to adorn and delight to what other end does nature round the
roseleaf and paint the hummingbirds breast And was it her fault that
the purely decorative mission is less easily and harmoniously fulfilled
among social beings than in the world of nature That it is apt to be
hampered by material necessities or complicated by moral scruples

These last were the two antagonistic forces which fought out their battle
in her breast during the long watches of the night and when she rose the
next morning she hardly knew where the victory lay She was exhausted by
the reaction of a night without sleep coming after many nights of rest
artificially obtained and in the distorting light of fatigue the future
stretched out before her grey interminable and desolate

She lay late in bed refusing the coffee and fried eggs which the
friendly Irish servant thrust through her door and hating the intimate
domestic noises of the house and the cries and rumblings of the street
Her week of idleness had brought home to her with exaggerated force these
small aggravations of the boardinghouse world and she yearned for that
other luxurious world whose machinery is so carefully concealed that one
scene flows into another without perceptible agency

At length she rose and dressed Since she had left Mme Reginas she had
spent her days in the streets partly to escape from the uncongenial
promiscuities of the boardinghouse and partly in the hope that physical
fatigue would help her to sleep But once out of the house she could not
decide where to go for she had avoided Gerty since her dismissal from
the milliners and she was not sure of a welcome anywhere else

The morning was in harsh contrast to the previous day A cold grey sky
threatened rain and a high wind drove the dust in wild spirals up and
down the streets Lily walked up Fifth Avenue toward the Park hoping to
find a sheltered nook where she might sit but the wind chilled her and
after an hours wandering under the tossing boughs she yielded to her
increasing weariness and took refuge in a little restaurant in
Fiftyninth Street She was not hungry and had meant to go without
luncheon but she was too tired to return home and the long perspective
of white tables showed alluringly through the windows

The room was full of women and girls all too much engaged in the rapid
absorption of tea and pie to remark her entrance A hum of shrill voices
reverberated against the low ceiling leaving Lily shut out in a little
circle of silence She felt a sudden pang of profound loneliness She had
lost the sense of time and it seemed to her as though she had not spoken
to any one for days Her eyes sought the faces about her craving a
responsive glance some sign of an intuition of her trouble But the
sallow preoccupied women with their bags and notebooks and rolls of
music were all engrossed in their own affairs and even those who sat by
themselves were busy running over proofsheets or devouring magazines
between their hurried gulps of tea Lily alone was stranded in a great
waste of disoccupation

She drank several cups of the tea which was served with her portion of
stewed oysters and her brain felt clearer and livelier when she emerged
once more into the street She realized now that as she sat in the
restaurant she had unconsciously arrived at a final decision The
discovery gave her an immediate illusion of activity it was exhilarating
to think that she had actually a reason for hurrying home To prolong
her enjoyment of the sensation she decided to walk but the distance was
so great that she found herself glancing nervously at the clocks on the
way One of the surprises of her unoccupied state was the discovery that
time when it is left to itself and no definite demands are made on it
cannot be trusted to move at any recognized pace Usually it loiters
but just when one has come to count upon its slowness it may suddenly
break into a wild irrational gallop

She found however on reaching home that the hour was still early
enough for her to sit down and rest a few minutes before putting her plan
into execution The delay did not perceptibly weaken her resolve She
was frightened and yet stimulated by the reserved force of resolution
which she felt within herself she saw it was going to be easier a great
deal easier than she had imagined

At five oclock she rose unlocked her trunk and took out a sealed
packet which she slipped into the bosom of her dress Even the contact
with the packet did not shake her nerves as she had halfexpected it
would She seemed encased in a strong armour of indifference as though
the vigorous exertion of her will had finally benumbed her finer
sensibilities

She dressed herself once more for the street locked her door and went
out When she emerged on the pavement the day was still high but a
threat of rain darkened the sky and cold gusts shook the signs projecting
from the basement shops along the street She reached Fifth Avenue and
began to walk slowly northward She was sufficiently familiar with Mrs
Dorsets habits to know that she could always be found at home after
five She might not indeed be accessible to visitors especially to a
visitor so unwelcome and against whom it was quite possible that she had
guarded herself by special orders but Lily had written a note which she
meant to send up with her name and which she thought would secure her
admission

She had allowed herself time to walk to Mrs Dorsets thinking that the
quick movement through the cold evening air would help to steady her
nerves but she really felt no need of being tranquillized Her survey of
the situation remained calm and unwavering

As she reached Fiftieth Street the clouds broke abruptly and a rush of
cold rain slanted into her face She had no umbrella and the moisture
quickly penetrated her thin spring dress She was still half a mile from
her destination and she decided to walk across to Madison Avenue and
take the electric car As she turned into the side street a vague memory
stirred in her The row of budding trees the new brick and limestone
housefronts the Georgian flathouse with flowerboxes on its balconies
were merged together into the setting of a familiar scene It was down
this street that she had walked with Selden that September day two years
ago a few yards ahead was the doorway they had entered together The
recollection loosened a throng of benumbed sensationslongings regrets
imaginings the throbbing brood of the only spring her heart had ever
known It was strange to find herself passing his house on such an
errand She seemed suddenly to see her action as he would see itand the
fact of his own connection with it the fact that to attain her end she
must trade on his name and profit by a secret of his past chilled her
blood with shame What a long way she had travelled since the day of
their first talk together Even then her feet had been set in the path
she was now followingeven then she had resisted the hand he had held
out

All her resentment of his fancied coldness was swept away in this
overwhelming rush of recollection Twice he had been ready to help
herto help her by loving her as he had saidand if the third time
he had seemed to fail her whom but herself could she accuse   
Well that part of her life was over she did not know why her thoughts
still clung to it But the sudden longing to see him remained it grew to
hunger as she paused on the pavement opposite his door The street was
dark and empty swept by the rain She had a vision of his quiet room of
the bookshelves and the fire on the hearth She looked up and saw a
light in his window then she crossed the street and entered the house



Chapter 12

The library looked as she had pictured it The greenshaded lamps made
tranquil circles of light in the gathering dusk a little fire flickered
on the hearth and Seldens easychair which stood near it had been
pushed aside when he rose to admit her

He had checked his first movement of surprise and stood silent waiting
for her to speak while she paused a moment on the threshold assailed by
a rush of memories

The scene was unchanged She recognized the row of shelves from which he
had taken down his La Bruyere and the worn arm of the chair he had
leaned against while she examined the precious volume But then the wide
September light had filled the room making it seem a part of the outer
world now the shaded lamps and the warm hearth detaching it from the
gathering darkness of the street gave it a sweeter touch of intimacy

Becoming gradually aware of the surprise under Seldens silence Lily
turned to him and said simply I came to tell you that I was sorry for
the way we partedfor what I said to you that day at Mrs Hatchs

The words rose to her lips spontaneously Even on her way up the stairs
she had not thought of preparing a pretext for her visit but she now
felt an intense longing to dispel the cloud of misunderstanding that hung
between them

Selden returned her look with a smile I was sorry too that we should
have parted in that way but I am not sure I didnt bring it on myself
Luckily I had foreseen the risk I was taking

So that you really didnt care broke from her with a flash of her
old irony

So that I was prepared for the consequences he corrected
goodhumouredly But well talk of all this later Do come and sit by
the fire I can recommend that armchair if youll let me put a cushion
behind you

While he spoke she had moved slowly to the middle of the room and paused
near his writingtable where the lamp striking upward cast exaggerated
shadows on the pallour of her delicatelyhollowed face

You look tireddo sit down he repeated gently

She did not seem to hear the request I wanted you to know that I left
Mrs Hatch immediately after I saw you she said as though continuing
her confession

Yesyes I know he assented with a rising tinge of embarrassment

And that I did so because you told me to Before you came I had already
begun to see that it would be impossible to remain with herfor the
reasons you gave me but I wouldnt admit itI wouldnt let you see that
I understood what you meant

Ah I might have trusted you to find your own way outdont overwhelm
me with the sense of my officiousness

His light tone in which had her nerves been steadier she would have
recognized the mere effort to bridge over an awkward moment jarred on
her passionate desire to be understood In her strange state of
extralucidity which gave her the sense of being already at the heart of
the situation it seemed incredible that any one should think it
necessary to linger in the conventional outskirts of wordplay and
evasion

It was not thatI was not ungrateful she insisted But the power of
expression failed her suddenly she felt a tremor in her throat and two
tears gathered and fell slowly from her eyes

Selden moved forward and took her hand You are very tired Why wont
you sit down and let me make you comfortable

He drew her to the armchair near the fire and placed a cushion behind
her shoulders

And now you must let me make you some tea you know I always have that
amount of hospitality at my command

She shook her head and two more tears ran over But she did not weep
easily and the long habit of selfcontrol reasserted itself though she
was still too tremulous to speak

You know I can coax the water to boil in five minutes Selden
continued speaking as though she were a troubled child

His words recalled the vision of that other afternoon when they had sat
together over his teatable and talked jestingly of her future There
were moments when that day seemed more remote than any other event in her
life and yet she could always relive it in its minutest detail

She made a gesture of refusal No I drink too much tea I would rather
sit quietI must go in a moment she added confusedly

Selden continued to stand near her leaning against the mantelpiece The
tinge of constraint was beginning to be more distinctly perceptible under
the friendly ease of his manner Her selfabsorption had not allowed her
to perceive it at first but now that her consciousness was once more
putting forth its eager feelers she saw that her presence was becoming
an embarrassment to him Such a situation can be saved only by an
immediate outrush of feeling and on Seldens side the determining
impulse was still lacking

The discovery did not disturb Lily as it might once have done She had
passed beyond the phase of wellbred reciprocity in which every
demonstration must be scrupulously proportioned to the emotion it
elicits and generosity of feeling is the only ostentation condemned
But the sense of loneliness returned with redoubled force as she saw
herself forever shut out from Seldens inmost self She had come to him
with no definite purpose the mere longing to see him had directed her
but the secret hope she had carried with her suddenly revealed itself in
its deathpang

I must go she repeated making a motion to rise from her chair But I
may not see you again for a long time and I wanted to tell you that I
have never forgotten the things you said to me at Bellomont and that
sometimessometimes when I seemed farthest from remembering themthey
have helped me and kept me from mistakes kept me from really becoming
what many people have thought me

Strive as she would to put some order in her thoughts the words would
not come more clearly yet she felt that she could not leave him without
trying to make him understand that she had saved herself whole from the
seeming ruin of her life

A change had come over Seldens face as she spoke Its guarded look had
yielded to an expression still untinged by personal emotion but full of
a gentle understanding

I am glad to have you tell me that but nothing I have said has really
made the difference The difference is in yourselfit will always be
there And since it IS there it cant really matter to you what people
think you are so sure that your friends will always understand you

Ah dont say thatdont say that what you have told me has made no
difference It seems to shut me outto leave me all alone with the other
people She had risen and stood before him once more completely
mastered by the inner urgency of the moment The consciousness of his
halfdivined reluctance had vanished Whether he wished it or not he
must see her wholly for once before they parted

Her voice had gathered strength and she looked him gravely in the eyes
as she continued Oncetwiceyou gave me the chance to escape from my
life and I refused it refused it because I was a coward Afterward I
saw my mistakeI saw I could never be happy with what had contented me
before But it was too late you had judged meI understood It was too
late for happinessbut not too late to be helped by the thought of what
I had missed That is all I have lived ondont take it from me now
Even in my worst moments it has been like a little light in the darkness
Some women are strong enough to be good by themselves but I needed the
help of your belief in me Perhaps I might have resisted a great
temptation but the little ones would have pulled me down And then I
rememberedI remembered your saying that such a life could never satisfy
me and I was ashamed to admit to myself that it could That is what you
did for methat is what I wanted to thank you for I wanted to tell you
that I have always remembered and that I have triedtried hard   

She broke off suddenly Her tears had risen again and in drawing out her
handkerchief her fingers touched the packet in the folds of her dress A
wave of colour suffused her and the words died on her lips Then she
lifted her eyes to his and went on in an altered voice

I have tried hardbut life is difficult and I am a very useless
person I can hardly be said to have an independent existence I was just
a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life and when I dropped
out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else What can one do when one
finds that one only fits into one hole One must get back to it or be
thrown out into the rubbish heapand you dont know what its like in
the rubbish heap

Her lips wavered into a smileshe had been distracted by the whimsical
remembrance of the confidences she had made to him two years earlier in
that very room Then she had been planning to marry Percy Grycewhat was
it she was planning now

The blood had risen strongly under Seldens dark skin but his emotion
showed itself only in an added seriousness of manner

You have something to tell medo you mean to marry he said abruptly

Lilys eyes did not falter but a look of wonder of puzzled
selfinterrogation formed itself slowly in their depths In the light of
his question she had paused to ask herself if her decision had really
been taken when she entered the room

You always told me I should have to come to it sooner or later she
said with a faint smile

And you have come to it now

I shall have to come to itpresently But there is something else I
must come to first She paused again trying to transmit to her voice
the steadiness of her recovered smile There is some one I must say
goodbye to Oh not YOUwe are sure to see each other againbut the
Lily Bart you knew I have kept her with me all this time but now we are
going to part and I have brought her back to youI am going to leave
her here When I go out presently she will not go with me I shall like
to think that she has stayed with youand shell be no trouble shell
take up no room

She went toward him and put out her hand still smiling Will you let
her stay with you she asked

He caught her hand and she felt in his the vibration of feeling that had
not yet risen to his lips Lilycant I help you he exclaimed

She looked at him gently Do you remember what you said to me once
That you could help me only by loving me Wellyou did love me for a
moment and it helped me It has always helped me But the moment is
goneit was I who let it go And one must go on living Goodbye

She laid her other hand on his and they looked at each other with a kind
of solemnity as though they stood in the presence of death Something
in truth lay dead between themthe love she had killed in him and could
no longer call to life But something lived between them also and leaped
up in her like an imperishable flame it was the love his love had
kindled the passion of her soul for his

In its light everything else dwindled and fell away from her She
understood now that she could not go forth and leave her old self with
him that self must indeed live on in his presence but it must still
continue to be hers

Selden had retained her hand and continued to scrutinize her with a
strange sense of foreboding The external aspect of the situation had
vanished for him as completely as for her he felt it only as one of
those rare moments which lift the veil from their faces as they pass

Lily he said in a low voice you mustnt speak in this way I cant
let you go without knowing what you mean to do Things may changebut
they dont pass You can never go out of my life

She met his eyes with an illumined look No she said I see that now
Let us always be friends Then I shall feel safe whatever happens

Whatever happens What do you mean What is going to happen

She turned away quietly and walked toward the hearth

Nothing at presentexcept that I am very cold and that before I go you
must make up the fire for me

She knelt on the hearthrug stretching her hands to the embers Puzzled
by the sudden change in her tone he mechanically gathered a handful of
wood from the basket and tossed it on the fire As he did so he noticed
how thin her hands looked against the rising light of the flames He saw
too under the loose lines of her dress how the curves of her figure had
shrunk to angularity he remembered long afterward how the red play of
the flame sharpened the depression of her nostrils and intensified the
blackness of the shadows which struck up from her cheekbones to her eyes
She knelt there for a few moments in silence a silence which he dared
not break When she rose he fancied that he saw her draw something from
her dress and drop it into the fire but he hardly noticed the gesture at
the time His faculties seemed tranced and he was still groping for the
word to break the spell She went up to him and laid her hands on his
shoulders Goodbye she said and as he bent over her she touched his
forehead with her lips



Chapter 13

The streetlamps were lit but the rain had ceased and there was a
momentary revival of light in the upper sky Lily walked on unconscious
of her surroundings She was still treading the buoyant ether which
emanates from the high moments of life But gradually it shrank away from
her and she felt the dull pavement beneath her feet The sense of
weariness returned with accumulated force and for a moment she felt that
she could walk no farther She had reached the corner of Fortyfirst
Street and Fifth Avenue and she remembered that in Bryant Park there
were seats where she might rest

That melancholy pleasureground was almost deserted when she entered it
and she sank down on an empty bench in the glare of an electric
streetlamp The warmth of the fire had passed out of her veins and she
told herself that she must not sit long in the penetrating dampness which
struck up from the wet asphalt But her willpower seemed to have spent
itself in a last great effort and she was lost in the blank reaction
which follows on an unwonted expenditure of energy And besides what was
there to go home to Nothing but the silence of her cheerless roomthat
silence of the night which may be more racking to tired nerves than the
most discordant noises that and the bottle of chloral by her bed The
thought of the chloral was the only spot of light in the dark prospect
she could feel its lulling influence stealing over her already But she
was troubled by the thought that it was losing its powershe dared not
go back to it too soon Of late the sleep it had brought her had been
more broken and less profound there had been nights when she was
perpetually floating up through it to consciousness What if the effect
of the drug should gradually fail as all narcotics were said to fail
She remembered the chemists warning against increasing the dose and she
had heard before of the capricious and incalculable action of the drug
Her dread of returning to a sleepless night was so great that she
lingered on hoping that excessive weariness would reinforce the waning
power of the chloral

Night had now closed in and the roar of traffic in Fortysecond Street
was dying out As complete darkness fell on the square the lingering
occupants of the benches rose and dispersed but now and then a stray
figure hurrying homeward struck across the path where Lily sat looming
black for a moment in the white circle of electric light One or two of
these passersby slackened their pace to glance curiously at her lonely
figure but she was hardly conscious of their scrutiny

Suddenly however she became aware that one of the passing shadows
remained stationary between her line of vision and the gleaming asphalt
and raising her eyes she saw a young woman bending over her

Excuse meare you sickWhy its Miss Bart a halffamiliar voice
exclaimed

Lily looked up The speaker was a poorlydressed young woman with a
bundle under her arm Her face had the air of unwholesome refinement
which illhealth and overwork may produce but its common prettiness was
redeemed by the strong and generous curve of the lips

You dont remember me she continued brightening with the pleasure of
recognition but Id know you anywhere Ive thought of you such a lot
I guess my folks all know your name by heart I was one of the girls at
Miss Farishs clubyou helped me to go to the country that time I had
lungtrouble My names Nettie Struther It was Nettie Crane thenbut I
daresay you dont remember that either

Yes Lily was beginning to remember The episode of Nettie Cranes timely
rescue from disease had been one of the most satisfying incidents of her
connection with Gertys charitable work She had furnished the girl with
the means to go to a sanatorium in the mountains it struck her now with
a peculiar irony that the money she had used had been Gus Trenors

She tried to reply to assure the speaker that she had not forgotten but
her voice failed in the effort and she felt herself sinking under a
great wave of physical weakness Nettie Struther with a startled
exclamation sat down and slipped a shabbilyclad arm behind her back

Why Miss Bart you ARE sick Just lean on me a little till you feel
better

A faint glow of returning strength seemed to pass into Lily from the
pressure of the supporting arm

Im only tiredit is nothing she found voice to say in a moment and
then as she met the timid appeal of her companions eyes she added
involuntarily I have been unhappyin great trouble

YOU in trouble Ive always thought of you as being so high up where
everything was just grand Sometimes when I felt real mean and got to
wondering why things were so queerly fixed in the world I used to
remember that you were having a lovely time anyhow and that seemed to
show there was a kind of justice somewhere But you mustnt sit here too
longits fearfully damp Dont you feel strong enough to walk on a
little ways now she broke off

Yesyes I must go home Lily murmured rising

Her eyes rested wonderingly on the thin shabby figure at her side She
had known Nettie Crane as one of the discouraged victims of overwork and
anaemic parentage one of the superfluous fragments of life destined to
be swept prematurely into that social refuseheap of which Lily had so
lately expressed her dread But Nettie Struthers frail envelope was now
alive with hope and energy whatever fate the future reserved for her
she would not be cast into the refuseheap without a struggle

I am very glad to have seen you Lily continued summoning a smile to
her unsteady lips Itll be my turn to think of you as happyand the
world will seem a less unjust place to me too

Oh but I cant leave you like thisyoure not fit to go home alone
And I cant go with you either Nettie Struther wailed with a start of
recollection You see its my husbands nightshifthes a
motormanand the friend I leave the baby with has to step upstairs to
get HER husbands supper at seven I didnt tell you I had a baby did I
Shell be four months old day after tomorrow and to look at her you
wouldnt think Id ever had a sick day Id give anything to show you the
baby Miss Bart and we live right down the street hereits only three
blocks off She lifted her eyes tentatively to Lilys face and then
added with a burst of courage Why wont you get right into the cars and
come home with me while I get babys supper Its real warm in our
kitchen and you can rest there and Ill take YOU home as soon as ever
she drops off to sleep

It WAS warm in the kitchen which when Nettie Struthers match had made
a flame leap from the gasjet above the table revealed itself to Lily as
extraordinarily small and almost miraculously clean A fire shone through
the polished flanks of the iron stove and near it stood a crib in which
a baby was sitting upright with incipient anxiety struggling for
expression on a countenance still placid with sleep

Having passionately celebrated her reunion with her offspring and
excused herself in cryptic language for the lateness of her return
Nettie restored the baby to the crib and shyly invited Miss Bart to the
rockingchair near the stove

Weve got a parlour too she explained with pardonable pride but I
guess its warmer in here and I dont want to leave you alone while Im
getting babys supper

On receiving Lilys assurance that she much preferred the friendly
proximity of the kitchen fire Mrs Struther proceeded to prepare a
bottle of infantile food which she tenderly applied to the babys
impatient lips and while the ensuing degustation went on she seated
herself with a beaming countenance beside her visitor

Youre sure you wont let me warm up a drop of coffee for you Miss
Bart Theres some of babys fresh milk left overwell maybe youd
rather just sit quiet and rest a little while Its too lovely having you
here Ive thought of it so often that I cant believe its really come
true Ive said to George again and again I just wish Miss Bart could
see me NOW and I used to watch for your name in the papers and wed
talk over what you were doing and read the descriptions of the dresses
you wore I havent seen your name for a long time though and I began
to be afraid you were sick and it worried me so that George said Id get
sick myself fretting about it Her lips broke into a reminiscent smile
Well I cant afford to be sick again thats a fact the last spell
nearly finished me When you sent me off that time I never thought Id
come back alive and I didnt much care if I did You see I didnt know
about George and the baby then

She paused to readjust the bottle to the childs bubbling mouth

You preciousdont you be in too much of a hurry Was it mad with
mommer for getting its supper so late Marry Antonettethats what we
call her after the French queen in that play at the GardenI told
George the actress reminded me of you and that made me fancy the
name    I never thought Id get married you know and Id never have
had the heart to go on working just for myself

She broke off again and meeting the encouragement in Lilys eyes went
on with a flush rising under her anaemic skin You see I wasnt only
just SICK that time you sent me offI was dreadfully unhappy too Id
known a gentleman where I was employedI dont know as you remember I
did typewriting in a big importing firmandwellI thought we were to
be married hed gone steady with me six months and given me his mothers
wedding ring But I presume he was too stylish for mehe travelled for
the firm and had seen a great deal of society Work girls arent looked
after the way you are and they dont always know how to look after
themselves I didnt    and it pretty near killed me when he went away
and left off writing   

It was then I came down sickI thought it was the end of everything I
guess it would have been if you hadnt sent me off But when I found I
was getting well I began to take heart in spite of myself And then
when I got back home George came round and asked me to marry him At
first I thought I couldnt because wed been brought up together and I
knew he knew about me But after a while I began to see that that made it
easier I never could have told another man and Id never have married
without telling but if George cared for me enough to have me as I was I
didnt see why I shouldnt begin over againand I did

The strength of the victory shone forth from her as she lifted her
irradiated face from the child on her knees But mercy I didnt mean
to go on like this about myself with you sitting there looking so fagged
out Only its so lovely having you here and letting you see just how
youve helped me The baby had sunk back blissfully replete and Mrs
Struther softly rose to lay the bottle aside Then she paused before Miss
Bart

I only wish I could help YOUbut I suppose theres nothing on earth I
could do she murmured wistfully

Lily instead of answering rose with a smile and held out her arms and
the mother understanding the gesture laid her child in them

The baby feeling herself detached from her habitual anchorage made an
instinctive motion of resistance but the soothing influences of
digestion prevailed and Lily felt the soft weight sink trustfully
against her breast The childs confidence in its safety thrilled her
with a sense of warmth and returning life and she bent over wondering
at the rosy blur of the little face the empty clearness of the eyes the
vague tendrilly motions of the folding and unfolding fingers At first
the burden in her arms seemed as light as a pink cloud or a heap of down
but as she continued to hold it the weight increased sinking deeper and
penetrating her with a strange sense of weakness as though the child
entered into her and became a part of herself

She looked up and saw Netties eyes resting on her with tenderness and
exultation

Wouldnt it be too lovely for anything if she could grow up to be just
like you Of course I know she never COULDbut mothers are always
dreaming the craziest things for their children

Lily clasped the child close for a moment and laid her back in her
mothers arms

Oh she must not do thatI should be afraid to come and see her too
often she said with a smile and then resisting Mrs Struthers
anxious offer of companionship and reiterating the promise that of
course she would come back soon and make Georges acquaintance and see
the baby in her bath she passed out of the kitchen and went alone down
the tenement stairs



As she reached the street she realized that she felt stronger and
happier the little episode had done her good It was the first time she
had ever come across the results of her spasmodic benevolence and the
surprised sense of human fellowship took the mortal chill from her heart

It was not till she entered her own door that she felt the reaction of a
deeper loneliness It was long after seven oclock and the light and
odours proceeding from the basement made it manifest that the
boardinghouse dinner had begun She hastened up to her room lit the
gas and began to dress She did not mean to pamper herself any longer
to go without food because her surroundings made it unpalatable Since it
was her fate to live in a boardinghouse she must learn to fall in with
the conditions of the life Nevertheless she was glad that when she
descended to the heat and glare of the diningroom the repast was nearly
over



In her own room again she was seized with a sudden fever of activity
For weeks past she had been too listless and indifferent to set her
possessions in order but now she began to examine systematically the
contents of her drawers and cupboard She had a few handsome dresses
leftsurvivals of her last phase of splendour on the Sabrina and in
Londonbut when she had been obliged to part with her maid she had given
the woman a generous share of her castoff apparel The remaining
dresses though they had lost their freshness still kept the long
unerring lines the sweep and amplitude of the great artists stroke and
as she spread them out on the bed the scenes in which they had been worn
rose vividly before her An association lurked in every fold each fall
of lace and gleam of embroidery was like a letter in the record of her
past She was startled to find how the atmosphere of her old life
enveloped her But after all it was the life she had been made for
every dawning tendency in her had been carefully directed toward it all
her interests and activities had been taught to centre around it She
was like some rare flower grown for exhibition a flower from which every
bud had been nipped except the crowning blossom of her beauty

Last of all she drew forth from the bottom of her trunk a heap of white
drapery which fell shapelessly across her arm It was the Reynolds dress
she had worn in the Bry TABLEAUX It had been impossible for her to give
it away but she had never seen it since that night and the long
flexible folds as she shook them out gave forth an odour of violets
which came to her like a breath from the floweredged fountain where she
had stood with Lawrence Selden and disowned her fate She put back the
dresses one by one laying away with each some gleam of light some note
of laughter some stray waft from the rosy shores of pleasure She was
still in a state of highlywrought impressionability and every hint of
the past sent a lingering tremor along her nerves

She had just closed her trunk on the white folds of the Reynolds dress
when she heard a tap at her door and the red fist of the Irish
maidservant thrust in a belated letter Carrying it to the light Lily
read with surprise the address stamped on the upper corner of the
envelope It was a business communication from the office of her aunts
executors and she wondered what unexpected development had caused them
to break silence before the appointed time She opened the envelope and a
cheque fluttered to the floor As she stooped to pick it up the blood
rushed to her face The cheque represented the full amount of Mrs
Penistons legacy and the letter accompanying it explained that the
executors having adjusted the business of the estate with less delay
than they had expected had decided to anticipate the date fixed for the
payment of the bequests

Lily sat down beside the desk at the foot of her bed and spreading out
the cheque read over and over the TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS written across it
in a steely business hand Ten months earlier the amount it stood for had
represented the depths of penury but her standard of values had changed
in the interval and now visions of wealth lurked in every flourish of
the pen As she continued to gaze at it she felt the glitter of the
visions mounting to her brain and after a while she lifted the lid of
the desk and slipped the magic formula out of sight It was easier to
think without those five figures dancing before her eyes and she had a
great deal of thinking to do before she slept

She opened her chequebook and plunged into such anxious calculations as
had prolonged her vigil at Bellomont on the night when she had decided to
marry Percy Gryce Poverty simplifies bookkeeping and her financial
situation was easier to ascertain than it had been then but she had not
yet learned the control of money and during her transient phase of
luxury at the Emporium she had slipped back into habits of extravagance
which still impaired her slender balance A careful examination of her
chequebook and of the unpaid bills in her desk showed that when the
latter had been settled she would have barely enough to live on for the
next three or four months and even after that if she were to continue
her present way of living without earning any additional money all
incidental expenses must be reduced to the vanishing point She hid her
eyes with a shudder beholding herself at the entrance of that
evernarrowing perspective down which she had seen Miss Silvertons dowdy
figure take its despondent way

It was no longer however from the vision of material poverty that she
turned with the greatest shrinking She had a sense of deeper
empoverishmentof an inner destitution compared to which outward
conditions dwindled into insignificance It was indeed miserable to be
poorto look forward to a shabby anxious middleage leading by dreary
degrees of economy and selfdenial to gradual absorption in the dingy
communal existence of the boardinghouse But there was something more
miserable stillit was the clutch of solitude at her heart the sense of
being swept like a stray uprooted growth down the heedless current of the
years That was the feeling which possessed her nowthe feeling of being
something rootless and ephemeral mere spindrift of the whirling surface
of existence without anything to which the poor little tentacles of self
could cling before the awful flood submerged them And as she looked back
she saw that there had never been a time when she had had any real
relation to life Her parents too had been rootless blown hither and
thither on every wind of fashion without any personal existence to
shelter them from its shifting gusts She herself had grown up without
any one spot of earth being dearer to her than another there was no
centre of early pieties of grave endearing traditions to which her
heart could revert and from which it could draw strength for itself and
tenderness for others In whatever form a slowlyaccumulated past lives
in the bloodwhether in the concrete image of the old house stored with
visual memories or in the conception of the house not built with hands
but made up of inherited passions and loyaltiesit has the same power of
broadening and deepening the individual existence of attaching it by
mysterious links of kinship to all the mighty sum of human striving

Such a vision of the solidarity of life had never before come to Lily
She had had a premonition of it in the blind motions of her
matinginstinct but they had been checked by the disintegrating
influences of the life about her All the men and women she knew were
like atoms whirling away from each other in some wild centrifugal dance
her first glimpse of the continuity of life had come to her that evening
in Nettie Struthers kitchen

The poor little workinggirl who had found strength to gather up the
fragments of her life and build herself a shelter with them seemed to
Lily to have reached the central truth of existence It was a meagre
enough life on the grim edge of poverty with scant margin for
possibilities of sickness or mischance but it had the frail audacious
permanence of a birds nest built on the edge of a cliffa mere wisp of
leaves and straw yet so put together that the lives entrusted to it may
hang safely over the abyss

Yesbut it had taken two to build the nest the mans faith as well as
the womans courage Lily remembered Netties words I KNEW HE KNEW ABOUT
ME Her husbands faith in her had made her renewal possibleit is so
easy for a woman to become what the man she loves believes her to be
WellSelden had twice been ready to stake his faith on Lily Bart but
the third trial had been too severe for his endurance The very quality
of his love had made it the more impossible to recall to life If it had
been a simple instinct of the blood the power of her beauty might have
revived it But the fact that it struck deeper that it was inextricably
wound up with inherited habits of thought and feeling made it as
impossible to restore to growth as a deeprooted plant torn from its bed
Selden had given her of his best but he was as incapable as herself of
an uncritical return to former states of feeling

There remained to her as she had told him the uplifting memory of his
faith in her but she had not reached the age when a woman can live on
her memories As she held Nettie Struthers child in her arms the frozen
currents of youth had loosed themselves and run warm in her veins the
old lifehunger possessed her and all her being clamoured for its share
of personal happiness Yesit was happiness she still wanted and the
glimpse she had caught of it made everything else of no account One by
one she had detached herself from the baser possibilities and she saw
that nothing now remained to her but the emptiness of renunciation

It was growing late and an immense weariness once more possessed her
It was not the stealing sense of sleep but a vivid wakeful fatigue a
wan lucidity of mind against which all the possibilities of the future
were shadowed forth gigantically She was appalled by the intense
cleanness of the vision she seemed to have broken through the merciful
veil which intervenes between intention and action and to see exactly
what she would do in all the long days to come There was the cheque in
her desk for instanceshe meant to use it in paying her debt to Trenor
but she foresaw that when the morning came she would put off doing so
would slip into gradual tolerance of the debt The thought terrified
hershe dreaded to fall from the height of her last moment with Lawrence
Selden But how could she trust herself to keep her footing She knew the
strength of the opposing impulsesshe could feel the countless hands of
habit dragging her back into some fresh compromise with fate She felt an
intense longing to prolong to perpetuate the momentary exaltation of
her spirit If only life could end nowend on this tragic yet sweet
vision of lost possibilities which gave her a sense of kinship with all
the loving and foregoing in the world

She reached out suddenly and drawing the cheque from her writingdesk
enclosed it in an envelope which she addressed to her bank She then
wrote out a cheque for Trenor and placing it without an accompanying
word in an envelope inscribed with his name laid the two letters side
by side on her desk After that she continued to sit at the table
sorting her papers and writing till the intense silence of the house
reminded her of the lateness of the hour In the street the noise of
wheels had ceased and the rumble of the elevated came only at long
intervals through the deep unnatural hush In the mysterious nocturnal
separation from all outward signs of life she felt herself more
strangely confronted with her fate The sensation made her brain reel
and she tried to shut out consciousness by pressing her hands against her
eyes But the terrible silence and emptiness seemed to symbolize her
futureshe felt as though the house the street the world were all
empty and she alone left sentient in a lifeless universe

But this was the verge of delirium    she had never hung so near the
dizzy brink of the unreal Sleep was what she wantedshe remembered that
she had not closed her eyes for two nights The little bottle was at her
bedside waiting to lay its spell upon her She rose and undressed
hastily hungering now for the touch of her pillow She felt so
profoundly tired that she thought she must fall asleep at once but as
soon as she had lain down every nerve started once more into separate
wakefulness It was as though a great blaze of electric light had been
turned on in her head and her poor little anguished self shrank and
cowered in it without knowing where to take refuge

She had not imagined that such a multiplication of wakefulness was
possible her whole past was reenacting itself at a hundred different
points of consciousness Where was the drug that could still this legion
of insurgent nerves The sense of exhaustion would have been sweet
compared to this shrill beat of activities but weariness had dropped
from her as though some cruel stimulant had been forced into her veins

She could bear ityes she could bear it but what strength would be
left her the next day Perspective had disappearedthe next day pressed
close upon her and on its heels came the days that were to followthey
swarmed about her like a shrieking mob She must shut them out for a few
hours she must take a brief bath of oblivion She put out her hand and
measured the soothing drops into a glass but as she did so she knew
they would be powerless against the supernatural lucidity of her brain
She had long since raised the dose to its highest limit but tonight she
felt she must increase it She knew she took a slight risk in doing
soshe remembered the chemists warning If sleep came at all it might
be a sleep without waking But after all that was but one chance in a
hundred the action of the drug was incalculable and the addition of a
few drops to the regular dose would probably do no more than procure for
her the rest she so desperately needed

She did not in truth consider the question very closelythe physical
craving for sleep was her only sustained sensation Her mind shrank from
the glare of thought as instinctively as eyes contract in a blaze of
lightdarkness darkness was what she must have at any cost She raised
herself in bed and swallowed the contents of the glass then she blew out
her candle and lay down

She lay very still waiting with a sensuous pleasure for the first
effects of the soporific She knew in advance what form they would
takethe gradual cessation of the inner throb the soft approach of
passiveness as though an invisible hand made magic passes over her in
the darkness The very slowness and hesitancy of the effect increased its
fascination it was delicious to lean over and look down into the dim
abysses of unconsciousness Tonight the drug seemed to work more slowly
than usual each passionate pulse had to be stilled in turn and it was
long before she felt them dropping into abeyance like sentinels falling
asleep at their posts But gradually the sense of complete subjugation
came over her and she wondered languidly what had made her feel so
uneasy and excited She saw now that there was nothing to be excited
aboutshe had returned to her normal view of life Tomorrow would not be
so difficult after all she felt sure that she would have the strength to
meet it She did not quite remember what it was that she had been afraid
to meet but the uncertainty no longer troubled her She had been
unhappy and now she was happyshe had felt herself alone and now the
sense of loneliness had vanished

She stirred once and turned on her side and as she did so she suddenly
understood why she did not feel herself alone It was oddbut Nettie
Struthers child was lying on her arm she felt the pressure of its
little head against her shoulder She did not know how it had come there
but she felt no great surprise at the fact only a gentle penetrating
thrill of warmth and pleasure She settled herself into an easier
position hollowing her arm to pillow the round downy head and holding
her breath lest a sound should disturb the sleeping child

As she lay there she said to herself that there was something she must
tell Selden some word she had found that should make life clear between
them She tried to repeat the word which lingered vague and luminous on
the far edge of thoughtshe was afraid of not remembering it when she
woke and if she could only remember it and say it to him she felt that
everything would be well

Slowly the thought of the word faded and sleep began to enfold her She
struggled faintly against it feeling that she ought to keep awake on
account of the baby but even this feeling was gradually lost in an
indistinct sense of drowsy peace through which of a sudden a dark
flash of loneliness and terror tore its way

She started up again cold and trembling with the shock for a moment she
seemed to have lost her hold of the child But noshe was mistakenthe
tender pressure of its body was still close to hers the recovered warmth
flowed through her once more she yielded to it sank into it and slept



Chapter 14

The next morning rose mild and bright with a promise of summer in the
air The sunlight slanted joyously down Lilys street mellowed the
blistered housefront gilded the paintless railings of the doorstep
and struck prismatic glories from the panes of her darkened window

When such a day coincides with the inner mood there is intoxication in
its breath and Selden hastening along the street through the squalor of
its morning confidences felt himself thrilling with a youthful sense of
adventure He had cut loose from the familiar shores of habit and
launched himself on uncharted seas of emotion all the old tests and
measures were left behind and his course was to be shaped by new stars

That course for the moment led merely to Miss Barts boardinghouse
but its shabby doorstep had suddenly become the threshold of the
untried As he approached he looked up at the triple row of windows
wondering boyishly which one of them was hers It was nine oclock and
the house being tenanted by workers already showed an awakened front to
the street He remembered afterward having noticed that only one blind
was down He noticed too that there was a pot of pansies on one of the
window sills and at once concluded that the window must be hers it was
inevitable that he should connect her with the one touch of beauty in the
dingy scene

Nine oclock was an early hour for a visit but Selden had passed beyond
all such conventional observances He only knew that he must see Lily
Bart at oncehe had found the word he meant to say to her and it could
not wait another moment to be said It was strange that it had not come
to his lips soonerthat he had let her pass from him the evening before
without being able to speak it But what did that matter now that a new
day had come It was not a word for twilight but for the morning

Selden ran eagerly up the steps and pulled the bell and even in his
state of selfabsorption it came as a sharp surprise to him that the door
should open so promptly It was still more of a surprise to see as he
entered that it had been opened by Gerty Farishand that behind her in
an agitated blur several other figures ominously loomed

Lawrence Gerty cried in a strange voice how could you get here so
quicklyand the trembling hand she laid on him seemed instantly to
close about his heart

He noticed the other faces vague with fear and conjecturehe saw the
landladys imposing bulk sway professionally toward him but he shrank
back putting up his hand while his eyes mechanically mounted the steep
black walnut stairs up which he was immediately aware that his cousin
was about to lead him

A voice in the background said that the doctor might be back at any
minuteand that nothing upstairs was to be disturbed Some one else
exclaimed It was the greatest mercy then Selden felt that Gerty had
taken him gently by the hand and that they were to be suffered to go up
alone

In silence they mounted the three flights and walked along the passage
to a closed door Gerty opened the door and Selden went in after her
Though the blind was down the irresistible sunlight poured a tempered
golden flood into the room and in its light Selden saw a narrow bed
along the wall and on the bed with motionless hands and calm
unrecognizing face the semblance of Lily Bart

That it was her real self every pulse in him ardently denied Her real
self had lain warm on his heart but a few hours earlierwhat had he to
do with this estranged and tranquil face which for the first time
neither paled nor brightened at his coming

Gerty strangely tranquil too with the conscious selfcontrol of one who
has ministered to much pain stood by the bed speaking gently as if
transmitting a final message

The doctor found a bottle of chloralshe had been sleeping badly for a
long time and she must have taken an overdose by mistake There is no
doubt of thatno doubtthere will be no questionhe has been very
kind I told him that you and I would like to be left alone with herto
go over her things before any one else comes I know it is what she would
have wished

Selden was hardly conscious of what she said He stood looking down on
the sleeping face which seemed to lie like a delicate impalpable mask
over the living lineaments he had known He felt that the real Lily was
still there close to him yet invisible and inaccessible and the
tenuity of the barrier between them mocked him with a sense of
helplessness There had never been more than a little impalpable barrier
between themand yet he had suffered it to keep them apart And now
though it seemed slighter and frailer than ever it had suddenly hardened
to adamant and he might beat his life out against it in vain

He had dropped on his knees beside the bed but a touch from Gerty
aroused him He stood up and as their eyes met he was struck by the
extraordinary light in his cousins face

You understand what the doctor has gone for He has promised that there
shall be no troublebut of course the formalities must be gone through
And I asked him to give us time to look through her things first

He nodded and she glanced about the small bare room It wont take
long she concluded

Noit wont take long he agreed

She held his hand in hers a moment longer and then with a last look at
the bed moved silently toward the door On the threshold she paused to
add You will find me downstairs if you want me

Selden roused himself to detain her But why are you going She would
have wished

Gerty shook her head with a smile No this is what she would have
wished and as she spoke a light broke through Seldens stony misery
and he saw deep into the hidden things of love

The door closed on Gerty and he stood alone with the motionless sleeper
on the bed His impulse was to return to her side to fall on his knees
and rest his throbbing head against the peaceful cheek on the pillow
They had never been at peace together they two and now he felt himself
drawn downward into the strange mysterious depths of her tranquillity

But he remembered Gertys warning wordshe knew that though time had
ceased in this room its feet were hastening relentlessly toward the
door Gerty had given him this supreme halfhour and he must use it as
she willed

He turned and looked about him sternly compelling himself to regain his
consciousness of outward things There was very little furniture in the
room The shabby chest of drawers was spread with a lace cover and set
out with a few goldtopped boxes and bottles a rosecoloured
pincushion a glass tray strewn with tortoiseshell hairpinshe shrank
from the poignant intimacy of these trifles and from the blank surface
of the toiletmirror above them

These were the only traces of luxury of that clinging to the minute
observance of personal seemliness which showed what her other
renunciations must have cost There was no other token of her personality
about the room unless it showed itself in the scrupulous neatness of the
scant articles of furniture a washingstand two chairs a small
writingdesk and the little table near the bed On this table stood the
empty bottle and glass and from these also he averted his eyes

The desk was closed but on its slanting lid lay two letters which he
took up One bore the address of a bank and as it was stamped and
sealed Selden after a moments hesitation laid it aside On the other
letter he read Gus Trenors name and the flap of the envelope was still
ungummed

Temptation leapt on him like the stab of a knife He staggered under it
steadying himself against the desk Why had she been writing to
Trenorwriting presumably just after their parting of the previous
evening The thought unhallowed the memory of that last hour made a mock
of the word he had come to speak and defiled even the reconciling
silence upon which it fell He felt himself flung back on all the ugly
uncertainties from which he thought he had cast loose forever After all
what did he know of her life Only as much as she had chosen to show him
and measured by the worlds estimate how little that was By what
rightthe letter in his hand seemed to askby what right was it he who
now passed into her confidence through the gate which death had left
unbarred His heart cried out that it was by right of their last hour
together the hour when she herself had placed the key in his hand
Yesbut what if the letter to Trenor had been written afterward

He put it from him with sudden loathing and setting his lips addressed
himself resolutely to what remained of his task After all that task
would be easier to perform now that his personal stake in it was
annulled

He raised the lid of the desk and saw within it a chequebook and a few
packets of bills and letters arranged with the orderly precision which
characterized all her personal habits He looked through the letters
first because it was the most difficult part of the work They proved to
be few and unimportant but among them he found with a strange commotion
of the heart the note he had written her the day after the Brys
entertainment

When may I come to youhis words overwhelmed him with a realization
of the cowardice which had driven him from her at the very moment of
attainment Yeshe had always feared his fate and he was too honest to
disown his cowardice now for had not all his old doubts started to life
again at the mere sight of Trenors name

He laid the note in his cardcase folding it away carefully as
something made precious by the fact that she had held it so then
growing once more aware of the lapse of time he continued his
examination of the papers

To his surprise he found that all the bills were receipted there was
not an unpaid account among them He opened the chequebook and saw
that the very night before a cheque of ten thousand dollars from Mrs
Penistons executors had been entered in it The legacy then had been
paid sooner than Gerty had led him to expect But turning another page
or two he discovered with astonishment that in spite of this recent
accession of funds the balance had already declined to a few dollars A
rapid glance at the stubs of the last cheques all of which bore the date
of the previous day showed that between four or five hundred dollars of
the legacy had been spent in the settlement of bills while the remaining
thousands were comprehended in one cheque made out at the same time to
Charles Augustus Trenor

Selden laid the book aside and sank into the chair beside the desk He
leaned his elbows on it and hid his face in his hands The bitter waters
of life surged high about him their sterile taste was on his lips Did
the cheque to Trenor explain the mystery or deepen it At first his mind
refused to acthe felt only the taint of such a transaction between a
man like Trenor and a girl like Lily Bart Then gradually his troubled
vision cleared old hints and rumours came back to him and out of the
very insinuations he had feared to probe he constructed an explanation
of the mystery It was true then that she had taken money from Trenor
but true also as the contents of the little desk declared that the
obligation had been intolerable to her and that at the first opportunity
she had freed herself from it though the act left her face to face with
bare unmitigated poverty

That was all he knewall he could hope to unravel of the story The
mute lips on the pillow refused him more than thisunless indeed they
had told him the rest in the kiss they had left upon his forehead Yes
he could now read into that farewell all that his heart craved to find
there he could even draw from it courage not to accuse himself for
having failed to reach the height of his opportunity

He saw that all the conditions of life had conspired to keep them apart
since his very detachment from the external influences which swayed her
had increased his spiritual fastidiousness and made it more difficult
for him to live and love uncritically But at least he HAD loved herhad
been willing to stake his future on his faith in herand if the moment
had been fated to pass from them before they could seize it he saw now
that for both it had been saved whole out of the ruin of their lives

It was this moment of love this fleeting victory over themselves which
had kept them from atrophy and extinction which in her had reached out
to him in every struggle against the influence of her surroundings and
in him had kept alive the faith that now drew him penitent and
reconciled to her side

He knelt by the bed and bent over her draining their last moment to its
lees and in the silence there passed between them the word which made
all clear

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

assistance they need is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms

remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
