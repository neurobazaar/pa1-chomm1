TO YOU




Blue Wednesday

The first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful Daya day to
be awaited with dread endured with courage and forgotten with haste
Every floor must be spotless every chair dustless and every bed
without a wrinkle Ninetyseven squirming little orphans must be
scrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams and
all ninetyseven reminded of their manners and told to say Yes
sir No sir whenever a Trustee spoke

It was a distressing time and poor Jerusha Abbott being the oldest
orphan had to bear the brunt of it But this particular first
Wednesday like its predecessors finally dragged itself to a close
Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches
for the asylums guests and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular
work Her special care was room F where eleven little tots from four
to seven occupied eleven little cots set in a row Jerusha assembled
her charges straightened their rumpled frocks wiped their noses and
started them in an orderly and willing line towards the diningroom to
engage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune
pudding

Then she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples
against the cool glass She had been on her feet since five that
morning doing everybodys bidding scolded and hurried by a nervous
matron Mrs Lippett behind the scenes did not always maintain that
calm and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees
and lady visitors Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of frozen
lawn beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines of the
asylum down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates to the
spires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees

The day was endedquite successfully so far as she knew The
Trustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds and read
their reports and drunk their tea and now were hurrying home to their
own cheerful firesides to forget their bothersome little charges for
another month Jerusha leaned forward watching with curiosityand a
touch of wistfulnessthe stream of carriages and automobiles that
rolled out of the asylum gates In imagination she followed first one
equipage then another to the big houses dotted along the hillside
She pictured herself in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with
feathers leaning back in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring Home to
the driver But on the doorsill of her home the picture grew blurred

Jerusha had an imaginationan imagination Mrs Lippett told her that
would get her into trouble if she didnt take carebut keen as it was
it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the houses she would
enter Poor eager adventurous little Jerusha in all her seventeen
years had never stepped inside an ordinary house she could not
picture the daily routine of those other human beings who carried on
their lives undiscommoded by orphans

 Jerusha Abbott
 You are wanted
 In the office
 And I think youd
 Better hurry up


Tommy Dillon who had joined the choir came singing up the stairs and
down the corridor his chant growing louder as he approached room F
Jerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced the troubles of
life

Who wants me she cut into Tommys chant with a note of sharp anxiety

 Mrs Lippett in the office
 And I think shes mad
 Ahamen


Tommy piously intoned but his accent was not entirely malicious Even
the most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring sister who
was summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron and Tommy liked
Jerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm and nearly scrub
his nose off

Jerusha went without comment but with two parallel lines on her brow
What could have gone wrong she wondered Were the sandwiches not thin
enough Were there shells in the nut cakes Had a lady visitor seen
the hole in Susie Hawthorns stocking HadO horrorsone of the
cherubic little babes in her own room F sauced a Trustee

The long lower hall had not been lighted and as she came downstairs a
last Trustee stood on the point of departure in the open door that
led to the portecochere Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression of
the manand the impression consisted entirely of tallness He was
waving his arm towards an automobile waiting in the curved drive As
it sprang into motion and approached head on for an instant the
glaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside
The shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran along
the floor and up the wall of the corridor It looked for all the
world like a huge wavering daddylonglegs

Jerushas anxious frown gave place to quick laughter She was by
nature a sunny soul and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be
amused If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the
oppressive fact of a Trustee it was something unexpected to the good
She advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode and
presented a smiling face to Mrs Lippett To her surprise the matron
was also if not exactly smiling at least appreciably affable she
wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned for
visitors

Sit down Jerusha I have something to say to you Jerusha dropped
into the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness An
automobile flashed past the window Mrs Lippett glanced after it

Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone

I saw his back

He is one of our most affluential Trustees and has given large sums
of money towards the asylums support I am not at liberty to mention
his name he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown

Jerushas eyes widened slightly she was not accustomed to being
summoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees with
the matron

This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys You
remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize They were both sent through
college by Mrerthis Trustee and both have repaid with hard work
and success the money that was so generously expended Other payment
the gentleman does not wish Heretofore his philanthropies have been
directed solely towards the boys I have never been able to interest
him in the slightest degree in any of the girls in the institution no
matter how deserving He does not I may tell you care for girls

No maam Jerusha murmured since some reply seemed to be expected
at this point

Today at the regular meeting the question of your future was brought
up

Mrs Lippett allowed a moment of silence to fall then resumed in a
slow placid manner extremely trying to her hearers suddenly tightened
nerves

Usually as you know the children are not kept after they are
sixteen but an exception was made in your case You had finished our
school at fourteen and having done so well in your studiesnot
always I must say in your conductit was determined to let you go on
in the village high school Now you are finishing that and of course
the asylum cannot be responsible any longer for your support As it
is you have had two years more than most

Mrs Lippett overlooked the fact that Jerusha had worked hard for her
board during those two years that the convenience of the asylum had
come first and her education second that on days like the present she
was kept at home to scrub

As I say the question of your future was brought up and your record
was discussedthoroughly discussed

Mrs Lippett brought accusing eyes to bear upon the prisoner in the
dock and the prisoner looked guilty because it seemed to be
expectednot because she could remember any strikingly black pages in
her record

Of course the usual disposition of one in your place would be to put
you in a position where you could begin to work but you have done well
in school in certain branches it seems that your work in English has
even been brilliant Miss Pritchard who is on our visiting committee
is also on the school board she has been talking with your rhetoric
teacher and made a speech in your favour She also read aloud an
essay that you had written entitled Blue Wednesday

Jerushas guilty expression this time was not assumed

It seemed to me that you showed little gratitude in holding up to
ridicule the institution that has done so much for you Had you not
managed to be funny I doubt if you would have been forgiven But
fortunately for you Mr that is the gentleman who has just
goneappears to have an immoderate sense of humour On the strength
of that impertinent paper he has offered to send you to college

To college Jerushas eyes grew big Mrs Lippett nodded

He waited to discuss the terms with me They are unusual The
gentleman I may say is erratic He believes that you have
originality and he is planning to educate you to become a writer

A writer Jerushas mind was numbed She could only repeat Mrs
Lippetts words

That is his wish Whether anything will come of it the future will
show He is giving you a very liberal allowance almost for a girl
who has never had any experience in taking care of money too liberal
But he planned the matter in detail and I did not feel free to make
any suggestions You are to remain here through the summer and Miss
Pritchard has kindly offered to superintend your outfit Your board
and tuition will be paid directly to the college and you will receive
in addition during the four years you are there an allowance of
thirtyfive dollars a month This will enable you to enter on the same
standing as the other students The money will be sent to you by the
gentlemans private secretary once a month and in return you will
write a letter of acknowledgment once a month That isyou are not to
thank him for the money he doesnt care to have that mentioned but
you are to write a letter telling of the progress in your studies and
the details of your daily life Just such a letter as you would write
to your parents if they were living

These letters will be addressed to Mr John Smith and will be sent in
care of the secretary The gentlemans name is not John Smith but he
prefers to remain unknown To you he will never be anything but John
Smith His reason in requiring the letters is that he thinks nothing
so fosters facility in literary expression as letterwriting Since you
have no family with whom to correspond he desires you to write in this
way also he wishes to keep track of your progress He will never
answer your letters nor in the slightest particular take any notice of
them He detests letterwriting and does not wish you to become a
burden If any point should ever arise where an answer would seem to
be imperativesuch as in the event of your being expelled which I
trust will not occuryou may correspond with Mr Griggs his
secretary These monthly letters are absolutely obligatory on your
part they are the only payment that Mr Smith requires so you must be
as punctilious in sending them as though it were a bill that you were
paying I hope that they will always be respectful in tone and will
reflect credit on your training You must remember that you are
writing to a Trustee of the John Grier Home

Jerushas eyes longingly sought the door Her head was in a whirl of
excitement and she wished only to escape from Mrs Lippetts
platitudes and think She rose and took a tentative step backwards
Mrs Lippett detained her with a gesture it was an oratorical
opportunity not to be slighted

I trust that you are properly grateful for this very rare good fortune
that has befallen you Not many girls in your position ever have such
an opportunity to rise in the world You must always remember

Iyes maam thank you I think if thats all I must go and sew a
patch on Freddie Perkinss trousers

The door closed behind her and Mrs Lippett watched it with dropped
jaw her peroration in midair




The Letters of

Miss Jerusha Abbott

to

Mr DaddyLongLegs Smith


 215 FERGUSSEN HALL
 24th September

Dear KindTrusteeWhoSendsOrphanstoCollege

Here I am I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train Its a
funny sensation isnt it I never rode in one before

College is the biggest most bewildering placeI get lost whenever I
leave my room I will write you a description later when Im feeling
less muddled also I will tell you about my lessons Classes dont
begin until Monday morning and this is Saturday night But I wanted
to write a letter first just to get acquainted

It seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you dont know It
seems queer for me to be writing letters at allIve never written
more than three or four in my life so please overlook it if these are
not a model kind

Before leaving yesterday morning Mrs Lippett and I had a very serious
talk She told me how to behave all the rest of my life and
especially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing so
much for me I must take care to be Very Respectful

But how can one be very respectful to a person who wishes to be called
John Smith Why couldnt you have picked out a name with a little
personality I might as well write letters to Dear HitchingPost or
Dear ClothesProp

I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer having
somebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me feel as
though I had found a sort of family It seems as though I belonged to
somebody now and its a very comfortable sensation I must say
however that when I think about you my imagination has very little to
work upon There are just three things that I know

I You are tall

II You are rich

III You hate girls

I suppose I might call you Dear Mr GirlHater Only thats rather
insulting to me Or Dear Mr RichMan but thats insulting to you as
though money were the only important thing about you Besides being
rich is such a very external quality Maybe you wont stay rich all
your life lots of very clever men get smashed up in Wall Street But
at least you will stay tall all your life So Ive decided to call you
Dear DaddyLongLegs I hope you wont mind Its just a private pet
name we wont tell Mrs Lippett

The ten oclock bell is going to ring in two minutes Our day is
divided into sections by bells We eat and sleep and study by bells
Its very enlivening I feel like a fire horse all of the time There
it goes Lights out Good night

Observe with what precision I obey rulesdue to my training in the
John Grier Home

 Yours most respectfully
 Jerusha Abbott




To Mr DaddyLongLegs Smith

 1st October

Dear DaddyLongLegs

I love college and I love you for sending meIm very very happy and
so excited every moment of the time that I can scarcely sleep You
cant imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home I never
dreamed there was such a place in the world Im feeling sorry for
everybody who isnt a girl and who cant come here I am sure the
college you attended when you were a boy couldnt have been so nice

My room is up in a tower that used to be the contagious ward before
they built the new infirmary There are three other girls on the same
floor of the towera Senior who wears spectacles and is always asking
us please to be a little more quiet and two Freshmen named Sallie
McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton Sallie has red hair and a
turnup nose and is quite friendly Julia comes from one of the first
families in New York and hasnt noticed me yet They room together and
the Senior and I have singles Usually Freshmen cant get singles
they are very scarce but I got one without even asking I suppose the
registrar didnt think it would be right to ask a properly broughtup
girl to room with a foundling You see there are advantages

My room is on the northwest corner with two windows and a view After
youve lived in a ward for eighteen years with twenty roommates it is
restful to be alone This is the first chance Ive ever had to get
acquainted with Jerusha Abbott I think Im going to like her

Do you think you are


 Tuesday

They are organizing the Freshman basketball team and theres just a
chance that I shall get in it Im little of course but terribly
quick and wiry and tough While the others are hopping about in the
air I can dodge under their feet and grab the ball Its loads of fun
practisingout in the athletic field in the afternoon with the trees
all red and yellow and the air full of the smell of burning leaves and
everybody laughing and shouting These are the happiest girls I ever
sawand I am the happiest of all

I meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things Im learning
Mrs Lippett said you wanted to know but 7th hour has just rung and
in ten minutes Im due at the athletic field in gymnasium clothes
Dont you hope Ill get in the team

 Yours always
 Jerusha Abbott

PS 9 oclock

Sallie McBride just poked her head in at my door This is what she
said

Im so homesick that I simply cant stand it Do you feel that way

I smiled a little and said no I thought I could pull through At
least homesickness is one disease that Ive escaped I never heard of
anybody being asylumsick did you




 10th October

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Did you ever hear of Michael Angelo

He was a famous artist who lived in Italy in the Middle Ages
Everybody in English Literature seemed to know about him and the whole
class laughed because I thought he was an archangel He sounds like an
archangel doesnt he The trouble with college is that you are
expected to know such a lot of things youve never learned Its very
embarrassing at times But now when the girls talk about things that
I never heard of I just keep still and look them up in the
encyclopedia

I made an awful mistake the first day Somebody mentioned Maurice
Maeterlinck and I asked if she was a Freshman That joke has gone all
over college But anyway Im just as bright in class as any of the
othersand brighter than some of them

Do you care to know how Ive furnished my room Its a symphony in
brown and yellow The wall was tinted buff and Ive bought yellow
denim curtains and cushions and a mahogany desk second hand for three
dollars and a rattan chair and a brown rug with an ink spot in the
middle I stand the chair over the spot

The windows are up high you cant look out from an ordinary seat But
I unscrewed the lookingglass from the back of the bureau upholstered
the top and moved it up against the window Its just the right height
for a window seat You pull out the drawers like steps and walk up
Very comfortable

Sallie McBride helped me choose the things at the Senior auction She
has lived in a house all her life and knows about furnishing You
cant imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real fivedollar
bill and get some changewhen youve never had more than a few cents
in your life I assure you Daddy dear I do appreciate that allowance

Sallie is the most entertaining person in the worldand Julia Rutledge
Pendleton the least so Its queer what a mixture the registrar can
make in the matter of roommates Sallie thinks everything is
funnyeven flunkingand Julia is bored at everything She never
makes the slightest effort to be amiable She believes that if you are
a Pendleton that fact alone admits you to heaven without any further
examination Julia and I were born to be enemies

And now I suppose youve been waiting very impatiently to hear what I
am learning

I Latin Second Punic war Hannibal and his forces pitched camp at
Lake Trasimenus last night They prepared an ambuscade for the Romans
and a battle took place at the fourth watch this morning Romans in
retreat

II French 24 pages of the Three Musketeers and third conjugation
irregular verbs

III Geometry Finished cylinders now doing cones

IV English Studying exposition My style improves daily in
clearness and brevity

V Physiology Reached the digestive system Bile and the pancreas
next time Yours on the way to being educated

 Jerusha Abbott

PS I hope you never touch alcohol Daddy It does dreadful things to
your liver




 Wednesday

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Ive changed my name

Im still Jerusha in the catalogue but Im Judy everywhere else
Its really too bad isnt it to have to give yourself the only pet
name you ever had I didnt quite make up the Judy though Thats
what Freddy Perkins used to call me before he could talk plainly

I wish Mrs Lippett would use a little more ingenuity about choosing
babies names She gets the last names out of the telephone
bookyoull find Abbott on the first pageand she picks the Christian
names up anywhere she got Jerusha from a tombstone Ive always hated
it but I rather like Judy Its such a silly name It belongs to the
kind of girl Im nota sweet little blueeyed thing petted and
spoiled by all the family who romps her way through life without any
cares Wouldnt it be nice to be like that Whatever faults I may
have no one can ever accuse me of having been spoiled by my family
But its great fun to pretend Ive been In the future please always
address me as Judy

Do you want to know something I have three pairs of kid gloves Ive
had kid mittens before from the Christmas tree but never real kid
gloves with five fingers I take them out and try them on every little
while Its all I can do not to wear them to classes

Dinner bell Goodbye




 Friday

What do you think Daddy The English instructor said that my last
paper shows an unusual amount of originality She did truly Those
were her words It doesnt seem possible does it considering the
eighteen years of training that Ive had The aim of the John Grier
Home as you doubtless know and heartily approve of is to turn the
ninetyseven orphans into ninetyseven twins

The unusual artistic ability which I exhibit was developed at an early
age through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs Lippett on the woodshed door

I hope that I dont hurt your feelings when I criticize the home of my
youth But you have the upper hand you know for if I become too
impertinent you can always stop payment of your cheques That isnt a
very polite thing to saybut you cant expect me to have any manners
a foundling asylum isnt a young ladies finishing school

You know Daddy it isnt the work that is going to be hard in college
Its the play Half the time I dont know what the girls are talking
about their jokes seem to relate to a past that every one but me has
shared Im a foreigner in the world and I dont understand the
language Its a miserable feeling Ive had it all my life At the
high school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me I was
queer and different and everybody knew it I could FEEL John Grier
Home written on my face And then a few charitable ones would make a
point of coming up and saying something polite I HATED EVERY ONE OF
THEMthe charitable ones most of all

Nobody here knows that I was brought up in an asylum I told Sallie
McBride that my mother and father were dead and that a kind old
gentleman was sending me to college which is entirely true so far as it
goes I dont want you to think I am a coward but I do want to be
like the other girls and that Dreadful Home looming over my childhood
is the one great big difference If I can turn my back on that and
shut out the remembrance I think I might be just as desirable as any
other girl I dont believe theres any real underneath difference
do you

Anyway Sallie McBride likes me

 Yours ever
 Judy Abbott
 Nee Jerusha




 Saturday morning

Ive just been reading this letter over and it sounds pretty
uncheerful But cant you guess that I have a special topic due Monday
morning and a review in geometry and a very sneezy cold




 Sunday

I forgot to post this yesterday so I will add an indignant postscript
We had a bishop this morning and WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID

The most beneficent promise made us in the Bible is this The poor ye
have always with you They were put here in order to keep us
charitable

The poor please observe being a sort of useful domestic animal If I
hadnt grown into such a perfect lady I should have gone up after
service and told him what I thought




 25th October

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Im in the basketball team and you ought to see the bruise on my left
shoulder Its blue and mahogany with little streaks of orange Julia
Pendleton tried for the team but she didnt get in Hooray

You see what a mean disposition I have

College gets nicer and nicer I like the girls and the teachers and
the classes and the campus and the things to eat We have icecream
twice a week and we never have cornmeal mush

You only wanted to hear from me once a month didnt you And Ive
been peppering you with letters every few days But Ive been so
excited about all these new adventures that I MUST talk to somebody
and youre the only one I know Please excuse my exuberance Ill
settle pretty soon If my letters bore you you can always toss them
into the wastebasket I promise not to write another till the middle
of November

 Yours most loquaciously
 Judy Abbott





 15th November

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Listen to what Ive learned today

The area of the convex surface of the frustum of a regular pyramid is
half the product of the sum of the perimeters of its bases by the
altitude of either of its trapezoids

It doesnt sound true but it isI can prove it

Youve never heard about my clothes have you Daddy Six dresses all
new and beautiful and bought for menot handed down from somebody
bigger Perhaps you dont realize what a climax that marks in the
career of an orphan You gave them to me and I am very very VERY
much obliged Its a fine thing to be educatedbut nothing compared
to the dizzying experience of owning six new dresses Miss Pritchard
who is on the visiting committee picked them outnot Mrs Lippett
thank goodness I have an evening dress pink mull over silk Im
perfectly beautiful in that and a blue church dress and a dinner
dress of red veiling with Oriental trimming makes me look like a
Gipsy and another of rosecoloured challis and a grey street suit
and an everyday dress for classes That wouldnt be an awfully big
wardrobe for Julia Rutledge Pendleton perhaps but for Jerusha
AbbottOh my

I suppose youre thinking now what a frivolous shallow little beast
she is and what a waste of money to educate a girl

But Daddy if youd been dressed in checked ginghams all your life
youd appreciate how I feel And when I started to the high school I
entered upon another period even worse than the checked ginghams

The poor box

You cant know how I dreaded appearing in school in those miserable
poorbox dresses I was perfectly sure to be put down in class next to
the girl who first owned my dress and she would whisper and giggle and
point it out to the others The bitterness of wearing your enemies
castoff clothes eats into your soul If I wore silk stockings for the
rest of my life I dont believe I could obliterate the scar

 LATEST WAR BULLETIN

 News from the Scene of Action

PS I know Im not to expect any letters in return and Ive been
warned not to bother you with questions but tell me Daddy just this
onceare you awfully old or just a little old And are you perfectly
bald or just a little bald It is very difficult thinking about you in
the abstract like a theorem in geometry

Given a tall rich man who hates girls but is very generous to one
quite impertinent girl what does he look like

 19th December

Dear DaddyLongLegs

You never answered my question and it was very important

 ARE YOU BALD


I have it planned exactly what you look likevery
satisfactorilyuntil I reach the top of your head and then I AM
stuck I cant decide whether you have white hair or black hair or
sort of sprinkly grey hair or maybe none at all

Here is your portrait

But the problem is shall I add some hair

Would you like to know what colour your eyes are Theyre grey and
your eyebrows stick out like a porch roof beetling theyre called in
novels and your mouth is a straight line with a tendency to turn down
at the corners Oh you see I know Youre a snappy old thing with a
temper

 Chapel bell


 945 pm

I have a new unbreakable rule never never to study at night no
matter how many written reviews are coming in the morning Instead I
read just plain booksI have to you know because there are eighteen
blank years behind me You wouldnt believe Daddy what an abyss of
ignorance my mind is I am just realizing the depths myself The
things that most girls with a properly assorted family and a home and
friends and a library know by absorption I have never heard of For
example

I never read Mother Goose or David Copperfield or Ivanhoe or Cinderella
or Blue Beard or Robinson Crusoe or Jane Eyre or Alice in Wonderland or
a word of Rudyard Kipling I didnt know that Henry the Eighth was
married more than once or that Shelley was a poet I didnt know that
people used to be monkeys and that the Garden of Eden was a beautiful
myth I didnt know that R L S stood for Robert Louis Stevenson or
that George Eliot was a lady I had never seen a picture of the Mona
Lisa and its true but you wont believe it I had never heard of
Sherlock Holmes

Now I know all of these things and a lot of others besides but you
can see how much I need to catch up And oh but its fun I look
forward all day to evening and then I put an engaged on the door and
get into my nice red bath robe and furry slippers and pile all the
cushions behind me on the couch and light the brass student lamp at my
elbow and read and read and read one book isnt enough I have four
going at once Just now theyre Tennysons poems and Vanity Fair and
Kiplings Plain Tales anddont laughLittle Women I find that I am
the only girl in college who wasnt brought up on Little Women I
havent told anybody though that WOULD stamp me as queer I just
quietly went and bought it with 112 of my last months allowance and
the next time somebody mentions pickled limes Ill know what she is
talking about

Ten oclock bell This is a very interrupted letter


 Saturday

Sir

I have the honour to report fresh explorations in the field of
geometry On Friday last we abandoned our former works in
parallelopipeds and proceeded to truncated prisms We are finding the
road rough and very uphill


 Sunday

The Christmas holidays begin next week and the trunks are up The
corridors are so filled up that you can hardly get through and
everybody is so bubbling over with excitement that studying is getting
left out Im going to have a beautiful time in vacation theres
another Freshman who lives in Texas staying behind and we are planning
to take long walks and if theres any icelearn to skate Then there
is still the whole library to be readand three empty weeks to do it
in

Goodbye Daddy I hope that you are feeling as happy as I am

 Yours ever
 Judy

PS Dont forget to answer my question If you dont want the trouble
of writing have your secretary telegraph He can just say

 Mr Smith is quite bald

 or

 Mr Smith is not bald

 or

 Mr Smith has white hair


And you can deduct the twentyfive cents out of my allowance

Goodbye till Januaryand a merry Christmas




 Towards the end of
 the Christmas vacation
 Exact date unknown

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Is it snowing where you are All the world that I see from my tower is
draped in white and the flakes are coming down as big as popcorns
Its late afternoonthe sun is just setting a cold yellow colour
behind some colder violet hills and I am up in my window seat using
the last light to write to you

Your five gold pieces were a surprise Im not used to receiving
Christmas presents You have already given me such lots of
thingseverything I have you knowthat I dont quite feel that I
deserve extras But I like them just the same Do you want to know
what I bought with my money

I A silver watch in a leather case to wear on my wrist and get me to
recitations in time

II Matthew Arnolds poems

III A hot water bottle

IV A steamer rug My tower is cold

V Five hundred sheets of yellow manuscript paper Im going to
commence being an author pretty soon

VI A dictionary of synonyms To enlarge the authors vocabulary

VII I dont much like to confess this last item but I will A pair
of silk stockings

And now Daddy never say I dont tell all

It was a very low motive if you must know it that prompted the silk
stockings Julia Pendleton comes into my room to do geometry and she
sits crosslegged on the couch and wears silk stockings every night
But just waitas soon as she gets back from vacation I shall go in and
sit on her couch in my silk stockings You see Daddy the miserable
creature that I am but at least Im honest and you knew already from
my asylum record that I wasnt perfect didnt you

To recapitulate thats the way the English instructor begins every
other sentence I am very much obliged for my seven presents Im
pretending to myself that they came in a box from my family in
California The watch is from father the rug from mother the hot
water bottle from grandmother who is always worrying for fear I shall
catch cold in this climateand the yellow paper from my little brother
Harry My sister Isabel gave me the silk stockings and Aunt Susan the
Matthew Arnold poems Uncle Harry little Harry is named after him
gave me the dictionary He wanted to send chocolates but I insisted
on synonyms

You dont object do you to playing the part of a composite family

And now shall I tell you about my vacation or are you only interested
in my education as such I hope you appreciate the delicate shade of
meaning in as such It is the latest addition to my vocabulary

The girl from Texas is named Leonora Fenton Almost as funny as
Jerusha isnt it I like her but not so much as Sallie McBride I
shall never like any one so much as Sallieexcept you I must always
like you the best of all because youre my whole family rolled into
one Leonora and I and two Sophomores have walked cross country every
pleasant day and explored the whole neighbourhood dressed in short
skirts and knit jackets and caps and carrying shiny sticks to whack
things with Once we walked into townfour milesand stopped at a
restaurant where the college girls go for dinner Broiled lobster 35
cents and for dessert buckwheat cakes and maple syrup 15 cents
Nourishing and cheap

It was such a lark Especially for me because it was so awfully
different from the asylumI feel like an escaped convict every time I
leave the campus Before I thought I started to tell the others what
an experience I was having The cat was almost out of the bag when I
grabbed it by its tail and pulled it back Its awfully hard for me
not to tell everything I know Im a very confiding soul by nature if
I didnt have you to tell things to Id burst

We had a molasses candy pull last Friday evening given by the house
matron of Fergussen to the leftbehinds in the other halls There were
twentytwo of us altogether Freshmen and Sophomores and juniors and
Seniors all united in amicable accord The kitchen is huge with
copper pots and kettles hanging in rows on the stone wallthe littlest
casserole among them about the size of a wash boiler Four hundred
girls live in Fergussen The chef in a white cap and apron fetched
out twentytwo other white caps and apronsI cant imagine where he
got so manyand we all turned ourselves into cooks

It was great fun though I have seen better candy When it was finally
finished and ourselves and the kitchen and the doorknobs all
thoroughly sticky we organized a procession and still in our caps and
aprons each carrying a big fork or spoon or frying pan we marched
through the empty corridors to the officers parlour where
halfadozen professors and instructors were passing a tranquil
evening We serenaded them with college songs and offered
refreshments They accepted politely but dubiously We left them
sucking chunks of molasses candy sticky and speechless

So you see Daddy my education progresses

Dont you really think that I ought to be an artist instead of an
author

Vacation will be over in two days and I shall be glad to see the girls
again My tower is just a trifle lonely when nine people occupy a
house that was built for four hundred they do rattle around a bit

Eleven pagespoor Daddy you must be tired I meant this to be just a
short little thankyou notebut when I get started I seem to have a
ready pen

Goodbye and thank you for thinking of meI should be perfectly happy
except for one little threatening cloud on the horizon Examinations
come in February

 Yours with love
 Judy

PS Maybe it isnt proper to send love If it isnt please excuse
But I must love somebody and theres only you and Mrs Lippett to
choose between so you seeyoull HAVE to put up with it Daddy dear
because I cant love her




 On the Eve

Dear DaddyLongLegs

You should see the way this college is studying Weve forgotten we
ever had a vacation Fiftyseven irregular verbs have I introduced to
my brain in the past four daysIm only hoping theyll stay till after
examinations

Some of the girls sell their textbooks when theyre through with them
but I intend to keep mine Then after Ive graduated I shall have my
whole education in a row in the bookcase and when I need to use any
detail I can turn to it without the slightest hesitation So much
easier and more accurate than trying to keep it in your head

Julia Pendleton dropped in this evening to pay a social call and
stayed a solid hour She got started on the subject of family and I
COULDNT switch her off She wanted to know what my mothers maiden
name wasdid you ever hear such an impertinent question to ask of a
person from a foundling asylum I didnt have the courage to say I
didnt know so I just miserably plumped on the first name I could
think of and that was Montgomery Then she wanted to know whether I
belonged to the Massachusetts Montgomerys or the Virginia Montgomerys

Her mother was a Rutherford The family came over in the ark and were
connected by marriage with Henry the VIII On her fathers side they
date back further than Adam On the topmost branches of her family
tree theres a superior breed of monkeys with very fine silky hair and
extra long tails

I meant to write you a nice cheerful entertaining letter tonight but
Im too sleepyand scared The Freshmans lot is not a happy one

 Yours about to be examined
 Judy Abbott




 Sunday

Dearest DaddyLongLegs

I have some awful awful awful news to tell you but I wont begin
with it Ill try to get you in a good humour first

Jerusha Abbott has commenced to be an author A poem entitled From
my Tower appears in the February Monthlyon the first page which is
a very great honour for a Freshman My English instructor stopped me
on the way out from chapel last night and said it was a charming piece
of work except for the sixth line which had too many feet I will
send you a copy in case you care to read it

Let me see if I cant think of something else pleasant Oh yes Im
learning to skate and can glide about quite respectably all by myself
Also Ive learned how to slide down a rope from the roof of the
gymnasium and I can vault a bar three feet and six inches highI hope
shortly to pull up to four feet

We had a very inspiring sermon this morning preached by the Bishop of
Alabama His text was Judge not that ye be not judged It was
about the necessity of overlooking mistakes in others and not
discouraging people by harsh judgments I wish you might have heard it

This is the sunniest most blinding winter afternoon with icicles
dripping from the fir trees and all the world bending under a weight of
snowexcept me and Im bending under a weight of sorrow

Now for the newscourage Judyyou must tell

Are you SURELY in a good humour I failed in mathematics and Latin
prose I am tutoring in them and will take another examination next
month Im sorry if youre disappointed but otherwise I dont care a
bit because Ive learned such a lot of things not mentioned in the
catalogue Ive read seventeen novels and bushels of poetryreally
necessary novels like Vanity Fair and Richard Feverel and Alice in
Wonderland Also Emersons Essays and Lockharts Life of Scott and the
first volume of Gibbons Roman Empire and half of Benvenuto Cellinis
Lifewasnt he entertaining He used to saunter out and casually kill
a man before breakfast

So you see Daddy Im much more intelligent than if Id just stuck to
Latin Will you forgive me this once if I promise never to fail again

 Yours in sackcloth
 Judy




Dear DaddyLongLegs

This is an extra letter in the middle of the month because Im rather
lonely tonight Its awfully stormy All the lights are out on the
campus but I drank black coffee and I cant go to sleep

I had a supper party this evening consisting of Sallie and Julia and
Leonora Fentonand sardines and toasted muffins and salad and fudge
and coffee Julia said shed had a good time but Sallie stayed to
help wash the dishes


I might very usefully put some time on Latin tonight but theres no
doubt about it Im a very languid Latin scholar Weve finished Livy
and De Senectute and are now engaged with De Amicitia pronounced Damn
Icitia

Should you mind just for a little while pretending you are my
grandmother Sallie has one and Julia and Leonora each two and they
were all comparing them tonight I cant think of anything Id rather
have its such a respectable relationship So if you really dont
objectWhen I went into town yesterday I saw the sweetest cap of
Cluny lace trimmed with lavender ribbon I am going to make you a
present of it on your eightythird birthday

           

Thats the clock in the chapel tower striking twelve I believe I am
sleepy after all

 Good night Granny
 I love you dearly
 Judy

pressing engagement with the Ablative Absolute

 Yoursin evident haste
 J A




 26th March

Mr DLL Smith

SIR You never answer any questions you never show the slightest
interest in anything I do You are probably the horridest one of all
those horrid Trustees and the reason you are educating me is not
because you care a bit about me but from a sense of Duty

I dont know a single thing about you I dont even know your name
It is very uninspiring writing to a Thing I havent a doubt but that
you throw my letters into the wastebasket without reading them
Hereafter I shall write only about work

My reexaminations in Latin and geometry came last week I passed them
both and am now free from conditions

 Yours truly
 Jerusha Abbott




 2nd April

Dear DaddyLongLegs

I am a BEAST

Please forget about that dreadful letter I sent you last weekI was
feeling terribly lonely and miserable and sorethroaty the night I
wrote I didnt know it but I was just sickening for tonsillitis and
grippe and lots of things mixed Im in the infirmary now and have
been here for six days this is the first time they would let me sit up
and have a pen and paper The head nurse is very bossy But Ive been
thinking about it all the time and I shant get well until you forgive
me

Here is a picture of the way I look with a bandage tied around my head
in rabbits ears

Doesnt that arouse your sympathy I am having sublingual gland
swelling And Ive been studying physiology all the year without ever
hearing of sublingual glands How futile a thing is education

I cant write any more I get rather shaky when I sit up too long
Please forgive me for being impertinent and ungrateful I was badly
brought up

 Yours with love
 Judy Abbott




 THE INFIRMARY
 4th April

Dearest DaddyLongLegs

Yesterday evening just towards dark when I was sitting up in bed
looking out at the rain and feeling awfully bored with life in a great
institution the nurse appeared with a long white box addressed to me
and filled with the LOVELIEST pink rosebuds And much nicer still it
contained a card with a very polite message written in a funny little
uphill back hand but one which shows a great deal of character Thank
you Daddy a thousand times Your flowers make the first real true
present I ever received in my life If you want to know what a baby I
am I lay down and cried because I was so happy

Now that I am sure you read my letters Ill make them much more
interesting so theyll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape around
themonly please take out that dreadful one and burn it up Id hate
to think that you ever read it over

Thank you for making a very sick cross miserable Freshman cheerful
Probably you have lots of loving family and friends and you dont know
what it feels like to be alone But I do

GoodbyeIll promise never to be horrid again because now I know
youre a real person also Ill promise never to bother you with any
more questions

Do you still hate girls

 Yours for ever
 Judy




 8th hour Monday

Dear DaddyLongLegs

I hope you arent the Trustee who sat on the toad It went offI was
toldwith quite a pop so probably he was a fatter Trustee

Do you remember the little dugout places with gratings over them by the
laundry windows in the John Grier Home Every spring when the hoptoad
season opened we used to form a collection of toads and keep them in
those window holes and occasionally they would spill over into the
laundry causing a very pleasurable commotion on wash days We were
severely punished for our activities in this direction but in spite of
all discouragement the toads would collect

And one daywell I wont bore you with particularsbut somehow one
of the fattest biggest JUCIEST toads got into one of those big
leather arm chairs in the Trustees room and that afternoon at the
Trustees meetingBut I dare say you were there and recall the rest

Looking back dispassionately after a period of time I will say that
punishment was merited andif I remember rightlyadequate

I dont know why I am in such a reminiscent mood except that spring and
the reappearance of toads always awakens the old acquisitive instinct
The only thing that keeps me from starting a collection is the fact
that no rule exists against it


 After chapel Thursday

What do you think is my favourite book Just now I mean I change
every three days Wuthering Heights Emily Bronte was quite young
when she wrote it and had never been outside of Haworth churchyard
She had never known any men in her life how COULD she imagine a man
like Heathcliffe

I couldnt do it and Im quite young and never outside the John Grier
AsylumIve had every chance in the world Sometimes a dreadful fear
comes over me that Im not a genius Will you be awfully disappointed
Daddy if I dont turn out to be a great author In the spring when
everything is so beautiful and green and budding I feel like turning
my back on lessons and running away to play with the weather There
are such lots of adventures out in the fields Its much more
entertaining to live books than to write them

Ow      

That was a shriek which brought Sallie and Julia and for a disgusted
moment the Senior from across the hall It was caused by a centipede
like this only worse Just as I had finished the last sentence and
was thinking what to say nextplumpit fell off the ceiling and
landed at my side I tipped two cups off the tea table in trying to
get away Sallie whacked it with the back of my hair brushwhich I
shall never be able to use againand killed the front end but the
rear fifty feet ran under the bureau and escaped

This dormitory owing to its age and ivycovered walls is full of
centipedes They are dreadful creatures Id rather find a tiger
under the bed


 Friday 930 pm

Such a lot of troubles I didnt hear the rising bell this morning
then I broke my shoestring while I was hurrying to dress and dropped my
collar button down my neck I was late for breakfast and also for
firsthour recitation I forgot to take any blotting paper and my
fountain pen leaked In trigonometry the Professor and I had a
disagreement touching a little matter of logarithms On looking it up
I find that she was right We had mutton stew and pieplant for
lunchhate em both they taste like the asylum The post brought me
nothing but bills though I must say that I never do get anything else
my family are not the kind that write In English class this
afternoon we had an unexpected written lesson This was it

 I asked no other thing
 No other was denied
 I offered Being for it
 The mighty merchant smiled

 Brazil He twirled a button
 Without a glance my way
 But madam is there nothing else
 That we can show today


That is a poem I dont know who wrote it or what it means It was
simply printed out on the blackboard when we arrived and we were
ordered to comment upon it When I read the first verse I thought I
had an ideaThe Mighty Merchant was a divinity who distributes
blessings in return for virtuous deedsbut when I got to the second
verse and found him twirling a button it seemed a blasphemous
supposition and I hastily changed my mind The rest of the class was
in the same predicament and there we sat for threequarters of an hour
with blank paper and equally blank minds Getting an education is an
awfully wearing process

But this didnt end the day Theres worse to come

It rained so we couldnt play golf but had to go to gymnasium instead
The girl next to me banged my elbow with an Indian club I got home to
find that the box with my new blue spring dress had come and the skirt
was so tight that I couldnt sit down Friday is sweeping day and the
maid had mixed all the papers on my desk We had tombstone for dessert
milk and gelatin flavoured with vanilla We were kept in chapel
twenty minutes later than usual to listen to a speech about womanly
women And thenjust as I was settling down with a sigh of
wellearned relief to The Portrait of a Lady a girl named Ackerly a
doughfaced deadly unintermittently stupid girl who sits next to me
in Latin because her name begins with A I wish Mrs Lippett had named
me Zabriski came to ask if Mondays lesson commenced at paragraph 69
or 70 and stayed ONE HOUR She has just gone

Did you ever hear of such a discouraging series of events It isnt
the big troubles in life that require character Anybody can rise to a
crisis and face a crushing tragedy with courage but to meet the petty
hazards of the day with a laughI really think that requires SPIRIT

Its the kind of character that I am going to develop I am going to
pretend that all life is just a game which I must play as skilfully and
fairly as I can If I lose I am going to shrug my shoulders and
laughalso if I win

Anyway I am going to be a sport You will never hear me complain
again Daddy dear because Julia wears silk stockings and centipedes
drop off the wall

 Yours ever
 Judy

Answer soon




 27th May

DaddyLongLegs Esq

DEAR SIR I am in receipt of a letter from Mrs Lippett She hopes
that I am doing well in deportment and studies Since I probably have
no place to go this summer she will let me come back to the asylum and
work for my board until college opens

I HATE THE JOHN GRIER HOME

Id rather die than go back

 Yours most truthfully
 Jerusha Abbott



Cher DaddyJambesLonges

Professeur is going to call on me tout de suite

 Au revoir
 je vous aime beaucoup
 Judy




 30th May

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Did you ever see this campus That is merely a rhetorical question
Dont let it annoy you It is a heavenly spot in May All the shrubs
are in blossom and the trees are the loveliest young greeneven the
old pines look fresh and new The grass is dotted with yellow
dandelions and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses
Everybody is joyous and carefree for vacations coming and with that
to look forward to examinations dont count

Isnt that a happy frame of mind to be in And oh Daddy Im the
happiest of all Because Im not in the asylum any more and Im not
anybodys nursemaid or typewriter or bookkeeper I should have been
you know except for you

Im sorry now for all my past badnesses

Im sorry I was ever impertinent to Mrs Lippett

Im sorry I ever slapped Freddie Perkins

Im sorry I ever filled the sugar bowl with salt

Im sorry I ever made faces behind the Trustees backs

Im going to be good and sweet and kind to everybody because Im so
happy And this summer Im going to write and write and write and
begin to be a great author Isnt that an exalted stand to take Oh
Im developing a beautiful character It droops a bit under cold and
frost but it does grow fast when the sun shines

Thats the way with everybody I dont agree with the theory that
adversity and sorrow and disappointment develop moral strength The
happy people are the ones who are bubbling over with kindliness I
have no faith in misanthropes Fine word Just learned it You are
not a misanthrope are you Daddy

I started to tell you about the campus I wish youd come for a little
visit and let me walk you about and say

That is the library This is the gas plant Daddy dear The Gothic
building on your left is the gymnasium and the Tudor Romanesque beside
it is the new infirmary

Oh Im fine at showing people about Ive done it all my life at the
asylum and Ive been doing it all day here I have honestly

And a Man too

Thats a great experience I never talked to a man before except
occasional Trustees and they dont count Pardon Daddy I dont mean
to hurt your feelings when I abuse Trustees I dont consider that you
really belong among them You just tumbled on to the Board by chance
The Trustee as such is fat and pompous and benevolent He pats one
on the head and wears a gold watch chain

That looks like a June bug but is meant to be a portrait of any
Trustee except you

Howeverto resume

I have been walking and talking and having tea with a man And with a
very superior manwith Mr Jervis Pendleton of the House of Julia her
uncle in short in long perhaps I ought to say hes as tall as you
Being in town on business he decided to run out to the college and
call on his niece Hes her fathers youngest brother but she doesnt
know him very intimately It seems he glanced at her when she was a
baby decided he didnt like her and has never noticed her since

Anyway there he was sitting in the reception room very proper with
his hat and stick and gloves beside him and Julia and Sallie with
seventhhour recitations that they couldnt cut So Julia dashed into
my room and begged me to walk him about the campus and then deliver him
to her when the seventh hour was over I said I would obligingly but
unenthusiastically because I dont care much for Pendletons

But he turned out to be a sweet lamb Hes a real human beingnot a
Pendleton at all We had a beautiful time Ive longed for an uncle
ever since Do you mind pretending youre my uncle I believe theyre
superior to grandmothers

Mr Pendleton reminded me a little of you Daddy as you were twenty
years ago You see I know you intimately even if we havent ever met

Hes tall and thinnish with a dark face all over lines and the
funniest underneath smile that never quite comes through but just
wrinkles up the corners of his mouth And he has a way of making you
feel right off as though youd known him a long time Hes very
companionable

We walked all over the campus from the quadrangle to the athletic
grounds then he said he felt weak and must have some tea He proposed
that we go to College Innits just off the campus by the pine walk
I said we ought to go back for Julia and Sallie but he said he didnt
like to have his nieces drink too much tea it made them nervous So
we just ran away and had tea and muffins and marmalade and icecream
and cake at a nice little table out on the balcony The inn was quite
conveniently empty this being the end of the month and allowances low

We had the jolliest time But he had to run for his train the minute
he got back and he barely saw Julia at all She was furious with me
for taking him off it seems hes an unusually rich and desirable
uncle It relieved my mind to find he was rich for the tea and things
cost sixty cents apiece

This morning its Monday now three boxes of chocolates came by
express for Julia and Sallie and me What do you think of that To be
getting candy from a man

I begin to feel like a girl instead of a foundling

I wish youd come and have tea some day and let me see if I like you
But wouldnt it be dreadful if I didnt However I know I should

Bien I make you my compliments

 Jamais je ne toublierai
 Judy


PS I looked in the glass this morning and found a perfectly new
dimple that Id never seen before Its very curious Where do you
suppose it came from




 9th June

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Happy day Ive just finished my last examination Physiology And now

Three months on a farm

I dont know what kind of a thing a farm is Ive never been on one in
my life Ive never even looked at one except from the car window
but I know Im going to love it and Im going to love being FREE

I am not used even yet to being outside the John Grier Home Whenever
I think of it excited little thrills chase up and down my back I feel
as though I must run faster and faster and keep looking over my
shoulder to make sure that Mrs Lippett isnt after me with her arm
stretched out to grab me back

I dont have to mind any one this summer do I

Your nominal authority doesnt annoy me in the least you are too far
away to do any harm Mrs Lippett is dead for ever so far as I am
concerned and the Semples arent expected to overlook my moral
welfare are they No I am sure not I am entirely grown up Hooray

I leave you now to pack a trunk and three boxes of teakettles and
dishes and sofa cushions and books

 Yours ever
 Judy


PS Here is my physiology exam Do you think you could have passed




 LOCK WILLOW FARM
 Saturday night

Dearest DaddyLongLegs

Ive only just come and Im not unpacked but I cant wait to tell you
how much I like farms This is a heavenly heavenly HEAVENLY spot
The house is square like this And OLD A hundred years or so It
has a veranda on the side which I cant draw and a sweet porch in
front The picture really doesnt do it justicethose things that
look like feather dusters are maple trees and the prickly ones that
border the drive are murmuring pines and hemlocks It stands on the
top of a hill and looks way off over miles of green meadows to another
line of hills

That is the way Connecticut goes in a series of Marcelle waves and
Lock Willow Farm is just on the crest of one wave The barns used to
be across the road where they obstructed the view but a kind flash of
lightning came from heaven and burnt them down

The people are Mr and Mrs Semple and a hired girl and two hired men
The hired people eat in the kitchen and the Semples and Judy in the
diningroom We had ham and eggs and biscuits and honey and jellycake
and pie and pickles and cheese and tea for supperand a great deal of
conversation I have never been so entertaining in my life everything
I say appears to be funny I suppose it is because Ive never been in
the country before and my questions are backed by an allinclusive
ignorance

The room marked with a cross is not where the murder was committed but
the one that I occupy Its big and square and empty with adorable
oldfashioned furniture and windows that have to be propped up on
sticks and green shades trimmed with gold that fall down if you touch
them And a big square mahogany tableIm going to spend the summer
with my elbows spread out on it writing a novel

Oh Daddy Im so excited I cant wait till daylight to explore
Its 830 now and I am about to blow out my candle and try to go to
sleep We rise at five Did you ever know such fun I cant believe
this is really Judy You and the Good Lord give me more than I
deserve I must be a very very VERY good person to pay Im going
to be Youll see

 Good night
 Judy


PS You should hear the frogs sing and the little pigs squeal and you
should see the new moon I saw it over my right shoulder





 LOCK WILLOW
 12th July

Dear DaddyLongLegs

How did your secretary come to know about Lock Willow That isnt a
rhetorical question I am awfully curious to know For listen to
this Mr Jervis Pendleton used to own this farm but now he has given
it to Mrs Semple who was his old nurse Did you ever hear of such a
funny coincidence She still calls him Master Jervie and talks about
what a sweet little boy he used to be She has one of his baby curls
put away in a box and it is redor at least reddish

Since she discovered that I know him I have risen very much in her
opinion Knowing a member of the Pendleton family is the best
introduction one can have at Lock Willow And the cream of the whole
family is Master JervisI am pleased to say that Julia belongs to an
inferior branch

The farm gets more and more entertaining I rode on a hay wagon
yesterday We have three big pigs and nine little piglets and you
should see them eat They are pigs Weve oceans of little baby
chickens and ducks and turkeys and guinea fowls You must be mad to
live in a city when you might live on a farm

It is my daily business to hunt the eggs I fell off a beam in the
barn loft yesterday while I was trying to crawl over to a nest that
the black hen has stolen And when I came in with a scratched knee
Mrs Semple bound it up with witchhazel murmuring all the time
Dear Dear It seems only yesterday that Master Jervie fell off that
very same beam and scratched this very same knee

The scenery around here is perfectly beautiful Theres a valley and a
river and a lot of wooded hills and way in the distance a tall blue
mountain that simply melts in your mouth

We churn twice a week and we keep the cream in the spring house which
is made of stone with the brook running underneath Some of the
farmers around here have a separator but we dont care for these
newfashioned ideas It may be a little harder to separate the cream
in pans but its sufficiently better to pay We have six calves and
Ive chosen the names for all of them

1 Sylvia because she was born in the woods

2 Lesbia after the Lesbia in Catullus

3 Sallie

4 Juliaa spotted nondescript animal

5 Judy after me

6 DaddyLongLegs You dont mind do you Daddy Hes pure Jersey
and has a sweet disposition He looks like thisyou can see how
appropriate the name is

I havent had time yet to begin my immortal novel the farm keeps me
too busy

 Yours always
 Judy


PS Ive learned to make doughnuts

PS 2 If you are thinking of raising chickens let me recommend Buff
Orpingtons They havent any pin feathers

PS 3 I wish I could send you a pat of the nice fresh butter I
churned yesterday Im a fine dairymaid

PS 4 This is a picture of Miss Jerusha Abbott the future great
author driving home the cows



 Sunday

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Isnt it funny I started to write to you yesterday afternoon but as
far as I got was the heading Dear DaddyLongLegs and then I
remembered Id promised to pick some blackberries for supper so I went
off and left the sheet lying on the table and when I came back today
what do you think I found sitting in the middle of the page A real
true DaddyLongLegs

I picked him up very gently by one leg and dropped him out of the
window I wouldnt hurt one of them for the world They always remind
me of you

We hitched up the spring wagon this morning and drove to the Centre to
church Its a sweet little white frame church with a spire and three
Doric columns in front or maybe IonicI always get them mixed

A nice sleepy sermon with everybody drowsily waving palmleaf fans and
the only sound aside from the minister the buzzing of locusts in the
trees outside I didnt wake up till I found myself on my feet singing
the hymn and then I was awfully sorry I hadnt listened to the sermon
I should like to know more of the psychology of a man who would pick
out such a hymn This was it

 Come leave your sports and earthly toys
 And join me in celestial joys
 Or else dear friend a long farewell
 I leave you now to sink to hell


I find that it isnt safe to discuss religion with the Semples Their
God whom they have inherited intact from their remote Puritan
ancestors is a narrow irrational unjust mean revengeful bigoted
Person Thank heaven I dont inherit God from anybody I am free to
make mine up as I wish Him Hes kind and sympathetic and imaginative
and forgiving and understandingand He has a sense of humour

I like the Semples immensely their practice is so superior to their
theory They are better than their own God I told them soand they
are horribly troubled They think I am blasphemousand I think they
are Weve dropped theology from our conversation

This is Sunday afternoon

Amasai hired man in a purple tie and some bright yellow buckskin
gloves very red and shaved has just driven off with Carrie hired
girl in a big hat trimmed with red roses and a blue muslin dress and
her hair curled as tight as it will curl Amasai spent all the morning
washing the buggy and Carrie stayed home from church ostensibly to
cook the dinner but really to iron the muslin dress

In two minutes more when this letter is finished I am going to settle
down to a book which I found in the attic Its entitled On the
Trail and sprawled across the front page in a funny littleboy hand

 Jervis Pendleton
 if this book should ever roam
 Box its ears and send it home


He spent the summer here once after he had been ill when he was about
eleven years old and he left On the Trail behind It looks well
readthe marks of his grimy little hands are frequent Also in a
corner of the attic there is a water wheel and a windmill and some bows
and arrows Mrs Semple talks so constantly about him that I begin to
believe he really livesnot a grown man with a silk hat and walking
stick but a nice dirty tousleheaded boy who clatters up the stairs
with an awful racket and leaves the screen doors open and is always
asking for cookies And getting them too if I know Mrs Semple He
seems to have been an adventurous little souland brave and truthful
Im sorry to think he is a Pendleton he was meant for something better

Were going to begin threshing oats tomorrow a steam engine is coming
and three extra men

It grieves me to tell you that Buttercup the spotted cow with one
horn Mother of Lesbia has done a disgraceful thing She got into the
orchard Friday evening and ate apples under the trees and ate and ate
until they went to her head For two days she has been perfectly dead
drunk That is the truth I am telling Did you ever hear anything so
scandalous

 Sir
 I remain
 Your affectionate orphan
 Judy Abbott


PS Indians in the first chapter and highwaymen in the second I hold
my breath What can the third contain Red Hawk leapt twenty feet in
the air and bit the dust That is the subject of the frontispiece
Arent Judy and Jervie having fun




 15th September

Dear Daddy

I was weighed yesterday on the flour scales in the general store at the
Comers Ive gained nine pounds Let me recommend Lock Willow as a
health resort

 Yours ever
 Judy




Dear DaddyLongLegs

Behold mea Sophomore I came up last Friday sorry to leave Lock
Willow but glad to see the campus again It is a pleasant sensation
to come back to something familiar I am beginning to feel at home in
college and in command of the situation I am beginning in fact to
feel at home in the worldas though I really belonged to it and had
not just crept in on sufferance

I dont suppose you understand in the least what I am trying to say A
person important enough to be a Trustee cant appreciate the feelings
of a person unimportant enough to be a foundling

And now Daddy listen to this Whom do you think I am rooming with
Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton Its the truth We have
a study and three little bedroomsVOILA

Sallie and I decided last spring that we should like to room together
and Julia made up her mind to stay with Salliewhy I cant imagine
for they are not a bit alike but the Pendletons are naturally
conservative and inimical fine word to change Anyway here we are
Think of Jerusha Abbott late of the John Grier Home for Orphans
rooming with a Pendleton This is a democratic country

Sallie is running for class president and unless all signs fail she
is going to be elected Such an atmosphere of intrigue you should see
what politicians we are Oh I tell you Daddy when we women get our
rights you men will have to look alive in order to keep yours
Election comes next Saturday and were going to have a torchlight
procession in the evening no matter who wins

I am beginning chemistry a most unusual study Ive never seen
anything like it before Molecules and Atoms are the material
employed but Ill be in a position to discuss them more definitely
next month

I am also taking argumentation and logic

Also history of the whole world

Also plays of William Shakespeare

Also French

If this keeps up many years longer I shall become quite intelligent

I should rather have elected economics than French but I didnt dare
because I was afraid that unless I reelected French the Professor
would not let me passas it was I just managed to squeeze through the
June examination But I will say that my highschool preparation was
not very adequate

Theres one girl in the class who chatters away in French as fast as
she does in English She went abroad with her parents when she was a
child and spent three years in a convent school You can imagine how
bright she is compared with the rest of usirregular verbs are mere
playthings I wish my parents had chucked me into a French convent
when I was little instead of a foundling asylum Oh no I dont
either Because then maybe I should never have known you Id rather
know you than French

Goodbye Daddy I must call on Harriet Martin now and having
discussed the chemical situation casually drop a few thoughts on the
subject of our next president

 Yours in politics
 J Abbott




 17th October

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Supposing the swimming tank in the gymnasium were filled full of lemon
jelly could a person trying to swim manage to keep on top or would he
sink

We were having lemon jelly for dessert when the question came up We
discussed it heatedly for half an hour and its still unsettled
Sallie thinks that she could swim in it but I am perfectly sure that
the best swimmer in the world would sink Wouldnt it be funny to be
drowned in lemon jelly

Two other problems are engaging the attention of our table

1st What shape are the rooms in an octagon house Some of the girls
insist that theyre square but I think theyd have to be shaped like a
piece of pie Dont you

2nd Suppose there were a great big hollow sphere made of
lookingglass and you were sitting inside Where would it stop
reflecting your face and begin reflecting your back The more one
thinks about this problem the more puzzling it becomes You can see
with what deep philosophical reflection we engage our leisure

Did I ever tell you about the election It happened three weeks ago
but so fast do we live that three weeks is ancient history Sallie
was elected and we had a torchlight parade with transparencies saying
McBride for Ever and a band consisting of fourteen pieces three
mouth organs and eleven combs

Were very important persons now in 258 Julia and I come in for a
great deal of reflected glory Its quite a social strain to be living
in the same house with a president

Bonne nuit cher Daddy

 Acceptez mez compliments
 Tres respectueux
 je suis
 Votre Judy




 12th November

Dear DaddyLongLegs

We beat the Freshmen at basket ball yesterday Of course were
pleasedbut oh if we could only beat the juniors Id be willing to
be black and blue all over and stay in bed a week in a witchhazel
compress

Sallie has invited me to spend the Christmas vacation with her She
lives in Worcester Massachusetts Wasnt it nice of her I shall
love to go Ive never been in a private family in my life except at
Lock Willow and the Semples were grownup and old and dont count
But the McBrides have a houseful of children anyway two or three and
a mother and father and grandmother and an Angora cat Its a
perfectly complete family Packing your trunk and going away is more
fun than staying behind I am terribly excited at the prospect

Seventh hourI must run to rehearsal Im to be in the Thanksgiving
theatricals A prince in a tower with a velvet tunic and yellow curls
Isnt that a lark

 Yours
 J A




 Saturday

Do you want to know what I look like Heres a photograph of all three
that Leonora Fenton took

The light one who is laughing is Sallie and the tall one with her nose
in the air is Julia and the little one with the hair blowing across
her face is Judyshe is really more beautiful than that but the sun
was in her eyes




 STONE GATE
 WORCESTER MASS
 31st December

Dear DaddyLongLegs

I meant to write to you before and thank you for your Christmas cheque
but life in the McBride household is very absorbing and I dont seem
able to find two consecutive minutes to spend at a desk

I bought a new gownone that I didnt need but just wanted My
Christmas present this year is from DaddyLongLegs my family just
sent love

Ive been having the most beautiful vacation visiting Sallie She
lives in a big oldfashioned brick house with white trimmings set back
from the streetexactly the kind of house that I used to look at so
curiously when I was in the John Grier Home and wonder what it could
be like inside I never expected to see with my own eyesbut here I
am Everything is so comfortable and restful and homelike I walk from
room to room and drink in the furnishings

It is the most perfect house for children to be brought up in with
shadowy nooks for hide and seek and open fire places for popcorn and
an attic to romp in on rainy days and slippery banisters with a
comfortable flat knob at the bottom and a great big sunny kitchen and
a nice fat sunny cook who has lived in the family thirteen years and
always saves out a piece of dough for the children to bake Just the
sight of such a house makes you want to be a child all over again

And as for families I never dreamed they could be so nice Sallie
has a father and mother and grandmother and the sweetest
threeyearold baby sister all over curls and a mediumsized brother
who always forgets to wipe his feet and a big goodlooking brother
named Jimmie who is a junior at Princeton

We have the jolliest times at the tableeverybody laughs and jokes and
talks at once and we dont have to say grace beforehand Its a
relief not having to thank Somebody for every mouthful you eat I
dare say Im blasphemous but youd be too if youd offered as much
obligatory thanks as I have

Such a lot of things weve doneI cant begin to tell you about them
Mr McBride owns a factory and Christmas eve he had a tree for the
employees children It was in the long packingroom which was
decorated with evergreens and holly Jimmie McBride was dressed as
Santa Claus and Sallie and I helped him distribute the presents

Dear me Daddy but it was a funny sensation I felt as benevolent as
a Trustee of the John Grier home I kissed one sweet sticky little
boybut I dont think I patted any of them on the head

And two days after Christmas they gave a dance at their own house for
ME

It was the first really true ball I ever attendedcollege doesnt
count where we dance with girls I had a new white evening gown your
Christmas presentmany thanks and long white gloves and white satin
slippers The only drawback to my perfect utter absolute happiness
was the fact that Mrs Lippett couldnt see me leading the cotillion
with Jimmie McBride Tell her about it please the next time you
visit the J G H

 Yours ever
 Judy Abbott


PS Would you be terribly displeased Daddy if I didnt turn out to
be a Great Author after all but just a Plain Girl




 630 Saturday

Dear Daddy

We started to walk to town today but mercy how it poured I like
winter to be winter with snow instead of rain

Julias desirable uncle called again this afternoonand brought a
fivepound box of chocolates There are advantages you see about
rooming with Julia

Our innocent prattle appeared to amuse him and he waited for a later
train in order to take tea in the study We had an awful lot of
trouble getting permission Its hard enough entertaining fathers and
grandfathers but uncles are a step worse and as for brothers and
cousins they are next to impossible Julia had to swear that he was
her uncle before a notary public and then have the county clerks
certificate attached Dont I know a lot of law And even then I
doubt if we could have had our tea if the Dean had chanced to see how
youngish and goodlooking Uncle Jervis is

Anyway we had it with brown bread Swiss cheese sandwiches He helped
make them and then ate four I told him that I had spent last summer
at Lock Willow and we had a beautiful gossipy time about the Semples
and the horses and cows and chickens All the horses that he used to
know are dead except Grover who was a baby colt at the time of his
last visitand poor Grove now is so old he can just limp about the
pasture

He asked if they still kept doughnuts in a yellow crock with a blue
plate over it on the bottom shelf of the pantryand they do He
wanted to know if there was still a woodchucks hole under the pile of
rocks in the night pastureand there is Amasai caught a big fat
grey one there this summer the twentyfifth greatgrandson of the one
Master Jervis caught when he was a little boy

I called him Master Jervie to his face but he didnt appear to be
insulted Julia says she has never seen him so amiable hes usually
pretty unapproachable But Julia hasnt a bit of tact and men I
find require a great deal They purr if you rub them the right way
and spit if you dont That isnt a very elegant metaphor I mean it
figuratively

Were reading Marie Bashkirtseffs journal Isnt it amazing Listen
to this Last night I was seized by a fit of despair that found
utterance in moans and that finally drove me to throw the diningroom
clock into the sea

It makes me almost hope Im not a genius they must be very wearing to
have aboutand awfully destructive to the furniture

Mercy how it keeps Pouring We shall have to swim to chapel tonight

 Yours ever
 Judy




 20th Jan

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Did you ever have a sweet baby girl who was stolen from the cradle in
infancy

Maybe I am she If we were in a novel that would be the denouement
wouldnt it

Its really awfully queer not to know what one issort of exciting and
romantic There are such a lot of possibilities Maybe Im not
American lots of people arent I may be straight descended from the
ancient Romans or I may be a Vikings daughter or I may be the child
of a Russian exile and belong by rights in a Siberian prison or maybe
Im a GipsyI think perhaps I am I have a very WANDERING spirit
though I havent as yet had much chance to develop it

Do you know about that one scandalous blot in my career the time I ran
away from the asylum because they punished me for stealing cookies
Its down in the books free for any Trustee to read But really
Daddy what could you expect When you put a hungry little nineyear
girl in the pantry scouring knives with the cookie jar at her elbow
and go off and leave her alone and then suddenly pop in again
wouldnt you expect to find her a bit crumby And then when you jerk
her by the elbow and box her ears and make her leave the table when
the pudding comes and tell all the other children that its because
shes a thief wouldnt you expect her to run away

I only ran four miles They caught me and brought me back and every
day for a week I was tied like a naughty puppy to a stake in the back
yard while the other children were out at recess

Oh dear Theres the chapel bell and after chapel I have a committee
meeting Im sorry because I meant to write you a very entertaining
letter this time

 Auf wiedersehen
 Cher Daddy
 Pax tibi
 Judy


PS Theres one thing Im perfectly sure of Im not a Chinaman




 4th February

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Jimmie McBride has sent me a Princeton banner as big as one end of the
room I am very grateful to him for remembering me but I dont know
what on earth to do with it Sallie and Julia wont let me hang it up
our room this year is furnished in red and you can imagine what an
effect wed have if I added orange and black But its such nice
warm thick felt I hate to waste it Would it be very improper to
have it made into a bath robe My old one shrank when it was washed

Ive entirely omitted of late telling you what I am learning but
though you might not imagine it from my letters my time is exclusively
occupied with study Its a very bewildering matter to get educated in
five branches at once

The test of true scholarship says Chemistry Professor is a
painstaking passion for detail

Be careful not to keep your eyes glued to detail says History
Professor Stand far enough away to get a perspective of the whole

You can see with what nicety we have to trim our sails between
chemistry and history I like the historical method best If I say
that William the Conqueror came over in 1492 and Columbus discovered
America in 1100 or 1066 or whenever it was thats a mere detail that
the Professor overlooks It gives a feeling of security and
restfulness to the history recitation that is entirely lacking in
chemistry

Sixthhour bellI must go to the laboratory and look into a little
matter of acids and salts and alkalis Ive burned a hole as big as a
plate in the front of my chemistry apron with hydrochloric acid If
the theory worked I ought to be able to neutralize that hole with good
strong ammonia oughtnt I

Examinations next week but whos afraid

 Yours ever
 Judy




 5th March

Dear DaddyLongLegs

There is a March wind blowing and the sky is filled with heavy black
moving clouds The crows in the pine trees are making such a clamour
Its an intoxicating exhilarating CALLING noise You want to close
your books and be off over the hills to race with the wind

We had a paper chase last Saturday over five miles of squashy cross
country The fox composed of three girls and a bushel or so of
confetti started half an hour before the twentyseven hunters I was
one of the twentyseven eight dropped by the wayside we ended
nineteen The trail led over a hill through a cornfield and into a
swamp where we had to leap lightly from hummock to hummock of course
half of us went in ankle deep We kept losing the trail and we wasted
twentyfive minutes over that swamp Then up a hill through some woods
and in at a barn window The barn doors were all locked and the window
was up high and pretty small I dont call that fair do you

But we didnt go through we circumnavigated the barn and picked up the
trail where it issued by way of a low shed roof on to the top of a
fence The fox thought he had us there but we fooled him Then
straight away over two miles of rolling meadow and awfully hard to
follow for the confetti was getting sparse The rule is that it must
be at the most six feet apart but they were the longest six feet I
ever saw Finally after two hours of steady trotting we tracked
Monsieur Fox into the kitchen of Crystal Spring thats a farm where
the girls go in bob sleighs and hay wagons for chicken and waffle
suppers and we found the three foxes placidly eating milk and honey
and biscuits They hadnt thought we would get that far they were
expecting us to stick in the barn window

Both sides insist that they won I think we did dont you Because
we caught them before they got back to the campus Anyway all
nineteen of us settled like locusts over the furniture and clamoured
for honey There wasnt enough to go round but Mrs Crystal Spring
thats our pet name for her shes by rights a Johnson brought up a
jar of strawberry jam and a can of maple syrupjust made last
weekand three loaves of brown bread

We didnt get back to college till halfpast sixhalf an hour late for
dinnerand we went straight in without dressing and with perfectly
unimpaired appetites Then we all cut evening chapel the state of our
boots being enough of an excuse

I never told you about examinations I passed everything with the
utmost easeI know the secret now and am never going to fail again
I shant be able to graduate with honours though because of that
beastly Latin prose and geometry Freshman year But I dont care
Wots the hodds so long as youre appy Thats a quotation Ive
been reading the English classics

Speaking of classics have you ever read Hamlet If you havent do it
right off Its PERFECTLY CORKING Ive been hearing about
Shakespeare all my life but I had no idea he really wrote so well I
always suspected him of going largely on his reputation

I have a beautiful play that I invented a long time ago when I first
learned to read I put myself to sleep every night by pretending Im
the person the most important person in the book Im reading at the
moment

At present Im Opheliaand such a sensible Ophelia I keep Hamlet
amused all the time and pet him and scold him and make him wrap up his
throat when he has a cold Ive entirely cured him of being
melancholy The King and Queen are both deadan accident at sea no
funeral necessaryso Hamlet and I are ruling in Denmark without any
bother We have the kingdom working beautifully He takes care of the
governing and I look after the charities I have just founded some
firstclass orphan asylums If you or any of the other Trustees would
like to visit them I shall be pleased to show you through I think
you might find a great many helpful suggestions

 I remain sir
 Yours most graciously
 OPHELIA
 Queen of Denmark




 24th March
 maybe the 25th

Dear DaddyLongLegs

I dont believe I can be going to HeavenI am getting such a lot of
good things here it wouldnt be fair to get them hereafter too
Listen to what has happened

Jerusha Abbott has won the shortstory contest a twentyfive dollar
prize that the Monthly holds every year And shes a Sophomore The
contestants are mostly Seniors When I saw my name posted I couldnt
quite believe it was true Maybe I am going to be an author after all
I wish Mrs Lippett hadnt given me such a silly nameit sounds like
an authoress doesnt it

Also I have been chosen for the spring dramaticsAs You Like It out of
doors I am going to be Celia own cousin to Rosalind

And lastly Julia and Sallie and I are going to New York next Friday
to do some spring shopping and stay all night and go to the theatre the
next day with Master Jervie He invited us Julia is going to stay
at home with her family but Sallie and I are going to stop at the
Martha Washington Hotel Did you ever hear of anything so exciting
Ive never been in a hotel in my life nor in a theatre except once
when the Catholic Church had a festival and invited the orphans but
that wasnt a real play and it doesnt count

And what do you think were going to see Hamlet Think of that We
studied it for four weeks in Shakespeare class and I know it by heart

I am so excited over all these prospects that I can scarcely sleep

Goodbye Daddy

This is a very entertaining world

 Yours ever
 Judy


PS Ive just looked at the calendar Its the 28th

Another postscript

I saw a street car conductor today with one brown eye and one blue
Wouldnt he make a nice villain for a detective story




 7th April

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Mercy Isnt New York big Worcester is nothing to it Do you mean
to tell me that you actually live in all that confusion I dont
believe that I shall recover for months from the bewildering effect of
two days of it I cant begin to tell you all the amazing things Ive
seen I suppose you know though since you live there yourself

But arent the streets entertaining And the people And the shops
I never saw such lovely things as there are in the windows It makes
you want to devote your life to wearing clothes

Sallie and Julia and I went shopping together Saturday morning Julia
went into the very most gorgeous place I ever saw white and gold walls
and blue carpets and blue silk curtains and gilt chairs A perfectly
beautiful lady with yellow hair and a long black silk trailing gown
came to meet us with a welcoming smile I thought we were paying a
social call and started to shake hands but it seems we were only
buying hatsat least Julia was She sat down in front of a mirror and
tried on a dozen each lovelier than the last and bought the two
loveliest of all

I cant imagine any joy in life greater than sitting down in front of a
mirror and buying any hat you choose without having first to consider
the price Theres no doubt about it Daddy New York would rapidly
undermine this fine stoical character which the John Grier Home so
patiently built up

And after wed finished our shopping we met Master Jervie at Sherrys
I suppose youve been in Sherrys Picture that then picture the
diningroom of the John Grier Home with its oilclothcovered tables
and white crockery that you CANT break and woodenhandled knives and
forks and fancy the way I felt

I ate my fish with the wrong fork but the waiter very kindly gave me
another so that nobody noticed

And after luncheon we went to the theatreit was dazzling marvellous
unbelievableI dream about it every night

Isnt Shakespeare wonderful

Hamlet is so much better on the stage than when we analyze it in class
I appreciated it before but now dear me

I think if you dont mind that Id rather be an actress than a
writer Wouldnt you like me to leave college and go into a dramatic
school And then Ill send you a box for all my performances and
smile at you across the footlights Only wear a red rose in your
buttonhole please so Ill surely smile at the right man It would be
an awfully embarrassing mistake if I picked out the wrong one

We came back Saturday night and had our dinner in the train at little
tables with pink lamps and negro waiters I never heard of meals being
served in trains before and I inadvertently said so

Where on earth were you brought up said Julia to me

In a village said I meekly to Julia

But didnt you ever travel said she to me

Not till I came to college and then it was only a hundred and sixty
miles and we didnt eat said I to her

Shes getting quite interested in me because I say such funny things
I try hard not to but they do pop out when Im surprisedand Im
surprised most of the time Its a dizzying experience Daddy to pass
eighteen years in the John Grier Home and then suddenly to be plunged
into the WORLD

But Im getting acclimated I dont make such awful mistakes as I did
and I dont feel uncomfortable any more with the other girls I used
to squirm whenever people looked at me I felt as though they saw
right through my sham new clothes to the checked ginghams underneath
But Im not letting the ginghams bother me any more Sufficient unto
yesterday is the evil thereof

I forgot to tell you about our flowers Master Jervie gave us each a
big bunch of violets and liliesofthevalley Wasnt that sweet of
him I never used to care much for menjudging by Trusteesbut Im
changing my mind

Eleven pagesthis is a letter Have courage Im going to stop

 Yours always
 Judy




 10th April

Dear Mr RichMan

Heres your cheque for fifty dollars Thank you very much but I do
not feel that I can keep it My allowance is sufficient to afford all
of the hats that I need I am sorry that I wrote all that silly stuff
about the millinery shop its just that I had never seen anything like
it before

However I wasnt begging And I would rather not accept any more
charity than I have to

 Sincerely yours
 Jerusha Abbott




 11th April

Dearest Daddy

Will you please forgive me for the letter I wrote you yesterday After
I posted it I was sorry and tried to get it back but that beastly
mail clerk wouldnt give it back to me

Its the middle of the night now Ive been awake for hours thinking
what a Worm I amwhat a Thousandlegged Wormand thats the worst I
can say Ive closed the door very softly into the study so as not to
wake Julia and Sallie and am sitting up in bed writing to you on paper
torn out of my history notebook

I just wanted to tell you that I am sorry I was so impolite about your
cheque I know you meant it kindly and I think youre an old dear to
take so much trouble for such a silly thing as a hat I ought to have
returned it very much more graciously

But in any case I had to return it Its different with me than with
other girls They can take things naturally from people They have
fathers and brothers and aunts and uncles but I cant be on any such
relations with any one I like to pretend that you belong to me just
to play with the idea but of course I know you dont Im alone
reallywith my back to the wall fighting the worldand I get sort of
gaspy when I think about it I put it out of my mind and keep on
pretending but dont you see Daddy I cant accept any more money
than I have to because some day I shall be wanting to pay it back and
even as great an author as I intend to be wont be able to face a
PERFECTLY TREMENDOUS debt

Id love pretty hats and things but I mustnt mortgage the future to
pay for them

Youll forgive me wont you for being so rude I have an awful habit
of writing impulsively when I first think things and then posting the
letter beyond recall But if I sometimes seem thoughtless and
ungrateful I never mean it In my heart I thank you always for the
life and freedom and independence that you have given me My childhood
was just a long sullen stretch of revolt and now I am so happy every
moment of the day that I cant believe its true I feel like a
madeup heroine in a storybook

Its a quarter past two Im going to tiptoe out to post this off now
Youll receive it in the next mail after the other so you wont have a
very long time to think bad of me

 Good night Daddy
 I love you always
 Judy




 4th May

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Field Day last Saturday It was a very spectacular occasion First we
had a parade of all the classes with everybody dressed in white linen
the Seniors carrying blue and gold Japanese umbrellas and the juniors
white and yellow banners Our class had crimson balloonsvery
fetching especially as they were always getting loose and floating
offand the Freshmen wore green tissuepaper hats with long streamers
Also we had a band in blue uniforms hired from town Also about a
dozen funny people like clowns in a circus to keep the spectators
entertained between events

Julia was dressed as a fat country man with a linen duster and whiskers
and baggy umbrella Patsy Moriarty Patrici really Did you ever hear
such a name Mrs Lippett couldnt have done better who is tall and
thin was Julias wife in a absurd green bonnet over one ear Waves of
laughter followed them the whole length of the course Julia played
the part extremely well I never dreamed that a Pendleton could
display so much comedy spiritbegging Master Jervies pardon I dont
consider him a true Pendleton though any more than I consider you a
true Trustee

Sallie and I werent in the parade because we were entered for the
events And what do you think We both won At least in something
We tried for the running broad jump and lost but Sallie won the
polevaulting seven feet three inches and I won the fiftyyard sprint
eight seconds

I was pretty panting at the end but it was great fun with the whole
class waving balloons and cheering and yelling

 Whats the matter with Judy Abbott
 Shes all right
 Whos all right
 Judy Abbott


That Daddy is true fame Then trotting back to the dressing tent and
being rubbed down with alcohol and having a lemon to suck You see
were very professional Its a fine thing to win an event for your
class because the class that wins the most gets the athletic cup for
the year The Seniors won it this year with seven events to their
credit The athletic association gave a dinner in the gymnasium to all
of the winners We had fried softshell crabs and chocolate icecream
moulded in the shape of basket balls

I sat up half of last night reading Jane Eyre Are you old enough
Daddy to remember sixty years ago And if so did people talk that
way

The haughty Lady Blanche says to the footman Stop your chattering
knave and do my bidding Mr Rochester talks about the metal welkin
when he means the sky and as for the mad woman who laughs like a hyena
and sets fire to bed curtains and tears up wedding veils and
BITESits melodrama of the purest but just the same you read and
read and read I cant see how any girl could have written such a
book especially any girl who was brought up in a churchyard Theres
something about those Brontes that fascinates me Their books their
lives their spirit Where did they get it When I was reading about
little Janes troubles in the charity school I got so angry that I had
to go out and take a walk I understood exactly how she felt Having
known Mrs Lippett I could see Mr Brocklehurst

Dont be outraged Daddy I am not intimating that the John Grier Home
was like the Lowood Institute We had plenty to eat and plenty to
wear sufficient water to wash in and a furnace in the cellar But
there was one deadly likeness Our lives were absolutely monotonous
and uneventful Nothing nice ever happened except icecream on
Sundays and even that was regular In all the eighteen years I was
there I only had one adventurewhen the woodshed burned We had to
get up in the night and dress so as to be ready in case the house
should catch But it didnt catch and we went back to bed

Everybody likes a few surprises its a perfectly natural human
craving But I never had one until Mrs Lippett called me to the
office to tell me that Mr John Smith was going to send me to college
And then she broke the news so gradually that it just barely shocked me

You know Daddy I think that the most necessary quality for any person
to have is imagination It makes people able to put themselves in
other peoples places It makes them kind and sympathetic and
understanding It ought to be cultivated in children But the John
Grier Home instantly stamped out the slightest flicker that appeared
Duty was the one quality that was encouraged I dont think children
ought to know the meaning of the word its odious detestable They
ought to do everything from love

Wait until you see the orphan asylum that I am going to be the head of
Its my favourite play at night before I go to sleep I plan it out to
the littlest detailthe meals and clothes and study and amusements and
punishments for even my superior orphans are sometimes bad

But anyway they are going to be happy I think that every one no
matter how many troubles he may have when he grows up ought to have a
happy childhood to look back upon And if I ever have any children of
my own no matter how unhappy I may be I am not going to let them have
any cares until they grow up

There goes the chapel bellIll finish this letter sometime


 Thursday

When I came in from laboratory this afternoon I found a squirrel
sitting on the tea table helping himself to almonds These are the
kind of callers we entertain now that warm weather has come and the
windows stay open


 Saturday morning

Perhaps you think last night being Friday with no classes today that
I passed a nice quiet readable evening with the set of Stevenson that
I bought with my prize money But if so youve never attended a
girls college Daddy dear Six friends dropped in to make fudge and
one of them dropped the fudgewhile it was still liquidright in the
middle of our best rug We shall never be able to clean up the mess

I havent mentioned any lessons of late but we are still having them
every day Its sort of a relief though to get away from them and
discuss life in the largerather onesided discussions that you and I
hold but thats your own fault You are welcome to answer back any
time you choose

Ive been writing this letter off and on for three days and I fear by
now vous etes bien bored

 Goodbye nice Mr Man
 Judy

 2nd June

Dear DaddyLongLegs

You will never guess the nice thing that has happened

The McBrides have asked me to spend the summer at their camp in the
Adirondacks They belong to a sort of club on a lovely little lake in
the middle of the woods The different members have houses made of
logs dotted about among the trees and they go canoeing on the lake
and take long walks through trails to other camps and have dances once
a week in the club houseJimmie McBride is going to have a college
friend visiting him part of the summer so you see we shall have plenty
of men to dance with

Wasnt it sweet of Mrs McBride to ask me It appears that she liked
me when I was there for Christmas

Please excuse this being short It isnt a real letter its just to
let you know that Im disposed of for the summer

 Yours
 In a VERY contented frame of mind
 Judy




 5th June

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Your secretary man has just written to me saying that Mr Smith prefers
that I should not accept Mrs McBrides invitation but should return
to Lock Willow the same as last summer

Why why WHY Daddy

You dont understand about it Mrs McBride does want me really and
truly Im not the least bit of trouble in the house Im a help
They dont take up many servants and Sallie an I can do lots of useful
things Its a fine chance for me to learn housekeeping Every woman
ought to understand it and I only know asylumkeeping

There arent any girls our age at the camp and Mrs McBride wants me
for a companion for Sallie We are planning to do a lot of reading
together We are going to read all of the books for next years
English and sociology The Professor said it would be a great help if
we would get our reading finished in the summer and its so much
easier to remember it if we read together and talk it over

Just to live in the same house with Sallies mother is an education
Shes the most interesting entertaining companionable charming woman
in the world she knows everything Think how many summers Ive spent
with Mrs Lippett and how Ill appreciate the contrast You neednt be
afraid that Ill be crowding them for their house is made of rubber
When they have a lot of company they just sprinkle tents about in the
woods and turn the boys outside Its going to be such a nice healthy
summer exercising out of doors every minute Jimmie McBride is going
to teach me how to ride horseback and paddle a canoe and how to shoot
andoh lots of things I ought to know Its the kind of nice jolly
carefree time that Ive never had and I think every girl deserves it
once in her life Of course Ill do exactly as you say but please
PLEASE let me go Daddy Ive never wanted anything so much

This isnt Jerusha Abbott the future great author writing to you
Its just Judya girl



 9th June

Mr John Smith

SIR Yours of the 7th inst at hand In compliance with the
instructions received through your secretary I leave on Friday next to
spend the summer at Lock Willow Farm

I hope always to remain
 Miss Jerusha Abbott




 LOCK WILLOW FARM
 3rd August

Dear DaddyLongLegs

It has been nearly two months since I wrote which wasnt nice of me I
know but I havent loved you much this summeryou see Im being frank

You cant imagine how disappointed I was at having to give up the
McBrides camp Of course I know that youre my guardian and that I
have to regard your wishes in all matters but I couldnt see any
REASON It was so distinctly the best thing that could have happened
to me If I had been Daddy and you had been Judy I should have said
Bless you my child run along and have a good time see lots of new
people and learn lots of new things live out of doors and get strong
and well and rested for a year of hard work

But not at all Just a curt line from your secretary ordering me to
Lock Willow

Its the impersonality of your commands that hurts my feelings It
seems as though if you felt the tiniest little bit for me the way I
feel for you youd sometimes send me a message that youd written with
your own hand instead of those beastly typewritten secretarys notes
If there were the slightest hint that you cared Id do anything on
earth to please you

I know that I was to write nice long detailed letters without ever
expecting any answer Youre living up to your side of the
bargainIm being educatedand I suppose youre thinking Im not
living up to mine

But Daddy it is a hard bargain It is really Im so awfully
lonely You are the only person I have to care for and you are so
shadowy Youre just an imaginary man that Ive made upand probably
the real YOU isnt a bit like my imaginary YOU But you did once when
I was ill in the infirmary send me a message and now when I am
feeling awfully forgotten I get out your card and read it over

I dont think I am telling you at all what I started to say which was
this

Although my feelings are still hurt for it is very humiliating to be
picked up and moved about by an arbitrary peremptory unreasonable
omnipotent invisible Providence still when a man has been as kind
and generous and thoughtful as you have heretofore been towards me I
suppose he has a right to be an arbitrary peremptory unreasonable
invisible Providence if he chooses and soIll forgive you and be
cheerful again But I still dont enjoy getting Sallies letters about
the good times they are having in camp

Howeverwe will draw a veil over that and begin again

Ive been writing and writing this summer four short stories finished
and sent to four different magazines So you see Im trying to be an
author I have a workroom fixed in a corner of the attic where Master
Jervie used to have his rainyday playroom Its in a cool breezy
corner with two dormer windows and shaded by a maple tree with a
family of red squirrels living in a hole

Ill write a nicer letter in a few days and tell you all the farm news

We need rain

 Yours as ever
 Judy




 10th August

Mr DaddyLongLegs

SIR I address you from the second crotch in the willow tree by the
pool in the pasture Theres a frog croaking underneath a locust
singing overhead and two little devil downheads darting up and down
the trunk Ive been here for an hour its a very comfortable crotch
especially after being upholstered with two sofa cushions I came up
with a pen and tablet hoping to write an immortal short story but Ive
been having a dreadful time with my heroineI CANT make her behave as
I want her to behave so Ive abandoned her for the moment and am
writing to you Not much relief though for I cant make you behave
as I want you to either

If you are in that dreadful New York I wish I could send you some of
this lovely breezy sunshiny outlook The country is Heaven after a
week of rain

Speaking of Heavendo you remember Mr Kellogg that I told you about
last summerthe minister of the little white church at the Corners
Well the poor old soul is deadlast winter of pneumonia I went half
a dozen times to hear him preach and got very well acquainted with his
theology He believed to the end exactly the same things he started
with It seems to me that a man who can think straight along for
fortyseven years without changing a single idea ought to be kept in a
cabinet as a curiosity I hope he is enjoying his harp and golden
crown he was so perfectly sure of finding them Theres a new young
man very consequential in his place The congregation is pretty
dubious especially the faction led by Deacon Cummings It looks as
though there was going to be an awful split in the church We dont
care for innovations in religion in this neighbourhood

During our week of rain I sat up in the attic and had an orgy of
readingStevenson mostly He himself is more entertaining than any
of the characters in his books I dare say he made himself into the
kind of hero that would look well in print Dont you think it was
perfect of him to spend all the ten thousand dollars his father left
for a yacht and go sailing off to the South Seas He lived up to his
adventurous creed If my father had left me ten thousand dollars Id
do it too The thought of Vailima makes me wild I want to see the
tropics I want to see the whole world I am going to be a great
author or artist or actress or playwrightor whatever sort of a
great person I turn out to be I have a terrible wanderthirst the
very sight of a map makes me want to put on my hat and take an umbrella
and start I shall see before I die the palms and temples of the
South



 Thursday evening at twilight
 sitting on the doorstep

Very hard to get any news into this letter Judy is becoming so
philosophical of late that she wishes to discourse largely of the
world in general instead of descending to the trivial details of daily
life But if you MUST have news here it is

Our nine young pigs waded across the brook and ran away last Tuesday
and only eight came back We dont want to accuse anyone unjustly but
we suspect that Widow Dowd has one more than she ought to have

Mr Weaver has painted his barn and his two silos a bright pumpkin
yellowa very ugly colour but he says it will wear

The Brewers have company this week Mrs Brewers sister and two nieces
from Ohio

One of our Rhode Island Reds only brought off three chicks out of
fifteen eggs We cant imagine what was the trouble Rhode island
Reds in my opinion are a very inferior breed I prefer Buff
Orpingtons

The new clerk in the post office at Bonnyrigg Four Corners drank every
drop of Jamaica ginger they had in stockseven dollars worthbefore
he was discovered

Old Ira Hatch has rheumatism and cant work any more he never saved
his money when he was earning good wages so now he has to live on the
town

Theres to be an icecream social at the schoolhouse next Saturday
evening Come and bring your families

I have a new hat that I bought for twentyfive cents at the post
office This is my latest portrait on my way to rake the hay

Its getting too dark to see anyway the news is all used up

 Good night
 Judy




 Friday

Good morning Here is some news What do you think Youd never
never never guess whos coming to Lock Willow A letter to Mrs
Semple from Mr Pendleton Hes motoring through the Berkshires and
is tired and wants to rest on a nice quiet farmif he climbs out at
her doorstep some night will she have a room ready for him Maybe
hell stay one week or maybe two or maybe three hell see how
restful it is when he gets here

Such a flutter as we are in The whole house is being cleaned and all
the curtains washed I am driving to the Corners this morning to get
some new oilcloth for the entry and two cans of brown floor paint for
the hall and back stairs Mrs Dowd is engaged to come tomorrow to
wash the windows in the exigency of the moment we waive our
suspicions in regard to the piglet You might think from this account
of our activities that the house was not already immaculate but I
assure you it was Whatever Mrs Semples limitations she is a
HOUSEKEEPER

But isnt it just like a man Daddy He doesnt give the remotest hint
as to whether he will land on the doorstep today or two weeks from
today We shall live in a perpetual breathlessness until he comesand
if he doesnt hurry the cleaning may all have to be done over again

Theres Amasai waiting below with the buckboard and Grover I drive
alonebut if you could see old Grove you wouldnt be worried as to my
safety

With my hand on my heartfarewell

 Judy


PS Isnt that a nice ending I got it out of Stevensons letters




 Saturday

Good morning again I didnt get this ENVELOPED yesterday before the
postman came so Ill add some more We have one mail a day at twelve
oclock Rural delivery is a blessing to the farmers Our postman not
only delivers letters but he runs errands for us in town at five
cents an errand Yesterday he brought me some shoestrings and a jar
of cold cream I sunburned all the skin off my nose before I got my new
hat and a blue Windsor tie and a bottle of blacking all for ten cents
That was an unusual bargain owing to the largeness of my order

Also he tells us what is happening in the Great World Several people
on the route take daily papers and he reads them as he jogs along and
repeats the news to the ones who dont subscribe So in case a war
breaks out between the United States and Japan or the president is
assassinated or Mr Rockefeller leaves a million dollars to the John
Grier Home you neednt bother to write Ill hear it anyway

No sign yet of Master Jervie But you should see how clean our house
isand with what anxiety we wipe our feet before we step in

I hope hell come soon I am longing for someone to talk to Mrs
Semple to tell you the truth gets rather monotonous She never lets
ideas interrupt the easy flow of her conversation Its a funny thing
about the people here Their world is just this single hilltop They
are not a bit universal if you know what I mean Its exactly the
same as at the John Grier Home Our ideas there were bounded by the
four sides of the iron fence only I didnt mind it so much because I
was younger and was so awfully busy By the time Id got all my beds
made and my babies faces washed and had gone to school and come home
and had washed their faces again and darned their stockings and mended
Freddie Perkinss trousers he tore them every day of his life and
learned my lessons in betweenI was ready to go to bed and I didnt
notice any lack of social intercourse But after two years in a
conversational college I do miss it and I shall be glad to see
somebody who speaks my language

I really believe Ive finished Daddy Nothing else occurs to me at
the momentIll try to write a longer letter next time

 Yours always
 Judy


PS The lettuce hasnt done at all well this year It was so dry
early in the season




 25th August

Well Daddy Master Jervies here And such a nice time as were
having At least I am and I think he is toohe has been here ten
days and he doesnt show any signs of going The way Mrs Semple
pampers that man is scandalous If she indulged him as much when he
was a baby I dont know how he ever turned out so well

He and I eat at a little table set on the side porch or sometimes
under the trees orwhen it rains or is coldin the best parlour He
just picks out the spot he wants to eat in and Carrie trots after him
with the table Then if it has been an awful nuisance and she has had
to carry the dishes very far she finds a dollar under the sugar bowl

He is an awfully companionable sort of man though you would never
believe it to see him casually he looks at first glance like a true
Pendleton but he isnt in the least He is just as simple and
unaffected and sweet as he can bethat seems a funny way to describe a
man but its true Hes extremely nice with the farmers around here
he meets them in a sort of mantoman fashion that disarms them
immediately They were very suspicious at first They didnt care for
his clothes And I will say that his clothes are rather amazing He
wears knickerbockers and pleated jackets and white flannels and riding
clothes with puffed trousers Whenever he comes down in anything new
Mrs Semple beaming with pride walks around and views him from every
angle and urges him to be careful where he sits down she is so afraid
he will pick up some dust It bores him dreadfully Hes always
saying to her

Run along Lizzie and tend to your work You cant boss me any
longer Ive grown up

Its awfully funny to think of that great big longlegged man hes
nearly as longlegged as you Daddy ever sitting in Mrs Semples lap
and having his face washed Particularly funny when you see her lap
She has two laps now and three chins But he says that once she was
thin and wiry and spry and could run faster than he

Such a lot of adventures were having Weve explored the country for
miles and Ive learned to fish with funny little flies made of
feathers Also to shoot with a rifle and a revolver Also to ride
horsebacktheres an astonishing amount of life in old Grove We fed
him on oats for three days and he shied at a calf and almost ran away
with me

 Wednesday

We climbed Sky Hill Monday afternoon Thats a mountain near here not
an awfully high mountain perhapsno snow on the summitbut at least
you are pretty breathless when you reach the top The lower slopes are
covered with woods but the top is just piled rocks and open moor We
stayed up for the sunset and built a fire and cooked our supper
Master Jervie did the cooking he said he knew how better than me and
he did too because hes used to camping Then we came down by
moonlight and when we reached the wood trail where it was dark by
the light of an electric bulb that he had in his pocket It was such
fun He laughed and joked all the way and talked about interesting
things Hes read all the books Ive ever read and a lot of others
besides Its astonishing how many different things he knows

We went for a long tramp this morning and got caught in a storm Our
clothes were drenched before we reached home but our spirits not even
damp You should have seen Mrs Semples face when we dripped into her
kitchen

Oh Master JervieMiss Judy You are soaked through Dear Dear
What shall I do That nice new coat is perfectly ruined

She was awfully funny you would have thought that we were ten years
old and she a distracted mother I was afraid for a while that we
werent going to get any jam for tea



 Saturday

I started this letter ages ago but I havent had a second to finish it

Isnt this a nice thought from Stevenson


 The world is so full of a number of things
 I am sure we should all be as happy as kings


Its true you know The world is full of happiness and plenty to go
round if you are only willing to take the kind that comes your way
The whole secret is in being PLIABLE In the country especially
there are such a lot of entertaining things I can walk over
everybodys land and look at everybodys view and dabble in
everybodys brook and enjoy it just as much as though I owned the
landand with no taxes to pay

Its Sunday night now about eleven oclock and I am supposed to be
getting some beauty sleep but I had black coffee for dinner sono
beauty sleep for me

This morning said Mrs Semple to Mr Pendleton with a very determined
accent

We have to leave here at a quarter past ten in order to get to church
by eleven

Very well Lizzie said Master Jervie you have the buggy ready and
if Im not dressed just go on without waiting Well wait said
she

As you please said he only dont keep the horses standing too
long

Then while she was dressing he told Carrie to pack up a lunch and he
told me to scramble into my walking clothes and we slipped out the
back way and went fishing

It discommoded the household dreadfully because Lock Willow of a
Sunday dines at two But he ordered dinner at sevenhe orders meals
whenever he chooses you would think the place were a restaurantand
that kept Carrie and Amasai from going driving But he said it was all
the better because it wasnt proper for them to go driving without a
chaperon and anyway he wanted the horses himself to take me driving
Did you ever hear anything so funny

And poor Mrs Semple believes that people who go fishing on Sundays go
afterwards to a sizzling hot hell She is awfully troubled to think
that she didnt train him better when he was small and helpless and she
had the chance Besidesshe wished to show him off in church

Anyway we had our fishing he caught four little ones and we cooked
them on a campfire for lunch They kept falling off our spiked sticks
into the fire so they tasted a little ashy but we ate them We got
home at four and went driving at five and had dinner at seven and at
ten I was sent to bed and here I am writing to you

I am getting a little sleepy though

 Good night


Here is a picture of the one fish I caught




Ship Ahoy Capn LongLegs

Avast Belay Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum Guess what Im
reading Our conversation these past two days has been nautical and
piratical Isnt Treasure Island fun Did you ever read it or wasnt
it written when you were a boy Stevenson only got thirty pounds for
the serial rightsI dont believe it pays to be a great author Maybe
Ill be a schoolteacher

Excuse me for filling my letters so full of Stevenson my mind is very
much engaged with him at present He comprises Lock Willows library

Ive been writing this letter for two weeks and I think its about
long enough Never say Daddy that I dont give details I wish you
were here too wed all have such a jolly time together I like my
different friends to know each other I wanted to ask Mr Pendleton if
he knew you in New YorkI should think he might you must move in
about the same exalted social circles and you are both interested in
reforms and thingsbut I couldnt for I dont know your real name

Its the silliest thing I ever heard of not to know your name Mrs
Lippett warned me that you were eccentric I should think so

 Affectionately
 Judy


PS On reading this over I find that it isnt all Stevenson There
are one or two glancing references to Master Jervie




 10th September

Dear Daddy

He has gone and we are missing him When you get accustomed to people
or places or ways of living and then have them snatched away it does
leave an awfully empty gnawing sort of sensation Im finding Mrs
Semples conversation pretty unseasoned food

College opens in two weeks and I shall be glad to begin work again I
have worked quite a lot this summer thoughsix short stories and seven
poems Those I sent to the magazines all came back with the most
courteous promptitude But I dont mind Its good practice Master
Jervie read themhe brought in the post so I couldnt help his
knowingand he said they were DREADFUL They showed that I didnt
have the slightest idea of what I was talking about Master Jervie
doesnt let politeness interfere with truth But the last one I
didjust a little sketch laid in collegehe said wasnt bad and he
had it typewritten and I sent it to a magazine Theyve had it two
weeks maybe theyre thinking it over

You should see the sky Theres the queerest orangecoloured light
over everything Were going to have a storm


It commenced just that moment with tremendously big drops and all the
shutters banging I had to run to close the windows while Carrie flew
to the attic with an armful of milk pans to put under the places where
the roof leaks and then just as I was resuming my pen I remembered
that Id left a cushion and rug and hat and Matthew Arnolds poems
under a tree in the orchard so I dashed out to get them all quite
soaked The red cover of the poems had run into the inside Dover
Beach in the future will be washed by pink waves

A storm is awfully disturbing in the country You are always having to
think of so many things that are out of doors and getting spoiled

 Thursday

Daddy Daddy What do you think The postman has just come with two
letters

1st My story is accepted 50

ALORS Im an AUTHOR

2nd A letter from the college secretary Im to have a scholarship
for two years that will cover board and tuition It was founded for
marked proficiency in English with general excellency in other lines
And Ive won it I applied for it before I left but I didnt have an
idea Id get it on account of my Freshman bad work in maths and Latin
But it seems Ive made it up I am awfully glad Daddy because now I
wont be such a burden to you The monthly allowance will be all Ill
need and maybe I can earn that with writing or tutoring or something

Im LONGING to go back and begin work

 Yours ever

 26th September

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Back at college again and an upper classman Our study is better than
ever this yearfaces the South with two huge windows and oh so
furnished Julia with an unlimited allowance arrived two days early
and was attacked with a fever for settling

We have new wall paper and oriental rugs and mahogany chairsnot
painted mahogany which made us sufficiently happy last year but real
Its very gorgeous but I dont feel as though I belonged in it Im
nervous all the time for fear Ill get an ink spot in the wrong place

And Daddy I found your letter waiting for mepardonI mean your
secretarys

Will you kindly convey to me a comprehensible reason why I should not
accept that scholarship I dont understand your objection in the
least But anyway it wont do the slightest good for you to object
for Ive already accepted it and I am not going to change That sounds
a little impertinent but I dont mean it so

I suppose you feel that when you set out to educate me youd like to
finish the work and put a neat period in the shape of a diploma at
the end

But look at it just a second from my point of view I shall owe my
education to you just as much as though I let you pay for the whole of
it but I wont be quite so much indebted I know that you dont want
me to return the money but nevertheless I am going to want to do it
if I possibly can and winning this scholarship makes it so much
easier I was expecting to spend the rest of my life in paying my
debts but now I shall only have to spend onehalf of the rest of it

I hope you understand my position and wont be cross The allowance I
shall still most gratefully accept It requires an allowance to live
up to Julia and her furniture I wish that she had been reared to
simpler tastes or else that she were not my roommate

This isnt much of a letter I meant to have written a lotbut Ive
been hemming four window curtains and three portieres Im glad you
cant see the length of the stitches and polishing a brass desk set
with tooth powder very uphill work and sawing off picture wire with
manicure scissors and unpacking four boxes of books and putting away
two trunkfuls of clothes it doesnt seem believable that Jerusha
Abbott owns two trunks full of clothes but she does and welcoming
back fifty dear friends in between

Opening day is a joyous occasion

Good night Daddy dear and dont be annoyed because your chick is
wanting to scratch for herself Shes growing up into an awfully
energetic little henwith a very determined cluck and lots of
beautiful feathers all due to you

 Affectionately
 Judy




 30th September

Dear Daddy

Are you still harping on that scholarship I never knew a man so
obstinate and stubborn and unreasonable and tenacious and
bulldoggish and unabletoseeotherpeoplespointofview as you

You prefer that I should not be accepting favours from strangers

StrangersAnd what are you pray

Is there anyone in the world that I know less I shouldnt recognize
you if I met you in the street Now you see if you had been a sane
sensible person and had written nice cheering fatherly letters to your
little Judy and had come occasionally and patted her on the head and
had said you were glad she was such a good girlThen perhaps she
wouldnt have flouted you in your old age but would have obeyed your
slightest wish like the dutiful daughter she was meant to be

Strangers indeed You live in a glass house Mr Smith

And besides this isnt a favour its like a prizeI earned it by
hard work If nobody had been good enough in English the committee
wouldnt have awarded the scholarship some years they dont Also
But whats the use of arguing with a man You belong Mr Smith to a
sex devoid of a sense of logic To bring a man into line there are
just two methods one must either coax or be disagreeable I scorn to
coax men for what I wish Therefore I must be disagreeable

I refuse sir to give up the scholarship and if you make any more
fuss I wont accept the monthly allowance either but will wear myself
into a nervous wreck tutoring stupid Freshmen

That is my ultimatum

And listenI have a further thought Since you are so afraid that by
taking this scholarship I am depriving someone else of an education I
know a way out You can apply the money that you would have spent for
me towards educating some other little girl from the John Grier Home
Dont you think thats a nice idea Only Daddy EDUCATE the new girl
as much as you choose but please dont LIKE her any better than me

I trust that your secretary wont be hurt because I pay so little
attention to the suggestions offered in his letter but I cant help it
if he is Hes a spoiled child Daddy Ive meekly given in to his
whims heretofore but this time I intend to be FIRM

Yours
 With a mind
 Completely and Irrevocably and

 9th November

Dear DaddyLongLegs

I started down town today to buy a bottle of shoe blacking and some
collars and the material for a new blouse and a jar of violet cream and
a cake of Castile soapall very necessary I couldnt be happy another
day without themand when I tried to pay the car fare I found that I
had left my purse in the pocket of my other coat So I had to get out
and take the next car and was late for gymnasium

Its a dreadful thing to have no memory and two coats

Julia Pendleton has invited me to visit her for the Christmas holidays
How does that strike you Mr Smith Fancy Jerusha Abbott of the John
Grier Home sitting at the tables of the rich I dont know why Julia
wants meshe seems to be getting quite attached to me of late I
should to tell the truth very much prefer going to Sallies but
Julia asked me first so if I go anywhere it must be to New York
instead of to Worcester Im rather awed at the prospect of meeting
Pendletons EN MASSE and also Id have to get a lot of new clothesso
Daddy dear if you write that you would prefer having me remain quietly
at college I will bow to your wishes with my usual sweet docility

Im engaged at odd moments with the Life and Letters of Thomas
Huxleyit makes nice light reading to pick up between times Do you
know what an archaeopteryx is Its a bird And a stereognathus Im
not sure myself but I think its a missing link like a bird with
teeth or a lizard with wings No it isnt either Ive just looked in
the book Its a mesozoic mammal

Ive elected economics this yearvery illuminating subject When I
finish that Im going to take Charity and Reform then Mr Trustee
Ill know just how an orphan asylum ought to be run Dont you think
Id make an admirable voter if I had my rights I was twentyone last
week This is an awfully wasteful country to throw away such an
honest educated conscientious intelligent citizen as I would be

 Yours always
 Judy




 7th December

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Thank you for permission to visit JuliaI take it that silence means
consent

Such a social whirl as weve been having The Founders dance came
last weekthis was the first year that any of us could attend only
upper classmen being allowed

I invited Jimmie McBride and Sallie invited his roommate at
Princeton who visited them last summer at their campan awfully nice
man with red hairand Julia invited a man from New York not very
exciting but socially irreproachable He is connected with the De la
Mater Chichesters Perhaps that means something to you It doesnt
illuminate me to any extent

Howeverour guests came Friday afternoon in time for tea in the senior
corridor and then dashed down to the hotel for dinner The hotel was
so full that they slept in rows on the billiard tables they say
Jimmie McBride says that the next time he is bidden to a social event
in this college he is going to bring one of their Adirondack tents and
pitch it on the campus

At seventhirty they came back for the Presidents reception and dance
Our functions commence early We had the mens cards all made out
ahead of time and after every dance wed leave them in groups under
the letter that stood for their names so that they could be readily
found by their next partners Jimmie McBride for example would stand
patiently under M until he was claimed At least he ought to have
stood patiently but he kept wandering off and getting mixed with Rs
and Ss and all sorts of letters I found him a very difficult
guest he was sulky because he had only three dances with me He said
he was bashful about dancing with girls he didnt know

The next morning we had a glee club concertand who do you think wrote
the funny new song composed for the occasion Its the truth She
did Oh I tell you Daddy your little foundling is getting to be
quite a prominent person

Anyway our gay two days were great fun and I think the men enjoyed
it Some of them were awfully perturbed at first at the prospect of
facing one thousand girls but they got acclimated very quickly Our
two Princeton men had a beautiful timeat least they politely said
they had and theyve invited us to their dance next spring Weve
accepted so please dont object Daddy dear

Julia and Sallie and I all had new dresses Do you want to hear about
them Julias was cream satin and gold embroidery and she wore purple
orchids It was a DREAM and came from Paris and cost a million
dollars

Sallies was pale blue trimmed with Persian embroidery and went
beautifully with red hair It didnt cost quite a million but was
just as effective as Julias

Mine was pale pink crepe de chine trimmed with ecru lace and rose
satin And I carried crimson roses which J McB sent Sallie having
told him what colour to get And we all had satin slippers and silk
stockings and chiffon scarfs to match

You must be deeply impressed by these millinery details

One cant help thinking Daddy what a colourless life a man is forced
to lead when one reflects that chiffon and Venetian point and hand
embroidery and Irish crochet are to him mere empty words Whereas a
womanwhether she is interested in babies or microbes or husbands or
poetry or servants or parallelograms or gardens or Plato or bridgeis
fundamentally and always interested in clothes

Its the one touch of nature that makes the whole world kin That
isnt original I got it out of one of Shakespeares plays

However to resume Do you want me to tell you a secret that Ive
lately discovered And will you promise not to think me vain Then
listen

Im pretty

I am really Id be an awful idiot not to know it with three
lookingglasses in the room

 A Friend


PS This is one of those wicked anonymous letters you read about in
novels



 20th December

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Ive just a moment because I must attend two classes pack a trunk and
a suitcase and catch the fouroclock trainbut I couldnt go
without sending a word to let you know how much I appreciate my
Christmas box

I love the furs and the necklace and the Liberty scarf and the gloves
and handkerchiefs and books and purseand most of all I love you But
Daddy you have no business to spoil me this way Im only humanand
a girl at that How can I keep my mind sternly fixed on a studious
career when you deflect me with such worldly frivolities

I have strong suspicions now as to which one of the John Grier Trustees
used to give the Christmas tree and the Sunday icecream He was
nameless but by his works I know him You deserve to be happy for all
the good things you do

Goodbye and a very merry Christmas

 Yours always
 Judy


PS I am sending a slight token too Do you think you would like her
if you knew her




 11th January

I meant to write to you from the city Daddy but New York is an
engrossing place

I had an interestingand illuminatingtime but Im glad I dont
belong to such a family I should truly rather have the John Grier
Home for a background Whatever the drawbacks of my bringing up there
was at least no pretence about it I know now what people mean when
they say they are weighed down by Things The material atmosphere of
that house was crushing I didnt draw a deep breath until I was on an
express train coming back All the furniture was carved and
upholstered and gorgeous the people I met were beautifully dressed and
lowvoiced and wellbred but its the truth Daddy I never heard one
word of real talk from the time we arrived until we left I dont
think an idea ever entered the front door

Mrs Pendleton never thinks of anything but jewels and dressmakers and
social engagements She did seem a different kind of mother from Mrs
McBride If I ever marry and have a family Im going to make them as
exactly like the McBrides as I can Not for all the money in the world
would I ever let any children of mine develop into Pendletons Maybe
it isnt polite to criticize people youve been visiting If it isnt
please excuse This is very confidential between you and me

I only saw Master Jervie once when he called at tea time and then I
didnt have a chance to speak to him alone It was really
disappointing after our nice time last summer I dont think he cares
much for his relativesand I am sure they dont care much for him
Julias mother says hes unbalanced Hes a Socialistexcept thank
Heaven he doesnt let his hair grow and wear red ties She cant
imagine where he picked up his queer ideas the family have been Church
of England for generations He throws away his money on every sort of
crazy reform instead of spending it on such sensible things as yachts
and automobiles and polo ponies He does buy candy with it though He
sent Julia and me each a box for Christmas

You know I think Ill be a Socialist too You wouldnt mind would
you Daddy Theyre quite different from Anarchists they dont
believe in blowing people up Probably I am one by rights I belong to
the proletariat I havent determined yet just which kind I am going
to be I will look into the subject over Sunday and declare my
principles in my next

Ive seen loads of theatres and hotels and beautiful houses My mind
is a confused jumble of onyx and gilding and mosaic floors and palms
Im still pretty breathless but I am glad to get back to college and my
booksI believe that I really am a student this atmosphere of
academic calm I find more bracing than New York College is a very
satisfying sort of life the books and study and regular classes keep
you alive mentally and then when your mind gets tired you have the
gymnasium and outdoor athletics and always plenty of congenial friends
who are thinking about the same things you are We spend a whole
evening in nothing but talktalktalkand go to bed with a very
uplifted feeling as though we had settled permanently some pressing
world problems And filling in every crevice there is always such a
lot of nonsensejust silly jokes about the little things that come up
but very satisfying We do appreciate our own witticisms

It isnt the great big pleasures that count the most its making a
great deal out of the little onesIve discovered the true secret of
happiness Daddy and that is to live in the now Not to be for ever
regretting the past or anticipating the future but to get the most
that you can out of this very instant Its like farming You can
have extensive farming and intensive farming well I am going to have
intensive living after this Im going to enjoy every second and Im
going to KNOW Im enjoying it while Im enjoying it Most people dont
live they just race They are trying to reach some goal far away on
the horizon and in the heat of the going they get so breathless and
panting that they lose all sight of the beautiful tranquil country
they are passing through and then the first thing they know they are
old and worn out and it doesnt make any difference whether theyve
reached the goal or not Ive decided to sit down by the way and pile
up a lot of little happinesses even if I never become a Great Author
Did you ever know such a philosopheress as I am developing into

 Yours ever
 Judy

PS Its raining cats and dogs tonight Two puppies and a kitten have
just landed on the windowsill




Dear Comrade

Hooray Im a Fabian

Thats a Socialist whos willing to wait We dont want the social
revolution to come tomorrow morning it would be too upsetting We
want it to come very gradually in the distant future when we shall all
be prepared and able to sustain the shock

In the meantime we must be getting ready by instituting industrial
educational and orphan asylum reforms

 Yours with fraternal love

 11th February
Dear DLL

Dont be insulted because this is so short It isnt a letter its
just a LINE to say that Im going to write a letter pretty soon when
examinations are over It is not only necessary that I pass but pass
WELL I have a scholarship to live up to

 Yours studying hard

 5th March

Dear DaddyLongLegs

President Cuyler made a speech this evening about the modern generation
being flippant and superficial He says that we are losing the old
ideals of earnest endeavour and true scholarship and particularly is
this fallingoff noticeable in our disrespectful attitude towards
organized authority We no longer pay a seemly deference to our
superiors

I came away from chapel very sober

Am I too familiar Daddy Ought I to treat you with more dignity and
aloofnessYes Im sure I ought Ill begin again

My Dear Mr Smith

You will be pleased to hear that I passed successfully my midyear
examinations and am now commencing work in the new semester I am
leaving chemistryhaving completed the course in qualitative
analysisand am entering upon the study of biology I approach this
subject with some hesitation as I understand that we dissect
angleworms and frogs

An extremely interesting and valuable lecture was given in the chapel
last week upon Roman Remains in Southern France I have never listened
to a more illuminating exposition of the subject

We are reading Wordsworths Tintern Abbey in connection with our course
in English Literature What an exquisite work it is and how
adequately it embodies his conceptions of Pantheism The Romantic
movement of the early part of the last century exemplified in the
works of such poets as Shelley Byron Keats and Wordsworth appeals
to me very much more than the Classical period that preceded it
Speaking of poetry have you ever read that charming little thing of
Tennysons called Locksley Hall

I am attending gymnasium very regularly of late A proctor system has
been devised and failure to comply with the rules causes a great deal
of inconvenience The gymnasium is equipped with a very beautiful
swimming tank of cement and marble the gift of a former graduate My
roommate Miss McBride has given me her bathingsuit it shrank so
that she can no longer wear it and I am about to begin swimming
lessons

We had delicious pink icecream for dessert last night Only vegetable
dyes are used in colouring the food The college is very much opposed
both from aesthetic and hygienic motives to the use of aniline dyes

The weather of late has been idealbright sunshine and clouds
interspersed with a few welcome snowstorms I and my companions have
enjoyed our walks to and from classesparticularly from

Trusting my dear Mr Smith that this will find you in your usual good
health

 I remain
 Most cordially yours
 Jerusha Abbott




 24th April

Dear Daddy

Spring has come again You should see how lovely the campus is I
think you might come and look at it for yourself Master Jervie
dropped in again last Fridaybut he chose a most unpropitious time
for Sallie and Julia and I were just running to catch a train And
where do you think we were going To Princeton to attend a dance and
a ball game if you please I didnt ask you if I might go because I
had a feeling that your secretary would say no But it was entirely
regular we had leaveofabsence from college and Mrs McBride
chaperoned us We had a charming timebut I shall have to omit
details they are too many and complicated


 Saturday

Up before dawn The night watchman called ussix of usand we made
coffee in a chafing dish you never saw so many grounds and walked
two miles to the top of One Tree Hill to see the sun rise We had to
scramble up the last slope The sun almost beat us And perhaps you
think we didnt bring back appetites to breakfast

Dear me Daddy I seem to have a very ejaculatory style today this
page is peppered with exclamations

I meant to have written a lot about the budding trees and the new
cinder path in the athletic field and the awful lesson we have in
biology for tomorrow and the new canoes on the lake and Catherine
Prentiss who has pneumonia and Prexys Angora kitten that strayed from
home and has been boarding in Fergussen Hall for two weeks until a
chambermaid reported it and about my three new dresseswhite and pink
and blue polka dots with a hat to matchbut I am too sleepy I am
always making this an excuse am I not But a girls college is a busy
place and we do get tired by the end of the day Particularly when the
day begins at dawn

 Affectionately
 Judy




 15th May

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Is it good manners when you get into a car just to stare straight ahead
and not see anybody else

A very beautiful lady in a very beautiful velvet dress got into the car
today and without the slightest expression sat for fifteen minutes and
looked at a sign advertising suspenders It doesnt seem polite to
ignore everybody else as though you were the only important person
present Anyway you miss a lot While she was absorbing that silly
sign I was studying a whole car full of interesting human beings

The accompanying illustration is hereby reproduced for the first time
It looks like a spider on the end of a string but it isnt at all
its a picture of me learning to swim in the tank in the gymnasium

The instructor hooks a rope into a ring in the back of my belt and
runs it through a pulley in the ceiling It would be a beautiful
system if one had perfect confidence in the probity of ones
instructor Im always afraid though that she will let the rope get
slack so I keep one anxious eye on her and swim with the other and
with this divided interest I do not make the progress that I otherwise
might

Very miscellaneous weather were having of late It was raining when I
commenced and now the sun is shining Sallie and I are going out to
play tennisthereby gaining exemption from Gym


 A week later

I should have finished this letter long ago but I didnt You dont
mind do you Daddy if Im not very regular I really do love to
write to you it gives me such a respectable feeling of having some
family Would you like me to tell you something You are not the only
man to whom I write letters There are two others I have been
receiving beautiful long letters this winter from Master Jervie with
typewritten envelopes so Julia wont recognize the writing Did you
ever hear anything so shocking And every week or so a very scrawly
epistle usually on yellow tablet paper arrives from Princeton All
of which I answer with businesslike promptness So you seeI am not
so different from other girlsI get letters too

Did I tell you that I have been elected a member of the Senior Dramatic
Club Very recherche organization Only seventyfive members out of
one thousand Do you think as a consistent Socialist that I ought to
belong

What do you suppose is at present engaging my attention in sociology
I am writing figurez vous a paper on the Care of Dependent Children
The Professor shuffled up his subjects and dealt them out
promiscuously and that fell to me Cest drole ca nest pas

There goes the gong for dinner Ill post this as I pass the box

 Affectionately
 J




 4th June

Dear Daddy

Very busy timecommencement in ten days examinations tomorrow lots
of studying lots of packing and the outdoor world so lovely that it
hurts you to stay inside

But never mind vacations coming Julia is going abroad this
summerit makes the fourth time No doubt about it Daddy goods are
not distributed evenly Sallie as usual goes to the Adirondacks
And what do you think I am going to do You may have three guesses
Lock Willow Wrong The Adirondacks with Sallie Wrong Ill never
attempt that again I was discouraged last year Cant you guess
anything else Youre not very inventive Ill tell you Daddy if
youll promise not to make a lot of objections I warn your secretary
in advance that my mind is made up

I am going to spend the summer at the seaside with a Mrs Charles
Paterson and tutor her daughter who is to enter college in the autumn
I met her through the McBrides and she is a very charming woman I am
to give lessons in English and Latin to the younger daughter too but
I shall have a little time to myself and I shall be earning fifty
dollars a month Doesnt that impress you as a perfectly exorbitant
amount She offered it I should have blushed to ask for more than
twentyfive

I finish at Magnolia thats where she lives the first of September
and shall probably spend the remaining three weeks at Lock WillowI
should like to see the Semples again and all the friendly animals

How does my programme strike you Daddy I am getting quite
independent you see You have put me on my feet and I think I can
almost walk alone by now

Princeton commencement and our examinations exactly coincidewhich is
an awful blow Sallie and I did so want to get away in time for it
but of course that is utterly impossible

Goodbye Daddy Have a nice summer and come back in the autumn rested
and ready for another year of work Thats what you ought to be
writing to me I havent any idea what you do in the summer or how
you amuse yourself I cant visualize your surroundings Do you play
golf or hunt or ride horseback or just sit in the sun and meditate

Anyway whatever it is have a good time and dont forget Judy




 10th June

Dear Daddy

This is the hardest letter I ever wrote but I have decided what I must
do and there isnt going to be any turning back It is very sweet and
generous and dear of you to wish to send me to Europe this summerfor
the moment I was intoxicated by the idea but sober second thoughts
said no It would be rather illogical of me to refuse to take your
money for college and then use it instead just for amusement You
mustnt get me used to too many luxuries One doesnt miss what one
has never had but its awfully hard going without things after one has
commenced thinking they are hishers English language needs another
pronoun by natural right Living with Sallie and Julia is an awful
strain on my stoical philosophy They have both had things from the
time they were babies they accept happiness as a matter of course
The World they think owes them everything they want Maybe the World
doesin any case it seems to acknowledge the debt and pay up But as
for me it owes me nothing and distinctly told me so in the beginning
I have no right to borrow on credit for there will come a time when
the World will repudiate my claim

I seem to be floundering in a sea of metaphorbut I hope you grasp my
meaning Anyway I have a very strong feeling that the only honest
thing for me to do is to teach this summer and begin to support myself



 MAGNOLIA
 Four days later

Id got just that much written whenwhat do you think happened The
maid arrived with Master Jervies card He is going abroad too this
summer not with Julia and her family but entirely by himself I told
him that you had invited me to go with a lady who is chaperoning a
party of girls He knows about you Daddy That is he knows that my
father and mother are dead and that a kind gentleman is sending me to
college I simply didnt have the courage to tell him about the John
Grier Home and all the rest He thinks that you are my guardian and a
perfectly legitimate old family friend I have never told him that I
didnt know youthat would seem too queer

Anyway he insisted on my going to Europe He said that it was a
necessary part of my education and that I mustnt think of refusing
Also that he would be in Paris at the same time and that we would run
away from the chaperon occasionally and have dinner together at nice
funny foreign restaurants

Well Daddy it did appeal to me I almost weakened if he hadnt been
so dictatorial maybe I should have entirely weakened I can be
enticed step by step but I WONT be forced He said I was a silly
foolish irrational quixotic idiotic stubborn child those are a few
of his abusive adjectives the rest escape me and that I didnt know
what was good for me I ought to let older people judge We almost
quarrelledI am not sure but that we entirely did

In any case I packed my trunk fast and came up here I thought Id
better see my bridges in flames behind me before I finished writing to
you They are entirely reduced to ashes now Here I am at Cliff Top
the name of Mrs Patersons cottage with my trunk unpacked and
Florence the little one already struggling with first declension
nouns And it bids fair to be a struggle She is a most uncommonly
spoiled child I shall have to teach her first how to studyshe has
never in her life concentrated on anything more difficult than
icecream soda water

We use a quiet corner of the cliffs for a schoolroomMrs Paterson
wishes me to keep them out of doorsand I will say that I find it
difficult to concentrate with the blue sea before me and ships
asailing by And when I think I might be on one sailing off to
foreign landsbut I WONT let myself think of anything but Latin
Grammar


The prepositions a or ab absque coram cum de e or ex prae pro
sine tenus in subter sub and super govern the ablative


So you see Daddy I am already plunged into work with my eyes
persistently set against temptation Dont be cross with me please
and dont think that I do not appreciate your kindness for I
doalwaysalways The only way I can ever repay you is by turning
out a Very Useful Citizen Are women citizens I dont suppose they
are Anyway a Very Useful Person And when you look at me you can
say I gave that Very Useful Person to the world

That sounds well doesnt it Daddy But I dont wish to mislead you
The feeling often comes over me that I am not at all remarkable it is
fun to plan a career but in all probability I shant turn out a bit
different from any other ordinary person I may end by marrying an
undertaker and being an inspiration to him in his work

 Yours ever
 Judy




 19th August

Dear DaddyLongLegs

My window looks out on the loveliest landscapeoceanscape
rathernothing but water and rocks

The summer goes I spend the morning with Latin and English and
algebra and my two stupid girls I dont know how Marion is ever going
to get into college or stay in after she gets there And as for
Florence she is hopelessbut oh such a little beauty I dont
suppose it matters in the least whether they are stupid or not so long
as they are pretty One cant help thinking though how their
conversation will bore their husbands unless they are fortunate enough
to obtain stupid husbands I suppose thats quite possible the world
seems to be filled with stupid men Ive met a number this summer

In the afternoon we take a walk on the cliffs or swim if the tide is
right I can swim in salt water with the utmost ease you see my
education is already being put to use

A letter comes from Mr Jervis Pendleton in Paris rather a short
concise letter Im not quite forgiven yet for refusing to follow his
advice However if he gets back in time he will see me for a few
days at Lock Willow before college opens and if I am very nice and
sweet and docile I shall I am led to infer be received into favour
again

Also a letter from Sallie She wants me to come to their camp for two
weeks in September Must I ask your permission or havent I yet
arrived at the place where I can do as I please Yes I am sure I
haveIm a Senior you know Having worked all summer I feel like
taking a little healthful recreation I want to see the Adirondacks I
want to see Sallie I want to see Sallies brotherhes going to teach
me to canoeand we come to my chief motive which is mean I want
Master Jervie to arrive at Lock Willow and find me not there

I MUST show him that he cant dictate to me No one can dictate to me
but you Daddyand you cant always Im off for the woods

 Judy




 CAMP MCBRIDE
 6th September

Dear Daddy

Your letter didnt come in time I am pleased to say If you wish your
instructions to be obeyed you must have your secretary transmit them
in less than two weeks As you observe I am here and have been for
five days

The woods are fine and so is the camp and so is the weather and so
are the McBrides and so is the whole world Im very happy

Theres Jimmie calling for me to come canoeing Goodbyesorry to have
disobeyed but why are you so persistent about not wanting me to play a
little When Ive worked all the summer I deserve two weeks You are
awfully doginthemangerish

HoweverI love you still Daddy in spite of all your faults

 Judy




 3rd October
Dear DaddyLongLegs

Back at college and a Senioralso editor of the Monthly It doesnt
seem possible does it that so sophisticated a person just four years
ago was an inmate of the John Grier Home We do arrive fast in
America

What do you think of this A note from Master Jervie directed to Lock
Willow and forwarded here Hes sorry but he finds that he cant get
up there this autumn he has accepted an invitation to go yachting with
some friends Hopes Ive had a nice summer and am enjoying the country

And he knew all the time that I was with the McBrides for Julia told
him so You men ought to leave intrigue to women you havent a light
enough touch

Julia has a trunkful of the most ravishing new clothesan evening gown
of rainbow Liberty crepe that would be fitting raiment for the angels
in Paradise And I thought that my own clothes this year were
unprecedentedly is there such a word beautiful I copied Mrs
Patersons wardrobe with the aid of a cheap dressmaker and though the
gowns didnt turn out quite twins of the originals I was entirely
happy until Julia unpacked But nowI live to see Paris

Dear Daddy arent you glad youre not a girl I suppose you think
that the fuss we make over clothes is too absolutely silly It is No
doubt about it But its entirely your fault

Did you ever hear about the learned Herr Professor who regarded
unnecessary adornment with contempt and favoured sensible utilitarian
clothes for women His wife who was an obliging creature adopted
dress reform And what do you think he did He eloped with a chorus
girl

 Yours ever
 Judy


PS The chambermaid in our corridor wears blue checked gingham
aprons I am going to get her some brown ones instead and sink the
blue ones in the bottom of the lake I have a reminiscent chill every
time I look at them





 17th November

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Such a blight has fallen over my literary career I dont know whether
to tell you or not but I would like some sympathysilent sympathy
please dont reopen the wound by referring to it in your next letter

Ive been writing a book all last winter in the evenings and all the
summer when I wasnt teaching Latin to my two stupid children I just
finished it before college opened and sent it to a publisher He kept
it two months and I was certain he was going to take it but yesterday
morning an express parcel came thirty cents due and there it was back
again with a letter from the publisher a very nice fatherly
letterbut frank He said he saw from the address that I was still at
college and if I would accept some advice he would suggest that I put
all of my energy into my lessons and wait until I graduated before
beginning to write He enclosed his readers opinion Here it is

Plot highly improbable Characterization exaggerated Conversation
unnatural A good deal of humour but not always in the best of taste
Tell her to keep on trying and in time she may produce a real book

Not on the whole flattering is it Daddy And I thought I was making
a notable addition to American literature I did truly I was
planning to surprise you by writing a great novel before I graduated
I collected the material for it while I was at Julias last Christmas
But I dare say the editor is right Probably two weeks was not enough
in which to observe the manners and customs of a great city

I took it walking with me yesterday afternoon and when I came to the
gas house I went in and asked the engineer if I might borrow his
furnace He politely opened the door and with my own hands I chucked
it in I felt as though I had cremated my only child

I went to bed last night utterly dejected I thought I was never going
to amount to anything and that you had thrown away your money for
nothing But what do you think I woke up this morning with a
beautiful new plot in my head and Ive been going about all day
planning my characters just as happy as I could be No one can ever
accuse me of being a pessimist If I had a husband and twelve children
swallowed by an earthquake one day Id bob up smilingly the next
morning and commence to look for another set

 Affectionately
 Judy




 14th December

Dear DaddyLongLegs

I dreamed the funniest dream last night I thought I went into a book
store and the clerk brought me a new book named The Life and Letters of
Judy Abbott I could see it perfectly plainlyred cloth binding with
a picture of the John Grier Home on the cover and my portrait for a
frontispiece with Very truly yours Judy Abbott written below But
just as I was turning to the end to read the inscription on my
tombstone I woke up It was very annoying I almost found out whom
Im going to marry and when Im going to die

Dont you think it would be interesting if you really could read the
story of your lifewritten perfectly truthfully by an omniscient
author And suppose you could only read it on this condition that
you would never forget it but would have to go through life knowing
ahead of time exactly how everything you did would turn out and
foreseeing to the exact hour the time when you would die How many
people do you suppose would have the courage to read it then or how
many could suppress their curiosity sufficiently to escape from reading
it even at the price of having to live without hope and without
surprises

Life is monotonous enough at best you have to eat and sleep about so
often But imagine how DEADLY monotonous it would be if nothing
unexpected could happen between meals Mercy Daddy theres a blot
but Im on the third page and I cant begin a new sheet

Im going on with biology again this yearvery interesting subject
were studying the alimentary system at present You should see how
sweet a crosssection of the duodenum of a cat is under the microscope

Also weve arrived at philosophyinteresting but evanescent I prefer
biology where you can pin the subject under discussion to a board
Theres another And another This pen is weeping copiously Please
excuse its tears

Do you believe in free will I dounreservedly I dont agree at all
with the philosophers who think that every action is the absolutely
inevitable and automatic resultant of an aggregation of remote causes
Thats the most immoral doctrine I ever heardnobody would be to blame
for anything If a man believed in fatalism he would naturally just
sit down and say The Lords will be done and continue to sit until
he fell over dead

I believe absolutely in my own free will and my own power to
accomplishand that is the belief that moves mountains You watch me
become a great author I have four chapters of my new book finished
and five more drafted

This is a very abstruse letterdoes your head ache Daddy I think
well stop now and make some fudge Im sorry I cant send you a
piece it will be unusually good for were going to make it with real
cream and three butter balls

 Yours affectionately
 Judy


PS Were having fancy dancing in gymnasium class You can see by the
accompanying picture how much we look like a real ballet The one at

 26th December

My Dear Dear Daddy

Havent you any sense Dont you KNOW that you mustnt give one girl
seventeen Christmas presents Im a Socialist please remember do you
wish to turn me into a Plutocrat

Think how embarrassing it would be if we should ever quarrel I should
have to engage a movingvan to return your gifts

I am sorry that the necktie I sent was so wobbly I knit it with my own
hands as you doubtless discovered from internal evidence You will
have to wear it on cold days and keep your coat buttoned up tight

Thank you Daddy a thousand times I think youre the sweetest man
that ever livedand the foolishest

 Judy


Heres a fourleaf clover from Camp McBride to bring you good luck for
the New Year




 9th January

Do you wish to do something Daddy that will ensure your eternal
salvation There is a family here who are in awfully desperate
straits A mother and father and four visible childrenthe two older
boys have disappeared into the world to make their fortune and have not
sent any of it back The father worked in a glass factory and got
consumptionits awfully unhealthy workand now has been sent away to
a hospital That took all their savings and the support of the family
falls upon the oldest daughter who is twentyfour She dressmakes for
150 a day when she can get it and embroiders centrepieces in the
evening The mother isnt very strong and is extremely ineffectual and
pious She sits with her hands folded a picture of patient
resignation while the daughter kills herself with overwork and
responsibility and worry she doesnt see how they are going to get
through the rest of the winterand I dont either One hundred
dollars would buy some coal and some shoes for three children so that
they could go to school and give a little margin so that she neednt
worry herself to death when a few days pass and she doesnt get work

You are the richest man I know Dont you suppose you could spare one
hundred dollars That girl deserves help a lot more than I ever did
I wouldnt ask it except for the girl I dont care much what happens
to the mothershe is such a jellyfish

The way people are for ever rolling their eyes to heaven and saying
Perhaps its all for the best when they are perfectly dead sure its
not makes me enraged Humility or resignation or whatever you choose
to call it is simply impotent inertia Im for a more militant
religion

We are getting the most dreadful lessons in philosophyall of
Schopenhauer for tomorrow The professor doesnt seem to realize that
we are taking any other subject Hes a queer old duck he goes about
with his head in the clouds and blinks dazedly when occasionally he
strikes solid earth He tries to lighten his lectures with an
occasional witticismand we do our best to smile but I assure you his
jokes are no laughing matter He spends his entire time between
classes in trying to figure out whether matter really exists or whether
he only thinks it exists

Im sure my sewing girl hasnt any doubt but that it exists

Where do you think my new novel is In the wastebasket I can see
myself that its no good on earth and when a loving author realizes
that what WOULD be the judgment of a critical public


 Later

I address you Daddy from a bed of pain For two days Ive been laid
up with swollen tonsils I can just swallow hot milk and that is all
What were your parents thinking of not to have those tonsils out when
you were a baby the doctor wished to know Im sure I havent an
idea but I doubt if they were thinking much about me

 Yours
 J A




 Next morning

I just read this over before sealing it I dont know WHY I cast such
a misty atmosphere over life I hasten to assure you that I am young
and happy and exuberant and I trust you are the same Youth has
nothing to do with birthdays only with ALIVEDNESS of spirit so even
if your hair is grey Daddy you can still be a boy

 Affectionately
 Judy




 12th Jan

Dear Mr Philanthropist

Your cheque for my family came yesterday Thank you so much I cut
gymnasium and took it down to them right after luncheon and you should
have seen the girls face She was so surprised and happy and relieved
that she looked almost young and shes only twentyfour Isnt it
pitiful

Anyway she feels now as though all the good things were coming
together She has steady work ahead for two monthssomeones getting
married and theres a trousseau to make

Thank the good Lord cried the mother when she grasped the fact that
that small piece of paper was one hundred dollars

It wasnt the good Lord at all said I it was DaddyLongLegs
Mr Smith I called you

But it was the good Lord who put it in his mind said she

Not at all I put it in his mind myself said I

But anyway Daddy I trust the good Lord will reward you suitably You
deserve ten thousand years out of purgatory

 Yours most gratefully
 Judy Abbott




 15th Feb

May it please Your Most Excellent Majesty

This morning I did eat my breakfast upon a cold turkey pie and a goose
and I did send for a cup of tee a china drink of which I had never
drank before

Dont be nervous DaddyI havent lost my mind Im merely quoting
Saml Pepys Were reading him in connection with English History
original sources Sallie and Julia and I converse now in the language
of 1660 Listen to this

I went to Charing Cross to see Major Harrison hanged drawn and
quartered he looking as cheerful as any man could do in that
condition And this Dined with my lady who is in handsome mourning
for her brother who died yesterday of spotted fever

Seems a little early to commence entertaining doesnt it A friend of
Pepys devised a very cunning manner whereby the king might pay his
debts out of the sale to poor people of old decayed provisions What
do you a reformer think of that I dont believe were so bad today
as the newspapers make out

Samuel was as excited about his clothes as any girl he spent five
times as much on dress as his wifethat appears to have been the
Golden Age of husbands Isnt this a touching entry You see he
really was honest Today came home my fine Camlett cloak with gold
buttons which cost me much money and I pray God to make me able to
pay for it

Excuse me for being so full of Pepys Im writing a special topic on
him

What do you think Daddy The SelfGovernment Association has
abolished the ten oclock rule We can keep our lights all night if we
choose the only requirement being that we do not disturb otherswe
are not supposed to entertain on a large scale The result is a
beautiful commentary on human nature Now that we may stay up as long
as we choose we no longer choose Our heads begin to nod at nine
oclock and by ninethirty the pen drops from our nerveless grasp
Its ninethirty now Good night


 Sunday

Just back from churchpreacher from Georgia We must take care he
says not to develop our intellects at the expense of our emotional
naturesbut methought it was a poor dry sermon Pepys again It
doesnt matter what part of the United States or Canada they come from
or what denomination they are we always get the same sermon Why on
earth dont they go to mens colleges and urge the students not to
allow their manly natures to be crushed out by too much mental
application

Its a beautiful dayfrozen and icy and clear As soon as dinner is
over Sallie and Julia and Marty Keene and Eleanor Pratt friends of
mine but you dont know them and I are going to put on short skirts
and walk cross country to Crystal Spring Farm and have a fried chicken
and waffle supper and then have Mr Crystal Spring drive us home in
his buckboard We are supposed to be inside the campus at seven but
we are going to stretch a point tonight and make it eight

 March Fifth

Dear Mr Trustee

Tomorrow is the first Wednesday in the montha weary day for the John
Grier Home How relieved theyll be when five oclock comes and you
pat them on the head and take yourselves off Did you individually
ever pat me on the head Daddy I dont believe somy memory seems to
be concerned only with fat Trustees

Give the Home my love pleasemy TRULY love I have quite a feeling
of tenderness for it as I look back through a haze of four years When
I first came to college I felt quite resentful because Id been robbed
of the normal kind of childhood that the other girls had had but now
I dont feel that way in the least I regard it as a very unusual
adventure It gives me a sort of vantage point from which to stand
aside and look at life Emerging full grown I get a perspective on
the world that other people who have been brought up in the thick of
things entirely lack

I know lots of girls Julia for instance who never know that they are
happy They are so accustomed to the feeling that their senses are
deadened to it but as for meI am perfectly sure every moment of my
life that I am happy And Im going to keep on being no matter what
unpleasant things turn up Im going to regard them even toothaches
as interesting experiences and be glad to know what they feel like
Whatever skys above me Ive a heart for any fate

However Daddy dont take this new affection for the JGH too
literally If I have five children like Rousseau I shant leave them
on the steps of a foundling asylum in order to insure their being
brought up simply

Give my kindest regards to Mrs Lippett that I think is truthful
love would be a little strong and dont forget to tell her what a
beautiful nature Ive developed

 Affectionately
 Judy



 LOCK WILLOW
 4th April

Dear Daddy

Do you observe the postmark Sallie and I are embellishing Lock Willow
with our presence during the Easter Vacation We decided that the best
thing we could do with our ten days was to come where it is quiet Our
nerves had got to the point where they wouldnt stand another meal in
Fergussen Dining in a room with four hundred girls is an ordeal when
you are tired There is so much noise that you cant hear the girls
across the table speak unless they make their hands into a megaphone
and shout That is the truth

We are tramping over the hills and reading and writing and having a
nice restful time We climbed to the top of Sky Hill this morning
where Master Jervie and I once cooked supperit doesnt seem possible
that it was nearly two years ago I could still see the place where
the smoke of our fire blackened the rock It is funny how certain
places get connected with certain people and you never go back without
thinking of them I was quite lonely without himfor two minutes

What do you think is my latest activity Daddy You will begin to
believe that I am incorrigibleI am writing a book I started it
three weeks ago and am eating it up in chunks Ive caught the secret
Master Jervie and that editor man were right you are most convincing
when you write about the things you know And this time it is about
something that I do knowexhaustively Guess where its laid In the
John Grier Home And its good Daddy I actually believe it isjust
about the tiny little things that happened every day Im a realist
now Ive abandoned romanticism I shall go back to it later though
when my own adventurous future begins

This new book is going to get itself finishedand published You see
if it doesnt If you just want a thing hard enough and keep on trying
you do get it in the end Ive been trying for four years to get a
letter from youand I havent given up hope yet

Goodbye Daddy dear

I like to call you Daddy dear its so alliterative

 Affectionately
 Judy


PS I forgot to tell you the farm news but its very distressing
Skip this postscript if you dont want your sensibilities all wrought
up

Poor old Grove is dead He got so that he couldnt chew and they had
to shoot him

Nine chickens were killed by a weasel or a skunk or a rat last week

One of the cows is sick and we had to have the veterinary surgeon out
from Bonnyrigg Four Corners Amasai stayed up all night to give her
linseed oil and whisky But we have an awful suspicion that the poor
sick cow got nothing but linseed oil

Sentimental Tommy the tortoiseshell cat has disappeared we are
afraid he has been caught in a trap

There are lots of troubles in the world




 17th May

Dear DaddyLongLegs

This is going to be extremely short because my shoulder aches at the
sight of a pen Lecture notes all day immortal novel all evening
make too much writing

Commencement three weeks from next Wednesday I think you might come
and make my acquaintanceI shall hate you if you dont Julias
inviting Master Jervie he being her family and Sallies inviting
Jimmie McB he being her family but who is there for me to invite
Just you and Lippett and I dont want her Please come

Yours with love and writers cramp
 Judy




 LOCK WILLOW
 19th June

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Im educated My diploma is in the bottom bureau drawer with my two
best dresses Commencement was as usual with a few showers at vital
moments Thank you for your rosebuds They were lovely Master
Jervie and Master Jimmie both gave me roses too but I left theirs in
the bath tub and carried yours in the class procession

Here I am at Lock Willow for the summerfor ever maybe The board is
cheap the surroundings quiet and conducive to a literary life What
more does a struggling author wish I am mad about my book I think
of it every waking moment and dream of it at night All I want is
peace and quiet and lots of time to work interspersed with nourishing
meals

Master Jervie is coming up for a week or so in August and Jimmie
McBride is going to drop in sometime through the summer Hes
connected with a bond house now and goes about the country selling
bonds to banks Hes going to combine the Farmers National at the
Corners and me on the same trip

You see that Lock Willow isnt entirely lacking in society Id be
expecting to have you come motoring throughonly I know now that that
is hopeless When you wouldnt come to my commencement I tore you
from my heart and buried you for ever

 Judy Abbott AB




 24th July

Dearest DaddyLongLegs

Isnt it fun to workor dont you ever do it Its especially fun
when your kind of work is the thing youd rather do more than anything
else in the world Ive been writing as fast as my pen would go every
day this summer and my only quarrel with life is that the days arent
long enough to write all the beautiful and valuable and entertaining
thoughts Im thinking

Ive finished the second draft of my book and am going to begin the
third tomorrow morning at halfpast seven Its the sweetest book you
ever sawit is truly I think of nothing else I can barely wait in
the morning to dress and eat before beginning then I write and write
and write till suddenly Im so tired that Im limp all over Then I go
out with Colin the new sheep dog and romp through the fields and get
a fresh supply of ideas for the next day Its the most beautiful book
you ever sawOh pardonI said that before

You dont think me conceited do you Daddy dear

Im not really only just now Im in the enthusiastic stage Maybe
later on Ill get cold and critical and sniffy No Im sure I wont
This time Ive written a real book Just wait till you see it

Ill try for a minute to talk about something else I never told you
did I that Amasai and Carrie got married last May They are still
working here but so far as I can see it has spoiled them both She
used to laugh when he tramped in mud or dropped ashes on the floor but
nowyou should hear her scold And she doesnt curl her hair any
longer Amasai who used to be so obliging about beating rugs and
carrying wood grumbles if you suggest such a thing Also his neckties
are quite dingyblack and brown where they used to be scarlet and
purple Ive determined never to marry Its a deteriorating process
evidently

There isnt much of any farm news The animals are all in the best of
health The pigs are unusually fat the cows seem contented and the
hens are laying well Are you interested in poultry If so let me
recommend that invaluable little work 200 Eggs per Hen per Year I am
thinking of starting an incubator next spring and raising broilers
You see Im settled at Lock Willow permanently I have decided to stay
until Ive written 114 novels like Anthony Trollopes mother Then I
shall have completed my life work and can retire and travel

Mr James McBride spent last Sunday with us Fried chicken and
icecream for dinner both of which he appeared to appreciate I was
awfully glad to see him he brought a momentary reminder that the world
at large exists Poor Jimmie is having a hard time peddling his bonds
The Farmers National at the Corners wouldnt have anything to do
with them in spite of the fact that they pay six per cent interest
and sometimes seven I think hell end up by going home to Worcester
and taking a job in his fathers factory Hes too open and confiding
and kindhearted ever to make a successful financier But to be the
manager of a flourishing overall factory is a very desirable position
dont you think Just now he turns up his nose at overalls but hell
come to them

I hope you appreciate the fact that this is a long letter from a person
with writers cramp But I still love you Daddy dear and Im very
happy With beautiful scenery all about and lots to eat and a
comfortable fourpost bed and a ream of blank paper and a pint of
inkwhat more does one want in the world

 Yours as always
 Judy

PS The postman arrives with some more news We are to expect Master
Jervie on Friday next to spend a week Thats a very pleasant
prospectonly I am afraid my poor book will suffer Master Jervie is
very demanding




 27th August

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Where are you I wonder

I never know what part of the world you are in but I hope youre not
in New York during this awful weather I hope youre on a mountain
peak but not in Switzerland somewhere nearer looking at the snow and
thinking about me Please be thinking about me Im quite lonely and
I want to be thought about Oh Daddy I wish I knew you Then when
we were unhappy we could cheer each other up

I dont think I can stand much more of Lock Willow Im thinking of
moving Sallie is going to do settlement work in Boston next winter
Dont you think it would be nice for me to go with her then we could
have a studio together I would write while she SETTLED and we could
be together in the evenings Evenings are very long when theres no
one but the Semples and Carrie and Amasai to talk to I know in
advance that you wont like my studio idea I can read your
secretarys letter now


Miss Jerusha Abbott
 DEAR MADAM

Mr Smith prefers that you remain at Lock Willow
 Yours truly
 ELMER H GRIGGS


I hate your secretary I am certain that a man named Elmer H Griggs
must be horrid But truly Daddy I think I shall have to go to
Boston I cant stay here If something doesnt happen soon I shall
throw myself into the silo pit out of sheer desperation

Mercy but its hot All the grass is burnt up and the brooks are dry
and the roads are dusty It hasnt rained for weeks and weeks

This letter sounds as though I had hydrophobia but I havent I just
want some family

Goodbye my dearest Daddy

 I wish I knew you
 Judy




 LOCK WILLOW
 19th September

Dear Daddy

Something has happened and I need advice I need it from you and from
nobody else in the world Wouldnt it be possible for me to see you
Its so much easier to talk than to write and Im afraid your
secretary might open the letter
 Judy

PS Im very unhappy




 LOCK WILLOW
 3rd October

Dear DaddyLongLegs

Your note written in your own handand a pretty wobbly handcame
this morning I am so sorry that you have been ill I wouldnt have
bothered you with my affairs if I had known Yes I will tell you the
trouble but its sort of complicated to write and VERY PRIVATE
Please dont keep this letter but burn it

Before I beginheres a cheque for one thousand dollars It seems
funny doesnt it for me to be sending a cheque to you Where do you
think I got it

Ive sold my story Daddy Its going to be published serially in
seven parts and then in a book You might think Id be wild with joy
but Im not Im entirely apathetic Of course Im glad to begin
paying youI owe you over two thousand more Its coming in
instalments Now dont be horrid please about taking it because it
makes me happy to return it I owe you a great deal more than the mere
money and the rest I will continue to pay all my life in gratitude and
affection

And now Daddy about the other thing please give me your most worldly
advice whether you think Ill like it or not

You know that Ive always had a very special feeling towards you you
sort of represented my whole family but you wont mind will you if I
tell you that I have a very much more special feeling for another man
You can probably guess without much trouble who he is I suspect that
my letters have been very full of Master Jervie for a very long time

I wish I could make you understand what he is like and how entirely
companionable we are We think the same about everythingI am afraid
I have a tendency to make over my ideas to match his But he is almost
always right he ought to be you know for he has fourteen years
start of me In other ways though hes just an overgrown boy and he
does need looking afterhe hasnt any sense about wearing rubbers when
it rains He and I always think the same things are funny and that is
such a lot its dreadful when two peoples senses of humour are
antagonistic I dont believe theres any bridging that gulf

And he isOh well He is just himself and I miss him and miss him
and miss him The whole world seems empty and aching I hate the
moonlight because its beautiful and he isnt here to see it with me
But maybe youve loved somebody too and you know If you have I
dont need to explain if you havent I cant explain

Anyway thats the way I feeland Ive refused to marry him

I didnt tell him why I was just dumb and miserable I couldnt think
of anything to say And now he has gone away imagining that I want to
marry Jimmie McBrideI dont in the least I wouldnt think of
marrying Jimmie he isnt grown up enough But Master Jervie and I got
into a dreadful muddle of misunderstanding and we both hurt each
others feelings The reason I sent him away was not because I didnt
care for him but because I cared for him so much I was afraid he
would regret it in the futureand I couldnt stand that It didnt
seem right for a person of my lack of antecedents to marry into any
such family as his I never told him about the orphan asylum and I
hated to explain that I didnt know who I was I may be DREADFUL you
know And his family are proudand Im proud too

Also I felt sort of bound to you After having been educated to be a
writer I must at least try to be one it would scarcely be fair to
accept your education and then go off and not use it But now that I
am going to be able to pay back the money I feel that I have partially
discharged that debtbesides I suppose I could keep on being a writer
even if I did marry The two professions are not necessarily exclusive

Ive been thinking very hard about it Of course he is a Socialist
and he has unconventional ideas maybe he wouldnt mind marrying into
the proletariat so much as some men might Perhaps when two people are
exactly in accord and always happy when together and lonely when
apart they ought not to let anything in the world stand between them
Of course I WANT to believe that But Id like to get your unemotional
opinion You probably belong to a Family also and will look at it
from a worldly point of view and not just a sympathetic human point of
viewso you see how brave I am to lay it before you

Suppose I go to him and explain that the trouble isnt Jimmie but is
the John Grier Homewould that be a dreadful thing for me to do It
would take a great deal of courage Id almost rather be miserable for
the rest of my life

This happened nearly two months ago I havent heard a word from him
since he was here I was just getting sort of acclimated to the
feeling of a broken heart when a letter came from Julia that stirred
me all up again She saidvery casuallythat Uncle Jervis had been
caught out all night in a storm when he was hunting in Canada and had
been ill ever since with pneumonia And I never knew it I was
feeling hurt because he had just disappeared into blankness without a
word I think hes pretty unhappy and I know I am

What seems to you the right thing for me to do

 Judy




 6th October

Dearest DaddyLongLegs

Yes certainly Ill comeat halfpast four next Wednesday afternoon
Of COURSE I can find the way Ive been in New York three times and am
not quite a baby I cant believe that I am really going to see
youIve been just THINKING you so long that it hardly seems as though
you are a tangible fleshandblood person

You are awfully good Daddy to bother yourself with me when youre
not strong Take care and dont catch cold These fall rains are very
damp

 Affectionately
 Judy


PS Ive just had an awful thought Have you a butler Im afraid of
butlers and if one opens the door I shall faint upon the step What
can I say to him You didnt tell me your name Shall I ask for Mr
Smith




 Thursday Morning

My Very Dearest MasterJervieDaddyLongLegs PendletonSmith

Did you sleep last night I didnt Not a single wink I was too
amazed and excited and bewildered and happy I dont believe I ever
shall sleep againor eat either But I hope you slept you must you
know because then you will get well faster and can come to me

Dear Man I cant bear to think how ill youve beenand all the time I
never knew it When the doctor came down yesterday to put me in the
cab he told me that for three days they gave you up Oh dearest if
that had happened the light would have gone out of the world for me
I suppose that some day in the far futureone of us must leave the
other but at least we shall have had our happiness and there will be
memories to live with

I meant to cheer you upand instead I have to cheer myself For in
spite of being happier than I ever dreamed I could be Im also
soberer The fear that something may happen rests like a shadow on my
heart Always before I could be frivolous and carefree and
unconcerned because I had nothing precious to lose But nowI shall
have a Great Big Worry all the rest of my life Whenever you are away
from me I shall be thinking of all the automobiles that can run over
you or the signboards that can fall on your head or the dreadful
squirmy germs that you may be swallowing My peace of mind is gone for
everbut anyway I never cared much for just plain peace

Please get wellfastfastfast I want to have you close by where I
can touch you and make sure you are tangible Such a little half hour
we had together Im afraid maybe I dreamed it If I were only a
member of your family a very distant fourth cousin then I could come
and visit you every day and read aloud and plump up your pillow and
smooth out those two little wrinkles in your forehead and make the
corners of your mouth turn up in a nice cheerful smile But you are
cheerful again arent you You were yesterday before I left The
doctor said I must be a good nurse that you looked ten years younger
I hope that being in love doesnt make every one ten years younger
Will you still care for me darling if I turn out to be only eleven

Yesterday was the most wonderful day that could ever happen If I live
to be ninetynine I shall never forget the tiniest detail The girl
that left Lock Willow at dawn was a very different person from the one
who came back at night Mrs Semple called me at halfpast four I
started wide awake in the darkness and the first thought that popped
into my head was I am going to see DaddyLongLegs I ate breakfast
in the kitchen by candlelight and then drove the five miles to the
station through the most glorious October colouring The sun came up
on the way and the swamp maples and dogwood glowed crimson and orange
and the stone walls and cornfields sparkled with hoar frost the air
was keen and clear and full of promise I knew something was going to
happen All the way in the train the rails kept singing Youre going
to see DaddyLongLegs It made me feel secure I had such faith in
Daddys ability to set things right And I knew that somewhere another
mandearer than Daddywas wanting to see me and somehow I had a
feeling that before the journey ended I should meet him too And you
see

When I came to the house on Madison Avenue it looked so big and brown
and forbidding that I didnt dare go in so I walked around the block
to get up my courage But I neednt have been a bit afraid your
butler is such a nice fatherly old man that he made me feel at home at
once Is this Miss Abbott he said to me and I said Yes so I
didnt have to ask for Mr Smith after all He told me to wait in the
drawingroom It was a very sombre magnificent mans sort of room I
sat down on the edge of a big upholstered chair and kept saying to
myself

Im going to see DaddyLongLegs Im going to see DaddyLongLegs


Then presently the man came back and asked me please to step up to the
library I was so excited that really and truly my feet would hardly
take me up Outside the door he turned and whispered Hes been very
ill Miss This is the first day hes been allowed to sit up Youll
not stay long enough to excite him I knew from the way he said it
that he loved youand I think hes an old dear

Then he knocked and said Miss Abbott and I went in and the door
closed behind me

It was so dim coming in from the brightly lighted hall that for a
moment I could scarcely make out anything then I saw a big easy chair
before the fire and a shining tea table with a smaller chair beside it
And I realized that a man was sitting in the big chair propped up by
pillows with a rug over his knees Before I could stop him he
roserather shakilyand steadied himself by the back of the chair and
just looked at me without a word And thenand thenI saw it was
you But even with that I didnt understand I thought Daddy had had
you come there to meet me or a surprise

Then you laughed and held out your hand and said Dear little Judy
couldnt you guess that I was DaddyLongLegs

In an instant it flashed over me Oh but I have been stupid A
hundred little things might have told me if I had had any wits I
wouldnt make a very good detective would I Daddy Jervie What
must I call you Just plain Jervie sounds disrespectful and I cant
be disrespectful to you

It was a very sweet half hour before your doctor came and sent me away
I was so dazed when I got to the station that I almost took a train for
St Louis And you were pretty dazed too You forgot to give me any
tea But were both very very happy arent we I drove back to Lock
Willow in the dark but oh how the stars were shining And this
morning Ive been out with Colin visiting all the places that you and I
went to together and remembering what you said and how you looked
The woods today are burnished bronze and the air is full of frost
Its CLIMBING weather I wish you were here to climb the hills with
me I am missing you dreadfully Jervie dear but its a happy kind of
missing well be together soon We belong to each other now really
and truly no makebelieve Doesnt it seem queer for me to belong to
someone at last It seems very very sweet

And I shall never let you be sorry for a single instant

 Yours for ever and ever
 Judy


PS This is the first loveletter I ever wrote Isnt it funny that I
know how

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
