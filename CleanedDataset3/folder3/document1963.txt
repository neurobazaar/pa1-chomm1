THE CONFESSION

By Mary Roberts Rinehart





I


I am not a susceptible woman I am objective rather than subjective
and a fairly full experience of life has taught me that most of my
impressions are from within out rather than the other way about For
instance obsession at one time a few years ago of a shadowy figure
on my right just beyond the field of vision was later exposed as
the result of a defect in my glasses In the same way Maggie my old
servant was during one entire summer haunted by churchbells and
considered it a personal summons to eternity until it was shown to be in
her inner ear

Yet the Benton house undeniably made me uncomfortable Perhaps it was
because it had remained unchanged for so long The old horsehair chairs
with their shiny mahogany frames showed by the slightly worn places
in the carpet before them that they had not deviated an inch from their
position for many years The carpetscarpets that reached to the very
baseboards and gave under ones feet with the yielding of heavy padding
beneathwere bright under beds and wardrobes while in the centers of
the rooms they had faded into the softness of old tapestry

Maggie I remember on our arrival moved a chair from the wall in the
library and immediately put it back again with a glance to see if I
had observed her

Its nice and clean Miss Agnes she said AI kind of feel that a
little dirt would make it more homelike

Im sure I dont see why I replied rather sharply Ive lived in a
tolerably clean house most of my life

Maggie however was digging a heel into the padded carpet She had
chosen a sunny place for the experiment and a small cloud of dust rose
like smoke

Germs she said Just what I expected Wed better bring the vacuum
cleaner out from the city Miss Agnes Them carpets havent been lifted
for years

But I paid little attention to her To Maggie any particle of matter not
otherwise classified is a germ and the prospect of finding dust in that
immaculate house was sufficiently thrilling to tide over the strangeness
of our first few hours in it

Once a year I rent a house in the country When my nephew and niece were
children I did it to take them out of the city during school vacations
Later when they grew up it was to be near the country club But now
with the children married and new families coming along we were more
concerned with dairies than with clubs and I inquired more carefully
about the neighborhood cows than about the neighborhood golflinks I
had really selected the house at Benton Station because there was a most
alluring pasture with a brook running through it and violets over the
banks It seemed to me that no cow with a conscience could live in those
surroundings and give colicky milk

Then the house was cheap Unbelievably cheap I suspected sewerage
at once but it seemed to be in the best possible order Indeed new
plumbing had been put in and extra bathrooms installed As old Miss
Emily Benton lived there alone with only an old couple to look after
her it looked odd to see three bathrooms two of them new on the
second floor Big tubs and showers although little old Miss Emily could
have bathed in the washbowl and have had room to spare

I faced the agent downstairs in the parlor after I had gone over the
house Miss Emily Benton had not appeared and I took it she was away

Why all those bathrooms I demanded Does she use them in rotation

He shrugged his shoulders

She wished to rent the house Miss Blakiston The oldfashioned
plumbing

But she is giving the house away I exclaimed Those bathrooms have
cost much more than she will get out of it You and I know that the
price is absurd

He smiled at that If you wish to pay more you may of course She is
a fine woman Miss Blakiston but you can never measure a Benton with
any yardstick but their own The truth is that she wants the house off
her hands this summer I dont know why Its a good house and she has
lived here all her life But my instructions Ill tell you frankly are
to rent it if I have to give it away

With which absurd sentence we went out the front door and I saw the
pasture which decided me

In view of the fact that I had taken the house for my grandnieces and
nephews it was annoying to find by the end of June that I should have
to live in it by myself Willies boy was having his teeth straightened
and must make daily visits to the dentist and Jack went to California
and took Gertrude and the boys with him

The first curious thing happened then I wrote to the agent saying that
I would not use the house but enclosing a check for its rental as I
had signed the lease To my surprise I received in reply a note from
Miss Emily herself very carefully written on thin notepaper

Although it was years since I had seen her the exquisite neatness of
the letter its careful paragraphing its margins so accurate as to give
the impression that she had drawn a faint margin line with a lead
pencil and then erased itall these were as indicative of Emily Benton
aswell as the letter was not

As well as I can explain it the letter was impulsive almost urgent
Yet the little old lady I remembered was neither of these things My
dear Miss Blakiston she wrote But I do hope you will use the house
It was because I wanted to be certain that it would be occupied this
summer that I asked so low a rent for it

You may call it a whim if you like but there are reasons why I wish
the house to have a summer tenant It has for one thing never been
empty since it was built It was my fathers pride and his fathers
before him that the doors were never locked even at night Of course
I can not ask a tenant to continue this old custom but I can ask you to
reconsider your decision

Will you forgive me for saying that you are so exactly the person I
should like to see in the house that I feel I can not give you up So
strongly do I feel this that I would if I dared enclose your check and
beg you to use the house rent free Faithfully yours Emily Benton

Gracefully worded and carefully written as the letter was I seemed to
feel behind it some stress of feeling an excitement perhaps totally
out of proportion to its contents Years before I had met Miss Emily
even then a frail little old lady her small figure stiffly erect her
eyes cold her whole bearing one of reserve The Bentons for all their
open doors were known in that part of the country as proud I can
remember too how when I was a young girl my mother had regarded the
rare invitations to have tea and tiny cakes in the Benton parlor as
commands no less and had taken the long carriageride from the city
with complacency And now Miss Emily last of the family had begged me
to take the house

In the end as has been shown I agreed The glamor of the past had
perhaps something to do with it But I have come to a time of life when
failing intimate interests of my own my neighbors interests are mine
by adoption To be frank I came because I was curious Why aside from
a money consideration was the Benton house to be occupied by an alien
household It was opposed to every tradition of the family as I had
heard of it

I knew something of the family history the Reverend Thaddeus Benton
rector of Saint Bartholomew who had forsaken the frame rectory near the
church to build himself the substantial home now being offered me Miss
Emily his daughter who must now I computed be nearly seventy and a
son whom I recalled faintly as hardly bearing out the Benton traditions
of solidity and rectitude

The Reverend Mr Benton I recalled had taken the stand that his house
was his own and having moved his family into it had thereafter save
on great occasions received the congregation individually or en masse
in his study at the church A patriarchal old man benevolent yet
austere who once according to a story I had heard in my girlhood had
horsewhipped one of his vestrymen for trifling with the affections of a
young married woman in the village

There was a gap of thirty years in my knowledge of the family I had
indeed forgotten its very existence when by the chance of a newspaper
advertisement I found myself involved vitally in its affairs playing
providence indeed and both fearing and hating my role Looking back
there are a number of things that appear rather curious Why for
instance did Maggie my old servant develop such a dislike for the
place It had nothing to do with the house She had not seen it when she
first refused to go But her reluctance was evident from the beginning

Ive just got a feeling about it Miss Agnes she said I cant
explain it any more than I can explain a cold in the head But its
there

At first I was inclined to blame Maggies feeling on her knowledge
that the house was cheap She knew it as she has I am sure read all
my letters for years She has a distrust of a bargain But later I came
to believe that there was something more to Maggies distrustas though
perhaps a wave of uneasiness spreading from some unknown source had
engulfed her

Indeed looking back over the two months I spent in the Benton house I
am inclined to go even further If thoughts carry as I am sure they do
then emotions carry Fear hope courage despairif the intention of
writing a letter to an absent friend can spread itself halfway across
the earth so that as you write the friend writes also and your letters
cross how much more should big emotions carry I have had sweep over
me such waves of gladness such gusts of despair as have shaken me
Yet with no cause for either They are gone in a moment Just for an
instant I have caught and made my own anothers joy or grief

The only inexplicable part of this narrative is that Maggie neither a
psychic nor a sensitive type caught the terror as I came to call it
before I did Perhaps it may be explainable by the fact that her mental
processes are comparatively simple her mind an empty slate that shows
every mark made on it

In a way this is a study in fear

Maggies resentment continued through my decision to use the house
through the packing through the very moving itself It took the form
of a sort of watchful waiting although at the time we neither of
us realized it and of dislike of the house and its surroundings It
extended itself to the very garden where she gathered flowers for the
table with a ruthlessness that was almost vicious And as July went
on and Miss Emily made her occasional visits as tiny as delicate as
herself I had a curious conclusion forced on me Miss Emily returned
her antagonism I was slow to credit it What secret and even
unacknowledged opposition could there be between my downright Maggie and
this little old aristocrat with her frail hands and the soft rustle of
silk about her

In Miss Emily it took the form ofhow strange a word to use in
connection with herof furtive watchfulness I felt that Maggies
entrance with nothing more momentous than the teatray set her upright
in her chair put an edge to her soft voice and absorbed her She was
still attentive to what I said She agreed or dissented But back of it
all with her eyes on me she was watching Maggie

With Maggie the antagonism took no such subtle form It showed itself in
the second best instead of the best china and a tendency to weak tea
when Miss Emily took hers very strong And such was the effect of their
mutual watchfulness and suspicion such perhaps was the influence of the
staid old house on me after a time even that fact of the strong tea
began to strike me as incongruous Miss Emily was so consistent so
consistently frail and dainty and sowell unspotted seems to be the
wordand so gentle yet as time went on I began to feel that she hated
Maggie with a real hatred And there was the strong tea

Indeed it was not quite normal nor was I For by that timethe middle
of July it was before I figured out as much as I have set down in
five minutesby that time I was not certain about the house It was
difficult to say just what I felt about the house Willie who came down
over a Sunday early in the summer possibly voiced it when he came down
to his breakfast there

How did you sleep I asked

Not very well He picked up his coffeecup and smiled over it rather
sheepishly To tell the truth I got to thinking about thingsthe
furniture and all that he said vaguely How many people have sat in
the chairs and seen themselves in the mirror and died in the bed and so
on

Maggie who was bringing in the toast gave a sort of low moan which
she turned into a cough

There have been twentythree deaths in it in the last forty years Mr
Willie she volunteered Thats according to the gardener And more
than half died in that room of yours

Put down that toast before you drop it Maggie I said Youre
shaking all over And go out and shut the door

Very well she said with a meekness behind which she was both
indignant and frightened But there is one word I might mention before
I go and that iscats

Cats said Willie as she slammed the door

I think it is only one cat I observed mildly It belongs to
Miss Emily I fancy It manages to be in a lot of places nearly
simultaneously and Maggie swears it is a dozen

Willie is not subtle He is a practical young man with a growing family
and a tendency the last year or two to flesh But he ate his breakfast
thoughtfully

Dont you think its rather isolated he asked finally Just you
three women here I had taken Delia the cook along

We have a telephone I said rather loftily Although I checked
myself Maggie I felt sure was listening in the pantry and I intended
to give her wild fancies no encouragement To utter a thing is to
Maggie to give it life By the mere use of the spoken word it ceases to
be supposition and becomes fact

As a matter of fact my uneasiness about the house resolved itself into
an uneasiness about the telephone It seems less absurd now than it did
then But I remember what Willie said about it that morning on our way
to the church

It rings at night Willie I said And when I go there is no one
there

So do all telephones he replied briskly Its their greatest
weakness

Once or twice we have found the thing on the floor in the morning It
couldnt blow over or knock itself down

Probably the cat he said with the patient air of a man arguing
with an unreasonable woman Of course he addedwe were passing
the churchyard then dominated by what the village called the Benton
mosolemtheres a chance that those deadandgone Bentons resent
anything as modern as a telephone It might be interesting to see what
they would do to a victrola

Im going to tell you something Willie I said I am afraid of the
telephone

He was completely incredulous I felt rather ridiculous standing there
in the sunlight of that summer Sabbath and making my confession But I
did it

I am afraid of it I repeated Im desperately sure you will never
understand Because I dont I can hardly force myself to go to it I
hate the very back corner of the hall where it stands I

I saw his expression then and I stopped furious with myself Why had
I said it But more important still why did I feel it I had not put it
into words before I had not expected to say it then But the moment I
said it I knew it was true I had developed an idee fixe

I have to go downstairs at night and answer it I added rather
feebly Its on my nerves I think

I should think it is he said with a note of wonder in his voice
It doesnt sound like you A telephone But just at the church door he
stopped me a hand on my arm

Look here he said dont you suppose its because youre so
dependent on the telephone You know that if anything goes wrong with
it youre cut off in a way And theres another pointyou get all
your news over it good and bad He had difficulty I think in finding
the words he wanted Itsits vital he said So you attach too
much importance to it and it gets to be an obsession

Very likely I assented The whole thing is idiotic anyhow

Butwas it idiotic

I am endeavoring to set things down as they seemed to me at the time
not in the light of subsequent events For if this narrative has any
interest at all it is a psychological one I have said that it is a
study in fear but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it is
a study of the mental reaction of crime of its effects on different
minds more or less remotely connected with it

That my analysis of my impressions in the church that morning are not
colored by subsequent events is proved by the fact that under cover of
that date July 16th I made the following entry

Why do Maggie and Miss Benton distrust each other

I realized it even then although I did not consider it serious as is
evidenced by the fact that I follow it with a recipe for fruit gelatin
copied from the newspaper

It was a calm and sunny Sunday morning The church windows were wide
open and a butterfly came in and set the choir boys to giggling At the
end of my pew a stainedglass window to Carlo Bentonthe name came like
an echo from the forgotten pastsent a shower of colored light over
Willie turned my blue silk to most unspinsterly hues and threw a sort
of summer radiance over Miss Emily herself in the seat ahead

She sat quite alone impeccably neat even to her profile She was so
orderly so well balanced one stitch of her handsewed organdy collar
was so clearly identical with every other her very seams if you can
understand it ran so exactly where they should that she set me to
pulling myself straight I am rather casual as to seams

After a time I began to have a curious feeling about her Her head was
toward the rector standing in a sort of white nimbus of sunlight but
I felt that Miss Emilys entire attention was on our pew immediately
behind her I find I can not put it into words unless it was that her
back settled into more rigid lines I glanced along the pew Willies
face wore a calm and slightly somnolent expression But Maggie in her
far endshe is very high church and always attendsMaggies eyes were
glued almost fiercely to Miss Emilys back And just then Miss Emily
herself stirred glanced up at the window and turning slightly
returned Maggies glance with one almost as malevolent I have hesitated
over that word It seems strong now but at the time it was the one that
came into my mind

When it was over it was hard to believe that it had happened And even
now with everything else clear I do not pretend to explain Maggies
attitude She knew in some strange way But she did not know that she
knewwhich sounds like nonsense and is as near as I can come to getting
it down in words

Willie left that night the 16th and we settled down to quiet days
and for a time to undisturbed nights But on the following Wednesday
by my journal the telephone commenced to bother me again Generally
speaking it rang rather early between eleven oclock and midnight But
on the following Saturday night I find I have recorded the hour as 2 am

In every instance the experience was identical The telephone never rang
the second time When I went downstairs to answer itI did not always
gothere was the buzzing of the wire and there was nothing else It
was on the twentyfourth that I had the telephone inspected and reported
in normal condition and it is possibly significant that for three days
afterward my record shows not a single disturbance

But I do not regard the strange calls over the telephone as so important
as my attitude to them The plain truth is that my fear of the calls
extended itself in a few days to cover the instrument and more than
that to the part of the house it stood in Maggie never had this nor
did she recognize it in me Her fear was a perfectly simple although
uncomfortable one centering around the bedrooms where in each bed
she nightly saw dead and gone Bentons laid out in all the decorum of the
best linen

On more than one evening she came to the library door with an
expression of mentally looking over her shoulder and some such dialogue
would follow

Dyou mind if I turn the bed down now Miss Agnes

Its very early

Salmost eight When she is nervous she cuts verbal corners

You know perfectly well that I dislike having the beds disturbed until
nine oclock Maggie

Im going out

You said that last night but you didnt go

Silence

Now see here Maggie I want you to overcome this feeling of I
hesitatedof fear When you have really seen or heard something it
will be time enough to be nervous

Humph said Maggie on one of these occasions and edged into the room
It was growing dusk It will be too late then Miss Agnes And another
thing Youre a brave woman I dont know as Ive seen a braver But I
notice you keep away from the telephone after dark

The general outcome of these conversations was that to avoid argument
I permitted the preparation of my room for the night at an earlier and
yet earlier hour until at last it was done the moment I was dressed for
dinner

It is clear to me now that two entirely different sorts of fear actuated
us For by that time I had to acknowledge that there was fear in the
house Even Delia the cook had absorbed some of Maggies terror
possibly traceable to some early impressions of death which connected
themselves with a fourpost bedstead

Of the two sorts of fear Delias and Maggies symptoms were subjective
Mine I still feel were objective

It was not long before the beginning of August and during a lull in
the telephone matter that I began to suspect that the house was being
visited at night

There was nothing I could point to with any certainty as having been
disturbed at first It was a matter of a book misplaced on the table of
my sewingbasket open when I always leave it closed of a burnt match on
the floor whereas it is one of my orderly habits never to leave burnt
matches around And at last the burnt match became a sort of clue for I
suspected that it had been used to light one of the candles that sat in
holders of every sort on the top of the library shelves

I tried getting up at night and peering over the banisters but without
result And I was never sure as to articles that they had been moved
I remained in that doubting and suspicious halfway ground that is worse
than certainty And there was the matter of motive I could not get away
from that What possible purpose could an intruder have for instance
in opening my sewingbasket or moving the dictionary two inches on the
center table

Yet the feeling persisted and on the second of August I find this entry
in my journal

Righthand brass eight inches lefthand brass seven inches
carvedwoodItalianfive and three quarter inches each old glass on
mantelpieceseven inches And below this dated the third Last night
between midnight and daylight the candle in the glass holder on the
right side of the mantel was burned down one and onehalf inches

I should no doubt have set a watch on my nightly visitor after making
this discoveryand one that was apparently connected with itnothing
less than Delias report that there were candledroppings over the
border of the library carpet But I have admitted that this is a study
in fear and a part of it is my own

I was afraid I was afraid of the night visitor but more than that
I was afraid of the fear It had become a real thing by that time
something that lurked in the lower back hall waiting to catch me by the
throat to stop my breath to paralyze me so I could not escape I never
went beyond that point

Yet I am not a cowardly woman I have lived alone too long for that I
have closed too many houses at night and gone upstairs in the dark to be
afraid of darkness And even now I can not looking back admit that
I was afraid of the darkness there although I resorted to the weak
expedient of leaving a short length of candle to burn itself out in the
hall when I went up to bed

I have seen one of Willies boys waken up at night screaming with a
terror he could not describe Well it was much like that with me
except that I was awake and horribly ashamed of myself

On the fourth of August I find in my journal the single word flour
It recalls both my own cowardice at that time and an experiment I made
The telephone had not bothered us for several nights and I began to
suspect a connection of this sort when the telephone rang there was no
night visitor and vice versa I was not certain

Delia was setting bread that night in the kitchen and Maggie was
reading a ghost story from the evening paper There was a fine sifting
of flour over the table and it gave me my idea When I went up to bed
that night I left a powdering of flour here and there on the lower
floor at the door into the library a patch by the table andgoing
back rather uneasilyone near the telephone

I was up and downstairs before Maggie the next morning The patches
showed trampling In the doorway they were almost obliterated as by
the trailing of a garment over them but by the fireplace there were two
prints quite distinct I knew when I saw them that I had expected the
marks of Miss Emilys tiny foot although I had not admitted it before
But these were not Miss Emilys They were large flat substantial and
one showed a curious marking around the edge thatIt was my own The
marking was the knitted side of my bedroom slipper I had so far as
I could tell gone downstairs in the night investigated the candles
possibly in darkness and gone back to bed again

The effect of the discovery on me waswell undermining In all the
uneasiness of the past few weeks I had at least had full confidence in
myself And now that was gone I began to wonder how much of the things
that had troubled me were real and how many I had made for myself

To tell the truth by that time the tension was almost unbearable My
nerves were going and there was no reason for it I kept telling myself
that In the mirror I looked white and anxious and I had a sense
of approaching trouble I caught Maggie watching me too and on the
seventh I find in my journal the words Insanity is often only a
formless terror

On the Sunday morning following that I found three burnt matches in
the library fireplace and one of the candles in the brass holders was
almost gone I sat most of the day in that room wondering what would
happen to me if I lost my mind I knew that Maggie was watching me and
I made one of those absurd hypotheses to myself that we all do at times
If any of the family came I would know that she had sent for them and
that I was really deranged It had been a long day with a steady summer
rain that had not cooled the earth but only set it steaming The air
was like hot vapor and my hair clung to my moist forehead At about
four oclock Maggie started chasing a fly with a folded newspaper She
followed it about the lower floor from room to room making little harsh
noises in her throat when she missed it The sound of the soft thud of
the paper on walls and furniture seemed suddenly more than I could bear

For heavens sake I cried Stop that noise Maggie I felt as
though my eyes were starting from my head

Its a fly she said doggedly and aimed another blow at it If I
dont kill it well have a million There its on the mantel now I
never

I felt that if she raised the paper club once more I should scream So I
got up quickly and caught her wrist She was so astonished that she let
the paper drop and there we stood staring at each other I can still
see the way her mouth hung open

Dont I said And my voice sounded thick even to my own ears
MaggieI cant stand it

My God Miss Agnes

Her tone brought me up sharply I released her arm

IIm just nervous Maggie I said and sat down I was trembling
violently

I was sane I knew it then as I know it now But I was not rational
Perhaps to most of us come now and then times when they realize that
some act or some thought is not balanced as though for a moment or
an hour the control was gone from the brain Orand I think this was
the feeling I hadthat some other control was in charge Not the Agnes
Blakiston I knew but another Agnes Blakiston perhaps was exerting a
temporary dominance a hectic craven and hateful control

That is the only outburst I recall Possibly Maggie may have others
stored away She has a tenacious memory Certainly it was my nearest
approach to violence But it had the effect of making me set a watch on
myself

Possibly it was coincidence Probably however Maggie had communicated
with Willie But two days later young Martin Sprague Freda Spragues
son stopped his car in the drive and came in He is a nerve specialist
and very good although I can remember when he came down in his night
drawers to one of his mothers dinnerparties

Thought I would just run in and see you he said Mother told me you
were here By George Miss Agnes you look younger than ever

Who told you to come Martie I asked

Told me I dont have to be told to visit an old friend

Well he asked himself to lunch and looked over the house and decided
to ask Miss Emily if she would sell an old Japanese cabinet inlaid with
mother of pearl that I would not have had as a gift And in the end
I told him my trouble of the fear that seemed to center around the
telephone and the sleepwalking

He listened carefully

Ever get any bad news over the telephone he asked

One way and another I said I had had plenty of it He went over me
thoroughly and was inclined to find my experience with the flour rather
amusing than otherwise Its rather good that he said Setting a
trap to catch yourself Youd better have Maggie sleep in your room for
a while Well its all pretty plain Miss Agnes We bury some things as
deep as possible especially if we dont want to remember that they ever
happened But the minds a queer thing It holds on pretty hard and
burying is not destroying Then we get tired or nervousmaybe
just holding the thing down and pretending it is not there makes us
nervousand up it pops like the ghost of a buried body and raises
hell You dont mind that do you he added anxiously Its exactly
what those things do raise

But I demanded irritably who rings the telephone at night I
daresay you dont contend that I go out at night and call the house and
then come back and answer the call do you

He looked at me with a maddening smile

Are you sure it really rings he asked

And so bad was my nervous condition by that time so undermined was my
selfconfidence that I was not certain And this in face of the fact
that it invariably roused Maggie as well as myself

On the eleventh of August Miss Emily came to tea The date does not
matter but by following the chronology of my journal I find I can keep
my narrative in proper sequence

I had felt better that day So far as I could determine I had
not walked in my sleep again and there was about Maggie an air of
cheerfulness and relief which showed that my condition was more nearly
normal than it had been for some time The fear of the telephone and
of the back hall was leaving me too Perhaps Martin Spragues
matteroffact explanation had helped me But my own theory had always
been the one I recorded at the beginning of this narrativethat I
caught andwell registered is a good wordthat I registered an
overwhelming fear from some unknown source

I spied Miss Emily as she got out of the hack that day a cool little
figure clad in a thin black silk dress with the sheerest possible white
collars and cuffs Her small bonnet with its crepe veil was faced with
white and her carefully crimped gray hair showed a wavy border beneath
it Mr Staley the station hackman helped her out of the surrey and
handed her the knittingbag without which she was seldom seen It was
two weeks since she had been there and she came slowly up the walk
looking from side to side at the perennial borders then in full August
bloom

She smiled when she saw me in the doorway and said with the little
anxious pucker between her eyes that was so childish Dont you think
peonies are better cut down at this time of year She took a folded
handkerchief from her bag and dabbed at her face where there was no
sign of dust to mar its old freshness It gives the lilies a better
chance my dear

I led her into the house and she produced a gay bit of knitting a baby
afghan by the signs She smiled at me over it

I am always one baby behind she explained and fell to work rapidly
She had lovely hands and I suspected them of being her one vanity

Maggie was serving tea with her usual grudging reluctance and I noticed
then that when she was in the room Miss Emily said little or nothing
I thought it probable that she did not approve of conversing before
servants and would have let it go at that had I not as I held out
Miss Emilys cup caught her looking at Maggie I had a swift impression
of antagonism again of alertness and something more When Maggie went
out Miss Emily turned to me

She is very capable I fancy

Very Entirely too capable

She looks sharp said Miss Emily It was a long time since I had heard
the word so used but it was very apt Maggie was indeed sharp But Miss
Emily launched into a general dissertation on servants and Maggies
sharpness was forgotten

It was I think when she was about to go that I asked her about the
telephone

Telephone she inquired Why no It has always done very well Of
course after a heavy snow in the winter sometimes

She had a fashion of leaving her sentences unfinished They trailed off
without any abrupt break

It rings at night

Rings

I am called frequently and when I get to the phone there is no one
there

Some of my irritation doubtless got into my voice for Miss Emily
suddenly drew away and stared at me

Butthat is very strange I

She had gone pale I saw that now And quite suddenly she dropped her
knittingbag When I restored it to her she was very calm and poised
but her color had not come back

It has always been very satisfactory she said I dont know that it
ever

She considered and began again Why not just ignore it If some one is
playing a malicious trick on you the only thing is to ignore it

Her hands were shaking although her voice was quiet I saw that when
she tried to tie the ribbons of the bag AndI wondered at this in so
gentle a soulthere was a hint of anger in her tones There was an edge
to her voice

That she could be angry was a surprise And I found that she could also
be obstinate For we came to an impasse over the telephone in the next
few minutes and over something so absurd that I was nonplussed It was
over her unqualified refusal to allow me to install a branch wire to my
bedroom

But I expostulated when one thinks of the convenience and

I am sorry Her voice had a note of finality I daresay I am
oldfashioned butI do not like changes I shall have to ask you not
to interfere with the telephone

I could hardly credit my senses Her tone was one of reproof plus
decision It convicted me of an indiscretion If I had asked to take
the roof off and replace it with silk umbrellas it might have been
justified But to a request to move the telephone

Of course if you feel that way about it I said I shall not touch
it

I dropped the subject a trifle ruffled I confess and went upstairs to
fetch a box in which Miss Emily was to carry away some flowers from the
garden

It was when I was coming down the staircase that I saw Maggie She had
carried the hall candlesticks newly polished to their places on
the table and was standing a hand on each one staring into the old
Washington mirror in front of her From where she was she must have had
a full view of Miss Emily in the library And Maggie was bristling It
was the only word for it

She was still there when Miss Emily had gone blowing on the mirror and
polishing it And I took her to task for her unfriendly attitude to the
little old lady

You practically threw her muffins at her I said And I must speak
again about the cups

What does she come snooping around for anyhow she broke in Arent
we paying for her house Didnt she get down on her bended knees and beg
us to take it

Is that any reason why we should be uncivil

What I want to know is this Maggie said truculently What right
has she to come back and spy on us For thats what shes doing Miss
Agnes Do you know what she was at when I looked in at her She was
running a finger along the baseboard to see if it was clean And whats
more I caught her at it once before in the back hall when she was
pretending to telephone for the station hack

It was that day I think that I put fresh candles in all the holders
downstairs I had made a resolution like thisto renew the candles
and to lock myself in my room and throw the key over the transom to
Maggie If in the mornings that followed the candles had been used it
would prove that Martin Sprague was wrong that even footprints could
lie and that some one was investigating the lower floor at night
For while my reason told me that I had been the intruder my intuition
continued to insist that my sleepwalking was a result not a cause In
a word I had gone downstairs because I knew that there had been and
might be again a night visitor

Yet there was something of comedy in that nights precautions after
all

At tenthirty I was undressed and Maggie had with rebellion in every
line of her locked me in I could hear her afterwards running along
the hall to her own room and slamming the door Then a moment later
the telephone rang

It was too early I reasoned for the night calls It might be anything
a telegram at the station Willies boy run over by an automobile
Gertrudes children ill A dozen possibilities ran through my mind

And Maggie would not let me out

Youre not going downstairs she called from a safe distance

Maggie I cried sharply And banged at the door The telephone was
ringing steadily Come here at once

Miss Agnes she beseeched you go to bed and dont listen Therell
be nothing there for all your trouble she said in a quavering voice
Its nothing human that rings that bell

Finally however she freed me and I went down the stairs I had
carried down a lamp and my nerves were vibrating to the rhythm of the
bells shrill summons But strangely enough the fear had left me
I find as always that it is difficult to put into words I did not
relish the excursion to the lower floor I resented the jarring sound of
the bell But the terror was gone

I went back to the telephone Something that was living and moving was
there I saw its eyes lower than mine reflecting the lamp like twin
lights I was frightened but still it was not the fear The twin lights
leaped forwardand proved to be the eyes of Miss Emilys cat which had
been sleeping on the stand

I answered the telephone To my surprise it was Miss Emily herself a
quiet and very dignified voice which apologized for disturbing me at
that hour and went on

I feel that I was very abrupt this afternoon Miss Blakiston My excuse
is that I have always feared change I have lived in a rut too long Im
afraid But of course if you feel you would like to move the telephone
or put in an upstairs instrument you may do as you like

She seemed having got me there unwilling to ring off I got a curious
effect of reluctance over the telephone and there was one phrase that
she repeated several times

I do not want to influence you I want you to do just what you think
best

The fear was entirely gone by the time she rang off I felt instead a
sort of relaxation that was most comforting The rear hall a culdesac
of nervousness in the daytime and of horror at night was suddenly
transformed by the light of my lamp into a warm and cheerful refuge from
the darkness of the lower floor The purring of the cat comfortably
settled on the telephonestand was as cheering as the singing of a
kettle on a stove On the rack near me my garden hat and an old Paisley
shawl made a grotesque human effigy

I sat back in the low wicker chair and surveyed the hallway Why not I
considered do away now with the fear of it If I could conquer it like
this at midnight I need never succumb again to it in the light

The cat leaped to the stand beside me and stood there waiting He was
an intelligent animal and I am like a good many spinsters I am not
more fond of cats than other people but I understand them better And
it seemed to me that he and I were going through some familiar program
of which a part had been neglected The cat neither sat nor lay but
stood there waiting

So at last I fetched the shawl from the rack and made him a bed on
the stand It was what he had been waiting for I saw that at once He
walked onto it turned around once lay down and closed his eyes

I took up my vigil I had been the victim of a fear I was determined to
conquer The house was quiet Maggie had retired shriveled to bed The
cat slept on the shawl

And thenI felt the fear returning It welled up through my
tranquillity like a flood and swept me with it I wanted to shriek I
was afraid to shriek I longed to escape I dared not move There had
been no sound no motion Things were as they had been

It may have been one minute or five that I sat there I do not know
I only know that I sat with fixed eyes not even blinking for fear of
even for a second shutting out the sane and visible world about me A
sense of deadness commenced in my hands and worked up my arms My chest
seemed flattened

Then the telephone bell rang

The cat leaped to his feet Somehow I reached forward and took down the
receiver

Who is it I cried in a voice that was thin I knew and unnatural

The telephone is not a perfect medium It loses much that we wish
to register but also it registers much that we may wish to lose
Therefore when I say that I distinctly heard a gasp followed by heavy
difficult breathing over the telephone I must beg for credence It is
true Some one at the other end of the line was struggling for breath

Then there was complete silence I realized after a moment that the
circuit had been stealthily cut and that my conviction was verified
by Centrals demand a moment later of what number I wanted I was at
first unable to answer her When I did speak my voice was shaken

What number please she repeated in a bored tone There is
nothing in all the world so bored as the voice of a small town
telephoneoperator

You called I said

Beg ypardon Must have been a mistake she replied glibly and cut me
off




II


It may be said and with truth that so far I have recorded little
but subjective terror possibly easily explained by my occupancy of an
isolated house plus a few unimportant incidents capable of various
interpretations But the fear was and is today as I look back a real
thing As realand as difficult to describeas a chill for instance
A severe mental chill it was indeed

I went upstairs finally to a restless night and rose early after only
an hour or so of sleep One thing I was determined onto find out
if possible the connection between the terror and the telephone I
breakfasted early and was dressing to go to the village when I had
a visitor no other than Miss Emily herself She looked fluttered and
perturbed at the unceremonious hour of her visitshe was the soul of
conventionand explained between breaths as it were that she had come
to apologize for the day before She had hardly slept I must forgive
her She had been very nervous since her brothers death and small
things upset her

How much of what I say of Miss Emily depends on my later knowledge I
wonder Did I notice then that she was watching me furtively or is it
only on looking back that I recall it I do recall itthe hall door
open and a vista of smiling garden beyond and silhouetted against the
sunshine Miss Emilys frail figure and searching slightly uplifted
face There was something in her eyes that I had not seen beforea
sort of exaltation She was not that morning the Miss Emily who ran a
finger along her baseboards to see if we dusted them

She had walked out and it had exhausted her She breathed in little
gasps

I think she said at last that I must telephone for Mr Staley I am
never very strong in hot weather

Please let me call him for you Miss Emily I am not a young woman
and she was at least sixtyfive But because she was so small and
frail I felt almost a motherly anxiety for her that morning

I think I should like to do it if you dont mind We are old friends
He always comes promptly when I call him

She went back alone and I waited in the doorway When she came out she
was smiling and there was more color in her face

He is coming at once He is always very thoughtful for me

Now without any warning something that had been seething since her
breathless arrival took shape in my mind and becamesuspicion What
if it had been Miss Emily who had called me the second time to the
telephone and having established the connection had waited breathing
hard forwhat

It was fantastic incredible in the light of that brilliant summer day
I looked at her dainty and exquisite as ever her ruchings fresh and
white her very face indicative of decorum and order her wistful old
mouth still rather like a childs her eyes always slightly upturned
because of her diminutive height so that she had habitually a look of
adoration

One of earths saints the rector had said to me on Sunday morning A
good woman Miss Blakiston and a sacrifice to an unworthy family

Suspicion is like the rain It falls on the just and on the unjust And
that morning I began to suspect Miss Emily I had no idea of what

On my mentioning an errand in the village she promptly offered to take
me with her in the Staley hack She had completely altered in manner
The strain was gone In her soft low voice as we made our way to the
road she told me the stories of some of the garden flowers

The climbing rose over the arch my dear she said my mother brought
from England on her wedding journey People have taken cuttings from it
again and again but the cuttings never thrive A bad winter and they
are gone But this one has lived Of course now and then it freezes
down

She chattered on and my suspicions grew more and more shadowy They
would have gone I think had not Maggie called me back with a grocery
list

A sack of flour she said and some green vegetables andMiss
Agnes that woman was down on her knees beside the telephoneand
bluing for the laundry and I guess thats all

The telephone It was always the telephone We drove on down the lane
eyed somnolently by spotted cows and incurious sheep and all the way
Miss Emily talked She was almost garrulous She asked the hackman about
his family and stopped the vehicle to pick up a peddler overburdened
with his pack I watched her with amazement Evidently this was Mr
Staleys Miss Emily But it was not mine

But I saw mine too that morning It was when I asked the hackman to
put me down at the little telephone building I thought she put her
hand to her throat although the next moment she was only adjusting the
ruching at her neck

Youyou have decided to have the second telephone put in then

I hesitated She so obviously did not want it installed And was I to
submit meekly to the fear again without another effort to vanquish it

I think not dear Miss Emily I said at last smiling at her drawn
face Why should I disturb your lovely old house and its established
order

But I want you to do just what you think best she protested She had
put her hands together It was almost a supplication

As to the strange night calls there was little to be learned The
night operator was in bed The manager made a note of my complaint and
promised an investigation which having had experience with telephone
investigations I felt would lead nowhere I left the building with my
grocery list in my hand

The hack was gone of course ButI may have imagined itI thought
I saw Miss Emily peering at me from behind the bonnets and hats in the
milliners window

I did not investigate The thing was enough on my nerves as it was

Maggie served me my luncheon in a sort of strained silence She observed
once as she brought me my tea that she was giving me notice and
intended leaving on the afternoon train She had she stated holding
out the sugarbowl to me at arms length stood a great deal in the way
of irregular hours from me seeing as I would read myself to sleep and
let the light burn all night although very fussy about the gasbills
But she had reached the end of her tether and you could grate a lemon
on her most anywhere she was that covered with gooseflesh

Gooseflesh about what I demanded And either throw the sugar to me
or come closer

I dont know about what she said sullenly Im just scared

And for once Maggie and I were in complete harmony I too was just
scared

We were however both of us much nearer a solution of our troubles
than we had any idea of I say solution although it but substituted one
mystery for another It gave tangibility to the intangible indeed
but I can not see that our situation was any better I for one found
myself in the position of having a problem to solve and no formula to
solve it with

The afternoon was quiet Maggie and the cook were in the throes of
jellymaking and I had picked up a narrative history of the county
written most pedantically although with here and there a touch of heavy
lightness by Miss Emilys father the Reverend Samuel Thaddeus Benton

On the flyleaf she had inscribed Written by my dear father during the
last year of his life and published after his death by the parish to
which he had given so much of his noble life

The book left me cold but the inscription warmed me Whatever feeling I
might have had about Miss Emily died of that inscription A devoted and
selfsacrificing daughter a woman both loving and beloved that was the
Miss Emily of the dedication to Fifty years in Bolivar County

In the middle of the afternoon Maggie appeared with a saucer and a
teaspoon In the saucer she had poured a little of the jelly to test it
and she was blowing on it when she entered I put down my book

Well I said Dont tell me youre not dressed yet Youve just got
about time for the afternoon train

She gave me an imploring glance over the saucer

You might just take a look at this Miss Agnes she said It jells
around the edges but in the middle

Ill send your trunk tomorrow I said and youd better let Delia
make the jelly alone You havent much time and she says she makes good
jelly

She raised anguished eyes to mine

Miss Agnes she said that womans never made a glass of jelly in her
life before She didnt even know about putting a silver spoon in the
tumblers to keep em from breaking

I picked up Bolivar County and opened it but I could see that the
hands holding the saucer were shaking

Im not going Miss Agnes said Maggie I had of course known she
would not The surprising thing to me is that she never learns this
fact although she gives me notice quite regularly She always thinks
that she is really going until the last Of course you can let that
woman make the jelly if you want Its your fruit and sugar But Im
not going to desert you in your hour of need

What do I need I demanded Jelly

But she was past sarcasm She placed the saucer on a table and rolled
her stained hands in her apron

That woman she said what was she doing under the telephone stand

She almost immediately burst into tears and it was some time before I
caught what she feared For she was more concrete than I And she knew
now what she was afraid of It was either a bomb or fire

Mark my words Miss Agnes she said shes going to destroy the
place What made her set out and rent it for almost nothing if she
isnt And I know who rings the telephone at night Its her

What on earth for I demanded as ungrammatical and hardly less uneasy
than Maggie

She wakes us up so we can get out in time Shes a preachers
daughter More than likely she draws the line at bloodshed Thats one
reason Maybe theres another What if by pressing a button somewhere
and ringing that bell it sets off a bomb somewhere

It never has I observed dryly

But however absurd Maggies logic might be she was firm in her
major premise Miss Emily had been on her hands and knees by the
telephonestand and had on seeing Maggie observed that she had
dropped the money for the hackman out of her glove

Which I dont believe Her gloves were on the stand If youll come
back Miss Agnes Ill show you how she was

We made rather an absurd procession Maggie leading with the saucer I
following and the cat appearing from nowhere as usual bringing up the
rear Maggie placed the jelly on the stand and dropped on her hands
and knees crawling under the stand a confused huddle of gingham apron
jellystains and suspicion

She had her head down like this she said in rather a smothered
voice Im her and youre me And I says If its rolled off
somewhere Ill find it next time I sweep and give it back to you
Well what dyou think of that Here it is

My attention had by this time been caught by the jelly now unmistakably
solidifying in the center I moved to the kitchen door to tell Delia
to take it off the fire When I returned Maggie was digging under the
telephone batterybox with a hairpin and muttering to herself

Darnation she said its gone under

If you do get it I reminded her it belongs to Miss Emily

There is a curious strain of cupidity in Maggie I have never been able
to understand it With her own money she is as free as air But let her
see a chance for illegitimate gain of finding a penny on the street
of not paying her fare on the cars of passing a bad quarter and she is
filled with an unholy joy And so today The jelly was forgotten Terror
was gone All that existed for Maggie was a twentyfive cent piece under
a batterybox

Suddenly she wailed Its gone Miss Agnes Its clear under

Good heavens Maggie What difference does it make

Wyou mind if I got the icepick and unscrewed the box

My menage is always notoriously short of tools

I forbade it at once and ordered her back to the kitchen and after a
final squint along the carpet head flat she dragged herself out and to
her feet

Ill get the jelly off she said and then maybe a hat pinll reach
it I can see the edge of it

A loud crack from the kitchen announced that cook had forgotten the
silver spoon and took Maggie off on a jump I went back to the library
and Bolivar County and I must confess to a nap in my chair

I was roused by the feeling that some one was staring at me My eyes
focused first on the icepick then as I slowly raised them on Maggies
face set in hard and uncompromising lines

Id thank you to come with me she said stiffly

Come where

To the telephone

I groaned inwardly But because submission to Maggies tyranny has
become a firm habit with me I rose I saw then that she held a dingy
quarter in one hand

Without a word she turned and stalked ahead of me into the hall It is
curious looking back and remembering that she had then no knowledge of
the significance of things to remember how hard and inexorable her back
was Viewed through the light of what followed I have never been able
to visualize Maggie moving down the hall It has always been a menacing
figure rather shadowy than real And the hail itself takes on grotesque
proportions becomes inordinately long an infinity of hall fading away
into time and distance

Yet it was only a moment of course until I stood by the telephone
Maggie had been at work The wooden box which covered the batteryjars
had been removed and lay on its side The batteryjars were uncovered
giving an effect of mystery unveiled a sort of shamelessness of
destroyed illusion

Maggie pointed Theres a paper under one of the jars she said I
havent touched it but I know well enough what it is

I have not questioned Maggie on this point but I am convinced that she
expected to find a sort of final summons of deaths visitingcard for
one or the other of us

The paper was there a small folded scrap partially concealed under a
jar

Them prints was there too Maggie said noncommittally

The box had accumulated the flocculent floating particles of months
possibly yearslint from the hall carpet giving it a reddish tinge And
in this light and evanescent deposit fluttered by a breath fingers
had moved searched I am tempted to say groped although the word seems
absurd for anything so small The imprint of Maggies coin and of her
attempts at salvage were at the edge and quite distinct from the others

I lifted the jar and picked up the paper It was folded and refolded
until it was not much larger than a thumbnail a rather stiff paper
crossed with faint blue lines I am not sure that I would have opened
itit had been so plainly in hiding and was so obviously not my
affairhad not Maggie suddenly gasped and implored me not to look at
it I immediately determined to examine it

Yet after I had read it twice it had hardly made an impression on my
mind There are some things so incredible that the brain automatically
rejects them I looked at the paper I read it with my eyes But I did
not grasp it

It was not note paper It was apparently torn from a tablet of glazed
and ruled paperjust such paper for instance as Maggie soaks in
brandy and places on top of her jelly before tying it up It had been
raggedly torn The scrap was the full width of the sheet but only three
inches or so deep It was undated and this is what it said

To Whom it may concern On the 30th day of May 1911 I killed a woman
here in this house I hope you will not find this until I am dead

Signed EMILY BENTON

Maggie had read the confession over my shoulder and I felt her
body grow rigid As for myself my first sensation was one of acute
discomfortthat we should have exposed the confession to the light
of day Neither of us I am sure had really grasped it Maggie put a
trembling hand on my arm

The brass of her she said in a thin terrified voice And sitting
in church like the rest of us Oh my God Miss Agnes put it back

I whirled on her in a fury that was only an outlet for my own shock

Once for all Maggie I said Ill ask you to wait until you are
spoken to And if I hear that you have so much as mentioned thispiece
of paper out you go and never come back

But she was beyond apprehension She was literal too She saw not Miss
Emily unbelievably associated with a crime but the crime itself Who
dyou suppose it was Miss Agnes

I dont believe it at all Some one has placed it there to hurt Miss
Emily

Its her writing said Maggie doggedly

After a time I got rid of her and sat down to think in the library
Rather I sat down to reason with myself

For every atom of my brain was clamoring that this thing was true that
my little Miss Emily exquisite and fine as she was had done the thing
she claimed to have done It was her own writing thin faintly shaded
as neat and as erect as herself But even that I would not accept
until I had compared it with such bits of hers as I possessed the note
begging me to take the house the inscription on the flyleaf of Fifty
Years in Bolivar County

And here was something I could not quite understand The writing was all
of the same order but while the confession and the inscription in
the book were similar letter for letter in the note to me there were
differences a change in the t in Benton a fuller and blacker
stroke a variation in the terminals of the lettersit is hard to
particularize

I spent the remainder of the day in the library going out for dinner
of course but returning to my refuge again immediately after Only in
the library am I safe from Maggie By virtue of her responsibility for
my wardrobe she virtually shares my bedroom but her respect for books
she never reads makes her regard a library as at least semiholy ground
She dusts books with more caution than china and her respect for a
family Bible is greater than her respect for me

I spent the evening there Miss Emilys cat on the divan and the
mysterious confession lying before me under the lamp At night the
variation between it and her note to me concerning the house seemed more
pronounced The note looked more like a clumsy imitation of Miss Emilys
own hand Orperhaps this is neareras if after writing in a certain
way for sixty years she had tried to change her style

All my logic ended in one conclusion She must have known the confession
was there Therefore the chances were that she had placed it there But
it was not so simple as that

Both crime and confession indicated a degree of impulse that Miss Emily
did not possess I have entirely failed with my picture of Miss Emily if
the word violence can be associated with her in any way Miss Emily
was a temple clean swept cold and empty She never acted on impulse
Every action almost every word seemed the result of thought and
deliberation

Yet if I could believe my eyes five years before she had killed a
woman in this very house Possibly in the very room in which I was then
sitting

I find on looking back that the terror must have left me that day
It had for so many weeks been so much a part of my daily life that
I would have missed it had it not been for this new and engrossing
interest I remember that the long French windows of the library
reflected the room like mirrors against the darkness outside and that
once I thought I saw a shadowy movement in one of them as though a
figure moved behind me But when I turned sharply there was no one
there and Maggie proved to be as usual after nine oclock shut away
upstairs

I was not terrified And indeed the fear never returned In all
the course of my investigations I was never again a victim of the
unreasoning fright of those earlier days

My difficulty was that I was asked to believe the unbelievable It was
impossible to reconstruct in that quiet house a scene of violence It
was equally impossible in view for instance of that calm and filial
inscription in the history of Bolivar County to connect Miss Emily with
it She had killed a woman forsooth Miss Emily of the baby afghans
of the weary peddler of that quiet seat in the church

Yet I knew now that Miss Emily knew of the confession knew at least
of something concealed in that corner of the rear hall which housed the
telephone Had she by chance an enemy who would have done this thing
But to suspect Miss Emily of an enemy was as absurd as to suspect her of
a crime

I was completely at a loss when I put out the lights and prepared to
close the house As I glanced back along the hall I could not help
wondering if the telephone having given up its secret would continue
its nocturnal alarms As I stood there I heard the low growl of thunder
and the patter of rain against the windows Partly out of loneliness
partly out of bravado I went back to the telephone and tried to call
Willie But the line was out of order

I slept badly Shortly after I returned I heard a door slamming
repeatedly which I knew meant an open window somewhere I got up and
went into the hall There was a cold air coming from somewhere below
But as I stood there it ceased The door above stopped slamming and
silence reigned again

Maggie roused me early The morning sunlight was just creeping into the
room and the air was still cool with the night and freshwashed by the
storm

Miss Agnes she demanded standing over me did you let the cat out
last night

I brought him in before I went to bed

Humph said Maggie And did I or did I not wash the doorstep
yesterday

You ought to know You said you did

Miss Agnes Maggie said that woman was in this house last night You
can see her footprints as plain as day on the doorstep And whats more
she stole the cat and let out your mothers Paisley shawl

Which statements corrected proved to be true My old Paisley shawl was
gone from the hallrack and unquestionably the cat had been on the back
doorstep that morning along with the milk bottles Moreover one of my
fresh candles had been lighted but had burned for only a moment or two

That day I had a second visit from young Martin Sprague The telephone
was in working order again having unaccountably recovered and I was
using it when he came He watched me quizzically from a position by the
newelpost as I rang off

I was calling Miss Emily Benton I explained but she is ill

Still troubled with telephobia

I have other things to worry me Martin I said gravely and let him
into the library

There I made a clean breast of everything I omitted nothing The fear
the strange ringing of the telephone bell the gasping breathing over it
the night before Miss Emilys visit to it And at last the discovery

He took the paper when I offered it to him and examined it carefully by
a window Then he stood looking out and whistling reflectively At last
he turned back to the room

Its an unusual story he said But if youll give me a little time
Ill explain it to you In the first place let go of the material
things for a moment and lets deal with minds and emotions Youre a
sensitive person Miss Agnes You catch a lot of impressions that pass
most people by And first of all youve been catching fright from two
sources

Two sources

Two Maggie is one She hates the country She is afraid of old houses
And she sees in this house only the ghosts of people who have died
here

I pay no attention to Maggies fears

You only think that But to go furtheryou have been receiving waves
of apprehension from another sourcefrom the little lady Miss Emily

Then you think

Hold on he said smiling I think she wrote that confession Yes
As a matter of fact Im quite sure she did And she has established
a system of espionage on you by means of the telephone If you had
discovered the confession she knew that there would be a change in your
voice in your manner If you answered very quickly as though you had
been near the instrument perhaps in the very act of discovering the
paperdont you get it And cant you see how her terror affected you
even over the wire Dont you think that if thought can travel untold
distances fear can Of course

But Martin I exclaimed Little Miss Emily a murderess

He threw up his hands

Certainly not he said Youre a shrewd woman Miss Agnes Do you
know that a certain type of woman frequently confesses to a crime she
never committed or had any chance of committing Look at the police
recordsconfessions of women as to crimes they could only have heard
of through the newspapers I would like to wager that if we had the
newspapers of that date that came into this house we would find a
particularly atrocious and mysterious murder being featuredthe murder
of a woman

You do not know her I maintained doggedly And drew as best I could
a sketch of Miss Emily while he listened attentively

A pure neurasthenic type was his comment Older than usual but that
is accountable by the sheltered life she has led The little Miss Emily
is still at heart a girl And a hysterical girl

She has had enough trouble to develop her

Trouble Has she ever had a genuine emotion Look at this house She
nursed an old father in it a bedridden mother a paretic brother when
she should have been having children Dont you see it Miss Agnes All
her emotions have had to be mental Failing them outside she provided
them for herself This he tapped the paper in his handthis is
one

I had heard of people confessing to crimes they had never committed and
at the time Martin Sprague at least partly convinced me He was so sure
of himself And when that afternoon he telephoned me from the city to
say that he was mailing out some old newspapers I knew quite well what
he had found

Ive thought of something else Miss Agnes he said If youll look
it up you will probably find that the little lady had had either a shock
sometime before that or a long pull of nursing Something anyhow to
set her nervous system to going in the wrong direction

Late that afternoon as it happened I was enabled to learn something
of this from a visiting neighbor and once again I was forced to
acknowledge that he might be right

The neighbors had not been over cordial I had gathered from the first
the impression that the members of the Reverend Samuel Thaddeus Bentons
congregation did not fancy an interloper among the sacred relics of
the historian of Bolivar County And I had a corroboration of that
impression from my visitor of that afternoon a Mrs Graves

Ive been slow in coming Miss Blakiston she said seating herself
primly I dont suppose you can understand but this has always been
the Benton place and it seems strange to us to see new faces here

I replied with some asperity that I had not been anxious to take the
house but that Miss Emily had been so insistent that I had finally done
so

It seemed to me that she flashed a quick glance at me

She is quite the most loved person in the valley she said And she
loves the place It isI cannot imagine why she rented the house She
is far from comfortable where she is

After a time I gathered that she suspected financial stringency as the
cause and I tried to set her mind at rest

It cannot be money I said The rent is absurdly low The agent
wished her to ask more but she refused

She sat silent for a time pulling at the fingers of her white silk
gloves And when she spoke again it was of the garden But before she
left she returned to Miss Emily

She has had a hard life in a way she said It is only five years
since she buried her brother and her father not long before that She
has broken a great deal since then Not that the brother

I understand he was a great care

Mrs Graves looked about the room its shelves piled high with the
ecclesiastical library of the late clergyman

It was not only that she said When he wasall right he was an
atheist Imagine in this house He had the most terrible books Miss
Blakiston And of course when a man believes there is no hereafter he
is apt to lead a wicked life There is nothing to hold him back

Her mind was on Miss Emily and her problems She moved abstractedly
toward the door

In this very hall she said I helped Miss Emily to pack all his
books into a box and we sent for Mr Staleythe hackman at the
station you knowand he dumped the whole thing into the river We went
away with him and how she cheered up when it was done

Martin Spragues newspapers arrived the next morning They bore a date
of two days before the date of the confession and contained rather
triumphantly outlined in blue pencil full details of the murder of a
young woman by some unknown assassin It had been a grisly crime and
the paper was filled with details of a most sensational sort

Had I been asked I would have said that Miss Emilys clear slightly
upturned eyes had never glanced beyond the merest headlines of such
journalistic reports But in a letter Martin Sprague set forth a
precisely opposite view

You will probably find he wrote that the little lady is pretty well
fed up on such stuff The calmer and more placid the daily life the
more apt is the secret inner one in such a circumscribed existence to
be a thriller You might look over the books in the house There is a
historic case where a young girl swore she had tossed her little brother
to a den of lions although there were no lions near and little brother
was subsequently found asleep in the attic after reading Foxs Book of
Martyrs Probably the old gentleman has this joke book in his library

I put down his letter and glanced around the room Was he right after
all Did women rational truthful devout women ever act in this
strange manner And if it was true was it not in its own way as
mysterious as everything else

I was for a time that day strongly influenced by Martin Spragues
conviction It was for one thing easier to believe than that Emily
Benton had committed a crime And as if to lend color to his assertion
the sunlight falling onto the dreary bookshelves picked out and
illuminated dull gilt letters on the brown back of a volume It was
Foxs Book of Martyrs

If I may analyze my sensations at that time they divided themselves
into three parts The first was fear That seems to have given away to
curiosity and that at a later period to an intense anxiety Of the
three I have no excuse for the second save the one I gave myself at
the timethat Miss Emily could not possibly have done the thing she
claimed to have done and that I must prove her innocence to myself

With regard to Martin Spragues theory I was divided I wanted him
to be right I wanted him to be wrong No picture I could visualize of
little old Miss Emily conceivably fitted the type he had drawn On the
other hand nothing about her could possibly confirm the confession as
an actual one

The scrap of paper became for the time my universe Did I close my
eyes I saw it side by side with the inscription in Fifty years of my
Bolivar County and letter for letter in the same hand Did the sun
shine I had it in the light examining it reading it To such a point
did it obsess me that I refused to allow Maggie to use a tablet of
glazed paper she had found in the kitchen table drawer to tie up the
jellyglasses It seemed somehow horrible to me

At that time I had no thought of going back five years and trying to
trace the accuracy or falsehood of the confession I should not have
known how to go about it Had such a crime been committed how to
discover it at this late day Whom in all her sheltered life could Miss
Emily have murdered In her small world who could have fallen out and
left no sign

It was impossible and I knew it And yet

Miss Emily was ill The news came through the grocery boy who came
out every day on a bicycle and teased the cat and carried away all
the pears as fast as they ripened Maggie brought me the information at
luncheon

Shes sick she said

There was only one person in both our minds those days

Do you mean really ill or only

The boy says shes breaking up If you ask me she caught cold the
night she broke in here and took your Paisley shawl And if you ask my
advice Miss Agnes youll get it back again before the heirs step in
and claim it They dont make them shawls nowadays and shes as like as
not to will it to somebody if you dont go after it

Maggie I said quietly how do you know she has that shawl

How did I know that paper was in the telephonebox she countered

And indeed by that time Maggie had convinced herself that she had
known all along there was something in the telephone batterybox

Ive a sort of second sight Miss Agnes she added And with a
shrewdness I found later was partially correct She was snooping around
to see if youd found that paper and it came on to rain so she took
the shawl I should say said Maggie lowering her voice that as like
as not shes been in this house every night since we came

Late that afternoon I cut some of the roses from the arch for Miss
Emily and wrapping them against the sun carried them to the village
At the last I hesitated It was so much like prying I turned aside at
the church intending to leave them there for the altar But I could find
no one in the parish house and no vessel to hold them

It was late afternoon I opened a door and stepped into the old church
I knelt for a moment and then sat back and surveyed the quiet building
It occurred to me that here one could obtain a real conception of the
Benton family and of Miss Emily The church had been the realest thing
in their lives It had dominated them obsessed them When the Reverend
Samuel Thaddeus died they had built him not a monument but a parish
house When Carlo Benton died however did such an ungodly name come to
belong to a Benton Miss Emily according to the story had done without
fresh mourning and built him a window

I looked at the window It was extremely ugly and very devout And
under it was the dead mans name and two dates 1860 and 1911

So Carlo Benton had died the year Miss Emily claimed to have done a
murder Another proof I reflected that Martin Sprague would say He had
been on her hands for a long time both well and ill Small wonder if
little Miss Emily had fallen to imagining things or to confessing them

I looked at the memorial window once more and I could almost visualize
her gathering up the dead mans hateful books and getting them
as quickly as possible out of the house Quite possibly there were
unmentionable volumes among themde Maupassant perhaps Boccaccio I
had a distinct picture too of Mrs Graves lips primly set assisting
her with hands that fairly itched with the righteousness of her actions

I still held the roses and as I left the church I decided to lay them
on some grave in the churchyard I thought it quite likely that roses
from the same arch had been frequently used for that purpose Some very
young grave I said to myself and found one soon enough a bit of a
rectangle of fresh earth and a jarful of pansies on it It lay in the
shadow of the Benton mausoleum

That was how I found that Carlo Benton had died on the 27th of May
1911

I cannot claim that the fact at the time had any significance for me
or that I saw in it anything more than another verification of Martin
Spragues solution But it enabled me to reconstruct the Benton
household at the date that had grown so significant The 30th would have
probably been the day after the funeral Perhaps the nurse was still
there He had had a nurse for months according to Mrs Graves And
there would have been the airing that follows long illness and death
the opened windows the packing up or giving away of clothing the
pauses and silences the sense of strangeness and quiet the lowered
voices And there would have been too that remorseless packing for
destruction of the dead atheists books

And some time during that day or the night that followed little Miss
Emily claimed to have committed her crime

I went home thoughtfully At the gate I turned and looked back The
Benton Mausoleum was warm in the sunset and the rose sprays lay like
outstretched arms across the tiny grave

Maggie is amazingly efficient I am efficient myself I trust but
I modify it with intelligence It is not to me a vital matter for
instance if three dozen glasses of jelly sit on a kitchen table a day
or two after they are prepared for retirement to the fruit cellar
I rather like to see them marshaled in their neat rows capped with
sealing wax and paper and armed with labels But Maggie has neither
sentiment nor imagination Jelly to her is an institution not an
inspiration It is subject to certain rules and rites of which not the
least is the formal interment in the fruit closet

Therefore after much protesting that night I agreed to visit the fruit
cellar and select a spot for the temporary entombing of thirtysix
jelly tumblers which would have been thirtyseven had Delia known the
efficacy of a silver spoon I can recall vividly the mental shift from
the confession to that domestic excursion my own impatience Maggies
grim determination and the curious denouement of that visit




III


I had the very slightest acquaintance with the basement of the Benton
house I knew it was dry and orderly and with that my interest in it
ceased It was not cemented but its hard clay floor was almost as solid
as macadam In one end was built a high potatobin In another corner
two or three old pews from the church evidently long discarded and
showing weatherstains as though they had once served as garden
benches were upended against the whitewashed wall The fruitcloset
built in of lumber occupied one entire end and was virtually a room
with a door and no windows

Maggie had she said found it locked and had had an itinerant locksmith
fit a key to it

Its all scrubbed and ready she said I found that preserved
melonrind you had for lunch in a corner Twouldnt of kept much
longer so I took it up and opened it Shes probably got all sorts of
stuff spoiling in the locked part Some folksre like that

Most of the shelves were open but now holding the lamp high I saw
that a closet with a door occupied one end The door was padlocked At
the time I was interested but I was as I remember much more occupied
with Maggies sense of meum and tuum which I considered deficient and
of a small lecture on other peoples melon rinds which I delivered as
she sullenly put away the jelly

But that night after I had gone to bed the memory of that padlock
became strangely insistent There was nothing psychic about the feeling
I had It was perfectly obvious and simple The house held or had held
a secret Yet it was above stairs as open as the day There was no
corner into which I might not peer exceptWhy was that portion of the
fruitcloset locked

At two oclock finding myself unable to sleep I got up and put on my
dressinggown and slippers I had refused to repeat the experiment
of being locked in Then with a candle and a box of matches I went
downstairs I had as I have said no longer any terror of the lower
floor The cat lay as usual on the table in the back hall I saw his
eyes watching me with their curious unblinking stare as intelligent as
two brass buttons He rose as my light approached and I made a bed for
him of a cushion from a chair failing my Paisley shawl

It was after that that I had the curious sense of being led It was
as though I knew that something awaited my discovery and that my sole
volition was whether I should make that discovery or not It was there
waiting

I have no explanation for this And it is quite possible that I might
have had it to find at the end nothing more significant than rootbeer
for instance or bulbs for the winter garden

And indeed at first sight what awaited me in the locked closet
amounted to anticlimax For when I had broken the rusty padlock open
with a hatchet and had opened doors with nervous fingers nothing more
startling appeared than a number of books The shelves were piled high
with them a motley crew of all colors but dark shades predominating

I went back to bed sheepishly enough and wrapped my chilled feet in an
extra blanket Maggie came to the door about the time I was dozing off
and said she had heard hammering downstairs in the cellar some time ago
but she had refused to waken me until the burglars had gone

If it was burglars she added youre that upandready Miss Agnes
that I knew if I waked you youd be downstairs after them Whats a bit
of silver to a human life

I got her away at last and she went muttering something about digging
up the cellar floor and finding an uneasy spirit Then I fell asleep

I had taken cold that night and the following morning I spent in bed
At noon Maggie came upstairs holding at arms length a book She kept
her face averted and gave me a slanting and outraged glance

This is a nice place weve come to she said acidly Murder in the
telephone and antiChrist in the fruit cellar

Why Maggie I expostulated

If these books stay I go and thats flat Miss Agnes was her ipse
dixit She dropped the book on the bed and stalked out pausing at the
door only to throw back If this is a clergymans house I guess Id be
better out of the church

I took up the book It was wellworn and in the front in a heavy
masculine hand the owner had written his namewritten it large a bit
defiantly perhaps It had taken both courage and conviction to bring
such a book into that devout household

I am not quick mentally especially when it comes to logical thought I
daresay I am intuitive rather than logical It was not by any process
of reasoning at all I fancy that it suddenly seemed strange that there
should be books locked away in the cellar Yet it was strange For that
had been a bookish household Books were its stock in trade one may
say Such as I had borrowed from the library had been carefully
tended Torn leaves were neatly repaired The reference books were
alphabetically arranged And looking back on my visit to the cellar I
recalled now as inconsistent the disorder of those basement shelves

I did not reach the truth until that afternoon I made a second visit
to the cellar Mrs Graves had been mistaken If not all Carlo Bentons
proscribed books were hidden there at least a large portion of his
library was piled in something like confusion on the shelves Yet she
maintained that they had searched the house and she herself had been
present when the books were packed and taken away to the river

That afternoon I returned Mrs Gravess visit She was at home and in a
sort of flurried neatness that convinced me she had seen me from far up
the road That conviction was increased by the amazing promptness with
which a teatray followed my entrance I had given her tea the day she
came to see me and she was not to be outdone Indeed I somehow gained
the impression that tray and teapot and even little cakes had been
waiting day by day for my anticipated visit

It was not hard to set her talking of Carlo Benton and his wickedness
She rose to the bait like a hungry fish Yet I gathered that beyond his
religious views or lack of them she knew nothing But on the matter of
the books she was firm

After the box was ready she said we went to every room and searched
it Miss Emily was set on clearing out every trace At the last minute
I found one called The Fallacy of Christianity slipped down behind the
dresser in his room and we put that in

It was The Fallacy of Christianity that Maggie had brought me that
morning

It is a most interesting story I observed What delicious tea Mrs
Graves And then you fastened up the box and saw it thrown into the
river It was quite a ceremony

My dear Mrs Graves said solemnly it was not a ceremony It was a
ritea significant rite

How can I reconcile the thoughts I had that afternoon with my later
visit to Miss Emily The little upper room in the village dominated
and almost filled by an oldfashioned bed and Miss Emily frail and
delicate and beautifully neat propped with pillows and holding a fine
handkerchief as fresh as the flutings of her small cap in her hand
On a small stand beside the bed were her Bible her spectacles and her
quaint oldfashioned gold watch

And Miss Emily herself She was altered shockingly altered A certain
tenseness had gone a tenseness that had seemed to uphold her frail body
and carry her about Only her eyes seemed greatly alive and before I
left they too had ceased their searching of mine and looked weary and
old

And at the end of my short visit I had reluctantly reached this
conclusion either Miss Emily had done the thing she confessed to doing
incredible as it might appear or she thought she had done it and the
thing was killing her

She knew I had found the confession I knew that It was written large
over her What she had expected me to do God only knows To stand up and
denounce her To summon the law I do not know

She said an extraordinary thing when at last I rose to go I believe
now that it was to give me my chance to speak Probably she found the
suspense intolerable But I could not do it I was too surprised too
perplexed toowell afraid of hurting her I had the feeling I know
that I must protect her And that feeling never left me until the end

I think you must know my dear she said from her pillows that I
have your Paisley shawl

I was breathless I thought that perhapsI stumbled

It was raining that night she said in her soft delicate voice I
have had it dried and pressed It is not hurt I thought you would not
mind she concluded

It does not matter at allnot in the least I said unhappily

I am quite sure now that she meant me to speak then I can recall the
way she fixed her eyes on me serene and expectant She was waiting But
to save my life I could not And she did not Had she gone as far as she
had the strength to go Or was this again one of those curious pacts of
hersif I spoke or was silent it was to be

I do not know

I do know that we were both silent and that at last with a quick
breath she reached out and thumped on the floor with a cane that stood
beside the bed until a girl came running up from below stairs

Get the shawl Fanny dear said Miss Emily and wrap it up for Miss
Blakiston

I wanted desperately while the girl left the room to obey to say
something helpful something reassuring But I could not My voice
failed me And Miss Emily did not give me another opportunity She
thanked me rather formally for the flowers I had brought from her
garden and let me go at last with the parcel under my arm without
further reference to it The situation was incredible

Somehow I had the feeling that Miss Emily would never reopen the subject
again She had given me my chance at who knows what cost and I had not
taken it There had been something in her goodbyI can not find words
for it but it was perhaps a finality an effect of a closed doorthat
I felt without being able to analyze

I walked back to the house refusing the offices of Mr Staley who met
me on the road I needed to think But thinking took me nowhere Only
one conclusion stood out as a result of a mile and a half of mental
struggle Something must be done Miss Emily ought to be helped She was
under a strain that was killing her

But to help I should know the facts Only were there any facts to know
Supposejust by way of argument for I did not believe itthat the
confession was true how could I find out anything about it Five years
was a long time I could not go to the neighbors They were none too
friendly as it was Besides the secret if there was one was not mine
but was Miss Emilys

I reached home at last and smuggled the shawl into the house I had no
intention of explaining its return to Maggie Yet small as it was in
its way it offered a problem at once For Maggie has a penetrating eye
and an inquiring nature I finally decided to take the bull by the horns
and hang it in its accustomed place in the hall where Maggie finding
it at nine oclock that evening set up such a series of shrieks and
exclamations as surpassed even her own record

I knitted that evening It has been my custom for years to knit
bedroomslippers for an old ladies home in which I am interested
Because I can work at them with my eyes shut through long practise
I find the work soothing So that evening I knitted at Eliza
Klinordlingers fifth annual right slipper and tried to develop a
course of action

I began with a major premiseto regard the confession as a real one
until it was proved otherwise Granted then that my little old Miss
Emily had killed a woman

1stWho was the woman

2ndWhere is the body

3rdWhat was the reason for the crime

Question two I had a tentative answer for However horrible and
incredible it seemed it was at least possible that Miss Emily had
substituted the body for the books and that what Mrs Graves described
as a rite had indeed been one But that brought up a picture I could not
face And yet

I called up the local physician a Doctor Lingard that night and asked
him about Miss Emilys condition He was quite frank with me

Its just a breaking up he said It has come early because she has
had a trying life and more responsibility than she should have had

I have been wondering if a change of scene would not be a good thing
I suggested But he was almost scornful

Change he said Ive been after her to get away for years She wont
leave I dont believe she has been twelve miles away in thirty years

I suppose her brother was a great care I observed

It seemed to me that the doctors hearty voice was a trifle less frank
when he replied But when I rang off I told myself that I too was
becoming neurasthenic and suspicious I had however learned what I had
wanted to know Miss Emily had had no life outside Bolivar County The
place to look for her story was here in the immediate vicinity

That night I made a second visit to the basement It seemed to me with
those chaotic shelves before me that something of the haste and terror
of a night five years before came back to me a night when confronted
by the necessity for concealing a crime the box upstairs had been
hurriedly unpacked its contents hidden here and locked away and some
other content inert and heavy had taken the place of the books

Miss Emily in her high bed her Bible and spectacles on the stand beside
her her starched pillows her soft and highbred voice Or another
Miss Emily panting and terrorstricken carrying down her armfuls of
forbidden books her slight figure bent under their weight her ears
open for sounds from the silent house Or that third Miss Emily Martin
Spragues a strange wild creature neither sane nor insane building a
crime out of the fabric of a nightmare Which was the real Emily Benton

Or was there another contingency that I had not thought of Had some
secret enemy of Miss Emilys some hysterical girl from the parish
suffering under a fancied slight or some dismissed and revengeful
servant taken this strange method of retaliation done it and then
warned the little old lady that her house contained such a paper I
confess that this last thought took hold on me It offered a way out
that I clutched at

I had an almost frantic feeling by that time that I must know the
truth Suspense was weighing on me And Maggie never slow to voice
an unpleasant truth said that night as she brought the carafe of
icewater to the library Youre going off the last few days Miss
Agnes And when I made no reply Youre sagging around the chin
Theres nothing shows age like the chin If youd rub a little
lemonjuice on at night youd tighten up some

I ignored her elaborately but I knew she was right Heat and sleepless
nights and those early days of fear had told on me And although I
usually disregard Maggies cosmetic suggestions culled from the beauty
columns of the evening paper a look in the mirror decided me I went
downstairs for the lemon At least I thought it was for the lemon I
am not sure I have come to be uncertain of my motives It is distinctly
possible that subconsciously I was making for the cellar all the
time I only know that I landed there with a lemon in my hand at
something after eleven oclock

The books were piled in disorder on the shelves Their five years of
burial had not hurt them beyond a slight dampness of the leaves No
hand I believe had touched them since they were taken from the box
where Mrs Graves had helped to pack them Then if I were shrewd I
should perhaps gather something from their very disorder But as a
matter of fact I did not

I would quite certainly have gone away as I came clueless had I not
attempted to straighten a pile of books dangerously sagginglike my
chinand threatening a fall My effort was rewarded by a veritable
Niagara of books They poured over the edge a few first then more
until I stood it seemed kneedeep in a raging sea of atheism

Somewhat grimly I set to work to repair the damage and one by one I
picked them up and restored them I put them in methodically this time
glancing at each title to place the volume upright Suddenly out of
the darkness of unbelief a title caught my eye and held it The
Handwriting of God I knew the book It had fallen into bad company
but its theology was unimpeachable It did not belong It

I opened it The Reverend Samuel Thaddeus had written his own name in
it in the cramped hand I had grown to know Evidently its presence
there was accidental I turned it over in my hands and saw that it was
closed down on something on several things indeed They proved to be a
small black notebook a pair of spectacles a womans handkerchief

I stood there looking at them They might mean nothing but the
accidental closing of a book which was mistakenly placed in bad
company perhaps by Mrs Graves I was inclined to doubt her knowledge
of religious literature Or they might mean something more something I
had feared to find

Armed with the volume and the lemon forgottenwhere the cook found it
the next day and made much of the mysteryI went upstairs again

Viewed in a strong light the three articles took on real significance
The spectacles I fancied were Miss Emilys They were to all
appearances the duplicates of those on her tidy bedside stand But the
handkerchief was not hers Even without the scent which had left it
but clung obstinately to the pages of the book I knew it was not hers
It was florid embroidered and cheap And held close to the light I
made out a laundrymark in ink on the border The name was either Wright
or Knight

The notebook was an old one and covered a period of almost twenty
years It contained dates and cash entries The entries were nearly all
in the Reverend Samuel Thaddeuss hand but after the date of his death
they had been continued in Miss Emilys writing They varied little
save that the amounts gradually increased toward the end and the dates
were further apart Thus in 1898 there were six entries aggregating
five hundred dollars In 19021903 there were no entries at all but
in 1904 there was a single memorandum of a thousand dollars The entire
amount must have been close to twentyfive thousand dollars There was
nothing to show whether it was money saved or money spent money paid
out or come in

But across the years 1902 and 1903 the Reverend Thaddeus had written
diagonally the word Australia There was a certain amount of
enlightenment there Carlo Benton had been in Australia during those
years In his Fifty Years in Bolivar County the father had rather
naively quoted a letter from Carlo Benton in Melbourne A record then
in all probability of sums paid by this harassed old man to a worthless
son

Only the handkerchief refused to be accounted for

I did not sleep that night More and more as I lay wideeyed through
the night it seemed to me that Miss Emily must be helped that she was
drifting miserably out of life for need of a helping hand

Once toward morning I dozed off to waken in a state of terror that I
recognized as a return of the old fear But it left me soon although I
lay awake until morning

That day I made two resolvesto send for Willie and to make a
determined effort to see the night telephoneoperator My letter to
Willie off I tried to fill the day until the hour when the night
telephoneoperator was up and about late in the afternoon

The delay was simplified by the arrival of Mrs Graves in white silk
gloves and a black cotton umbrella as a sunshade She had lost her air
of being afraid I might patronize her and explained pantingly that she
had come on an errand not to call

Im at my Christmas presents now she said and Ive fixed on a
bedroom set for Miss Emily I suppose you wont care if I go right up
and measure the dressertop will you

I took her up and her sharp eyes roved over the stairs and the upper
hall

Thats where Carlo died she said Its never been used since unless
you she had paused staring into Miss Emilys deserted bedroom
Its a good thing I came she said The eyes no use to trust to
especially for bureaus

She looked around the room There was at that moment something tender
about her She even lowered her voice and softened it It took on
almost comically the refinements of Miss Emilys own speech

Whose photograph is that she asked suddenly I dont know that I
ever saw it before But it looks familiar too

She reflected before it It was clear that she felt a sort of resentment
at not recognizing the young and smiling woman in the old walnut frame
but a moment later she was measuring the dressertop her mind set on
Christmas benevolence

However before she went out she paused near the photograph

Its queer she said Ive been in this room about a thousand times
and Ive never noticed it before I suppose you can get so accustomed to
a thing that you dont notice it

As she went out she turned to me and I gathered that not only the
measurement for a gift had brought her that afternoon

About those books she said I run on a lot when I get to talking
I suppose I shouldnt have mentioned them But Im sure youll keep the
story to yourself Ive never even told Mr Graves

Of course I shall I assured her Butdidnt the hackman see you
packing the books

No indeed We packed them the afternoon after the funeral and it was
the next day that Staley took them off He thought it was old bedding
and so on and he hinted to have it given to him So Miss Emily and I
went along to see it was done right

So I discovered that the box had sat overnight in the Benton house
There remained if I was to help Miss Emily to discover what had
occurred in those dark hours when the books were taken out and something
else substituted

The total result of my conversation that afternoon on the front porch of
the small frame house on a side street with the night telephoneoperator
was additional mystery

I was not prepared for it I had anticipated resentment and possibly
insolence But I had not expected to find fright Yet the girl was
undeniably frightened I had hardly told her the object of my visit
before I realized that she was in a state of almost panic

You can understand how I feel I said I have no desire to report the
matter of course But some one has been calling the house repeatedly at
night listening until I reply and then hanging up the receiver It is
not accidental It has happened too often

Im not supposed to give out information about calls

Butjust think a moment I went on Suppose some one is planning to
rob the house and using this method of finding out if we are there or
not

I dont remember anything about the calls you are talking about she
parried without looking at me As busy as I am

Nonsense I put in you know perfectly well what I am talking about
How do I know but that it is the intention of some one to lure me
downstairs to the telephone and then murder me

I am sure it is not that she said For almost the first time she
looked directly at me and I caught a flash of somethingnot defiance
It was indeed rather like reassurance

You see you know it is not that I felt all at once that she did know
who was calling me at night and why And moreover that she would not
tell If as I suspected it was Miss Emily this girl must be to some
extent in her confidence

Butsuppose for a moment that I think I know who is calling me I
hesitated She was a pretty girl with an amiable face and more than a
suggestion of good breeding and intelligence about her I made a quick
resolve to appeal to her My dear child I said I want so very much
if I can to help some one who is in trouble But before I can help I
must know that I can help and I must be sure it is necessary I wonder
if you know what I am talking about

Why dont you go back to the city she said suddenly Go away and
forget all about us here That would help more than anything

Butwould it I asked gently Would my going away helpher

To my absolute amazement she began to cry We had been sitting on a
cheap porch seat side by side and she turned her back to me and put
her head against the arm of the bench

Shes going to die she said shakily Shes weaker every day She is
slipping away and no one does anything

But I got nothing more from her She had understood me it was clear
and when at last she stopped crying she knew well enough that she had
betrayed her understanding But she would not talk I felt that she was
not unfriendly and that she was uncertain rather than stubborn In the
end I got up little better off than when I came

Ill give you time to think it over I said Not so much about the
telephone calls because youve really answered that But about Miss
Emily She needs help and I want to help her But you tie my hands

She had a sort of gift for silence As I grew later on to know Anne
Bullard better I realized that even more So now she sat silent and
let me talk

What I want I said is to have Miss Emily know that I am
friendlythat I am willing to do anything toto show my friendliness
Anything

You see she said with a kind of dogged patience it isnt really
up to you or to me either Its something else She hesitated Shes
very obstinate she added

When I went away I was aware that her eyes followed me anxious and
thoughtful eyes with something of Miss Emilys own wideeyed gaze

Willie came late the next evening I had indeed gone upstairs to retire
when I heard his car in the drive When I admitted him he drew me into
the library and gave me a good looking over

As I thought he said Nerves gone looks gone I told you Maggie
would put a curse on you What is it

So I told him The telephone he already knew about The confession he
read over twice and then observed characteristically that he would be
eternallyI think the word is hornswoggled

When I brought out The Handwriting of God following Mrs Gravess
story of the books he looked thoughtful And indeed by the end of the
recital he was very grave

Sprague is a lunatic he said with conviction There was a body and
it went into the river in the packingcase It is distinctly possible
that this Knightor Wrightwoman who owned the handkerchief was the
victim However thats for later on The plain truth is that there was
a murder and that Miss Emily is shielding some one else

And after all that was the only immediate result of Willies visita
new theory So that now it stood there was a crime There was no crime
Miss Emily had committed it Miss Emily had not committed it Miss Emily
had confessed it but some one else had committed it

For a few hours however our attention was distracted from Miss Emily
and her concerns by the attempted robbery of the house that night
I knew nothing of it until I heard Willie shouting downstairs I was
deeply asleep relaxed no doubt by the consciousness that at last there
was a man in the house And indeed Maggie slept for the same reason
through the entire occurrence

Stop or Ill fire Willie repeated as I sat up in bed

I knew quite well that he had no weapon There was not one in the house
But the next moment there was a loud report either a door slamming or a
pistolshot and I ran to the head of the stairs

There was no light below but a current of cool night air came up the
staircase And suddenly I realized that there was complete silence in
the house

Willie I cried out in an agony of fright But he did not reply And
then suddenly the telephone rang

I did not answer it I know now why it rang that there was real anxiety
behind its summons But I hardly heard it then I was convinced that
Willie had been shot

I must have gone noiselessly down the stairs and at the foot I ran
directly into Willie He was standing there only a deeper shadow in
the blackness and I had placed my hand over his as it lay on the
newelpost before he knew I was on the staircase He wheeled sharply
and I felt to my surprise that he held a revolver in his hand

Willie What is it I said in a low tone

Sh he whispered Dont moveor speak

We listened standing together There were undoubtedly sounds outside
some one moving about a hand on a windowcatch and finally not
particularly cautious steps at the front door It swung open I could
hear it creak as it moved slowly on its hinges

I put a hand out to steady myself by the comfort of Willies presence
before me between me and that softlyopening door But Willie was
moving forward crouched down I fancied and the memory of that
revolver terrified me

Dont shoot him Willie I almost shrieked

Shoot whom said Willies cool voice just inside the door

I knew then and I went sick all over Somewhere in the hall between us
crouched the man I had taken for Willie crouched with a revolver in
his right hand The door was still open I knew and I could hear
Willie fumbling on the hallstand for matches I called out something
incoherent about not striking a light but Willie whistling softly to
show how cool he was struck a match It was followed instantly by a
report and I closed my eyes

When I opened them Willie was standing unhurt staring over the burning
match at the door which was closed and I knew that the report had been
but the bang of the heavy door

What in blazes slammed that door he said

The burglar or whatever he is I said my voice trembling in spite
of me He was here in front of me I laid my hand on his He had a
revolver in it When you opened the door he slipped out past you

Willie muttered something and went toward the door A moment later I
was alone again and the telephone was ringing I felt my way back
along the hall I touched the cat which had been sleeping on the
telephonestand He merely turned over

I have tried in living that night over again to record things as they
impressed me For after all this is a narrative of motive rather than
of incidents of emotions as against deeds But at the time the
brief conversation over the telephone seemed to me both horrible and
unnatural

From a great distance a womans voice said Is anything wrong there

That was the first question and I felt quite sure that it was the
Bullard girls voice That is looking back from the safety of the next
day I so decided At the time I had no thought whatever

There is nothing wrong I replied I do not know why I said it Surely
there was enough wrong with Willie chasing an armed intruder through
the garden

I thought the connection had been cut for there was a buzzing on the
wire But a second or so later there came an entirely different voice
one I had never heard before a plaintive voice full I thought of
tears

Oh please said this voice go out and look in your garden or along
the road Pleasequickly

You will have to explain I said impatiently Of course we will go
and look but who is it and why

I was cut off there definitely and I could not get centrals
attention again

Willies voice from the veranda boomed through the lower floor This is
I he called No boiling water please I am coming in

He went into the library and lighted a lamp He was smiling when I
entered a reassuring smile but rather a sheepish one too

To think of letting him get by like that he said The cheapest kind
of a trick He had slammed the door before to make me think he had gone
out and all the time he was inside And youwhy didnt you scream

I thought it was you I told him

The library was in chaos Letters were lying about papers books The
drawer of the large desktable in the center of the room had been drawn
out and searched The History of Bolivar County for instance was
lying on the floor face down in a most ignoble position In one place
books had been taken from a recess by the fireplace revealing a small
wall cupboard behind I had never known of the hidingplace but a
glance into it revealed only a bottle of red ink and the manuscript of a
sermon on missions

Standing in the disorder of the room I told Willie about the
telephonemessage He listened attentively and at first skeptically

Probably a ruse to get us out of the house but coming a trifle late
to be useful was his comment But I had read distress in the second
voice and said so At last he went to the telephone

Ill verify it he explained If some one is really anxious Ill get
the car and take a scout around

But he received no satisfaction from the Bullard girl who he reported
listened stoically and then said she was sorry but she did not remember
who had called On his reminding her that she must have a record she
countered with the flat statement that there had been no call for us
that night

Willie looked thoughtful when he returned to the library Theres a
queer story back of all this he said I think Ill get the car and
scout around

He is armed Willie I protested

He doesnt want to shoot me or he could have done it was his answer
Ill just take a look around and come back to report

It was halfpast three by the time he was ready to go He was as he
observed rather sketchily clad but the night was warm I saw him off
and locked the door behind him Then I went into the library to wait and
to put things to rights while I waited

The dawn is early in August and although it was not more than halfpast
four when Willie came back it was about daylight by that time I went
to the door and watched him bring the car to a standstill He shook his
head when he saw me

Absolutely nothing he said It was a ruse to get me out of the
house of course Ive run the whole way between here and town twice

But that could not have taken an hour I protested

No he said I met the doctorwhats his namethe local MD
anyhowfooting it out of the village to a case and I took him to his
destination He has a car it seems but its out of order Interesting
old chap he added as I led the way into the house Didnt know me
from Adam but opened up when he found who I was

I had prepared the coffee machine and carried the tray to the library
While I lighted the lamp he stood whistling softly and thoughtfully
At last he said

Look here Aunt Agnes I think Im a good bit of a fool butsome time
this morning I wish you would call up Thomas Jenkins on the Elmburg
road and find out if any one is sick there

But when I stared at him he only laughed sheepishly You can see how
your suspicious disposition has undermined and ruined my once trusting
nature he scoffed

He took his coffee and then stripping off his ulster departed for
bed I stopped to put away the coffee machine and with Maggie in mind
to hang up his motorcoat It was then that the flashlight fell out I
picked it up It was shaped like a revolver

I stopped in Willies room on my way to my own and held it out to him

Where did you get that I asked

Good heavens he said raising himself on his elbow It belongs
to the doctor He gave it to me to examine the fan belt I must have
dropped it into my pocket

And still I was nowhere Suppose I had touched this flashlight at the
foot of the stairs and mistaken it for a revolver Suppose that the
doctor making his way toward the village and finding himself pursued
had faced about and pretended to be leaving it Grant in a word that
Doctor Lingard himself had been our night visitorwhat then Why had he
done it What of the telephonecall urging me to search the road Did
some one realize what was happening and take this method of warning us
and sending us after the fugitive

I knew the Thomas Jenkins farm on the Elmsburg road I had indeed
bought vegetables and eggs from Mr Jenkins himself That morning as
early as I dared I called the Jenkins farm Mr Jenkins himself would
bring me three dozen eggs that day They were a little torn up out
there as Mrs Jenkins had borne a small daughter at seven AM

When I told Willie he was evidently relieved Im glad of it he said
heartily The doctors a fine old chap and Id hate to think he was
mixed up in any shady business

He was insistent that day that I give up the house He said it was not
safe and I was inclined to agree with him But although I did not
tell him of it I had even more strongly than ever the impression that
something must be done to help Miss Emily and that I was the one who
must do it

Yet in the broad light of day with the sunshine pouring into the
rooms I was compelled to confess that Willies theory was more than
upheld by the facts First of all was the character of Miss Emily as I
read it sternly conscientious proud and yet gentle Second there was
the connection of the Bullard girl with the case And third there
was the invader of the night before an unknown quantity where so much
seemed known where a situation involving Miss Emily alone seemed to
call for no one else

Willie put the matter flatly to me as he stood in the hall drawing on
his driving gloves

Do you want to follow it up he asked Isnt it better to let it go
After all you have only rented the house You havent taken over its
history or any responsibility but the rent

I think Miss Emily needs to be helped I said rather feebly

Let her friends help her She has plenty of them Besides isnt it
rather a queer way to help her to try to fasten a murder on her

I could not explain what I felt so stronglythat Miss Emily could only
be helped by being hurt that whatever she was concealing the long
concealment was killing her That I felt in herit is always difficult
to put what I felt about Miss Emily into wordsthat she both hoped for
and dreaded desperately the light of the truth

But if I was hardly practical when it came to Miss Emily I was
rational enough in other things It is with no small pridebut without
exultation for in the end it cost too muchthat I point to the
solution of one issue as my own

With Willie gone Maggie and I settled down to the quiet tenure of our
days She informed me on the morning after that eventful night that
she had not closed an eye after one oclock She came into the library
and asked me if I could order her some sleepingpowders

Fiddlesticks I said sharply You slept all night I was up and
around the house and you never knew it

Honest to heaven Miss Agnes I never slep at all I heard a horse
galloping like it was runnin off and it waked me for good

And after a time I felt that however mistaken Maggie had been about her
nights sleep she was possibly correct about the horse

He started to run about the stable somewhere she said You can smile
if you want Thats the heavens truth And he came down the drive on
the jump and out onto the road

We can go and look for hoofmarks I said and rose But Maggie only
shook her head

It was no real horse Miss Agnes she said Youll find nothing
Anyhow Ive been and looked Theres not a mark

But Maggie was wrong I found hoofprints in plenty in the turf beside
the drive and a track of them through the lettucebed in the garden
More than that behind the stable I found where a horse had been tied
and had broken away A piece of worn strap still hung there It was
sufficiently clear then that whoever had broken into the house had
come on horseback and left afoot But many people in the neighborhood
used horses The clue if clue it can be called got me nowhere




IV


For several days things remained in statu quo Our lives went on evenly
The telephone was at our service without any of its past vagaries
Maggies eyes ceased to look as if they were being pushed out from
behind and I ceased to waken at night and listen for untoward signs

Willie telephoned daily He was frankly uneasy about my remaining there
You know something that somebody resents your knowing he said a day
or two after the night visitor It may become very uncomfortable for
you

And after a day or two I began to feel that it was being made
uncomfortable for me I am a social being I like people In the city
my neighborly instincts have died of a sort of brick wall apathy but in
the country it comes to life again The instinct of gregariousness is as
old as the first hamlets I daresay when prehistoric man ceased to live
in trees and banded together for protection from the wild beasts that
walked the earth

The village became unfriendly It was almost a matter of a night One
day the postmistress leaned on the shelf at her window and chatted with
me The next she passed out my letters with hardly a glance Mrs Graves
did not see me at early communion on Sunday morning The hackman was
busy when I called him It was intangible a matter of omission not
commission The doctors wife who had asked me to tea called up and
regretted that she must go to the city that day

I sat down then and took stock of things Did the village believe that
Miss Emily must be saved from me Did the village know the story I
was trying to learn and was it determined I should never find out the
truth And if this were so was the village right or was I They
would save Miss Emily by concealment while I felt that concealment had
failed and that only the truth would do Did the village know or only
suspect Or was it not the village at all but one or two people who
were determined to drive me away

My theories were rudely disturbed shortly after that by a visit from
Martin Sprague I fancied that Willie had sent him but he evaded my
question

Id like another look at that slip of paper he said Where do you
keep it by the way

In a safe place I replied noncommittally and he laughed The truth
was that I had taken out the removable inner sole of a slipper and had
placed it underneath an excellent hidingplace but one I did not care
to confide to him When I had brought it downstairs he read it over
again carefully and then sat back with it in his hand

Now tell me about everything he said

I did while he listened attentively Afterward we walked back to the
barn and I showed him the piece of broken halter still tied there

He surveyed it without comment but on the way back to the house he
said If the village is lined up as you say it is I suppose it is
useless to interview the harnessmaker He has probably repaired that
strap or sold a new one to whoeverIt would be a nice clue to follow
up

I am not doing detective work I said shortly I am trying to help
some one who is dying of anxiety and terror

He nodded I get you he said But his tone was not flippant The
fact is of course that the early theory wont hold There has been a
crime and the little old lady did not commit it But suppose you find
out who did it How is that going to help her

I dont know Martin I said in a sort of desperation But I have
the most curious feeling that she is depending on me The way she spoke
the day I saw her and her eyes and everything I know you think it
nonsense I finished lamely

I think youd better give up the place and go back to town he said
But I saw that he watched me carefully and when at last he got up to
go he put a hand on my shoulder

I think you are right after all he said There are a good many
things that cant be reasoned out with any logic we have but that are
true nevertheless We call it intuition but its really subconscious
intelligence Stay by all means if you feel you should

In the doorway he said Remember this Miss Agnes Both a crime of
violence and a confession like the one in your hand are the products of
impulse They are not either of them premeditated They are not
the work then of a calculating or cautious nature Look for a big
emotional type

It was a day or two after that that I made my visit to Miss Emily I had
stopped once before to be told with an air of finality that the invalid
was asleep On this occasion I took with me a basket of fruit I had
half expected a refusal but I was admitted

The Bullard girl was with Miss Emily She had I think been kneeling
beside the bed and her eyes were red and swollen But Miss Emily
herself was as cool as dainty and starched and fragile as ever More
so I thought She was thinner and although it was a warm August day
a white silk shawl was wrapped around her shoulders and fastened with an
amethyst brooch In my clasp her thin hand felt hot and dry

I have been waiting for you she said simply She looked at Anne
Bullard and the message in her eyes was plain enough But the girl
ignored it She stood across the bed from me and eyed me steadily

My dear said Miss Emily in her highbred voice if you have
anything to do Miss Blakiston will sit with me for a little while

I have nothing to do said the girl doggedly Perhaps this is not the
word She had more the look of endurance and supreme patience There was
no sharpness about her although there was vigilance

Miss Emily sighed and I saw her eyes seek the Bible beside her But she
only said gently Then sit down dear You can work at my knitting if
you like My hands get very tired

She asked me questions about the house and the garden The raspberries
were usually quite good and she was rather celebrated for her lettuces
If I had more than I needed would I mind if Mr Staley took a few in to
the doctor who was fond of them

The mention of Doctor Lingard took me back to the night of the burglary
I wondered if to tell Miss Emily would unduly agitate her I think I
would not have told her but I caught the girls eye across the bed
raised from her knitting and fixed on me with a peculiar intensity
Suddenly it seemed to me that Miss Emily was surrounded by a conspiracy
of silence and it roused my antagonism

There are plenty of lettuces I said although a few were trampled by
a runaway horse the other night It is rather a curious story

So I told her of our night visitor I told it humorously lightly
touching on my own horror at finding I had been standing with my hand on
the burglars shoulder But I was sorry for my impulse immediately for
I saw Miss Emilys body grow rigid and her hands twist together She
did not look at me She stared fixedly at the girl Their eyes met

It was as if Miss Emily asked a question which the girl refused to
answer It was as certain as though it had been a matter of words
instead of glances It was over in a moment Miss Bullard went back to
her knitting but Miss Emily lay still

I think I should not have told you I apologized I thought it
might interest you Of course nothing whatever was taken and no damage
doneexcept to the lettuces

Anne said Miss Emily will you bring me some fresh water

The girl rose reluctantly but she did not go farther than the top of
the staircase just beyond the door We heard her calling to some one
below in her clear young voice to bring the water and the next moment
she was back in the room But Miss Emily had had the opportunity for one
sentence

I know now she said quietly that you have found it

Anne Bullard was watching from the doorway and it seemed to me having
got so far I could not retreat I must go on

Miss Bullard I said I would like to have just a short conversation
with Miss Emily It is about a private matter I am sure you will not
mind if I ask you

I shall not go out

Anne said Miss Emily sharply

The girl was dogged enough by that time Both dogged and frightened I
felt But she stood her ground

She is not to be worried about anything she insisted And shes not
supposed to have visitors Thats the doctors orders

I felt outraged and indignant but against the stone wall of the girls
presence and her distrust I was helpless I got up with as much dignity
as I could muster

I should have been told that downstairs

The womans a fool said Anne Bullard with a sort of suppressed
fierceness She stood aside as having said goodby to Miss Emily I
went out and I felt that she hardly breathed until I had got safely to
the street

Looking back I feel that Emily Benton died at the hands of her friends
For she died indeed died in the act of trying to tell me what they had
determined she should never tell Died of kindness and misunderstanding
Died repressed as she had lived repressed Yet I think died calmly
and bravely

I had made no further attempt to see her and Maggie and I had taken
up again the quiet course of our lives The telephone did not ring of
nights The cat came and went spending as I had learned its days with
Miss Emily and its nights with us I have wondered since how many nights
Miss Emily had spent in the low chair in that back hall where the
confession lay hidden that the cat should feel it could sleep nowhere
else

The days went by warm days and cooler ones but rarely rainy ones
The dust from the road settled thick over flowers and shrubbery The
lettuces wilted and those that stood up in the sun were strong and
bitter By the end of August we were gasping in a hot dryness that
cracked the skin and made any but cold food impossible

Miss Emily lay through it all in her hot upper room in the village and
my attempt through Doctor Lingard to coax her back to the house by
offering to leave it brought only a negative It would be better for
her you understand the doctor said over the telephone But she is
very determined and she insists on remaining where she is

And I believe this was the truth They would surely have been glad to
get rid of me these friends of Miss Emilys

I have wondered since what they thought of me Anne Bullard and the
doctor to have feared me as they did I look in the mirror and I see
a middleaged woman with a determined nose slightly inquisitive and
what I trust is a humorous mouth for it has no other virtues But they
feared me Perhaps long looking for a danger affects the mental vision
Anyhow by the doctors order I was not allowed to call and see Miss
Emily again

Then one night the heat suddenly lifted One moment I was sitting on
the veranda lifeless and inert and the next a cool wind with a hint
of rain had set the shutters to banging and the curtains to flowing
like flags of truce from the windows The air was life energy I felt
revivified

And something of the same sort must have happened to Miss Emily She
must have sat up among her pillows her face fanned with the electric
breeze and made her determination to see me Anne Bullard was at work
and she was free from observation

It must have been nine oclock when she left the house a shaken little
figure in black not as neat as usual but hooked and buttoned for all
that with no one will ever know what agony of old hands

She was two hours and a half getting to the house and the rain came
at ten oclock By half after eleven when the doorbell rang she was
a sodden mass of wet garments and her teeth were chattering when I led
her into the library

She could not talk The thing she had come to say was totally beyond
her I put her to bed in her own room And two days later she died

I had made no protest when Anne Bullard presented herself at the door
the morning after Miss Emily arrived and walking into the house took
sleepless charge of the sickroom And I made no reference save once to
the reason for the tragedy That was the night Miss Emily died Anne
Bullard had called to me that she feared there was a change and I went
into the sickroom There was a change and I could only shake my head
She burst out at me then

If only you had never taken this house she said You people with
money you think there is nothing you can not have You came and now
look

Anne I said with a bitterness I could not conceal Miss Emily is not
young and I think she is ready to go But she has been killed by her
friends I wanted to help but they would not allow me to

Toward morning there was nothing more to be done and we sat together
listening to the stertorous breathing from the bed Maggie who had
been up all night had given me notice at three in the morning and was
upstairs packing her trunk

I went into my room and brought back Miss Emilys confession

Isnt it time I said to tell me about this I ought to know I
think before she goes If it is not true you owe it to her I think
But she shook her head

I looked at the confession and from it to Miss Emilys pinched old
face

To whom it may concern On the 30th day of May 1911 I killed a woman
here in this house I hope you will not find this until I am dead

Signed EMILY BENTON

Anne was watching me I went to the mantel and got a match and then
standing near the bed I lighted it and touched it to the paper It
burned slowly a thin blue semicircle of fire that ate its way slowly
across until there was but the corner I held I dropped it into the
fireplace and watched it turn to black ash

I may have fancied itI am always fancying things about Miss Emilybut
I will always think that she knew She drew a longer quieter breath
and her eyes fixed and staring closed I think she died in the first
sleep she had had in twentyfour hours

I had expected Anne Bullard to show emotion for no one could doubt her
attachment to Miss Emily But she only stood stoically by the bed for
a moment and then turning swiftly went to the wall opposite and
took down from the wall the walnutframed photograph Mrs Graves had
commented on

Anne Bullard stood with the picture in her hand looking at it And
suddenly she broke into sobs It was stormy weeping and I got the
impression that she wept not for Miss Emily but for many other
thingsas though the piledup grief of years had broken out at last

She took the photograph away and I never saw it again

Miss Emily was buried from her home I obliterated myself and her
friends who were I felt her murderers came in and took charge They
paid me the tribute of much politeness but no cordiality and I think
they felt toward me as I felt toward them They blamed me with the whole
affair

She left her property all to Anne Bullard to the astonished rage of the
congregation which had expected the return of its dimes and quarters
no doubt in the shape of a new altar or perhaps an organ

Not a cent to keep up the mausoleum or anything Mrs Graves confided
to me And nothing to the church All to that telephonegirl who comes
from no one knows where Its enough to make her father turn over in his
grave It has set people talking I can tell you

Maggies mental state during the days preceding the funeral was curious
She coupled the most meticulous care as to the preparations for the
ceremony and a sort of loving gentleness when she decked Miss Emilys
small old frame for its last rites with suspicion and hatred of Miss
Emily living And this suspicion she held also against Anne Bullard

Yet she did not want to leave the house I do not know just what she
expected to find We were cleaning up preparatory to going back to the
city and I felt that at least a part of Maggies enthusiasm for corners
was due to a hope of locating more concealed papers She was rather
less than polite to the Bullard girl who was staying on at my
invitationbecause the village was now flagrantly unfriendly and
suspicious of her And for some strange reason the fact that Miss
Emilys cat followed Anne everywhere convinced Maggie that her
suspicions were justified

Its like this Miss Agnes she said one morning leaning on the
handle of a floor brush She had some power over the old lady and
thats how she got the property And I am saying nothing but shes
no Christian that girl To see her and that cat going out night after
night both snooping along on their tiptoesit aint normal

I had several visits from Martin Sprague since Miss Emilys death and
after a time I realized that he was interested in Anne She was quite
attractive in her mourning clothes and there was something about her
not in feature but in neatness and in the way her things had of well
staying in place that reminded me of Miss Emily herself It was rather
surprising too to see the way she fitted into her new surroundings and
circumstances

But I did not approve of Martins attraction to her She had volunteered
no information about herself she apparently had no people She was
a lady I felt although with the exception of her new mourning her
clothing was shabby and her linen even coarse

She held the key to the confession I knew that And I had no more hope
of getting it from her than I had from the cat So I prepared to go back
to the city with the mystery unsolved It seemed a pity when I had got
so far with it I had reconstructed a situation out of such bricks as
I had the books in the cellar Mrs Gravess story of the river the
confession possibly the notebook and the handkerchief I had even some
material left over in the form of the night intruder who may or may not
have been the doctor And then having got so far I had had to stop for
lack of other bricks

A day or two before I went back to the city Maggie came to me with a
folded handkerchief in her hand

Is that yours she asked

I disclaimed it It was not very fine and looked rather yellow

Sgot a name on it Maggie volunteered Wright I think it is
Taint hers unless shes picked it up somewhere Its just come out of
the wash

Maggies eyes were snapping with suspicion There aint any Wrights
around here Miss Agnes she said I shd say shes here under a false
name Wrights likely hers

In tracing the mystery of the confession I find that three apparently
disconnected discoveries paved the way to its solution Of these the
handkerchief came first

I was inclined to think that in some manner the handkerchief I had found
in the book in the cellar had got into the wash But it was where I had
placed it for safety in the wallcloset in the library I brought it
out and compared the two They were unlike save in the one regard The
name Wright was clear enough on the one Maggie had found With it as a
guide the other name was easily seen to be the same Moreover both had
been marked by the same hand

Yet on Anne Bullard being shown the one Maggie had found she
disclaimed it Dont you think some one dropped it at the funeral she
asked

But I thought as I turned away that she took a step toward me When I
stopped however and faced about she was intent on something outside
the window

And so it went I got nowhere And now by way of complication I felt
my sympathy for Annes loneliness turning to genuine interest She was
so stoical so repressed and so lonely And she was tremendously
proud Her pride was vaguely reminiscent of Miss Emilys She bore her
ostracism almost fiercely yet there were times when I felt her eyes on
me singularly gentle and appealing Yet she volunteered nothing about
herself

I intended to finish the history of Bolivar County before I left I
dislike not finishing a book Besides this one fascinated methe smug
complacence and almost loud virtue of the author his satisfaction in
Bolivar County and his small hits at the world outside his patronage
to those not of it And always when I began to read I turned to the
inscription in Miss Emilys hand the hand of the confessionand I
wondered if she had really believed it all

So on this day I found the name Bullard in the book It had belonged
to the Reverend Samuel Thaddeuss grandmother and he distinctly stated
that she was the last of her line He inferred indeed that since
the line was to end it had chosen a fitting finish in his immediate
progenitor

That night at dinner I said Anne are there any Bullards in this
neighborhood now

I have never heard of any But I have not been here long

It is not a common name I persisted

But she received my statement in silence She had as I have said
rather a gift for silence

That afternoon I was wandering about the garden snipping faded roses
with Miss Emilys garden shears when I saw Maggie coming swiftly
toward me When she caught my eye she beckoned to me Walk quiet
Miss Agnes she said and dont say I didnt warn you Shes in the
library

So feeling hatefully like a spy I went quietly over the lawn toward
the library windows They were long ones to the floor and at first I
made out nothing Then I saw Anne She was on her knees following the
border of the carpet with fingers that examined it inch by inch

She turned as if she felt our eyes on her and saw us I shall never
forget her face She looked stricken I turned away There was something
in her eyes that made me think of Miss Emily lying among her pillows
and waiting for me to say the thing she was dreading to hear

I sent Maggie away with a gesture There was something in her pursed
lips that threatened danger For I felt then as if I had always known
it and only just realized I knew it that somewhere in that room lay the
answer to all questions lay Miss Emilys secret And I did not wish to
learn it It was better to go on wondering to question and doubt and
decide and decide again I was I think in a state of nervous terror by
that time terror and apprehension

While Miss Emily lived I had hoped to help But now it seemed too
hatefully like accusing when she could not defend herself And there is
another element that I am bound to acknowledge There was an element of
jealousy of Anne Bullard Both of us had tried to help Miss Emily She
had foiled my attempt in her own endeavor a mistaken endeavor I felt
But there was now to be no blemish on my efforts I would no longer pry
or question or watch It was too late

In a curious fashion each of us wished I think to prove the quality
of her tenderness for the little old lady who was gone beyond all human
tenderness

So that evening after dinner I faced Anne in the library

Why not let things be as they are Anne I asked It can do no good
Whatever it is and I do not know why not let things rest

Some one may find it she replied Some one who does not care as
Ias we care

Are you sure there is something

She told me near the last I only dont know just where it is

And if you find it

It is a letter I shall burn it without reading Although she drew a
long breath I know what it contains

If in any way it comes into my hands I assured her I shall let you
know And I shall not read it

She looked thoughtful rather than grateful

I hardly know she said I think she would want you to read it if
it came to you It explains so much And it was a part of her plan You
know of course that she had a plan It was a sort of arrangementshe
hesitatedit was a sort of pact she made with God if you know what I
mean

That night Maggie found the letter

I had gone upstairs and Anne was I think already asleep I heard what
sounded like distant hammering and I went to the door Some one was
in the library below The light was shining out into the hall and
my discovery of that was followed almost immediately by the faint
splintering of wood Rather outraged than alarmed I went back for
my dressinggown and as I left the room I confronted Maggie in the
hallway She had an envelope in one hand and a hatchet in the other

I found it she said briefly

She held it out and I took it On the outside in Miss Emilys writing
it said To whom it may concern It was sealed

I turned it over in my hand while Maggie talked

When I saw that girl crawling around she said seems to me I
remembered all at once seeing Miss Emily that day I found her running
her finger along the baseboard Says I to myself theres something
more hidden and she dont know where it is But I do So I lifted the
baseboard and this was behind it

Anne heard her from her room and she went out soon afterward I heard
her going down the stairs and called to her But she did not answer I
closed the door on Maggie and stood in my room staring at the envelope

I have wondered since whether Miss Emily had she lived would have put
the responsibility on Providence for the discovery of her pitiful story
So many of us blame the remorseless hand of destiny for what is so
manifestly our own doing It was her own anxiety surely that led to
the discovery in each instance yet I am certain that old Emily Benton
died convinced that a higher hand than any on earth had directed the
discovery of the confession

Miss Emily has been dead for more than a year now To publish the letter
can do her no harm In a way too I feel it may be the fulfilment of
that strange pact she made For just as discovery was the thing she most
dreaded so she felt that by paying her penalty here she would be saved
something beyondthat sort of spiritual bookkeeping which most of us
call religion Anne Spragueshe is married now to Martin has I think
some of Miss Emilys feeling about it although she denies it But I
am sure that in consenting to the recording of Miss Emilys story she
feels that she is doing what that gentle fatalist would call following
the hand of Providence

I read the letter that night in the library where the light was good It
was a narrative not a letter strictly speaking It began abruptly

I must set down this thing as it happened I shall write it fully
because I must get it off my mind I find that I am always composing
it and that my lips move when I walk along the street or even when I am
sitting in church How terrible if I should some day speak it aloud My
greatgrandmother was a Catholic She was a Bullard Perhaps it is from
her that I have this overwhelming impulse to confession And lately I
have been terrified I must tell it or I shall shriek it out some day
in the church during the Litany From battle and murder and from
sudden death Good Lord deliver us

There was a space here When the writing began again time had elapsed
The ink was different the writing more controlled

What a terrible thing hate is It is a poison It penetrates the mind
and the body and changes everything I who once thought I could hate no
one now find that hate is my daily life my getting up and lying down
my sleep my waking

From hatred envy and malice and all uncharitableness Good Lord
deliver us

Must one suffer twice for the same thing Is it not true that we pay
but one penalty Surely we pay either here or beyond but not both Oh
not both

Will this ever be found Where shall I hide it For I have the feeling
that I must hide it not destroy itas the Catholic buries his sin with
the priest My father once said that it is the healthful humiliation of
the confessional that is its reason for existing If humiliation be a
virtue

I have copied the confession to this point but I find I can not go on
She was so merciless to herself so hideously calm so exact as to dates
and hours She had laid her life on the table and dissected itfor the
Almighty

I heard the story that night gently told and somehow I feel that that
is the version by which Miss Emily will be judged

If humiliation be a virtue I read and was about to turn the page
when I heard Anne in the hall She was not alone I recognized Doctor
Lingards voice

Five minutes later I was sitting opposite him almost knee to knee
and he was telling me how Miss Emily had come to commit her crime Anne
Bullard was there standing on the hearth rug She kept her eyes on
me and after a time I realized that these two simple people feared
me feared for Miss Emilys gentle memory feared that Igood
heavenwould make the thing public

First of all Miss Blakiston said the doctor one must have known
the family to realize the situationits pride in its own uprightness
The virtue of the name what it stood for in Bolivar County She was
raised on that A Benton could do no wrong because a Benton would do no
wrong

But there is another side also I doubt if any girl was ever raised
as Miss Emily was Shewell she knew nothing At fifty she was as
childlike and innocent as she was at ten She had practically never
heard of vice The ugly things for her did not exist

And all the time there was a deep and strong nature underneath She
should have married and had children but there was no one here for
her to marry I he smiled faintly I asked for her myself and was
forbidden the house for years as a result

You have heard of the brother But of course you have I know you have
found the books Such an existence as the family life here was bound to
have its reactions Carlo was a reaction Twentyfive years ago he ran
away with a girl from the village He did not marry her I believe he
was willing at one time but his father opposed it violently It would
have been to recognize a thing he refused to recognize He turned
suddenly to Anne Dont you think this is going to be painful he
asked

Why I know it all

Very well This girlthe one Carlo ran away withdetermined to make
the family pay for that refusal She made them actually pay year by
year Emily knew about it She had to pinch to make the payments The
father sat in a sort of detached position in the center of Bolivar
County and let her bear the brunt of it I shall never forget the day
she learned there was a child Itwell it sickened her She had not
known about those things And I imagine if we could know that that was
the beginning of things

And all the time there was the necessity for secrecy She had never
known deceit and now she was obliged to practice it constantly She had
no one to talk to Her father beyond making entries of the amounts paid
to the woman in the case had nothing to do with it She bore it all
year after year And it ate like a cancer

Remember I never knew I who would have done anything for hershe
never told me Carlo lived hard and came back to die The father went
She nursed them both I came every day and I never suspected Only
now and then I wondered about her She looked burned I dont know any
other word

Then the night after Carlo had been buried she telephoned for me
It was eleven oclock She met me out there in the hall and she said
John I have killed somebody

I thought she was out of her mind But she opened the door and

He turned and glanced at Anne

Please she said

It was Annes mother You have guessed it about Anne by now of course
It seems that the funeral had taken the money for the payment that was
due and there had been a threat of exposure And Emily had reached the
breakingpoint I believe what she saidthat she had no intention
even of striking her You cant take the act itself You have to take
twentyfive years into account Anyhow she picked up a chair and
knocked the woman down And it killed her He ran his fingers through
his heavy hair It should not have killed her he reflected There
must have been some other weakness heart or something I dont know
But it was a heavy chair I dont see how Emily

His voice trailed off

There we were he said with a long breath Poor Emily and the other
poor soul neither of them fundamentally at fault both victims

I know about the books I put in hastily I could not have him going
over that again

You knew that too He gazed at me

Poor Emily he said She tried to atone She brought Anne here and
told her the whole story It was a bad timeall round But at last Anne
saw the light The only one who would not see the light was Emily And
at last she hit on this confession idea I suspected it when she rented
the house When I accused her of it she said I have given it to
Providence to decide If the confession is found I shall know I am to
suffer And I shall not lift a hand to save myself

So it went through the hours Her fear which I still think was the
terror that communicated itself to me the various clues which she
poor victim had overlooked the articles laid carelessly in the
book she had been reading and accidentally hidden with her brothers
forbidden literature the books themselves with all of five years to
destroy them and left untouched her own anxiety about the confession
in the telephonebox which led to our finding it her espionage of the
house by means of the telephone the doctors night visit in search of
the confession the daily penance for five years of the dead womans
photograph in her roomall of theseand her occasional weakenings
poor soul when she tried to change her handwriting against discovery
and refused to allow the second telephone to be installed

How clear it was How in a way inevitable And too how really
best for her it had turned out For she had made a pact and she died
believing that discovery here had come and would take the place of
punishment beyond

Martin Sprague came the next day I was in the library alone and he was
with Anne in the garden when Maggie came into the room with a saucer of
crabapple jelly

I wish youd look at this she said If its cooked too much it gets
tough and She straightened suddenly and stood staring out through a
window

Id thank you to look out and see the goingson in our garden she
said sharply In broad daylight too I

But I did not hear what else Maggie had to say I glanced out and
Martin had raised the girls face to his and was kissing her gently and
very tenderly

And thenand again as with fear it is hard to put into wordsI felt
come over me such a wave of contentment and happiness as made me close
my eyes with the sheer relief and joy of it All was well The past was
past and out of its mistakes had come a beautiful thing And like the
fear this joy was not mine It came to me I picked it upa thought
without words

Sometimes I think about it and I wonderdid little Miss Emily know
