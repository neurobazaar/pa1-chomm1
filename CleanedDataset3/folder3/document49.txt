Today Ill travel to Minnesota Texas California Cleveland New Zealand
Sweden and England Im not frantically packing and I wont pick up
any frequent flyer mileage In fact Im sipping cocoa at my Macintosh
My trips will be electronic using the computer on my desk communications
software a modem and a standard phone line

Ill be using the Internet the global network of computers and their
interconnections which lets me skip like a stone across oceans and
continents and control computers at remote sites I havent visited
Antarctica yet but it is only a matter of time before a host computer
becomes available there

This short nontechnical article is an introduction to Internet
communications and how librarians and libraries can benefit from net
connectivity Following will be descriptions of electronic mail
discussion lists electronic journals and texts and resources available
to those willing to explore Historical details about the building of the
Internet and technical details regarding network speed and bandwidth are
outside the scope of this piece


Whats Out There Anyway

Until you use a radio receiver you are unaware of the wealth of
programming music and information otherwise invisible to you
Computer networks are much the same About one million people
worldwide use the Internet daily Information packet traffic
rises by 12 each month

About 727000 host computers are connected according to a January 1992
report Network Working Group Request for Comments 1296 by Mark K Lottor
So whats all the excitement about Whats zipping around in that fiber
and cable and ether anyway

On my electronic adventure I browsed the online catalog at the University
Library in Liverpool England leaving some Hi there from Liverpool New
York mail for the librarian

I downloaded some new Macintosh antivirus software from Stanfords
SUMEX archive

Then I checked a few databases for information needed for this article and
scanned todays news stories

I looked at the weather forecast for here in the East and for the San
Francisco Bay area forwarding that information to a friend in San Jose
who would read it when he woke up The Internet never closes

After that I read some electronic mail from other librarians in
Israel Korea England Australia and all over the US Were
exchanging information about how to keep viruses off public computers
how to network CDROMS and how to reink inkjet printer cartridges
among other things

I monitor about twelve discussion groups Mail sent to the group
address is distributed to all other subscribers Its similar to
a roundrobin discussion These are known variously as mailing lists
discussion groups reflectors aliases or listservs depending on what
type they are and how they are driven Subscriptions are free

One of these groups allows children and young adults all over the world to
communicate with each other Kids from Cupertino to Moscow are talking
about their lives pets families hope and dreams Its interesting to see
that Nintendo is a universal language

Teachers exchange lesson plans and bibliographies in another group and
schools participate in projects like the global market basket survey
For this project students researched what foods a typical family of four
would buy and prepare over one weeks time Their results were posted to
the global project area where they could be compared with reports from kids
all over North and South America India Scandinavia and Asia It opened
up discussions of dietary laws staple foods and cultural differences

Other lists explore the worlds of library administration reference
mystery readers romance readers birdwatcher hotlines cat enthusiasts
exSoviet Union watchers packet radio techies and thousands more
There is even a list to announce the creation of new lists


The Power of the Net

A net connection in a school is like having multiple foreign
exchange students in the classroom all the time It promotes
active participatory learning Participating in a discussion
group is like being at an ongoing library conference All the
experts are Out There waiting to be asked

Want to buy a CDROM drive Send one query and ask the 3000 folks
on PACSL Public Access Computer Systems list for advice In a few
hours youll have personal testimonies on the pros and cons of various
hardware configurations

Want to see if any libraries are doing anything with Total Quality Management
Ask the members of LIBADMIN and youll have offers of reports studies
personal experiences and more How do you cope with budget cuts personnel
layoffs or materials Again LIBADMIN use allows shared advice

Here is one story about the power of the net At Christmas an electronic
plea came from Ireland My daughter believes in Santa Claus it began
And although the My Little Pony Megan  Sundance set has not been
made in three years she believes Santa will prevail and she will find one
under her tree Mom a university professor had called the manufacturer
in the US but none were available Check around they said maybe
some yet stand on store shelves So Mom sent the call out to the net

Many readers began a global search for the wily Pony as part of their own
holiday shopping forays

Soon another message came from Dublin It seemed that a reader of the
original message had a father who was a highranking executive in the toy
company and he had managed to acquire said pony where others had failed

It was duly shipped in time to save Santas reputation

Part of the librarys mission is to help remove barriers to accessing
information and part of this is removing barriers between people
One of the most interesting things about telecommunications is that
it is the Great Equalizer It lets all kinds of computers and humans
talk to each other The old barriers of sexism ageism and racism
are not present since you cant see the person to whom youre speaking
You get to know the person without preconceived notions about what you
THINK he is going to say based on visual prejudices you may have
no matter how innocent

Well almost without visual prejudice Electronic mail is not always an
harmonic convergence of like souls adrift in the cyberspace cosmos there
are arguments and tirades called flames Sometimes you get so used to
seeing a frequent posters electronic signature that you know what hes
going to say before he says it


Smileys

One problem with written communication is that remarks meant to be humorous
are often lost Without the visual bodylanguage clues some messages may
be misinterpreted So a visual shorthand known as smileys has been
developed There are a hundred or more variations on this theme

Thats a little smiley face Look at it sideways More Smiley info may
be found via anonymous ftp at many places including the following
ftp nicfunetfi
cd pubmiscfunniessmileytxt

FTP is introduced later in the text

What a range of emotions you can show using only keyboard characters
Besides the smiley face above you can have  if youre sad or 
if youre REALLY upset  is one way of showing a wink Folks wearing
glasses might look like this online 

But for the most part the electronic community is willing to help others
Telecommunications helps us overcome what has been called the tyranny
of distance We DO have a global village

Electronic Newsletters and Serials

Subscribing to lists with reckless abandon can clog your mailbox and
provide a convenient black hole to vacuum up all your spare time You
may be more interested in free subscriptions to compiled documents known
as electronic journals These journals are automatically delivered to your
electronic door

There are a growing number of these Some of the best for librarians are
listed below To subscribe to these journals you must know how to send an
interactive message to another computer This information is well
documented in the resources listed at the end of this article Telnet and
ftp
are introduced further along in this article

Remote Login to Internet Resources TELNET

One step beyond electronic mail is the ability to control a remote computer
using TELNET This feature lets you virtually teleport anywhere on the
network and use resources located physically at that host Further some
hosts have gateways to other hosts which have further gateways to still
more hosts How can you be in two places at once It sounds more
confusing than it is What resources are available Here is a sampling of
some of the fare awaiting you at several sites

Cleveland Freenet

Freenets are the progeny of

Freenets are built around a city metaphor complete with schools
hospitals libraries courthouses and other public services


Academy One recently held an online global simulation of a series of major
space achievements 16 schools from five states and four nations
participated Here are several of the descriptions of their projects

posting hourly weather reports about the conditions in Florida
around Cape Kennedy This information is vital to the recovery
of the Friendship 7 capsule and crew Students have taken an
interest in Space Junk and will be posting additional reports
on the various probes which were used to test the surface of
the moon and how all of that junk is now becoming a hazard to
current and future space exploration

Another Freenet resource is Project Hermes This service provides
copies of Supreme Court opinions in electronic form to as wide an
audience as possible almost as soon as they are announced

The Courts opinions can be sent directly to you or you may download the
files directly from any NPTN community computer system

The Freenets also provide weather news and gateways to other resources

MICROMUSE

This is how Barry Kort aka Moulton Visiting Scientist at Educational
Technology Research BBN Labs Cambridge MA describes MicroMuse at MIT

MUDs MultiUser Dimensions or MUSEs MultiUser Simulation
Environments are virtual realities which offer a rich environment for
synergy community collaboration and exploratory discovery

Players connect to the host computer adopt a character and personality of
their choosing and enter into the synthetic world consisting of a web of
connected rooms and movable props

Everything rooms movable objects connecting passageways and
players has a description typically a few lines of text which
are displayed when a player looks at it

Actions such as picking up or dropping an object and exiting to an
adjacent room also generate a short message appropriate to the action

At MITs AI Lab MicroMuse features explorations adventures and
puzzles with redeeming social cultural and educational content
The MicroMuse Science Center offers an Exploratorium and Mathematica
Exhibit complete with interactive exhibits drawn from experience with
Science Museums around the country The Mission to Mars includes an
elaborate tour of the red planet with accurate descriptions rivaling
those found in National Geographic

Elsewhere on MicroMuse one can find an outstanding adventure based on the
childrens classic Narnia a recreation of the Wizard of Oz adventure built
by a gifted 8year old a challenging Logic Quest and a living model of the
science fiction genre The DragonRiders of Pern by author Anne McCaffrey

If you would like to explore MicroMuse you may connect as follows from

Remote Access to Files FTP

FTP or File Transfer Protocol is what to use to retrieve a text file
software or other item from a remote host Normal practice is to ftp
to the host you want and login as anonymous Some sites use the
password guest while others require that you put in your network
address as the password Some popular ftp sites follow


SUMEXAIM

Travel Agents
Archie Gopher Veronica WAIS Worldwide Web and More

There is so much information on the net its impossible to know
where everything is or even how to begin looking Fortunately
some computerized agents are in development to help sort through
the massive data libraries on the net


Archie

Peter Deutsch of McGills Computing Centre describes the archie server
concept which allows users to ask a question once yet search many
different hosts for files of interest

The archie service is a collection of resource discovery tools that together
provide an electronic directory service for locating information in an
Internet environment Originally created to track the contents of
anonymous ftp archive sites the archie service is now being expanded to
include a variety of other online directories and resource listings

Currently archie tracks the contents of over 800 anonymous FTP archive
sites containing some 1000000 files throughout the Internet Collectively
these files represent well over 50 Gigabytes 50000000000 bytes of
information with additional information being added daily Anonymous ftp
archive sites offer software data and other information which can be
copied and used without charge by anyone with connection to the Internet

The archie server automatically updates the listing information from each
site about once a month ensuring users that the information they receive
is reasonably timely without imposing an undue load on the archive sites
or network bandwidth

Unfortunately the archie server at McGill is currently out of service
Other sites are
archieansnet USA NY
archierutgersedu USA NJ
archiesuranet USA MD
archiefunetfi FinlandMainland Europe
archieau AustraliaNew Zealand
archiedocicacuk Great BritainIreland

Internet Gopher
Gopher or gofer someone who fetches necessary items from many locations

Login as gopher after you telnet to consultantmicroumnedu and enjoy
having a computer do all the work for you Almost Gopher is still in
experimental mode at many gopherized sites Still it is one of the best
ways to locate information on and in the Internet

Besides archie the gopher at consultantmicroumnedu includes fun and
games humor libraries including reference books such as the Hackers
Dictionary Rogets 1911 Thesaurus and the CIA World Fact Book gateways
to other US and foreign gophers news and gateways to other systems

VERONICA Very Easy RodentOriented Netwide Index to Computerized Archives

Very new on the scene is VERONICA
Here is some information from Steve Foster about it

Veronica offers a keyword search of most gopherserver menus in the entire
gopher web As Archie is to ftp archives Veronica is to gopherspace
Unlike Archie the search results can connect you directly to the data source
Imagine an Archie search that lets you select the data not just the host
sites directly from a menu Because Veronica is accessed through a gopher
client it is easy to use and gives access to all types of data supported
by the gopher protocol

Veronica was designed as a response to the problem of resource discovery
in the rapidlyexpanding gopher web Frustrated comments in the net news
groups have recently reflected the need for such a service Additional
motivation came from the comments of naive gopher users several of
whom assumed that a simpletouse service would provide a means to find
resources without having to know where they are

The result of a Veronica search is an automaticallygenerated gopher
menu customized according to the users keyword specification Items on
this menu may be drawn from many gopher servers These are functional
gopher items immediately accessible via the gopher client just double
click to open directories read files or perform other searches  across
hundreds of gopher servers You need never know which server is actually
involved in filling your request for information Items that are appear
particularly interesting can be saved in the users bookmark list

Notice that these are NOT fulltext searches of data at gopherserver sites
just as Archie does not index the contents of ftp sites but only the names of
files at those sites Veronica indexes the TITLES on all levels of the
menus for most gopher sites in the Internet 258 gophers are indexed by
Veronica on Nov 17 1992 we have discovered over 500 servers and will
index the full set in the near future We hope that Veronica will encourage
gopher administrators to use very descriptive titles on their menus

To try Veronica select it from the Other Gophers menu on Minnesotas
gopher server consultantmicroumnedu or point your gopher at

Veronica is an experimental service developed by Steve Foster and
Fred Barrie at University of Nevada As we expect that the load will
soon outgrow our hardware we will distribute the Veronica service
across other sites in the near future

Please address comments to gophadmfutiquescsunredu

Is this the new world order of automated librarianship


WAIS

Wide Area Information Servers pronounced ways allows users to
get information from a variety of hosts by means of a client
The user tells the client in plain English what to look for
out in dataspace The client then searches various WAIS servers
around the globe The user tells the client how relevant each hit is
and the client can be sent out on the same quest again and again to
find new documents Client software is available for many different
types of computers

WAIStation is an easy to use Macintosh implementation of a WAIS client
It can be downloaded from thinkcom as well as a selfrunning MediaTracks
demo of WAIStation in action Kahle also moderates a thoughtful WAIS
newsletter and discussion group often speculating about the future of
libraries and librarians

WorldWideWeb

Tim BernersLee describes the Web this way The WWW project merges
the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but
powerful global information system The WWW world consists of documents
and links Indexes are special documents which rather than being read
may be searched The result of such a search is another virtual
document containing links to the documents found The Web contains
documents in many formats Those documents which are hypertext
real or virtual contain links to other documents or places
within documents All documents whether real virtual or indexes look
similar to the reader and are contained within the same addressing scheme
To follow a link a reader clicks with a mouse or types in a number if
he or she has no mouse To search and index a reader gives keywords
or other search criteria These are the only operations necessary to
access the entire world of data

access to all Internetaccessible library catalogs FREENETS CWISs
BBSs Gophers WAIS etc is now available You can get it via anonymous
ftp from accessusaskca in the pubhytelnetpc subdirectory It is
listed as HYTELN63ZIP

Version 63 is a major upgrade Much redundant information has been
deleted and errors have been corrected New subdirectories have been
added which has meant that many files now have a more meaningful home
Also all the newupdated files created since Version 62 were incorporated

Note the UNZIPPED files total over 12 mb but remember you can always
edit out any information you do not need in order to save space
Information from Roy Tennant follows slightly edited describing how to
obtain HYTELNET 63 from the ftp site thanks Roy

How to Get Connected

Now that youre interested in what resources are available how does one go
about getting connected Time was that you needed a standard dedicated
connection to the Internet Then you needed a robust computer system and
a couple of zany gurus to keep it all running And once a year you could
expect an invoice in the 30000 range to keep the data flowing

These days anyone can connect from small libraries and nonprofits to
individuals and of course commercialmh And the prices are affordable

There is a NSFNet acceptableuse policy you must agree to adhere to
if your traffic passes through NSFNet It is available from the NSF
Network Service Center

Contact your regional network first to see what services might be available
to you A list of regional nets can be obtained from the NSF Network
Service Center address below or check with a local college or
universitys academic computing center A university may be able to give
you a guest account on its system for educational purposes

Access to electronic mail alone is roughly 20 a month at this writing
Additional capabilities including telnet and ftp cost more and it will
cost 2000 or more per year if you want to operate your own host system
The good news is that the costs are spiraling downwards Here are a few other
methods of connecting to the net Many more are listed in the musthave
books at the end of this article

CERFnet
The California Education and Research Federation CERFnet has announced
DIAL N CERF USA It allows educators scientists corporations and
individuals access to the Internet from anywhere in the continental US

The 5th Revision of the Directory of Scholarly Electronic Conferences

This resource is available at LISTSERVKENTVM or
LISTSERVKENTVMKENTEDU and via anonymous FTP to
ksuvxakentedu
in the
library
directory

This announcement is extracted from the ACADLIST README FILE

This directory contains descriptions of 805 electronic conferences
econferences on topics of interest to scholars E conference is the
umbrella term that includes discussion lists interest groups ejournals
enewsletters Usenet newsgroups forums etc We have used our own
judgment in deciding what is of scholarly interest  and accept any advice
or argument about our decisions We have placed the entries into
categories by deciding what the dominant academic subject area of the
electronic conference is

The 5th Revision involves an attempt to make it easier to feed the
Directory into HyperCardTM dBaseTM and other database programs
The first step in this effort has been to use field labels for each part of
each record Weve also reduced the size of each record by trying to keep
topic information between 2550 words some are still bigger Advice on
this topic will be gratefully accepted at dkovacskentvmkentedu

In addition information about editorial policy and archive availability
and frequency have also been included in each record Where possible the
information in each record has been checked for currency and accuracy by
checking the LISTSERV header in the case of LISTSERV based econferences
and contacting the moderators of other kinds of econferences

The field labels are as follows
LN econference name
TI topic information
SU subscription information
ED edited Yes or No
AR archived if Yes frequency privatesubscribers only
MO moderator editor listowner manager coordinator etc
IA official institutional affiliation

Topic descriptions are taken in whole or part from the descriptions
provided by each listowner editor moderator or coordinator to the
NewList the List of Lists and the Internet Interest Groups file

Conferences for Academics Files If you can provide corrections or

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks
eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks

EBooks posted prior to November 2003 with eBook numbers BELOW 10000
are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year

httpwwwibiblioorggutenbergetext06

 Or etext 05 04 03 02 01 00 99
 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 92 91 or 90

EBooks posted since November 2003 with etext numbers OVER 10000 are
filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is
identical to the filename The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at

httpwwwgutenbergorg102310234

or filename 24689 would be found at
httpwwwgutenbergorg246824689
