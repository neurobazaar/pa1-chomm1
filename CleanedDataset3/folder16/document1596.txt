THE TASTE OF THE MEAT




I


In the beginning he was Christopher Bellew By the time he was at
college he had become Chris Bellew Later in the Bohemian crowd of
San Francisco he was called Kit Bellew And in the end he was known
by no other name than Smoke Bellew And this history of the evolution
of his name is the history of his evolution Nor would it have
happened had he not had a fond mother and an iron uncle and had he not
received a letter from Gillet Bellamy

I have just seen a copy of the Billow Gillet wrote from Paris Of
course OHara will succeed with it But hes missing some plays
Here followed details in the improvement of the budding society
weekly Go down and see him Let him think theyre your own
suggestions Dont let him know theyre from me If he does hell
make me Paris correspondent which I cant afford because Im getting
real money for my stuff from the big magazines Above all dont
forget to make him fire that dub whos doing the musical and art
criticism Another thing San Francisco has always had a literature of
her own But she hasnt any now Tell him to kick around and get some
gink to turn out a live serial and to put into it the real romance and
glamour and colour of San Francisco

And down to the office of the Billow went Kit Bellew faithfully to
instruct OHara listened OHara debated OHara agreed OHara
fired the dub who wrote criticism Further OHara had a way with
himthe very way that was feared by Gillet in distant Paris When
OHara wanted anything no friend could deny him He was sweetly and
compellingly irresistible Before Kit Bellew could escape from the
office he had become an associate editor had agreed to write weekly
columns of criticism till some decent pen was found and had pledged
himself to write a weekly instalment of ten thousand words on the San
Francisco serialand all this without pay The Billow wasnt paying
yet OHara explained and just as convincingly had he exposited that
there was only one man in San Francisco capable of writing the serial
and that man Kit Bellew

Oh Lord Im the gink Kit had groaned to himself afterwards on the
narrow stairway

And thereat had begun his servitude to OHara and the insatiable
columns of the Billow Week after week he held down an office chair
stood off creditors wrangled with printers and turned out twentyfive
thousand words of all sorts weekly Nor did his labours lighten The
Billow was ambitious It went in for illustration The processes were
expensive It never had any money to pay Kit Bellew and by the same
token it was unable to pay for any additions to the office staff

This is what comes of being a good fellow Kit grumbled one day

Thank God for good fellows then OHara cried with tears in his eyes
as he gripped Kits hand Youre all thats saved me Kit But for
you Id have gone bust Just a little longer old man and things will
be easier

Never was Kits plaint I see my fate clearly I shall be here
always

A little later he thought he saw his way out Watching his chance in
OHaras presence he fell over a chair A few minutes afterwards he
bumped into the corner of the desk and with fumbling fingers
capsized a paste pot

Out late OHara queried

Kit brushed his eyes with his hands and peered about him anxiously
before replying

No its not that Its my eyes They seem to be going back on me
thats all

For several days he continued to fall over and bump into the office
furniture But OHaras heart was not softened

I tell you what Kit he said one day youve got to see an oculist
Theres Doctor Hassdapple Hes a crackerjack And it wont cost you
anything We can get it for advertizing Ill see him myself

And true to his word he dispatched Kit to the oculist

Theres nothing the matter with your eyes was the doctors verdict
after a lengthy examination In fact your eyes are magnificenta
pair in a million

Dont tell OHara Kit pleaded And give me a pair of black
glasses

The result of this was that OHara sympathized and talked glowingly of
the time when the Billow would be on its feet

Luckily for Kit Bellew he had his own income Small it was compared
with some yet it was large enough to enable him to belong to several
clubs and maintain a studio in the Latin Quarter In point of fact
since his associate editorship his expenses had decreased
prodigiously He had no time to spend money He never saw the studio
any more nor entertained the local Bohemians with his famous
chafingdish suppers Yet he was always broke for the Billow in
perennial distress absorbed his cash as well as his brains There
were the illustrators who periodically refused to illustrate the
printers who periodically refused to print and the office boy who
frequently refused to officiate At such times OHara looked at Kit
and Kit did the rest

When the steamship Excelsior arrived from Alaska bringing the news of
the Klondike strike that set the country mad Kit made a purely
frivolous proposition

Look here OHara he said This gold rush is going to be bigthe
days of 49 over again Suppose I cover it for the Billow Ill pay my
own expenses

OHara shook his head

Cant spare you from the office Kit Then theres that serial
Besides I saw Jackson not an hour ago Hes starting for the Klondike
tomorrow and hes agreed to send a weekly letter and photos I
wouldnt let him get away till he promised And the beauty of it is
that it doesnt cost us anything

The next Kit heard of the Klondike was when he dropped into the club
that afternoon and in an alcove off the library encountered his
uncle

Hello avuncular relative Kit greeted sliding into a leather chair
and spreading out his legs Wont you join me

He ordered a cocktail but the uncle contented himself with the thin
native claret he invariably drank He glanced with irritated
disapproval at the cocktail and on to his nephews face Kit saw a
lecture gathering

Ive only a minute he announced hastily Ive got to run and take
in that Keith exhibition at Ellerys and do half a column on it

Whats the matter with you the other demanded Youre pale Youre
a wreck

Kits only answer was a groan

Ill have the pleasure of burying you I can see that

Kit shook his head sadly

No destroying worm thank you Cremation for mine

John Bellew came of the old hard and hardy stock that had crossed the
plains by oxteam in the fifties and in him was this same hardness and
the hardness of a childhood spent in the conquering of a new land

Youre not living right Christopher Im ashamed of you

Primrose path eh Kit chuckled

The older man shrugged his shoulders

Shake not your gory locks at me avuncular I wish it were the
primrose path But thats all cut out I have no time

Then what in

Overwork

John Bellew laughed harshly and incredulously

Honest

Again came the laughter

Men are the products of their environment Kit proclaimed pointing
at the others glass Your mirth is thin and bitter as your drink

Overwork was the sneer You never earned a cent in your life

You bet I haveonly I never got it Im earning five hundred a week
right now and doing four mens work

Pictures that wont sell Orerfancy work of some sort Can you
swim

I used to

Sit a horse

I have essayed that adventure

John Bellew snorted his disgust

Im glad your father didnt live to see you in all the glory of your
gracelessness he said Your father was a man every inch of him
Do you get it A Man I think hed have whaled all this musical and
artistic tomfoolery out of you

Alas these degenerate days Kit sighed

I could understand it and tolerate it the other went on savagely
if you succeeded at it Youve never earned a cent in your life nor
done a tap of mans work

Etchings and pictures and fans Kit contributed unsoothingly

Youre a dabbler and a failure What pictures have you painted Dinky
watercolours and nightmare posters Youve never had one exhibited
even here in San Francisco

Ah you forget There is one in the jinks room of this very club

A gross cartoon Music Your dear fool of a mother spent hundreds on
lessons Youve dabbled and failed Youve never even earned a
fivedollar piece by accompanying some one at a concert Your
songsragtime rot thats never printed and thats sung only by a
pack of fake Bohemians

I had a book published oncethose sonnets you remember Kit
interposed meekly

What did it cost you

Only a couple of hundred

Any other achievements

I had a forest play acted at the summer jinks

What did you get for it

Glory

And you used to swim and you have essayed to sit a horse John
Bellew set his glass down with unnecessary violence What earthly
good are you anyway You were well put up yet even at university you
didnt play football You didnt row You didnt

I boxed and fencedsome

When did you last box

Not since but I was considered an excellent judge of time and
distance only I waser

Go on

Considered desultory

Lazy you mean

I always imagined it was an euphemism

My father sir your grandfather old Isaac Bellew killed a man with
a blow of his fist when he was sixtynine years old

The man

No youryou graceless scamp But youll never kill a mosquito at
sixtynine

The times have changed oh my avuncular They send men to state
prisons for homicide now

Your father rode one hundred and eightyfive miles without sleeping
and killed three horses

Had he lived today hed have snored over the course in a Pullman

The older man was on the verge of choking with wrath but swallowed it
down and managed to articulate

How old are you

I have reason to believe

I know Twentyseven You finished college at twentytwo Youve
dabbled and played and frilled for five years Before God and man of
what use are you When I was your age I had one suit of underclothes
I was riding with the cattle in Colusa I was hard as rocks and I
could sleep on a rock I lived on jerked beef and bearmeat I am a
better man physically right now than you are You weigh about one
hundred and sixtyfive I can throw you right now or thrash you with
my fists

It doesnt take a physical prodigy to mop up cocktails or pink tea
Kit murmured deprecatingly Dont you see my avuncular the times
have changed Besides I wasnt brought up right My dear fool of a
mother

John Bellew started angrily

As you described her was too good to me kept me in cotton wool and
all the rest Now if when I was a youngster I had taken some of those
intensely masculine vacations you go in forI wonder why you didnt
invite me sometimes You took Hal and Robbie all over the Sierras and
on that Mexico trip

I guess you were too Lord Fauntleroyish

Your fault avuncular and my dearermothers How was I to know
the hard I was only a cheeild What was there left but etchings and
pictures and fans Was it my fault that I never had to sweat

The older man looked at his nephew with unconcealed disgust He had no
patience with levity from the lips of softness

Well Im going to take another one of those whatyoucall masculine
vacations Suppose I asked you to come along

Rather belated I must say Where is it

Hal and Robert are going in to Klondike and Im going to see them
across the Pass and down to the Lakes then return

He got no further for the young man had sprung forward and gripped his
hand

My preserver

John Bellew was immediately suspicious He had not dreamed the
invitation would be accepted

You dont mean it he said

When do we start

It will be a hard trip Youll be in the way

No I wont Ill work Ive learned to work since I went on the
Billow

Each man has to take a years supplies in with him Therell be such
a jam the Indian packers wont be able to handle it Hal and Robert
will have to pack their outfits across themselves Thats what Im
going along forto help them pack It you come youll have to do the
same

Watch me

You cant pack was the objection

When do we start

Tomorrow

You neednt take it to yourself that your lecture on the hard has done
it Kit said at parting I just had to get away somewhere
anywhere from OHara

Who is OHara A Jap

No hes an Irishman and a slavedriver and my best friend Hes
the editor and proprietor and allaround big squeeze of the Billow
What he says goes He can make ghosts walk

That night Kit Bellew wrote a note to OHara

Its only a several weeks vacation he explained Youll have to
get some gink to dope out instalments for that serial Sorry old man
but my health demands it Ill kick in twice as hard when I get back



II

Kit Bellew landed through the madness of the Dyea beach congested with
thousandpound outfits of thousands of men This immense mass of
luggage and food flung ashore in mountains by the steamers was
beginning slowly to dribble up the Dyea valley and across Chilcoot It
was a portage of twentyeight miles and could be accomplished only on
the backs of men Despite the fact that the Indian packers had jumped
the freight from eight cents a pound to forty they were swamped with
the work and it was plain that winter would catch the major portion of
the outfits on the wrong side of the divide

Tenderest of the tenderfeet was Kit Like many hundreds of others he
carried a big revolver swung on a cartridgebelt Of this his uncle
filled with memories of old lawless days was likewise guilty But Kit
Bellew was romantic He was fascinated by the froth and sparkle of the
gold rush and viewed its life and movement with an artists eye He
did not take it seriously As he said on the steamer it was not his
funeral He was merely on a vacation and intended to peep over the
top of the pass for a look see and then to return

Leaving his party on the sand to wait for the putting ashore of the
freight he strolled up the beach toward the old trading post He did
not swagger though he noticed that many of the berevolvered
individuals did A strapping sixfoot Indian passed him carrying an
unusually large pack Kit swung in behind admiring the splendid
calves of the man and the grace and ease with which he moved along
under his burden The Indian dropped his pack on the scales in front
of the post and Kit joined the group of admiring goldrushers who
surrounded him The pack weighed one hundred and twenty pounds which
fact was uttered back and forth in tones of awe It was going some
Kit decided and he wondered if he could lift such a weight much less
walk off with it

Going to Lake Linderman with it old man he asked

The Indian swelling with pride grunted an affirmative

How much you make that one pack

Fifty dollar

Here Kit slid out of the conversation A young woman standing in the
doorway had caught his eye Unlike other women landing from the
steamers she was neither shortskirted nor bloomerclad She was
dressed as any woman travelling anywhere would be dressed What struck
him was the justness of her being there a feeling that somehow she
belonged Moreover she was young and pretty The bright beauty and
colour of her oval face held him and he looked overlonglooked till
she resented and her own eyes longlashed and dark met his in cool
survey

From his face they travelled in evident amusement down to the big
revolver at his thigh Then her eyes came back to his and in them was
amused contempt It struck him like a blow She turned to the man
beside her and indicated Kit The man glanced him over with the same
amused contempt

Chechaquo the girl said

The man who looked like a tramp in his cheap overalls and dilapidated
woollen jacket grinned dryly and Kit felt withered though he knew not
why But anyway she was an unusually pretty girl he decided as the
two moved off He noted the way of her walk and recorded the judgment
that he would recognize it after the lapse of a thousand years

Did you see that man with the girl Kits neighbour asked him
excitedly Know who he is

Kit shook his head

Cariboo Charley He was just pointed out to me He struck it big on
Klondike Old timer Been on the Yukon a dozen years Hes just come
out

Whats chechaquo mean Kit asked

Youre one Im one was the answer

Maybe I am but youve got to search me What does it mean

Tenderfoot

On his way back to the beach Kit turned the phrase over and over It
rankled to be called tenderfoot by a slender chit of a woman

Going into a corner among the heaps of freight his mind still filled
with the vision of the Indian with the redoubtable pack Kit essayed to
learn his own strength He picked out a sack of flour which he knew
weighed an even hundred pounds He stepped astride of it reached
down and strove to get it on his shoulder His first conclusion was
that one hundred pounds was the real heavy His next was that his back
was weak His third was an oath and it occurred at the end of five
futile minutes when he collapsed on top of the burden with which he
was wrestling He mopped his forehead and across a heap of grubsacks
saw John Bellew gazing at him wintry amusement in his eyes

God proclaimed that apostle of the hard Out of our loins has come
a race of weaklings When I was sixteen I toyed with things like that

You forget avuncular Kit retorted that I wasnt raised on
bearmeat

And Ill toy with it when Im sixty

Youve got to show me

John Bellew did He was fortyeight but he bent over the sack
applied a tentative shifting grip that balanced it and with a quick
heave stood erect the somersaulted sack of flour on his shoulder

Knack my boy knackand a spine

Kit took off his hat reverently

Youre a wonder avuncular a shining wonder Dye think I can learn
the knack

John Bellew shrugged his shoulders

Youll be hitting the back trail before we get started

Never you fear Kit groaned Theres OHara the roaring lion down
there Im not going back till I have to



III

Kits first pack was a success Up to Finnegans Crossing they had
managed to get Indians to carry the twentyfive hundredpound outfit
From that point their own backs must do the work They planned to move
forward at the rate of a mile a day It looked easyon paper Since
John Bellew was to stay in camp and do the cooking he would be unable
to make more than an occasional pack so to each of the three young
men fell the task of carrying eight hundred pounds one mile each day
If they made fiftypound packs it meant a daily walk of sixteen miles
loaded and of fifteen miles lightBecause we dont backtrip the last
time Kit explained the pleasant discovery eightypound packs meant
nineteen miles travel each day and hundredpound packs meant only
fifteen miles

I dont like walking said Kit Therefore I shall carry one hundred
pounds He caught the grin of incredulity on his uncles face and
added hastily Of course I shall work up to it A fellows got to
learn the ropes and tricks Ill start with fifty

He did and ambled gaily along the trail He dropped the sack at the
next campsite and ambled back It was easier than he had thought
But two miles had rubbed off the velvet of his strength and exposed the
underlying softness His second pack was sixtyfive pounds It was
more difficult and he no longer ambled Several times following the
custom of all packers he sat down on the ground resting the pack
behind him on a rock or stump With the third pack he became bold He
fastened the straps to a ninetyfivepound sack of beans and started
At the end of a hundred yards he felt that he must collapse He sat
down and mopped his face

Short hauls and short rests he muttered Thats the trick

Sometimes he did not make a hundred yards and each time he struggled
to his feet for another short haul the pack became undeniably heavier
He panted for breath and the sweat streamed from him Before he had
covered a quarter of a mile he stripped off his woollen shirt and hung
it on a tree A little later he discarded his hat At the end of half
a mile he decided he was finished He had never exerted himself so in
his life and he knew that he was finished As he sat and panted his
gaze fell upon the big revolver and the heavy cartridgebelt

Ten pounds of junk he sneered as he unbuckled it

He did not bother to hang it on a tree but flung it into the
underbush And as the steady tide of packers flowed by him up trail
and down he noted that the other tenderfeet were beginning to shed
their shooting irons

His short hauls decreased At times a hundred feet was all he could
stagger and then the ominous pounding of his heart against his
eardrums and the sickening totteriness of his knees compelled him to
rest And his rests grew longer But his mind was busy It was a
twentyeight mile portage which represented as many days and this by
all accounts was the easiest part of it Wait till you get to
Chilcoot others told him as they rested and talked where you climb
with hands and feet

They aint going to be no Chilcoot was his answer Not for me
Long before that Ill be at peace in my little couch beneath the moss

A slip and a violent wrenching effort at recovery frightened him He
felt that everything inside him had been torn asunder

If ever I fall down with this on my back Im a goner he told another
packer

Thats nothing came the answer Wait till you hit the Canyon
Youll have to cross a raging torrent on a sixtyfoot pine tree No
guide ropes nothing and the water boiling at the sag of the log to
your knees If you fall with a pack on your back theres no getting
out of the straps You just stay there and drown

Sounds good to me he retorted and out of the depths of his
exhaustion he almost half meant it

They drown three or four a day there the man assured him I helped
fish a German out there He had four thousand in greenbacks on him

Cheerful I must say said Kit battling his way to his feet and
tottering on

He and the sack of beans became a perambulating tragedy It reminded
him of the old man of the sea who sat on Sinbads neck And this was
one of those intensely masculine vacations he meditated Compared
with it the servitude to OHara was sweet Again and again he was
nearly seduced by the thought of abandoning the sack of beans in the
brush and of sneaking around the camp to the beach and catching a
steamer for civilization

But he didnt Somewhere in him was the strain of the hard and he
repeated over and over to himself that what other men could do he
could It became a nightmare chant and he gibbered it to those that
passed him on the trail At other times resting he watched and
envied the stolid mulefooted Indians that plodded by under heavier
packs They never seemed to rest but went on and on with a steadiness
and certitude that was to him appalling

He sat and cursedhe had no breath for it when under wayand fought
the temptation to sneak back to San Francisco Before the mile pack
was ended he ceased cursing and took to crying The tears were tears
of exhaustion and of disgust with self If ever a man was a wreck he
was As the end of the pack came in sight he strained himself in
desperation gained the campsite and pitched forward on his face the
beans on his back It did not kill him but he lay for fifteen minutes
before he could summon sufficient shreds of strength to release himself
from the straps Then he became deathly sick and was so found by
Robbie who had similar troubles of his own It was this sickness of
Robbie that braced him up

What other men can do we can do Kit told him though down in his
heart he wondered whether or not he was bluffing



IV

And I am twentyseven years old and a man he privately assured
himself many times in the days that followed There was need for it
At the end of a week though he had succeeded in moving his eight
hundred pounds forward a mile a day he had lost fifteen pounds of his
own weight His face was lean and haggard All resilience had gone
out of his body and mind He no longer walked but plodded And on
the backtrips travelling light his feet dragged almost as much as
when he was loaded

He had become a work animal He fell asleep over his food and his
sleep was heavy and beastly save when he was aroused screaming with
agony by the cramps in his legs Every part of him ached He tramped
on raw blisters yet this was even easier than the fearful bruising his
feet received on the waterrounded rocks of the Dyea Flats across
which the trail led for two miles These two miles represented
thirtyeight miles of travelling He washed his face once a day His
nails torn and broken and afflicted with hangnails were never
cleaned His shoulders and chest galled by the packstraps made him
think and for the first time with understanding of the horses he had
seen on city streets

One ordeal that nearly destroyed him at first had been the food The
extraordinary amount of work demanded extraordinary stoking and his
stomach was unaccustomed to great quantities of bacon and of the
coarse highly poisonous brown beans As a result his stomach went
back on him and for several days the pain and irritation of it and of
starvation nearly broke him down And then came the day of joy when he
could eat like a ravenous animal and wolfeyed ask for more

When they had moved the outfit across the footlogs at the mouth of the
Canyon they made a change in their plans Word had come across the
Pass that at Lake Linderman the last available trees for building boats
were being cut The two cousins with tools whipsaw blankets and
grub on their backs went on leaving Kit and his uncle to hustle along
the outfit John Bellew now shared the cooking with Kit and both
packed shoulder to shoulder Time was flying and on the peaks the
first snow was falling To be caught on the wrong side of the Pass
meant a delay of nearly a year The older man put his iron back under
a hundred pounds Kit was shocked but he gritted his teeth and
fastened his own straps to a hundred pounds It hurt but he had
learned the knack and his body purged of all softness and fat was
beginning to harden up with lean and bitter muscle Also he observed
and devised He took note of the headstraps worn by the Indians and
manufactured one for himself which he used in addition to the
shoulderstraps It made things easier so that he began the practice
of piling any light cumbersome piece of luggage on top Thus he was
soon able to bend along with a hundred pounds in the straps fifteen or
twenty more lying loosely on top the pack and against his neck an axe
or a pair of oars in one hand and in the other the nested
cookingpails of the camp

But work as they would the toil increased The trail grew more
rugged their packs grew heavier and each day saw the snowline
dropping down the mountains while freight jumped to sixty cents No
word came from the cousins beyond so they knew they must be at work
chopping down the standing trees and whipsawing them into boatplanks
John Bellew grew anxious Capturing a bunch of Indians backtripping
from Lake Linderman he persuaded them to put their straps on the
outfit They charged thirty cents a pound to carry it to the summit of
Chilcoot and it nearly broke him As it was some four hundred pounds
of clothesbags and camp outfit was not handled He remained behind to
move it along dispatching Kit with the Indians At the summit Kit was
to remain slowly moving his ton until overtaken by the four hundred
pounds with which his uncle guaranteed to catch him



V

Kit plodded along the trail with his Indian packers In recognition of
the fact that it was to be a long pack straight to the top of
Chilcoot his own load was only eighty pounds The Indians plodded
under their loads but it was a quicker gait than he had practised Yet
he felt no apprehension and by now had come to deem himself almost the
equal of an Indian

At the end of a quarter of a mile he desired to rest But the Indians
kept on He stayed with them and kept his place in the line At the
half mile he was convinced that he was incapable of another step yet
he gritted his teeth kept his place and at the end of the mile was
amazed that he was still alive Then in some strange way came the
thing called second wind and the next mile was almost easier than the
first The third mile nearly killed him and though half delirious
with pain and fatigue he never whimpered And then when he felt he
must surely faint came the rest Instead of sitting in the straps as
was the custom of the white packers the Indians slipped out of the
shoulder and headstraps and lay at ease talking and smoking A full
half hour passed before they made another start To Kits surprise he
found himself a fresh man and long hauls and long rests became his
newest motto

The pitch of Chilcoot was all he had heard of it and many were the
occasions when he climbed with hands as well as feet But when he
reached the crest of the divide in the thick of a driving snowsquall
it was in the company of his Indians and his secret pride was that he
had come through with them and never squealed and never lagged To be
almost as good as an Indian was a new ambition to cherish

When he had paid off the Indians and seen them depart a stormy
darkness was falling and he was left alone a thousand feet above
timber line on the backbone of a mountain Wet to the waist
famished and exhausted he would have given a years income for a fire
and a cup of coffee Instead he ate half a dozen cold flapjacks and
crawled into the folds of the partly unrolled tent As he dozed off he
had time only for one fleeting thought and he grinned with vicious
pleasure at the picture of John Bellew in the days to follow
masculinely backtripping his four hundred pounds up Chilcoot As for
himself even though burdened with two thousand pounds he was bound
down the hill

In the morning stiff from his labours and numb with the frost he
rolled out of the canvas ate a couple of pounds of uncooked bacon
buckled the straps on a hundred pounds and went down the rocky way
Several hundred yards beneath the trail led across a small glacier and
down to Crater Lake Other men packed across the glacier All that
day he dropped his packs at the glaciers upper edge and by virtue of
the shortness of the pack he put his straps on one hundred and fifty
pounds each load His astonishment at being able to do it never
abated For two dollars he bought from an Indian three leathery
seabiscuits and out of these and a huge quantity of raw bacon made
several meals Unwashed unwarmed his clothing wet with sweat he
slept another night in the canvas

In the early morning he spread a tarpaulin on the ice loaded it with
threequarters of a ton and started to pull Where the pitch of the
glacier accelerated his load likewise accelerated overran him
scooped him in on top and ran away with him

A hundred packers bending under their loads stopped to watch him He
yelled frantic warnings and those in his path stumbled and staggered
clear Below on the lower edge of the glacier was pitched a small
tent which seemed leaping toward him so rapidly did it grow larger
He left the beaten track where the packers trail swerved to the left
and struck a patch of fresh snow This arose about him in frosty
smoke while it reduced his speed He saw the tent the instant he
struck it carrying away the corner guys bursting in the front flaps
and fetching up inside still on top of the tarpaulin and in the midst
of his grubsacks The tent rocked drunkenly and in the frosty vapour
he found himself face to face with a startled young woman who was
sitting up in her blanketsthe very one who had called him chechaquo
at Dyea

Did you see my smoke he queried cheerfully

She regarded him with disapproval

Talk about your magic carpets he went on

Do you mind removing that sack from my foot she said coldly

He looked and lifted his weight quickly

It wasnt a sack It was my elbow Pardon me

The information did not perturb her and her coolness was a challenge

It was a mercy you did not overturn the stove she said

He followed her glance and saw a sheetiron stove and a coffeepot
attended by a young squaw He sniffed the coffee and looked back to
the girl

Im a chechaquo he said

Her bored expression told him that he was stating the obvious But he
was unabashed

Ive shed my shootingirons he added

Then she recognized him and her eyes lighted

I never thought youd get this far she informed him

Again and greedily he sniffed the air

As I live coffee He turned and directly addressed her Ill give
you my little fingercut it right off now Ill do anything Ill be
your slave for a year and a day or any other odd time if youll give
me a cup out of that pot

And over the coffee he gave his name and learned hersJoy Gastell
Also he learned that she was an oldtimer in the country She had
been born in a trading post on the Great Slave and as a child had
crossed the Rockies with her father and come down to the Yukon She
was going in she said with her father who had been delayed by
business in Seattle and who had then been wrecked on the illfated
Chanter and carried back to Puget Sound by the rescuing steamer

In view of the fact that she was still in her blankets he did not make
it a long conversation and heroically declining a second cup of
coffee he removed himself and his quarter of a ton of baggage from her
tent Further he took several conclusions away with him she had a
fetching name and fetching eyes could not be more than twenty or
twentyone or two her father must be French she had a will of her
own and temperament to burn and she had been educated elsewhere than
on the frontier

Over the icescoured rocks and above the timberline the trail ran
around Crater Lake and gained the rocky defile that led toward Happy
Camp and the first scrub pines To pack his heavy outfit around would
take days of heartbreaking toil On the lake was a canvas boat
employed in freighting Two trips with it in two hours would see him
and his ton across But he was broke and the ferryman charged forty
dollars a ton

Youve got a goldmine my friend in that dinky boat Kit said to
the ferryman Do you want another goldmine

Show me was the answer

Ill sell it to you for the price of ferrying my outfit Its an
idea not patented and you can jump the deal as soon as I tell you it
Are you game

The ferryman said he was and Kit liked his looks

Very well You see that glacier Take a pickaxe and wade into it
In a day you can have a decent groove from top to bottom See the
point The Chilcoot and Crater Lake Consolidated Chute Corporation
Limited You can charge fifty cents a hundred get a hundred tons a
day and have no work to do but collect the coin

Two hours later Kits ton was across the lake and he had gained three
days on himself And when John Bellew overtook him he was well along
toward Deep Lake another volcanic pit filled with glacial water



VII

The last pack from Long Lake to Linderman was three miles and the
trail if trail it could be called rose up over a thousandfoot
hogback dropped down a scramble of slippery rocks and crossed a wide
stretch of swamp John Bellew remonstrated when he saw Kit arise with
a hundred pounds in the straps and pick up a fiftypound sack of flour
and place it on top of the pack against the back of his neck

Come on you chunk of the hard Kit retorted Kick in on your
bearmeat fodder and your one suit of underclothes

But John Bellew shook his head

Im afraid Im getting old Christopher

Youre only fortyeight Do you realize that my grandfather sir
your father old Isaac Bellew killed a man with his fist when he was
sixtynine years old

John Bellew grinned and swallowed his medicine

Avuncular I want to tell you something important I was raised a
Lord Fauntleroy but I can outpack you outwalk you put you on your
back or lick you with my fists right now

John Bellew thrust out his hand and spoke solemnly

Christopher my boy I believe you can do it I believe you can do it
with that pack on your back at the same time Youve made good boy
though its too unthinkable to believe

Kit made the round trip of the last pack four times a day which is to
say that he daily covered twentyfour miles of mountain climbing
twelve miles of it under one hundred and fifty pounds He was proud
hard and tired but in splendid physical condition He ate and slept
as he had never eaten and slept in his life and as the end of the work
came in sight he was almost half sorry

One problem bothered him He had learned that he could fall with a
hundredweight on his back and survive but he was confident if he fell
with that additional fifty pounds across the back of his neck that it
would break it clean Each trail through the swamp was quickly churned
bottomless by the thousands of packers who were compelled continually
to make new trails It was while pioneering such a new trail that he
solved the problem of the extra fifty

The soft lush surface gave way under him he floundered and pitched
forward on his face The fifty pounds crushed his face in the mud and
went clear without snapping his neck With the remaining hundred
pounds on his back he arose on hands and knees But he got no farther
One arm sank to the shoulder pillowing his cheek in the slush As he
drew this arm clear the other sank to the shoulder In this position
it was impossible to slip the straps and the hundredweight on his back
would not let him rise On hands and knees sinking first one arm and
then the other he made an effort to crawl to where the small sack of
flour had fallen But he exhausted himself without advancing and so
churned and broke the grass surface that a tiny pool of water began to
form in perilous proximity to his mouth and nose

He tried to throw himself on his back with the pack underneath but
this resulted in sinking both arms to the shoulders and gave him a
foretaste of drowning With exquisite patience he slowly withdrew one
sucking arm and then the other and rested them flat on the surface for
the support of his chin Then he began to call for help After a time
he heard the sound of feet sucking through the mud as some one advanced
from behind

Lend a hand friend he said Throw out a lifeline or something

It was a womans voice that answered and he recognized it

If youll unbuckle the straps I can get up

The hundred pounds rolled into the mud with a soggy noise and he
slowly gained his feet

A pretty predicament Miss Gastell laughed at sight of his
mudcovered face

Not at all he replied airily My favourite physical exercise
stunt Try it some time Its great for the pectoral muscles and the
spine

He wiped his face flinging the slush from his hand with a snappy jerk

Oh she cried in recognition Its MrahMr Smoke Bellew

I thank you gravely for your timely rescue and for that name he
answered I have been doubly baptized Henceforth I shall insist
always on being called Smoke Bellew It is a strong name and not
without significance

He paused and then voice and expression became suddenly fierce

Do you know what Im going to do he demanded Im going back to
the States I am going to get married I am going to raise a large
family of children And then as the evening shadows fall I shall
gather those children about me and relate the sufferings and hardships
I endured on the Chilcoot Trail And if they dont cryI repeat if
they dont cry Ill lambaste the stuffing out of them



VIII

The arctic winter came down apace Snow that had come to stay lay six
inches on the ground and the ice was forming in quiet ponds despite
the fierce gales that blew It was in the late afternoon during a
lull in such a gale that Kit and John Bellew helped the cousins load
the boat and watched it disappear down the lake in a snowsquall

And now a nights sleep and an early start in the morning said John
Bellew If we arent stormbound at the summit well make Dyea
tomorrow night and if we have luck in catching a steamer well be in
San Francisco in a week

Enjoyed your vacation Kit asked absently

Their camp for that last night at Linderman was a melancholy remnant
Everything of use including the tent had been taken by the cousins
A tattered tarpaulin stretched as a windbreak partially sheltered
them from the driving snow Supper they cooked on an open fire in a
couple of battered and discarded camp utensils All that was left them
were their blankets and food for several meals

From the moment of the departure of the boat Kit had become absent and
restless His uncle noticed his condition and attributed it to the
fact that the end of the hard toil had come Only once during supper
did Kit speak

Avuncular he said relevant of nothing after this I wish youd
call me Smoke Ive made some smoke on this trail havent I

A few minutes later he wandered away in the direction of the village of
tents that sheltered the goldrushers who were still packing or
building their boats He was gone several hours and when he returned
and slipped into his blankets John Bellew was asleep

In the darkness of a galedriven morning Kit crawled out built a fire
in his stocking feet by which he thawed out his frozen shoes then
boiled coffee and fried bacon It was a chilly miserable meal As
soon as finished they strapped their blankets As John Bellew turned
to lead the way toward the Chilcoot Trail Kit held out his hand

Goodbye avuncular he said

John Bellew looked at him and swore in his surprise

Dont forget my names Smoke Kit chided

But what are you going to do

Kit waved his hand in a general direction northward over the
stormlashed lake

Whats the good of turning back after getting this far he asked
Besides Ive got my taste of meat and I like it Im going on

Youre broke protested John Bellew You have no outfit

Ive got a job Behold your nephew Christopher Smoke Bellew Hes
got a job at a hundred and fifty per month and grub Hes going down
to Dawson with a couple of dudes and another gentlemans
mancampcook boatman and general allaround hustler And OHara
and the Billow can go to hell Goodbye

But John Bellew was dazed and could only mutter

I dont understand

They say the baldface grizzlies are thick in the Yukon Basin Kit
explained Well Ive got only one suit of underclothes and Im
going after the bearmeat thats all




THE MEAT




I

Half the time the wind blew a gale and Smoke Bellew staggered against
it along the beach In the gray of dawn a dozen boats were being
loaded with the precious outfits packed across Chilcoot They were
clumsy homemade boats put together by men who were not
boatbuilders out of planks they had sawed by hand from green spruce
trees One boat already loaded was just starting and Kit paused to
watch

The wind which was fair down the lake here blew in squarely on the
beach kicking up a nasty sea in the shallows The men of the
departing boat waded in high rubber boots as they shoved it out toward
deeper water Twice they did this Clambering aboard and failing to
row clear the boat was swept back and grounded Kit noticed that the
spray on the sides of the boat quickly turned to ice The third
attempt was a partial success The last two men to climb in were wet
to their waists but the boat was afloat They struggled awkwardly at
the heavy oars and slowly worked off shore Then they hoisted a sail
made of blankets had it carried away in a gust and were swept a third
time back on the freezing beach

Kit grinned to himself and went on This was what he must expect to
encounter for he too in his new role of gentlemans man was to
start from the beach in a similar boat that very day

Everywhere men were at work and at work desperately for the closing
down of winter was so imminent that it was a gamble whether or not they
would get across the great chain of lakes before the freezeup Yet
when Kit arrived at the tent of Messrs Sprague and Stine he did not
find them stirring

By a fire under the shelter of a tarpaulin squatted a short thick
man smoking a brownpaper cigarette

Hello he said Are you Mister Spragues new man

As Kit nodded he thought he had noted a shade of emphasis on the
mister and the man and he was sure of a hint of a twinkle in the
corner of the eye

Well Im Doc Stines man the other went on Im five feet two
inches long and my names Shorty Jack Short for short and sometimes
known as JohnnyontheSpot

Kit put out his hand and shook

Were you raised on bearmeat he queried

Sure was the answer though my first feedin was buffalomilk as
near as I can remember Sit down an have some grub The bosses aint
turned out yet

And despite the one breakfast Kit sat down under the tarpaulin and ate
a second breakfast thrice as hearty The heavy purging toil of weeks
had given him the stomach and appetite of a wolf He could eat
anything in any quantity and be unaware that he possessed a
digestion Shorty he found voluble and pessimistic and from him he
received surprising tips concerning their bosses and ominous forecasts
of the expedition Thomas Stanley Sprague was a budding mining
engineer and the son of a millionaire Doctor Adolph Stine was also
the son of a wealthy father And through their fathers both had been
backed by an investing syndicate in the Klondike adventure

Oh theyre sure made of money Shorty expounded When they hit the
beach at Dyea freight was seventy cents but no Indians There was a
party from Eastern Oregon real miners thatd managed to get a team of
Indians together at seventy cents Indians had the straps on the
outfit three thousand pounds of it when along comes Sprague and
Stine They offered eighty cents and ninety and at a dollar a pound
the Indians jumped the contract and took off their straps Sprague and
Stine came through though it cost them three thousand and the Oregon
bunch is still on the beach They wont get through till next year

Oh they are real hummers your boss and mine when it comes to
sheddin the mazuma an never mindin other folks feelins What did
they do when they hit Linderman The carpenters was just putting in
the last licks on a boat theyd contracted to a Frisco bunch for six
hundred Sprague and Stine slipped em an even thousand and they
jumped their contract Its a goodlookin boat but its jiggered the
other bunch Theyve got their outfit right here but no boat And
theyre stuck for next year

Have another cup of coffee and take it from me that I wouldnt travel
with no such outfit if I didnt want to get to Klondike so blamed bad
They aint hearted right Theyd take the crape off the door of a
house in mourning if they needed it in their business Did you sign a
contract

Kit shook his head

Then Im sorry for you pardner They aint no grub in the country
and theyll drop you cold as soon as they hit Dawson Men are going to
starve there this winter

They agreed Kit began

Verbal Shorty snapped him short Its your say so against theirs
thats all Well anywaywhats your name pardner

Call me Smoke said Kit

Well Smoke youll have a run for your verbal contract just the same
This is a plain sample of what to expect They can sure shed mazuma
but they cant work or turn out of bed in the morning We should have
been loaded and started an hour ago Its you an me for the big work
Pretty soon youll hear em shoutin for their coffeein bed mind
you and they grown men What dye know about boatin on the water
Im a cowman and a prospector but Im sure tenderfooted on water an
they dont know punkins What dye know

Search me Kit answered snuggling in closer under the tarpaulin as
the snow whirled before a fiercer gust I havent been on a small
boat since a boy But I guess we can learn

A corner of the tarpaulin tore loose and Shorty received a jet of
driven snow down the back of his neck

Oh we can learn all right he muttered wrathfully Sure we can A
child can learn But its dollars to doughnuts we dont even get
started today

It was eight oclock when the call for coffee came from the tent and
nearly nine before the two employers emerged

Hello said Sprague a rosycheeked wellfed young man of
twentyfive Time we made a start Shorty You and Here he
glanced interrogatively at Kit I didnt quite catch your name last
evening

Smoke

Well Shorty you and Mr Smoke had better begin loading the boat

Plain Smokecut out the Mister Kit suggested

Sprague nodded curtly and strolled away among the tents to be followed
by Doctor Stine a slender pallid young man

Shorty looked significantly at his companion

Over a ton and a half of outfit and they wont lend a hand Youll
see

I guess its because were paid to do the work Kit answered
cheerfully and we might as well buck in

To move three thousand pounds on the shoulders a hundred yards was no
slight task and to do it in half a gale slushing through the snow in
heavy rubber boots was exhausting In addition there was the taking
down of the tent and the packing of small camp equipage Then came the
loading As the boat settled it had to be shoved farther and farther
out increasing the distance they had to wade By two oclock it had
all been accomplished and Kit despite his two breakfasts was weak
with the faintness of hunger His knees were shaking under him
Shorty in similar predicament foraged through the pots and pans and
drew forth a big pot of cold boiled beans in which were imbedded large
chunks of bacon There was only one spoon a longhandled one and
they dipped turn and turn about into the pot Kit was filled with an
immense certitude that in all his life he had never tasted anything so
good

Lord man he mumbled between chews I never knew what appetite was
till I hit the trail

Sprague and Stine arrived in the midst of this pleasant occupation

Whats the delay Sprague complained Arent we ever going to get
started

Shorty dipped in turn and passed the spoon to Kit Nor did either
speak till the pot was empty and the bottom scraped

Of course we aint ben doin nothing Shorty said wiping his mouth
with the back of his hand We aint ben doin nothing at all And of
course you aint had nothing to eat It was sure careless of me

Yes yes Stine said quickly We ate at one of the tentsfriends
of ours

Thought so Shorty grunted

But now that youre finished let us get started Sprague urged

Theres the boat said Shorty Shes sure loaded Now just how
might you be goin about to get started

By climbing aboard and shoving off Come on

They waded out and the employers got on board while Kit and Shorty
shoved clear When the waves lapped the tops of their boots they
clambered in The other two men were not prepared with the oars and
the boat swept back and grounded Half a dozen times with a great
expenditure of energy this was repeated

Shorty sat down disconsolately on the gunwale took a chew of tobacco
and questioned the universe while Kit baled the boat and the other two
exchanged unkind remarks

If youll take my orders Ill get her off Sprague finally said

The attempt was well intended but before he could clamber on board he
was wet to the waist

Weve got to camp and build a fire he said as the boat grounded
again Im freezing

Dont be afraid of a wetting Stine sneered Other men have gone
off today wetter than you Now Im going to take her out

This time it was he who got the wetting and who announced with
chattering teeth the need of a fire

A little splash like that Sprague chattered spitefully Well go
on

Shorty dig out my clothesbag and make a fire the other commanded

Youll do nothing of the sort Sprague cried

Shorty looked from one to the other expectorated but did not move

Hes working for me and I guess he obeys my orders Stine retorted
Shorty take that bag ashore

Shorty obeyed and Sprague shivered in the boat Kit having received
no orders remained inactive glad of the rest

A boat divided against itself wont float he soliloquized

Whats that Sprague snarled at him

Talking to myselfhabit of mine he answered

His employer favoured him with a hard look and sulked several minutes
longer Then he surrendered

Get out my bag Smoke he ordered and lend a hand with that fire
We wont get off till the morning now



II

Next day the gale still blew Lake Linderman was no more than a narrow
mountain gorge filled with water Sweeping down from the mountains
through this funnel the wind was irregular blowing great guns at
times and at other times dwindling to a strong breeze

If you give me a shot at it I think I can get her off Kit said
when all was ready for the start

What do you know about it Stine snapped at him

Search me Kit answered and subsided

It was the first time he had worked for wages in his life but he was
learning the discipline of it fast Obediently and cheerfully he
joined in various vain efforts to get clear of the beach

How would you go about it Sprague finally halfpanted halfwhined
at him

Sit down and get a good rest till a lull comes in the wind and then
buck in for all were worth

Simple as the idea was he had been the first to evolve it the first
time it was applied it worked and they hoisted a blanket to the mast
and sped down the lake Stine and Sprague immediately became cheerful
Shorty despite his chronic pessimism was always cheerful and Kit was
too interested to be otherwise Sprague struggled with the steering
sweep for a quarter of an hour and then looked appealingly at Kit who
relieved him

My arms are fairly broken with the strain of it Sprague muttered
apologetically

You never ate bearmeat did you Kit asked sympathetically

What the devil do you mean

Oh nothing I was just wondering

But behind his employers back Kit caught the approving grin of Shorty
who had already caught the whim of his simile

Kit steered the length of Linderman displaying an aptitude that caused
both young men of money and disinclination for work to name him
boatsteerer Shorty was no less pleased and volunteered to continue
cooking and leave the boat work to the other

Between Linderman and Lake Bennet was a portage The boat lightly
loaded was lined down the small but violent connecting stream and
here Kit learned a vast deal more about boats and water But when it
came to packing the outfit Stine and Sprague disappeared and their
men spent two days of backbreaking toil in getting the outfit across
And this was the history of many miserable days of the tripKit and
Shorty working to exhaustion while their masters toiled not and
demanded to be waited upon

But the ironbound arctic winter continued to close down and they were
held back by numerous and avoidable delays At Windy Arm Stine
arbitrarily dispossessed Kit of the steeringsweep and within the hour
wrecked the boat on a wavebeaten lee shore Two days were lost here
in making repairs and the morning of the fresh start as they came
down to embark on stern and bow in large letters was charcoaled The
Chechaquo

Kit grinned at the appropriateness of the invidious word

Huh said Shorty when accused by Stine I can sure read and spell
an I know that Chechaquo means tenderfoot but my education never went
high enough to learn me to spell a jawbreaker like that

Both employers looked daggers at Kit for the insult rankled nor did
he mention that the night before Shorty had besought him for the
spelling of that particular word

Thats most as bad as your bearmeat slam at em Shorty confided
later

Kit chuckled Along with the continuous discovery of his own powers
had come an everincreasing disapproval of the two masters It was not
so much irritation which was always present as disgust He had got
his taste of the meat and liked it but they were teaching him how not
to eat it Privily he thanked God that he was not made as they He
came to dislike them to a degree that bordered on hatred Their
malingering bothered him less than their helpless inefficiency
Somewhere in him old Isaac Bellew and all the rest of the hardy
Bellews were making good

Shorty he said one day in the usual delay of getting started I
could almost fetch them a rap over the head with an oar and bury them
in the river

Same here Shorty agreed Theyre not meateaters Theyre
fisheaters and they sure stink



III

They came to the rapids first the Box Canyon and several miles
below the White Horse The Box Canyon was adequately named It was a
box a trap Once in it the only way out was through On either side
arose perpendicular walls of rock The river narrowed to a fraction of
its width and roared through this gloomy passage in a madness of
motion that heaped the water in the centre into a ridge fully eight
feet higher than at the rocky sides This ridge in turn was crested
with stiff upstanding waves that curled over yet remained each in its
unvarying place The Canyon was well feared for it had collected its
toll of dead from the passing goldrushers

Tying to the bank above where lay a score of other anxious boats Kit
and his companions went ahead on foot to investigate They crept to
the brink and gazed down at the swirl of water Sprague drew back
shuddering

My God he exclaimed A swimmer hasnt a chance in that

Shorty touched Kit significantly with his elbow and said in an
undertone

Cold feet Dollars to doughnuts they dont go through

Kit scarcely heard From the beginning of the boat trip he had been
learning the stubbornness and inconceivable viciousness of the
elements and this glimpse of what was below him acted as a challenge

Weve got to ride that ridge he said If we get off of it well
hit the walls

And never know what hit us was Shortys verdict Can you swim
Smoke

Id wish I couldnt if anything went wrong in there

Thats what I say a stranger standing alongside and peering down
into the Canyon said mournfully And I wish I were through it

I wouldnt sell my chance to go through Kit answered

He spoke honestly but it was with the idea of heartening the man He
turned to go back to the boat

Are you going to tackle it the man asked

Kit nodded

I wish I could get the courage to the other confessed Ive been
here for hours The longer I look the more afraid I am I am not a
boatman and I have only my nephew with me who is a young boy and my
wife If you get through safely will you run my boat through

Kit looked at Shorty who delayed to answer

Hes got his wife with him Kit suggested Nor had he mistaken his
man

Sure Shorty affirmed It was just that I was stopping to think
about I knew there was some reason I ought to do it

Again they turned to go but Sprague and Stine made no movement

Good luck Smoke Sprague called to him Iller He hesitated
Ill just stay here and watch you

We need three men in the boat two at the oars and one at the steering
sweep Kit said quietly

Sprague looked at Stine

Im damned if I do said that gentleman If youre not afraid to
stand here and look on Im not

Whos afraid Sprague demanded hotly

Stine retorted in kind and their two men left them in the thick of a
squabble

We can do without them Kit said to Shorty You take the bow with a
paddle and Ill handle the steering sweep All youll have to do is
just to keep her straight Once were started you wont be able to
hear me so just keep on keeping straight

They cast off the boat and worked out to middle in the quickening
current From the Canyon came an evergrowing roar The river sucked
in to the entrance with the smoothness of molten glass and here as
the darkening walls received them Shorty took a chew of tobacco and
dipped his paddle The boat leaped on the first crests of the ridge
and they were deafened by the uproar of wild water that reverberated
from the narrow walls and multiplied itself They were halfsmothered
with flying spray At times Kit could not see his comrade at the bow
It was only a matter of two minutes in which time they rode the ridge
threequarters of a mile and emerged in safety and tied to the bank in
the eddy below

Shorty emptied his mouth of tobacco juicehe had forgotten to
spitand spoke

That was bearmeat he exulted the real bearmeat Say we want a
few didnt we Smoke I dont mind tellin you in confidence that
before we started I was the goshdangdest scaredest man this side of
the RockyMountains Now Im a beareater Come on an well run that
other boat through

Midway back on foot they encountered their employers who had watched
the passage from above

There comes the fisheaters said Shorty Keep to winward



IV

After running the strangers boat through whose name proved to be
Breck Kit and Shorty met his wife a slender girlish woman whose blue
eyes were moist with gratitude Breck himself tried to hand Kit fifty
dollars and then attempted it on Shorty

Stranger was the latters rejection I come into this country to
make money outa the ground an not outa my fellow critters

Breck rummaged in his boat and produced a demijohn of whiskey Shortys
hand half went out to it and stopped abruptly He shook his head

Theres that blamed White Horse right below an they say its worse
than the Box I reckon I dont dast tackle any lightning

Several miles below they ran in to the bank and all four walked down
to look at the bad water The river which was a succession of rapids
was here deflected toward the right bank by a rocky reef The whole
body of water rushing crookedly into the narrow passage accelerated
its speed frightfully and was upflung unto huge waves white and
wrathful This was the dread Mane of the White Horse and here an even
heavier toll of dead had been exacted On one side of the Mane was a
corkscrew curlover and suckunder and on the opposite side was the
big whirlpool To go through the Mane itself must be ridden

This plum rips the strings outa the Box Shorty concluded

As they watched a boat took the head of the rapids above It was a
large boat fully thirty feet long laden with several tons of outfit
and handled by six men Before it reached the Mane it was plunging and
leaping at times almost hidden by the foam and spray

Shorty shot a slow sidelong glance at Kit and said

Shes fair smoking and she hasnt hit the worst Theyve hauled the
oars in There she takes it now God Shes gone No there she is

Big as the boat was it had been buried from sight in the flying
smother between crests The next moment in the thick of the Mane the
boat leaped up a crest and into view To Kits amazement he saw the
whole long bottom clearly outlined The boat for the fraction of an
instant was in the air the men sitting idly in their places all save
one in the stern who stood at the steering sweep Then came the
downward plunge into the trough and a second disappearance Three times
the boat leaped and buried itself then those on the bank saw its nose
take the whirlpool as it slipped off the Mane The steersman vainly
opposing with his full weight on the steeringgear surrendered to the
whirlpool and helped the boat to take the circle

Three times it went around each time so close to the rocks on which
Kit and Shorty stood that either could have leaped on board The
steersman a man with a reddish beard of recent growth waved his hand
to them The only way out of the whirlpool was by the Mane and on the
round the boat entered the Mane obliquely at its upper end Possibly
out of fear of the draw of the whirlpool the steersman did not attempt
to straighten out quickly enough When he did it was too late
Alternately in the air and buried the boat angled the Mane and sucked
into and down through the stiff wall of the corkscrew on the opposite
side of the river A hundred feet below boxes and bales began to
float up Then appeared the bottom of the boat and the scattered heads
of six men Two managed to make the bank in the eddy below The
others were drawn under and the general flotsam was lost to view
borne on by the swift current around the bend

There was a long minute of silence Shorty was the first to speak

Come on he said We might as well tackle it My feetll get cold
if I stay here any longer

Well smoke some Kit grinned at him

And youll sure earn your name was the rejoinder Shorty turned to
their employers Comin he queried

Perhaps the roar of the water prevented them from hearing the
invitation

Shorty and Kit tramped back through a foot of snow to the head of the
rapids and cast off the boat Kit was divided between two impressions
one of the caliber of his comrade which served as a spur to him the
other likewise a spur was the knowledge that old Isaac Bellew and
all the other Bellews had done things like this in their westward
march of empire What they had done he could do It was the meat the
strong meat and he knew as never before that it required strong men
to eat such meat

Youve sure got to keep the top of the ridge Shorty shouted at him
the plug tobacco lifting to his mouth as the boat quickened in the
quickening current and took the head of the rapids

Kit nodded swayed his strength and weight tentatively on the steering
oar and headed the boat for the plunge

Several minutes later halfswamped and lying against the bank in the
eddy below the White Horse Shorty spat out a mouthful of tobacco juice
and shook Kits hand

Meat Meat Shorty chanted We eat it raw We eat it alive

At the top of the bank they met Breck His wife stood at a little
distance Kit shook his hand

Im afraid your boat cant make it he said It is smaller than
ours and a bit cranky

The man pulled out a row of bills

Ill give you each a hundred if you run it through

Kit looked out and up the tossing Mane of the White Horse A long
gray twilight was falling it was turning colder and the landscape
seemed taking on a savage bleakness

It aint that Shorty was saying We dont want your money
Wouldnt touch it nohow But my pardner is the real meat with boats
and when he says yourn aint safe I reckon he knows what hes talkin
about

Kit nodded affirmation and chanced to glance at Mrs Breck Her eyes
were fixed upon him and he knew that if ever he had seen prayer in a
womans eyes he was seeing it then Shorty followed his gaze and saw
what he saw They looked at each other in confusion and did not speak
Moved by the common impulse they nodded to each other and turned to
the trail that led to the head of the rapids They had not gone a
hundred yards when they met Stine and Sprague coming down

Where are you going the latter demanded

To fetch that other boat through Shorty answered

No youre not Its getting dark You two are going to pitch camp

So huge was Kits disgust that he forebore to speak

Hes got his wife with him Shorty said

Thats his lookout Stine contributed

And Smokes and mine was Shortys retort

I forbid you Sprague said harshly Smoke if you go another step
Ill discharge you

And you too Shorty Stine added

And a hell of a pickle youll be in with us fired Shorty replied
Howll you get your blamed boat to Dawson Wholl serve you coffee in
your blankets and manicure your fingernails Come on Smoke They
dont dast fire us Besides weve got agreements It they fire us
theyve got to divvy up grub to last us through the winter

Barely had they shoved Brecks boat out from the bank and caught the
first rough water when the waves began to lap aboard They were small
waves but it was an earnest of what was to come Shorty cast back a
quizzical glance as he gnawed at his inevitable plug and Kit felt a
strange rush of warmth at his heart for this man who couldnt swim and
who couldnt back out

The rapids grew stiffer and the spray began to fly In the gathering
darkness Kit glimpsed the Mane and the crooked fling of the current
into it He worked into this crooked current and felt a glow of
satisfaction as the boat hit the head of the Mane squarely in the
middle After that in the smother leaping and burying and swamping
he had no clear impression of anything save that he swung his weight on
the steering oar and wished his uncle were there to see They emerged
breathless wet through and filled with water almost to the gunwale
Lighter pieces of baggage and outfit were floating inside the boat A
few careful strokes on Shortys part worked the boat into the draw of
the eddy and the eddy did the rest till the boat softly touched
against the bank Looking down from above was Mrs Breck Her prayer
had been answered and the tears were streaming down her cheeks

You boys have simply got to take the money Breck called down to them

Shorty stood up slipped and sat down in the water while the boat
dipped one gunwale under and righted again

Damn the money said Shorty Fetch out that whiskey Now that its
over Im getting cold feet an Im sure likely to have a chill



V

In the morning as usual they were among the last of the boats to
start Breck despite his boating inefficiency and with only his wife
and nephew for crew had broken camp loaded his boat and pulled out
at the first streak of day But there was no hurry in Stine and
Sprague who seemed incapable of realizing that the freezeup might
come at any time They malingered got in the way delayed and
doubted the work of Kit and Shorty

Im sure losing my respect for God seein as he must amade them two
mistakes in human form was the latters blasphemous way of expressing
his disgust

Well youre the real goods at any rate Kit grinned back at him It
makes me respect God the more just to look at you

He was sure goin some eh was Shortys fashion of overcoming the
embarrassment of the compliment

The trail by water crossed Lake Le Barge Here was no fast current
but a tideless stretch of forty miles which must be rowed unless a fair
wind blew But the time for fair wind was past and an icy gale blew
in their teeth out of the north This made a rough sea against which
it was almost impossible to pull the boat Added to their troubles was
driving snow also the freezing of the water on their oarblades kept
one man occupied in chopping it off with a hatchet Compelled to take
their turn at the oars Sprague and Stine patently loafed Kit had
learned how to throw his weight on an oar but he noted that his
employers made a seeming of throwing their weights and that they dipped
their oars at a cheating angle

At the end of three hours Sprague pulled his oar in and said they
would run back into the mouth of the river for shelter Stine seconded
him and the several hardwon miles were lost A second day and a
third the same fruitless attempt was made In the river mouth the
continually arriving boats from White Horse made a flotilla of over two
hundred Each day forty or fifty arrived and only two or three won to
the northwest short of the lake and did not come back Ice was now
forming in the eddies and connecting from eddy to eddy in thin lines
around the points The freezeup was very imminent

We could make it if they had the souls of clams Kit told Shorty as
they dried their moccasins by the fire on the evening of the third day
We could have made it today if they hadnt turned back Another
hours work would have fetched that west shore Theyretheyre babes
in the woods

Sure Shorty agreed He turned his moccasin to the flame and debated
a moment Look here Smoke Its hundreds of miles to Dawson If we
dont want to freeze in here weve got to do something What dye
say

Kit looked at him and waited

Weve got the immortal cinch on them two babes Shorty expounded
They can give orders an shed mazuma but as you say theyre plum
babes If were goin to Dawson we got to take charge of this here
outfit

They looked at each other

Its a go said Kit as his hand went out in ratification

In the morning long before daylight Shorty issued his call

Come on he roared Tumble out you sleepers Heres your coffee
Kick in to it Were goin to make a start

Grumbling and complaining Stine and Sprague were forced to get under
way two hours earlier than ever before If anything the gale was
stiffer and in a short time every mans face was iced up while the
oars were heavy with ice Three hours they struggled and four one
man steering one chopping ice two toiling at the oars and each
taking his various turns The northwest shore loomed nearer and
nearer The gale blew even harder and at last Sprague pulled in his
oar in token of surrender Shorty sprang to it though his relief had
only begun

Chop ice he said handing Sprague the hatchet

But whats the use the other whined We cant make it Were
going to turn back

Were going on said Shorty Chop ice An when you feel better
you can spell me

It was heartbreaking toil but they gained the shore only to find it
composed of surgebeaten rocks and cliffs with no place to land

I told you so Sprague whimpered

You never peeped Shorty answered

Were going back

Nobody spoke and Kit held the boat into the seas as they skirted the
forbidding shore Sometimes they gained no more than a foot to the
stroke and there were times when two or three strokes no more than
enabled them to hold their own He did his best to hearten the two
weaklings He pointed out that the boats which had won to this shore
had never come back Perforce he argued they had found a shelter
somewhere ahead Another hour they laboured and a second

If you fellows put into your oars some of that coffee you swig in your
blankets wed make it was Shortys encouragement Youre just
goin through the motions an not pullin a pound

A few minutes later Sprague drew in his oar

Im finished he said and there were tears in his voice

So are the rest of us Kit answered himself ready to cry or to
commit murder so great was his exhaustion But were going on just
the same

Were going back Turn the boat around

Shorty if he wont pull take that oar yourself Kit commanded

Sure was the answer He can chop ice

But Sprague refused to give over the oar Stine had ceased rowing and
the boat was drifting backward

Turn around Smoke Sprague ordered

And Kit who never in his life had cursed any man astonished himself

Ill see you in hell first he replied Take hold of that oar and
pull

It is in moments of exhaustion that men lose all their reserves of
civilization and such a moment had come Each man had reached the
breakingpoint Sprague jerked off a mitten drew his revolver and
turned it on his steersman This was a new experience to Kit He had
never had a gun presented at him in his life And now to his
surprise it seemed to mean nothing at all It was the most natural
thing in the world

If you dont put that gun up he said Ill take it away and rap you
over the knuckles with it

If you dont turn the boat around Ill shoot you Sprague threatened

Then Shorty took a hand He ceased chopping ice and stood up behind
Sprague

Go on an shoot said Shorty wiggling the hatchet Im just aching
for a chance to brain you Go on an start the festivities

This is mutiny Stine broke in You were engaged to obey orders

Shorty turned on him

Oh youll get yours as soon as I finish with your pardner you little
hogwallopin snooper you

Sprague Kit said Ill give you just thirty seconds to put away
that gun and get that oar out

Sprague hesitated gave a short hysterical laugh put the revolver away
and bent his back to the work

For two hours more inch by inch they fought their way along the edge
of the foaming rocks until Kit feared he had made a mistake And then
when on the verge of himself turning back they came abreast of a
narrow opening not twenty feet wide which led into a landlocked
inclosure where the fiercest gusts scarcely flawed the surface It was
the haven gained by the boats of previous days They landed on a
shelving beach and the two employers lay in collapse in the boat
while Kit and Shorty pitched the tent built a fire and started the
cooking

Whats a hogwalloping snooper Shorty Kit asked

Blamed if I know was the answer but hes one just the same

The gale which had been dying quickly ceased at nightfall and it
came on clear and cold A cup of coffee set aside to cool and
forgotten a few minutes later was found coated with half an inch of
ice At eight oclock when Sprague and Stine already rolled in their
blankets were sleeping the sleep of exhaustion Kit came back from a
look at the boat

Its the freezeup Shorty he announced Theres a skin of ice
over the whole pond already

What are you going to do

Theres only one thing The lake of course freezes first The rapid
current of the river may keep it open for days This time tomorrow
any boat caught in Lake Le Barge remains there until next year

You mean we got to get out tonight Now

Kit nodded

Tumble out you sleepers was Shortys answer couched in a roar as
he began casting off the guyropes of the tent

The other two awoke groaning with the pain of stiffened muscles and
the pain of rousing from exhausted sleep

What time is it Stine asked

Halfpast eight

Its dark yet was the objection

Shorty jerked out a couple of guyropes and the tent began to sag

Its not morning he said Its evening Come on The lakes
freezin We got to get acrost

Stine sat up his face bitter and wrathful

Let it freeze Were not going to stir

All right said Shorty Were goin on with the boat

You were engaged

To take you to Dawson Shorty caught him up Well were takin
you aint we

He punctuated his query by bringing half the tent down on top of them

They broke their way through the thin ice in the little harbour and
came out on the lake where the water heavy and glassy froze on their
oars with every stroke The water soon became like mush clogging the
stroke of the oars and freezing in the air even as it dripped Later
the surface began to form a skin and the boat proceeded slower and
slower

Often afterwards when Kit tried to remember that night and failed to
bring up aught but nightmare recollections he wondered what must have
been the sufferings of Stine and Sprague His one impression of
himself was that he struggled through biting frost and intolerable
exertion for a thousand years more or less

Morning found them stationary Stine complained of frosted fingers
and Sprague of his nose while the pain in Kits cheeks and nose told
him that he too had been touched With each accretion of daylight
they could see farther and far as they could see was icy surface The
water of the lake was gone A hundred yards away was the shore of the
north end Shorty insisted that it was the opening of the river and
that he could see water He and Kit alone were able to work and with
their oars they broke the ice and forced the boat along And at the
last gasp of their strength they made the suck of the rapid river One
look back showed them several boats which had fought through the night
and were hopelessly frozen in then they whirled around a bend in a
current running six miles an hour



VI

Day by day they floated down the swift river and day by day the
shoreice extended farther out When they made camp at nightfall they
chopped a space in the ice in which to lay the boat and carried the
camp outfit hundreds of feet to shore In the morning they chopped
the boat out through the new ice and caught the current Shorty set up
the sheetiron stove in the boat and over this Stine and Sprague hung
through the long drifting hours They had surrendered no longer gave
orders and their one desire was to gain Dawson Shorty pessimistic
indefatigable and joyous at frequent intervals roared out the three
lines of the first fourline stanza of a song he had forgotten The
colder it got the oftener he sang

 Like Argus of the ancient times
 We leave this Modern Greece
 Tumtum tumtum tumtum tumtum
 To shear the Golden Fleece

As they passed the mouths of the Hootalinqua and the Big and Little
Salmon they found these streams throwing mushice into the main Yukon
This gathered about the boat and attached itself and at night they
found themselves compelled to chop the boat out of the current In the
morning they chopped the boat back into the current

The last night ashore was spent between the mouths of the White River
and the Stewart At daylight they found the Yukon half a mile wide
running white from icerimmed bank to icerimmed bank Shorty cursed
the universe with less geniality than usual and looked at Kit

Well be the last boat this year to make Dawson Kit said

But they aint no water Smoke

Then well ride the ice down Come on

Futilely protesting Sprague and Stine were bundled on board For half
an hour with axes Kit and Shorty struggled to cut a way into the
swift but solid stream When they did succeed in clearing the
shoreice the floating ice forced the boat along the edge for a
hundred yards tearing away half of one gunwale and making a partial
wreck of it Then they caught the current at the lower end of the bend
that flung offshore They proceeded to work farther toward the
middle The stream was no longer composed of mushice but of hard
cakes In between the cakes only was mushice that froze solidly as
they looked at it Shoving with the oars against the cakes sometimes
climbing out on the cakes in order to force the boat along after an
hour they gained the middle Five minutes after they ceased their
exertions the boat was frozen in The whole river was coagulating as
it ran Cake froze to cake until at last the boat was the centre of a
cake seventyfive feet in diameter Sometimes they floated sidewise
sometimes sternfirst while gravity tore asunder the forming fetters
in the moving mass only to be manacled by fasterforming ones While
the hours passed Shorty stoked the stove cooked meals and chanted
his war song

Night came and after many efforts they gave up the attempt to force
the boat to shore and through the darkness they swept helplessly
onward

What if we pass Dawson Shorty queried

Well walk back Kit answered if were not crushed in a jam

The sky was clear and in the light of the cold leaping stars they
caught occasional glimpses of the loom of mountains on either hand At
eleven oclock from below came a dull grinding roar Their speed
began to diminish and cakes of ice to upend and crash and smash about
them The river was jamming One cake forced upward slid across
their cake and carried one side of the boat away It did not sink for
its own cake still upbore it but in a whirl they saw dark water show
for an instant within a foot of them Then all movement ceased At
the end of half an hour the whole river picked itself up and began to
move This continued for an hour when again it was brought to rest by
a jam Once again it started running swiftly and savagely with a
great grinding Then they saw lights ashore and when abreast
gravity and the Yukon surrendered and the river ceased for six months

On the shore at Dawson curious ones gathered to watch the river
freeze heard from out of the darkness the warsong of Shorty

 Like Argus of the ancient times
 We leave this Modern Greece
 Tumtum tumtum tumtum tumtum
 To shear the Golden Fleece



VII

For three days Kit and Shorty laboured carrying the ton and a half of
outfit from the middle of the river to the logcabin Stine and Sprague
had bought on the hill overlooking Dawson This work finished in the
warm cabin as twilight was falling Sprague motioned Kit to him
Outside the thermometer registered sixtyfive below zero

Your full month isnt up Smoke Sprague said But here it is in
full I wish you luck

How about the agreement Kit asked You know theres a famine here
A man cant get work in the mines even unless he has his own grub
You agreed

I know of no agreement Sprague interrupted Do you Stine We
engaged you by the month Theres your pay Will you sign the
receipt

Kits hands clenched and for the moment he saw red Both men shrank
away from him He had never struck a man in anger in his life and he
felt so certain of his ability to thrash Sprague that he could not
bring himself to do it

Shorty saw his trouble and interposed

Look here Smoke I aint travelin no more with a ornery outfit like
this Right heres where I sure jump it You an me stick together
Savve Now you take your blankets an hike down to the Elkhorn Wait
for me Ill settle up collect whats comin an give them whats
comin I aint no good on the water but my feets on terryfermy now
an Im sure goin to make smoke

     

Half an hour afterwards Shorty appeared at the Elkhorn From his
bleeding knuckles and the skin off one cheek it was evident that he
had given Stine and Sprague what was coming

You ought to see that cabin he chuckled as they stood at the bar
Roughhouse aint no name for it Dollars to doughnuts nary one of
em shows up on the street for a week An now its all figgered out
for you an me Grubs a dollar an a half a pound They aint no work
for wages without you have your own grub Moosemeats sellin for two
dollars a pound an they aint none We got enough money for a months
grub an ammunition an we hike up the Klondike to the back country
If they aint no moose we go an live with the Indians But if we
aint got five thousand pounds of meat six weeks from now IllIll
sure go back an apologize to our bosses Is it a go

Kits hand went out and they shook Then he faltered

I dont know anything about hunting he said

Shorty lifted his glass

But youre a sure meateater an Ill learn you




THE STAMPEDE TO SQUAW CREEK




I

Two months after Smoke Bellew and Shorty went after moose for a
grubstake they were back in the Elkhorn saloon at Dawson The hunting
was done the meat hauled in and sold for two dollars and a half a
pound and between them they possessed three thousand dollars in gold
dust and a good team of dogs They had played in luck Despite the
fact that the gold rush had driven the game a hundred miles or more
into the mountains they had within half that distance bagged four
moose in a narrow canyon

The mystery of the strayed animals was no greater than the luck of
their killers for within the day four famished Indian families
reporting no game in three days journey back camped beside them Meat
was traded for starving dogs and after a week of feeding Smoke and
Shorty harnessed the animals and began freighting the meat to the eager
Dawson market

The problem of the two men now was to turn their golddust into food
The current price for flour and beans was a dollar and a half a pound
but the difficulty was to find a seller Dawson was in the throes of
famine Hundreds of men with money but no food had been compelled to
leave the country Many had gone down the river on the last water and
many more with barely enough food to last had walked the six hundred
miles over the ice to Dyea

Smoke met Shorty in the warm saloon and found the latter jubilant

Life aint no punkins without whiskey an sweetenin was Shortys
greeting as he pulled lumps of ice from his thawing moustache and
flung them rattling on the floor An I sure just got eighteen pounds
of that same sweetenin The geezer only charged three dollars a pound
for it What luck did you have

I too have not been idle Smoke answered with pride I bought
fifty pounds of flour And theres a man up on Adam Creek says hell
let me have fifty pounds more tomorrow

Great Well sure live till the river opens Say Smoke them dogs
of ourn is the goods A dogbuyer offered me two hundred apiece for
the five of them I told him nothin doin They sure took on class
when they got meat to get outside of but it goes against the grain
feedin dogcritters on grub thats worth two and a half a pound Come
on an have a drink I just got to celebrate them eighteen pounds of
sweetenin

Several minutes later as he weighed in on the goldscales for the
drinks he gave a start of recollection

I plum forgot that man I was to meet in the Tivoli Hes got some
spoiled bacon hell sell for a dollar an a half a pound We can feed
it to the dogs an save a dollar a day on eachs board bill So long

So long said Smoke Im goin to the cabin an turn in

Hardly had Shorty left the place when a furclad man entered through
the double stormdoors His face lighted at sight of Smoke who
recognized him as Breck the man whose boat he had run through the Box
Canyon and White Horse rapids

I heard you were in town Breck said hurriedly as they shook hands
Been looking for you for half an hour Come outside I want to talk
with you

Smoke looked regretfully at the roaring redhot stove

Wont this do

No its important Come outside

As they emerged Smoke drew off one mitten lighted a match and
glanced at the thermometer that hung beside the door He remittened
his naked hand hastily as if the frost had burnt him Overhead arched
the flaming aurora borealis while from all Dawson arose the mournful
howling of thousands of wolfdogs

What did it say Breck asked

Sixty below Kit spat experimentally and the spittle crackled in
the air And the thermometer is certainly working Its falling all
the time An hour ago it was only fiftytwo Dont tell me its a
stampede

It is Breck whispered back cautiously casting anxious eyes about in
fear of some other listener You know Squaw Creekempties in on the
other side the Yukon thirty miles up

Nothing doing there was Smokes judgment It was prospected years
ago

So were all the other rich creeks Listen Its big Only eight to
twenty feet to bedrock There wont be a claim that dont run to half
a million Its a dead secret Two or three of my close friends let
me in on it I told my wife right away that I was going to find you
before I started Now so long My packs hidden down the bank In
fact when they told me they made me promise not to pull out until
Dawson was asleep You know what it means if youre seen with a
stampeding outfit Get your partner and follow You ought to stake
fourth or fifth claim from Discovery Dont forgetSquaw Creek Its
the third after you pass Swede Creek



II

When Smoke entered the little cabin on the hillside back of Dawson he
heard a heavy familiar breathing

Aw go to bed Shorty mumbled as Smoke shook his shoulder Im not
on the night shift was his next remark as the rousing hand became
more vigorous Tell your troubles to the barkeeper

Kick into your clothes Smoke said Weve got to stake a couple of
claims

Shorty sat up and started to explode but Smokes hand covered his
mouth

Ssh Smoke warned Its a big strike Dont wake the
neighbourhood Dawsons asleep

Huh You got to show me Nobody tells anybody about a strike of
course not But aint it plum amazin the way everybody hits the trail
just the same

Squaw Creek Smoke whispered Its right Breck gave me the tip
Shallow bedrock Gold from the grassroots down Come on Well sling
a couple of light packs together and pull out

Shortys eyes closed as he lapsed back into sleep The next moment his
blankets were swept off him

If you dont want them I do Smoke explained

Shorty followed the blankets and began to dress

Goin to take the dogs he asked

No The trail up the creek is sure to be unbroken and we can make
better time without them

Then Ill throw em a meal whichll have to last em till we get
back Be sure you take some birchbark and a candle

Shorty opened the door felt the bite of the cold and shrank back to
pull down his earflaps and mitten his hands

Five minutes later he returned sharply rubbing his nose

Smoke Im sure opposed to makin this stampede Its colder than the
hinges of hell a thousand years before the first fire was lighted
Besides its Friday the thirteenth an were goin to trouble as the
sparks fly upward

With small stampeding packs on their backs they closed the door behind
them and started down the hill The display of the aurora borealis had
ceased and only the stars leaped in the great cold and by their
uncertain light made traps for the feet Shorty floundered off a turn
of the trail into deep snow and raised his voice in blessing of the
date of the week and month and year

Cant you keep still Smoke chided Leave the almanac alone Youll
have all Dawson awake and after us

Huh See the light in that cabin And in that one over there An
hear that door slam Oh sure Dawsons asleep Them lights Just
buryin their dead They aint stampedin betcher life they aint

By the time they reached the foot of the hill and were fairly in
Dawson lights were springing up in the cabins doors were slamming
and from behind came the sound of many moccasins on the hardpacked
snow Again Shorty delivered himself

But it beats hell the amount of mourners there is

They passed a man who stood by the path and was calling anxiously in a
low voice Oh Charley get a move on

See that pack on his back Smoke The graveyards sure a long ways
off when the mourners got to pack their blankets

By the time they reached the main street a hundred men were in line
behind them and while they sought in the deceptive starlight for the
trail that dipped down the bank to the river more men could be heard
arriving Shorty slipped and shot down the thirtyfoot chute into the
soft snow Smoke followed knocking him over as he was rising to his
feet

I found it first he gurgled taking off his mittens to shake the
snow out of the gauntlets

The next moment they were scrambling wildly out of the way of the
hurtling bodies of those that followed At the time of the freezeup
a jam had occurred at this point and cakes of ice were upended in
snowcovered confusion After several hard falls Smoke drew out his
candle and lighted it Those in the rear hailed it with acclaim In
the windless air it burned easily and he led the way more quickly

Its a sure stampede Shorty decided Or might all them be
sleepwalkers

Were at the head of the procession at any rate was Smokes answer

Oh I dont know Mebbe thats a firefly ahead there Mebbe theyre
all firefliesthat one an that one Look at em Believe me they
is whole strings of processions ahead

It was a mile across the jams to the west bank of the Yukon and
candles flickered the full length of the twisting trail Behind them
clear to the top of the bank they had descended were more candles

Say Smoke this aint no stampede Its a exodeus They must be a
thousand men ahead of us an ten thousand behind Now you listen to
your uncle My medicines good When I get a hunch its sure right
An were in wrong on this stampede Lets turn back an hit the
sleep

Youd better save your breath if you intend to keep up Smoke
retorted gruffly

Huh My legs is short but I slog along slack at the knees an dont
worry my muscles none an I can sure walk every piker here off the
ice

And Smoke knew he was right for he had long since learned his
comrades phenomenal walking powers

Ive been holding back to give you a chance Smoke jeered

An Im plum troddin on your heels If you cant do better let me
go ahead and set pace

Smoke quickened and was soon at the rear of the nearest bunch of
stampeders

Hike along you Smoke the other urged Walk over them unburied
dead This aint no funeral Hit the frost like you was goin
somewheres

Smoke counted eight men and two women in this party and before the way
across the jamice was won he and Shorty had passed another party
twenty strong Within a few feet of the west bank the trail swerved
to the south emerging from the jam upon smooth ice The ice however
was buried under several feet of fine snow Through this the
sledtrail ran a narrow ribbon of packed footing barely two feet in
width On either side one sank to his knees and deeper in the snow
The stampeders they overtook were reluctant to give way and often
Smoke and Shorty had to plunge into the deep snow and by supreme
efforts flounder past

Shorty was irrepressible and pessimistic When the stampeders resented
being passed he retorted in kind

Whats your hurry one of them asked

Whats yours he answered A stampede come down from Indian River
yesterday afternoon an beat you to it They aint no claims left

That being so I repeat whats your hurry

WHO Me I aint no stampeder Im workin for the government Im
on official business Im just traipsin along to take the census of
Squaw Creek

To another who hailed him with Where away little one Do you
really expect to stake a claim Shorty answered

Me Im the discoverer of Squaw Creek Im just comin back from
recordin so as to see no blamed chechaquo jumps my claim

The average pace of the stampeders on the smooth going was three miles
and a half an hour Smoke and Shorty were doing four and a half
though sometimes they broke into short runs and went faster

Im going to travel your feet clean off Shorty Smoke challenged

Huh I can hike along on the stumps an wear the heels off your
moccasins Though it aint no use Ive ben figgerin Creek claims
is five hundred feet Call em ten to the mile Theys a thousand
stampeders ahead of us an that creek aint no hundred miles long
Somebodys goin to get left an it makes a noise like you an me

Before replying Smoke let out an unexpected link that threw Shorty
half a dozen feet in the rear

If you saved your breath and kept up wed cut down a few of that
thousand he chided

Who Me If yous get outa the way Id show you a pace what is

Smoke laughed and let out another link The whole aspect of the
adventure had changed Through his brain was running a phrase of the
mad philosopherthe transvaluation of values In truth he was
less interested in staking a fortune than in beating Shorty After all
he concluded it wasnt the reward of the game but the playing of it
that counted Mind and muscle and stamina and soul were challenged
in a contest with this Shorty a man who had never opened the books
and who did not know grand opera from ragtime nor an epic from a
chilblain

Shorty Ive got you skinned to death Ive reconstructed every cell
in my body since I hit the beach at Dyea My flesh is as stringy as
whipcords and as bitter and mean as the bite of a rattlesnake A few
months ago Id have patted myself on the back to write such words but
I couldnt have written them I had to live them first and now that
Im living them theres no need to write them Im the real bitter
stinging goods and no scrub of a mountaineer can put anything over on
me without getting it back compound Now you go ahead and set pace
for half an hour Do your worst and when youre all in Ill go ahead
and give you half an hour of the real worst

Huh Shorty sneered genially An him not dry behind the ears yet
Get outa the way an let your father show you some goin

Halfhour by halfhour they alternated in setting pace Nor did they
talk much Their exertions kept them warm though their breath froze
on their faces from lips to chin So intense was the cold that they
almost continually rubbed their noses and cheeks with their mittens A
few minutes cessation from this allowed the flesh to grow numb and
then most vigorous rubbing was required to produce the burning prickle
of returning circulation

Often they thought they had reached the lead but always they overtook
more stampeders who had started before them Occasionally groups of
men attempted to swing in behind to their pace but invariably they
were discouraged after a mile or two and disappeared in the darkness
to the rear

Weve been out on trail all winter was Shortys comment An them
geezers soft from laying around their cabins has the nerve to think
they can keep our stride Now if they was real sourdoughs itd be
different If theres one thing a sourdough can do its sure walk

Once Smoke lighted a match and glanced at his watch He never
repeated it for so quick was the bite of the frost on his bared hands
that half an hour passed before they were again comfortable

Four oclock he said as he pulled on his mittens and weve
already passed three hundred

Three hundred and thirtyeight Shorty corrected I ben keepin
count Get outa the way stranger Let somebody stampede that knows
how to stampede

The latter was addressed to a man evidently exhausted who could no
more than stumble along and who blocked the trail This and one
other were the only playedout men they encountered for they were
very near to the head of the stampede Nor did they learn till
afterwards the horrors of that night Exhausted men sat down to rest
by the way and failed to get up Seven were frozen to death while
scores of amputations of toes feet and fingers were performed in the
Dawson hospitals on the survivors For of all nights for a stampede
the one to Squaw Creek occurred on the coldest night of the year
Before morning the spirit thermometers at Dawson registered seventy
degrees below zero The men composing the stampede with few
exceptions were newcomers in the country who did not know the way of
the cold

The other playedout man they found a few minutes later revealed by a
streamer of aurora borealis that shot like a searchlight from horizon
to zenith He was sitting on a piece of ice beside the trail

Hop along sister Mary Shorty gaily greeted him Keep movin If
you sit there youll freeze stiff

The man made no response and they stopped to investigate

Stiff as a poker was Shortys verdict If you tumbled him over
hed break

See if hes breathing Smoke said as with bared hands he sought
through furs and woollens for the mans heart

Shorty lifted one earflap and bent to the iced lips

Nary breathe he reported

Nor heartbeat said Smoke

He mittened his hand and beat it violently for a minute before exposing
it to the frost to strike a match It was an old man incontestably
dead In the moment of illumination they saw a long grey beard
massed with ice to the nose cheeks that were white with frost and
closed eyes with frostrimmed lashes frozen together Then the match
went out

Come on Shorty said rubbing his ear We cant do nothing for the
old geezer An Ive sure frosted my ear Now all the blamed skinll
peel off and itll be sore for a week

A few minutes later when a flaming ribbon spilled pulsating fire over
the heavens they saw on the ice a quarter of a mile ahead two forms
Beyond for a mile nothing moved

Theyre leading the procession Smoke said as darkness fell again
Come on lets get them

At the end of half an hour not yet having overtaken the two in front
Shorty broke into a run

If we catch em well never pass em he panted Lord what a pace
theyre hittin Dollars to doughnuts theyre no chechaquos Theyre
the real sourdough variety you can stack on that

Smoke was leading when they finally caught up and he was glad to ease
to a walk at their heels Almost immediately he got the impression
that the one nearer him was a woman How this impression came he
could not tell Hooded and furred the dark form was as any form yet
there was a haunting sense of familiarity about it He waited for the
next flame of the aurora and by its light saw the smallness of the
moccasined feet But he saw morethe walk and knew it for the
unmistakable walk he had once resolved never to forget

Shes a sure goer Shorty confided hoarsely Ill bet its an

How do you do Miss Gastell Smoke addressed

How do you do she answered with a turn of the head and a quick
glance Its too dark to see Who are you

Smoke

She laughed in the frost and he was certain it was the prettiest
laughter he had ever heard

And have you married and raised all those children you were telling me
about Before he could retort she went on How many chechaquos are
there behind

Several thousand I imagine We passed over three hundred And they
werent wasting any time

Its the old story she said bitterly The newcomers get in on the
rich creeks and the oldtimers who dared and suffered and made this
country get nothing Oldtimers made this discovery on Squaw
Creekhow it leaked out is the mysteryand they sent word up to all
the oldtimers on Sea Lion But its ten miles farther than Dawson
and when they arrive theyll find the creek staked to the skyline by
the Dawson chechaquos It isnt right it isnt fair such perversity
of luck

It is too bad Smoke sympathized But Im hanged if I know what
youre going to do about it First come first served you know

I wish I could do something she flashed back at him Id like to
see them all freeze on the trail or have everything terrible happen to
them so long as the Sea Lion stampede arrived first

Youve certainly got it in for us hard he laughed

It isnt that she said quickly Man by man I know the crowd from
Sea Lion and they are men They starved in this country in the old
days and they worked like giants to develop it I went through the
hard times on the Koyokuk with them when I was a little girl And I
was with them in the Birch Creek famine and in the Forty Mile famine
They are heroes and they deserve some reward and yet here are
thousands of green softlings who havent earned the right to stake
anything miles and miles ahead of them And now if youll forgive my
tirade Ill save my breath for I dont know when you and all the rest
may try to pass dad and me

No further talk passed between Joy and Smoke for an hour or so though
he noticed that for a time she and her father talked in low tones

I knowm now Shorty told Smoke Hes old Louis Gastell an the
real goods That must be his kid He come into this country so long
ago they aint nobody can recollect an he brought the girl with him
she only a baby Him an Beetles was tradin partners an they ran the
first dinkey little steamboat up the Koyokuk

I dont think well try to pass them Smoke said Were at the head
of the stampede and there are only four of us

Shorty agreed and another hour of silence followed during which they
swung steadily along At seven oclock the blackness was broken by a
last display of the aurora borealis which showed to the west a broad
opening between snowclad mountains

Squaw Creek Joy exclaimed

Goin some Shorty exulted We oughtnt to ben there for another
half hour to the least accordin to my reckonin I must a ben
spreadin my legs

It was at this point that the Dyea trail baffled by icejams swerved
abruptly across the Yukon to the east bank And here they must leave
the hardpacked maintravelled trail mount the jams and follow a dim
trail but slightly packed that hovered the west bank

Louis Gastell leading slipped in the darkness on the rough ice and
sat up holding his ankle in both his hands He struggled to his feet
and went on but at a slower pace and with a perceptible limp After a
few minutes he abruptly halted

Its no use he said to his daughter Ive sprained a tendon You
go ahead and stake for me as well as yourself

Cant we do something Smoke asked

Louis Gastell shook his head

She can stake two claims as well as one Ill crawl over to the bank
start a fire and bandage my ankle Ill be all right Go on Joy
Stake ours above the Discovery claim its richer higher up

Heres some birch bark Smoke said dividing his supply equally
Well take care of your daughter

Louis Gastell laughed harshly

Thank you just the same he said But she can take care of herself
Follow her and watch her

Do you mind if I lead she asked Smoke as she headed on I know
this country better than you

Lead on Smoke answered gallantly though I agree with you its a
darned shame all us chechaquos are going to beat that Sea Lion bunch to
it Isnt there some way to shake them

She shook her head

We cant hide our trail and theyll follow it like sheep

After a quarter of a mile she turned sharply to the west Smoke
noticed that they were going through unpacked snow but neither he nor
Shorty observed that the dim trail they had been on still led south
Had they witnessed the subsequent procedure of Louis Gastell the
history of the Klondike would have been written differently for they
would have seen that oldtimer no longer limping running with his
nose to the trail like a hound following them Also they would have
seen him trample and widen the turn they had made to the west And
finally they would have seen him keep on the old dim trail that still
led south

A trail did run up the creek but so slight was it that they
continually lost it in the darkness After a quarter of an hour Joy
Gastell was willing to drop into the rear and let the two men take
turns in breaking a way through the snow This slowness of the leaders
enabled the whole stampede to catch up and when daylight came at nine
oclock as far back as they could see was an unbroken line of men
Joys dark eyes sparkled at the sight

How long since we started up the creek she asked

Fully two hours Smoke answered

And two hours back makes four she laughed The stampede from Sea
Lion is saved

A faint suspicion crossed Smokes mind and he stopped and confronted
her

I dont understand he said

You dont Then Ill tell you This is Norway Creek Squaw Creek is
the next to the south

Smoke was for the moment speechless

You did it on purpose Shorty demanded

I did it to give the oldtimers a chance

She laughed mockingly The men grinned at each other and finally
joined her

Id lay you across my knee an give you a wallopin if womenfolk
wasnt so scarce in this country Shorty assured her

Your father didnt sprain a tendon but waited till we were out of
sight and then went on Smoke asked

She nodded

And you were the decoy

Again she nodded and this time Smokes laughter rang out clear and
true It was the spontaneous laughter of a frankly beaten man

Why dont you get angry with me she queried ruefully Oror
wallop me

Well we might as well be starting back Shorty urged My feets
gettin cold standin here

Smoke shook his head

That would mean four hours lost We must be eight miles up this Creek
now and from the look ahead Norway is making a long swing south
Well follow it then cross over the divide somehow and tap Squaw
Creek somewhere above Discovery He looked at Joy Wont you come
along with us I told your father wed look after you

I She hesitated I think I shall if you dont mind She was
looking straight at him and her face was no longer defiant and
mocking Really Mr Smoke you make me almost sorry for what I have
done But somebody had to save the oldtimers

It strikes me that stampeding is at best a sporting proposition

And it strikes me you two are very game about it she went on then
added with the shadow of a sigh What a pity you are not oldtimers

For two hours more they kept to the frozen creekbed of Norway then
turned into a narrow and rugged tributary that flowed from the south
At midday they began the ascent of the divide itself Behind them
looking down and back they could see the long line of stampeders
breaking up Here and there in scores of places thin smokecolumns
advertised the making of camps

As for themselves the going was hard They wallowed through snow to
their waists and were compelled to stop every few yards to breathe
Shorty was the first to call a halt

We ben hittin the trail for over twelve hours he said Smoke Im
plum willin to say Im good an tired An so are you An Im free
to shout that I can sure hang on to this here pascar like a starvin
Indian to a hunk of bearmeat But this poor girl here cant keep her
legs no time if she dont get something in her stomach Heres where
we build a fire What dye say

So quickly so deftly and methodically did they go about making a
temporary camp that Joy watching with jealous eyes admitted to
herself that the oldtimers could not do it better Spruce boughs
with a spread blanket on top gave a foundation for rest and cooking
operations But they kept away from the heat of the fire until noses
and cheeks had been rubbed cruelly

Smoke spat in the air and the resultant crackle was so immediate and
loud that he shook his head

I give it up he said Ive never seen cold like this

One winter on the Koyokuk it went to eightysix below Joy answered
Its at least seventy or seventyfive right now and I know Ive
frosted my cheeks Theyre burning like fire

On the steep slope of the divide there was no ice while snow as fine
and hard and crystalline as granulated sugar was poured into the
goldpan by the bushel until enough water was melted for the coffee
Smoke fried bacon and thawed biscuits Shorty kept the fuel supplied
and tended the fire and Joy set the simple table composed of two
plates two cups two spoons a tin of mixed salt and pepper and a tin
of sugar When it came to eating she and Smoke shared one set between
them They ate out of the same plate and drank from the same cup

It was nearly two in the afternoon when they cleared the crest of the
divide and began dropping down a feeder of Squaw Creek Earlier in the
winter some moosehunter had made a trail up the canyonthat is in
going up and down he had stepped always in his previous tracks As a
result in the midst of soft snow and veiled under later snow falls
was a line of irregular hummocks If ones foot missed a hummock he
plunged down through unpacked snow and usually to a fall Also the
moosehunter had been an exceptionally longlegged individual Joy
who was eager now that the two men should stake and fearing that they
were slackening pace on account of her evident weariness insisted on
taking the lead The speed and manner in which she negotiated the
precarious footing called out Shortys unqualified approval

Look at her he cried Shes the real goods an the red meat Look
at them moccasins swing along No highheels there She uses the legs
God gave her Shes the right squaw for any bearhunter

She flashed back a smile of acknowledgment that included Smoke He
caught a feeling of chumminess though at the same time he was bitingly
aware that it was very much of a woman who embraced him in that
comradely smile

Looking back as they came to the bank of Squaw Creek they could see
the stampede strung out irregularly struggling along the descent of
the divide

They slipped down the bank to the creek bed The stream frozen
solidly to bottom was from twenty to thirty feet wide and ran between
six and eightfoot earth banks of alluvial wash No recent feet had
disturbed the snow that lay upon its ice and they knew they were above
the Discovery claim and the last stakes of the Sea Lion stampeders

Look out for springs Joy warned as Smoke led the way down the
creek At seventy below youll lose your feet if you break through

These springs common to most Klondike streams never ceased at the
lowest temperatures The water flowed out from the banks and lay in
pools which were cuddled from the cold by later surfacefreezings and
snow falls Thus a man stepping on dry snow might break through
half an inch of iceskin and find himself up to the knees in water In
five minutes unless able to remove the wet gear the loss of ones
foot was the penalty

Though only three in the afternoon the long grey twilight of the
Arctic had settled down They watched for a blazed tree on either
bank which would show the centrestake of the last claim located Joy
impulsively eager was the first to find it She darted ahead of
Smoke crying Somebodys been here See the snow Look for the
blaze There it is See that spruce

She sank suddenly to her waist in the snow

Now Ive done it she said woefully Then she cried Dont come
near me Ill wade out

Step by step each time breaking through the thin skin of ice concealed
under the dry snow she forced her way to solid footing Smoke did not
wait but sprang to the bank where dry and seasoned twigs and sticks
lodged amongst the brush by spring freshets waited the match By the
time she reached his side the first flames and flickers of an assured
fire were rising

Sit down he commanded

She obediently sat down in the snow He slipped his pack from his
back and spread a blanket for her feet

From above came the voices of the stampeders who followed them

Let Shorty stake she urged

Go on Shorty Smoke said as he attacked her moccasins already
stiff with ice Pace off a thousand feet and place the two
centrestakes We can fix the cornerstakes afterwards

With his knife Smoke cut away the lacings and leather of the moccasins
So stiff were they with ice that they snapped and crackled under the
hacking and sawing The Siwash socks and heavy woollen stockings were
sheaths of ice It was as if her feet and calves were encased in
corrugated iron

How are your feet he asked as he worked

Pretty numb I cant move nor feel my toes But it will be all
right The fire is burning beautifully Watch out you dont freeze
your own hands They must be numb now from the way youre fumbling

He slipped his mittens on and for nearly a minute smashed the open
hands savagely against his sides When he felt the bloodprickles he
pulled off the mittens and ripped and tore and sawed and hacked at the
frozen garments The white skin of one foot appeared then that of the
other to be exposed to the bite of seventy below zero which is the
equivalent of one hundred and two below freezing

Then came the rubbing with snow carried on with an intensity of cruel
fierceness till she squirmed and shrank and moved her toes and
joyously complained of the hurt

He halfdragged her and she halflifted herself nearer to the fire
He placed her feet on the blanket close to the fleshsaving flames

Youll have to take care of them for a while he said

She could now safely remove her mittens and manipulate her own feet
with the wisdom of the initiated being watchful that the heat of the
fire was absorbed slowly While she did this he attacked his hands
The snow did not melt nor moisten Its light crystals were like so
much sand Slowly the stings and pangs of circulation came back into
the chilled flesh Then he tended the fire unstrapped the light pack
from her back and got out a complete change of footgear

Shorty returned along the creekbed and climbed the bank to them

I sure staked a full thousan feet he proclaimed Number
twentyseven and number twentyeight though Id only got the upper
stake of twentyseven when I met the first geezer of the bunch behind
He just straight declared I wasnt goin to stake twentyeight An I
told him    

Yes yes Joy cried What did you tell him

Well I told him straight that if he didnt back up plum five hundred
feet Id sure punch his frozen nose into icecream an chocolate
eclaires He backed up an Ive got in the centrestakes of two full
an honest fivehundredfoot claims He staked next and I guess by
now the bunch has Squaw Creek located to headwaters an down the other
side Ourn is safe Its too dark to see now but we can put out the
cornerstakes in the mornin



III

When they awoke they found a change had taken place during the night
So warm was it that Shorty and Smoke still in their mutual blankets
estimated the temperature at no more than twenty below The cold snap
had broken On top their blankets lay six inches of frost crystals

Good morning hows your feet was Smokes greeting across the ashes
of the fire to where Joy Gastell carefully shaking aside the snow was
sitting up in her sleeping furs

Shorty built the fire and quarried ice from the creek while Smoke
cooked breakfast Daylight came on as they finished the meal

You go an fix them cornerstakes Smoke Shorty said Theres a
gravel under where I chopped ice for the coffee an Im goin to melt
water and wash a pan of that same gravel for luck

Smoke departed axe in hand to blaze the stakes Starting from the
downstream centrestake of twentyseven he headed at right angles
across the narrow valley towards its rim He proceeded methodically
almost automatically for his mind was alive with recollections of the
night before He felt somehow that he had won to empery over the
delicate lines and firm muscles of those feet and ankles he had rubbed
with snow and this empery seemed to extend to all women In dim and
fiery ways a feeling of possession mastered him It seemed that all
that was necessary was for him to walk up to this Joy Gastell take her
hand in his and say Come

It was in this mood that he discovered something that made him forget
empery over the white feet of woman At the valley rim he blazed no
cornerstake He did not reach the valley rim but instead he found
himself confronted by another stream He lined up with his eye a
blasted willow tree and a big and recognizable spruce He returned to
the stream where were the centre stakes He followed the bed of the
creek around a wide horseshoe bend through the flat and found that the
two creeks were the same creek Next he floundered twice through the
snow from valley rim to valley rim running the first line from the
lower stake of twentyseven the second from the upper stake of
twentyeight and he found that THE UPPER STAKE OF THE LATTER WAS
LOWER THAN THE LOWER STAKE OF THE FORMER In the gray twilight and
halfdarkness Shorty had located their two claims on the horseshoe

Smoke plodded back to the little camp Shorty at the end of washing a
pan of gravel exploded at sight of him

We got it Shorty cried holding out the pan Look at it A nasty
mess of gold Two hundred right there if its a cent She runs rich
from the top of the washgravel Ive churned around placers some but
I never got butter like whats in this pan

Smoke cast an incurious glance at the coarse gold poured himself a cup
of coffee at the fire and sat down Joy sensed something wrong and
looked at him with eagerly solicitous eyes Shorty however was
disgruntled by his partners lack of delight in the discovery

Why dont you kick in an get excited he demanded We got our pile
right here unless youre stickin up your nose at twohundreddollar
pans

Smoke took a swallow of coffee before replying

Shorty why are our two claims here like the Panama Canal

Whats the answer

Well the eastern entrance of the Panama Canal is west of the western
entrance thats all

Go on Shorty said I aint seen the joke yet

In short Shorty you staked our two claims on a big horseshoe bend

Shorty set the gold pan down in the snow and stood up

Go on he repeated

The upper stake of twentyeight is ten feet below the lower stake of
twentyseven

You mean we aint got nothin Smoke

Worse than that weve got ten feet less than nothing

Shorty departed down the bank on the run Five minutes later he
returned In response to Joys look he nodded Without speech he
went over to a log and sat down to gaze steadily at the snow in front
of his moccasins

We might as well break camp and start back for Dawson Smoke said
beginning to fold the blankets

I am sorry Smoke Joy said Its all my fault

Its all right he answered All in the days work you know

But its my fault wholly mine she persisted Dads staked for me
down near Discovery I know Ill give you my claim

He shook his head

Shorty she pleaded

Shorty shook his head and began to laugh It was a colossal laugh
Chuckles and muffled explosions yielded to hearty roars

It aint hysterics he explained I sure get powerful amused at
times an this is one of them

His gaze chanced to fall on the gold pan He walked over and gravely
kicked it scattering the gold over the landscape

It aint ourn he said It belongs to the geezer I backed up five
hundred feet last night An what gets me is four hundred an ninety
of them feet was to the good    his good Come on Smoke Lets
start the hike to Dawson Though if youre hankerin to kill me I
wont lift a finger to prevent




SHORTY DREAMS




I

Funny you dont gamble none Shorty said to Smoke one night in the
Elkhorn Aint it in your blood

It is Smoke answered But the statistics are in my head I like
an even break for my money

All about them in the huge barroom arose the click and rattle and
rumble of a dozen games at which furclad moccasined men tried their
luck Smoke waved his hand to include them all

Look at them he said Its cold mathematics that they will lose
more than they win tonight that the big proportion is losing right
now

Youre sure strong on figgers Shorty murmured admiringly An in
the main youre right But theys such a thing as facts An one fact
is streaks of luck Theys times when every geezer playin wins as I
know for Ive sat in in such games an saw moren one bank busted
The only way to win at gamblin is wait for a hunch that youve got a
lucky streak comin and then to play it to the roof

It sounds simple Smoke criticized So simple I cant see how men
can lose

The trouble is Shorty admitted that most men gets fooled on their
hunches On occasion I sure get fooled on mine The thing is to try
an find out

Smoke shook his head

Thats a statistic too Shorty Most men prove wrong on their
hunches

But dont you ever get one of them streaky feelins that all you got
to do is put your money down an pick a winner

Smoke laughed

Im too scared of the percentage against me But Ill tell you what
Shorty Ill throw a dollar on the high card right now and see if it
will buy us a drink

Smoke was edging his way in to the faro table when Shorty caught his
arm

Hold on Im gettin one of them hunches now You put that dollar on
roulette

They went over to a roulette table near the bar

Wait till I give the word Shorty counselled

What number Smoke asked

Pick it yourself But wait till I say let her go

You dont mean to say Ive got an even chance on that table Smoke
argued

As good as the next geezers

But not as good as the banks

Wait and see Shorty urged Now Let her go

The gamekeeper had just sent the little ivory ball whirling around the
smooth rim above the revolving manyslotted wheel Smoke at the
lower end of the table reached over a player and blindly tossed the
dollar It slid along the smooth green cloth and stopped fairly in
the centre of 34

The ball came to rest and the gamekeeper announced Thirtyfour
wins He swept the table and alongside of Smokes dollar stacked
thirtyfive dollars Smoke drew the money in and Shorty slapped him
on the shoulder

Now that was the real goods of a hunch Smoke Howd I know it
Theres no tellin I just knew youd win Why if that dollar of
yournd fell on any other number itd won just the same When the
hunch is right you just cant help winnin

Suppose it had come double nought Smoke queried as they made
their way to the bar

Then your dollard ben on double nought was Shortys answer
Theys no gettin away from it A hunch is a hunch Heres how Come
on back to the table I got a hunch after pickin you for a winner
that I can pick some few numbers myself

Are you playing a system Smoke asked at the end of ten minutes
when his partner had dropped a hundred dollars

Shorty shook his head indignantly as he spread his chips out in the
vicinities of 3 11 and 17 and tossed a spare chip on the
green

Hell is sure cluttered with geezers that played systems he
exposited as the keeper raked the table

From idly watching Smoke became fascinated following closely every
detail of the game from the whirling of the ball to the making and the
paying of the bets He made no plays however merely contenting
himself with looking on Yet so interested was he that Shorty
announcing that he had had enough with difficulty drew Smoke away from
the table The gamekeeper returned Shorty the gold sack he had
deposited as a credential for playing and with it went a slip of paper
on which was scribbled Out    350 dollars Shorty carried the
sack and the paper across the room and handed them to the weigher who
sat behind a large pair of goldscales Out of Shortys sack he weighed
350 dollars which he poured into the coffer of the house

That hunch of yours was another one of those statistics Smoke jeered

I had to play it didnt I in order to find out Shorty retorted I
reckon I was crowdin some just on account of tryin to convince you
theys such a thing as hunches

Never mind Shorty Smoke laughed Ive got a hunch right now

Shortys eyes sparkled as he cried eagerly What is it Kick in an
play it pronto

Its not that kind Shorty Now what Ive got is a hunch that some
day Ill work out a system that will beat the spots off that table

System Shorty groaned then surveyed his partner with a vast pity
Smoke listen to your sidekicker an leave system alone Systems is
sure losers They aint no hunches in systems

Thats why I like them Smoke answered A system is statistical
When you get the right system you cant lose and thats the difference
between it and a hunch You never know when the right hunch is going
wrong

But I know a lot of systems that went wrong an I never seen a system
win Shorty paused and sighed Look here Smoke if youre gettin
cracked on systems this aint no place for you an its about time we
hit the trail again



II

During the several following weeks the two partners played at cross
purposes Smoke was bent on spending his time watching the roulette
game in the Elkhorn while Shorty was equally bent on travelling trail
At last Smoke put his foot down when a stampede was proposed for two
hundred miles down the Yukon

Look here Shorty he said Im not going That trip will take ten
days and before that time I hope to have my system in proper working
order I could almost win with it now What are you dragging me
around the country this way for anyway

Smoke I got to take care of you was Shortys reply Youre
getting nutty Id drag you stampedin to Jericho or the North Pole if
I could keep you away from that table

Its all right Shorty But just remember Ive reached full
mangrown meateating size The only dragging youll do will be
dragging home the dust Im going to win with that system of mine and
youll most likely have to do it with a dogteam

Shortys response was a groan

And I dont want you to be bucking any games on your own Smoke went
on Were going to divide the winnings and Ill need all our money
to get started That systems young yet and its liable to trip me
for a few falls before I get it lined up



III

At last after long hours and days spent at watching the table the
night came when Smoke proclaimed he was ready and Shorty glum and
pessimistic with all the seeming of one attending a funeral
accompanied his partner to the Elkhorn Smoke bought a stack of chips
and stationed himself at the gamekeepers end of the table Again and
again the ball was whirled and the other players won or lost but Smoke
did not venture a chip Shorty waxed impatient

Buck in buck in he urged Lets get this funeral over Whats
the matter Got cold feet

Smoke shook his head and waited A dozen plays went by and then
suddenly he placed ten onedollar chips on 26 The number won and
the keeper paid Smoke three hundred and fifty dollars A dozen plays
went by twenty plays and thirty when Smoke placed ten dollars on
32 Again he received three hundred and fifty dollars

Its a hunch Shorty whispered vociferously in his ear Ride it
Ride it

Half an hour went by during which Smoke was inactive then he placed
ten dollars on 34 and won

A hunch Shorty whispered

Nothing of the sort Smoke whispered back Its the system Isnt
she a dandy

You cant tell me Shorty contended Hunches comes in mighty funny
ways You might think its a system but it aint Systems is
impossible They cant happen Its a sure hunch youre playin

Smoke now altered his play He bet more frequently with single chips
scattered here and there and he lost more often than he won

Quit it Shorty advised Cash in Youve rung the bulls eye three
times an youre ahead a thousand You cant keep it up

At this moment the ball started whirling and Smoke dropped ten chips
on 26 The ball fell into the slot of 26 and the keeper again
paid him three hundred and fifty dollars If youre plum crazy an
got the immortal cinch betm the limit Shorty said Put down
twentyfive next time

A quarter of an hour passed during which Smoke won and lost on small
scattering bets Then with the abruptness that characterized his big
betting he placed twentyfive dollars on the double nought and the
keeper paid him eight hundred and seventyfive dollars

Wake me up Smoke Im dreamin Shorty moaned

Smoke smiled consulted his notebook and became absorbed in
calculation He continually drew the notebook from his pocket and
from time to time jotted down figures

A crowd had packed densely around the table while the players
themselves were attempting to cover the same numbers he covered It
was then that a change came over his play Ten times in succession he
placed ten dollars on 18 and lost At this stage he was deserted by
the hardiest He changed his number and won another three hundred and
fifty dollars Immediately the players were back with him deserting
again after a series of losing bets

Quit it Smoke quit it Shorty advised The longest string of
hunches is only so long an your strings finished No more
bullseyes for you

Im going to ring her once again before I cash in Smoke answered

For a few minutes with varying luck he played scattering chips over
the table and then dropped twentyfive dollars on the double nought

Ill take my slip now he said to the dealer as he won

Oh you dont need to show it to me Shorty said as they walked to
the weigher I ben keepin track Youre something like thirtysix
hundred to the good How near am I

Thirtysixthirty Smoke replied And now youve got to pack the
dust home That was the agreement



IV

Dont crowd your luck Shorty pleaded with Smoke the next night in
the cabin as he evidenced preparations to return to the Elkhorn You
played a mighty long string of hunches but you played it out If you
go back youll sure drop all your winnings

But I tell you it isnt hunches Shorty Its statistics Its a
system It cant lose

System be damned They aint no such a thing as system I made
seventeen straight passes at a crap table once Was it system Nope
It was fool luck only I had cold feet an didnt dast let it ride It
itd rid instead of me drawin down after the third pass Id a won
over thirty thousan on the original twobit piece

Just the same Shorty this is a real system

Huh You got to show me

I did show you Come on with me now and Ill show you again

When they entered the Elkhorn all eyes centred on Smoke and those
about the table made way for him as he took up his old place at the
keepers end His play was quite unlike that of the previous night In
the course of an hour and a half he made only four bets but each bet
was for twentyfive dollars and each bet won He cashed in
thirtyfive hundred dollars and Shorty carried the dust home to the
cabin

Nows the time to jump the game Shorty advised as he sat on the
edge of his bunk and took off his moccasins Youre seven thousan
ahead A mans a fool thatd crowd his luck harder

Shorty a man would be a blithering lunatic if he didnt keep on
backing a winning system like mine

Smoke youre a sure bright boy Youre collegelearnt You know
moren a minute than I could know in forty thousan years But just
the same youre dead wrong when you call your luck a system Ive ben
around some an seen a few an I tell you straight an confidential
an allassurin a system to beat a bankin game aint possible

But Im showing you this one Its a pipe

No youre not Smoke Its a pipedream Im asleep Bime by Ill
wake up an build the fire an start breakfast

Well my unbelieving friend theres the dust Heft it

So saying Smoke tossed the bulging goldsack upon his partners knees
It weighed thirtyfive pounds and Shorty was fully aware of the crush
of its impact on his flesh

Its real Smoke hammered his point home

Huh Ive saw some mighty real dreams in my time In a dream all
things is possible In real life a system aint possible Now I
aint never ben to college but Im plum justified in sizin up this
gamblin orgy of ourn as a sure enough dream

Hamiltons Law of Parsimony Smoke laughed

I aint never heard of the geezer but his dopes sure right Im
dreamin Smoke an youre just snoopin around in my dream an
tormentin me with system If you love me if you sure do love me
youll just yell Shorty Wake up An Ill wake up an start
breakfast



V

The third night of play as Smoke laid his first bet the gamekeeper
shoved fifteen dollars back to him

Tens all you can play he said The limits come down

Gettin picayune Shorty sneered

No one has to play at this table that dont want to the keeper
retorted And Im willing to say straight out in meeting that wed
sooner your pardner didnt play at our table

Scared of his system eh Shorty challenged as the keeper paid over
three hundred and fifty dollars

I aint saying I believe in system because I dont There never was
a system thatd beat roulette or any percentage game But just the
same Ive seen some queer strings of luck and I aint going to let
this bank go bust if I can help it

Cold feet

Gambling is just as much business my friend as any other business
We aint philanthropists

Night by night Smoke continued to win His method of play varied
Expert after expert in the jam about the table scribbled down his
bets and numbers in vain attempts to work out his system They
complained of their inability to get a clew to start with and swore
that it was pure luck though the most colossal streak of it they had
ever seen

It was Smokes varied play that obfuscated them Sometimes consulting
his notebook or engaging in long calculations an hour elapsed without
his staking a chip At other times he would win three limitbets and
clean up a thousand dollars and odd in five or ten minutes At still
other times his tactics would be to scatter single chips prodigally
and amazingly over the table This would continue for from ten to
thirty minutes of play when abruptly as the ball whirled through the
last few of its circles he would play the limit on column colour and
number and win all three Once to complete confusion in the minds of
those that strove to divine his secret he lost forty straight bets
each at the limit But each night play no matter how diversely
Shorty carried home thirtyfive hundred dollars for him

It aint no system Shorty expounded at one of their bedgoing
discussions I follow you an follow you but they aint no
figgerin it out You never play twice the same All you do is pick
winners when you want to an when you dont want to you just on
purpose dont

Maybe youre nearer right than you think Shorty Ive just got to
pick losers sometimes Its part of the system

Systemhell Ive talked with every gambler in town an the last
one is agreed they aint no such thing as system

Yet Im showing them one all the time

Look here Smoke Shorty paused over the candle in the act of
blowing it out Im real irritated Maybe you think this is a
candle It aint An this aint me neither Im out on trail
somewheres in my blankets lyin on my back with my mouth open an
dreamin all this That aint you talkin any more than this candle
is a candle

Its funny how I happen to be dreaming along with you then Smoke
persisted

No it aint Youre part of my dream thats all Ive hearn many a
man talk in my dreams I want to tell you one thing Smoke Im
gettin mangy an mad If this here dream keeps up much more Im goin
to bite my veins an howl



VI

On the sixth night of play at the Elkhorn the limit was reduced to
five dollars

Its all right Smoke assured the gamekeeper I want thirtyfive
hundred tonight as usual and you only compel me to play longer
Ive got to pick twice as many winners thats all

Why dont you buck somebody elses table the keeper demanded
wrathfully

Because I like this one Smoke glanced over to the roaring stove only
a few feet away Besides there are no draughts here and it is warm
and comfortable

On the ninth night when Shorty had carried the dust home he had a fit

I quit Smoke I quit he began I know when I got enough I aint
dreamin Im wide awake A system cant be but you got one just the
same Theres nothin in the rule o three The almanacs clean out
The worlds gone smash Theres nothin regular an uniform no more
The multiplication tables gone loco Two is eight nine is eleven
and twotimessix is eight hundred an fortysixanan a half
Anything is everything an nothings all an twice all is cold cream
milkshakes an calico horses Youve got a system Figgers beat the
figgerin What aint is an what isnt has to be The sun rises in
the west the moons a paystreak the stars is canned cornbeef
scurvys the blessin of God him that dies kicks again rocks floats
waters gas I aint me youre somebody else an mebbe were twins if
we aint hashedbrown potatoes fried in verdigris Wake me up
Somebody Oh Wake me up



VII

The next morning a visitor came to the cabin Smoke knew him Harvey
Moran the owner of all the games in the Tivoli There was a note of
appeal in his deep gruff voice as he plunged into his business

Its like this Smoke he began Youve got us all guessing Im
representing nine other gameowners and myself from all the saloons in
town We dont understand We know that no system ever worked against
roulette All the mathematic sharps in the colleges have told us
gamblers the same thing They say that roulette itself is the system
the one and only system and therefore that no system can beat it
for that would mean arithmetic has gone bughouse

Shorty nodded his head violently

If a system can beat a system then theres no such thing as system
the gambler went on In such a case anything could be possiblea
thing could be in two different places at once or two things could be
in the same place thats only large enough for one at the same time

Well youve seen me play Smoke answered defiantly and if you
think its only a string of luck on my part why worry

Thats the trouble We cant help worrying Its a system youve
got and all the time we know it cant be Ive watched you five
nights now and all I can make out is that you favour certain numbers
and keep on winning Now the ten of us gameowners have got together
and we want to make a friendly proposition Well put a roulette table
in a back room of the Elkhorn pool the bank against you and have you
buck us It will be all quiet and private Just you and Shorty and
us What do you say

I think its the other way around Smoke answered Its up to you
to come and see me Ill be playing in the barroom of the Elkhorn
tonight You can watch me there just as well



VIII

That night when Smoke took up his customary place at the table the
keeper shut down the game

The games closed he said Bosss orders

But the assembled gameowners were not to be balked In a few minutes
they arranged a pool each putting in a thousand and took over the
table

Come on and buck us Harvey Moran challenged as the keeper sent the
ball on its first whirl around

Give me the twentyfive limit Smoke suggested

Sure go to it

Smoke immediately placed twentyfive chips on the double nought and
won

Moran wiped the sweat from his forehead

Go on he said We got ten thousand in this bank

At the end of an hour and a half the ten thousand was Smokes

The banks bust the keeper announced

Got enough Smoke asked

The gameowners looked at one another They were awed They the
fatted proteges of the laws of chance were undone They were up
against one who had more intimate access to those laws or who had
invoked higher and undreamed laws

We quit Moran said Aint that right Burke

Big Burke who owned the games in the M and G Saloon nodded

The impossible has happened he said This Smoke here has got a
system all right If we let him go on well all bust All I can see
if were goin to keep our tables running is to cut down the limit to
a dollar or to ten cents or a cent He wont win much in a night
with such stakes

All looked at Smoke He shrugged his shoulders

In that case gentlemen Ill have to hire a gang of men to play at
all your tables I can pay them ten dollars for a fourhour shift and
make money

Then well shut down our tables Big Burke replied Unless He
hesitated and ran his eye over his fellows to see that they were with
him Unless youre willing to talk business What will you sell the
system for

Thirty thousand dollars Smoke answered Thats a tax of three
thousand apiece

They debated and nodded

And youll tell us your system

Surely

And youll promise not to play roulette in Dawson ever again

No sir Smoke said positively Ill promise not to play this
system again

My God Moran exploded You havent got other systems have you

Hold on Shorty cried I want to talk to my pardner Come over
here Smoke on the side

Smoke followed into a quiet corner of the room while hundreds of
curious eyes centred on him and Shorty

Look here Smoke Shorty whispered hoarsely Mebbe it aint a
dream In which case youre sellin out almighty cheap Youve sure
got the world by the slack of its pants Theys millions in it Shake
it Shake it hard

But if its a dream Smoke queried softly

Then for the sake of the dream an the love of Mike stick them
gamblers up good and plenty Whats the good of dreamin if you cant
dream to the real right dead sure eternal finish

Fortunately this isnt a dream Shorty

Then if you sell out for thirty thousan Ill never forgive you

When I sell out for thirty thousand youll fall on my neck an wake
up to find out that you havent been dreaming at all This is no
dream Shorty In about two minutes youll see you have been wide
awake all the time Let me tell you that when I sell out its because
Ive got to sell out

Back at the table Smoke informed the gameowners that his offer still
held They proffered him their paper to the extent of three thousand
each

Hold out for the dust Shorty cautioned

I was about to intimate that Id take the money weighed out Smoke
said

The owner of the Elkhorn cashed their paper and Shorty took possession
of the golddust

Now I dont want to wake up he chortled as he hefted the various
sacks Toted up its a seventy thousan dream Its be too blamed
expensive to open my eyes roll out of the blankets an start
breakfast

Whats your system Big Burke demanded Weve paid for it and we
want it

Smoke led the way to the table

Now gentlemen bear with me a moment This isnt an ordinary system
It can scarcely be called legitimate but its one great virtue is that
it works Ive got my suspicious but Im not saying anything You
watch Mr Keeper be ready with the ball Wait I am going to pick
26 Consider Ive bet on it Be ready Mr KeeperNow

The ball whirled around

You observe Smoke went on that 9 was directly opposite

The ball finished in 26

Big Burke swore deep in his chest and all waited

For double nought to win 11 must be opposite Try it yourself
and see

But the system Moran demanded impatiently We know you can pick
winning numbers and we know what those numbers are but how do you do
it

By observed sequences By accident I chanced twice to notice the ball
whirled when 9 was opposite Both times 26 won After that I saw
it happen again Then I looked for other sequences and found them
Double nought opposite fetches 32 and 11 fetches double
nought It doesnt always happen but it USUALLY happens You notice
I say usually As I said before I have my suspicions but Im not
saying anything

Big Burke with a sudden dawn of comprehension reached over stopped
the wheel and examined it carefully The heads of the nine other
gameowners bent over and joined in the examination Big Burke
straightened up and cast a glance at the nearby stove

Hell he said It wasnt any system at all The table stood close
to the fire and the blamed wheels warped And weve been worked to a
frazzle No wonder he liked this table He couldnt have bucked for
sour apples at any other table

Harvey Moran gave a great sigh of relief and wiped his forehead

Well anyway he said its cheap at the price just to find out that
it wasnt a system His face began to work and then he broke into
laughter and slapped Smoke on the shoulder Smoke you had us going
for a while and we patting ourselves on the back because you were
letting our tables alone Say Ive got some real fizz Ill open if
all youll come over to the Tivoli with me

Later back in the cabin Shorty silently overhauled and hefted the
various bulging goldsacks He finally piled them on the table sat
down on the edge of his bunk and began taking off his moccasins

Seventy thousan he calculated It weighs three hundred and fifty
pounds And all out of a warped wheel an a quick eye Smoke you
eatm raw you eatm alive you work under water youve given me the
jimjams but just the same I know its a dream Its only in dreams
that the good things comes true Im almighty unanxious to wake up I
hope I never wake up

Cheer up Smoke answered You wont There are a lot of philosophy
sharps that think men are sleepwalkers Youre in good company

Shorty got up went to the table selected the heaviest sack and
cuddled it in his arms as if it were a baby

I may be sleepwalkin he said but as you say Im sure in mighty
good company




THE MAN ON THE OTHER BANK




I

It was before Smoke Bellew staked the farcical townsite of TraLee
made the historic corner of eggs that nearly broke Swiftwater Bills
bank account or won the dogteam race down the Yukon for an even
million dollars that he and Shorty parted company on the Upper
Klondike Shortys task was to return down the Klondike to Dawson to
record some claims they had staked

Smoke with the dogteam turned south His quest was Surprise Lake
and the mythical Two Cabins His traverse was to cut the headwaters of
the Indian River and cross the unknown region over the mountains to the
Stewart River Here somewhere rumour persisted was Surprise Lake
surrounded by jagged mountains and glaciers its bottom paved with raw
gold Oldtimers it was said whose very names were forgotten in the
forests of earlier years had dived in the icewaters of Surprise Lake
and fetched lumpgold to the surface in both hands At different
times parties of oldtimers had penetrated the forbidding fastness and
sampled the lakes golden bottom But the water was too cold Some
died in the water being pulled up dead Others died of consumption
And one who had gone down never did come up All survivors had planned
to return and drain the lake yet none had ever gone back Disaster
always happened One man fell into an airhole below Forty Mile
another was killed and eaten by his dogs a third was crushed by a
falling tree And so the tale ran Surprise Lake was a hoodoo its
location was unremembered and the gold still paved its undrained
bottom

Two Cabins no less mythical was more definitely located Five
sleeps up the McQuestion River from the Stewart stood two ancient
cabins So ancient were they that they must have been built before
ever the first known goldhunter had entered the Yukon Basin Wandering
moosehunters whom even Smoke had met and talked with claimed to have
found the two cabins in the old days but to have sought vainly for the
mine which those early adventurers must have worked

I wish you was goin with me Shorty said wistfully at parting
Just because you got the Indian bug aint no reason for to go pokin
into trouble Theys no gettin away from it thats loco country
youre bound for The hoodoos sure on it from the first flip to the
last call judgin from all you an me has hearn tell about it

Its all right Shorty Ill make the round trip and be back in
Dawson in six weeks The Yukon trail is packed and the first hundred
miles or so of the Stewart ought to be packed Oldtimers from
Henderson have told me a number of outfits went up last fall after the
freezeup When I strike their trail I ought to hit her up forty or
fifty miles a day Im likely to be back inside a month once I get
across

Yes once you get acrost But its the gettin acrost that worries
me Well so long Smoke Keep your eyes open for that hoodoo thats
all An dont be ashamed to turn back if you dont kill any meat



II

A week later Smoke found himself among the jumbled ranges south of
Indian River On the divide from the Klondike he had abandoned the
sled and packed his wolfdogs The six big huskies each carried fifty
pounds and on his own back was an equal burden Through the soft snow
he led the way packing it down under his snowshoes and behind in
single file toiled the dogs

He loved the life the deep arctic winter the silent wilderness the
unending snowsurface unpressed by the foot of any man About him
towered icy peaks unnamed and uncharted No hunters campsmoke
rising in the still air of the valleys ever caught his eye He alone
moved through the brooding quiet of the untravelled wastes nor was he
oppressed by the solitude He loved it all the days toil the
bickering wolfdogs the making of the camp in the long twilight the
leaping stars overhead and the flaming pageant of the aurora borealis

Especially he loved his camp at the end of the day and in it he saw a
picture which he ever yearned to paint and which he knew he would never
forgeta beaten place in the snow where burned his fire his bed a
couple of rabbitskin robes spread on freshchopped spruceboughs his
shelter a stretched strip of canvas that caught and threw back the
heat of the fire the blackened coffeepot and pail resting on a length
of log the moccasins propped on sticks to dry the snowshoes upended
in the snow and across the fire the wolfdogs snuggling to it for the
warmth wistful and eager furry and frostrimed with bushy tails
curled protectingly over their feet and all about pressed backward
but a space the wall of encircling darkness

At such times San Francisco The Billow and OHara seemed very far
away lost in a remote past shadows of dreams that had never happened
He found it hard to believe that he had known any other life than this
of the wild and harder still was it for him to reconcile himself to
the fact that he had once dabbled and dawdled in the Bohemian drift of
city life Alone with no one to talk to he thought much and deeply
and simply He was appalled by the wastage of his city years by the
cheapness now of the philosophies of the schools and books of the
clever cynicism of the studio and editorial room of the cant of the
business men in their clubs They knew neither food nor sleep nor
health nor could they ever possibly know the sting of real appetite
the goodly ache of fatigue nor the rush of mad strong blood that bit
like wine through all ones body as work was done

And all the time this fine wise Spartan North Land had been here and
he had never known What puzzled him was that with such intrinsic
fitness he had never heard the slightest calling whisper had not
himself gone forth to seek But this too he solved in time

Look here Yellowface Ive got it clear

The dog addressed lifted first one forefoot and then the other with
quick appeasing movements curled his bush of a tail about them again
and laughed across the fire

Herbert Spencer was nearly forty before he caught the vision of his
greatest efficiency and desire Im none so slow I didnt have to
wait till I was thirty to catch mine Right here is my efficiency and
desire Almost Yellow Face do I wish I had been born a wolfboy and
been brother all my days to you and yours

For days he wandered through a chaos of canyons and divides which did
not yield themselves to any rational topographical plan It was as if
they had been flung there by some cosmic joker In vain he sought for
a creek or feeder that flowed truly south toward the McQuestion and the
Stewart Then came a mountain storm that blew a blizzard across the
riffraff of high and shallow divides Above timberline fireless
for two days he struggled blindly to find lower levels On the second
day he came out upon the rim of an enormous palisade So thickly drove
the snow that he could not see the base of the wall nor dared he
attempt the descent He rolled himself in his robes and huddled the
dogs about him in the depths of a snowdrift but did not permit
himself to sleep

In the morning the storm spent he crawled out to investigate A
quarter of a mile beneath him beyond all mistake lay a frozen
snowcovered lake About it on every side rose jagged peaks It
answered the description Blindly he had found Surprise Lake

Wellnamed he muttered an hour later as he came out upon its
margin A clump of aged spruce was the only woods On his way to it
he stumbled upon three graves snowburied but marked by handhewn
headposts and undecipherable writing On the edge of the woods was a
small ramshackle cabin He pulled the latch and entered In a corner
on what had once been a bed of spruceboughs still wrapped in mangy
furs that had rotted to fragments lay a skeleton The last visitor
to Surprise Lake was Smokes conclusion as he picked up a lump of
gold as large as his doubled fist Beside the lump was a peppercan
filled with nuggets of the size of walnuts roughsurfaced showing no
signs of wash

So true had the tale run that Smoke accepted without question that the
source of the gold was the lakes bottom Under many feet of ice and
inaccessible there was nothing to be done and at midday from the
rim of the palisade he took a farewell look back and down at his find

Its all right Mr Lake he said You just keep right on staying
there Im coming back to drain youif that hoodoo doesnt catch me
I dont know how I got here but Ill know by the way I go out



III

In a little valley beside a frozen stream and under beneficent spruce
trees he built a fire four days later Somewhere in that white
anarchy he left behind him was Surprise Lakesomewhere he knew not
where for a hundred hours of driftage and struggle through blinding
driving snow had concealed his course from him and he knew not in
what direction lay BEHIND It was as if he had just emerged from a
nightmare He was not sure that four days or a week had passed He
had slept with the dogs fought across a forgotten number of shallow
divides followed the windings of weird canyons that ended in pockets
and twice had managed to make a fire and thaw out frozen moosemeat
And here he was wellfed and wellcamped The storm had passed and it
had turned clear and cold The lay of the land had again become
rational The creek he was on was natural in appearance and trended
as it should toward the southwest But Surprise Lake was as lost to
him as it had been to all its seekers in the past

Half a days journey down the creek brought him to the valley of a
larger stream which he decided was the McQuestion Here he shot a
moose and once again each wolfdog carried a full fiftypound pack of
meat As he turned down the McQuestion he came upon a sledtrail
The late snows had drifted over but underneath it was wellpacked by
travel His conclusion was that two camps had been established on the
McQuestion and that this was the connecting trail Evidently Two
Cabins had been found and it was the lower camp so he headed down the
stream

It was forty below zero when he camped that night and he fell asleep
wondering who were the men who had rediscovered the Two Cabins and if
he would fetch it next day At the first hint of dawn he was under
way easily following the halfobliterated trail and packing the recent
snow with his webbed shoes so that the dogs should not wallow

And then it came the unexpected leaping out upon him on a bend of the
river It seemed to him that he heard and felt simultaneously The
crack of the rifle came from the right and the bullet tearing through
and across the shoulders of his drill parka and woollen coat pivoted
him half around with the shock of its impact He staggered on his
twisted snowshoes to recover balance and heard a second crack of the
rifle This time it was a clean miss He did not wait for more but
plunged across the snow for the sheltering trees of the bank a hundred
feet away Again and again the rifle cracked and he was unpleasantly
aware of a trickle of warm moisture down his back

He climbed the bank the dogs floundering behind and dodged in among
the trees and brush Slipping out of his snowshoes he wallowed
forward at full length and peered cautiously out Nothing was to be
seen Whoever had shot at him was lying quiet among the trees of the
opposite bank

If something doesnt happen pretty soon he muttered at the end of
half an hour Ill have to sneak away and build a fire or freeze my
feet Yellow Face whatd you do lying in the frost with circulation
getting slack and a man trying to plug you

He crawled back a few yards packed down the snow danced a jig that
sent the blood back into his feet and managed to endure another half
hour Then from down the river he heard the unmistakable jingle of
dogbells Peering out he saw a sled round the bend Only one man was
with it straining at the geepole and urging the dogs along The
effect on Smoke was one of shock for it was the first human he had
seen since he parted from Shorty three weeks before His next thought
was of the potential murderer concealed on the opposite bank

Without exposing himself Smoke whistled warningly The man did not
hear and came on rapidly Again and more sharply Smoke whistled
The man whoad his dogs stopped and had turned and faced Smoke when
the rifle cracked The instant afterwards Smoke fired into the wood
in the direction of the sound The man on the river had been struck by
the first shot The shock of the high velocity bullet staggered him
He stumbled awkwardly to the sled halffalling and pulled a rifle out
from under the lashings As he strove to raise it to his shoulder he
crumpled at the waist and sank down slowly to a sitting posture on the
sled Then abruptly as the gun went off aimlessly he pitched
backward and across a corner of the sledload so that Smoke could see
only his legs and stomach

From below came more jingling bells The man did not move Around the
bend swung three sleds accompanied by half a dozen men Smoke cried
warningly but they had seen the condition of the first sled and they
dashed on to it No shots came from the other bank and Smoke calling
his dogs to follow emerged into the open There were exclamations
from the men and two of them flinging off the mittens of their right
hands levelled their rifles at him

Come on you redhanded murderer you one of them a blackbearded
man commanded an jest pitch that gun of yourn in the snow

Smoke hesitated then dropped his rifle and came up to them

Go through him Louis an take his weapons the blackbearded man
ordered

Louis a FrenchCanadian voyageur Smoke decided as were four of the
others obeyed His search revealed only Smokes hunting knife which
was appropriated

Now what have you got to say for yourself Stranger before I shoot
you dead the blackbearded man demanded

That youre making a mistake if you think I killed that man Smoke
answered

A cry came from one of the voyageurs He had quested along the trail
and found Smokes tracks where he had left it to take refuge on the
bank The man explained the nature of his find

Whatd you kill Joe Kinade for he of the black beard asked

I tell you I didnt Smoke began

Aw whats the good of talkin We got you redhanded Right up
theres where you left the trail when you heard him comin You laid
among the trees an bushwhacked him A short shot You couldnt
amissed Pierre go an get that gun he dropped

You might let me tell what happened Smoke objected

You shut up the man snarled at him I reckon your gunll tell the
story

All the men examined Smokes rifle ejecting and counting the
cartridges and examining the barrel at muzzle and breech

One shot Blackbeard concluded

Pierre with nostrils that quivered and distended like a deers
sniffed at the breech

Him one fresh shot he said

The bullet entered his back Smoke said He was facing me when he
was shot You see it came from the other bank

Blackbeard considered this proposition for a scant second and shook
his head

Nope It wont do Turn him around to face the other bankthats
how you whopped him in the back Some of you boys run up an down the
trail and see if you can see any tracks making for the other bank

Their report was that on that side the snow was unbroken Not even a
snowshoe rabbit had crossed it Blackbeard bending over the dead
man straightened up with a woolly furry wad in his hand Shredding
this he found imbedded in the centre the bullet which had perforated
the body Its nose was spread to the size of a halfdollar its
buttend steeljacketed was undamaged He compared it with a
cartridge from Smokes belt

Thats plain enough evidence Stranger to satisfy a blind man Its
softnosed an steeljacketed yourn is softnosed and steeljacketed
Its thirtythirty yourn is thirtythirty Its manufactured by the
J and T Arms Company yourn is manufactured by the J and T Arms
Company Now you come along an well go over to the bank an see jest
how you done it

I was bushwhacked myself Smoke said Look at the hole in my parka

While Blackbeard examined it one of the voyageurs threw open the
breech of the dead mans gun It was patent to all that it had been
fired once The empty cartridge was still in the chamber

A damn shame poor Joe didnt get you Blackbeard said bitterly But
he did pretty well with a hole like that in him Come on you

Search the other bank first Smoke urged

You shut up an come on an let the facts do the talkin

They left the trail at the same spot he had and followed it on up the
bank and in among the trees

Him dance that place keep him feet warm Louis pointed out That
place him crawl on belly That place him put one elbow wen him
shoot

And by God theres the empty cartridge he had done it with was
Blackbeards discovery Boys theres only one thing to do

You might ask me how I came to fire that shot Smoke interrupted

An I might knock your teeth into your gullet if you butt in again
You can answer them questions later on Now boys were decent an
lawabidin an we got to handle this right an regular How far do
you reckon weve come Pierre

Twenty mile I tink for sure

All right Well cache the outfit an run him an poor Joe back to
Two Cabins I reckon weve seen an can testify to whatll stretch his
neck



IV

It was three hours after dark when the dead man Smoke and his captors
arrived at Two Cabins By the starlight Smoke could make out a dozen
or more recently built cabins snuggling about a larger and older cabin
on a flat by the river bank Thrust inside this older cabin he found
it tenanted by a young giant of a man his wife and an old blind man
The woman whom her husband called Lucy was herself a strapping
creature of the frontier type The old man as Smoke learned
afterwards had been a trapper on the Stewart for years and had gone
finally blind the winter before The camp of Two Cabins he was also to
learn had been made the previous fall by a dozen men who arrived in
half as many polingboats loaded with provisions Here they had found
the blind trapper on the site of Two Cabins and about his cabin they
had built their own Later arrivals mushing up the ice with
dogteams had tripled the population There was plenty of meat in
camp and good lowpay dirt had been discovered and was being worked

In five minutes all the men of Two cabins were jammed into the room
Smoke shoved off into a corner ignored and scowled at his hands and
feet tied with thongs of moosehide looked on Thirtyeight men he
counted a wild and husky crew all frontiersmen of the States or
voyageurs from Upper Canada His captors told the tale over and over
each the centre of an excited and wrathful group There were mutterings
of Lynch him nowwhy wait And once a big Irishman was restrained
only by force from rushing upon the helpless prisoner and giving him a
beating

It was while counting the men that Smoke caught sight of a familiar
face It was Breck the man whose boat Smoke had run through the
rapids He wondered why the other did not come and speak to him but
himself gave no sign of recognition Later when with shielded face
Breck passed him a significant wink Smoke understood

Blackbeard whom Smoke heard called Eli Harding ended the discussion
as to whether or not the prisoner should be immediately lynched

Hold on Harding roared Keep your shirts on That man belongs to
me I caught him an I brought him here Dye think I brought him all
the way here to be lynched Not on your life I could adone that
myself when I found him I brought him here for a fair an impartial
trial an by God a fair an impartial trial hes goin to get Hes
tied up safe an sound Chuck him in a bunk till morning an well
hold the trial right here



V

Smoke woke up A draught that possessed all the rigidity of an
icicle was boring into the front of his shoulder as he lay on his side
facing the wall When he had been tied into the bunk there had been no
such draught and now the outside air driving into the heated
atmosphere of the cabin with the pressure of fifty below zero was
sufficient advertizement that some one from without had pulled away the
mosschinking between the logs He squirmed as far as his bonds would
permit then craned his neck forward until his lips just managed to
reach the crack

Who is it he whispered

Breck came the answer Be careful you dont make a noise Im
going to pass a knife in to you

No good Smoke said I couldnt use it My hands are tied behind
me and made fast to the leg of the bunk Besides you couldnt get a
knife through that crack But something must be done Those fellows
are of a temper to hang me and of course you know I didnt kill that
man

It wasnt necessary to mention it Smoke And if you did you had your
reasons Which isnt the point at all I want to get you out of this
Its a tough bunch of men here Youve seen them Theyre shut off
from the world and they make and enforce their own lawby miners
meeting you know They handled two men alreadyboth grubthieves
One they hiked from camp without an ounce of grub and no matches He
made about forty miles and lasted a couple of days before he froze
stiff Two weeks ago they hiked the second man They gave him his
choice no grub or ten lashes for each days ration He stood for
forty lashes before he fainted And now theyve got you and every
last one is convinced you killed Kinade

The man who killed Kinade shot at me too His bullet broke the skin
on my shoulder Get them to delay the trial till some one goes up and
searches the bank where the murderer hid

No use They take the evidence of Harding and the five Frenchmen with
him Besides they havent had a hanging yet and theyre keen for it
You see things have been pretty monotonous They havent located
anything big and they got tired of hunting for Surprise Lake They
did some stampeding the first part of the winter but theyve got over
that now Scurvy is beginning to show up amongst them too and
theyre just ripe for excitement

And it looks like Ill furnish it was Smokes comment Say Breck
how did you ever fall in with such a Godforsaken bunch

After I got the claims at Squaw Creek opened up and some men to
working I came up here by way of the Stewart hunting for Two Cabins
Theyd beaten me to it so Ive been higher up the Stewart Just got
back yesterday out of grub

Find anything

Nothing much But I think Ive got a hydraulic proposition thatll
work big when the countrys opened up Its that or a golddredger

Hold on Smoke interrupted Wait a minute Let me think

He was very much aware of the snores of the sleepers as he pursued the
idea that had flashed into his mind

Say Breck have they opened up the meatpacks my dogs carried

A couple I was watching They put them in Hardings cache

Did they find anything

Meat

Good Youve got to get into the brown canvas pack thats patched
with moosehide Youll find a few pounds of lumpy gold Youve never
seen gold like it in the country nor has anybody else Heres what
youve got to do Listen

A quarter of an hour later fully instructed and complaining that his
toes were freezing Breck went away Smoke his own nose and one cheek
frosted by proximity to the chink rubbed them against the blankets for
half an hour before the blaze and bite of the returning blood assured
him of the safety of his flesh



VI

My minds made up right now There aint no doubt but what he killed
Kinade We heard the whole thing last night Whats the good of goin
over it again I vote guilty

In such fashion Smokes trial began The speaker a loosejointed
hardrock man from Colorado manifested irritation and disgust when
Harding set his suggestion aside demanded the proceedings should be
regular and nominated one Shunk Wilson for judge and chairman of the
meeting The population of Two Cabins constituted the jury though
after some discussion the woman Lucy was denied the right to vote on
Smokes guilt or innocence

While this was going on Smoke jammed into a corner on a bunk
overheard a whispered conversation between Breck and a miner

You havent fifty pounds of flour youll sell Breck queried

You aint got the dust to pay the price Im askin was the reply

Ill give you two hundred

The man shook his head

Three hundred Threefifty

At four hundred the man nodded and said Come on over to my cabin
an weigh out the dust

The two squeezed their way to the door and slipped out After a few
minutes Breck returned alone

Harding was testifying when Smoke saw the door shoved open slightly
and in the crack appear the face of the man who had sold the flour He
was grimacing and beckoning emphatically to one inside who arose from
near the stove and started to work toward the door

Where are you goin Sam Shunk Wilson demanded

Ill be back in a jiffy Sam explained I jes got to go

Smoke was permitted to question the witnesses and he was in the middle
of the crossexamination of Harding when from without came the whining
of dogs in harness and the grind and churn of sledrunners Somebody
near the door peeped out

Its Sam an his pardner an a dogteam hellbent down the trail for
Stewart River the man reported

Nobody spoke for a long halfminute but men glanced significantly at
one another and a general restlessness pervaded the packed room Out
of the corner of his eye Smoke caught a glimpse of Breck Lucy and
her husband whispering together

Come on you Shunk Wilson said gruffly to Smoke Cut this
questionin short We know what youre tryin to provethat the other
bank wasnt searched The witness admits it We admit it It wasnt
necessary No tracks led to that bank The snow wasnt broke

There was a man on the other bank just the same Smoke insisted

Thats too thin for skatin young man There aint many of us on the
McQuestion an we got every man accounted for

Who was the man you hiked out of camp two weeks ago Smoke asked

Alonzo Miramar He was a Mexican Whats that grubthief got to do
with it

Nothing except that you havent accounted for HIM Mr Judge

He went down the river not up

How do you know where he went

Saw him start

And thats all you know of what became of him

No it aint young man I know we all know he had four days grub
an no gun to shoot meat with If he didnt make the settlement on the
Yukon hed croaked long before this

I suppose youve got all the guns in this part of the country
accounted for too Smoke observed pointedly

Shunk Wilson was angry

Youd think I was the prisoner the way you slam questions into me
Come on with the next witness Wheres French Louis

While French Louis was shoving forward Lucy opened the door

Where you goin Shunk Wilson shouted

I reckon I dont have to stay she answered defiantly I aint got
no vote an besides my cabins so jammed up I cant breathe

In a few minutes her husband followed The closing of the door was the
first warning the judge received of it

Who was that he interrupted Pierres narrative to ask

Bill Peabody somebody spoke up Said he wanted to ask his wife
something and was coming right back

Instead of Bill it was Lucy who reentered took off her furs and
resumed her place by the stove

I reckon we dont need to hear the rest of the witnesses was Shunk
Wilsons decision when Pierre had finished We know they only can
testify to the same facts weve already heard Say Sorensen you go
an bring Bill Peabody back Well be votin a verdict pretty short
Now Stranger you can get up an say your say concernin what
happened In the meantime well just be savin delay by passin around
the two rifles the ammunition an the bullets that done the killin

Midway in his story of how he had arrived in that part of the country
and at the point in his narrative where he described his own ambush and
how he had fled to the bank Smoke was interrupted by the indignant
Shunk Wilson

Young man what sense is there in you testifyin that way Youre
just takin up valuable time Of course you got the right to lie to
save your neck but we aint goin to stand for such foolishness The
rifle the ammunition the bullet that killed Joe Kinade is against
youWhats that Open the door somebody

The frost rushed in taking form and substance in the heat of the room
while through the open door came the whining of dogs that decreased
rapidly with distance

Its Sorensen an Peabody some one cried athrowin the whip into
the dawgs an headin down river

Now what the hell Shunk Wilson paused with dropped jaw and
glared at Lucy I reckon you can explain Mrs Peabody

She tossed her head and compressed her lips and Shunk Wilsons
wrathful and suspicious gaze passed on and rested on Breck

An I reckon that newcomer youve ben chinning with could explain if
HE had a mind to

Breck now very uncomfortable found all eyes centred on him

Sam was chewing the rag with him too before he hit out some one
said

Look here Mr Breck Shunk Wilson continued Youve ben
interruptin proceedings and you got to explain the meanin of it
What was you chinnin about

Breck cleared his throat timidly and replied I was just trying to
buy some grub

What with

Dust of course

Whered you get it

Breck did not answer

Hes ben snoopin around up the Stewart a man volunteered I run
across his camp a week ago when I was huntin An I want to tell you
he was almighty secretious about it

The dust didnt come from there Breck said Thats only a
lowgrade hydraulic proposition

Bring your poke here an lets see your dust Wilson commanded

I tell you it didnt come from there

Lets see it just the same

Breck made as if to refuse but all about him were menacing faces
Reluctantly he fumbled in his coat pocket In the act of drawing
forth a pepper can it rattled against what was evidently a hard object

Fetch it all out Shunk Wilson thundered

And out came the big nugget firstsize yellow as no gold any onlooker
had ever seen Shunk Wilson gasped Half a dozen catching one
glimpse made a break for the door They reached it at the same
moment and with cursing and scuffling jammed and pivoted through
The judge emptied the contents of the pepper can on the table and the
sight of the rough lumpgold sent half a dozen more toward the door

Where are you goin Eli Harding asked as Shunk started to follow

For my dogs of course

Aint you goin to hang him

Itd take too much time right now Hell keep till we get back so I
reckon this court is adjourned This aint no place for lingerin

Harding hesitated He glanced savagely at Smoke saw Pierre beckoning
to Louis from the doorway took one last look at the lumpgold on the
table and decided

No use you tryin to get away he flung back over his shoulder
Besides Im goin to borrow your dogs

What is itanother one of them blamed stampedes the old blind
trapper asked in a queer and petulant falsetto as the cries of men and
dogs and the grind of the sleds swept the silence of the room

It sure is Lucy answered An I never seen gold like it Feel
that old man

She put the big nugget in his hand He was but slightly interested

It was a good furcountry he complained before them danged miners
come in an scared back the game

The door opened and Breck entered

Well he said we four are all that are left in camp Its forty
miles to the Stewart by the cutoff I broke and the fastest of them
cant make the round trip in less than five or six days But its time
you pulled out Smoke just the same

Breck drew his hunting knife across the others bonds and glanced at
the woman

I hope you dont object he said with significant politeness

If theres goin to be any shootin the blind man broke out I wish
somebodyd take me to another cabin first

Go on an dont mind me Lucy answered If I aint good enough to
hang a man I aint good enough to hold him

Smoke stood up rubbing his wrists where the thongs had impeded the
circulation

Ive got a pack all ready for you Breck said Ten days grub
blankets matches tobacco an axe and a rifle

Go to it Lucy encouraged Hit the high places Stranger Beat it
as fast as Godll let you

Im going to have a square meal before I start Smoke said And
when I start it will be up the McQuestion not down I want you to go
along with me Breck Were going to search that other bank for the
man that really did the killing

If youll listen to me youll head down for the Stewart and the
Yukon Breck objected When this gang gets back from my lowgrade
hydraulic proposition it will be seeing red

Smoke laughed and shook his head

I cant jump this country Breck Ive got interests here Ive got
to stay and make good I dont care whether you believe me or not but
Ive found Surprise Lake Thats where that gold came from Besides
they took my dogs and Ive got to wait to get them back Also I know
what Im about There was a man hidden on that bank He came pretty
close to emptying his magazine at me

Half an hour afterward with a big plate of moosesteak before him and
a big mug of coffee at his lips Smoke halfstarted up from his seat
He had heard the sounds first Lucy threw open the door

Hello Spike hello Methody she greeted the two frostrimed men who
were bending over the burden on their sled

We just come down from Upper Camp one said as the pair staggered
into the room with a furwrapped object which they handled with
exceeding gentleness An this is what we found by the way Hes all
in I guess

Put him in the near bunk there Lucy said She bent over and pulled
back the furs disclosing a face composed principally of large
staring black eyes and of skin dark and scabbed by repeated
frostbite tightly stretched across the bones

If it aint Alonzo she cried You pore starved devil

Thats the man on the other bank Smoke said in an undertone to Breck

We found it raidin a cache that Harding must amade one of the men
was explaining He was eatin raw flour an frozen bacon an when we
got m he was cryin an squealin like a hawk Look at him Hes all
starved an most of him frozen Hell kick at any moment

     

Half an hour later when the furs had been drawn over the face of the
still form in the bunk Smoke turned to Lucy

If you dont mind Mrs Peabody Ill have another whack at that steak
Make it thick and not so well done




THE RACE FOR NUMBER ONE




I

Huh Get on to the glad rags

Shorty surveyed his partner with simulated disapproval and Smoke
vainly attempting to rub the wrinkles out of the pair of trousers he
had just put on was irritated

They sure fit you close for a secondhand buy Shorty went on What
was the tax

One hundred and fifty for the suit Smoke answered The man was
nearly my own size I thought it was remarkable reasonable What are
you kicking about

Who Me Oh nothin I was just thinkin it was goin some for a
meateater that hit Dawson in an icejam with no grub one suit of
underclothes a pair of mangy moccasins an overalls that looked like
theyd ben through the wreck of the Hesperus Pretty gay front
pardner Pretty gay front Say

What do you want now Smoke demanded testily

Whats her name

There isnt any her my friend Im to have dinner at Colonel
Bowies if you want to know The trouble with you Shorty is youre
envious because Im going into high society and youre not invited

Aint you some late Shorty queried with concern

What do you mean

For dinner Theyll be eatin supper when you get there

Smoke was about to explain with elaborate sarcasm when he caught the
twinkle in the others eyes He went on dressing with fingers that
had lost their deftness tying a Windsor tie in a bowknot at the
throat of the soft cotton shirt

Wish I hadnt sent all my starched shirts to the laundry Shorty
murmured sympathetically I might afitted you out

By this time Smoke was straining at a pair of shoes The thick woollen
socks were too thick to go into them He looked appealingly at Shorty
who shook his head

Nope If I had thin ones I wouldnt lend em to you Back to the
moccasins pardner Youd sure freeze your toes in skimpyfangled gear
like that

I paid fifteen dollars for them secondhand Smoke lamented

I reckon they wont be a man not in moccasins

But there are to be women Shorty Im going to sit down and eat with
real live womenMrs Bowie and several others so the Colonel told me

Well moccasins wont spoil their appetite none was Shortys
comment Wonder what the Colonel wants with you

I dont know unless hes heard about my finding Surprise Lake It
will take a fortune to drain it and the Guggenheims are out for
investment

Reckon thats it Thats right stick to the moccasins Gee That
coat is sure wrinkled an it fits you a mite too swift Just peck
around at your vittles If you eat hearty youll bust through And if
them womenfolks gets to droppin handkerchiefs just let em lay
Dont do any pickin up Whatever you do dont



II

As became a highsalaried expert and the representative of the great
house of Guggenheim Colonel Bowie lived in one of the most magnificent
cabins in Dawson Of squared logs handhewn it was two stories high
and of such extravagant proportions that it boasted a big living room
that was used for a living room and for nothing else

Here were big bearskins on the rough board floor and on the walls
horns of moose and caribou Here roared an open fireplace and a big
woodburning stove And here Smoke met the social elect of Dawsonnot
the mere pickhandle millionaires but the ultracream of a mining city
whose population had been recruited from all the worldmen like
Warburton Jones the explorer and writer Captain Consadine of the
Mounted Police Haskell Gold Commissioner of the NorthWest Territory
and Baron Von Schroeder an emperors favourite with an international
duelling reputation

And here dazzling in evening gown he met Joy Gastell whom hitherto
he had encountered only on trail befurred and moccasined At dinner he
found himself beside her

I feel like a fish out of water he confessed All you folks are so
real grand you know Besides I never dreamed such oriental luxury
existed in the Klondike Look at Von Schroeder there Hes actually
got a dinner jacket and Consadines got a starched shirt I noticed he
wore moccasins just the same How do you like MY outfit

He moved his shoulders about as if preening himself for Joys approval

It looks as if youd grown stout since you came over the Pass she
laughed

Wrong Guess again

Its somebody elses

You win I bought it for a price from one of the clerks at the A C
Company

Its a shame clerks are so narrowshouldered she sympathized And
you havent told me what you think of MY outfit

I cant he said Im out of breath Ive been living on trail too
long This sort of thing comes to me with a shock you know Id quite
forgotten that women have arms and shoulders Tomorrow morning like
my friend Shorty Ill wake up and know its all a dream Now the
last time I saw you on Squaw Creek

I was just a squaw she broke in

I hadnt intended to say that I was remembering that it was on Squaw
Creek that I discovered you had feet

And I can never forget that you saved them for me she said Ive
been wanting to see you ever since to thank you He shrugged his
shoulders deprecatingly And thats why you are here tonight

You asked the Colonel to invite me

No Mrs Bowie And I asked her to let me have you at table And
heres my chance Everybodys talking Listen and dont interrupt
You know Mono Creek

Yes

It has turned out richdreadfully rich They estimate the claims as
worth a million and more apiece It was only located the other day

I remember the stampede

Well the whole creek was staked to the skyline and all the feeders
too And yet right now on the main creek Number Three below
Discovery is unrecorded The creek was so far away from Dawson that
the Commissioner allowed sixty days for recording after location
Every claim was recorded except Number Three Below It was staked by
Cyrus Johnson And that was all Cyrus Johnson has disappeared
Whether he died whether he went down river or up nobody knows
Anyway in six days the time for recording will be up Then the man
who stakes it and reaches Dawson first and records it gets it

A million dollars Smoke murmured

Gilchrist who has the next claim below has got six hundred dollars
in a single pan off bedrock Hes burned one hole down And the claim
on the other side is even richer I know

But why doesnt everybody know Smoke queried skeptically

Theyre beginning to know They kept it secret for a long time and
it is only now that its coming out Good dogteams will be at a
premium in another twentyfour hours Now youve got to get away as
decently as you can as soon as dinner is over Ive arranged it An
Indian will come with a message for you You read it let on that
youre very much put out make your excuses and get away

IerI fail to follow

Ninny she exclaimed in a halfwhisper What you must do is to get
out tonight and hustle dogteams I know of two Theres Hansons
team seven big Hudson Bay dogshes holding them at four hundred
each Thats top price tonight but it wont be tomorrow And Sitka
Charley has eight Malemutes hes asking thirtyfive hundred for
Tomorrow hell laugh at an offer of five thousand Then youve got
your own team of dogs And youll have to buy several more teams
Thats your work tonight Get the best Its dogs as well as men
that will win this race Its a hundred and ten miles and youll have
to relay as frequently as you can

Oh I see you want me to go in for it Smoke drawled

If you havent the money for the dogs Ill

She faltered but before she could continue Smoke was speaking

I can buy the dogs Buterarent you afraid this is gambling

After your exploits at roulette in the Elkhorn she retorted Im
not afraid that youre afraid Its a sporting proposition if thats
what you mean A race for a million and with some of the stiffest
dogmushers and travellers in the country entered against you They
havent entered yet but by this time tomorrow they will and dogs
will be worth what the richest man can afford to pay Big Olaf is in
town He came up from Circle City last month He is one of the most
terrible dogmushers in the country and if he enters he will be your
most dangerous man Arizona Bill is another Hes been a professional
freighter and mailcarrier for years It he goes in interest will be
centred on him and Big Olaf

And you intend me to come along as a sort of dark horse

Exactly And it will have its advantages You will not be supposed
to stand a show After all you know you are still classed as a
chechaquo You havent seen the four seasons go around Nobody will
take notice of you until you come into the home stretch in the lead

Its on the home stretch the dark horse is to show up its classy form
eh

She nodded and continued earnestly Remember I shall never forgive
myself for the trick I played on the Squaw Creek Stampede until you win
this Mono claim And if any man can win this race against the
oldtimers its you

It was the way she said it He felt warm all over and in his heart
and head He gave her a quick searching look involuntary and
serious and for the moment that her eyes met his steadily ere they
fell it seemed to him that he read something of vaster import than the
claim Cyrus Johnson had failed to record

Ill do it he said Ill win it

The glad light in her eyes seemed to promise a greater need than all
the gold in the Mono claim He was aware of a movement of her hand in
her lap next to his Under the screen of the tablecloth he thrust his
own hand across and met a firm grip of womans fingers that sent
another wave of warmth through him

What will Shorty say was the thought that flashed whimsically
through his mind as he withdrew his hand He glanced almost jealously
at the faces of Von Schroeder and Jones and wondered if they had not
divined the remarkableness and deliciousness of this woman who sat
beside him

He was aroused by her voice and realized that she had been speaking
some moments

So you see Arizona Bill is a white Indian she was saying And Big
Olaf isa bear wrestler a king of the snows a mighty savage He can
outtravel and outendure an Indian and hes never known any other
life but that of the wild and the frost

Whos that Captain Consadine broke in from across the table

Big Olaf she answered I was just telling Mr Bellew what a
traveller he is

Youre right the Captains voice boomed Big Olaf is the greatest
traveller in the Yukon Id back him against Old Nick himself for
snowbucking and icetravel He brought in the government dispatches
in 1895 and he did it after two couriers were frozen on Chilcoot and
the third drowned in the open water of Thirty Mile



III

Smoke had travelled in a leisurely fashion up to Mono Creek fearing to
tire his dogs before the big race Also he had familiarized himself
with every mile of the trail and located his relay camps So many men
had entered the race that the hundred and ten miles of its course was
almost a continuous village Relay camps were everywhere along the
trail Von Schroeder who had gone in purely for the sport had no
less than eleven dog teamsa fresh one for every ten miles Arizona
Bill had been forced to content himself with eight teams Big Olaf had
seven which was the complement of Smoke In addition over twoscore
of other men were in the running Not every day even in the golden
north was a million dollars the prize for a dog race The country had
been swept of dogs No animal of speed and endurance escaped the
finetooth comb that had raked the creeks and camps and the prices of
dogs had doubled and quadrupled in the course of the frantic
speculation

Number Three Below Discovery was ten miles up Mono Creek from its
mouth The remaining hundred miles was to be run on the frozen breast
of the Yukon On Number Three itself were fifty tents and over three
hundred dogs The old stakes blazed and scrawled sixty days before by
Cyrus Johnson still stood and every man had gone over the boundaries
of the claim again and again for the race with dogs was to be preceded
by a foot and obstacle race Each man had to relocate the claim for
himself and this meant that he must place two centrestakes and four
cornerstakes and cross the creek twice before he could start for
Dawson with his dogs

Furthermore there were to be no sooners Not until the stroke of
midnight of Friday night was the claim open for relocation and not
until the stroke of midnight could a man plant a stake This was the
ruling of the Gold Commissioner at Dawson and Captain Consadine had
sent up a squad of mounted police to enforce it Discussion had arisen
about the difference between suntime and policetime but Consadine
had sent forth his fiat that police time went and further that it
was the watch of Lieutenant Pollock that went

The Mono trail ran along the level creekbed and less than two feet
in width was like a groove walled on either side by the snowfall of
months The problem of how fortyodd sleds and three hundred dogs were
to start in so narrow a course was in everybodys mind

Huh said Shorty Its goin to be the goshdangdest mixup that
ever was I cant see no way out Smoke except main strength an
sweat an to plow through If the whole creek was glareice they aint
room for a dozen teams abreast I got a hunch right now theys goin
to be a heap of scrappin before they get strung out An if any of it
comes our way you got to let me do the punchin

Smoke squared his shoulders and laughed noncommittally

No you dont his partner cried in alarm No matter what happens
you dont dast hit You cant handle dogs a hundred miles with a
busted knuckle an thats whatll happen if you land on somebodys
jaw

Smoke nodded his head

Youre right Shorty I couldnt risk the chance

An just remember Shorty went on that I got to do all the shovin
for them first ten miles an you got to take it easy as you can Ill
sure jerk you through to the Yukon After that its up to you an the
dogs Saywhat dye think Schroeders scheme is Hes got his first
team a quarter of a mile down the creek an hell know it by a green
lantern But we got him skinned Me for the red flare every time



IV

The day had been clear and cold but a blanket of cloud formed across
the face of the sky and the night came on warm and dark with the hint
of snow impending The thermometer registered fifteen below zero and
in the Klondikewinter fifteen below is esteemed very warm

At a few minutes before midnight leaving Shorty with the dogs five
hundred yards down the creek Smoke joined the racers on Number Three
There were fortyfive of them waiting the start for the
thousandthousand dollars Cyrus Johnson had left lying in the frozen
gravel Each man carried six stakes and a heavy wooden mallet and was
clad in a smocklike parka of heavy cotton drill

Lieutenant Pollock in a big bearskin coat looked at his watch by the
light of a fire It lacked a minute of midnight

Make ready he said as he raised a revolver in his right hand and
watched the second hand tick around

Fortyfive hoods were thrown back from the parkas Fortyfive pairs of
hands unmittened and fortyfive pairs of moccasins pressed tensely
into the packed snow Also fortyfive stakes were thrust into the
snow and the same number of mallets lifted in the air

The shots rang out and the mallets fell Cyrus Johnsons right to the
million had expired To prevent confusion Lieutenant Pollock had
insisted that the lower centrestake be driven first next the
southeastern and so on around the four sides including the upper
centrestake on the way

Smoke drove in his stake and was away with the leading dozen Fires
had been lighted at the corners and by each fire stood a policeman
list in hand checking off the names of the runners A man was
supposed to call out his name and show his face There was to be no
staking by proxy while the real racer was off and away down the creek

At the first corner beside Smokes stake Von Schroeder placed his
The mallets struck at the same instant As they hammered more arrived
from behind and with such impetuosity as to get in one anothers way
and cause jostling and shoving Squirming through the press and
calling his name to the policeman Smoke saw the Baron struck in
collision by one of the rushers hurled clean off his feet into the
snow But Smoke did not wait Others were still ahead of him By the
light of the vanishing fire he was certain that he saw the back hugely
looming of Big Olaf and at the southwestern corner Big Olaf and he
drove their stakes side by side

It was no light work this preliminary obstacle race The boundaries
of the claim totalled nearly a mile and most of it was over the uneven
surface of a snowcovered niggerhead flat All about Smoke men
tripped and fell and several times he pitched forward himself
jarringly on hands and knees Once Big Olaf fell so immediately in
front of him as to bring him down on top

The upper centrestake was driven by the edge of the bank and down the
bank the racers plunged across the frozen creekbed and up the other
side Here as Smoke clambered a hand gripped his ankle and jerked
him back In the flickering light of a distant fire it was impossible
to see who had played the trick But Arizona Bill who had been
treated similarly rose to his feet and drove his fist with a crunch
into the offenders face Smoke saw and heard as he was scrambling to
his feet but before he could make another lunge for the bank a fist
dropped him halfstunned into the snow He staggered up located the
man halfswung a hook for his jaw then remembered Shortys warning
and refrained The next moment struck below the knees by a hurtling
body he went down again

It was a foretaste of what would happen when the men reached their
sleds Men were pouring over the other bank and piling into the jam
They swarmed up the bank in bunches and in bunches were dragged back
by their impatient fellows More blows were struck curses rose from
the panting chests of those who still had wind to spare and Smoke
curiously visioning the face of Joy Gastell hoped that the mallets
would not be brought into play Overthrown trod upon groping in the
snow for his lost stakes he at last crawled out of the crush and
attacked the bank farther along Others were doing this and it was
his luck to have many men in advance of him in the race for the
northwestern corner

Down to the fourth corner he tripped midway and in the long sprawling
fall lost his remaining stake For five minutes he groped in the
darkness before he found it and all the time the panting runners were
passing him From the last corner to the creek he began overtaking men
for whom the milerun had been too much In the creek itself Bedlam
had broken loose A dozen sleds were piled up and overturned and
nearly a hundred dogs were locked in combat Among them men struggled
tearing the tangled animals apart or beating them apart with clubs
In the fleeting glimpse he caught of it Smoke wondered if he had ever
seen a Dore grotesquery to compare

Leaping down the bank beyond the glutted passage he gained the
hardfooting of the sledtrail and made better time Here in packed
harbours beside the narrow trail sleds and men waited for runners that
were still behind From the rear came the whine and rush of dogs and
Smoke had barely time to leap aside into the deep snow A sled tore
past and he made out the man kneeling and shouting madly Scarcely
was it by when it stopped with a crash of battle The excited dogs of
a harboured sled resenting the passing animals had got out of hand
and sprung upon them

Smoke plunged around and by He could see the green lantern of Von
Schroeder and just below it the red flare that marked his own team
Two men were guarding Schroeders dogs with short clubs interposed
between them and the trail

Come on you Smoke Come on you Smoke he could hear Shorty calling
anxiously

Coming he gasped

By the red flare he could see the snow torn up and trampled and from
the way his partner breathed he knew a battle had been fought He
staggered to the sled and in a moment he was falling on it Shortys
whip snapped as he yelled Mush you devils Mush

The dogs sprang into the breastbands and the sled jerked abruptly
ahead They were big animalsHansons prize team of Hudson Baysand
Smoke had selected them for the first stage which included the ten
miles of Mono the heavygoing of the cutoff across the flat at the
mouth and the first ten miles of the Yukon stretch

How many are ahead he asked

You shut up an save your wind Shorty answered Hi you brutes
Hit her up Hit her up

He was running behind the sled towing on a short rope Smoke could
not see him nor could he see the sled on which he lay at full length
The fires had been left in the rear and they were tearing through a
wall of blackness as fast as the dogs could spring into it This
blackness was almost sticky so nearly did it take on the seeming of
substance

Smoke felt the sled heel up on one runner as it rounded an invisible
curve and from ahead came the snarls of beasts and the oaths of men
This was known afterward as the BarnesSlocum Jam It was the teams of
these two men which first collided and into it at full career piled
Smokes seven big fighters Scarcely more than semidomesticated
wolves the excitement of that night on Mono Creek had sent every dog
fightingmad The Klondike dogs driven without reins cannot be
stopped except by voice so that there was no stopping this glut of
struggle that heaped itself between the narrow rims of the creek From
behind sled after sled hurled into the turmoil Men who had their
teams nearly extricated were overwhelmed by fresh avalanches of
dogseach animal wellfed wellrested and ripe for battle

Its knock down an drag out an plow through Shorty yelled in his
partners ear An watch out for your knuckles You drag out an let
me do the punchin

What happened in the next half hour Smoke never distinctly remembered
At the end he emerged exhausted sobbing for breath his jaw sore from
a firstblow his shoulder aching from the bruise of a club the blood
running warmly down one leg from the rip of a dogs fangs and both
sleeves of his parka torn to shreds As in a dream while the battle
still raged behind he helped Shorty reharness the dogs One dying
they cut from the traces and in the darkness they felt their way to
the repair of the disrupted harnesses

Now you lie down an get your wind back Shorty commanded

And through the darkness the dogs sped with unabated strength down
Mono Creek across the long cutoff and to the Yukon Here at the
junction with the main rivertrail somebody had lighted a fire and
here Shorty said good bye By the light of the fire as the sled
leaped behind the flying dogs Smoke caught another of the
unforgettable pictures of the North Land It was of Shorty swaying
and sinking down limply in the snow yelling his parting encouragement
one eye blackened and closed knuckles bruised and broken and one arm
ripped and fangtorn gushing forth a steady stream of blood



V

How many ahead Smoke asked as he dropped his tired Hudson Bays and
sprang on the waiting sled at the first relay station

I counted eleven the man called after him for he was already away
behind the leaping dogs

Fifteen miles they were to carry him on the next stage which would
fetch him to the mouth of White River There were nine of them but
they composed his weakest team The twentyfive miles between White
River and Sixty Mile he had broken into two stages because of icejams
and here two of his heaviest toughest teams were stationed

He lay on the sled at full length facedown holding on with both
hands Whenever the dogs slacked from topmost speed he rose to his
knees and yelling and urging clinging precariously with one hand
threw his whip into them Poor team that it was he passed two sleds
before White River was reached Here at the freezeup a jam had
piled a barrier allowing the open water that formed for half a mile
below to freeze smoothly This smooth stretch enabled the racers to
make flying exchanges of sleds and down all the course they had placed
their relays below the jams

Over the jam and out on to the smooth Smoke tore along calling
loudly Billy Billy

Billy heard and answered and by the light of the many fires on the
ice Smoke saw a sled swing in from the side and come abreast Its
dogs were fresh and overhauled his As the sleds swerved toward each
other he leaped across and Billy promptly rolled off

Wheres Big Olaf Smoke cried

Leading Billys voice answered and the fires were left behind and
Smoke was again flying through the wall of blackness

In the jams of that relay where the way led across a chaos of upended
icecakes and where Smoke slipped off the forward end of the sled and
with a haulrope toiled behind the wheeldog he passed three sleds
Accidents had happened and he could hear the men cutting out dogs and
mending harnesses

Among the jams of the next short relay into Sixty Mile he passed two
more teams And that he might know adequately what had happened to
them one of his own dogs wrenched a shoulder was unable to keep up
and was dragged in the harness Its teammates angered fell upon it
with their fangs and Smoke was forced to club them off with the heavy
butt of his whip As he cut the injured animal out he heard the
whining cries of dogs behind him and the voice of a man that was
familiar It was Von Schroeder Smoke called a warning to prevent a
rearend collision and the Baron hawing his animals and swinging on
the geepole went by a dozen feet to the side Yet so impenetrable
was the blackness that Smoke heard him pass but never saw him

On the smooth stretch of ice beside the trading post at Sixty Mile
Smoke overtook two more sleds All had just changed teams and for
five minutes they ran abreast each man on his knees and pouring whip
and voice into the maddened dogs But Smoke had studied out that
portion of the trail and now marked the tall pine on the bank that
showed faintly in the light of the many fires Below that pine was not
merely darkness but an abrupt cessation of the smooth stretch There
the trail he knew narrowed to a single sledwidth Leaning out ahead
he caught the haulrope and drew his leaping sled up to the wheeldog
He caught the animal by the hindlegs and threw it With a snarl of
rage it tried to slash him with its fangs but was dragged on by the
rest of the team Its body proved an efficient brake and the two
other teams still abreast dashed ahead into the darkness for the
narrow way

Smoke heard the crash and uproar of their collision released his
wheeler sprang to the geepole and urged his team to the right into
the soft snow where the straining animals wallowed to their necks It
was exhausting work but he won by the tangled teams and gained the
hardpacked trail beyond



VI

On the relay out of Sixty Mile Smoke had next to his poorest team and
though the going was good he had set it a short fifteen miles Two
more teams would bring him in to Dawson and to the GoldRecorders
office and Smoke had selected his best animals for the last two
stretches Sitka Charley himself waited with the eight Malemutes that
would jerk Smoke along for twenty miles and for the finish with a
fifteenmile run was his own teamthe team he had had all winter and
which had been with him in the search for Surprise Lake

The two men he had left entangled at Sixty Mile failed to overtake him
and on the other hand his team failed to overtake any of the three
that still led His animals were willing though they lacked stamina
and speed and little urging was needed to keep them jumping into it at
their best There was nothing for Smoke to do but to lie facedownward
and hold on Now and again he would plunge out of the darkness into
the circle of light about a blazing fire catch a glimpse of furred men
standing by harnessed and waiting dogs and plunge into the darkness
again Mile after mile with only the grind and jar of the runners in
his ears he sped on Almost automatically he kept his place as the
sled bumped ahead or halflifted and heeled on the swings and swerves
of the bends First one and then another without apparent rhyme or
reason three faces limned themselves on his consciousness Joy
Gastells laughing and audacious Shortys battered and exhausted by
the struggle down Mono Creek and John Bellews seamed and rigid as
if cast in iron so unrelenting was its severity And sometimes Smoke
wanted to shout aloud to chant a paean of savage exultation as he
remembered the office of the Billow and the serial story of San
Francisco which he had left unfinished along with the other fripperies
of those empty days

The grey twilight of morning was breaking as he exchanged his weary
dogs for the eight fresh Malemutes Lighter animals than Hudson Bays
they were capable of greater speed and they ran with the supple
tirelessness of true wolves Sitka Charley called out the order of the
teams ahead Big Olaf led Arizona Bill was second and Von Schroeder
third These were the three best men in the country In fact ere
Smoke had left Dawson the popular betting had placed them in that
order While they were racing for a million at least half a million
had been staked by others on the outcome of the race No one had bet
on Smoke who despite his several known exploits was still accounted
a chechaquo with much to learn

As daylight strengthened Smoke caught sight of a sled ahead and in
half an hour his own leaddog was leaping at its tail Not until the
man turned his head to exchange greetings did Smoke recognize him as
Arizona Bill Von Schroeder had evidently passed him The trail
hardpacked ran too narrowly through the soft snow and for another
halfhour Smoke was forced to stay in the rear Then they topped an
icejam and struck a smooth stretch below where were a number of relay
camps and where the snow was packed widely On his knees swinging his
whip and yelling Smoke drew abreast He noted that Arizona Bills
right arm hung dead at his side and that he was compelled to pour
leather with his left hand Awkward as it was he had no hand left
with which to hold on and frequently he had to cease from the whip and
clutch to save himself from falling off Smoke remembered the
scrimmage in the creek bed at Three Below Discovery and understood
Shortys advice had been sound

Whats happened Smoke asked as he began to pull ahead

I dont know Arizona Bill answered I think I threw my shoulder
out in the scrapping

He dropped behind very slowly though when the last relay station was
in sight he was fully half a mile in the rear Ahead bunched
together Smoke could see Big Olaf and Von Schroeder Again Smoke
arose to his knees and he lifted his jaded dogs into a burst of speed
such as a man only can who has the proper instinct for dogdriving He
drew up close to the tail of Von Schroeders sled and in this order
the three sleds dashed out on the smooth going below a jam where many
men and many dogs waited Dawson was fifteen miles away

Von Schroeder with his tenmile relays had changed five miles back
and would change five miles ahead So he held on keeping his dogs at
full leap Big Olaf and Smoke made flying changes and their fresh
teams immediately regained what had been lost to the Baron Big Olaf
led past and Smoke followed into the narrow trail beyond

Still good but not so good Smoke paraphrased Spencer to himself

Of Von Schroeder now behind he had no fear but ahead was the
greatest dogdriver in the country To pass him seemed impossible
Again and again many times Smoke forced his leader to the others
sledtrail and each time Big Olaf let out another link and drew away
Smoke contented himself with taking the pace and hung on grimly The
race was not lost until one or the other won and in fifteen miles many
things could happen

Three miles from Dawson something did happen To Smokes surprise Big
Olaf rose up and with oaths and leather proceeded to fetch out the last
ounce of effort in his animals It was a spurt that should have been
reserved for the last hundred yards instead of being begun three miles
from the finish Sheer dogkilling that it was Smoke followed His
own team was superb No dogs on the Yukon had had harder work or were
in better condition Besides Smoke had toiled with them and eaten
and bedded with them and he knew each dog as an individual and how
best to win in to the animals intelligence and extract its last least
shred of willingness

They topped a small jam and struck the smoothgoing below Big Olaf
was barely fifty feet ahead A sled shot out from the side and drew in
toward him and Smoke understood Big Olafs terrific spurt He had
tried to gain a lead for the change This fresh team that waited to
jerk him down the home stretch had been a private surprise of his
Even the men who had backed him to win had had no knowledge of it

Smoke strove desperately to pass during the exchange of sleds Lifting
his dogs to the effort he ate up the intervening fifty feet With
urging and pouring of leather he went to the side and on until his
leaddog was jumping abreast of Big Olafs wheeler On the other side
abreast was the relay sled At the speed they were going Big Olaf
did not dare the flying leap If he missed and fell off Smoke would
be in the lead and the race would be lost

Big Olaf tried to spurt ahead and he lifted his dogs magnificently
but Smokes leader still continued to jump beside Big Olafs wheeler
For half a mile the three sleds tore and bounced along side by side
The smooth stretch was nearing its end when Big Olaf took the chance
As the flying sleds swerved toward each other he leaped and the
instant he struck he was on his knees with whip and voice spurting the
fresh team The smooth pinched out into the narrow trail and he
jumped his dogs ahead and into it with a lead of barely a yard

A man was not beaten until he was beaten was Smokes conclusion and
drive no matter how Big Olaf failed to shake him off No team Smoke
had driven that night could have stood such a killing pace and kept up
with fresh dogsno team save this one Nevertheless the pace WAS
killing it and as they began to round the bluff at Klondike City he
could feel the pitch of strength going out of his animals Almost
imperceptibly they lagged and foot by foot Big Olaf drew away until he
led by a score of yards

A great cheer went up from the population of Klondike City assembled on
the ice Here the Klondike entered the Yukon and half a mile away
across the Klondike on the north bank stood Dawson An outburst of
madder cheering arose and Smoke caught a glimpse of a sled shooting
out to him He recognized the splendid animals that drew it They
were Joy Gastells And Joy Gastell drove them The hood of her
squirrelskin parka was tossed back revealing the cameolike oval of
her face outlined against her heavilymassed hair Mittens had been
discarded and with bare hands she clung to whip and sled

Jump she cried as her leader snarled at Smokes

Smoke struck the sled behind her It rocked violently from the impact
of his body but she was full up on her knees and swinging the whip

Hi You Mush on Chook Chook she was crying and the dogs
whined and yelped in eagerness of desire and effort to overtake Big
Olaf

And then as the leaddog caught the tail of Big Olafs sled and yard
by yard drew up abreast the great crowd on the Dawson bank went mad
It WAS a great crowd for the men had dropped their tools on all the
creeks and come down to see the outcome of the race and a dead heat at
the end of a hundred and ten miles justified any madness

When youre in the lead Im going to drop off Joy cried out over her
shoulder

Smoke tried to protest

And watch out for the dip curve half way up the bank she warned

Dog by dog separated by half a dozen feet the two teams were running
abreast Big Olaf with whip and voice held his own for a minute
Then slowly an inch at a time Joys leader began to forge past

Get ready she cried to Smoke Im going to leave you in a minute
Get the whip

And as he shifted his hand to clutch the whip they heard Big Olaf roar
a warning but too late His leaddog incensed at being passed
swerved in to the attack His fangs struck Joys leader on the flank
The rival teams flew at one anothers throats The sleds overran the
fighting brutes and capsized Smoke struggled to his feet and tried to
lift Joy up But she thrust him from her crying Go

On foot already fifty feet in advance was Big Olaf still intent on
finishing the race Smoke obeyed and when the two men reached the
foot of the Dawson bank he was at the others heels But up the bank
Big Olaf lifted his body hugely regaining a dozen feet

Five blocks down the main street was the Gold Recorders office The
street was packed as for the witnessing of a parade Not so easily
this time did Smoke gain to his giant rival and when he did he was
unable to pass Side by side they ran along the narrow aisle between
the solid walls of furclad cheering men Now one now the other
with great convulsive jerks gained an inch or so only to lose it
immediately after

If the pace had been a killing one for their dogs the one they now set
themselves was no less so But they were racing for a million dollars
and great honour in Yukon Country The only outside impression that
came to Smoke on that last mad stretch was one of astonishment that
there should be so many people in the Klondike He had never seen them
all at once before

He felt himself involuntarily lag and Big Olaf sprang a full stride in
the lead To Smoke it seemed that his heart would burst while he had
lost all consciousness of his legs He knew they were flying under
him but he did not know how he continued to make them fly nor how he
put even greater pressure of will upon them and compelled them again to
carry him to his giant competitors side

The open door of the Recorders office appeared ahead of them Both
men made a final futile spurt Neither could draw away from the
other and side by side they hit the doorway collided violently and
fell headlong on the office floor

They sat up but were too exhausted to rise Big Olaf the sweat
pouring from him breathing with tremendous painful gasps pawed the
air and vainly tried to speak Then he reached out his hand with
unmistakable meaning Smoke extended his and they shook

Its a dead heat Smoke could hear the Recorder saying but it was as
if in a dream and the voice was very thin and very far away And all
I can say is that you both win Youll have to divide the claim
between you Youre partners

Their two arms pumped up and down as they ratified the decision Big
Olaf nodded his head with great emphasis and spluttered At last he
got it out

You damn chechaquo was what he said but in the saying of it was
admiration I dont know how you done it but you did

Outside the great crowd was noisily massed while the office was
packing and jamming Smoke and Big Olaf essayed to rise and each
helped the other to his feet Smoke found his legs weak under him and
staggered drunkenly Big Olaf tottered toward him

Im sorry my dogs jumped yours

It couldnt be helped Smoke panted back I heard you yell

Say Big Olaf went on with shining eyes That girlone damn fine
girl eh

One damn fine girl Smoke agreed
