Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we do NOT keep these books
in compliance with any particular paper edition usually otherwise


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates for time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a

Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtytwo text
files per month or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 10 of the present number of computer users 2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that so it
will require us reaching less than 5 of the users in 2001

A COMEDY IN TWO ACTS

BY J M SYNGE


JOHN W LUCE AND COMPANY
BOSTON          1911





Copyright 1904
By J M Synge





PREFACE

THE drama is made serious  in the French
sense of the word  not by the degree in
which it is taken up with problems that are
serious in themselves but by the degree in
which it gives the nourishment not very easy
to define on which our imaginations live We
should not go to the theatre as we go to a
chemists or a dramshop but as we go to
a dinner where the food we need is taken
with pleasure and excitement This was
nearly always so in Spain and England and
France when the drama was at its richest 
the infancy and decay of the drama tend to
be didactic  but in these days the playhouse
is too often stocked with the drugs of many


VI

seedy problems or with the absinthe or ver
mouth of the last musical comedy
 The drama like the symphony does not
teach or prove anything Analysts with their
problems and teachers with their systems are
soon as oldfashioned as the pharmacopoeligia of
Galen  look at Ibsen and the Germans  but
the best plays of Ben Jonson and Moliegravere can
no more go out of fashion than the black
berries on the hedges
 Of the things which nourish the imagination
humour is one of the most needful and it is
dangerous to limit or destroy it Baudelaire
calls laughter the greatest sign of the Satanic
element in man and where a country loses
its humor as some towns in Ireland are doing
there will be morbidity of mind as Baude
laires mind was morbid
 In the greater part of Ireland however
the whole people from the tinkers to the
clergy have still a life and view of life that


VII

are rich and genial and humorous I do not
think that these country people who have so
much humor themselves will mind being
laughed at without malice as the people in
every country have been laughed at in their
own comedies

your talk of getting married and your driv
ing me to it and I not asking it at all
 iSarah turns her back to him and ar
 ranges something in the ditchi
 MICHAEL  iangrilyi  Cant you speak

back wood to get two of Tim Flahertys hens
are roosting in the ashtree above at the well
 MARY And its leaving me lone you are
Come back here Sarah Casey Come back
here Im saying or if its off you must go
leave me the two little coppers you have the
way I can walk up in a short while and get
another pint for my sleep
 SARAH Its too much you have taken
Let you stretch yourself out and take a long
sleep for isnt that the best thing any woman
can do and she an old drinking heathen like
yourself
 iShe and Michael go out lefti
 MARY  istanding up slowlyi  Its gone
they are and I with my feet that weak under
me youd knock me down with a rush and
my head with a noise in it the like of what


31

youd hear in a stream and it running between
two rocks and rain falling iShe goes over to
the ditch where the can is tied in sacking and
takes it downi What good am I this night
God help me What good are the grand
stories I have when its few would listen to
an old woman few but a girl maybe would
be in great fear the time her hour was come
or a little child wouldnt be sleeping with the
hunger on a cold night iShe takes the can
from the sacking and fits in three empty bottles
and straw in its place and ties them upi
Maybe the two of them have a good right to
be walking out the little short while theyd be
young but if they have itself theyll not
keep Mary Byrne from her full pint when
the nights fine and theres a dry moon in the
sky iShe takes up the can and puts the
package back in the ditchi Jemmy Neills a
decent lad and hell give me a good drop for
the can and maybe if I keep near the peelers
tomorrow for the first bit of the fair herself
wont strike me at all and if she does itself
whats a little stroke on your head beside
sitting lonesome on a fine night hearing the


32

dogs barking and the bats squeaking and you
saying over its a short while only till you die
 iShe goes out singing The night before
 Larry was stretchedi

me its the like of that they do
 iMary yawns and turns over in her
 sleepi
 SARAH  iwith anxietyi  There she is
waking up on us and I thinking wed have the
job done before shed know of it at all


34

 MICHAEL Shell be crying out now and
making game of us and saying its fools we
are surely
 SARAH Ill send her to sleep again or
get her out of it one way or another for itd
be a bad case to have a divils scholar the like
of her turning the priest against us maybe
with her godless talk
 MARY  iwaking up and looking at them
with curiosity blandlyi  Thats fine things
you have on you Sarah Casey and its a great
stir youre making this day washing your
face Im that used to the hammer I wouldnt
hear it at all but washing is a rare thing and
youre after waking me up and I having a
great sleep in the sun
 iShe looks around cautiously at the
 bundle in which she has hidden the
 bottlesi
 SARAH  icoaxinglyi  Let you stretch
out again for a sleep Mary Byrne for itll
be a middling time yet before we go to the
fair
 MARY  iwith suspicioni  Thats a sweet
tongue you have Sarah Casey but if sleeps
a grand thing its a grand thing to be waking
up a day the like of this when theres a warm
sun in it and a kind air and youll hear the


35

cuckoos singing and crying out on the top of
the hills
 SARAH If its that gay you are youd
have a right to walk down and see would you
get a few halfpence from the rich men do be
driving early to the fair
 MARY When rich men do be driving
early its queer tempers they have the Lord
forgive them the way its little but bad words
and swearing out youd get from them all
 SARAH  ilosing her temper and breaking
out fiercelyi  Then if youll neither beg nor
sleep let you walk off from this place where
youre not wanted and not have us waiting
for you maybe at the turn of day
 MARY  irather uneasy turning to Mi
chaeli  God help our spirits Michael there
she is again rousing cranky from the break
of dawn Oh isnt she a terror since the
moon did change ishe gets up slowlyi And
Id best be going forward to sell the gallon
can
 iShe goes over and takes up the bundlei
 SARAH  icrying out angrilyi  Leave
that down Mary Byrne Oh arent you the
scorn of women to think that youd have that
drouth and roguery on you that youd go
drinking the can and the dew not dried from
the grass


36

 MARY  iin a feigned tone of pacification
with the bundle still in her handi  Its not a
drouth but a heartburn I have this day Sarah
Casey so Im going down to cool my gullet
at the blessed well and Ill sell the can to the
parsons daughter below a harmless poor
creature would fill your hand with shillings
for a brace of lies
 SARAH Leave down the tin can Mary
Byrne for I hear the drouth upon your tongue
today
 MARY Theres not a drinkhouse from
this place to the fair Sarah Casey the way
youll find me below with the full price and
not a farthing gone
 iShe turns to go off lefti
 SARAH  ijumping up and picking up the
hammer threateninglyi  Put down that can
Im saying
 MARY  ilooking at her for a moment in
terror and putting down the bundle in the
ditchi  Is it raving mad youre going Sarah
Casey and you the pride of women to destroy
the world
 SARAH  igoing up to her and giving her
a push off lefti  Ill show you if its raving
mad I am Go on from this place Im saying
and be wary now
 MARY  iturning back after heri  If I


37

go Ill be telling old and young youre a
weathered heathen savage Sarah Casey the
one did put down a head of the parsons cab
bage to boil in the pot with your clothes ithe
priest comes in behind her on the left and
listensi and quenched the flaming candles on
the throne of God the time your shadow fell
within the pillars of the chapel door
 iSarah turns on her and she springs
 round nearly into the Priests arms
 When she sees him she claps her shawl
 over her mouth and goes up towards
 the ditch laughing to herselfi
 PRIEST  igoing to Sarah half terrified
at the language that he has heardi  Well
arent you a fearful lot Im thinking its only
humbug you were making at the fall of night
and you wont need me at all
 SARAH  iwith anger still in her voicei 
Humbug is it would you be turning back upon
your spoken promise in the face of God
 PRIEST  idubiouslyi  Im thinking you
were never christened Sarah Casey and it
would be a queer job to go dealing Christian
sacraments unto the like of you iPersuasive
ly feeling in his pocketi So it would be best
maybe Id give you a shilling for to drink
my health and let you walk on and not
trouble me at all


38

 SARAH Thats your talking is it If
you dont stand to your spoken word holy
father Ill make my own complaint to the
mitred bishop in the face of all
 PRIEST Youd do that
 SARAH I would surely holy father if
I walked to the city of Dublin with blood and
blisters on my naked feet
 PRIEST  iuneasily scratching his eari 
I wish this day was done Sarah Casey for
Im thinking its a risky thing getting mixed
up in any matters with the like of you
 SARAH Be hasty then and youll have
us done with before youd think at all
 PRIEST  igiving ini  Well maybe its
right you are and let you come up to the chapel
when you see me looking from the door
 iHe goes up into the chapeli
 SARAH  icalling after himi  We will
and God preserve you holy father
 MARY  icoming down to them speaking
with amazement and consternation but with
out angeri  Going to the chapel Its at mar
riage youre fooling again maybe iSarah
turns her back on heri It was for that you
were washing your face and you after sending
me for porter at the fall of night the way Id
drink a good half from the jug iGoingi


39

iround in front of Sarahi Is it at marriage
youre fooling again
 SARAH  itriumphantlyi  It is Mary
Byrne Ill be married now in a short while
and from this day there will no one have a
right to call me a dirty name and I selling cans
in Wicklow or Wexford or the city of Dublin
itself
 MARY  iturning to Michaeli  And its
yourself is wedding her Michael Byrne
 MICHAEL  igloomilyi  It is God spare
us
 MARY  ilooks at Sarah for a moment
and then bursts out into a laugh of derisioni 
Well shes a tight hardy girl and its no lie
but I never knew till this day it was a black
born fool I had for a son Youll breed asses
Ive heard them say and poaching dogs and
horsesd go licking the wind but its a hard
thing God help me to breed sense in a son
 MICHAEL  igloomilyi  If I didnt mar
ry her shed be walking off to Jaunting Jim
maybe at the fall of night and its well your
self knows there isnt the like of her for getting
money and selling songs to the men
 MARY And youre thinking its paying
gold to his reverence would make a woman
stop when shes a mind to go
 SARAH  iangrilyi  Let you not be de


40

stroying us with your talk when Ive as good
a right to a decent marriage as any speckled
female does be sleeping in the black hovels
above would choke a mule
 MARY  isoothinglyi  Its as good a right
you have surely Sarah Casey but what good
will it do Is it putting that ring on your
finger will keep you from getting an aged
woman and losing the fine face you have or
be easing your pains when its the grand ladies
do be married in silk dresses with rings of
gold that do pass any woman with their share
of torment in the hour of birth and do be
paying the doctors in the city of Dublin a great
price at that time the like of what youd pay
for a good ass and a cart
 iShe sits downi
 SARAH  ipuzzledi  Is that the truth
 MARY  ipleased with the point she has
madei  Wouldnt any know its the truth
Ah its a few short years you are yet in the
world Sarah Casey and its little or nothing
at all maybe you know about it
 SARAH  ivehement but uneasyi  What
is it yourself knows of the fine ladies when
they wouldnt let the like of you go near them
at all
 MARY If you do be drinking a little sup
in one town and another town its soon you


41

get great knowledge and a great sight into
the world Youll see men there and women
there sitting up on the ends of barrels in the
dark night and they making great talk would
soon have the like of you Sarah Casey as
wise as a March hare
 MICHAEL  ito Sarahi  Thats the truth
shes saying and maybe if youve sense in you
at all youd have a right still to leave your
fooling and not be wasting our gold
 SARAH  idecisivelyi  If its wise or fool
I am Ive made a good bargain and Ill stand
to it now
 MARY What is it hes making you give
 MICHAEL The ten shillings in gold and
the tin can is above tied in the sack
 MARY  ilooking at the bundle with sur
prise and dreadi  The bit of gold and the
tin can is it
 MICHAEL The half a sovereign and the
gallon can
 MARY  iscrambling to her feet quicklyi 
Well I think Ill be walking off the road to
the fair the way you wont be destroying me
going too fast on the hills iShe goes a few
steps towards the left then turns and speaks
to Sarah very persuasivelyi  Let you not take
the can from the sack Sarah Casey for the
people is coming above would be making game


42

of you and pointing their fingers if they seen
you do the like of that Let you leave it safe
in the bag Im saying Sarah darling Its
that way will be best
 iShe goes towards left and pauses for a
 moment looking about her with em
 barrassmenti
 MICHAEL  iin a low voicei  What ails
her at all
 SARAH  ianxiouslyi  Its real wicked
she does be when you hear her speaking as
easy as that
 MARY  ito herselfi  Id be safer in the
chapel Im thinking for if she caught me
after on the road maybe she would kill me
then
 iShe comes hobbling back towards the
 righti
 SARAH Where is it youre going It
isnt that way well be walking to the fair
 MARY Im going up into the chapel to
give you my blessing and hear the priest
saying his prayers Its a lonesome road is
running below to Greenane and a woman
would never know the things might happen
her and she walking single in a lonesome place
 iAs she reaches the chapelgate the
 Priest comes to it in his surplicei
 PRIEST  icrying outi  Come along now


43

It is the whole day youd keep me here saying
my prayers and I getting my death with not
a bit in my stomach and my breakfast in ruins
and the Lord Bishop maybe driving on the
road today
 SARAH Were coming now holy father
 PRIEST Give me the bit of gold into my
hand
 SARAH Its here holy father
 iShe gives it to him Michael takes the
 bundle from the ditch and brings it
 over standing a little behind Sarah
 He feels the bundle and looks at Mary
 with a meaning looki
 PRIEST  ilooking at the goldi  Its a
good one Im thinking wherever you got it
And where is the can
 SARAH  itaking the bundlei  We have
it here in a bit of clean sack your reverence
We tied it up in the inside of that to keep it
from rusting in the dews of night and let you
not open it now or youll have the people
making game of us and telling the story on
us east and west to the butt of the hills
 PRIEST  itaking the bundlei  Give it
here into my hand Sarah Casey What is it
any person would think of a tinker making a
 can iHe begins opening the bundlei
 SARAH Its a fine can your reverence


44

for if its poor simple people we are its fine
cans we can make and himself God help him
is a great man surely at the trade
 iPriest opens the bundle the three empty
 bottles fall outi
 SARAH Glory to the saints of joy
 PRIEST Did ever any man see the like
of that To think youd be putting deceit
on me and telling lies to me and I going to
marry you for a little sum wouldnt marry a
child
 SARAH  icrestfallen and astonishedi 
Its the divil did it your reverence and I
wouldnt tell you a lie iRaising her handsi
May the Lord Almighty strike me dead if the
divil isnt after hooshing the tin can from the
bag
 PRIEST  ivehementlyi  Go along now
and dont be swearing your lies Go along
now and let you not be thinking Im big fool
enough to believe the like of that when its
after selling it you are or making a swap for
drink of it maybe in the darkness of the night
 MARY  iin a peacemaking voice putting
her hand on the Priests left armi  She
wouldnt do the like of that your reverence
when she hasnt a decent standing drouth on
her at all and shes setting great store on her
marriage the way youd have a right to be


45

taking her easy and not minding the can
What differ would an empty can make with
a fine rich hardy man the like of you
 SARAH  iimploringlyi  Marry us your
reverence for the ten shillings in gold and
well make you a grand can in the evening 
a can would be fit to carry water for the holy
man of God Marry us now and Ill be saying
fine prayers for you morning and night if

pools Id be setting my knees
 PRIEST  iloudlyi  Its a wicked thiev
ing lying scheming lot you are the pack of
you Let you walk off now and take every
stinking rag you have there from the ditch
 MARY  iputting her shawl over her headi
Marry her your reverence for the love of
God for therell be queer doings below if you
send her off the like of that and she swearing
crazy on the road
 SARAH  iangrilyi  Its the truth shes
saying for its herself Im thinking is after
swapping the tin can for a pint the time she
was raging mad with the drouth and our
selves above walking the hill
 MARY  icrying out with indignationi 
Have you no shame Sarah Casey to tell lies
unto a holy man
 SARAH  ito Mary working herself intoi


46

and putting a fools head on me in the face
of the world but if you were thinking to be
mighty cute walking off or going up to hide
in the church Ive got you this time and
youll not run from me now
 iShe seizes up one of the bottlesi
 MARY  ihiding behind the priesti  Keep
her off your reverence keep her off for the
love of the Almighty God What at all would
the Lord Bishop say if he found me here
lying with my head broken across or the two
of yous maybe digging a bloody grave for
me at the door of the church
 PRIEST  iwaving Sarah offi  Go along
Sarah Casey Would you be doing murder at
my feet Go along from me now and wasnt
I a big fool to have to do with you when its
nothing but distraction and torment I get
from the kindness of my heart
 SARAH  ishoutingi  Ive bet a power of
strong lads east and west through the world
and are you thinking Id turn back from a
priest Leave the road now or maybe I
would strike yourself
 PRIEST You would not Sarah Casey
Ive no fear for the lot of you but let you
walk off Im saying and not be coming where


47

youve no business and screeching tumult and
murder at the doorway of the church
 SARAH Ill not go a step till I have her
head broke or till Im wed with himself If
you want to get shut of us let you marry us
now for Im thinking the ten shillings in gold
is a good price for the like of you and you
near burst with the fat
 PRIEST I wouldnt have you coming in
on me and soiling my church for theres
nothing at all Im thinking would keep the
like of you from hell iHe throws down the
ten shillings on the groundi Gather up your
gold now and begone from my sight for if
ever I set an eye on you again youll hear me
telling the peelers who it was stole the black
ass belonging to Philly OCullen and whose
hay it is the grey ass does be eating
 SARAH Youd do that
 PRIEST I would surely
 SARAH If you do youll be getting all
the tinkers from Wicklow and Wexford and
the County Meath to put up block tin in the
place of glass to shield your windows where
you do be looking out and blinking at the girls
Its hard set youll be that time Im telling
you to fill the depth of your belly the long
days of Lent for we wouldnt leave a laying
pullet in your yard at all


48

 PRIEST  ilosing his temper finallyi  Go
on now or Ill send the Lords of Justice a
dated story of your villainies  burning
stealing robbing raping to this mortal day
Go on now Im saying if youd run from
Kilmainham or the rope itself
 MICHAEL  itaking off his coati  Is it
run from the like of you holy father Go up
to your own shanty or Ill beat you with the
asss reins till the world would hear you roar
ing from this place to the coast of Clare
 PRIEST Is it lift your hand upon myself
when the Lord would blight your members
if youd touch me now Go on from this
 iHe gives him a shovei
 MICHAEL Blight me is it Take it
then your reverence and God help you so
 iHe runs at him with the reinsi
 PRIEST  iruns up to ditch crying outi 
There are the peelers passing by the grace of
God  hey below
 MARY  iclapping her hand over his
mouthi  Knock him down on the road they
didnt hear him at all
 iMichael pulls him downi
 SARAH Gag his jaws
 MARY Stuff the sacking in his teeth
 iThey gag him with the sack that had
 the can in iti


49

 SARAH Tie the bag around his head
and if the peelers come well put him head
first in the boghole is beyond the ditch
 iThey tie him up in some sackingi
 MICHAEL  ito Maryi  Keep him quiet
and the rags tight on him for fear hed
screech iHe goes back to their campi
Hurry with the things Sarah Casey The
peelers arent coming this way and maybe
well get off from them now
 iThey bundle the things together in
 wild haste the priest wriggling and
 struggling about on the ground with
 old Mary trying to keep him quieti
 MARY  ipatting his headi  Be quiet
your reverence What is it ails you with
your wrigglings now Is it choking maybe
iShe puts her hand under the sack and feels
his mouth patting him on the backi Its
only letting on you are holy father for your
nose is blowing back and forward as easy as
an east wind on an April day iIn a soothing
voicei There now holy father let you stay
easy Im telling you and learn a little sense
and patience the way youll not be so airy
again going to rob poor sinners of their scraps
of gold iHe gets quieteri Thats a good
boy you are now your reverence and let you
not be uneasy for we wouldnt hurt you at


50

all Its sick and sorry we are to tease you
but what did you want meddling with the
like of us when its a long time we are going
our own ways  father and son and his son
after him or mother and daughter and her
own daughter again  and its little need we
ever had of going up into a church and swear
ing  Im told theres swearing with it  a
word no man would believe or with drawing
rings on our fingers would be cutting our
skins maybe when wed be taking the ass from
the shafts and pulling the straps the time
theyd be slippy with going around beneath
the heavens in rains falling
 MICHAEL  iwho has finished bundling
up the things comes over to Sarahi  Were
fixed now and I have a mind to run him in
a boghole the way hell not be tattling to the
peelers of our games today
 SARAH Youd have a right too Im
thinking
 MARY  isoothinglyi  Let you not be
rough with him Sarah Casey and he after
drinking his sup of porter with us at the fall
of night Maybe hed swear a mighty oath
he wouldnt harm us and then wed safer
loose him for if we went to drown him
theyd maybe hang the batch of us man and
child and woman and the ass itself


51

 MICHAEL What would he care for an
oath
 MARY Dont you know his like do live
in terror of the wrath of God iPutting her
mouth to the Priests ear in the sackingi
Would you swear an oath holy father to
leave us in our freedom and not talk at all
iPriest nods in sackingi Didnt I tell you
Look at the poor fellow nodding his head off
in the bias of the sacks Strip them off from
him and hell be easy now
 MICHAEL  ias if speaking to a horsei 
Hold up holy father
 iHe pulls the sacking off and shows the
 priest with his hair on end They free
 his mouthi
 MARY Hold him till he swears
 PRIEST  iin a faint voicei  I swear
surely If you let me go in peace Ill not
inform against you or say a thing at all and
may God forgive me for giving heed unto
your like today
 SARAH  iputs the ring on his fingeri 
Theres the ring holy father to keep you
minding of your oath until the end of time
for my hearts scalded with your fooling and
itll be a long day till I go making talk of
marriage or the like of that
 MARY  icomplacently standing up slowi


52

ilyi  Shes vexed now your reverence and
let you not mind her at all for shes right
surely and its little need we ever had of the
like of you to get us our bit to eat and our
bit to drink and our time of love when we
were young men and women and were fine
to look at
 MICHAEL Hurry on now Hes a great
man to have kept us from fooling our gold
and well have a great time drinking that bit
with the trampers on the green of Clash
 iThey gather up their things The priest
 stands upi
 PRIEST  ilifting up his handi  Ive
sworn not to call the hand of man upon your
crimes today but I havent sworn I wouldnt
call the fire of heaven from the hand of the
Almighty God
 iHe begins saying a Latin malediction in
 a loud ecclesiastical voicei
 MARY Theres an old villain
 All  itogetheri  Run run Run for
your lives
 iThey rush out leaving the Priest master
 of the situationi
