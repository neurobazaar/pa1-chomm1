THE PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN WORLD

A COMEDY IN THREE ACTS


By J M Synge




PREFACE

In writing THE PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN WORLD as in my other plays I
have used one or two words only that I have not heard among the country
people of Ireland or spoken in my own nursery before I could read the
newspapers A certain number of the phrases I employ I have heard also
from herds and fishermen along the coast from Kerry to Mayo or
from beggarwomen and balladsingers nearer Dublin and I am glad to
acknowledge how much I owe to the folk imagination of these fine people
Anyone who has lived in real intimacy with the Irish peasantry will
know that the wildest sayings and ideas in this play are tame indeed
compared with the fancies one may hear in any little hillside cabin in
Geesala or Carraroe or Dingle Bay All art is a collaboration and
there is little doubt that in the happy ages of literature striking
and beautiful phrases were as ready to the storytellers or the
playwrights hand as the rich cloaks and dresses of his time It is
probable that when the Elizabethan dramatist took his inkhorn and sat
down to his work he used many phrases that he had just heard as he sat
at dinner from his mother or his children In Ireland those of us who
know the people have the same privilege When I was writing The Shadow
of the Glen some years ago I got more aid than any learning could
have given me from a chink in the floor of the old Wicklow house where
I was staying that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls
in the kitchen This matter I think is of importance for in countries
where the imagination of the people and the language they use is rich
and living it is possible for a writer to be rich and copious in his
words and at the same time to give the reality which is the root
of all poetry in a comprehensive and natural form In the modern
literature of towns however richness is found only in sonnets or
prose poems or in one or two elaborate books that are far away from the
profound and common interests of life One has on one side Mallarme
and Huysmans producing this literature and on the other Ibsen and Zola
dealing with the reality of life in joyless and pallid words On the
stage one must have reality and one must have joy and that is why the
intellectual modern drama has failed and people have grown sick of the
false joy of the musical comedy that has been given them in place of
the rich joy found only in what is superb and wild in reality In a good
play every speech should be as fully flavoured as a nut or apple and
such speeches cannot be written by anyone who works among people who
have shut their lips on poetry In Ireland for a few years more we
have a popular imagination that is fiery and magnificent and tender so
that those of us who wish to write start with a chance that is not given
to writers in places where the springtime of the local life has been
forgotten and the harvest is a memory only and the straw has been
turned into bricks J M S January 21st 1907

THE PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN WORLD




ACT I


SCENE Country publichouse or shebeen very rough and untidy There
is a sort of counter on the right with shelves holding many bottles and
jugs just seen above it Empty barrels stand near the counter At back
a little to left of counter there is a door into the open air then
more to the left there is a settle with shelves above it with more
jugs and a table beneath a window At the left there is a large open
fireplace with turf fire and a small door into inner room Pegeen a
wild looking but fine girl of about twenty is writing at table She is
dressed in the usual peasant dress

PEGEEN  slowly as she writes  Six yards of stuff for to make a
yellow gown A pair of lace boots with lengthy heels on them and brassy
eyes A hat is suited for a weddingday A fine tooth comb To be
sent with three barrels of porter in Jimmy Farrells creel cart on the
evening of the coming Fair to Mister Michael James Flaherty With the
best compliments of this season Margaret Flaherty

SHAWN KEOGH  a fat and fair young man comes in as she signs looks
round awkwardly when he sees she is alone  Wheres himself

PEGEEN  without looking at him  Hes coming She directs the
letter To Mister Sheamus Mulroy Wine and Spirit Dealer Castlebar

SHAWN  uneasily  I didnt see him on the road

PEGEEN How would you see him licks stamp and puts it on letter and it
dark night this half hour gone by

SHAWN  turning towards the door again  I stood a while outside
wondering would I have a right to pass on or to walk in and see you
Pegeen Mike comes to fire and I could hear the cows breathing and
sighing in the stillness of the air and not a step moving any place
from this gate to the bridge

PEGEEN  putting letter in envelope  Its above at the crossroads
he is meeting Philly Cullen and a couple more are going along with him
to Kate Cassidys wake

SHAWN  looking at her blankly  And hes going that length in the
dark night

PEGEEN  impatiently He is surely and leaving me lonesome on the
scruff of the hill She gets up and puts envelope on dresser then
winds clock Isnt it long the nights are now Shawn Keogh to be
leaving a poor girl with her own self counting the hours to the dawn of
day

SHAWN  with awkward humour  If it is when were wedded in a
short while youll have no call to complain for Ive little will to be
walking off to wakes or weddings in the darkness of the night

PEGEEN  with rather scornful good humour  Youre making mighty
certain Shaneen that Ill wed you now

SHAWN Arent we after making a good bargain the way were only waiting
these days on Father Reillys dispensation from the bishops or the
Court of Rome

PEGEEN  looking at him teasingly washing up at dresser  Its a
wonder Shaneen the Holy Fatherd be taking notice of the likes of you
for if I was him I wouldnt bother with this place where youll meet
none but Red Linahan has a squint in his eye and Patcheen is lame in
his heel or the mad Mulrannies were driven from California and they
lost in their wits Were a queer lot these times to go troubling the
Holy Father on his sacred seat

SHAWN  scandalized If we are were as good this place as another
maybe and as good these times as we were for ever

PEGEEN  with scorn  As good is it Where now will you meet the
like of Daneen Sullivan knocked the eye from a peeler or Marcus Quin
God rest him got six months for maiming ewes and he a great warrant to
tell stories of holy Ireland till hed have the old women shedding
down tears about their feet Where will you find the like of them Im
saying

SHAWN  timidly If you dont its a good job maybe for with
peculiar emphasis on the words Father Reilly has small conceit to have
that kind walking around and talking to the girls

PEGEEN  impatiently throwing water from basin out of the door 
Stop tormenting me with Father Reilly imitating his voice when Im
asking only what way Ill pass these twelve hours of dark and not take
my death with the fear Looking out of door

SHAWN  timidly Would I fetch you the widow Quin maybe

PEGEEN Is it the like of that murderer Youll not surely

SHAWN  going to her soothingly  Then Im thinking himself will
stop along with you when he sees you taking on for itll be a long
nighttime with great darkness and Im after feeling a kind of fellow
above in the furzy ditch groaning wicked like a maddening dog the way
its good cause you have maybe to be fearing now

PEGEEN  turning on him sharply  Whats that Is it a man you
seen

SHAWN  retreating I couldnt see him at all but I heard him
groaning out and breaking his heart It should have been a young man
from his words speaking

PEGEEN  going after him  And you never went near to see was he
hurted or what ailed him at all

SHAWN I did not Pegeen Mike It was a dark lonesome place to be
hearing the like of him

PEGEEN Well youre a daring fellow and if they find his corpse
stretched above in the dews of dawn whatll you say then to the
peelers or the Justice of the Peace

SHAWN  thunderstruck I wasnt thinking of that For the love of
God Pegeen Mike dont let on I was speaking of him Dont tell your
father and the men is coming above for if they heard that story theyd
have great blabbing this night at the wake

PEGEEN Ill maybe tell them and Ill maybe not

SHAWN They are coming at the door Will you whisht Im saying

PEGEEN Whisht yourself

She goes behind counter Michael James fat jovial publican comes
in followed by Philly Cullen who is thin and mistrusting and Jimmy
Farrell who is fat and amorous about fortyfive

MEN  together  God bless you The blessing of God on this place

PEGEEN God bless you kindly

MICHAEL  to men who go to the counter  Sit down now and take
your rest Crosses to Shawn at the fire And how is it you are Shawn
Keogh Are you coming over the sands to Kate Cassidys wake

SHAWN I am not Michael James Im going home the short cut to my bed

PEGEEN  speaking across the counter  Hes right too and have
you no shame Michael James to be quitting off for the whole night and
leaving myself lonesome in the shop

MICHAEL  goodhumouredly Isnt it the same whether I go for the
whole night or a part only and Im thinking its a queer daughter you
are if youd have me crossing backward through the Stooks of the Dead
Women with a drop taken

PEGEEN If I am a queer daughter its a queer fatherd be leaving me
lonesome these twelve hours of dark and I piling the turf with the dogs
barking and the calves mooing and my own teeth rattling with the fear

JIMMY  flatteringly  What is there to hurt you and you a fine
hardy girl would knock the head of any two men in the place

PEGEEN  working herself up  Isnt there the harvest boys with
their tongues red for drink and the ten tinkers is camped in the east
glen and the thousand militia  bad cess to them  walking idle
through the land Theres lots surely to hurt me and I wont stop alone
in it let himself do what he will

MICHAEL If youre that afeard let Shawn Keogh stop along with you
Its the will of God Im thinking himself should be seeing to you now
They all turn on Shawn

SHAWN  in horrified confusion  I would and welcome Michael
James but Im afeard of Father Reilly and what at all would the Holy
Father and the Cardinals of Rome be saying if they heard I did the like
of that

MICHAEL  with contempt  God help you Cant you sit in by the
hearth with the light lit and herself beyond in the room Youll do that
surely for Ive heard tell theres a queer fellow above going mad or
getting his death maybe in the gripe of the ditch so shed be safer
this night with a person here

SHAWN  with plaintive despair  Im afeard of Father Reilly Im
saying Let you not be tempting me and we near married itself

PHILLY  with cold contempt  Lock him in the west room Hell stay
then and have no sin to be telling to the priest

MICHAEL  to Shawn getting between him and the door  Go up now

SHAWN  at the top of his voice  Dont stop me Michael James Let
me out of the door Im saying for the love of the Almighty God Let me
out trying to dodge past him Let me out of it and may God grant you
His indulgence in the hour of need

MICHAEL  loudly Stop your noising and sit down by the hearth
Gives him a push and goes to counter laughing

SHAWN  turning back wringing his hands  Oh Father Reilly and
the saints of God where will I hide myself today Oh St Joseph and
St Patrick and St Brigid and St James have mercy on me now Shawn
turns round sees door clear and makes a rush for it

MICHAEL  catching him by the coattail  Youd be going is it

SHAWN  screaming Leave me go Michael James leave me go you old
Pagan leave me go or Ill get the curse of the priests on you and
of the scarletcoated bishops of the courts of Rome With a sudden
movement he pulls himself out of his coat and disappears out of the
door leaving his coat in Michaels hands

MICHAEL  turning round and holding up coat  Well theres the
coat of a Christian man Oh theres sainted glory this day in the
lonesome west and by the will of God Ive got you a decent man Pegeen
youll have no call to be spying after if youve a score of young girls
maybe weeding in your fields

PEGEEN taking up the defence of her property  What right have you
to be making game of a poor fellow for minding the priest when its
your own the fault is not paying a penny potboy to stand along with
me and give me courage in the doing of my work She snaps the coat away
from him and goes behind counter with it

MICHAEL  taken aback  Where would I get a potboy Would you have
me send the bellman screaming in the streets of Castlebar

SHAWN  opening the door a chink and putting in his head in a small
voice  Michael James

MICHAEL  imitating him  What ails you

SHAWN The queer dying fellows beyond looking over the ditch Hes come
up Im thinking stealing your hens Looks over his shoulder God
help me hes following me now he runs into room and if hes heard
what I said hell be having my life and I going home lonesome in the
darkness of the night For a perceptible moment they watch the door
with curiosity Some one coughs outside Then Christy Mahon a slight
young man comes in very tired and frightened and dirty

CHRISTY  in a small voice  God save all here

MEN God save you kindly

CHRISTY  going to the counter  Id trouble you for a glass of
porter woman of the house He puts down coin

PEGEEN  serving him  Youre one of the tinkers young fellow is
beyond camped in the glen

CHRISTY I am not but Im destroyed walking

MICHAEL  patronizingly Let you come up then to the fire Youre
looking famished with the cold

CHRISTY God reward you He takes up his glass and goes a little way
across to the left then stops and looks about him Is it often the
police do be coming into this place master of the house

MICHAEL If youd come in better hours youd have seen Licensed for
the sale of Beer and Spirits to be consumed on the premises written
in white letters above the door and what would the polis want spying
on me and not a decent house within four miles the way every living
Christian is a bona fide saving one widow alone

CHRISTY  with relief  Its a safe house so He goes over to the
fire sighing and moaning Then he sits down putting his glass beside
him and begins gnawing a turnip too miserable to feel the others
staring at him with curiosity

MICHAEL  going after him  Is it yourself fearing the polis
Youre wanting maybe

CHRISTY Theres many wanting

MICHAEL Many surely with the broken harvest and the ended wars He
picks up some stockings etc that are near the fire and carries them
away furtively It should be larceny Im thinking

CHRISTY  dolefully I had it in my mind it was a different word and
a bigger

PEGEEN Theres a queer lad Were you never slapped in school young
fellow that you dont know the name of your deed

CHRISTY  bashfully Im slow at learning a middling scholar only

MICHAEL If youre a dunce itself youd have a right to know that
larcenys robbing and stealing Is it for the like of that youre
wanting

CHRISTY  with a flash of family pride  And I the son of a strong
farmer with a sudden qualm God rest his soul could have bought
up the whole of your old house a while since from the butt of his
tailpocket and not have missed the weight of it gone

MICHAEL  impressed If its not stealing its maybe something big

CHRISTY  flattered Aye its maybe something big

JIMMY Hes a wickedlooking young fellow Maybe he followed after a
young woman on a lonesome night

CHRISTY  shocked Oh the saints forbid mister I was all times a
decent lad

PHILLY  turning on Jimmy  Youre a silly man Jimmy Farrell He
said his father was a farmer a while since and theres himself now in
a poor state Maybe the land was grabbed from him and he did what any
decent man would do

MICHAEL  to Christy mysteriously  Was it bailiffs

CHRISTY The divil a one

MICHAEL Agents

CHRISTY The divil a one

MICHAEL Landlords

CHRISTY  peevishly Ah not at all Im saying Youd see the like
of them stories on any little paper of a Munster town But Im not
calling to mind any person gentle simple judge or jury did the like
of me They all draw nearer with delighted curiosity

PHILLY Well that lads a puzzlethe world

JIMMY Hed beat Dan Davies circus or the holy missioners making
sermons on the villainy of man Try him again Philly

PHILLY Did you strike golden guineas out of solder young fellow or
shilling coins itself

CHRISTY I did not mister not sixpence nor a farthing coin

JIMMY Did you marry three wives maybe Im told theres a sprinkling
have done that among the holy Luthers of the preaching north

CHRISTY  shyly  I never married with one let alone with a couple
or three

PHILLY Maybe he went fighting for the Boers the like of the man
beyond was judged to be hanged quartered and drawn Were you off east
young fellow fighting bloody wars for Kruger and the freedom of the
Boers

CHRISTY I never left my own parish till Tuesday was a week

PEGEEN  coming from counter  Hes done nothing so To Christy
If you didnt commit murder or a bad nasty thing or false coining
or robbery or butchery or the like of them there isnt anything that
would be worth your troubling for to run from now You did nothing at
all

CHRISTY  his feelings hurt  Thats an unkindly thing to be saying
to a poor orphaned traveller has a prison behind him and hanging
before and hells gap gaping below

PEGEEN with a sign to the men to be quiet  Youre only saying it
You did nothing at all A soft lad the like of you wouldnt slit the
windpipe of a screeching sow

CHRISTY  offended Youre not speaking the truth

PEGEEN  in mock rage  Not speaking the truth is it Would you
have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom

CHRISTY  twisting round on her with a sharp cry of horror  Dont
strike me I killed my poor father Tuesday was a week for doing the
like of that

PEGEEN with blank amazement  Is it killed your father

CHRISTY  subsiding With the help of God I did surely and that the
Holy Immaculate Mother may intercede for his soul

PHILLY  retreating with Jimmy  Theres a daring fellow

JIMMY Oh glory be to God

MICHAEL  with great respect  That was a hanging crime mister
honey You should have had good reason for doing the like of that

CHRISTY  in a very reasonable tone  He was a dirty man God
forgive him and he getting old and crusty the way I couldnt put up
with him at all

PEGEEN And you shot him dead

CHRISTY  shaking his head  I never used weapons Ive no license
and Im a lawfearing man

MICHAEL It was with a hilted knife maybe Im told in the big world
its bloody knives they use

CHRISTY  loudly scandalized  Do you take me for a slaughterboy

PEGEEN You never hanged him the way Jimmy Farrell hanged his dog from
the license and had it screeching and wriggling three hours at the butt
of a string and himself swearing it was a dead dog and the peelers
swearing it had life

CHRISTY I did not then I just riz the loy and let fall the edge of
it on the ridge of his skull and he went down at my feet like an empty
sack and never let a grunt or groan from him at all

MICHAEL  making a sign to Pegeen to fill Christys glass  And
what way werent you hanged mister Did you bury him then

CHRISTY  considering Aye I buried him then Wasnt I digging spuds
in the field

MICHAEL And the peelers never followed after you the eleven days that
youre out

CHRISTY  shaking his head  Never a one of them and I walking
forward facing hog dog or divil on the highway of the road

PHILLY  nodding wisely  Its only with a common weekday kind
of a murderer them lads would be trusting their carcase and that man
should be a great terror when his tempers roused

MICHAEL He should then To Christy And where was it mister honey
that you did the deed

CHRISTY  looking at him with suspicion  Oh a distant place
master of the house a windy corner of high distant hills

PHILLY  nodding with approval  Hes a close man and hes right
surely

PEGEEN Thatd be a lad with the sense of Solomon to have for a potboy
Michael James if its the truth youre seeking one at all

PHILLY The peelers is fearing him and if youd that lad in the house
there isnt one of them would come smelling around if the dogs itself
were lapping poteen from the dungpit of the yard

JIMMY Braverys a treasure in a lonesome place and a lad would kill
his father Im thinking would face a foxy divil with a pitchpike on
the flags of hell

PEGEEN Its the truth theyre saying and if Id that lad in the house
I wouldnt be fearing the loosed kharki cutthroats or the walking
dead

CHRISTY  swelling with surprise and triumph  Well glory be to
God

MICHAEL  with deference  Would you think well to stop here and be
potboy mister honey if we gave you good wages and didnt destroy you
with the weight of work

SHAWN  coming forward uneasily  Thatd be a queer kind to bring
into a decent quiet household with the like of Pegeen Mike

PEGEEN  very sharply  Will you whisht Whos speaking to you

SHAWN  retreating A bloodyhanded murderer the like of

PEGEEN  snapping at him  Whisht I am saying well take no
fooling from your like at all To Christy with a honeyed voice And
you young fellow youd have a right to stop Im thinking for wed do
our all and utmost to content your needs

CHRISTY  overcome with wonder  And Id be safe in this place from
the searching law

MICHAEL You would surely If theyre not fearing you itself the
peelers in this place is decent droughty poor fellows wouldnt touch a
cur dog and not give warning in the dead of night

PEGEEN  very kindly and persuasively  Let you stop a short
while anyhow Arent you destroyed walking with your feet in bleeding
blisters and your whole skin needing washing like a Wicklow sheep

CHRISTY  looking round with satisfaction Its a nice room and if
its not humbugging me you are Im thinking that Ill surely stay

JIMMY  jumps up  Now by the grace of God herself will be safe
this night with a man killed his father holding danger from the door
and let you come on Michael James or theyll have the best stuff drunk
at the wake

MICHAEL  going to the door with men And begging your pardon
mister what name will we call you for wed like to know

CHRISTY Christopher Mahon

MICHAEL Well God bless you Christy and a good rest till we meet
again when the sunll be rising to the noon of day

CHRISTY God bless you all

MEN God bless you They go out except Shawn who lingers at door

SHAWN  to Pegeen  Are you wanting me to stop along with you and
keep you from harm

PEGEEN  gruffly Didnt you say you were fearing Father Reilly

SHAWN Thered be no harm staying now Im thinking and himself in it
too

PEGEEN You wouldnt stay when there was need for you and let you step
off nimble this time when theres none

SHAWN Didnt I say it was Father Reilly

PEGEEN Go on then to Father Reilly in a jeering tone and let him
put you in the holy brotherhoods and leave that lad to me

SHAWN If I meet the Widow Quin

PEGEEN Go on Im saying and dont be waking this place with your
noise She hustles him out and bolts the door That lad would wear
the spirits from the saints of peace Bustles about then takes off
her apron and pins it up in the window as a blind Christy watching her
timidly Then she comes to him and speaks with bland goodhumour Let
you stretch out now by the fire young fellow You should be destroyed
travelling

CHRISTY  shyly again drawing off his boots Im tired surely
walking wild eleven days and waking fearful in the night He holds
up one of his feet feeling his blisters and looking at them with
compassion

PEGEEN  standing beside him watching him with delight  You
should have had great people in your family Im thinking with the
little small feet you have and you with a kind of a quality name the
like of what youd find on the great powers and potentates of France and
Spain

CHRISTY  with pride  We were great surely with wide and windy
acres of rich Munster land

PEGEEN Wasnt I telling you and you a fine handsome young fellow with
a noble brow

CHRISTY  with a flash of delighted surprise Is it me

PEGEEN Aye Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come
from in the west or south

CHRISTY  with venom  I did not then Oh theyre bloody liars in
the naked parish where I grew a man

PEGEEN If they are itself youve heard it these days Im thinking
and you walking the world telling out your story to young girls or old

CHRISTY Ive told my story no place till this night Pegeen Mike and
its foolish I was here maybe to be talking free but youre decent
people Im thinking and yourself a kindly woman the way I wasnt
fearing you at all

PEGEEN  filling a sack with straw  Youve said the like of that
maybe in every cot and cabin where youve met a young girl on your way

CHRISTY  going over to her gradually raising his voice  Ive
said it nowhere till this night Im telling you for Ive seen none the
like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world looking over a
low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south into stony scattered
fields or scribes of bog where youd see young limber girls and fine
prancing women making laughter with the men

PEGEEN If you werent destroyed travelling youd have as much talk
and streeleen Im thinking as Owen Roe OSullivan or the poets of the
Dingle Bay and Ive heard all times its the poets are your like fine
fiery fellows with great rages when their tempers roused

CHRISTY  drawing a little nearer to her  Youve a power of rings
God bless you and would there be any offence if I was asking are you
single now

PEGEEN What would I want wedding so young

CHRISTY  with relief  Were alike so

PEGEEN  she puts sack on settle and beats it up  I never killed
my father Id be afeard to do that except I was the like of yourself
with blind rages tearing me within for Im thinking you should have had
great tussling when the end was come

CHRISTY  expanding with delight at the first confidential talk he has
ever had with a woman  We had not then It was a hard woman was come
over the hill and if he was always a crusty kind when hed a hard woman
setting him on not the divil himself or his four fathers could put up
with him at all

PEGEEN  with curiosity  And isnt it a great wonder that one
wasnt fearing you

CHRISTY  very confidentially  Up to the day I killed my father
there wasnt a person in Ireland knew the kind I was and I there
drinking waking eating sleeping a quiet simple poor fellow with no
man giving me heed

PEGEEN  getting a quilt out of the cupboard and putting it on the
sack  It was the girls were giving you heed maybe and Im thinking
its most conceit youd have to be gaming with their like

CHRISTY  shaking his head with simplicity Not the girls itself
and I wont tell you a lie There wasnt anyone heeding me in that place
saving only the dumb beasts of the field He sits down at fire

PEGEEN  with disappointment  And I thinking you should have been
living the like of a king of Norway or the Eastern world She comes and
sits beside him after placing bread and mug of milk on the table

CHRISTY  laughing piteously  The like of a king is it And I
after toiling moiling digging dodging from the dawn till dusk with
never a sight of joy or sport saving only when Id be abroad in the dark
night poaching rabbits on hills for I was a devil to poach God forgive
me very naively and I near got six months for going with a dung fork
and stabbing a fish

PEGEEN And its that youd call sport is it to be abroad in the
darkness with yourself alone

CHRISTY I did God help me and there Id be as happy as the sunshine
of St Martins Day watching the light passing the north or the patches
of fog till Id hear a rabbit starting to screech and Id go running in
the furze Then when Id my full share Id come walking down where youd
see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road
and before Id pass the dunghill Id hear himself snoring out a loud
lonesome snore hed be making all times the while he was sleeping and
he a man d be raging all times the while he was waking like a gaudy
officer youd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths

PEGEEN Providence and Mercy spare us all

CHRISTY Its that youd say surely if you seen him and he after
drinking for weeks rising up in the red dawn or before it maybe and
going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of May and
shying clods against the visage of the stars till hed put the fear of
death into the banbhs and the screeching sows

PEGEEN Id be wellnight afeard of that lad myself Im thinking And
there was no one in it but the two of you alone

CHRISTY The divil a one though hed sons and daughters walking all
great states and territories of the world and not a one of them to
this day but would say their seven curses on him and they rousing up
to let a cough or sneeze maybe in the deadness of the night

PEGEEN nodding her head  Well you should have been a queer lot
I never cursed my father the like of that though Im twenty and more
years of age

CHRISTY Then youd have cursed mine Im telling you and he a man
never gave peace to any saving when hed get two months or three or
be locked in the asylums for battering peelers or assaulting men with
depression the way it was a bitter life he led me till I did up a
Tuesday and halve his skull

PEGEEN  putting her hand on his shoulder  Well youll have peace
in this place Christy Mahon and none to trouble you and its near
time a fine lad like you should have your good share of the earth

CHRISTY Its time surely and I a seemly fellow with great strength in
me and bravery of Someone knocks

CHRISTY  clinging to Pegeen  Oh glory its late for knocking
and this last while Im in terror of the peelers and the walking dead
Knocking again

PEGEEN Whos there

VOICE  outside Me

PEGEEN Whos me

VOICE The Widow Quin

PEGEEN jumping up and giving him the bread and milk  Go on now with
your supper and let on to be sleepy for if she found you were such
a warrant to talk shed be stringing gabble till the dawn of day He
takes bread and sits shyly with his back to the door

PEGEEN opening door with temper  What ails you or what is it
youre wanting at this hour of the night

WIDOW QUIN  coming in a step and peering at Christy  Im after
meeting Shawn Keogh and Father Reilly below who told me of your
curiosity man and they fearing by this time he was maybe roaring
romping on your hands with drink

PEGEEN pointing to Christy  Look now is he roaring and he
stretched away drowsy with his supper and his mug of milk Walk down and
tell that to Father Reilly and to Shaneen Keogh

WIDOW QUIN  coming forward  Ill not see them again for Ive
their word to lead that lad forward for to lodge with me

PEGEEN  in blank amazement  This night is it

WIDOW QUIN  going over  This night It isnt fitting says the
priesteen to have his likeness lodging with an orphaned girl To
Christy God save you mister

CHRISTY  shyly  God save you kindly

WIDOW QUIN  looking at him with halfamazed curiosity  Well
arent you a little smiling fellow It should have been great and bitter
torments did rouse your spirits to a deed of blood

CHRISTY  doubtfully It should maybe

WIDOW QUIN Its more than maybe Im saying and itd soften my heart
to see you sitting so simple with your cup and cake and you fitter to
be saying your catechism than slaying your da

PEGEEN  at counter washing glasses  Theres talking when anyd
see hes fit to be holding his head high with the wonders of the world
Walk on from this for Ill not have him tormented and he destroyed
travelling since Tuesday was a week

WIDOW QUIN  peaceably Well be walking surely when his suppers
done and youll find were great company young fellow when its of
the like of you and me youd hear the penny poets singing in an August
Fair

CHRISTY  innocently Did you kill your father

PEGEEN  contemptuously She did not She hit himself with a worn
pick and the rusted poison did corrode his blood the way he never
overed it and died after That was a sneaky kind of murder did win
small glory with the boys itself She crosses to Christys left

WIDOW QUIN  with goodhumour  If it didnt maybe all knows a
widow woman has buried her children and destroyed her man is a
wiser comrade for a young lad than a girl the like of you whod go
helterskeltering after any man would let you a wink upon the road

PEGEEN  breaking out into wild rage  And youll say that Widow
Quin and you gasping with the rage you had racing the hill beyond to
look on his face

WIDOW QUIN  laughing derisively  Me is it Well Father Reilly
has cuteness to divide you now She pulls Christy up Theres great
temptation in a man did slay his da and wed best be going young
fellow so rise up and come with me

PEGEEN  seizing his arm  Hell not stir Hes potboy in this
place and Ill not have him stolen off and kidnabbed while himselfs
abroad

WIDOW QUIN Itd be a crazy potboyd lodge him in the shebeen where he
works by day so youd have a right to come on young fellow till you
see my little houseen a perch off on the rising hill

PEGEEN Wait till morning Christy Mahon Wait till you lay eyes on her
leaky thatch is growing more pasture for her buck goat than her square
of fields and she without a tramp itself to keep in order her place at
all

WIDOW QUIN When you see me contriving in my little gardens Christy
Mahon youll swear the Lord God formed me to be living lone and that
there isnt my match in Mayo for thatching or mowing or shearing a
sheep

PEGEEN  with noisy scorn  Its true the Lord God formed you to
contrive indeed Doesnt the world know you reared a black lamb at your
own breast so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of
a Christian and he eating it after in a kidney stew Doesnt the
world know youve been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a
threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a
mountain goat youd meet leaping the hills

WIDOW QUIN  with amusement  Do you hear her now young fellow Do
you hear the way shell be rating at your own self when a week is by

PEGEEN  to Christy  Dont heed her Tell her to go into her
pigsty and not plague us here

WIDOW QUIN Im going but hell come with me

PEGEEN  shaking him  Are you dumb young fellow

CHRISTY  timidly to Widow Quin  God increase you but Im
potboy in this place and its here Id liefer stay

PEGEEN  triumphantly Now you have heard him and go on from this

WIDOW QUIN  looking round the room  Its lonesome this hour
crossing the hill and if he wont come along with me Id have a right
maybe to stop this night with yourselves Let me stretch out on the
settle Pegeen Mike and himself can lie by the hearth

PEGEEN  short and fiercely  Faith I wont Quit off or I will
send you now

WIDOW QUIN  gathering her shawl up  Well its a terror to be
aged a score To Christy God bless you now young fellow and let
you be wary or theres right torment will await you here if you go
romancing with her like and she waiting only as they bade me say on a
sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen

CHRISTY  going to Pegeen as she bolts the door  Whats that shes
after saying

PEGEEN Lies and blather youve no call to mind Well isnt Shawn
Keogh an impudent fellow to send up spying on me Wait till I lay hands
on him Let him wait Im saying

CHRISTY And youre not wedding him at all

PEGEEN I wouldnt wed him if a bishop came walking for to join us here

CHRISTY That God in glory may be thanked for that

PEGEEN Theres your bed now Ive put a quilt upon you Im after
quilting a while since with my own two hands and youd best stretch out
now for your sleep and may God give you a good rest till I call you in
the morning when the cocks will crow

CHRISTY  as she goes to inner room  May God and Mary and St
Patrick bless you and reward you for your kindly talk She shuts
the door behind her He settles his bed slowly feeling the quilt with
immense satisfaction  Well its a clean bed and soft with it and
its great luck and company Ive won me in the end of time  two fine
women fighting for the likes of me  till Im thinking this night
wasnt I a foolish fellow not to kill my father in the years gone by

CURTAIN

cheerful is cleaning a girls boots

CHRISTY  to himself counting jugs on dresser  Half a hundred

be hard set to count and enough in them Im thinking to drunken
all the wealth and wisdom of the County Clare He puts down the boot
carefully Theres her boots now nice and decent for her evening
use and isnt it grand brushes she has He puts them down and goes
by degrees to the lookingglass Well thisd be a fine place to be my
whole life talking out with swearing Christians in place of my old dogs
and cat and I stalking around smoking my pipe and drinking my fill
and never a days work but drawing a cork an odd time or wiping a
glass or rinsing out a shiny tumbler for a decent man He takes the
lookingglass from the wall and puts it on the back of a chair then
sits down in front of it and begins washing his face Didnt I know
rightly I was handsome though it was the divils own mirror we had
beyond would twist a squint across an angels brow and Ill be growing
fine from this day the way Ill have a soft lovely skin on me and wont
be the like of the clumsy young fellows do be ploughing all times in
the earth and dung He starts Is she coming again He looks out
Stranger girls God help me wherell I hide myself away and my long
neck nacked to the world He looks out Id best go to the room maybe

and runs into the inner room The door is pushed open and Susan Brady
looks in and knocks on door

SUSAN Theres nobody in it Knocks again

NELLY  pushing her in and following her with Honor Blake and Sara
Tansey Itd be early for them both to be out walking the hill

such man in it at all

HONOR  pointing to straw and quilt  Look at that Hes been
sleeping there in the night Well itll be a hard case if hes gone off
now the way well never set our eyes on a man killed his father and we
after rising early and destroying ourselves running fast on the hill

NELLY Are you thinking thems his boots

track on them Did you never read in the papers the way murdered men do
bleed and drip

SUSAN Is that blood there Sara Tansey

own they are surely for I never seen the like of them for whity mud
and red mud and turf on them and the fine sands of the sea That mans

his boots

SUSAN  going to window  Maybe hes stolen off to Belmullet with
the boots of Michael James and youd have a right so to follow after

miles to set your eyes on the man bit the yellow ladys nostril on the
northern shore She looks out

SARA  running to window with one boot on  Dont be talking and
we fooled today Putting on other boot Theres a pair do fit me
well and Ill be keeping them for walking to the priest when youd be
ashamed this place going up winter and summer with nothing worth while
to confess at all

HONOR  who has been listening at the door  Whisht theres
someone inside the room She pushes door a chink open Its a man
Sara kicks off boots and puts them where they were They all stand in a
line looking through chink

SARA Ill call him Mister Mister He puts in his head Is Pegeen

CHRISTY  coming in as meek as a mouse with the lookingglass held
behind his back  Shes above on the cnuceen seeking the nanny
goats the way shed have a sup of goats milk for to colour my tea

SARA And asking your pardon is it yous the man killed his father

CHRISTY  sidling toward the nail where the glass was hanging  I

SARA  taking eggs she has brought  Then my thousand welcomes to
you and Ive run up with a brace of ducks eggs for your food today
Pegeens ducks is no use but these are the real rich sort Hold out
your hand and youll see its no lie Im telling you

CHRISTY  coming forward shyly and holding out his left hand 
Theyre a great and weighty size

SUSAN And I run up with a pat of butter for itd be a poor thing to
have you eating your spuds dry and you after running a great way since
you did destroy your da

CHRISTY Thank you kindly

HONOR And I brought you a little cut of cake for you should have a
thin stomach on you and you that length walking the world

NELLY And I brought you a little laying pullet  boiled and all she is
 was crushed at the fall of night by the curates car Feel the fat of
that breast Mister

CHRISTY Its bursting surely He feels it with the back of his
hand in which he holds the presents

SARA Will you pinch it Is your right hand too sacred for to use at
all She slips round behind him Its a glass he has Well I never
seen to this day a man with a lookingglass held to his back Them that
kills their fathers is a vain lot surely Girls giggle

CHRISTY  smiling innocently and piling presents on glass  Im
very thankful to you all today

WIDOW QUIN  coming in quickly at door  Sara Tansey Susan Brady
Honor Blake What in glory has you here at this hour of day

GIRLS  giggling Thats the man killed his father

WIDOW QUIN  coming to them  I know well its the man and
Im after putting him down in the sports below for racing leaping
pitching and the Lord knows what

SARA  exuberantly Thats right Widow Quin Ill bet my dowry that
hell lick the world

WIDOW QUIN If you will youd have a right to have him fresh and
nourished in place of nursing a feast Taking presents Are you
fasting or fed young fellow

CHRISTY Fasting if you please

WIDOW QUIN  loudly Well youre the lot Stir up now and give him
his breakfast To Christy Come here to me she puts him on bench
beside her while the girls make tea and get his breakfast and let you
tell us your story before Pegeen will come in place of grinning your
ears off like the moon of May

CHRISTY  beginning to be pleased  Its a long story youd be
destroyed listening

WIDOW QUIN Dont be letting on to be shy a fine gamey treacherous
lad the like of you Was it in your house beyond you cracked his skull

CHRISTY  shy but flattered  It was not We were digging spuds in
his cold sloping stony divils patch of a field

WIDOW QUIN And you went asking money of him or making talk of getting
a wife would drive him from his farm

CHRISTY I did not then but there I was digging and digging and You
squinting idiot says he let you walk down now and tell the priest
youll wed the Widow Casey in a score of days

WIDOW QUIN And what kind was she

CHRISTY  with horror  A walking terror from beyond the hills and
she two score and five years and two hundredweights and five pounds in
the weighing scales with a limping leg on her and a blinded eye and
she a woman of noted misbehaviour with the old and young

GIRLS  clustering round him serving him  Glory be

WIDOW QUIN And what did he want driving you to wed with her She takes
a bit of the chicken

CHRISTY  eating with growing satisfaction He was letting on I was
wanting a protector from the harshness of the world and he without a
thought the whole while but how hed have her hut to live in and her
gold to drink

WIDOW QUIN Theres maybe worse than a dry hearth and a widow woman and
your glass at night So you hit him then

CHRISTY  getting almost excited  I did not I wont wed her
says I when all know she did suckle me for six weeks when I came into
the world and she a hag this day with a tongue on her has the crows and
seabirds scattered the way they wouldnt cast a shadow on her garden
with the dread of her curse

WIDOW QUIN  teasingly That one should be right company

SARA  eagerly Dont mind her Did you kill him then

CHRISTY Shes too good for the like of you says he and go on now
or Ill flatten you out like a crawling beast has passed under a dray
You will not if I can help it says I Go on says he or Ill have
the divil making garters of your limbs tonight You will not if I can
help it says I He sits up brandishing his mug

SARA You were right surely

CHRISTY  impressively With that the sun came out between the cloud
and the hill and it shining green in my face God have mercy on your
soul says he lifting a scythe or on your own says I raising the
loy SUSAN Thats a grand story

HONOR He tells it lovely

CHRISTY  flattered and confident waving bone  He gave a drive
with the scythe and I gave a lep to the east Then I turned around with
my back to the north and I hit a blow on the ridge of his skull laid
him stretched out and he split to the knob of his gullet He raises
the chicken bone to his Adams apple

GIRLS  together Well youre a marvel Oh God bless you Youre
the lad surely

SUSAN Im thinking the Lord God sent him this road to make a second
husband to the Widow Quin and she with a great yearning to be wedded
though all dread her here Lift him on her knee Sara Tansey

WIDOW QUIN Dont tease him

SARA  going over to dresser and counter very quickly and getting two
glasses and porter  Youre heroes surely and let you drink a supeen
with your arms linked like the outlandish lovers in the sailors song
She links their arms and gives them the glasses There now Drink
a health to the wonders of the western world the pirates preachers
poteenmakers with the jobbing jockies parching peelers and the
juries fill their stomachs selling judgments of the English law
Brandishing the bottle

WIDOW QUIN Thats a right toast Sara Tansey Now Christy They drink
with their arms linked he drinking with his left hand she with her
right As they are drinking Pegeen Mike comes in with a milk can and
stands aghast They all spring away from Christy He goes down left
Widow Quin remains seated

PEGEEN  angrily to Sara  What is it youre wanting

SARA  twisting her apron  An ounce of tobacco

PEGEEN Have you tuppence

SARA Ive forgotten my purse

PEGEEN Then youd best be getting it and not fooling us here To the
Widow Quin with more elaborate scorn And what is it youre wanting
Widow Quin

WIDOW QUIN  insolently A pennorth of starch

PEGEEN  breaking out  And you without a white shift or a shirt in
your whole family since the drying of the flood Ive no starch for the
like of you and let you walk on now to Killamuck

WIDOW QUIN  turning to Christy as she goes out with the girls 
Well youre mighty huffy this day Pegeen Mike and you young fellow
let you not forget the sports and racing when the noon is by They go
out

PEGEEN  imperiously Fling out that rubbish and put them cups away
Christy tidies away in great haste Shove in the bench by the wall
He does so And hang that glass on the nail What disturbed it at all

CHRISTY  very meekly  I was making myself decent only and this a
fine country for young lovely girls

PEGEEN  sharply Whisht your talking of girls Goes to counter
right

CHRISTY Wouldnt any wish to be decent in a place

PEGEEN Whisht Im saying

CHRISTY  looks at her face for a moment with great misgivings then
as a last effort takes up a loy and goes towards her with feigned
assurance  It was with a loy the like of that I killed my father

PEGEEN  still sharply  Youve told me that story six times since
the dawn of day

CHRISTY  reproachfully Its a queer thing you wouldnt care to be
hearing it and them girls after walking four miles to be listening to me
now

PEGEEN  turning round astonished  Four miles

CHRISTY  apologetically Didnt himself say there were only four
bona fides living in the place

PEGEEN Its bona fides by the road they are but that lot came over the
river lepping the stones Its not three perches when you go like that
and I was down this morning looking on the papers the postboy does have
in his bag With meaning and emphasis For there was great news this
day Christopher Mahon She goes into room left

CHRISTY  suspiciously Is it news of my murder

PEGEEN  inside Murder indeed

CHRISTY  loudly A murdered da

PEGEEN coming in again and crossing right  There was not but a
story filled half a page of the hanging of a man Ah that should be a
fearful end young fellow and it worst of all for a man who destroyed
his da for the like of him would get small mercies and when its dead
he is theyd put him in a narrow grave with cheap sacking wrapping him
round and pour down quicklime on his head the way youd see a woman
pouring any frishfrash from a cup

CHRISTY  very miserably  Oh God help me Are you thinking Im
safe You were saying at the fall of night I was shut of jeopardy and I
here with yourselves

PEGEEN  severely Youll be shut of jeopardy no place if you go
talking with a pack of wild girls the like of them do be walking abroad
with the peelers talking whispers at the fall of night

CHRISTY  with terror  And youre thinking theyd tell

PEGEEN  with mock sympathy  Who knows God help you

CHRISTY  loudly What joy would they have to bring hanging to the
likes of me

PEGEEN Its queer joys they have and who knows the thing theyd do
if itd make the green stones cry itself to think of you swaying and
swiggling at the butt of a rope and you with a fine stout neck God
bless you the way youd be a half an hour in great anguish getting
your death

CHRISTY  getting his boots and putting them on  If theres that
terror of them itd be best maybe I went on wandering like Esau or
Cain and Abel on the sides of Neifin or the Erris plain

PEGEEN beginning to play with him  It would maybe for Ive heard
the Circuit Judges this place is a heartless crew

CHRISTY  bitterly Its more than Judges this place is a heartless
crew Looking up at her And isnt it a poor thing to be starting
again and I a lonesome fellow will be looking out on women and girls the
way the needy fallen spirits do be looking on the Lord

PEGEEN What call have you to be that lonesome when theres poor girls
walking Mayo in their thousands now

CHRISTY  grimly Its well you know what call I have Its well you
know its a lonesome thing to be passing small towns with the lights
shining sideways when the night is down or going in strange places with
a dog nosing before you and a dog nosing behind or drawn to the cities
where youd hear a voice kissing and talking deep love in every shadow
of the ditch and you passing on with an empty hungry stomach failing
from your heart

PEGEEN Im thinking youre an odd man Christy Mahon The oddest
walking fellow I ever set my eyes on to this hour today

CHRISTY What would any be but odd men and they living lonesome in the
world

PEGEEN Im not odd and Im my whole life with my father only

CHRISTY  with infinite admiration  How would a lovely handsome
woman the like of you be lonesome when all men should be thronging
around to hear the sweetness of your voice and the little infant
children should be pestering your steps Im thinking and you walking
the roads

PEGEEN Im hard set to know what way a coaxing fellow the like of
yourself should be lonesome either

CHRISTY Coaxing

PEGEEN Would you have me think a man never talked with the girls would
have the words youve spoken today Its only letting on you are to be
lonesome the way youd get around me now

CHRISTY I wish to God I was letting on but I was lonesome all times
and born lonesome Im thinking as the moon of dawn Going to door

PEGEEN  puzzled by his talk  Well its a story Im not
understanding at all why youd be worse than another Christy Mahon and
you a fine lad with the great savagery to destroy your da

CHRISTY Its little Im understanding myself saving only that my
hearts scalded this day and I going off stretching out the earth
between us the way Ill not be waking near you another dawn of the year
till the two of us do arise to hope or judgment with the saints of God
and now Id best be going with my wattle in my hand for hanging is a
poor thing turning to go and its little welcome only is left me in
this house today

PEGEEN  sharply Christy He turns round Come here to me He
goes towards her Lay down that switch and throw some sods on the fire
Youre potboy in this place and Ill not have you mitch off from us
now

CHRISTY You were saying Id be hanged if I stay

PEGEEN  quite kindly at last  Im after going down and reading
the fearful crimes of Ireland for two weeks or three and there wasnt a
word of your murder Getting up and going over to the counter Theyve
likely not found the body Youre safe so with ourselves

CHRISTY  astonished slowly  Its making game of me you were
following her with fearful joy and I can stay so working at your
side and I not lonesome from this mortal day

PEGEEN Whats to hinder you from staying except the widow woman or the
young girls would inveigle you off

CHRISTY  with rapture  And Ill have your words from this day
filling my ears and that look is come upon you meeting my two eyes and
I watching you loafing around in the warm sun or rinsing your ankles
when the night is come

PEGEEN  kindly but a little embarrassed Im thinking youll be
a loyal young lad to have working around and if you vexed me a while
since with your leaguing with the girls I wouldnt give a thraneen for
a lad hadnt a mighty spirit in him and a gamey heart Shawn Keogh runs
in carrying a cleeve on his back followed by the Widow Quin

SHAWN  to Pegeen  I was passing below and I seen your mountainy
sheep eating cabbages in Jimmys field Run up or theyll be bursting
surely

PEGEEN Oh God mend them She puts a shawl over her head and runs
out

CHRISTY  looking from one to the other Still in high spirits 
Id best go to her aid maybe Im handy with ewes

WIDOW QUIN  closing the door  She can do that much and there is
Shaneen has long speeches for to tell you now She sits down with an
amused smile

SHAWN  taking something from his pocket and offering it to Christy
 Do you see that mister

CHRISTY  looking at it  The half of a ticket to the Western
States

SHAWN  trembling with anxiety  Ill give it to you and my new
hat pulling it out of hamper and my breeches with the double seat
pulling it off and my new coat is woven from the blackest shearings
for three miles around giving him the coat Ill give you the whole of
them and my blessing and the blessing of Father Reilly itself maybe
if youll quit from this and leave us in the peace we had till last
night at the fall of dark

CHRISTY  with a new arrogance  And for what is it youre wanting
to get shut of me

SHAWN  looking to the Widow for help  Im a poor scholar with
middling faculties to coin a lie so Ill tell you the truth Christy
Mahon Im wedding with Pegeen beyond and I dont think well of having
a clever fearless man the like of you dwelling in her house

CHRISTY  almost pugnaciously  And youd be using bribery for to
banish me

SHAWN  in an imploring voice  Let you not take it badly mister
honey isnt beyond the best place for you where youll have golden
chains and shiny coats and you riding upon hunters with the ladies of
the land He makes an eager sign to the Widow Quin to come to help
him

WIDOW QUIN  coming over  Its true for him and youd best quit
off and not have that poor girl setting her mind on you for theres
Shaneen thinks she wouldnt suit you though all is saying that shell
wed you now Christy beams with delight

SHAWN  in terrified earnest  She wouldnt suit you and she with
the divils own temper the way youd be strangling one another in a
score of days He makes the movement of strangling with his hands
Its the like of me only that shes fit for a quiet simple fellow
wouldnt raise a hand upon her if she scratched itself

WIDOW QUIN  putting Shawns hat on Christy  Fit them clothes
on you anyhow young fellow and hed maybe loan them to you for the
sports Pushing him towards inner door Fit them on and you can give
your answer when you have them tried

CHRISTY  beaming delighted with the clothes  I will then Id
like herself to see me in them tweeds and hat He goes into room and
shuts the door

SHAWN  in great anxiety  Hed like herself to see them Hell not
leave us Widow Quin Hes a score of divils in him the way its well
nigh certain he will wed Pegeen

WIDOW QUIN  jeeringly Its true all girls are fond of courage and
do hate the like of you

SHAWN  walking about in desperation  Oh Widow Quin whatll I be
doing now Id inform again him but hed burst from Kilmainham and hed
be sure and certain to destroy me If I wasnt so Godfearing Id near
have courage to come behind him and run a pike into his side Oh its
a hard case to be an orphan and not to have your father that youre used
to and youd easy kill and make yourself a hero in the sight of all
Coming up to her Oh Widow Quin will you find me some contrivance
when Ive promised you a ewe

WIDOW QUIN A ewes a small thing but what would you give me if I did
wed him and did save you so

SHAWN  with astonishment You

WIDOW QUIN Aye Would you give me the red cow you have and the
mountainy ram and the right of way across your rye path and a load of
dung at Michaelmas and turbary upon the western hill

SHAWN  radiant with hope  I would surely and Id give you the
weddingring I have and the loan of a new suit the way youd have him
decent on the weddingday Id give you two kids for your dinner and a
gallon of poteen and Id call the piper on the long car to your wedding
from Crossmolina or from Ballina Id give you

WIDOW QUIN Thatll do so and let you whisht for hes coming now
again Christy comes in very natty in the new clothes Widow Quin goes
to him admiringly

WIDOW QUIN If you seen yourself now Im thinking youd be too proud to
speak to us at all and itd be a pity surely to have your like sailing
from Mayo to the Western World

CHRISTY  as proud as a peacock  Im not going If this is a poor
place itself Ill make myself contented to be lodging here Widow Quin
makes a sign to Shawn to leave them

SHAWN Well Im going measuring the racecourse while the tide is low
so Ill leave you the garments and my blessing for the sports today
God bless you He wriggles out

WIDOW QUIN  admiring Christy  Well youre mighty spruce young
fellow Sit down now while youre quiet till you talk with me

CHRISTY  swaggering Im going abroad on the hillside for to seek
Pegeen

WIDOW QUIN Youll have time and plenty for to seek Pegeen and you
heard me saying at the fall of night the two of us should be great
company

CHRISTY From this out Ill have no want of company when all sorts is
bringing me their food and clothing he swaggers to the door tightening
his belt the way theyd set their eyes upon a gallant orphan cleft his
father with one blow to the breeches belt He opens door then staggers
back Saints of glory Holy angels from the throne of light

WIDOW QUIN  going over  What ails you

CHRISTY Its the walking spirit of my murdered da

WIDOW QUIN  looking out  Is it that tramper

CHRISTY  wildly Wherell I hide my poor body from that ghost of
hell The door is pushed open and old Mahon appears on threshold
Christy darts in behind door

WIDOW QUIN  in great amusement  Cod save you my poor man

MAHON  gruffly Did you see a young lad passing this way in the
early morning or the fall of night

WIDOW QUIN Youre a queer kind to walk in not saluting at all

MAHON Did you see the young lad

WIDOW QUIN  stiffly What kind was he

MAHON An ugly young streeler with a murderous gob on him and a little
switch in his hand I met a tramper seen him coming this way at the fall
of night

WIDOW QUIN Theres harvest hundreds do be passing these days for the
Sligo boat For what is it youre wanting him my poor man

MAHON I want to destroy him for breaking the head on me with the clout
of a loy He takes off a big hat and shows his head in a mass of
bandages and plaster with some pride It was he did that and amnt
I a great wonder to think Ive traced him ten days with that rent in my
crown

WIDOW QUIN  taking his head in both hands and examining it with
extreme delight  That was a great blow And who hit you A robber
maybe

MAHON It was my own son hit me and he the divil a robber or anything
else but a dirty stuttering lout

WIDOW  letting go his skull and wiping her hands in her apron 
Youd best be wary of a mortified scalp I think they call it lepping
around with that wound in the splendour of the sun It was a bad blow
surely and you should have vexed him fearful to make him strike that
gash in his da

MAHON Is it me

WIDOW QUIN  amusing herself  Aye And isnt it a great shame when
the old and hardened do torment the young

MAHON  raging Torment him is it And I after holding out with the
patience of a martyred saint till theres nothing but destruction on
and Im driven out in my old age with none to aid me

WIDOW QUIN  greatly amused  Its a sacred wonder the way that
wickedness will spoil a man

MAHON My wickedness is it Amnt I after saying it is himself has me
destroyed and he a liar on walls a talker of folly a man youd see
stretched the half of the day in the brown ferns with his belly to the
sun

WIDOW QUIN Not working at all

MAHON The divil a work or if he did itself youd see him raising up a
haystack like the stalk of a rush or driving our last cow till he broke
her leg at the hip and when he wasnt at that hed be fooling over
little birds he had  finches and felts  or making mugs at his own
self in the bit of glass we had hung on the wall

WIDOW QUIN  looking at Christy  What way was he so foolish It
was running wild after the girls may be

MAHON  with a shout of derision  Running wild is it If he seen
a red petticoat coming swinging over the hill hed be off to hide in
the sticks and youd see him shooting out his sheeps eyes between the
little twigs and the leaves and his two ears rising like a hare looking
out through a gap Girls indeed

WIDOW QUIN It was drink maybe

MAHON And he a poor fellow would get drunk on the smell of a pint Hed
a queer rotten stomach Im telling you and when I gave him three pulls
from my pipe a while since he was taken with contortions till I had to
send him in the ass cart to the females nurse

WIDOW QUIN  clasping her hands  Well I never till this day heard
tell of a man the like of that

MAHON Id take a mighty oath you didnt surely and wasnt he the
laughing joke of every female woman where four baronies meet the way
the girls would stop their weeding if they seen him coming the road to
let a roar at him and call him the looney of Mahons

WIDOW QUIN Id give the world and all to see the like of him What kind
was he

MAHON A small low fellow

WIDOW QUIN And dark

MAHON Dark and dirty

WIDOW QUIN  considering Im thinking I seen him

MAHON  eagerly An ugly young blackguard

WIDOW QUIN A hideous fearful villain and the spit of you

MAHON What way is he fled

WIDOW QUIN Gone over the hills to catch a coasting steamer to the north
or south

MAHON Could I pull up on him now

WIDOW QUIN If youll cross the sands below where the tide is out
youll be in it as soon as himself for he had to go round ten miles by
the top of the bay She points to the door Strike down by the head
beyond and then follow on the roadway to the north and east Mahon goes
abruptly

WIDOW QUIN  shouting after him  Let you give him a good vengeance
when you come up with him but dont put yourself in the power of the
law for itd be a poor thing to see a judge in his black cap reading
out his sentence on a civil warrior the like of you She swings the
door to and looks at Christy who is cowering in terror for a moment
then she bursts into a laugh

WIDOW QUIN Well youre the walking Playboy of the Western World and

Ireland and he a kind of carcase that youd fling upon the sea

WIDOW QUIN  more soberly  Theres talking for a mans one only
son

CHRISTY  breaking out  His one son is it May I meet him with
one tooth and it aching and one eye to be seeing seven and seventy
divils in the twists of the road and one old timber leg on him to limp
into the scalding grave Looking out There he is now crossing the
strands and that the Lord God would send a high wave to wash him from
the world

WIDOW QUIN  scandalised Have you no shame putting her hand on his
shoulder and turning him round What ails you Near crying is it

CHRISTY  in despair and grief  Amnt I after seeing the
lovelight of the star of knowledge shining from her brow and hearing
words would put you thinking on the holy Brigid speaking to the infant
saints and now shell be turning again and speaking hard words to me
like an old woman with a spavindy ass shed have urging on a hill

WIDOW QUIN Theres poetry talk for a girl youd see itching and
scratching and she with a stale stink of poteen on her from selling in
the shop

ACT III

SCENE as before Later in the day Jimmy comes in slightly drunk

JIMMY  calls Pegeen Crosses to inner door Pegeen Mike Comes
back again into the room Pegeen Philly comes in in the same state
To Philly Did you see herself

PHILLY I did not but I sent Shawn Keogh with the ass cart for to bear
him home Trying cupboards which are locked Well isnt he a nasty
man to get into such staggers at a morning wake and isnt herself the
divils daughter for locking and she so fussy after that young gaffer

the nose of the cockshotman and winning all in the sports below
racing lepping dancing and the Lord knows what Hes right luck Im
telling you

PHILLY If he has hell be rightly hobbled yet and he not able to say
ten words without making a brag of the way he killed his father and the
great blow he hit with the loy

JIMMY A man cant hang by his own informing and his father should be
rotten by now Old Mahon passes window slowly

PHILLY Supposing a mans digging spuds in that field with a long spade
and supposing he flings up the two halves of that skull whatll be said
then in the papers and the courts of law

JIMMY Theyd say it was an old Dane maybe was drowned in the flood
Old Mahon comes in and sits down near door listening Did you never
hear tell of the skulls they have in the city of Dublin ranged out like
blue jugs in a cabin of Connaught

PHILLY And you believe that

JIMMY  pugnaciously Didnt a lad see them and he after coming
from harvesting in the Liverpool boat They have them there says he
making a show of the great people there was one time walking the world
White skulls and black skulls and yellow skulls and some with full
teeth and some havent only but one

PHILLY It was no lie maybe for when I was a young lad there was a
graveyard beyond the house with the remnants of a man who had thighs as
long as your arm He was a horrid man Im telling you and there was
many a fine Sunday Id put him together for fun and he with shiny
bones you wouldnt meet the like of these days in the cities of the
world

MAHON  getting up  You wouldnt is it Lay your eyes on that
skull and tell me where and when there was another the like of it is
splintered only from the blow of a loy

PHILLY Glory be to God And who hit you at all

MAHON  triumphantly It was my own son hit me Would you believe
that

JIMMY Well theres wonders hidden in the heart of man

PHILLY  suspiciously And what way was it done

MAHON  wandering about the room  Im after walking hundreds and
long scores of miles winning clean beds and the fill of my belly four
times in the day and I doing nothing but telling stories of that naked
truth He comes to them a little aggressively Give me a supeen and
Ill tell you now Widow Quin comes in and stands aghast behind him He
is facing Jimmy and Philly who are on the left

JIMMY Ask herself beyond Shes the stuff hidden in her shawl

WIDOW QUIN  coming to Mahon quickly  you here is it You didnt
go far at all

MAHON I seen the coasting steamer passing and I got a drought upon me
and a cramping leg so I said The divil go along with him and turned
again Looking under her shawl And let you give me a supeen for Im
destroyed travelling since Tuesday was a week

WIDOW QUIN  getting a glass in a cajoling tone  Sit down then by
the fire and take your ease for a space Youve a right to be destroyed
indeed with your walking and fighting and facing the sun giving him
poteen from a stone jar she has brought in There now is a drink for
you and may it be to your happiness and length of life

MAHON  taking glass greedily and sitting down by fire  God
increase you

WIDOW QUIN  taking men to the right stealthily  Do you know what
That mans raving from his wound today for I met him a while since
telling a rambling tale of a tinker had him destroyed Then he heard of
Christys deed and he up and says it was his son had cracked his skull
O isnt madness a fright for hell go killing someone yet and he
thinking its the man has struck him so

JIMMY  entirely convinced Its a fright surely I knew a party
was kicked in the head by a red mare and he went killing horses a great
while till he eat the insides of a clock and died after

PHILLY  with suspicion  Did he see Christy

WIDOW QUIN He didnt With a warning gesture Let you not be putting
him in mind of him or youll be likely summoned if theres murder done
Looking round at Mahon Whisht Hes listening Wait now till you hear
me taking him easy and unravelling all She goes to Mahon And what
way are you feeling mister Are you in contentment now

MAHON  slightly emotional from his drink  Im poorly only for
its a hard story the way Im left today when it was I did tend him
from his hour of birth and he a dunce never reached his second book
the way hed come from school manys the day with his legs lamed under
him and he blackened with his beatings like a tinkers ass Its a hard
story Im saying the way some do have their next and nighest raising
up a hand of murder on them and some is lonesome getting their death
with lamentation in the dead of night

WIDOW QUIN  not knowing what to say  To hear you talking so
quiet whod know you were the same fellow we seen pass today

MAHON Im the same surely The wrack and ruin of three score years
and its a terror to live that length I tell you and to have your
sons going to the dogs against you and you wore out scolding them and
skelping them and God knows what

PHILLY  to Jimmy  Hes not raving To Widow Quin Will you ask
him what kind was his son

WIDOW QUIN  to Mahon with a peculiar look  Was your son that
hit you a lad of one year and a score maybe a great hand at racing and
lepping and licking the world

MAHON  turning on her with a roar of rage  Didnt you hear me say
he was the fool of men the way from this out hell know the orphans
lot with old and young making game of him and they swearing raging
kicking at him like a mangy cur A great burst of cheering outside
someway off

MAHON  putting his hands to his ears  What in the name of God do
they want roaring below

WIDOW QUIN  with the shade of a smile  Theyre cheering a young
lad the champion Playboy of the Western World More cheering

MAHON  going to window Itd split my heart to hear them and I with
pulses in my brainpan for a week gone by Is it racing they are

JIMMY  looking from door  It is then They are mounting him for
the mule race will be run upon the sands Thats the playboy on the
winkered mule

MAHON puzzled That lad is it If you said it was a fool he was
Id have laid a mighty oath he was the likeness of my wandering son
uneasily putting his hand to his head Faith Im thinking Ill go
walking for to view the race

WIDOW QUIN  stopping him sharply  You will not Youd best take
the road to Belmullet and not be dillydallying in this place where
there isnt a spot you could sleep

PHILLY  coming forward  Dont mind her Mount there on the bench
and youll have a view of the whole Theyre hurrying before the tide
will rise and itd be near over if you went down the pathway through
the crags below

MAHON mounts on bench Widow Quin beside him  Thats a right view

leading Who is he at all

WIDOW QUIN Hes the champion of the world I tell you and there isnt
a hoporth isnt falling lucky to his hands today

PHILLY  looking out interested in the race  Look at that

WIDOW QUIN  shouting Watch him taking the gate Theres riding

JIMMY  cheering More power to the young lad

MAHON Hes passing the third

MAHON Look at the mule he has kicking the stars

WIDOW QUIN There was a lep catching hold of Mahon in her excitement

JIMMY Look at him skelping her

PHILLY And the mountain girls hooshing him on

JIMMY Its the last turn The posts cleared for them now

MAHON Look at the narrow place Hell be into the bogs With a yell
Good rider Hes through it again

JIMMY He neck and neck

MAHON Good boy to him Flames but hes in Great cheering in which

MAHON with hesitation Whats that Theyre raising him up Theyre
coming this way With a roar of rage and astonishment Its Christy
by the stars of God Id know his way of spitting and he astride the
moon He jumps down and makes for the door but Widow Quin catches him
and pulls him back

WIDOW QUIN Stay quiet will you Thats not your son To Jimmy Stop
him or youll get a month for the abetting of manslaughter and be fined
as well

JIMMY Ill hold him

MAHON struggling Let me out Let me out the lot of you till I have
my vengeance on his head today

WIDOW QUIN  shaking him vehemently  Thats not your son Thats
a man is going to make a marriage with the daughter of this house a
place with fine trade with a license and with poteen too

MAHON  amazed That man marrying a decent and a moneyed girl Is it
mad yous are Is it in a crazyhouse for females that Im landed now

WIDOW QUIN Its mad yourself is with the blow upon your head That lad
is the wonder of the Western World

MAHON I seen its my son

WIDOW QUIN You seen that youre mad Cheering outside Do you hear
them cheering him in the zigzags of the road Arent you after saying
that your sons a fool and how would they be cheering a true idiot
born

MAHON  getting distressed  Its maybe out of reason that that
mans himself Cheering again Theres none surely will go cheering
him Oh Im raving with a madness that would fright the world He sits
down with his hand to his head There was one time I seen ten scarlet
divils letting on theyd cork my spirit in a gallon can and one time I
seen rats as big as badgers sucking the life blood from the butt of
my lug but I never till this day confused that dribbling idiot with a
likely man Im destroyed surely

WIDOW QUIN And whod wonder when its your brainpan that is gaping
now

MAHON Then the blight of the sacred drought upon myself and him for
I never went mad to this day and I not three weeks with the Limerick
girls drinking myself silly and parlatic from the dusk to dawn To
Widow Quin suddenly Is my visage astray

WIDOW QUIN It is then Youre a sniggering maniac a child could see

MAHON  getting up more cheerfully  Then Id best be going to
the union beyond and therell be a welcome before me I tell you with
great pride and I a terrible and fearful case the way that there I
was one time screeching in a straightened waistcoat with seven doctors
writing out my sayings in a printed book Would you believe that

WIDOW QUIN If youre a wonder itself youd best be hasty for them
lads caught a maniac one time and pelted the poor creature till he ran
out raving and foaming and was drowned in the sea

MAHON  with philosophy  Its true mankind is the divil when your
heads astray Let me out now and Ill slip down the boreen and not see
them so

WIDOW QUIN  showing him out  Thats it Run to the right and not
a one will see He runs off

PHILLY  wisely Youre at some gaming Widow Quin but Ill walk
after him and give him his dinner and a time to rest and Ill see then
if hes raving or as sane as you

WIDOW QUIN  annoyed If you go near that lad let you be wary of
your head Im saying Didnt you hear him telling he was crazed at
times

PHILLY I heard him telling a power and Im thinking well have right
sport before night will fall He goes out

JIMMY Well Phillys a conceited and foolish man How could that madman
have his senses and his brainpan slit Ill go after them and see him
turn on Philly now He goes Widow Quin hides poteen behind counter
Then hubbub outside

VOICES There you are Good jumper Grand lepper Darlint boy Hes the
racer Bear him on will you Christy comes in in Jockeys dress with
Pegeen Mike Sara and other girls and men

PEGEEN  to crowd  Go on now and dont destroy him and he
drenching with sweat Go along Im saying and have your tugofwarring
till hes dried his skin

CROWD Heres his prizes A bagpipes A fiddle was played by a poet in
the years gone by A flat and threethorned blackthorn would lick the
scholars out of Dublin town

CHRISTY  taking prizes from the men  Thank you kindly the lot of
you But youd say it was little only I did this day if youd seen me a
while since striking my one single blow

TOWN CRIER  outside ringing a bell  Take notice last event of
this day Tugofwarring on the green below Come on the lot of you
Great achievements for all Mayo men

PEGEEN Go on and leave him for to rest and dry Go on I tell you for
hell do no more She hustles crowd out Widow Quin following them

MEN  going  Come on then Good luck for the while

PEGEEN  radiantly wiping his face with her shawl  Well youre
the lad and youll have great times from this out when you could win
that wealth of prizes and you sweating in the heat of noon

CHRISTY  looking at her with delight  Ill have great times if
I win the crowning prize Im seeking now and thats your promise that
youll wed me in a fortnight when our banns is called

PEGEEN  backing away from him  Youve right daring to go ask
me that when all knows youll be starting to some girl in your own
townland when your fathers rotten in four months or five

CHRISTY  indignantly Starting from you is it He follows her
I will not then and when the airs is warming in four months or five
its then yourself and me should be pacing Neifin in the dews of night
the times sweet smells do be rising and youd see a little shiny new
moon maybe sinking on the hills

PEGEEN looking at him playfully  And its that kind of a poachers
love youd make Christy Mahon on the sides of Neifin when the night
is down

CHRISTY Its little youll think if my loves a poachers or an
earls itself when youll feel my two hands stretched around you and I
squeezing kisses on your puckered lips till Id feel a kind of pity for
the Lord God is all ages sitting lonesome in his golden chair

PEGEEN Thatll be right fun Christy Mahon and any girl would walk her
heart out before shed meet a young man was your like for eloquence or
talk at all

CHRISTY  encouraged Let you wait to hear me talking till were
astray in Erris when Good Fridays by drinking a sup from a well
and making mighty kisses with our wetted mouths or gaming in a gap
or sunshine with yourself stretched back unto your necklace in the
flowers of the earth

PEGEEN  in a lower voice moved by his tone  Id be nice so is
it

CHRISTY  with rapture  If the mitred bishops seen you that time
theyd be the like of the holy prophets Im thinking do be straining
the bars of Paradise to lay eyes on the Lady Helen of Troy and she
abroad pacing back and forward with a nosegay in her golden shawl

PEGEEN  with real tenderness  And what is it I have Christy
Mahon to make me fitting entertainment for the like of you that has
such poets talking and such bravery of heart

CHRISTY  in a low voice  Isnt there the light of seven heavens
in your heart alone the way youll be an angels lamp to me from this
out and I abroad in the darkness spearing salmons in the Owen or the
Carrowmore

PEGEEN If I was your wife Id be along with you those nights Christy
Mahon the way youd see I was a great hand at coaxing bailiffs or
coining funny nicknames for the stars of night

CHRISTY You is it Taking your death in the hailstones or in the fogs
of dawn

PEGEEN Yourself and me would shelter easy in a narrow bush with a
qualm of dread but were only talking maybe for this would be a poor
thatched place to hold a fine lad is the like of you

CHRISTY  putting his arm round her  If I wasnt a good Christian
its on my naked knees Id be saying my prayers and paters to every
jackstraw you have roofing your head and every stony pebble is paving
the laneway to your door

PEGEEN  radiantly If thats the truth Ill be burning candles from
this out to the miracles of God that have brought you from the south
today and I with my gowns bought ready the way that I can wed you
and not wait at all

CHRISTY Its miracles and thats the truth Me there toiling a long
while and walking a long while not knowing at all I was drawing all
times nearer to this holy day

PEGEEN And myself a girl was tempted often to go sailing the seas
till Id marry a Jewman with ten kegs of gold and I not knowing at
all there was the like of you drawing nearer like the stars of God

CHRISTY And to think Im long years hearing women talking that talk
to all bloody fools and this the first time Ive heard the like of your
voice talking sweetly for my own delight

PEGEEN And to think its me is talking sweetly Christy Mahon and I
the fright of seven townlands for my biting tongue Well the hearts a
wonder and Im thinking there wont be our like in Mayo for gallant
lovers from this hour today Drunken singing is heard outside
Theres my father coming from the wake and when hes had his sleep
well tell him for hes peaceful then They separate

MICHAEL  singing outside  The jailor and the turnkey They quickly
ran us down And brought us back as prisoners Once more to Cavan town
He comes in supported by Shawn There we lay bewailing All in a prison
bound He sees Christy Goes and shakes him drunkenly by the hand
while Pegeen and Shawn talk on the left

MICHAEL  to Christy  The blessing of God and the holy angels on
your head young fellow I hear tell youre after winning all in the
sports below and wasnt it a shame I didnt bear you along with me to
Kate Cassidys wake a fine stout lad the like of you for youd never
see the match of it for flows of drink the way when we sunk her bones
at noonday in her narrow grave there were five men aye and six men
stretched out retching speechless on the holy stones

CHRISTY  uneasily watching Pegeen  Is that the truth

MICHAEL It is then and arent you a louty schemer to go burying your
poor father unbeknownst when youd a right to throw him on the crupper
of a Kerry mule and drive him westwards like holy Joseph in the days
gone by the way we could have given him a decent burial and not have
him rotting beyond and not a Christian drinking a smart drop to the
glory of his soul

CHRISTY  gruffly Its well enough hes lying for the likes of him

MICHAEL  slapping him on the back  Well arent you a hardened
slayer Itll be a poor thing for the household man where you go
sniffing for a female wife and pointing to Shawn look beyond at that
shy and decent Christian I have chosen for my daughters hand and I
after getting the gilded dispensation this day for to wed them now

CHRISTY And youll be wedding them this day is it

MICHAEL  drawing himself up  Aye Are you thinking if Im drunk
itself Id leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal
is the like of you

PEGEEN  breaking away from Shawn  Is it the truth the
dispensations come

MICHAEL  triumphantly Father Reillys after reading it in gallous
Latin and Its come in the nick of time says he so Ill wed them
in a hurry dreading that young gaffer whod capsize the stars

PEGEEN  fiercely Hes missed his nick of time for its that lad
Christy Mahon that Im wedding now

MICHAEL  loudly with horror  Youd be making him a son to me and
he wet and crusted with his fathers blood

PEGEEN Aye Wouldnt it be a bitter thing for a girl to go marrying the
like of Shaneen and he a middling kind of a scarecrow with no savagery
or fine words in him at all

MICHAEL  gasping and sinking on a chair  Oh arent you a heathen
daughter to go shaking the fat of my heart and I swamped and drownded
with the weight of drink Would you have them turning on me the way that
Id be roaring to the dawn of day with the wind upon my heart Have you
not a word to aid me Shaneen Are you not jealous at all

SHANEEN  In great misery  Id be afeard to be jealous of a man
did slay his da

PEGEEN Well itd be a poor thing to go marrying your like Im seeing
theres a world of peril for an orphan girl and isnt it a great
blessing I didnt wed you before himself came walking from the west or
south

SHAWN Its a queer story youd go picking a dirty tramp up from the
highways of the world

PEGEEN  playfully And you think youre a likely beau to go straying
along with the shiny Sundays of the opening year when its sooner on
a bullocks liver youd put a poor girl thinking than on the lily or the
rose

SHAWN And have you no mind of my weight of passion and the holy
dispensation and the drift of heifers I am giving and the golden ring

PEGEEN Im thinking youre too fine for the like of me Shawn Keogh of
Killakeen and let you go off till youd find a radiant lady with droves
of bullocks on the plains of Meath and herself bedizened in the diamond
jewelleries of Pharaohs ma Thatd be your match Shaneen So God save
you now She retreats behind Christy

SHAWN Wont you hear me telling you

CHRISTY  with ferocity  Take yourself from this young fellow or
Ill maybe add a murder to my deeds today

MICHAEL  springing up with a shriek  Murder is it Is it mad yous
are Would you go making murder in this place and it piled with poteen
for our drink tonight Go on to the foreshore if its fighting you
want where the rising tide will wash all traces from the memory of man
Pushing Shawn towards Christy

SHAWN  shaking himself free and getting behind Michael  Ill
not fight him Michael James Id liefer live a bachelor simmering in
passions to the end of time than face a lepping savage the like of him
has descended from the Lord knows where Strike him yourself Michael
James or youll lose my drift of heifers and my blue bull from Sneem

MICHAEL Is it me fight him when its fatherslaying hes bred to now
Pushing Shawn Go on you fool and fight him now

SHAWN  coming forward a little  Will I strike him with my hand

MICHAEL Take the loy is on your western side

SHAWN Id be afeard of the gallows if I struck him with that

CHRISTY  taking up the loy  Then Ill make you face the gallows
or quit off from this Shawn flies out of the door

CHRISTY Well fine weather be after him going to Michael coaxingly
and Im thinking you wouldnt wish to have that quaking blackguard in
your house at all Let you give us your blessing and hear her swear her
faith to me for Im mounted on the springtide of the stars of luck
the way itll be good for any to have me in the house

PEGEEN at the other side of Michael  Bless us now for I swear to
God Ill wed him and Ill not renege

MICHAEL  standing up in the centre holding on to both of them 
Its the will of God Im thinking that all should win an easy or a
cruel end and its the will of God that all should rear up lengthy
families for the nurture of the earth Whats a single man I ask you
eating a bit in one house and drinking a sup in another and he with no
place of his own like an old braying jackass strayed upon the rocks
To Christy Its many would be in dread to bring your like into their
house for to end them maybe with a sudden end but Im a decent man
of Ireland and I liefer face the grave untimely and I seeing a score of
grandsons growing up little gallant swearers by the name of God than
go peopling my bedside with puny weeds the like of what youd breed Im
thinking out of Shaneen Keogh He joins their hands A daring fellow
is the jewel of the world and a man did split his fathers middle with
a single clout should have the bravery of ten so may God and Mary and
St Patrick bless you and increase you from this mortal day

CHRISTY AND PEGEEN Amen O Lord

Hubbub outside

Old Mahon rushes in followed by all the crowd and Widow Quin He
makes a rush at Christy knocks him down and begins to beat him

PEGEEN  dragging back his arm  Stop that will you Who are you
at all

MAHON His father God forgive me

PEGEEN  drawing back  Is it rose from the dead

MAHON Do you think I look so easy quenched with the tap of a loy
Beats Christy again

PEGEEN  glaring at Christy  And its lies you told letting on
you had him slitted and you nothing at all

CHRISTY  clutching Mahons stick  Hes not my father Hes a
raving maniac would scare the world Pointing to Widow Quin Herself
knows it is true

CROWD Youre fooling Pegeen The Widow Quin seen him this day and you
likely knew Youre a liar

CHRISTY  dumbfounded Its himself was a liar lying stretched out
with an open head on him letting on he was dead

MAHON Werent you off racing the hills before I got my breath with the
start I had seeing you turn on me at all

PEGEEN And to think of the coaxing glory we had given him and he after
doing nothing but hitting a soft blow and chasing northward in a sweat
of fear Quit off from this

CHRISTY  piteously Youve seen my doings this day and let you save
me from the old man for why would you be in such a scorch of haste to
spur me to destruction now

PEGEEN Its there your treachery is spurring me till Im hard set to
think youre the one Im after lacing in my heartstrings halfanhour
gone by To Mahon Take him on from this for I think bad the world
should see me raging for a Munster liar and the fool of men

MAHON Rise up now to retribution and come on with me

CROWD  jeeringly Theres the playboy Theres the lad thought hed
rule the roost in Mayo Slate him now mister

CHRISTY  getting up in shy terror  What is it drives you to
torment me here when Id asked the thunders of the might of God to
blast me if I ever did hurt to any saving only that one single blow

MAHON  loudly If you didnt youre a poor goodfornothing and
isnt it by the like of you the sins of the whole world are committed

CHRISTY  raising his hands  In the name of the Almighty God

MAHON Leave troubling the Lord God Would you have him sending down
droughts and fevers and the old hen and the cholera morbus

CHRISTY  to Widow Quin  Will you come between us and protect me
now

WIDOW QUIN Ive tried a lot God help me and my share is done

CHRISTY  looking round in desperation  And I must go back into
my torment is it or run off like a vagabond straying through the Unions
with the dusts of August making mudstains in the gullet of my throat
or the winds of March blowing on me till Id take an oath I felt them
making whistles of my ribs within

SARA Ask Pegeen to aid you Her like does often change

CHRISTY I will not then for theres torment in the splendour of her
like and she a girl any moon of midnight would take pride to meet
facing southwards on the heaths of Keel But what did I want crawling
forward to scorch my understanding at her flaming brow

PEGEEN  to Mahon vehemently fearing she will break into tears 
Take him on from this or Ill set the young lads to destroy him here

MAHON  going to him shaking his stick  Come on now if you

PEGEEN  half laughing through her tears  Thats it now the
world will see him pandied and he an ugly liar was playing off the
hero and the fright of men

CROWD Keep it up the two of you Ill back the old one Now the
playboy

CHRISTY  in low and intense voice  Shut your yelling for if
youre after making a mighty man of me this day by the power of a lie
youre setting me now to think if its a poor thing to be lonesome
its worse maybe to go mixing with the fools of earth Mahon makes a
movement towards him

CHRISTY  almost shouting  Keep off lest I do show a blow
unto the lot of you would set the guardian angels winking in the clouds
above He swings round with a sudden rapid movement and picks up a
loy

CROWD  half frightened half amused  Hes going mad Mind
yourselves Run from the idiot

CHRISTY If I am an idiot Im after hearing my voice this day saying
words would raise the topknot on a poet in a merchants town Ive won
your racing and your lepping and

MAHON Shut your gullet and come on with me

CHRISTY Im going but Ill stretch you first He runs at old Mahon
with the loy chases him out of the door followed by crowd and Widow
Quin There is a great noise outside then a yell and dead silence for
a moment Christy comes in half dazed and goes to fire

WIDOW QUIN  coming in hurriedly and going to him  Theyre
turning again you Come on or youll be hanged indeed

CHRISTY Im thinking from this out Pegeenll be giving me praises the
same as in the hours gone by

WIDOW QUIN  impatiently Come by the backdoor Id think bad to
have you stifled on the gallows tree

CHRISTY  indignantly I will not then What goodd be my lifetime
if I left Pegeen

WIDOW QUIN Come on and youll be no worse than you were last night
and you with a double murder this time to be telling to the girls

CHRISTY Ill not leave Pegeen Mike

WIDOW QUIN  impatiently Isnt there the match of her in every
parish public from Binghamstown unto the plain of Meath Come on I
tell you and Ill find you finer sweethearts at each waning moon

CHRISTY Its Pegeen Im seeking only and whatd I care if you brought
me a drift of chosen females standing in their shifts itself maybe
from this place to the Eastern World

SARA  runs in pulling off one of her petticoats  Theyre going
to hang him Holding out petticoat and shawl Fit these upon him and
let him run off to the east

WIDOW QUIN Hes raving now but well fit them on him and Ill take
him in the ferry to the Achill boat

CHRISTY  struggling feebly  Leave me go will you when Im
thinking of my luck today for she will wed me surely and I a proven
hero in the end of all They try to fasten petticoat round him

WIDOW QUIN Take his left hand and well pull him now Come on young
fellow

CHRISTY  suddenly starting up  Youll be taking me from her
Youre jealous is it of her wedding me Go on from this He snatches
up a stool and threatens them with it

WIDOW QUIN  going  Its in the madhouse they should put him
not in jail at all Well go by the backdoor to call the doctor and
well save him so She goes out with Sara through inner room Men
crowd in the doorway Christy sits down again by the fire

MICHAEL  in a terrified whisper  Is the old lad killed surely

PHILLY Im after feeling the last gasps quitting his heart They peer
in at Christy

MICHAEL  with a rope  Look at the way he is Twist a hangmans
knot on it and slip it over his head while hes not minding at all

PHILLY Let you take it Shaneen Youre the soberest of all thats
here

SHAWN Is it me to go near him and he the wickedest and worst with me
Let you take it Pegeen Mike

PEGEEN Come on so She goes forward with the others and they drop
the double hitch over his head

CHRISTY What ails you

SHAWN  triumphantly as they pull the rope tight on his arms 
Come on to the peelers till they stretch you now

CHRISTY Me

MICHAEL If we took pity on you the Lord God would maybe bring us
ruin from the law today so youd best come easy for hanging is an
easy and a speedy end

CHRISTY Ill not stir To Pegeen And what is it youll say to me
and I after doing it this time in the face of all

PEGEEN Ill say a strange man is a marvel with his mighty talk but
whats a squabble in your backyard and the blow of a loy have taught
me that theres a great gap between a gallous story and a dirty deed
To Men Take him on from this or the lot of us will be likely put on
trial for his deed today

CHRISTY  with horror in his voice  And its yourself will send me
off to have a hornyfingered hangman hitching his bloody slipknots at
the butt of my ear

MEN  pulling rope  Come on will you He is pulled down on the
floor

CHRISTY  twisting his legs round the table  Cut the rope Pegeen
and Ill quit the lot of you and live from this out like the madmen of
Keel eating muck and green weeds on the faces of the cliffs

PEGEEN And leave us to hang is it for a saucy liar the like of you
To men Take him on out from this

SHAWN Pull a twist on his neck and squeeze him so

PHILLY Twist yourself Sure he cannot hurt you if you keep your
distance from his teeth alone

SHAWN Im afeard of him To Pegeen Lift a lighted sod will you and
scorch his leg

PEGEEN  blowing the fire with a bellows Leave go now young
fellow or Ill scorch your shins

CHRISTY Youre blowing for to torture me His voice rising and growing
stronger Thats your kind is it Then let the lot of you be wary
for if Ive to face the gallows Ill have a gay march down I tell
you and shed the blood of some of you before I die

SHAWN  in terror  Keep a good hold Philly Be wary for the love
of God For Im thinking he would liefest wreak his pains on me

CHRISTY  almost gaily  If I do lay my hands on you its the way
youll be at the fall of night hanging as a scarecrow for the fowls of
hell Ah youll have a gallous jaunt Im saying coaching out through
Limbo with my fathers ghost

SHAWN  to Pegeen  Make haste will you Oh isnt he a holy
terror and isnt it true for Father Reilly that all drinks a curse
that has the lot of you so shaky and uncertain now

CHRISTY If I can wring a neck among you Ill have a royal judgment
looking on the trembling jury in the courts of law And wont there be
crying out in Mayo the day Im stretched upon the rope with ladies in
their silks and satins snivelling in their lacy kerchiefs and they
rhyming songs and ballads on the terror of my fate He squirms round on
the floor and bites Shawns leg

SHAWN  shrieking My legs bit on me Hes the like of a mad dog
Im thinking the way that I will surely die

CHRISTY  delighted with himself  You will then the way you can
shake out hells flags of welcome for my coming in two weeks or three
for Im thinking Satan hasnt many have killed their da in Kerry and
in Mayo too Old Mahon comes in behind on all fours and looks on
unnoticed

MEN  to Pegeen  Bring the sod will you

PEGEEN coming over  God help him so Burns his leg

CHRISTY  kicking and screaming  O glory be to God He kicks
loose from the table and they all drag him towards the door

JIMMY  seeing old Mahon  Will you look whats come in They all
drop Christy and run left

CHRISTY  scrambling on his knees face to face with old Mahon  Are
you coming to be killed a third time or what ails you now

MAHON For what is it they have you tied

CHRISTY Theyre taking me to the peelers to have me hanged for slaying
you

MICHAEL  apologetically It is the will of God that all should
guard their little cabins from the treachery of law and what would my
daughter be doing if I was ruined or was hanged itself

MAHON  grimly loosening Christy  Its little I care if you put a
bag on her back and went picking cockles till the hour of death but
my son and myself will be going our own way and well have great times
from this out telling stories of the villainy of Mayo and the fools is
here To Christy who is freed Come on now

CHRISTY Go with you is it I will then like a gallant captain with
his heathen slave Go on now and Ill see you from this day stewing my
oatmeal and washing my spuds for Im master of all fights from now
Pushing Mahon Go on Im saying

MAHON Is it me

CHRISTY Not a word out of you Go on from this

MAHON walking out and looking back at Christy over his shoulder 
Glory be to God With a broad smile I am crazy again Goes

CHRISTY Ten thousand blessings upon all thats here for youve turned
me a likely gaffer in the end of all the way Ill go romancing through
a romping lifetime from this hour to the dawning of the judgment day
He goes out

MICHAEL By the will of God well have peace now for our drinks Will
you draw the porter Pegeen

SHAWN  going up to her  Its a miracle Father Reilly can wed us
in the end of all and well have none to trouble us when his vicious
bite is healed

PEGEEN  hitting him a box on the ear  Quit my sight Putting
her shawl over her head and breaking out into wild lamentations Oh my
grief Ive lost him surely Ive lost the only Playboy of the Western
World
