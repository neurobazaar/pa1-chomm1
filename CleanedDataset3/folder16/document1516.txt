a team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers


Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

ACT I

SCENE I London A Room in the Palace

Enter the King Henry Westmoreland Sir Walter Blunt and
others

KING
So shaken as we are so wan with care
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant
And breathe shortwinded accents of new broils
To be commenced in strands afar remote
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
Shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood
No more shall trenching war channel her fields
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
Of hostile paces those opposed eyes
Which like the meteors of a troubled heaven
All of one nature of one substance bred
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
And furious close of civil butchery
Shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks
March all one way and be no more opposed
Against acquaintance kindred and allies
The edge of war like an illsheathed knife
No more shall cut his master Therefore friends
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ
Whose soldier now under whose blessed cross
We are impressed and engaged to fight
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
Over whose acres walkd those blessed feet
Which fourteen hundred years ago were naild
For our advantage on the bitter cross
But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old
And bootless tis to tell you we will go
Therefore we meet not nowThen let me hear
Of you my gentle cousin Westmoreland
What yesternight our Council did decree
In forwarding this dear expedience

WEST
My liege this haste was hot in question
And many limits of the charge set down
But yesternight when all athwart there came
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news
Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Against th irregular and wild Glendower
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken
A thousand of his people butchered
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
Such beastly shameless transformation
By those Welshwomen done as may not be
Without much shame retold or spoken of

KING
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
Brake off our business for the Holy Land

WEST
This matchd with other did my gracious lord
For more uneven and unwelcome news
Came from the North and thus it did import
On Holyrood day the gallant Hotspur there
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald
That evervaliant and approved Scot
At Holmedon met
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
As by discharge of their artillery
And shape of likelihood the news was told
For he that brought them in the very heat
And pride of their contention did take horse
Uncertain of the issue any way

KING
Here is a dear and trueindustrious friend
Sir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse
Staind with the variation of each soil
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited
Ten thousand bold Scots twoandtwenty knights
Balkd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
On Holmedons plains of prisoners Hotspur took
Mordake the Earl of Fife and eldest son
To beaten Douglas and the Earls of Athol
Of Murray Angus and Menteith
And is not this an honourable spoil
A gallant prize ha cousin is it not

WEST
Faith tis a conquest for a prince to boast of

KING
Yea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Should be the father to so blest a son
A son who is the theme of honours tongue
Amongst a grove the very straightest plant
Who is sweet Fortunes minion and her pride
Whilst I by looking on the praise of him
See riot and dishonour stain the brow
Of my young Harry O that it could be proved
That some nighttripping fairy had exchanged
In cradleclothes our children where they lay
And calld mine Percy his Plantagenet
Then would I have his Harry and he mine
But let him from my thoughts What think you coz
Of this young Percys pride the prisoners
Which he in this adventure hath surprised
To his own use he keeps and sends me word
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife

WEST
This is his uncles teaching this is Worcester
Malevolent to you in all aspects
Which makes him prune himself and bristle up
The crest of youth against your dignity

KING
But I have sent for him to answer this
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem
Cousin on Wednesday next our Council we
Will hold at Windsor so inform the lords
But come yourself with speed to us again
For more is to be said and to be done
Than out of anger can be uttered

WEST
I will my liege


Exeunt



Scene II The same An Apartment of Prince Henrys

Enter Prince Henry and Falstaff

FAL
Now Hal what time of day is it lad

PRINCE
Thou art so fatwitted with drinking of old sack and
unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches
after noon that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which
thou wouldst truly know What a devil hast thou to do with the
time of the day unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
capons and the blessed Sun himself a fair hot wench in
flamecoloured taffeta I see no reason why thou shouldst be
so superfluous to demand the time of the day

FAL
Indeed you come near me now Hal for we that take purses go
by the Moon and the seven stars and not by Phoebushe that
wandering knight so fair And I prythee sweet wag when thou
art kingas God save thy GraceMajesty I should say for
grace
thou wilt have none

PRINCE
What none

FAL
No by my troth not so much as will serve to be prologue
to an egg and butter

PRINCE
Well how then come roundly roundly

FAL
Marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not us that
are squires of the nights body be called thieves of the days
beauty let us be Dianas foresters gentlemen of the shade
minions of the Moon and let men say we be men of good
government being governed as the sea is by our noble and
chaste mistress the Moon under whose countenance we steal


PRINCE
Thou sayst well and it holds well too for the fortune of
us that are the Moons men doth ebb and flow like the sea
being governed as the sea is by the Moon As for proof now A
purse of gold most resolutely snatchd on Monday night and most
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning got with swearing Lay by
and spent with crying Bring in now ill as low an ebb as the foot
of the ladder and byandby in as high a flow as the ridge of the
gallows

FAL
By the Lord thou sayst true lad And is not my hostess of the
tavern a most sweet wench

PRINCE
As the honey of Hybla my old lad of the castle And is not a
buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance

FAL
How now how now mad wag what in thy quips and thy
quiddities what a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin

PRINCE
Why what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern

FAL
Well thou hast calld her to a reckoning many a time and oft

PRINCE
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part

FAL
No Ill give thee thy due thou hast paid all there

PRINCE
Yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch
and where it would not I have used my credit

FAL
Yea and so used it that were it not here apparent that
thou art heirapparentBut I prythee sweet wag shall there be
gallows standing in England when thou art king and
resolution thus fobbd as it is with the rusty curb of old father
antic the law Do not thou when thou art king hang a thief

PRINCE
No thou shalt

FAL
Shall I O rare By the Lord Ill be a brave judge

PRINCE
Thou judgest false already I mean thou shalt have the
hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman

FAL
Well Hal well and in some sort it jumps with my humour
as well as waiting in the Court I can tell you

PRINCE
For obtaining of suits

FAL
Yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman hath no
lean wardrobe Sblood I am as melancholy as a gibcat or a
luggd bear

PRINCE
Or an old lion or a lovers lute

FAL
Yea or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe

PRINCE
What sayst thou to a hare or the melancholy of Moorditch

FAL
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the
most comparative rascalliest sweet young princeBut Hal I
prythee trouble me no more with vanity I would to God thou and
I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought An old
lord of the Council rated me the other day in the street about you
sirbut I markd him not and yet he talkd very wiselybut I
regarded him not and yet he talkd wisely and in the street too

PRINCE
Thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man
regards it

FAL
O thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to corrupt
a saint
Thou hast done much harm upon me Hal God forgive thee for it
Before I knew thee Hal I knew nothing and now am I if a man
should speak truly little better than one of the wicked I must
give over this life and I will give it over by the Lord an I do
not I am a villain Ill be damnd for never a kings son in
Christendom

PRINCE
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow Jack

FAL
Zounds where thou wilt lad Ill make one an I do not call
me villain and baffle me

PRINCE
I see a good amendment of life in theefrom praying to
pursetaking

FAL
Why Hal tis my vocation Hal tis no sin for a man to labour
in his vocation

Enter Pointz

PointzNow shall we know if Gadshill have set a match O if
men were to be saved by merit what hole in Hell were hot enough
for him This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried
Stand to a true man

PRINCE
Good morrow Ned

POINTZ
Good morrow sweet HalWhat says Monsieur Remorse what
says Sir John Sackandsugar Jack how agrees the Devil and
thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on GoodFriday last
for a cup of Madeira and a cold capons leg

PRINCE
Sir John stands to his wordthe Devil shall have his bargain
for he was never yet a breaker of proverbshe will give the
Devil his due

POINTZ
Then art thou damnd for keeping thy word with the Devil

PRINCE
Else he had been damnd for cozening the Devil


POINTZ
But my lads my lads tomorrow morning by four oclock
early at Gadshill there are pilgrims gong to Canterbury
with rich offerings and traders riding to London with fat
purses I have visards for you all you have horses for
yourselves Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester I have bespoke
supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap we may do it as secure as
sleep If you will go I will stuff your purses full of crowns
if you will not tarry at home and be hangd

FAL
Hear ye Yedward if I tarry at home and go not Ill hang you
for going

POINTZ
You will chops

FAL
Hal wilt thou make one

PRINCE
Who I rob I a thief not I by my faith

FAL
Theres neither honesty manhood nor good fellowship in thee
nor thou camest not of the blood royal if thou darest not stand
for ten shillings

PRINCE
Well then once in my days Ill be a madcap

FAL
Why thats well said

PRINCE
Well come what will Ill tarry at home

FAL
By the Lord Ill be a traitor then when thou art king

PRINCE
I care not

POINTZ

Sir John I prythee leave the Prince and me alone I will
lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go

FAL
Well God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears
of profiting that what thou speakest may move and what he
hears may be believed that the true Prince may for recreation
sake prove a false thief for the poor abuses of the time want
countenance Farewell you shall find me in Eastcheap

PRINCE
Farewell thou latter Spring farewell Allhallown Summer

Exit Falstaff

POINTZ
Now my good sweet honeylord ride with us tomorrow I
have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone Falstaff
Bardolph Peto and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have
already waylaid yourself and I will not be there and when they
have the booty if you and I do not rob them cut this head off
from my shoulders

PRINCE
But how shall we part with them in setting forth

POINTZ
Why we will set forth before or after them and appoint them
a place of meeting wherein it is at our pleasure to fail and
then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves which they
shall have no sooner achieved but well set upon them

PRINCE
Ay but tis like that they will know us by our horses by our
habits and by every other appointment to be ourselves

POINTZ
Tut our horses they shall not seeIll tie them in the wood
our visards we will change after we leave them and sirrah I
have cases of buckram for the nonce to immask our noted
outward garments

PRINCE
But I doubt they will be too hard for us

POINTZ
Well for two of them I know them to be as truebred
cowards as ever turnd back and for the third if he fight
longer than he sees reason Ill forswear arms The virtue of
this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat
rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at least
he fought with what wards what blows what extremities he
endured and in the reproof of this lies the jest

PRINCE
Well Ill go with thee provide us all things necessary and
meet me tonight in Eastcheap there Ill sup Farewell

POINTZ
Farewell my lord

Exit

PRINCE
I know you all and will awhile uphold
The unyokd humour of your idleness
Yet herein will I imitate the Sun
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
To smotherup his beauty from the world
That when he please again to be himself
Being wanted he may be more wonderd at
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him
If all the year were playing holidays
To sport would be as tedious as to work
But when they seldom come they wishdfor come
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
So when this loose behaviour I throw off
And pay the debt I never promised
By how much better than my word I am
By so much shall I falsify mens hopes
And like bright metal on a sullen ground
My reformation glittering oer my fault
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
Than that which hath no foil to set it off
Ill so offend to make offence a skill
Redeeming time when men think least I will

Exit




Scene III The Same A Room in the Palace

Enter King Henry Northumberland Worcester Hotspur Sir Walter
Blunt and others

KING
My blood hath been too cold and temperate
Unapt to stir at these indignities
And you have found me for accordingly
You tread upon my patience but be sure
I will from henceforth rather be myself
Mighty and to be feard than my condition
Which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
And therefore lost that title of respect
Which the proud soul neer pays but to the proud

WOR
Our House my sovereign liege little deserves
The scourge of greatness to be used on it
And that same greatness too which our own hands
Have holp to make so portly

NORTH
My good lord

KING
Worcester get thee gone for I do see
Danger and disobedience in thine eye
O sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
And majesty might never yet endure
The moody frontier of a servant brow
You have good leave to leave us when we need
Your use and counsel we shall send for you

Exit Worcester

To Northumberland

You were about to speak

NORTH
Yea my good lord
Those prisoners in your Highness name demanded
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took
Were as he says not with such strength denied
As is deliverd to your Majesty
Either envy therefore or misprision
Is guilty of this fault and not my son

HOT
My liege I did deny no prisoners
But I remember when the fight was done
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil
Breathless and faint leaning upon my sword
Came there a certain lord neat trimly dressd
Fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reapd
Showd like a stubbleland at harvesthome
He was perfumed like a milliner
And twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncetbox which ever and anon
He gave his nose and tookt away again
Who therewith angry when it next came there
Took it in snuff and still he smiled and talkd
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
He calld them untaught knaves unmannerly
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Betwixt the wind and his nobility
With many holiday and lady terms
He questiond me amongst the rest demanded
My prisoners in your Majestys behalf
I then all smarting with my wounds being cold
Out of my grief and my impatience
To be so pesterd with a popinjay
Answerd neglectingly I know not what
He should or he should not fort made me mad
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
And talk so like a waitinggentlewoman
Of guns and drums and woundsGod save the mark
And telling me the sovereignst thing on Earth
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise
And that it was great pity so it was
This villainous saltpetre should be diggd
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth
Which many a good tall fellow had destroyd
So cowardly and but for these vile guns
He would himself have been a soldier
This bald unjointed chat of his my lord
I answered indirectly as I said
And I beseech you let not his report
Come current for an accusation
Betwixt my love and your high Majesty

BLUNT
The circumstance considerd good my lord
Whatever Harry Percy then had said
To such a person and in such a place
At such a time with all the rest retold
May reasonably die and never rise
To do him wrong or any way impeach
What then he said so he unsay it now

KING
Why yet he doth deny his prisoners
But with proviso and exception
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
His brotherinlaw the foolish Mortimer
Who on my soul hath wilfully betrayd
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Against that great magician damnd Glendower
Whose daughter as we hear the Earl of March
Hath lately married Shall our coffers then
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home
Shall we buy treason and indent with fears
When they have lost and forfeited themselves
No on the barren mountains let him starve
For I shall never hold that man my friend
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
To ransom home revolted Mortimer

HOT
Revolted Mortimer
He never did fall off my sovereign liege
But by the chance of war to prove that true
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
Those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
When on the gentle Severns sedgy bank
In single opposition hand to hand
He did confound the best part of an hour
In changing hardiment with great Glendower
Three times they breathed and three times did they drink
Upon agreement of swift Severns flood
Who then affrighted with their bloody looks
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants
Never did base and rotten policy
Colour her working with such deadly wounds
Nor never could the noble Mortimer
Receive so many and all willingly
Then let not him be slanderd with revolt

KING
Thou dost belie him Percy thou dost belie him
He never did encounter with Glendower
I tell thee
He durst as well have met the Devil alone
As Owen Glendower for an enemy
Art not ashamed But sirrah henceforth
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
As will displease youMy Lord Northumberland
We license your departure with your son
Send us your prisoners or youll hear of it

Exeunt King Henry Blunt and train

HOT
An if the Devil come and roar for them
I will not send them I will after straight
And tell him so for I will else my heart
Although it be with hazard of my head

NORTH
What drunk with choler stay and pause awhile
Here comes your uncle

Reenter Worcester

HOT
Speak of Mortimer
Zounds I will speak of him and let my soul
Want mercy if I do not join with him
Yea on his part Ill empty all these veins
And shed my dear blood drop by drop i the dust
But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer
As high i the air as this unthankful King
As this ingrate and cankerd Bolingbroke

NORTH

To Worcester

Brother the King hath made your nephew mad

WOR
Who struck this heat up after I was gone

HOT
He will forsooth have all my prisoners
And when I urged the ransom once again
Of my wifes brother then his cheek lookd pale
And on my face he turnd an eye of death
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer

WOR
I cannot blame him was not he proclaimd
By Richard that dead is the next of blood

NORTH
He was I heard the proclamation
And then it was when the unhappy King
Whose wrongs in us God pardondid set forth
Upon his Irish expedition
From whence he intercepted did return
To be deposed and shortly murdered

WOR
And for whose death we in the worlds wide mouth
Live scandalized and foully spoken of

HOT
But soft I pray you did King Richard then
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
Heir to the crown

NORTH
He did myself did hear it

HOT
Nay then I cannot blame his cousin King
That wishd him on the barren mountains starve
But shall it be that you that set the crown
Upon the head of this forgetful man
And for his sake wear the detested blot
Of murderous subornationshall it be
That you a world of curses undergo
Being the agents or base second means
The cords the ladder or the hangman rather
O pardon me that I descend so low
To show the line and the predicament
Wherein you range under this subtle King
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days
Or fill up chronicles in time to come
That men of your nobility and power
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf
As both of you God pardon it have done
To put down Richard that sweet lovely rose
And plant this thorn this canker Bolingbroke
And shall it in more shame be further spoken
That you are foold discarded and shook off
By him for whom these shames ye underwent
No yet time serves wherein you may redeem
Your banishd honours and restore yourselves
Into the good thoughts of the world again
Revenge the jeering and disdaind contempt
Of this proud King who studies day and night
To answer all the debt he owes to you
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths
Therefore I say

WOR
Peace cousin say no more
And now I will unclasp a secret book
And to your quickconceiving discontent
Ill read you matter deep and dangerous
As full of peril and adventurous spirit
As to oerwalk a current roaring loud
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear

HOT
If we fall in good night or sink or swim
Send danger from the east unto the west
So honour cross it from the north to south
And let them grapple O the blood more stirs
To rouse a lion than to start a hare

NORTH
Imagination of some great exploit
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience

HOT
By Heaven methinks it were an easy leap
To pluck bright honour from the palefaced Moon
Or dive into the bottom of the deep
Where fathomline could never touch the ground
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
Without corrival all her dignities
But out upon this halffaced fellowship

WOR
He apprehends a world of figures here
But not the form of what he should attend
Good cousin give me audience for a while

HOT
I cry you mercy

WOR
Those same noble Scots
That are your prisoners

HOT
Ill keep them all
By God he shall not have a Scot of them
No if a Scot would save his soul he shall not
Ill keep them by this hand

WOR
You start away
And lend no ear unto my purposes
Those prisoners you shall keep

HOT
Nay I will thats flat
He said he would not ransom Mortimer
Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer
But I will find him when he lies asleep
And in his ear Ill holla Mortimer
Nay
Ill have a starling shall be taught to speak
Nothing but Mortimer and give it him
To keep his anger still in motion


WOR
Hear you cousin a word

HOT
All studies here I solemnly defy
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke
And that same swordandbuckler Prince of Wales
But that I think his father loves him not
And would be glad he met with some mischance
Id have him poisond with a pot of ale

WOR
Farewell kinsman I will talk to you
When you are better temperd to attend

NORTH
Why what a waspstung and impatient fool
Art thou to break into this womans mood
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own

HOT
Why look you I am whippd and scourged with rods
Nettled and stung with pismires when I hear
Of this vile politician Bolingbroke
In Richards timewhat do you call the place
A plague upontit is in Gioucestershire
Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept
His uncle Yorkwhere I first bowd my knee
Unto this king of smiles this Bolingbroke
When you and he came back from Ravenspurg

NORTH
At Berkeleycastle

HOT
You say true
Why what a candy deal of courtesy
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me
Look when his infant fortune came to age
And Gentle Harry Percy and kind cousin
O the Devil take such cozenersGod forgive me
Good uncle tell your tale for I have done

WOR
Nay if you have not tot again
Well stay your leisure

HOT
I have done ifaith

WOR
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners
Deliver them up without their ransom straight
And make the Douglas son your only mean
For powers in Scotland which for divers reasons
Which I shall send you written be assured
Will easily be granted
To Northumberland You my lord
Your son in Scotland being thus employd
Shall secretly into the bosom creep
Of that same noble prelate well beloved
Th Archbishop

HOT
Of York ist not

WOR
True who bears hard
His brothers death at Bristol the Lord Scroop
I speak not this in estimation
As what I think might be but what I know
Is ruminated plotted and set down
And only stays but to behold the face
Of that occasion that shall bring it on

HOT
I smellt upon my life it will do well

NORTH
Before the games afoot thou still lettst slip

HOT
Why it cannot choose but be a noble plot
And then the power of Scotland and of York
To join with Mortimer ha

WOR
And so they shall

HOT

In faith it is exceedingly well aimd

WOR
And tis no little reason bids us speed
To save our heads by raising of a head
For bear ourselves as even as we can
The King will always think him in our debt
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied
Till he hath found a time to pay us home
And see already how he doth begin
To make us strangers to his looks of love

HOT
He does he does well be revenged on him

WOR
Cousin farewell no further go in this
Than I by letters shall direct your course
When time is ripe which will be suddenly
Ill steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once
As I will fashion it shall happily meet
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms
Which now we hold at much uncertainty

NORTH
Farewell good brother we shall thrive I trust

HOT
Uncle adieu O let the hours be short
Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport

Exeunt

How now Kate I must leave you within these two hours


LADY
O my good lord why are you thus alone
For what offence have I this fortnight been
A banishd woman from my Harrys bed
Tell me sweet lord what ist that takes from thee
Thy stomach pleasure and thy golden sleep
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth
And start so often when thou sittst alone
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
To thickeyed musing and curst melancholy
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watchd
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed
Cry Courage to the field And thou hast talkd
Of sallies and retires of trenches tents
Of palisadoes frontiers parapets
Of basilisks of cannon culverin
Of prisoners ransomed and of soldiers slain
And all the currents of a heady fight
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
And thus hath so bestirrd thee in thy sleep
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
Like bubbles in a latedisturbed stream
And in thy face strange motions have appeard
Such as we see when men restrain their breath
On some great sudden hest O what portents are these
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand
And I must know it else he loves me not

HOT
What ho

To line his enterprise but if you go

HOT
So far afoot I shall be weary love

LADY

Directly to this question that I ask
In faith Ill break thy little finger Harry
An if thou wilt not tell me true

HOT
Away

I care not for thee Kate this is no world
To play with mammets and to tilt with lips
We must have bloody noses and crackd crowns
And pass them current tooGods me my horse
What sayst thou Kate what wouldst thou have with me

LADY
Do you not love me do you not indeed
Well do not then for since you love me not
I will not love myself Do you not love me
Nay tell me if you speak in jest or no

HOT
Come wilt thou see me ride
And when I am o horseback I will swear
I love thee infinitely But hark you Kate
I must not have you henceforth question me
Whither I go nor reason whereabout
Whither I must I must and to conclude
This evening must I leave you gentle Kate
I know you wise but yet no further wise
Than Harry Percys wife constant you are
But yet a woman and for secrecy
No lady closer for I well believe
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know
And so far will I trust thee gentle Kate

LADY
How so far

HOT
Not an inch further But hark you Kate
Whither I go thither shall you go too
Today will I set forth tomorrow you
Will this content you Kate

POINTZ

Then did we two set on you four and with a word outfaced you from

and Falstaff you carried yourself away as nimbly with as quick
dexterity and roared for mercy and still ran and roard as ever I
heard bullcalf What a slave art thou to hack thy sword as thou
hast done and then say it was in fight

my masters
Was it for me to kill the heirapparent should I turn upon the
true Prince why thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules but

valiant lion and thou for a true prince But by the Lord lads
I am glad you have the money
To Hostess within Hostess clapto the doors watch

BARD

PRINCE
Tell me now in earnest how came Falstaffs sword so hackd

PETO
Why he hackd it with his dagger and said he would swear truth out of
England but he would make you believe it was done in fight and
persuaded us to do the like

BARD
Yea and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them bleed
and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was the
blood of true men I did that I did not this seven year before
I blushd to hear his monstrous devices

PRINCE
O villain thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago and wert
taken with the manner and ever since thou hast blushd extempore
Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side and yet thou rannst away
what instinct hadst thou for it

BARD
My lord do you see these meteors do you behold these
exhalations

Hot livers and cold purses

BARD
Choler my lord if rightly taken

since thou sawst thine own knee


FAL
My own knee when I was about thy years Hal I was not an eagles
talon in the waist I could have crept into any aldermans thumbring
a plague of sighing and grief it blows a man up like a bladder
Theres villanous news abroad here was Sir John Bracy from your
father you must to the Court in the morning
That same mad fellow of the North Percy and he of Wales that gave
Amaimon the bastinado and swore the Devil his true liegeman upon the
cross of a Welsh hookwhat a plague call you him

POINTZ
O Glendower

FAL
Owen Owenthe same and his soninlaw Mortimer and old
Northumberland and that sprightly Scot of Scots Douglas that
runs o horseback up a hill perpendicular

PRINCE
He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow
flying

FAL
You have hit it

PRINCE
So did he never the sparrow

FAL
Well that rascal hath good metal in him he will not run

PRINCE

FAL
O horseback ye cuckoo but afoot he will not budge a foot

PRINCE
Yes Jack upon instinct

FAL
I grant ye upon instinct Well he is there too and one Mordake
and a thousand bluecaps more
Worcester is stolen away tonight thy fathers beard is turnd
white with the news you may buy land now as cheap as stinking
mackerel
But tell me Hal art not thou horrible afeard thou being
heirapparent could the world pick thee out three such enemies again
as that fiend Douglas that spirit Percy and that devil Glendower
art thou not horribly afraid doth not thy blood thrill at it

PRINCE
Not a whit ifaith I lack some of thy instinct

FAL
Well thou wilt be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to
thy father If thou love life practise an answer

PRINCE
Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the particulars
of my life

FAL
Shall I content this chair shall be my state this dagger my
sceptre and this cushion my crown

PRINCE
Thy state is taken for a jointstool thy golden sceptre for a
leaden dagger and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown

FAL
Well an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee now shalt
thou be moved
Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red that it may be
thought I have wept for I must speak in passion and I will do it
in King Cambyses vein

PRINCE
Well here is my leg

FAL
And here is my speechStand aside nobility

HOST
O Jesu this is excellent sport i faith

FAL
Weep not sweet Queen for trickling tears are vain

HOST
O the Father how he holds his countenance

FAL
For Gods sake lords convey my tristful Queen
For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes


HOST
O Jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever
I see

FAL
Peace good pintpot peace good ticklebrainHarry I do not
only marvel where thou spendest thy time but also how thou art
accompanied for though the camomile the more it is trodden on
the faster it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the sooner
it wears That thou art my son I have partly thy mothers word
partly my own opinion but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye
and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me If
then thou be son to me here lies the point Why being son to me
art thou so pointed at
Shall the blessed Sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries
a question not to be askd Shall the son of England prove a thief
and take purses a question to be askd
There is a thing Harry which thou hast often heard of and it is
known to many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch as
ancient writers do report doth defile so doth the company thou
keepest for Harry now I do not speak to thee in drink but in
tears not in pleasure but in passion not in words only
but in woes also And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have
often noted in thy company but I know not his name

PRINCE
What manner of man an it like your Majesty

FAL
A goodly portly man ifaith and a corpulent of a cheerful look
a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage and as I think his age
some fifty or byr Lady inclining to threescore and now I
remember me his name is Falstaff if that man should be lewdly given
he deceiveth me for Harry I see virtue in his looks
If then the tree may be known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree
then peremptorily I speak it there is virtue in that Falstaff him
keep with the rest banish And tell me now thou naughty varlet tell
me where hast thou been this month

PRINCE
Dost thou speak like a king Do thou stand for me and Ill play
my father

FAL
Depose me if thou dost it half so gravely so majestically both
in word and matter hang me up by the heels for a rabbitsucker or a
poulters hare

PRINCE
Well here I am set

FAL
And here I standJudge my masters

PRINCE
Now Harry whence come you

FAL
My noble lord from Eastcheap

PRINCE
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous

FAL
Sblood my lord they are falseNay Ill tickle ye for a
young prince ifaith

PRINCE
Swearest thou ungracious boy henceforth neer look on me Thou art
violently carried away from grace there is a devil haunts thee in
the likeness of an old fat mana tun of man is thy companion Why
dost thou converse with that trunk of humours that boltinghutch of
beastliness that swollen parcel of dropsies that huge bombard of
sack that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly that
reverend Vice that grey Iniquity that father ruffian that vanity
in years Wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink it wherein
neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it wherein cunning but
in craft wherein crafty but in villany wherein villainous but in
all things wherein worthy but in nothing

FAL
I would your Grace would take me with you whom means your Grace

PRINCE
That villainous abominable misleader of youth Falstaff that old
whitebearded Satan

FAL
My lord the man I know

PRINCE
I know thou dost

FAL
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more
than I know That he is oldthe more the pityhis white hairs do
witness it If sack and sugar be a fault God help the wicked if to
be old and merry be a sin then many an old host that I know is damnd
if to be fat be to be hated then Pharaohs lean kine are to be loved
No my good lord banish Peto banish Bardolph banish Pointz but
for sweet Jack Falstaff kind Jack Falstaff true Jack Falstaff
valiant Jack Falstaff and therefore more valiant being as he is old
Jack Falstaff banish not him thy Harrys company banish not him thy
Harrys company banish plump Jack and banish all the world

bringing up I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as

ACT III

Scene I Bangor A Room in the Archdeacons House

Enter Hotspur Worcester Mortimer and Glendower

MORT
These promises are fair the parties sure
And our induction full of prosperous hope

HOT
Lord Mortimerand cousin GlendowerWill you sit down
And uncle WorcesterA plague upon it I have forgot the map

GLEND
No here it is
Sit cousin Percy sit good cousin Hotspur
For by that name as oft as Lancaster
Doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with
A rising sigh he wisheth you in Heaven

HOT
And you in Hell as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of

GLEND
I cannot blame him at my nativity
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
Of burning cressets ay and at my birth
The frame and huge foundation of the Earth
Shaked like a coward

HOT
Why so it would have done at the same season if your mothers
cat had but kittend though yourself had never been born

GLEND
I say the Earth did shake when I was born

HOT
And I say the Earth was not of my mind if you suppose as
fearing you it shook

GLEND
The Heavens were all on fire the Earth did tremble

HOT
O then th Earth shook to see the Heavens on fire
And not in fear of your nativity
Diseased Nature oftentimes breaks forth
In strange eruptions oft the teeming Earth
Is with a kind of colic pinchd and vexd
By the imprisoning of unruly wind
Within her womb which for enlargement striving
Shakes the old beldam Earth and topples down
Steeples and mossgrown towers At your birth
Our grandam Earth having this distemperature
In passion shook

GLEND
Cousin of many men
I do not bear these crossings Give me leave
To tell you once again that at my birth
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
The goats ran from the mountains and the herds
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
These signs have markd me extraordinary
And all the courses of my life do show
I am not in the roll of common men
Where is he livingclippd in with the sea
That chides the banks of England Scotland Wales
Which calls me pupil or hath read to me
And bring him out that is but womans son
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
And hold me pace in deep experiments

HOT
I think there is no man speaks better WelshIll to dinner

MORT
Peace cousin Percy you will make him mad

GLEND
I can call spirits from the vasty deep


HOT
Why so can I or so can any man
But will they come when you do call for them

GLEND
Why I can teach you cousin to command the Devil

HOT
And I can teach thee coz to shame the Devil
By telling truth tell truth and shame the Devil
If thou have power to raise him bring him hither
And Ill be sworn Ive power to shame him hence
O while you live tell truth and shame the Devil

MORT
Come come no more of this unprofitable chat

GLEND
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
Against my power thrice from the banks of Wye
And sandybottomd Severn have I sent
Him bootless home and weatherbeaten back

HOT
Home without boots and in foul weather too
How scaped he agues in the Devils name

GLEND
Come heres the map shall we divide our right
According to our threefold order taen

MORT
Th archdeacon hath divided it
Into three limits very equally
England from Trent and Severn hitherto
By south and east is to my part assignd
All westward Wales beyond the Severn shore
And all the fertile land within that bound
To Owen Glendowerand dear coz to you
The remnant northward lying off from Trent
And our indentures tripartite are drawn
Which being sealed interchangeably
A business that this night may execute
Tomorrow cousin Percy you and I
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
To meet your father and the Scottish power
As is appointed us at Shrewsbury
My father Glendower is not ready yet
Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days
To Glend Within that space you may have drawn together
Your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen

GLEND
A shorter time shall send me to you lords
And in my conduct shall your ladies come
From whom you now must steal and take no leave
For there will be a world of water shed
Upon the parting of your wives and you

HOT
Methinks my moiety north from Burton here
In quantity equals not one of yours
See how this river comes me cranking in
And cuts me from the best of all my land
A huge halfmoon a monstrous cantle out
Ill have the current in this place damnd up
And here the smug and sliver Trent shall run
In a new channel fair and evenly
It shall not wind with such a deep indent
To rob me of so rich a bottom here

GLEND
Not wind it shall it must you see it doth

MORT
Yea but
Mark how he bears his course and runs me up
With like advantage on the other side
Gelding th opposed continent as much
As on the other side it takes from you

WOR
Yea but a little charge will trench him here
And on this north side win this cape of land
And then he runneth straight and evenly

HOT
Ill have it so a little charge will do it

GLEND
I will not have it alterd

HOT
Will not you

GLEND
No nor you shall not

HOT
Who shall say me nay

GLEND
Why that will I

HOT
Let me not understand you then speak it in Welsh

GLEND
I can speak English lord as well as you
For I was traind up in the English Court
Where being but young I framed to the harp
Many an English ditty lovely well
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament
A virtue that was never seen in you

HOT
Marry and I am glad of it with all my heart
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
Than one of these same metre balletmongers
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turnd
Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge
Nothing so much as mincing poetry
Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag

GLEND
Come you shall have Trent turnd

HOT
I do not care Ill give thrice so much land
To any welldeserving friend
But in the way of bargain mark ye me
Ill cavil on the ninth part of a hair
Are the indentures drawn shall we be gone
GLEND

The Moon shines fair you may away by night
Ill in and haste the writer and withal
Break with your wives of your departure hence
I am afraid my daughter will run mad
So much she doteth on her Mortimer

Exit

MORT
Fie cousin Percy how you cross my father

HOT
I cannot choose sometimes he angers me
With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies
And of a dragon and a finless fish
A clipwingd griffin and a moulten raven
A couching lion and a ramping cat
And such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff
As puts me from my faith I tell you what
He held me last night at the least nine hours
In reckoning up the several devils names
That were his lacqueys I cried hum and well
But markd him not a word O hes as tedious
As a tired horse a railing wife
Worse than a smoky house I had rather live
With cheese and garlic in a windmill far
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
In any summerhouse in Christendom

MORT
In faith he is a worthy gentleman
Exceedingly wellread and profited
In strange concealments valiant as a lion
And wondrous affable and as bountiful
As mines of India Shall I tell you cousin
He holds your temper in a high respect
And curbs himself even of his natural scope
When you do cross his humour faith he does
I warrant you that man is not alive
Might so have tempted him as you have done
Without the taste of danger and reproof
But do not use it oft let me entreat you


WOR
In faith my lord you are too wilfulblunt
And since your coming hither have done enough
To put him quite beside his patience
You must needs learn lord to amend this fault
Though sometimes it show greatness courage blood
And thats the dearest grace it renders you
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
Defect of manners want of government
Pride haughtiness opinion and disdain
The least of which haunting a nobleman
Loseth mens hearts and leaves behind a stain
Upon the beauty of all parts besides
Beguiling them of commendation

HOT
Well I am schoold good manners be your speed
Here come our wives and let us take our leave

Reenter Glendower with Lady Mortimer and Lady Percy

MORT
This is the deadly spite that angers me
My wife can speak no English I no Welsh

GLEND
My daughter weeps she will not part with you
Shell be a soldier too shell to the wars

MORT
Good father tell her that she and my aunt Percy
Shall follow in your conduct speedily

Glendower speaks to Lady Mortimer in Welsh and she answers
him in the same

GLEND
Shes desperate here a peevish selfwilld harlotry
One that no persuasion can do good upon

Lady Mortimer speaks to Mortimer in Welsh

MORT
I understand thy looks that pretty Welsh
Which thou pourst down from these swelling heavens
I am too perfect in and but for shame
In such a parley should I answer thee

Lady Mortimer speaks to him again in Welsh

I understand thy kisses and thou mine
And thats a feeling disputation
But I will never be a truant love
Till I have learnd thy language for thy tongue
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly pennd
Sung by a fair queen in a Summers bower
With ravishing division to her lute

GLEND
Nay if you melt then will she run mad

Lady Mortimer speaks to Mortimer again in Welsh

MORT
O I am ignorance itself in this

GLEND
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
And rest your gentle head upon her lap
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
Making such difference betwixt wake and sleep
As is the difference betwixt day and night
The hour before the heavenlyharnessd team
Begins his golden progress in the East

MORT
With all my heart Ill sit and hear her sing
By that time will our book I think be drawn

GLEND
Do so
An those musicians that shall play to you
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
And straight they shall be here sit and attend

HOT
Come Kate thou art perfect in lying down come quick
quick that I may lay my head in thy lap

LADY P
Go ye giddy goose

The music plays

HOT
Now I perceive the Devil understands Welsh
And tis no marvel hes so humorous
Byr Lady hes a good musician

LADY P
Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
altogether governed by humours Lie still ye thief and hear
the lady sing in Welsh

HOT
I had rather hear Lady my brach howl in Irish

LADY P
Wouldst thou have thy head broken

HOT
No

LADY P
Then be still

HOT
Neither tis a womans fault

LADY P
Now God help thee

HOT
Peace she sings

A Welsh song by Lady Mortimer

Come Kate Ill have your song too

LADY P
Not mine in good sooth


HOT
Not yours in good sooth Heart you swear like a
comfitmakers wife Not mine in good sooth and As true
as I live and As God shall mend me and As sure as day
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
As if thou neer walkdst further than Finsbury
Swear me Kate like a lady as thou art
A good mouthfilling oath and leave in sooth
And such protest of peppergingerbread
To velvetguards and Sundaycitizens Come sing

LADY P
I will not sing

HOT
Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreastteacher
An the indentures be drawn Ill away within these two hours
and so come in when ye will

Exit

GLEND
Come come Lord Mortimer you are as slow
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go
By this our books drawn well but seal and then
To horse immediately

MORT
With all my heart

Exeunt



Scene II London A Room in the Palace

Enter King Henry Prince Henry and Lords

KING
Lords give us leave the Prince of Wales and I
Must have some private conference but be near at hand
For we shall presently have need of you

Exeunt Lords


I know not whether God will have it so
For some displeasing service I have done
That in His secret doom out of my blood
Hell breed revengement and a scourge for me
But thou dost in thy passages of life
Make me believe that thou art only markd
For the hot vengeance and the rod of Heaven
To punish my mistreadings Tell me else
Could such inordinate and low desires
Such poor such base such lewd such mean attempts
Such barren pleasures rude society
As thou art matchd withal and grafted to
Accompany the greatness of thy blood
And hold their level with thy princely heart

PRINCE
So please your Majesty I would I could
Quit all offences with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal
Yet such extenuation let me beg
As in reproof of many tales devised
By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers
Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
I may for some things true wherein my youth
Hath faulty wanderd and irregular
Find pardon on my true submission

KING
God pardon thee Yet let me wonder Harry
At thy affections which do hold a wing
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost
Which by thy younger brother is supplied
And art almost an alien to the hearts
Of all the Court and princes of my blood
The hope and expectation of thy time
Is ruind and the soul of every man
Prophetically does forethink thy fall
Had I so lavish of my presence been
So commonhackneyd in the eyes of men
So stale and cheap to vulgar company
Opinion that did help me to the crown
Had still kept loyal to possession
And left me in reputeless banishment

A fellow of no mark nor likelihood
By being seldom seen I could not stir
But like a comet I was wonderd at
That men would tell their children This is he
Others would say Where which is Bolingbroke
And then I stole all courtesy from Heaven
And dressd myself in such humility
That I did pluck allegiance from mens hearts
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
Even in the presence of the crowned King
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new
My presence like a robe pontifical
Neer seen but wonderd at and so my state
Seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast
And won by rareness such solemnity
The skipping King he ambled up and down
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
Soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
Mingled his royalty with capering fools
Had his great name profaned with their scorns
And gave his countenance against his name
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
Of every beardless vain comparative
Grew a companion to the common streets
Enfeoffd himself to popularity
That being dally swallowd by mens eyes
They surfeited with honey and began
To loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
More than a little is by much too much
So when he had occasion to be seen
He was but as the cuckoo is in June
Heard not regarded seen but with such eyes
As sick and blunted with community
Afford no extraordinary gaze
Such as is bent on sunlike majesty
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes
But rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down
Slept in his face and renderd such aspect
As cloudy men use to their adversaries
Being with his presence glutted gorged and full
And in that very line Harry standst thou
For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
With vile participation not an eye
But is aweary of thy common sight
Save mine which hath desired to see thee more
Which now doth that I would not have it do
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness

PRINCE
I shall hereafter my thricegracious lord
Be more myself

KING
For all the world
As thou art to this hour was Richard then
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurg
And even as I was then is Percy now
Now by my sceptre and my soul to boot
He hath more worthy interest to the state
Than thou the shadow of succession
For of no right nor colour like to right
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm
Turns head against the lions armed jaws
And being no more in debt to years than thou
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
To bloody battles and to bruising arms
What neverdying honour hath he got
Against renowned Douglas whose high deeds
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
Holds from all soldiers chief majority
And military title capital
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ
Thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swathingclothes
This infant warrior in his enterprises
Discomfited great Douglas taen him once
Enlarged him and made a friend of him
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
And shake the peace and safety of our throne
And what say you to this Percy Northumberland
Th Archbishops Grace of York Douglas and Mortimer
Capitulate against us and are up
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee
Why Harry do I tell thee of my foes
Which art my nearst and dearest enemy
Thou that art like enoughthrough vassal fear
Base inclination and the start of spleen
To fight against me under Percys pay
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
To show how much thou art degenerate

PRINCE
Do not think so you shall not find it so
And God forgive them that so much have swayd
Your Majestys good thoughts away from me
I will redeem all this on Percys head
And in the closing of some glorious day
Be bold to tell you that I am your son
When I will wear a garment all of blood
And stain my favour in a bloody mask
Which washd away shall scour my shame with it
And that shall be the day wheneer it lights
That this same child of honour and renown
This gallant Hotspur this allpraised knight
And your unthoughtof Harry chance to meet
For every honour sitting on his helm
Would they were multitudes and on my head
My shames redoubled for the time will come
That I shall make this northern youth exchange
His glorious deeds for my indignities
Percy is but my factor good my lord
T engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
And I will call hall to so strict account
That he shall render every glory up
Yea even the slightest worship of his time
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart
This in the name of God I promise here
The which if I perform and do survive
I do beseech your Majesty may salve
The longgrown wounds of my intemperance
If not the end of life cancels all bands
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow

KING
A hundred thousand rebels die in this
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein

Enter Sir Walter Blunt

How now good Blunt thy looks are full of speed

BLUNT
So is the business that I come to speak of
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
That Douglas and the English rebels met

Th eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
A mighty and a fearful head they are
If promises be kept on every hand
As ever offerd foul play in a State

KING
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth today
With him my son Lord John of Lancaster
For this advertisement is five days old
On Wednesday next you Harry shall set forward
On Thursday we ourselves will march
Our meeting is Bridgenorth and Harry you
Shall march through Glostershire by which account
Our business valued some twelve days hence
Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet
Our hands are full of business lets away
Advantage feeds him fat while men delay

ACT IV

Scene I The Rebel Camp near Shrewsbury

Enter Hotspur Worcester and Douglas

HOT
Well said my noble Scot if speaking truth
In this fine age were not thought flattery
Such attribution should the Douglas have
As not a soldier of this seasons stamp
Should go so generalcurrent through the world
By God I cannot flatter I defy
The tongues of soothers but a braver place
In my hearts love hath no man than yourself
Nay task me to my word approve me lord

DOUG
Thou art the king of honour
No man so potent breathes upon the ground
But I will beard him

HOT
Do so and tis well

Enter a Messenger with letters

What letters hast thou thereI can but thank you

MESS
These letters come from your father

HOT
Letters from him why comes he not himself

MESS
He cannot come my lord hes grievous sick

HOT
Zwounds how has he the leisure to be sick
In such a justling time Who leads his power
Under whose government come they along

MESS
His letters bears his mind not I my lord

WOR
I prythee tell me doth he keep his bed

MESS
He did my lord four days ere I set forth
And at the time of my departure thence
He was much feard by his physicians

WOR
I would the state of time had first been whole
Ere he by sickness had been visited
His health was never better worth than now

HOT
Sick now droop now this sickness doth infect
The very lifeblood of our enterprise
Tis catching hither even to our camp

He writes me here that inward sickness
And that his friends by deputation could not
So soon be drawn no did he think it meet
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
On any soul removed but on his own
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement
That with our small conjunction we should on
To see how fortune is disposed to us
For as he writes there is no quailing now
Because the King is certainly possessd
Of all our purposes What say you to it

WOR
Your fathers sickness is a maim to us

HOT
A perilous gash a very limb loppd off
And yet in faith tis not his present want
Seems more than we shall find it Were it good
To set the exact wealth of all our states
All at one cast to set so rich a main
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
It were not good for therein should we read
The very bottom and the soul of hope
The very list the very utmost bound
Of all our fortunes

DOUG
Faith and so we should
Where now remains a sweet reversion
And we may boldly spend upon the hope
Of what is to come in
A comfort of retirement lives in this

HOT
A rendezvous a home to fly unto
If that the Devil and mischance look big
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs

WOR
But yet I would your father had been here
The quality and hair of our attempt
Brooks no division it will be thought
By some that know not why he is away
That wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence
And think how such an apprehension
May turn the tide of fearful faction
And breed a kind of question in our cause
For well you know we of the offering side
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
And stop all sightholes every loop from whence
The eye of reason may pry in upon us
This absence of your fathers draws a curtain
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
Before not dreamt of

HOT
Nay you strain too far
I rather of his absence make this use
It lends a lustre and more great opinion
A larger dare to our great enterprise
Than if the earl were here for men must think
If we without his help can make a head
To push against the kingdom with his help
We shall oerturn it topsyturvy down
Yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole

DOUG
As heart can think there is not such a word
Spoke in Scotland as this term of fear

Enter Sir Richard Vernon

HOT
My cousin Vernon welcome by my soul

VER
Pray God my news be worth a welcome lord
The Earl of Westmoreland seven thousand strong
Is marching hitherwards with him Prince John

HOT
No harm what more

VER
And further I have learnd
The King himself in person is set forth
Or hitherwards intended speedily
With strong and mighty preparation

HOT
He shall be welcome too Where is his son
The nimblefooted madcap Prince of Wales
And his comrades that daff the world aside
And bid it pass

VER
All furnishd all in arms
All plumed like estridges that with the wind
Bate it like eagles having lately bathed
Glittering in golden coats like images
As full of spirit as the month of May
And gorgeous as the Sun at midsummer
Wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls
I saw young Harrywith his beaver on
His cuisses on his thighs gallantly armd
Rise from the ground like featherd Mercury
And vault it with such ease into his seat
As if an angel droppd down from the clouds
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
And witch the world with noble horsemanship

HOT
No more no more worse than the Sun in March
This praise doth nourish agues Let them come
They come like sacrifices in their trim
And to the fireeyed maid of smoky war
All hot and bleeding will we offer them
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
Up to the ears in blood I am on fire
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
And yet not oursCome let me taste my horse
Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales
Harry and Harry shall hot horse to horse
Meet and neer part till one drop down a corse
O that Glendower were come

VER
There is more news
I learnd in Worcester as I rode along
He cannot draw his power this fourteen days

DOUG
Thats the worst tidings that I hear of yet

WOR
Ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound

HOT
What may the Kings whole battle reach unto

VER
To thirty thousand

HOT
Forty let it be
My father and Glendower being both away
The powers of us may serve so great a day
Come let us take a muster speedily
Doomsday is near die all die merrily

DOUG
Talk not of dying I am out of fear
Of death or deaths hand for this one halfyear

Exeunt

FAL
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers I am a soused gurnet I have
misused the Kings press damnably I have got in exchange of
a hundred and fifty soldiers three hundred and odd pounds I
pressd me none but good householders yeomens sons inquired
me out contracted bachelors such as had been askd twice on the
banns such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lief hear the
Devil as a drum such as fear the report of a caliver worse than
a struck fowl or a hurt wildduck I pressd me none but such
toastsandbutter with hearts in their bodies no bigger than
pinsheads and they have bought out their services and now
my whole charge consists of ancients corporals lieutenants
gentlemen of companies slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
painted cloth where the gluttons dogs licked his sores and
such as indeed were never soldiers but discarded unjust
servingmen younger sons to younger brothers revolted tapsters
and ostlers tradefallen the cankers of a calm world and a long
peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced
ancient and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have
bought out their services that you would think that I had a
hundred and fifty tattered Prodigals lately come from
swinekeeping from eating draff and husks A mad fellow met me on
the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressd
the dead bodies
No eye hath seen such scarecrows Ill not march through Coventry
with them thats flat nay and the villains march wide betwixt
the legs as if they had gyves on for indeed I had the most of
them out of prison Theres but a shirt and a half in all my company
and the halfshirt is two napkins tackd together and thrown over the
shoulders like a heralds coat without sleeves and the shirt to say
the truth stolen from my host at Saint Albans or the rednose
innkeeper of Daventry
But thats all one theyll find linen enough on every hedge

Enter Prince Henry and Westmoreland

PRINCE
How now blown Jack how now quilt

FAL
What Hal how now mad wag what a devil dost thou in
WarwickshireMy good Lord of Westmoreland I cry you mercy

HOT
Why say you so looks he not for supply

VER
So do we

HOT
His is certain ours is doubtful

WOR
Good cousin be advised stir not tonight

Do not my lord

DOUG
You do not counsel well
You speak it out of fear and cold heart

VER
Do me no slander Douglas by my life
And I dare well maintain it with my life
If wellrespected honour bid me on
I hold as little counsel with weak fear
As you my lord or any Scot that this day lives
Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle
Which of us fears

DOUG
Yea or tonight

VER
Content

HOT
Tonight say I

VER
Come come it may not be I wonder much
Being men of such great leading as you are
That you foresee not what impediments
Drag back our expedition certain Horse
Of my cousin Vernons are not yet come up
Your uncle Worcesters Horse came but today
And now their pride and mettle is asleep
Their courage with hard labour tame and dull
That not a horse is half the half himself

HOT
So are the horses of the enemy
In general journeybated and brought low
The better part of ours are full of rest

WOR
The number of the King exceedeth ours
For Gods sake cousin stay till all come in

The Trumpet sounds a parley

Enter Sir Walter Blunt

BLUNT
I come with gracious offers from the King
If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect

HOT
Welcome Sir Walter Blunt and would to God
You were of our determination
Some of us love you well and even those some
Envy your great deservings and good name
Because you are not of our quality
But stand against us like an enemy

BLUNT
And God defend but still I should stand so
So long as out of limit and true rule
You stand against anointed majesty
But to my charge the King hath sent to know
The nature of your griefs and whereupon
You conjure from the breast of civil peace
Such bold hostility teaching his duteous land
Audacious cruelty If that the King
Have any way your good deserts forgot
Which he confesseth to be manifold
He bids you name your griefs and with all speed
You shall have your desires with interest
And pardon absolute for yourself and these
Herein misled by your suggestion

HOT
The King is kind and well we know the King
Knows at what time to promise when to pay
My father and my uncle and myself
Did give him that same royalty he wears
Andwhen he was not sixandtwenty strong
Sick in the worlds regard wretched and low
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
My father gave him welcome to the shore
Andwhen he heard him swear and vow to God
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster
To sue his livery and beg his peace
With tears of innocence and terms of zeal
My father in kind heart and pity moved
Swore him assistance and performed it too
Now when the lords and barons of the realm
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him
The more and less came in with cap and knee
Met him in boroughs cities villages
Attended him on bridges stood in lanes
Laid gifts before him profferd him their oaths
Give him their heirs as pages followd him
Even at the heels in golden multitudes
He presentlyas greatness knows itself
Steps me a little higher than his vow
Made to my father while his blood was poor
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurg
And now forsooth takes on him to reform
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth
Cries out upon abuses seems to weep
Over his countrys wrongs and by this face
This seeming brow of justice did he win
The hearts of all that he did angle for
Proceeded further cut me off the heads
Of all the favourites that the absent King
In deputation left behind him here
When he was personal in the Irish war

BLUNT
Tut I came not to hear this

HOT
Then to the point
In short time after he deposed the King
Soon after that deprived him of his life
And in the neck of that taskd the whole State
To make that worse sufferd his kinsman March
Who is if every owner were well placed
Indeed his king to be engaged in Wales
There without ransom to lie forfeited
Disgraced me in my happy victories
Sought to entrap me by intelligence
Rated my uncle from the Councilboard
In rage dismissd my father from the Court
Broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
And in conclusion drove us to seek out
This head of safety and withal to pry
Into his title the which now we find
Too indirect for long continuance


BLUNT
Shall I return this answer to the King

HOT
Not so Sir Walter well withdraw awhile
Go to the King and let there be impawnd
Some surety for a safe return again
And in the morning early shall my uncle
Bring him our purposes and so farewell

BLUNT
I would you would accept of grace and love

HOT
And may be so we shall

BLUNT
Pray God you do

Exeunt



Scene IV York A Room in the Archbishops Palace

Enter the Archbishop of York and Sir Michael

ARCH
Hie good Sir Michael bear this sealed brief
With winged haste to the Lord Marshal
This to my cousin Scroop and all the rest
To whom they are directed If you knew
How much they do import you would make haste

SIR M
My good lord
I guess their tenour

ARCH
Like enough you do
Tomorrow good Sir Michael is a day
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
Must bide the touch for sir at Shrewsbury
As I am truly given to understand
The King with mighty and quickraised power
Meets with Lord Harry and I fear Sir Michael
What with the sickness of Northumberland
Whose power was in the first proportion
And what with Owen Glendowers absence thence
Who with them was a rated sinew too
And comes not in oerruld by prophecies
I fear the power of Percy is too weak
To wage an instant trial with the King

SIR M
Why my good lord you need not fear
Theres Douglas and Lord Mortimer

ARCH
No Mortimers not there

SIR M
But there is Mordake Vernon Lord Harry Percy
And theres my Lord of Worcester and a head
Of gallant warriors noble gentlemen

ARCH
And so there is but yet the King hath drawn
The special head of all the land together
The Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster
The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt
And many more corrivals and dear men
Of estimation and command in arms

SIR M
Doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed

ARCH
I hope no less yet needful tis to fear
And to prevent the worst Sir Michael speed
For if Lord Percy thrive not ere the King
Dismiss his power he means to visit us
For he hath heard of our confederacy
And tis but wisdom to make strong against him
Therefore make haste I must go write again
To other friends and so farewell Sir Michael

Exeunt




ACT V

Scene I The Kings Camp near Shrewsbury

Enter King Henry Prince Henry Lancaster Sir Walter Blunt
and Sir John Falstaff

KING
How bloodily the Sun begins to peer
Above yon busky hill the day looks pale
At his distemperature

PRINCE
The southern wind
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
Foretells a tempest and a blustering day

KING
Then with the losers let it sympathize
For nothing can seem foul to those that win

The trumpet sounds Enter Worcester and Vernon

How now my Lord of Worcester tis not well
That you and I should meet upon such terms
As now we meet You have deceived our trust
And made us doff our easy robes of peace
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
This is not well my lord this is not well
What say you tot will you again unknit
This churlish knot of allabhorred war
And move in that obedient orb again
Where you did give a fair and natural light
And be no more an exhaled meteor
A prodigy of fear and a portent
Of broached mischief to the unborn times

WOR
Hear me my liege
For mine own part I could be well content
To entertain the lagend of my life
With quiet hours for I do protest
I have not sought the day of this dislike

KING
You have not sought it why how comes it then

FAL
Rebellion lay in his way and he found it

PRINCE
Peace chewet peace

WOR
It pleased your Majesty to turn your looks
Of favour from myself and all our House
And yet I must remember you my lord
We were the first and dearest of your friends
For you my staff of office did I break
In Richards time and posted day and night
To meet you on the way and kiss your hand
When yet you were in place and in account
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I
It was myself my brother and his son
That brought you home and boldly did outdare
The dangers of the time You swore to us
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster
That you did nothing purpose gainst the state
Nor claim no further than your newfalln right
The seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster
To this we swore our aid But in short space
It raind down fortune showering on your head
And such a flood of greatness fell on you
What with our help what with the absent King
What with the injuries of a wanton time
The seeming sufferances that you had borne
And the contrarious winds that held the King
So long in his unlucky Irish wars
That all in England did repute him dead
And from this swarm of fair advantages
You took occasion to be quickly wood
To gripe the general sway into your hand
Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster
And being fed by us you used us so
As that ungentle gull the cuckoobird
Useth the sparrow did oppress our nest
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
That even our love thirst not come near your sight
For fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
We were enforced for safetysake to fly
Out of your sight and raise this present head
Whereby we stand opposed by such means
As you yourself have forged against yourself
By unkind usage dangerous countenance
And violation of all faith and troth
Sworn to tis in your younger enterprise

KING
These things indeed you have articulate
Proclaimd at marketcrosses read in churches
To face the garment of rebellion
With some fine colour that may please the eye
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
Of hurlyburly innovation
And never yet did insurrection want
Such watercolours to impaint his cause
Nor moody beggars starving for a time
Of pellmell havoc and confusion

PRINCE
In both our armies there is many a soul
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter
If once they join in trial Tell your nephew
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
In praise of Henry Percy by my hopes
This present enterprise set off his head
I do not think a braver gentleman
More activevaliant or more valiantyoung
More daring or more bold is now alive
To grace this latter age with noble deeds
For my partI may speak it to my shame
I have a truant been to chivalry
And so I hear he doth account me too
Yet this before my fathers Majesty
I am content that he shall take the odds
Of his great name and estimation
And will to save the blood on either side
Try fortune with him in a single fight

KING
And Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee
Albeit considerations infinite
Do make against itNo good Worcester no
We love our people well even those we love
That are misled upon your cousins part
And will they take the offer of our grace
Both he and they and you yea every man
Shall be my friend again and Ill be his
So tell your cousin and then bring me word
What he will do but if he will not yield
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
And they shall do their office So be gone
We will not now be troubled with reply
We offer fair take it advisedly

Exit Worcester with Vernon

PRINCE
It will not be accepted on my life
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
Are confident against the world in arms

KING
Hence therefore every leader to his charge
For on their answer will we set on them
And God befriend us as our cause is just

Exeunt the King Blunt and Prince John

FAL
Hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me
so tis a point of friendship

PRINCE
Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship
Say thy prayers and farewell

FAL
I would it were bedtime Hal and all well

PRINCE
Why thou owest God a death

Exit

FAL
Tis not due yet I would be loth to pay Him before His day
What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me
Well tis no matter honour pricks me on Yea but how if honour
prick me off when I come on how then Can honor setto a leg
no or an arm no or take away the grief of a wound no Honour
hath no skill in surgery then no What is honour a word What
is that word honour air A trim reckoningWho hath it he that
died o Wednesday Doth he feel it no Doth be hear it no Is it
insensible then yea to the dead But will it not live with the
living no Why detraction will not suffer it Therefore Ill none
of it honour is a mere scutcheonand so ends my catechism

Scene II The Rebel Camp

Enter Worcester and Vernon

WOR
O no my nephew must not know Sir Richard
The liberalkind offer of the King

VER
Twere best he did

WOR
Then are we all undone
It is not possible it cannot be
The King should keep his word in loving us
He will suspect us still and find a time
To punish this offence in other faults
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
For treason is but trusted like the fox
Who neer so tame so cherishd and lockd up
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors
Look how we can or sad or merrily
Interpretation will misquote our looks
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall
The better cherishd still the nearer death
My nephews trespass may be well forgot
It hath th excuse of youth and heat of blood
And an adopted name of privilege
A harebraind Hotspur governd by a spleen
All his offences live upon my head
And on his fathers we did train him on
And his corruption being taen from us
We as the spring of all shall pay for all
Therefore good cousin let not Harry know
In any case the offer of the King

VER
Deliver what you will Ill say tis so
Here comes your cousin

Enter Hotspur and Douglas Officers and Soldiers behind

HOT
My uncle is returnd deliver up
My Lord of WestmorelandUncle what news

WOR
The King will bid you battle presently

DOUG
Defy him by the Lord Of Westmoreland

HOT
Lord Douglas go you and tell him so

DOUG
Marry I shall and very willingly

Exit

WOR
There is no seeming mercy in the King

HOT
Did you beg any God forbid

WOR
I told him gently of our grievances
Of his oathbreaking which he mended thus
By newforswearing that he is forsworn
He calls us rebels traitors and will scourge
With haughty arms this hateful name in us

Reenter Douglas

DOUG
Arm gentlemen to arms for I have thrown
A brave defiance in King Henrys teeth
And Westmoreland that was engaged did bear it
Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on

WOR
The Prince of Wales steppd forth before the King
And nephew challenged you to single fight

HOT
O would the quarrel lay upon our heads
And that no man might draw short breath today
But I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell me
How showd his tasking seemd it in contempt

VER
No by my soul I never in my life
Did hear a challenge urged more modestly
Unless a brother should a brother dare
To gentle exercise and proof of arms
He gave you all the duties of a man
Trimmd up your praises with a princely tongue
Spoke your deservings like a chronicle
Making you ever better than his praise
By still dispraising praise valued with you
And which became him like a prince indeed
He made a blushing cital of himself
And chid his truant youth with such a grace
As if he masterd there a double spirit
Of teaching and of learning instantly
There did he pause but let me tell the world
If he outlive the envy of this day
England did never owe so sweet a hope
So much misconstrued in his wantonness

HOT
Cousin I think thou art enamoured
Upon his follies never did I hear
Of any prince so wild o liberty
But be he as he will yet once ere night
I will embrace him with a soldiers arm
That he shall shrink under my courtesy
Arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends
Better consider what you have to do
Than I that have not well the gift of tongue
Can lift your blood up with persuasion

Enter a Messenger

MESS
My lord here are letters for you

HOT
I cannot read them now
O gentlemen the time of life is short
To spend that shortness basely were too long
If life did ride upon a dials point
Still ending at th arrival of an hour
An if we live we live to tread on kings
If die brave death when princes die with us
Now for our consciences the arms are fair
When the intent of bearing them is just

Enter another Messenger

MESS
My lord prepare the King comes on apace

HOT
I thank him that he cuts me from my tale
For I profess not talking only this
Let each man do his best and here draw I
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
With the best blood that I can meet withal
In the adventure of this perilous day
Now Esperance Percy and set on
Sound all the lofty instruments of war
And by that music let us all embrace
For Heaven to Earth some of us never shall
A second time do such a courtesy

The trumpets sound They embrace and exeunt



Scene III Plain between the Camps

Excursions and Parties fighting Alarum to the battle
Then enter Douglas and Sir Walter Blunt meeting

BLUNT
What is thy name that in the battle thus
Thou crossest me what honour dost thou seek
Upon my head

DOUG
Know then my name is Douglas
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
Because some tell me that thou art a king

BLUNT
They tell thee true

DOUG
The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought
Thy likeness for instead of thee King Harry
This sword hath ended him so shall it thee
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner

BLUNT

And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
Lord Staffords death

They fight and Blunt is slain Enter Hotspur

O Douglas hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus
I never had triumphed oer a Scot

DOUG
Alls done alls won here breathless lies the King

HOT

HOT
This Douglas no I know this face full well
A gallant knight he was his name was Blunt
Semblably furnishd like the King himself

DOUG
A fool go with thy soul wherere it goes
A borrowd title hast thou bought too dear
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king

HOT
The King hath many marching in his coats

DOUG
Now by my sword I will kill all his coats
Ill murder all his wardrobe piece by piece
Until I meet the King

HOT
Up and away
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day

PRINCE

Lest your retirement do amaze your friends

KING
I will do so
My Lord of Westmoreland lead him to his tent

WEST
Come my lord Ill lead you to your tent

PRINCE
Lead me my lord I do not need your help
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this
Where staind nobility lies trodden on
And rebels arms triumph in massacres

LAN
We breathe too longcome cousin Westmoreland
Our duty this way lies for Gods sake come

Exeunt Lancaster and Westmoreland

PRINCE
By Heaven thou hast deceived me Lancaster
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit
Before I loved thee as a brother John
But now I do respect thee as my soul

KING
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
With lustier maintenance than I did look for
Of such an ungrown warrior

PRINCE
O this boy
Lends mettle to us all

Exit

Alarums Enter Douglas

DOUG
Another king they grow like Hydras heads
I am the Douglas fatal to all those

That wear those colours on themWhat art thou
That counterfeitst the person of a king

KING
The King himself who Douglas grieves at heart
So many of his shadows thou hast met
And not the very King I have two boys
Seek Percy and thyself about the field
But seeing thou fallst on me so luckily
I will assay thee so defend thyself

DOUG
I fear thou art another counterfeit
And yet in faith thou bearst thee like a king
But mine Im sure thou art whoeer thou be
And thus I win thee

They fight the King being in danger reenter Prince Henry

PRINCE
Hold up thy head vile Scot or thou art like
Never to hold it up again the spirits
Of valiant Shirley Stafford Blunt are in my arms
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee
Who never promiseth but he means to pay

They fight Douglas flies

Cheerly my lord how fares your Grace
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent
And so hath Clifton Ill to Clifton straight

KING
Stay and breathe awhile
Thou hast redeemd thy lost opinion
And showd thou makest some tender of my life
In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me

PRINCE
O God they did me too much injury
That ever said I hearkend for your death
If it were so I might have let alone
Th insulting hand of Douglas over you
Which would have been as speedy in your end
As all the poisonous potions in the world
And saved the treacherous labour of your son

KING
Make up to Clifton Ill to Sir Nicholas Gawsey

Exit

Enter Hotspur

HOT
If I mistake not thou art Harry Monmouth

PRINCE
Thou speakst as if I would deny my name

HOT
My name is Harry Percy

PRINCE
Why then I see
A very valiant rebel of the name
I am the Prince of Wales and think not Percy
To share with me in glory any more
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere
Nor can one England brook a double reign
Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales

HOT
Nor shall it Harry for the hour is come
To end the one of us and would to God
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine

PRINCE
Ill make it greater ere I part from thee
And all the budding honours on thy crest
Ill crop to make a garland for my head

HOT
I can no longer brook thy vanities

They fight

Enter Falstaff

FAL
Well said Hal to it Hal Nay you shall find no boys
play here I can tell you

Reenter Douglas he fights with Falstaff who falls down as if
he were dead and exit Douglas Hotspure is wounded and falls

HOT
O Harry thou hast robbd me of my youth
I better brook the loss of brittle life
Than those proud titles thou hast won of me
They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh
But thoughts the slave of life and life Times fool
And Time that takes survey of all the world
Must have a stop O I could prophesy
But that the earthy and cold hand of death
Lies on my tongue no Percy thou art dust
And food for

Dies

PRINCE
For worms brave Percy fare thee well great heart
Illweaved ambition how much art thou shrunk
When that this body did contain a spirit
A kingdom for it was too small a bound
But now two paces of the vilest earth
Is room enough This earth that bears thee dead
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman
If thou wert sensible of courtesy
I should not make so dear a show of zeal
But let my favours hide thy mangled face
And even in thy behalf Ill thank myself
For doing these fair rites of tenderness
Adieu and take thy praise with thee to Heaven
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave
But not rememberd in thy epitaph

Sees Falstaff on the ground

What old acquaintance could not all this flesh
Keep in a little life Poor Jack farewell
I could have better spared a better man
O I should have a heavy miss of thee
If I were much in love with vanity
Death hath not struck so fat a deer today
Though many dearer in this bloody fray
Embowelld will I see thee byandby
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie

Exit

FAL
Rising Embowelld if thou embowel me today Ill give you leave
to powder me and eat me too tomorrow Sblood twas time to
counterfeit or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too
Counterfeit I lie I am no counterfeit to die is to be a
counterfeit for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the
life of a man but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth
is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image of life indeed
The better part of valour is discretion in the which better part I
have saved my life
Zwounds I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy though he be dead how
if he should counterfeit too and rise by my faith I am afraid he
would prove the better counterfeit Therefore Ill make him sure yea
and Ill swear I killd him Why may not he rise as well as I
Nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me Therefore
sirrah with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me

Takes Hotspur on his hack

Reenter Prince Henry and Lancaster

PRINCE
Come brother John full bravely hast thou fleshd
Thy maiden sword

LAN
But soft whom have we here
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead

PRINCE
I did I saw him dead breathless and bleeding
Upon the ground
Art thou alive or is it fantasy
That plays upon our eyesight I prythee speak
We will not trust our eyes without our ears
Thou art not what thou seemst

FAL
No thats certain I am not a double man but if I be not
Jack Falstaff then am I a Jack There is Percy Throwing the
body down if your father will do me any honour so if not let
him kill the next Percy himself I look to be either earl or
duke I can assure you

PRINCE
Why Percy I killd myself and saw thee dead

FAL
Didst thou Lord Lord how this world is given to lying
I grant you I was down and out of breath and so was he but
we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury
clock If I may be believed so if not let them that should
reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads Ill take it upon
my death I gave him this wound in the thigh if the man were
alive and would deny it zwounds I would make him eat a piece of
my sword

LAN
This is the strangest tale that ever I heard

PRINCE
This is the strangest fellow brother John
Come bring your luggage nobly on your back
For my part if a lie may do thee grace
Ill gild it with the happiest terms I have

A retreat is sounded

The trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours
Come brother lets to th highest of the field
To see what friends are living who are dead

Exeunt Prince Henry and Lancaster

FAL
Ill follow as they say for reward He that rewards me God
reward him If I do grow great Ill grow less for Ill purge
and leave sack and live cleanly as a nobleman should do

Exit bearing off the body



Scene V Another Part of the Field

The trumpets sound Enter King Henry Prince Henry
Lancaster Westmoreland and others with Worcester and
Vernon prisoners

KING
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke
Illspirited Worcester did not we send grace
Pardon and terms of love to all of you
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary
Misuse the tenour of thy kinsmans trust
Three knights upon our party slain today
A noble earl and many a creature else
Had been alive this hour
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
Betwixt our armies true intelligence

WOR
What I have done my safety urged me to
And I embrace this fortune patiently
Since not to be avoided it fails on me

KING
Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too
Other offenders we will pause upon

Exeunt Worcester and Vernon guarded

How goes the field

PRINCE
The noble Scot Lord Douglas when he saw
The fortune of the day quite turnd from him
The noble Percy slain and all his men
Upon the foot of fear fled with the rest
And falling from a hill he was so bruised
That the pursuers took him At my tent
The Douglas is and I beseech your Grace
I may dispose of him

KING
With all my heart

PRINCE
Then brother John of Lancaster to you
This honourable bounty shall belong
Go to the Douglas and deliver him
Up to his pleasure ransomless and free
His valour shown upon our crests today
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
Even in the bosom of our adversaries

KING
Then this remains that we divide our power
You son John and my cousin Westmoreland
Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed
To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop
Who as we hear are busily in arms
Myselfand you son Harrywill towards Wales
To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway
Meeting the check of such another day
And since this business so fair is done
Let us not leave till all our own be won

Exeunt
