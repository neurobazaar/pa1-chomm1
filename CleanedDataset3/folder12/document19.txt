Introductory Note

 The Song of Hiawatha is based on the legends and stories of
many North American Indian tribes but especially those of the
Ojibway Indians of northern Michigan Wisconsin and Minnesota
They were collected by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft the reknowned
historian pioneer explorer and geologist He was superintendent
of Indian affairs for Michigan from 1836 to 1841

 Schoolcraft married Jane Obahbahmwawagezhegoqua The
Woman of the Sound Which the Stars Make Rushing Through the Sky
Johnston Jane was a daughter of John Johnston an early Irish
fur trader and Oshauguscodaywayqua The Woman of the Green
Prairie who was a daughter of Waubojeeg The White Fisher
who was Chief of the Ojibway tribe at La Pointe Wisconsin

 Jane and her mother are credited with having researched
authenticated and compiled much of the material Schoolcraft
included in his Algic Researches 1839 and a revision published
in 1856 as The Myth of Hiawatha It was this latter revision
that Longfellow used as the basis for The Song of Hiawatha

 Longfellow began Hiawatha on June 25 1854 he completed it
on March 29 1855 and it was published November 10 1855 As
soon as the poem was published its popularity was assured
However it also was severely criticized as a plagiary of the
Finnish epic poem Kalevala Longfellow made no secret of the
fact that he had used the meter of the Kalevala but as for the
legends he openly gave credit to Schoolcraft in his notes to the
poem

 I would add a personal note here My fathers roots include
Ojibway Indians his mother Margaret Caroline Davenport was a
daughter of Susan des Carreaux Ogeeemaqua The Chief Woman
Davenport whose mother was a daughter of Chief Waubojeeg
Finally my mother used to rock me to sleep reading portions of
Hiawatha to me especially

 Wahwahtaysee little firefly
 Little flitting whitefire insect
 Little dancing whitefire creature
 Light me with your little candle
 Ere upon my bed I lay me
 Ere in sleep I close my eyelids

The Song of Hiawatha
Introduction

Should you ask me whence these stories
Whence these legends and traditions
With the odors of the forest
With the dew and damp of meadows
With the curling smoke of wigwams
With the rushing of great rivers
With their frequent repetitions
And their wild reverberations
As of thunder in the mountains

I should answer I should tell you
From the forests and the prairies
From the great lakes of the Northland
From the land of the Ojibways
From the land of the Dacotahs
From the mountains moors and fenlands
Where the heron the Shuhshuhgah
Feeds among the reeds and rushes
I repeat them as I heard them
From the lips of Nawadaha
The musician the sweet singer

Should you ask where Nawadaha
Found these songs so wild and wayward
Found these legends and traditions
I should answer I should tell you
In the birdsnests of the forest
In the lodges of the beaver
In the hoofprint of the bison
In the eyry of the eagle

All the wildfowl sang them to him
In the moorlands and the fenlands
In the melancholy marshes
Chetowaik the plover sang them
Mahng the loon the wildgoose Wawa
The blue heron the Shuhshuhgah
And the grouse the Mushkodasa

If still further you should ask me
Saying Who was Nawadaha
Tell us of this Nawadaha
I should answer your inquiries
Straightway in such words as follow

In the vale of Tawasentha
In the green and silent valley
By the pleasant watercourses
Dwelt the singer Nawadaha
Round about the Indian village
Spread the meadows and the cornfields
And beyond them stood the forest
Stood the groves of singing pinetrees
Green in Summer white in Winter
Ever sighing ever singing

And the pleasant watercourses
You could trace them through the valley
By the rushing in the Springtime
By the alders in the Summer
By the white fog in the Autumn
By the black line in the Winter
And beside them dwelt the singer
In the vale of Tawasentha
In the green and silent valley

There he sang of Hiawatha
Sang the Song of Hiawatha
Sang his wondrous birth and being
How he prayed and how be fasted
How he lived and toiled and suffered
That the tribes of men might prosper
That he might advance his people

Ye who love the haunts of Nature
Love the sunshine of the meadow
Love the shadow of the forest
Love the wind among the branches
And the rainshower and the snowstorm
And the rushing of great rivers
Through their palisades of pinetrees
And the thunder in the mountains
Whose innumerable echoes
Flap like eagles in their eyries
Listen to these wild traditions
To this Song of Hiawatha

Ye who love a nations legends
Love the ballads of a people
That like voices from afar off
Call to us to pause and listen
Speak in tones so plain and childlike
Scarcely can the ear distinguish
Whether they are sung or spoken
Listen to this Indian Legend
To this Song of Hiawatha

Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple
Who have faith in God and Nature
Who believe that in all ages
Every human heart is human
That in even savage bosoms
There are longings yearnings strivings
For the good they comprehend not
That the feeble hands and helpless
Groping blindly in the darkness
Touch Gods right hand in that darkness
And are lifted up and strengthened
Listen to this simple story
To this Song of Hiawatha

Ye who sometimes in your rambles
Through the green lanes of the country
Where the tangled barberrybushes
Hang their tufts of crimson berries
Over stone walls gray with mosses
Pause by some neglected graveyard
For a while to muse and ponder
On a halfeffaced inscription
Written with little skill of songcraft
Homely phrases but each letter
Full of hope and yet of heartbreak
Full of all the tender pathos
Of the Here and the Hereafter
Stay and read this rude inscription
Read this Song of Hiawatha

 The PeacePipe

On the Mountains of the Prairie
On the great Red Pipestone Quarry
Gitche Manito the mighty
He the Master of Life descending
On the red crags of the quarry
Stood erect and called the nations
Called the tribes of men together

From his footprints flowed a river
Leaped into the light of morning
Oer the precipice plunging downward
Gleamed like Ishkoodah the comet
And the Spirit stooping earthward
With his finger on the meadow
Traced a winding pathway for it
Saying to it Run in this way

From the red stone of the quarry
With his hand he broke a fragment
Moulded it into a pipehead
Shaped and fashioned it with figures
From the margin of the river
Took a long reed for a pipestem
With its dark green leaves upon it
Filled the pipe with bark of willow
With the bark of the red willow
Breathed upon the neighboring forest
Made its great boughs chafe together
Till in flame they burst and kindled
And erect upon the mountains
Gitche Manito the mighty
Smoked the calumet the PeacePipe
As a signal to the nations

And the smoke rose slowly slowly
Through the tranquil air of morning
First a single line of darkness
Then a denser bluer vapor
Then a snowwhite cloud unfolding
Like the treetops of the forest
Ever rising rising rising
Till it touched the top of heaven
Till it broke against the heaven
And rolled outward all around it

From the Vale of Tawasentha
From the Valley of Wyoming
From the groves of Tuscaloosa
From the faroff Rocky Mountains
From the Northern lakes and rivers
All the tribes beheld the signal
Saw the distant smoke ascending
The Pukwana of the PeacePipe

And the Prophets of the nations
Said Behold it the Pukwana
By the signal of the PeacePipe
Bending like a wand of willow
Waving like a hand that beckons
Gitche Manito the mighty
Calls the tribes of men together
Calls the warriors to his council

Down the rivers oer the prairies
Came the warriors of the nations
Came the Delawares and Mohawks
Came the Choctaws and Camanches
Came the Shoshonies and Blackfeet
Came the Pawnees and Omahas

Came the Mandans and Dacotahs
Came the Hurons and Ojibways
All the warriors drawn together
By the signal of the PeacePipe
To the Mountains of the Prairie
To the great Red Pipestone Quarry

And they stood there on the meadow
With their weapons and their wargear
Painted like the leaves of Autumn
Painted like the sky of morning
Wildly glaring at each other
In their faces stern defiance
In their hearts the feuds of ages
The hereditary hatred
The ancestral thirst of vengeance

Gitche Manito the mighty
The creator of the nations
Looked upon them with compassion
With paternal love and pity
Looked upon their wrath and wrangling
But as quarrels among children
But as feuds and fights of children

Over them he stretched his right hand
To subdue their stubborn natures
To allay their thirst and fever
By the shadow of his right hand
Spake to them with voice majestic
As the sound of faroff waters
Falling into deep abysses
Warning chiding spake in this wise

O my children my poor children
Listen to the words of wisdom
Listen to the words of warning
From the lips of the Great Spirit
From the Master of Life who made you

I have given you lands to hunt in
I have given you streams to fish in
I have given you bear and bison
I have given you roe and reindeer
I have given you brant and beaver
Filled the marshes full of wildfowl
Filled the rivers full of fishes
Why then are you not contented
Why then will you hunt each other

I am weary of your quarrels
Weary of your wars and bloodshed
Weary of your prayers for vengeance
Of your wranglings and dissensions
All your strength is in your union
All your danger is in discord
Therefore be at peace henceforward
And as brothers live together

I will send a Prophet to you
A Deliverer of the nations
Who shall guide you and shall teach you
Who shall toil and suffer with you
If you listen to his counsels
You will multiply and prosper
If his warnings pass unheeded
You will fade away and perish

Bathe now in the stream before you
Wash the warpaint from your faces
Wash the bloodstains from your fingers
Bury your warclubs and your weapons
Break the red stone from this quarry
Mould and make it into PeacePipes
Take the reeds that grow beside you
Deck them with your brightest feathers
Smoke the calumet together
And as brothers live henceforward

Then upon the ground the warriors
Threw their cloaks and shirts of deerskin
Threw their weapons and their wargear
Leaped into the rushing river
Washed the warpaint from their faces
Clear above them flowed the water
Clear and limpid from the footprints
Of the Master of Life descending
Dark below them flowed the water
Soiled and stained with streaks of crimson
As if blood were mingled with it

From the river came the warriors
Clean and washed from all their warpaint
On the banks their clubs they buried
Buried all their warlike weapons
Gitche Manito the mighty
The Great Spirit the creator
Smiled upon his helpless children

And in silence all the warriors
Broke the red stone of the quarry
Smoothed and formed it into PeacePipes
Broke the long reeds by the river
Decked them with their brightest feathers
And departed each one homeward
While the Master of Life ascending
Through the opening of cloudcurtains
Through the doorways of the heaven
Vanished from before their faces
In the smoke that rolled around him
The Pukwana of the PeacePipe

 The Four Winds

Honor be to Mudjekeewis
Cried the warriors cried the old men
When he came in triumph homeward
With the sacred Belt of Wampum
From the regions of the NorthWind
From the kingdom of Wabasso
From the land of the White Rabbit

He had stolen the Belt of Wampum
From the neck of MisheMokwa
From the Great Bear of the mountains
From the terror of the nations
As he lay asleep and cumbrous
On the summit of the mountains
Like a rock with mosses on it
Spotted brown and gray with mosses

Silently he stole upon him
Till the red nails of the monster
Almost touched him almost scared him
Till the hot breath of his nostrils
Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis
As he drew the Belt of Wampum
Over the round ears that heard not
Over the small eyes that saw not
Over the long nose and nostrils
The black muffle of the nostrils
Out of which the heavy breathing
Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis

Then he swung aloft his warclub
Shouted loud and long his warcry
Smote the mighty MisheMokwa
In the middle of the forehead
Right between the eyes he smote him

With the heavy blow bewildered
Rose the Great Bear of the mountains
But his knees beneath him trembled
And he whimpered like a woman
As he reeled and staggered forward
As he sat upon his haunches
And the mighty Mudjekeewis
Standing fearlessly before him
Taunted him in loud derision
Spake disdainfully in this wise

Hark you Bear you are a coward
And no Brave as you pretended
Else you would not cry and whimper
Like a miserable woman
Bear you know our tribes are hostile
Long have been at war together
Now you find that we are strongest
You go sneaking in the forest
You go hiding in the mountains
Had you conquered me in battle
Not a groan would I have uttered
But you Bear sit here and whimper
And disgrace your tribe by crying
Like a wretched Shaugodaya
Like a cowardly old woman

Then again he raised his warclub
Smote again the MisheMokwa
In the middle of his forehead
Broke his skull as ice is broken
When one goes to fish in Winter
Thus was slain the MisheMokwa
He the Great Bear of the mountains
He the terror of the nations

Honor be to Mudjekeewis
With a shout exclaimed the people
Honor be to Mudjekeewis
Henceforth he shall be the WestWind
And hereafter and forever
Shall he hold supreme dominion
Over all the winds of heaven
Call him no more Mudjekeewis
Call him Kabeyun the WestWind

Thus was Mudjekeewis chosen
Father of the Winds of Heaven
For himself he kept the WestWind
Gave the others to his children
Unto Wabun gave the EastWind
Gave the South to Shawondasee
And the NorthWind wild and cruel
To the fierce Kabibonokka

Young and beautiful was Wabun
He it was who brought the morning
He it was whose silver arrows
Chased the dark oer hill and valley
He it was whose cheeks were painted
With the brightest streaks of crimson
And whose voice awoke the village
Called the deer and called the hunter

Lonely in the sky was Wabun
Though the birds sang gayly to him
Though the wildflowers of the meadow
Filled the air with odors for him
Though the forests and the rivers
Sang and shouted at his coming
Still his heart was sad within him
For he was alone in heaven

But one morning gazing earthward
While the village still was sleeping
And the fog lay on the river
Like a ghost that goes at sunrise
He beheld a maiden walking
All alone upon a meadow
Gathering waterflags and rushes
By a river in the meadow

Every morning gazing earthward
Still the first thing he beheld there
Was her blue eyes looking at him
Two blue lakes among the rushes
And he loved the lonely maiden
Who thus waited for his coming
For they both were solitary
She on earth and he in heaven

And he wooed her with caresses
Wooed her with his smile of sunshine
With his flattering words he wooed her
With his sighing and his singing
Gentlest whispers in the branches
Softest music sweetest odors
Till he drew her to his bosom
Folded in his robes of crimson
Till into a star he changed her
Trembling still upon his bosom
And forever in the heavens
They are seen together walking
Wabun and the WabunAnnung
Wabun and the Star of Morning

But the fierce Kabibonokka
Had his dwelling among icebergs
In the everlasting snowdrifts
In the kingdom of Wabasso
In the land of the White Rabbit
He it was whose hand in Autumn
Painted all the trees with scarlet
Stained the leaves with red and yellow
He it was who sent the snowflake
Sifting hissing through the forest
Froze the ponds the lakes the rivers
Drove the loon and seagull southward
Drove the cormorant and curlew
To their nests of sedge and seatang
In the realms of Shawondasee

Once the fierce Kabibonokka
Issued from his lodge of snowdrifts
From his home among the icebergs
And his hair with snow besprinkled
Streamed behind him like a river
Like a black and wintry river
As he howled and hurried southward
Over frozen lakes and moorlands

There among the reeds and rushes
Found he Shingebis the diver
Trailing strings of fish behind him
Oer the frozen fens and moorlands
Lingering still among the moorlands
Though his tribe had long departed
To the land of Shawondasee

Cried the fierce Kabibonokka
Who is this that dares to brave me
Dares to stay in my dominions
When the Wawa has departed
When the wildgoose has gone southward
And the heron the Shuhshuhgah
Long ago departed southward
I will go into his wigwam
I will put his smouldering fire out

And at night Kabibonokka
To the lodge came wild and wailing
Heaped the snow in drifts about it
Shouted down into the smokeflue
Shook the lodgepoles in his fury
Flapped the curtain of the doorway
Shingebis the diver feared not
Shingebis the diver cared not
Four great logs had he for firewood
One for each moon of the winter
And for food the fishes served him
By his blazing fire he sat there
Warm and merry eating laughing
Singing O Kabibonokka
You are but my fellowmortal

Then Kabibonokka entered
And though Shingebis the diver
Felt his presence by the coldness
Felt his icy breath upon him
Still he did not cease his singing
Still he did not leave his laughing
Only turned the log a little
Only made the fire burn brighter
Made the sparks fly up the smokeflue

From Kabibonokkas forehead
From his snowbesprinkled tresses
Drops of sweat fell fast and heavy
Making dints upon the ashes
As along the eaves of lodges
As from drooping boughs of hemlock
Drips the melting snow in springtime
Making hollows in the snowdrifts

Till at last he rose defeated
Could not bear the heat and laughter
Could not bear the merry singing
But rushed headlong through the doorway
Stamped upon the crusted snowdrifts
Stamped upon the lakes and rivers
Made the snow upon them harder
Made the ice upon them thicker
Challenged Shingebis the diver
To come forth and wrestle with him
To come forth and wrestle naked
On the frozen fens and moorlands

Forth went Shingebis the diver
Wrestled all night with the NorthWind
Wrestled naked on the moorlands
With the fierce Kabibonokka
Till his panting breath grew fainter
Till his frozen grasp grew feebler
Till he reeled and staggered backward
And retreated baffled beaten
To the kingdom of Wabasso
To the land of the White Rabbit
Hearing still the gusty laughter
Hearing Shingebis the diver
Singing O Kabibonokka
You are but my fellowmortal

Shawondasee fat and lazy
Had his dwelling far to southward
In the drowsy dreamy sunshine
In the neverending Summer
He it was who sent the woodbirds
Sent the robin the Opechee
Sent the bluebird the Owaissa
Sent the Shawshaw sent the swallow
Sent the wildgoose Wawa northward
Sent the melons and tobacco
And the grapes in purple clusters

From his pipe the smoke ascending
Filled the sky with haze and vapor
Filled the air with dreamy softness
Gave a twinkle to the water
Touched the rugged hills with smoothness
Brought the tender Indian Summer
To the melancholy northland
In the dreary Moon of Snowshoes

Listless careless Shawondasee
In his life he had one shadow
In his heart one sorrow had he
Once as he was gazing northward
Far away upon a prairie
He beheld a maiden standing
Saw a tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie
Brightest green were all her garments
And her hair was like the sunshine

Day by day he gazed upon her
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day his heart within him
Grew more hot with love and longing
For the maid with yellow tresses
But he was too fat and lazy
To bestir himself and woo her
Yes too indolent and easy
To pursue her and persuade her
So he only gazed upon her
Only sat and sighed with passion
For the maiden of the prairie

Till one morning looking northward
He beheld her yellow tresses
Changed and covered oer with whiteness
Covered as with whitest snowflakes
Ah my brother from the Northland
From the kingdom of Wabasso
From the land of the White Rabbit
You have stolen the maiden from me
You have laid your hand upon her
You have wooed and won my maiden
With your stories of the Northland

Thus the wretched Shawondasee
Breathed into the air his sorrow
And the SouthWind oer the prairie
Wandered warm with sighs of passion
With the sighs of Shawondasee
Till the air seemed full of snowflakes
Full of thistledown the prairie
And the maid with hair like sunshine
Vanished from his sight forever
Never more did Shawondasee
See the maid with yellow tresses

Poor deluded Shawondasee
T was no woman that you gazed at
T was no maiden that you sighed for
T was the prairie dandelion
That through all the dreamy Summer
You had gazed at with such longing
You had sighed for with such passion
And had puffed away forever
Blown into the air with sighing
Ah deluded Shawondasee

Thus the Four Winds were divided
Thus the sons of Mudjekeewis
Had their stations in the heavens
At the corners of the heavens
For himself the WestWind only
Kept the mighty Mudjekeewis



 III

 Hiawathas Childhood

Downward through the evening twilight
In the days that are forgotten
In the unremembered ages
From the full moon fell Nokomis
Fell the beautiful Nokomis
She a wife but not a mother

She was sporting with her women
Swinging in a swing of grapevines
When her rival the rejected
Full of jealousy and hatred
Cut the leafy swing asunder
Cut in twain the twisted grapevines
And Nokomis fell affrighted
Downward through the evening twilight
On the Muskoday the meadow
On the prairie full of blossoms
See a star falls said the people
From the sky a star is falling

There among the ferns and mosses
There among the prairie lilies
On the Muskoday the meadow
In the moonlight and the starlight
Fair Nokomis bore a daughter
And she called her name Wenonah
As the firstborn of her daughters
And the daughter of Nokomis
Grew up like the prairie lilies
Grew a tall and slender maiden
With the beauty of the moonlight
With the beauty of the starlight

And Nokomis warned her often
Saying oft and oft repeating
Oh beware of Mudjekeewis
Of the WestWind Mudjekeewis
Listen not to what he tells you
Lie not down upon the meadow
Stoop not down among the lilies
Lest the WestWind come and harm you

But she heeded not the warning
Heeded not those words of wisdom
And the WestWind came at evening
Walking lightly oer the prairie
Whispering to the leaves and blossoms
Bending low the flowers and grasses
Found the beautiful Wenonah
Lying there among the lilies
Wooed her with his words of sweetness
Wooed her with his soft caresses
Till she bore a son in sorrow
Bore a son of love and sorrow

Thus was born my Hiawatha
Thus was born the child of wonder
But the daughter of Nokomis
Hiawathas gentle mother
In her anguish died deserted
By the WestWind false and faithless
By the heartless Mudjekeewis

For her daughter long and loudly
Wailed and wept the sad Nokomis
Oh that I were dead she murmured
Oh that I were dead as thou art
No more work and no more weeping
Wahonowin Wahonowin

By the shores of Gitche Gumee
By the shining BigSeaWater
Stood the wigwam of Nokomis
Daughter of the Moon Nokomis
Dark behind it rose the forest
Rose the black and gloomy pinetrees
Rose the firs with cones upon them
Bright before it beat the water
Beat the clear and sunny water
Beat the shining BigSeaWater

There the wrinkled old Nokomis
Nursed the little Hiawatha
Rocked him in his linden cradle
Bedded soft in moss and rushes
Safely bound with reindeer sinews
Stilled his fretful wail by saying
Hush the Naked Bear will hear thee
Lulled him into slumber singing
Ewayea my little owlet
Who is this that lights the wigwam
With his great eyes lights the wigwam
Ewayea my little owlet

Many things Nokomis taught him
Of the stars that shine in heaven
Showed him Ishkoodah the comet
Ishkoodah with fiery tresses
Showed the DeathDance of the spirits
Warriors with their plumes and warclubs
Flaring far away to northward
In the frosty nights of Winter
Showed the broad white road in heaven
Pathway of the ghosts the shadows
Running straight across the heavens
Crowded with the ghosts the shadows

At the door on summer evenings
Sat the little Hiawatha
Heard the whispering of the pinetrees
Heard the lapping of the waters
Sounds of music words of wonder
Minnewawa said the Pinetrees
Mudwayaushka said the water

Saw the firefly Wahwahtaysee
Flitting through the dusk of evening
With the twinkle of its candle
Lighting up the brakes and bushes
And he sang the song of children
Sang the song Nokomis taught him
Wahwahtaysee little firefly
Little flitting whitefire insect
Little dancing whitefire creature
Light me with your little candle
Ere upon my bed I lay me
Ere in sleep I close my eyelids

Saw the moon rise from the water
Rippling rounding from the water
Saw the flecks and shadows on it
Whispered What is that Nokomis
And the good Nokomis answered
Once a warrior very angry
Seized his grandmother and threw her
Up into the sky at midnight
Right against the moon he threw her
T is her body that you see there

Saw the rainbow in the heaven
In the eastern sky the rainbow
Whispered What is that Nokomis
And the good Nokomis answered
T is the heaven of flowers you see there
All the wildflowers of the forest
All the lilies of the prairie
When on earth they fade and perish
Blossom in that heaven above us

When he heard the owls at midnight
Hooting laughing in the forest
What is that he cried in terror
What is that he said Nokomis
And the good Nokomis answered
That is but the owl and owlet
Talking in their native language
Talking scolding at each other

Then the little Hiawatha
Learned of every bird its language
Learned their names and all their secrets
How they built their nests in Summer
Where they hid themselves in Winter
Talked with them wheneer he met them
Called them Hiawathas Chickens

Of all beasts he learned the language
Learned their names and all their secrets
How the beavers built their lodges
Where the squirrels hid their acorns
How the reindeer ran so swiftly
Why the rabbit was so timid
Talked with them wheneer he met them
Called them Hiawathas Brothers

Then Iagoo the great boaster
He the marvellous storyteller
He the traveller and the talker
He the friend of old Nokomis
Made a bow for Hiawatha
From a branch of ash he made it
From an oakbough made the arrows
Tipped with flint and winged with feathers
And the cord he made of deerskin

Then he said to Hiawatha
Go my son into the forest
Where the red deer herd together
Kill for us a famous roebuck
Kill for us a deer with antlers

Forth into the forest straightway
All alone walked Hiawatha
Proudly with his bow and arrows
And the birds sang round him oer him
Do not shoot us Hiawatha
Sang the robin the Opechee
Sang the bluebird the Owaissa
Do not shoot us Hiawatha

Up the oaktree close beside him
Sprang the squirrel Adjidaumo
In and out among the branches
Coughed and chattered from the oaktree
Laughed and said between his laughing
Do not shoot me Hiawatha

And the rabbit from his pathway
Leaped aside and at a distance
Sat erect upon his haunches
Half in fear and half in frolic
Saying to the little hunter
Do not shoot me Hiawatha

But he heeded not nor heard them
For his thoughts were with the red deer
On their tracks his eyes were fastened
Leading downward to the river
To the ford across the river
And as one in slumber walked he

Hidden in the alderbushes
There he waited till the deer came
Till he saw two antlers lifted
Saw two eyes look from the thicket
Saw two nostrils point to windward
And a deer came down the pathway
Flecked with leafy light and shadow
And his heart within him fluttered
Trembled like the leaves above him
Like the birchleaf palpitated
As the deer came down the pathway

Then upon one knee uprising
Hiawatha aimed an arrow
Scarce a twig moved with his motion
Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled
But the wary roebuck started
Stamped with all his hoofs together
Listened with one foot uplifted
Leaped as if to meet the arrow
Ah the singing fatal arrow
Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him

Dead he lay there in the forest
By the ford across the river
Beat his timid heart no longer
But the heart of Hiawatha
Throbbed and shouted and exulted
As he bore the red deer homeward
And Iagoo and Nokomis
Hailed his coming with applauses

From the red deers hide Nokomis
Made a cloak for Hiawatha
From the red deers flesh Nokomis
Made a banquet to his honor
All the village came and feasted
All the guests praised Hiawatha
Called him StrongHeart Soangetaha
Called him LoonHeart Mahngotaysee

 Hiawatha and Mudjekeewis

Out of childhood into manhood
Now had grown my Hiawatha
Skilled in all the craft of hunters
Learned in all the lore of old men
In all youthful sports and pastimes
In all manly arts and labors

Swift of foot was Hiawatha
He could shoot an arrow from him
And run forward with such fleetness
That the arrow fell behind him
Strong of arm was Hiawatha
He could shoot ten arrows upward
Shoot them with such strength and swiftness
That the tenth had left the bowstring
Ere the first to earth had fallen

He had mittens Minjekahwun
Magic mittens made of deerskin
When upon his hands he wore them
He could smite the rocks asunder
He could grind them into powder
He had moccasins enchanted
Magic moccasins of deerskin
When he bound them round his ankles
When upon his feet he tied them
At each stride a mile he measured

Much he questioned old Nokomis
Of his father Mudjekeewis
Learned from her the fatal secret
Of the beauty of his mother
Of the falsehood of his father
And his heart was hot within him
Like a living coal his heart was

Then he said to old Nokomis
I will go to Mudjekeewis
See how fares it with my father
At the doorways of the WestWind
At the portals of the Sunset

From his lodge went Hiawatha
Dressed for travel armed for hunting
Dressed in deerskin shirt and leggings
Richly wrought with quills and wampum
On his head his eaglefeathers
Round his waist his belt of wampum
In his hand his bow of ashwood
Strung with sinews of the reindeer
In his quiver oaken arrows
Tipped with jasper winged with feathers
With his mittens Minjekahwun
With his moccasins enchanted

Warning said the old Nokomis
Go not forth O Hiawatha
To the kingdom of the WestWind
To the realms of Mudjekeewis
Lest he harm you with his magic
Lest he kill you with his cunning

But the fearless Hiawatha
Heeded not her womans warning
Forth he strode into the forest
At each stride a mile he measured
Lurid seemed the sky above him
Lurid seemed the earth beneath him
Hot and close the air around him
Filled with smoke and fiery vapors
As of burning woods and prairies
For his heart was hot within him
Like a living coal his heart was

So he journeyed westward westward
Left the fleetest deer behind him
Left the antelope and bison
Crossed the rushing Esconaba
Crossed the mighty Mississippi
Passed the Mountains of the Prairie
Passed the land of Crows and Foxes
Passed the dwellings of the Blackfeet
Came unto the Rocky Mountains
To the kingdom of the WestWind
Where upon the gusty summits
Sat the ancient Mudjekeewis
Ruler of the winds of heaven

Filled with awe was Hiawatha
At the aspect of his father
On the air about him wildly
Tossed and streamed his cloudy tresses
Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses
Glared like Ishkoodah the comet
Like the star with fiery tresses

Filled with joy was Mudjekeewis
When he looked on Hiawatha
Saw his youth rise up before him
In the face of Hiawatha
Saw the beauty of Wenonah
From the grave rise up before him

Welcome said he Hiawatha
To the kingdom of the WestWind
Long have I been waiting for you
Youth is lovely age is lonely
Youth is fiery age is frosty
You bring back the days departed
You bring back my youth of passion
And the beautiful Wenonah

Many days they talked together
Questioned listened waited answered
Much the mighty Mudjekeewis
Boasted of his ancient prowess
Of his perilous adventures
His indomitable courage
His invulnerable body

Patiently sat Hiawatha
Listening to his fathers boasting
With a smile he sat and listened
Uttered neither threat nor menace
Neither word nor look betrayed him
But his heart was hot within him
Like a living coal his heart was

Then he said O Mudjekeewis
Is there nothing that can harm you
Nothing that you are afraid of
And the mighty Mudjekeewis
Grand and gracious in his boasting
Answered saying There is nothing
Nothing but the black rock yonder
Nothing but the fatal Wawbeek

And he looked at Hiawatha
With a wise look and benignant
With a countenance paternal
Looked with pride upon the beauty
Of his tall and graceful figure
Saying O my Hiawatha
Is there anything can harm you
Anything you are afraid of

But the wary Hiawatha
Paused awhile as if uncertain
Held his peace as if resolving
And then answered There is nothing
Nothing but the bulrush yonder
Nothing but the great Apukwa

And as Mudjekeewis rising
Stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush
Hiawatha cried in terror
Cried in welldissembled terror
Kago kago do not touch it
Ah kaween said Mudjekeewis
No indeed I will not touch it

Then they talked of other matters
First of Hiawathas brothers
First of Wabun of the EastWind
Of the SouthWind Shawondasee
Of the North Kabibonokka
Then of Hiawathas mother
Of the beautiful Wenonah
Of her birth upon the meadow
Of her death as old Nokomis
Had remembered and related

And he cried O Mudjekeewis
It was you who killed Wenonah
Took her young life and her beauty
Broke the Lily of the Prairie
Trampled it beneath your footsteps
You confess it you confess it
And the mighty Mudjekeewis
Tossed upon the wind his tresses
Bowed his hoary head in anguish
With a silent nod assented

Then up started Hiawatha
And with threatening look and gesture
Laid his hand upon the black rock
On the fatal Wawbeek laid it
With his mittens Minjekahwun
Rent the jutting crag asunder
Smote and crushed it into fragments
Hurled them madly at his father
The remorseful Mudjekeewis
For his heart was hot within him
Like a living coal his heart was

But the ruler of the WestWind
Blew the fragments backward from him
With the breathing of his nostrils
With the tempest of his anger
Blew them back at his assailant
Seized the bulrush the Apukwa
Dragged it with its roots and fibres
From the margin of the meadow
From its ooze the giant bulrush
Long and loud laughed Hiawatha

Then began the deadly conflict
Hand to hand among the mountains
From his eyry screamed the eagle
The Keneu the great wareagle
Sat upon the crags around them
Wheeling flapped his wings above them

Like a tall tree in the tempest
Bent and lashed the giant bulrush
And in masses huge and heavy
Crashing fell the fatal Wawbeek
Till the earth shook with the tumult
And confusion of the battle
And the air was full of shoutings
And the thunder of the mountains
Starting answered Baimwawa

Back retreated Mudjekeewis
Rushing westward oer the mountains
Stumbling westward down the mountains
Three whole days retreated fighting
Still pursued by Hiawatha
To the doorways of the WestWind
To the portals of the Sunset
To the earths remotest border
Where into the empty spaces
Sinks the sun as a flamingo
Drops into her nest at nightfall
In the melancholy marshes

Hold at length cried Mudjekeewis
Hold my son my Hiawatha
T is impossible to kill me
For you cannot kill the immortal
I have put you to this trial
But to know and prove your courage
Now receive the prize of valor

Go back to your home and people
Live among them toil among them
Cleanse the earth from all that harms it
Clear the fishinggrounds and rivers
Slay all monsters and magicians
All the Wendigoes the giants
All the serpents the Kenabeeks
As I slew the MisheMokwa
Slew the Great Bear of the mountains

And at last when Death draws near you
When the awful eyes of Pauguk
Glare upon you in the darkness
I will share my kingdom with you
Ruler shall you be thenceforward
Of the NorthwestWind Keewaydin
Of the homewind the Keewaydin

Thus was fought that famous battle
In the dreadful days of Shahshah
In the days long since departed
In the kingdom of the WestWind
Still the hunter sees its traces
Scattered far oer hill and valley
Sees the giant bulrush growing
By the ponds and watercourses
Sees the masses of the Wawbeek
Lying still in every valley

Homeward now went Hiawatha
Pleasant was the landscape round him
Pleasant was the air above him
For the bitterness of anger
Had departed wholly from him
From his brain the thought of vengeance
From his heart the burning fever

Only once his pace he slackened
Only once he paused or halted
Paused to purchase heads of arrows
Of the ancient Arrowmaker
In the land of the Dacotahs
Where the Falls of Minnehaha
Flash and gleam among the oaktrees
Laugh and leap into the valley

There the ancient Arrowmaker
Made his arrowheads of sandstone
Arrowheads of chalcedony
Arrowheads of flint and jasper
Smoothed and sharpened at the edges
Hard and polished keen and costly

With him dwelt his darkeyed daughter
Wayward as the Minnehaha
With her moods of shade and sunshine
Eyes that smiled and frowned alternate
Feet as rapid as the river
Tresses flowing like the water
And as musical a laughter
And he named her from the river
From the waterfall he named her
Minnehaha Laughing Water

Was it then for heads of arrows
Arrowheads of chalcedony
Arrowheads of flint and jasper
That my Hiawatha halted
In the land of the Dacotahs

Was it not to see the maiden
See the face of Laughing Water
Peeping from behind the curtain
Hear the rustling of her garments
From behind the waving curtain
As one sees the Minnehaha
Gleaming glancing through the branches
As one hears the Laughing Water
From behind its screen of branches

Who shall say what thoughts and visions
Fill the fiery brains of young men
Who shall say what dreams of beauty
Filled the heart of Hiawatha
All he told to old Nokomis
When he reached the lodge at sunset
Was the meeting with his father
Was his fight with Mudjekeewis
Not a word he said of arrows
Not a word of Laughing Water



 V

 Hiawathas Fasting

You shall hear how Hiawatha
Prayed and fasted in the forest
Not for greater skill in hunting
Not for greater craft in fishing
Not for triumphs in the battle
And renown among the warriors
But for profit of the people
For advantage of the nations

First he built a lodge for fasting
Built a wigwam in the forest
By the shining BigSeaWater
In the blithe and pleasant Springtime
In the Moon of Leaves he built it
And with dreams and visions many
Seven whole days and nights he fasted

On the first day of his fasting
Through the leafy woods he wandered
Saw the deer start from the thicket
Saw the rabbit in his burrow
Heard the pheasant Bena drumming
Heard the squirrel Adjidaumo
Rattling in his hoard of acorns
Saw the pigeon the Omeme
Building nests among the pinetrees
And in flocks the wildgoose Wawa
Flying to the fenlands northward
Whirring wailing far above him
Master of Life he cried desponding
Must our lives depend on these things

On the next day of his fasting
By the rivers brink he wandered
Through the Muskoday the meadow
Saw the wild rice Mahnomonee
Saw the blueberry Meenahga
And the strawberry Odahmin
And the gooseberry Shahbomin
And the grapevine the Bemahgut
Trailing oer the alderbranches
Filling all the air with fragrance
Master of Life he cried desponding
Must our lives depend on these things

On the third day of his fasting
By the lake he sat and pondered
By the still transparent water
Saw the sturgeon Nahma leaping
Scattering drops like beads of wampum
Saw the yellow perch the Sahwa
Like a sunbeam in the water
Saw the pike the Maskenozha
And the herring Okahahwis
And the Shawgashee the crawfish
Master of Life he cried desponding
Must our lives depend on these things

On the fourth day of his fasting
In his lodge he lay exhausted
From his couch of leaves and branches
Gazing with halfopen eyelids
Full of shadowy dreams and visions
On the dizzy swimming landscape
On the gleaming of the water
On the splendor of the sunset

And he saw a youth approaching
Dressed in garments green and yellow
Coming through the purple twilight
Through the splendor of the sunset
Plumes of green bent oer his forehead
And his hair was soft and golden

Standing at the open doorway
Long he looked at Hiawatha
Looked with pity and compassion
On his wasted form and features
And in accents like the sighing
Of the SouthWind in the treetops
Said he O my Hiawatha
All your prayers are heard in heaven
For you pray not like the others
Not for greater skill in hunting
Not for greater craft in fishing
Not for triumph in the battle
Nor renown among the warriors
But for profit of the people
For advantage of the nations

From the Master of Life descending
I the friend of man Mondamin
Come to warn you and instruct you
How by struggle and by labor
You shall gain what you have prayed for
Rise up from your bed of branches
Rise O youth and wrestle with me

Faint with famine Hiawatha
Started from his bed of branches
From the twilight of his wigwam
Forth into the flush of sunset
Came and wrestled with Mondamin
At his touch he felt new courage
Throbbing in his brain and bosom
Felt new life and hope and vigor
Run through every nerve and fibre

So they wrestled there together
In the glory of the sunset
And the more they strove and struggled
Stronger still grew Hiawatha
Till the darkness fell around them
And the heron the Shuhshuhgah
From her nest among the pinetrees
Gave a cry of lamentation
Gave a scream of pain and famine

T is enough then said Mondamin
Smiling upon Hiawatha
But tomorrow when the sun sets
I will come again to try you
And he vanished and was seen not
Whether sinking as the rain sinks
Whether rising as the mists rise
Hiawatha saw not knew not
Only saw that he had vanished
Leaving him alone and fainting
With the misty lake below him
And the reeling stars above him

On the morrow and the next day
When the sun through heaven descending
Like a red and burning cinder
From the hearth of the Great Spirit
Fell into the western waters
Came Mondamin for the trial
For the strife with Hiawatha
Came as silent as the dew comes
From the empty air appearing
Into empty air returning
Taking shape when earth it touches
But invisible to all men
In its coming and its going

Thrice they wrestled there together
In the glory of the sunset
Till the darkness fell around them
Till the heron the Shuhshuhgah
From her nest among the pinetrees
Uttered her loud cry of famine
And Mondamin paused to listen

Tall and beautiful he stood there
In his garments green and yellow
To and fro his plumes above him
Waved and nodded with his breathing
And the sweat of the encounter
Stood like drops of dew upon him

And he cried O Hiawatha
Bravely have you wrestled with me
Thrice have wrestled stoutly with me
And the Master of Life who sees us
He will give to you the triumph

Then he smiled and said Tomorrow
Is the last day of your conflict
Is the last day of your fasting
You will conquer and oercome me
Make a bed for me to lie in
Where the rain may fall upon me
Where the sun may come and warm me
Strip these garments green and yellow
Strip this nodding plumage from me
Lay me in the earth and make it
Soft and loose and light above me

Let no hand disturb my slumber
Let no weed nor worm molest me
Let not Kahgahgee the raven
Come to haunt me and molest me
Only come yourself to watch me
Till I wake and start and quicken
Till I leap into the sunshine

And thus saying he departed
Peacefully slept Hiawatha
But he heard the Wawonaissa
Heard the whippoorwill complaining
Perched upon his lonely wigwam
Heard the rushing Sebowisha
Heard the rivulet rippling near him
Talking to the darksome forest
Heard the sighing of the branches
As they lifted and subsided
At the passing of the nightwind
Heard them as one hears in slumber
Faroff murmurs dreamy whispers
Peacefully slept Hiawatha

On the morrow came Nokomis
On the seventh day of his fasting
Came with food for Hiawatha
Came imploring and bewailing
Lest his hunger should oercome him
Lest his fasting should be fatal

But he tasted not and touched not
Only said to her Nokomis
Wait until the sun is setting
Till the darkness falls around us
Till the heron the Shuhshuhgah
Crying from the desolate marshes
Tells us that the day is ended

Homeward weeping went Nokomis
Sorrowing for her Hiawatha
Fearing lest his strength should fail him
Lest his fasting should be fatal
He meanwhile sat weary waiting
For the coming of Mondamin
Till the shadows pointing eastward
Lengthened over field and forest
Till the sun dropped from the heaven
Floating on the waters westward
As a red leaf in the Autumn
Falls and floats upon the water
Falls and sinks into its bosom

And behold the young Mondamin
With his soft and shining tresses
With his garments green and yellow
With his long and glossy plumage
Stood and beckoned at the doorway
And as one in slumber walking
Pale and haggard but undaunted
From the wigwam Hiawatha
Came and wrestled with Mondamin

Round about him spun the landscape
Sky and forest reeled together
And his strong heart leaped within him
As the sturgeon leaps and struggles
In a net to break its meshes
Like a ring of fire around him
Blazed and flared the red horizon
And a hundred suns seemed looking
At the combat of the wrestlers

Suddenly upon the greensward
All alone stood Hiawatha
Panting with his wild exertion
Palpitating with the struggle
And before him breathless lifeless
Lay the youth with hair dishevelled
Plumage torn and garments tattered
Dead he lay there in the sunset

And victorious Hiawatha
Made the grave as he commanded
Stripped the garments from Mondamin
Stripped his tattered plumage from him
Laid him in the earth and made it
Soft and loose and light above him
And the heron the Shuhshuhgah
From the melancholy moorlands
Gave a cry of lamentation
Gave a cry of pain and anguish

Homeward then went Hiawatha
To the lodge of old Nokomis
And the seven days of his fasting
Were accomplished and completed
But the place was not forgotten
Where he wrestled with Mondamin
Nor forgotten nor neglected
Was the grave where lay Mondamin
Sleeping in the rain and sunshine
Where his scattered plumes and garments
Faded in the rain and sunshine

Day by day did Hiawatha
Go to wait and watch beside it
Kept the dark mould soft above it
Kept it clean from weeds and insects
Drove away with scoffs and shoutings
Kahgahgee the king of ravens

Till at length a small green feather
From the earth shot slowly upward
Then another and another
And before the Summer ended
Stood the maize in all its beauty
With its shining robes about it
And its long soft yellow tresses
And in rapture Hiawatha
Cried aloud It is Mondamin
Yes the friend of man Mondamin

Then he called to old Nokomis
And Iagoo the great boaster
Showed them where the maize was growing
Told them of his wondrous vision
Of his wrestling and his triumph
Of this new gift to the nations
Which should be their food forever

And still later when the Autumn
Changed the long green leaves to yellow
And the soft and juicy kernels
Grew like wampum hard and yellow
Then the ripened ears he gathered
Stripped the withered husks from off them
As he once had stripped the wrestler
Gave the first Feast of Mondamin
And made known unto the people
This new gift of the Great Spirit



 VI

 Hiawathas Friends

Two good friends had Hiawatha
Singled out from all the others
Bound to him in closest union
And to whom he gave the right hand
Of his heart in joy and sorrow
Chibiabos the musician
And the very strong man Kwasind

Straight between them ran the pathway
Never grew the grass upon it
Singing birds that utter falsehoods
Storytellers mischiefmakers
Found no eager ear to listen
Could not breed illwill between them
For they kept each others counsel
Spake with naked hearts together
Pondering much and much contriving
How the tribes of men might prosper

Most beloved by Hiawatha
Was the gentle Chibiabos
He the best of all musicians
He the sweetest of all singers
Beautiful and childlike was he
Brave as man is soft as woman
Pliant as a wand of willow
Stately as a deer with antlers

When he sang the village listened
All the warriors gathered round him
All the women came to hear him
Now he stirred their souls to passion
Now he melted them to pity

From the hollow reeds he fashioned
Flutes so musical and mellow
That the brook the Sebowisha
Ceased to murmur in the woodland
That the woodbirds ceased from singing
And the squirrel Adjidaumo
Ceased his chatter in the oaktree
And the rabbit the Wabasso
Sat upright to look and listen

Yes the brook the Sebowisha
Pausing said O Chibiabos
Teach my waves to flow in music
Softly as your words in singing

Yes the bluebird the Owaissa
Envious said O Chibiabos
Teach me tones as wild and wayward
Teach me songs as full of frenzy

Yes the robin the Opechee
Joyous said O Chibiabos
Teach me tones as sweet and tender
Teach me songs as full of gladness

And the whippoorwill Wawonaissa
Sobbing said O Chibiabos
Teach me tones as melancholy
Teach me songs as full of sadness

All the many sounds of nature
Borrowed sweetness from his singing
All the hearts of men were softened
By the pathos of his music
For he sang of peace and freedom
Sang of beauty love and longing
Sang of death and life undying
In the Islands of the Blessed
In the kingdom of Ponemah
In the land of the Hereafter

Very dear to Hiawatha
Was the gentle Chibiabos
He the best of all musicians
He the sweetest of all singers
For his gentleness he loved him
And the magic of his singing

Dear too unto Hiawatha
Was the very strong man Kwasind
He the strongest of all mortals
He the mightiest among many
For his very strength he loved him
For his strength allied to goodness

Idle in his youth was Kwasind
Very listless dull and dreamy
Never played with other children
Never fished and never hunted
Not like other children was he
But they saw that much he fasted
Much his Manito entreated
Much besought his Guardian Spirit

Lazy Kwasind said his mother
In my work you never help me
In the Summer you are roaming
Idly in the fields and forests
In the Winter you are cowering
Oer the firebrands in the wigwam
In the coldest days of Winter
I must break the ice for fishing
With my nets you never help me
At the door my nets are hanging
Dripping freezing with the water
Go and wring them Yenadizze
Go and dry them in the sunshine

Slowly from the ashes Kwasind
Rose but made no angry answer
From the lodge went forth in silence
Took the nets that hung together
Dripping freezing at the doorway
Like a wisp of straw he wrung them
Like a wisp of straw he broke them
Could not wring them without breaking
Such the strength was in his fingers

Lazy Kwasind said his father
In the hunt you never help me
Every bow you touch is broken
Snapped asunder every arrow
Yet come with me to the forest
You shall bring the hunting homeward

Down a narrow pass they wandered
Where a brooklet led them onward
Where the trail of deer and bison
Marked the soft mud on the margin
Till they found all further passage
Shut against them barred securely
By the trunks of trees uprooted
Lying lengthwise lying crosswise
And forbidding further passage

We must go back said the old man
Oer these logs we cannot clamber
Not a woodchuck could get through them
Not a squirrel clamber oer them
And straightway his pipe he lighted
And sat down to smoke and ponder
But before his pipe was finished
Lo the path was cleared before him
All the trunks had Kwasind lifted
To the right hand to the left hand
Shot the pinetrees swift as arrows
Hurled the cedars light as lances

Lazy Kwasind said the young men
As they sported in the meadow
Why stand idly looking at us
Leaning on the rock behind you
Come and wrestle with the others
Let us pitch the quoit together

Lazy Kwasind made no answer
To their challenge made no answer
Only rose and slowly turning
Seized the huge rock in his fingers
Tore it from its deep foundation
Poised it in the air a moment
Pitched it sheer into the river
Sheer into the swift Pauwating
Where it still is seen in Summer

Once as down that foaming river
Down the rapids of Pauwating
Kwasind sailed with his companions
In the stream he saw a beaver
Saw Ahmeek the King of Beavers
Struggling with the rushing currents
Rising sinking in the water

Without speaking without pausing
Kwasind leaped into the river
Plunged beneath the bubbling surface
Through the whirlpools chased the beaver
Followed him among the islands
Stayed so long beneath the water
That his terrified companions
Cried Alas goodby to Kwasind
We shall never more see Kwasind
But he reappeared triumphant
And upon his shining shoulders
Brought the beaver dead and dripping
Brought the King of all the Beavers

And these two as I have told you
Were the friends of Hiawatha
Chibiabos the musician
And the very strong man Kwasind
Long they lived in peace together
Spake with naked hearts together
Pondering much and much contriving
How the tribes of men might prosper



 VII

 Hiawathas Sailing

Give me of your bark O Birchtree
Of your yellow bark O Birchtree
Growing by the rushing river
Tall and stately in the valley
I a light canoe will build me
Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing
That shall float upon the river
Like a yellow leaf in Autumn
Like a yellow waterlily

Lay aside your cloak O Birchtree
Lay aside your whiteskin wrapper
For the Summertime is coming
And the sun is warm in heaven
And you need no whiteskin wrapper

Thus aloud cried Hiawatha
In the solitary forest
By the rushing Taquamenaw
When the birds were singing gayly
In the Moon of Leaves were singing
And the sun from sleep awaking
Started up and said Behold me
Gheezis the great Sun behold me

And the tree with all its branches
Rustled in the breeze of morning
Saying with a sigh of patience
Take my cloak O Hiawatha

With his knife the tree he girdled
Just beneath its lowest branches
Just above the roots he cut it
Till the sap came oozing outward
Down the trunk from top to bottom
Sheer he cleft the bark asunder
With a wooden wedge he raised it
Stripped it from the trunk unbroken

Give me of your boughs O Cedar
Of your strong and pliant branches
My canoe to make more steady
Make more strong and firm beneath me

Through the summit of the Cedar
Went a sound a cry of horror
Went a murmur of resistance
But it whispered bending downward
Take my boughs O Hiawatha

Down he hewed the boughs of cedar
Shaped them straightway to a framework
Like two bows he formed and shaped them
Like two bended bows together

Give me of your roots O Tamarack
Of your fibrous roots O Larchtree
My canoe to bind together
So to bind the ends together
That the water may not enter
That the river may not wet me

And the Larch with all its fibres
Shivered in the air of morning
Touched his forehead with its tassels
Slid with one long sigh of sorrow
Take them all O Hiawatha

From the earth he tore the fibres
Tore the tough roots of the Larchtree
Closely sewed the bark together
Bound it closely to the framework

Give me of your balm O Firtree
Of your balsam and your resin
So to close the seams together
That the water may not enter
That the river may not wet me

And the Firtree tall and sombre
Sobbed through all its robes of darkness
Rattled like a shore with pebbles
Answered wailing answered weeping
Take my balm O Hiawatha

And he took the tears of balsam
Took the resin of the Firtree
Smeared therewith each seam and fissure
Made each crevice safe from water

Give me of your quills O Hedgehog
All your quills O Kagh the Hedgehog
I will make a necklace of them
Make a girdle for my beauty
And two stars to deck her bosom

From a hollow tree the Hedgehog
With his sleepy eyes looked at him
Shot his shining quills like arrows
Saying with a drowsy murmur
Through the tangle of his whiskers
Take my quills O Hiawatha

From the ground the quills he gathered
All the little shining arrows
Stained them red and blue and yellow
With the juice of roots and berries
Into his canoe he wrought them
Round its waist a shining girdle
Round its bows a gleaming necklace
On its breast two stars resplendent

Thus the Birch Canoe was builded
In the valley by the river
In the bosom of the forest
And the forests life was in it
All its mystery and its magic
All the lightness of the birchtree
All the toughness of the cedar
All the larchs supple sinews
And it floated on the river
Like a yellow leaf in Autumn
Like a yellow waterlily

Paddles none had Hiawatha
Paddles none he had or needed
For his thoughts as paddles served him
And his wishes served to guide him
Swift or slow at will he glided
Veered to right or left at pleasure

Then he called aloud to Kwasind
To his friend the strong man Kwasind
Saying Help me clear this river
Of its sunken logs and sandbars

Straight into the river Kwasind
Plunged as if he were an otter
Dived as if he were a beaver
Stood up to his waist in water
To his armpits in the river
Swam and scouted in the river
Tugged at sunken logs and branches
With his hands he scooped the sandbars
With his feet the ooze and tangle

And thus sailed my Hiawatha
Down the rushing Taquamenaw
Sailed through all its bends and windings
Sailed through all its deeps and shallows
While his friend the strong man Kwasind
Swam the deeps the shallows waded

Up and down the river went they
In and out among its islands
Cleared its bed of root and sandbar
Dragged the dead trees from its channel
Made its passage safe and certain
Made a pathway for the people
From its springs among the mountains
To the waters of Pauwating
To the bay of Taquamenaw



 VIII

 Hiawathas Fishing

Forth upon the Gitche Gumee
On the shining BigSeaWater
With his fishingline of cedar
Of the twisted bark of cedar
Forth to catch the sturgeon Nahma
MisheNahma King of Fishes
In his birch canoe exulting
All alone went Hiawatha

Through the clear transparent water
He could see the fishes swimming
Far down in the depths below him
See the yellow perch the Sahwa
Like a sunbeam in the water
See the Shawgashee the crawfish
Like a spider on the bottom
On the white and sandy bottom

At the stern sat Hiawatha
With his fishingline of cedar
In his plumes the breeze of morning
Played as in the hemlock branches
On the bows with tail erected
Sat the squirrel Adjidaumo
In his fur the breeze of morning
Played as in the prairie grasses

On the white sand of the bottom
Lay the monster MisheNahma
Lay the sturgeon King of Fishes
Through his gills he breathed the water
With his fins he fanned and winnowed
With his tail he swept the sandfloor

There he lay in all his armor
On each side a shield to guard him
Plates of bone upon his forehead
Down his sides and back and shoulders
Plates of bone with spines projecting
Painted was he with his warpaints
Stripes of yellow red and azure
Spots of brown and spots of sable
And he lay there on the bottom
Fanning with his fins of purple
As above him Hiawatha
In his birch canoe came sailing
With his fishingline of cedar

Take my bait cried Hiawatha
Dawn into the depths beneath him
Take my bait O Sturgeon Nahma
Come up from below the water
Let us see which is the stronger
And he dropped his line of cedar
Through the clear transparent water
Waited vainly for an answer
Long sat waiting for an answer
And repeating loud and louder
Take my bait O King of Fishes

Quiet lay the sturgeon Nahma
Fanning slowly in the water
Looking up at Hiawatha
Listening to his call and clamor
His unnecessary tumult
Till he wearied of the shouting
And he said to the Kenozha
To the pike the Maskenozha
Take the bait of this rude fellow
Break the line of Hiawatha

In his fingers Hiawatha
Felt the loose line jerk and tighten
As he drew it in it tugged so
That the birch canoe stood endwise
Like a birch log in the water
With the squirrel Adjidaumo
Perched and frisking on the summit

Full of scorn was Hiawatha
When he saw the fish rise upward
Saw the pike the Maskenozha
Coming nearer nearer to him
And he shouted through the water
Esa esa shame upon you
You are but the pike Kenozha
You are not the fish I wanted
You are not the King of Fishes

Reeling downward to the bottom
Sank the pike in great confusion
And the mighty sturgeon Nahma
Said to Ugudwash the sunfish
To the bream with scales of crimson
Take the bait of this great boaster
Break the line of Hiawatha

Slowly upward wavering gleaming
Rose the Ugudwash the sunfish
Seized the line of Hiawatha
Swung with all his weight upon it
Made a whirlpool in the water
Whirled the birch canoe in circles
Round and round in gurgling eddies
Till the circles in the water
Reached the faroff sandy beaches
Till the waterflags and rushes
Nodded on the distant margins

But when Hiawatha saw him
Slowly rising through the water
Lifting up his disk refulgent
Loud he shouted in derision
Esa esa shame upon you
You are Ugudwash the sunfish
You are not the fish I wanted
You are not the King of Fishes

Slowly downward wavering gleaming
Sank the Ugudwash the sunfish
And again the sturgeon Nahma
Heard the shout of Hiawatha
Heard his challenge of defiance
The unnecessary tumult
Ringing far across the water

From the white sand of the bottom
Up he rose with angry gesture
Quivering in each nerve and fibre
Clashing all his plates of armor
Gleaming bright with all his warpaint
In his wrath he darted upward
Flashing leaped into the sunshine
Opened his great jaws and swallowed
Both canoe and Hiawatha

Down into that darksome cavern
Plunged the headlong Hiawatha
As a log on some black river
Shoots and plunges down the rapids
Found himself in utter darkness
Groped about in helpless wonder
Till he felt a great heart beating
Throbbing in that utter darkness

And he smote it in his anger
With his fist the heart of Nahma
Felt the mighty King of Fishes
Shudder through each nerve and fibre
Heard the water gurgle round him
As he leaped and staggered through it
Sick at heart and faint and weary

Crosswise then did Hiawatha
Drag his birchcanoe for safety
Lest from out the jaws of Nahma
In the turmoil and confusion
Forth he might be hurled and perish
And the squirrel Adjidaumo
Frisked and chatted very gayly
Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha
Till the labor was completed

Then said Hiawatha to him
O my little friend the squirrel
Bravely have you toiled to help me
Take the thanks of Hiawatha
And the name which now he gives you
For hereafter and forever
Boys shall call you Adjidaumo
Tailinair the boys shall call you

And again the sturgeon Nahma
Gasped and quivered in the water
Then was still and drifted landward
Till he grated on the pebbles
Till the listening Hiawatha
Heard him grate upon the margin
Felt him strand upon the pebbles
Knew that Nahma King of Fishes
Lay there dead upon the margin

Then he heard a clang and flapping
As of many wings assembling
Heard a screaming and confusion
As of birds of prey contending
Saw a gleam of light above him
Shining through the ribs of Nahma
Saw the glittering eyes of seagulls
Of Kayoshk the seagulls peering
Gazing at him through the opening
Heard them saying to each other
T is our brother Hiawatha

And he shouted from below them
Cried exulting from the caverns
O ye seagulls O my brothers
I have slain the sturgeon Nahma
Make the rifts a little larger
With your claws the openings widen
Set me free from this dark prison
And henceforward and forever
Men shall speak of your achievements
Calling you Kayoshk the seagulls
Yes Kayoshk the Noble Scratchers

And the wild and clamorous seagulls
Toiled with beak and claws together
Made the rifts and openings wider
In the mighty ribs of Nahma
And from peril and from prison
From the body of the sturgeon
From the peril of the water
They released my Hiawatha

He was standing near his wigwam
On the margin of the water
And he called to old Nokomis
Called and beckoned to Nokomis
Pointed to the sturgeon Nahma
Lying lifeless on the pebbles
With the seagulls feeding on him

I have slain the MisheNahma
Slain the King of Fishes said he
Look the seagulls feed upon him
Yes my friends Kayoshk the seagulls
Drive them not away Nokomis
They have saved me from great peril
In the body of the sturgeon
Wait until their meal is ended
Till their craws are full with feasting
Till they homeward fly at sunset
To their nests among the marshes
Then bring all your pots and kettles
And make oil for us in Winter

And she waited till the sun set
Till the pallid moon the Nightsun
Rose above the tranquil water
Till Kayoshk the sated seagulls
From their banquet rose with clamor
And across the fiery sunset
Winged their way to faroff islands
To their nests among the rushes

To his sleep went Hiawatha
And Nokomis to her labor
Toiling patient in the moonlight
Till the sun and moon changed places
Till the sky was red with sunrise
And Kayoshk the hungry seagulls
Came back from the reedy islands
Clamorous for their morning banquet

Three whole days and nights alternate
Old Nokomis and the seagulls
Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma
Till the waves washed through the ribbones
Till the seagulls came no longer
And upon the sands lay nothing
But the skeleton of Nahma



 IX

Hiawatha and the PearlFeather

On the shores of Gitche Gumee
Of the shining BigSeaWater
Stood Nokomis the old woman
Pointing with her finger westward
Oer the water pointing westward
To the purple clouds of sunset

Fiercely the red sun descending
Burned his way along the heavens
Set the sky on fire behind him
As warparties when retreating
Burn the prairies on their wartrail
And the moon the Nightsun eastward
Suddenly starting from his ambush
Followed fast those bloody footprints
Followed in that fiery wartrail
With its glare upon his features

And Nokomis the old woman
Pointing with her finger westward
Spake these words to Hiawatha
Yonder dwells the great PearlFeather
Megissogwon the Magician
Manito of Wealth and Wampum
Guarded by his fiery serpents
Guarded by the black pitchwater
You can see his fiery serpents
The Kenabeek the great serpents
Coiling playing in the water
You can see the black pitchwater
Stretching far away beyond them
To the purple clouds of sunset

He it was who slew my father
By his wicked wiles and cunning
When he from the moon descended
When he came on earth to seek me
He the mightiest of Magicians
Sends the fever from the marshes
Sends the pestilential vapors
Sends the poisonous exhalations
Sends the white fog from the fenlands
Sends disease and death among us

Take your bow O Hiawatha
Take your arrows jasperheaded
Take your warclub Puggawaugun
And your mittens Minjekahwun
And your birchcanoe for sailing
And the oil of MisheNahma
So to smear its sides that swiftly
You may pass the black pitchwater
Slay this merciless magician
Save the people from the fever
That he breathes across the fenlands
And avenge my fathers murder

Straightway then my Hiawatha
Armed himself with all his wargear
Launched his birchcanoe for sailing
With his palm its sides he patted
Said with glee Cheemaun my darling
O my Birchcanoe leap forward
Where you see the fiery serpents
Where you see the black pitchwater

Forward leaped Cheemaun exulting
And the noble Hiawatha
Sang his warsong wild and woful
And above him the wareagle
The Keneu the great wareagle
Master of all fowls with feathers
Screamed and hurtled through the heavens

Soon he reached the fiery serpents
The Kenabeek the great serpents
Lying huge upon the water
Sparkling rippling in the water
Lying coiled across the passage
With their blazing crests uplifted
Breathing fiery fogs and vapors
So that none could pass beyond them

But the fearless Hiawatha
Cried aloud and spake in this wise
Let me pass my way Kenabeek
Let me go upon my journey
And they answered hissing fiercely
With their fiery breath made answer
Back go back O Shaugodaya
Back to old Nokomis Faintheart

Then the angry Hiawatha
Raised his mighty bow of ashtree
Seized his arrows jasperheaded
Shot them fast among the serpents
Every twanging of the bowstring
Was a warcry and a deathcry
Every whizzing of an arrow
Was a deathsong of Kenabeek

Weltering in the bloody water
Dead lay all the fiery serpents
And among them Hiawatha
Harmless sailed and cried exulting
Onward O Cheemaun my darling
Onward to the black pitchwater

Then he took the oil of Nahma
And the bows and sides anointed
Smeared them well with oil that swiftly
He might pass the black pitchwater

All night long he sailed upon it
Sailed upon that sluggish water
Covered with its mould of ages
Black with rotting waterrushes
Rank with flags and leaves of lilies
Stagnant lifeless dreary dismal
Lighted by the shimmering moonlight
And by willothewisps illumined
Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled
In their weary nightencampments

All the air was white with moonlight
All the water black with shadow
And around him the Suggema
The mosquito sang his warsong
And the fireflies Wahwahtaysee
Waved their torches to mislead him
And the bullfrog the Dahinda
Thrust his head into the moonlight
Fixed his yellow eyes upon him
Sobbed and sank beneath the surface
And anon a thousand whistles
Answered over all the fenlands
And the heron the Shuhshuhgah
Far off on the reedy margin
Heralded the heros coming

Westward thus fared Hiawatha
Toward the realm of Megissogwon
Toward the land of the PearlFeather
Till the level moon stared at him
In his face stared pale and haggard
Till the sun was hot behind him
Till it burned upon his shoulders
And before him on the upland
He could see the Shining Wigwam
Of the Manito of Wampum
Of the mightiest of Magicians

Then once more Cheemaun he patted
To his birchcanoe said Onward
And it stirred in all its fibres
And with one great bound of triumph
Leaped across the waterlilies
Leaped through tangled flags and rushes
And upon the beach beyond them
Dryshod landed Hiawatha

Straight he took his bow of ashtree
On the sand one end he rested
With his knee he pressed the middle
Stretched the faithful bowstring tighter
Took an arrow jasperheaded
Shot it at the Shining Wigwam
Sent it singing as a herald
As a bearer of his message
Of his challenge loud and lofty
Come forth from your lodge PearlFeather
Hiawatha waits your coming

Straightway from the Shining Wigwam
Came the mighty Megissogwon
Tall of stature broad of shoulder
Dark and terrible in aspect
Clad from head to foot in wampum
Armed with all his warlike weapons
Painted like the sky of morning
Streaked with crimson blue and yellow
Crested with great eaglefeathers
Streaming upward streaming outward

Well I know you Hiawatha
Cried he in a voice of thunder
In a tone of loud derision
Hasten back O Shaugodaya
Hasten back among the women
Back to old Nokomis Faintheart
I will slay you as you stand there
As of old I slew her father

But my Hiawatha answered
Nothing daunted fearing nothing
Big words do not smite like warclubs
Boastful breath is not a bowstring
Taunts are not so sharp as arrows
Deeds are better things than words are
Actions mightier than boastings

Then began the greatest battle
That the sun had ever looked on
That the warbirds ever witnessed
All a Summers day it lasted
From the sunrise to the sunset
For the shafts of Hiawatha
Harmless hit the shirt of wampum
Harmless fell the blows he dealt it
With his mittens Minjekahwun
Harmless fell the heavy warclub
It could dash the rocks asunder
But it could not break the meshes
Of that magic shirt of wampum

Till at sunset Hiawatha
Leaning on his bow of ashtree
Wounded weary and desponding
With his mighty warclub broken
With his mittens torn and tattered
And three useless arrows only
Paused to rest beneath a pinetree
From whose branches trailed the mosses
And whose trunk was coated over
With the Deadmans Moccasinleather
With the fungus white and yellow

Suddenly from the boughs above him
Sang the Mama the woodpecker
Aim your arrows Hiawatha
At the head of Megissogwon
Strike the tuft of hair upon it
At their roots the long black tresses
There alone can he be wounded

Winged with feathers tipped with jasper
Swift flew Hiawathas arrow
Just as Megissogwon stooping
Raised a heavy stone to throw it
Full upon the crown it struck him
At the roots of his long tresses
And he reeled and staggered forward
Plunging like a wounded bison
Yes like Pezhekee the bison
When the snow is on the prairie

Swifter flew the second arrow
In the pathway of the other
Piercing deeper than the other
Wounding sorer than the other
And the knees of Megissogwon
Shook like windy reeds beneath him
Bent and trembled like the rushes

But the third and latest arrow
Swiftest flew and wounded sorest
And the mighty Megissogwon
Saw the fiery eyes of Pauguk
Saw the eyes of Death glare at him
Heard his voice call in the darkness
At the feet of Hiawatha
Lifeless lay the great PearlFeather
Lay the mightiest of Magicians

Then the grateful Hiawatha
Called the Mama the woodpecker
From his perch among the branches
Of the melancholy pinetree
And in honor of his service
Stained with blood the tuft of feathers
On the little head of Mama
Even to this day he wears it
Wears the tuft of crimson feathers
As a symbol of his service

Then he stripped the shirt of wampum
From the back of Megissogwon
As a trophy of the battle
As a signal of his conquest
On the shore he left the body
Half on land and half in water
In the sand his feet were buried
And his face was in the water
And above him wheeled and clamored
The Keneu the great wareagle
Sailing round in narrower circles
Hovering nearer nearer nearer

From the wigwam Hiawatha
Bore the wealth of Megissogwon
All his wealth of skins and wampum
Furs of bison and of beaver
Furs of sable and of ermine
Wampum belts and strings and pouches
Quivers wrought with beads of wampum
Filled with arrows silverheaded

Homeward then he sailed exulting
Homeward through the black pitchwater
Homeward through the weltering serpents
With the trophies of the battle
With a shout and song of triumph

On the shore stood old Nokomis
On the shore stood Chibiabos
And the very strong man Kwasind
Waiting for the heros coming
Listening to his songs of triumph
And the people of the village
Welcomed him with songs and dances
Made a joyous feast and shouted
Honor be to Hiawatha
He has slain the great PearlFeather
Slain the mightiest of Magicians
Him who sent the fiery fever
Sent the white fog from the fenlands
Sent disease and death among us

Ever dear to Hiawatha
Was the memory of Mama
And in token of his friendship
As a mark of his remembrance
He adorned and decked his pipestem
With the crimson tuft of feathers
With the bloodred crest of Mama
But the wealth of Megissogwon
All the trophies of the battle
He divided with his people
Shared it equally among them

 Hiawathas Wooing

As unto the bow the cord is
So unto the man is woman
Though she bends him she obeys him
Though she draws him yet she follows
Useless each without the other

Thus the youthful Hiawatha
Said within himself and pondered
Much perplexed by various feelings
Listless longing hoping fearing
Dreaming still of Minnehaha
Of the lovely Laughing Water
In the land of the Dacotahs

Wed a maiden of your people
Warning said the old Nokomis
Go not eastward go not westward
For a stranger whom we know not
Like a fire upon the hearthstone
Is a neighbors homely daughter
Like the starlight or the moonlight
Is the handsomest of strangers

Thus dissuading spake Nokomis
And my Hiawatha answered
Only this Dear old Nokomis
Very pleasant is the firelight
But I like the starlight better
Better do I like the moonlight

Gravely then said old Nokomis
Bring not here an idle maiden
Bring not here a useless woman
Hands unskilful feet unwilling
Bring a wife with nimble fingers
Heart and hand that move together
Feet that run on willing errands

Smiling answered Hiawatha
In the land of the Dacotahs
Lives the Arrowmakers daughter
Minnehaha Laughing Water
Handsomest of all the women
I will bring her to your wigwam
She shall run upon your errands
Be your starlight moonlight firelight
Be the sunlight of my people

Still dissuading said Nokomis
Bring not to my lodge a stranger
From the land of the Dacotahs
Very fierce are the Dacotahs
Often is there war between us
There are feuds yet unforgotten
Wounds that ache and still may open

Laughing answered Hiawatha
For that reason if no other
Would I wed the fair Dacotah
That our tribes might be united
That old feuds might be forgotten
And old wounds be healed forever

Thus departed Hiawatha
To the land of the Dacotahs
To the land of handsome women
Striding over moor and meadow
Through interminable forests
Through uninterrupted silence

With his moccasins of magic
At each stride a mile he measured
Yet the way seemed long before him
And his heart outran his footsteps
And he journeyed without resting
Till he heard the cataracts laughter
Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
Calling to him through the silence
Pleasant is the sound he murmured
Pleasant is the voice that calls me

On the outskirts of the forests
Twixt the shadow and the sunshine
Herds of fallow deer were feeding
But they saw not Hiawatha
To his bow he whispered Fail not
To his arrow whispered Swerve not
Sent it singing on its errand
To the red heart of the roebuck
Threw the deer across his shoulder
And sped forward without pausing

At the doorway of his wigwam
Sat the ancient Arrowmaker
In the land of the Dacotahs
Making arrowheads of jasper
Arrowheads of chalcedony
At his side in all her beauty
Sat the lovely Minnehaha
Sat his daughter Laughing Water
Plaiting mats of flags and rushes
Of the past the old mans thoughts were
And the maidens of the future

He was thinking as he sat there
Of the days when with such arrows
He had struck the deer and bison
On the Muskoday the meadow
Shot the wild goose flying southward
On the wing the clamorous Wawa
Thinking of the great warparties
How they came to buy his arrows
Could not fight without his arrows
Ah no more such noble warriors
Could be found on earth as they were
Now the men were all like women
Only used their tongues for weapons

She was thinking of a hunter
From another tribe and country
Young and tall and very handsome
Who one morning in the Springtime
Came to buy her fathers arrows
Sat and rested in the wigwam
Lingered long about the doorway
Looking back as he departed
She had heard her father praise him
Praise his courage and his wisdom
Would he come again for arrows
To the Falls of Minnehaha
On the mat her hands lay idle
And her eyes were very dreamy

Through their thoughts they heard a footstep
Heard a rustling in the branches
And with glowing cheek and forehead
With the deer upon his shoulders
Suddenly from out the woodlands
Hiawatha stood before them

Straight the ancient Arrowmaker
Looked up gravely from his labor
Laid aside the unfinished arrow
Bade him enter at the doorway
Saying as he rose to meet him
Hiawatha you are welcome

At the feet of Laughing Water
Hiawatha laid his burden
Threw the red deer from his shoulders
And the maiden looked up at him
Looked up from her mat of rushes
Said with gentle look and accent
You are welcome Hiawatha

Very spacious was the wigwam
Made of deerskins dressed and whitened
With the Gods of the Dacotahs
Drawn and painted on its curtains
And so tall the doorway hardly
Hiawatha stooped to enter
Hardly touched his eaglefeathers
As he entered at the doorway

Then uprose the Laughing Water
From the ground fair Minnehaha
Laid aside her mat unfinished
Brought forth food and set before them
Water brought them from the brooklet
Gave them food in earthen vessels
Gave them drink in bowls of basswood
Listened while the guest was speaking
Listened while her father answered
But not once her lips she opened
Not a single word she uttered

Yes as in a dream she listened
To the words of Hiawatha
As he talked of old Nokomis
Who had nursed him in his childhood
As he told of his companions
Chibiabos the musician
And the very strong man Kwasind
And of happiness and plenty
In the land of the Ojibways
In the pleasant land and peaceful

After many years of warfare
Many years of strife and bloodshed
There is peace between the Ojibways
And the tribe of the Dacotahs
Thus continued Hiawatha
And then added speaking slowly
That this peace may last forever
And our hands be clasped more closely
And our hearts be more united
Give me as my wife this maiden
Minnehaha Laughing Water
Loveliest of Dacotah women

And the ancient Arrowmaker
Paused a moment ere he answered
Smoked a little while in silence
Looked at Hiawatha proudly
Fondly looked at Laughing Water
And made answer very gravely
Yes if Minnehaha wishes
Let your heart speak Minnehaha

And the lovely Laughing Water
Seemed more lovely as she stood there
Neither willing nor reluctant
As she went to Hiawatha
Softly took the seat beside him
While she said and blushed to say it
I will follow you my husband

This was Hiawathas wooing
Thus it was he won the daughter
Of the ancient Arrowmaker
In the land of the Dacotahs

From the wigwam he departed
Leading with him Laughing Water
Hand in hand they went together
Through the woodland and the meadow
Left the old man standing lonely
At the doorway of his wigwam
Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
Calling to them from the distance
Crying to them from afar off
Fare thee well O Minnehaha

And the ancient Arrowmaker
Turned again unto his labor
Sat down by his sunny doorway
Murmuring to himself and saying
Thus it is our daughters leave us
Those we love and those who love us
Just when they have learned to help us
When we are old and lean upon them
Comes a youth with flaunting feathers
With his flute of reeds a stranger
Wanders piping through the village
Beckons to the fairest maiden
And she follows where he leads her
Leaving all things for the stranger

Pleasant was the journey homeward
Through interminable forests
Over meadow over mountain
Over river hill and hollow
Short it seemed to Hiawatha
Though they journeyed very slowly
Though his pace he checked and slackened
To the steps of Laughing Water

Over wide and rushing rivers
In his arms he bore the maiden
Light he thought her as a feather
As the plume upon his headgear
Cleared the tangled pathway for her
Bent aside the swaying branches
Made at night a lodge of branches
And a bed with boughs of hemlock
And a fire before the doorway
With the dry cones of the pinetree

All the travelling winds went with them
Oer the meadows through the forest
All the stars of night looked at them
Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber
From his ambush in the oaktree
Peeped the squirrel Adjidaumo
Watched with eager eyes the lovers
And the rabbit the Wabasso
Scampered from the path before them
Peering peeping from his burrow
Sat erect upon his haunches
Watched with curious eyes the lovers

Pleasant was the journey homeward
All the birds sang loud and sweetly
Songs of happiness and heartsease
Sang the bluebird the Owaissa
Happy are you Hiawatha
Having such a wife to love you
Sang the robin the Opechee
Happy are you Laughing Water
Having such a noble husband

From the sky the sun benignant
Looked upon them through the branches
Saying to them O my children
Love is sunshine hate is shadow
Life is checkered shade and sunshine
Rule by love O Hiawatha

From the sky the moon looked at them
Filled the lodge with mystic splendors
Whispered to them O my children
Day is restless night is quiet
Man imperious woman feeble
Half is mine although I follow
Rule by patience Laughing Water

Thus it was they journeyed homeward
Thus it was that Hiawatha
To the lodge of old Nokomis
Brought the moonlight starlight firelight
Brought the sunshine of his people
Minnehaha Laughing Water
Handsomest of all the women
In the land of the Dacotahs
In the land of handsome women

 XI

 Hiawathas WeddingFeast

You shall hear how PauPukKeewis
How the handsome Yenadizze
Danced at Hiawathas wedding
How the gentle Chibiabos
He the sweetest of musicians
Sang his songs of love and longing
How Iagoo the great boaster
He the marvellous storyteller
Told his tales of strange adventure
That the feast might be more joyous
That the time might pass more gayly
And the guests be more contented

Sumptuous was the feast Nokomis
Made at Hiawathas wedding
All the bowls were made of basswood
White and polished very smoothly
All the spoons of horn of bison
Black and polished very smoothly

She had sent through all the village
Messengers with wands of willow
As a sign of invitation
As a token of the feasting
And the wedding guests assembled
Clad in all their richest raiment
Robes of fur and belts of wampum
Splendid with their paint and plumage
Beautiful with beads and tassels

First they ate the sturgeon Nahma
And the pike the Maskenozha
Caught and cooked by old Nokomis
Then on pemican they feasted
Pemican and buffalo marrow
Haunch of deer and hump of bison
Yellow cakes of the Mondamin
And the wild rice of the river

But the gracious Hiawatha
And the lovely Laughing Water
And the careful old Nokomis
Tasted not the food before them
Only waited on the others
Only served their guests in silence

And when all the guests had finished
Old Nokomis brisk and busy
From an ample pouch of otter
Filled the redstone pipes for smoking
With tobacco from the Southland
Mixed with bark of the red willow
And with herbs and leaves of fragrance

Then she said O PauPukKeewis
Dance for us your merry dances
Dance the Beggars Dance to please us
That the feast may be more joyous
That the time may pass more gayly
And our guests be more contented

Then the handsome PauPukKeewis
He the idle Yenadizze
He the merry mischiefmaker
Whom the people called the StormFool
Rose among the guests assembled

Skilled was he in sports and pastimes
In the merry dance of snowshoes
In the play of quoits and ballplay
Skilled was he in games of hazard
In all games of skill and hazard
Pugasaing the Bowl and Counters
Kuntassoo the Game of Plumstones
Though the warriors called him FaintHeart
Called him coward Shaugodaya
Idler gambler Yenadizze
Little heeded he their jesting
Little cared he for their insults
For the women and the maidens
Loved the handsome PauPukKeewis

He was dressed in shirt of doeskin
White and soft and fringed with ermine
All inwrought with beads of wampum
He was dressed in deerskin leggings
Fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine
And in moccasins of buckskin
Thick with quills and beads embroidered
On his head were plumes of swans down
On his heels were tails of foxes
In one hand a fan of feathers
And a pipe was in the other

Barred with streaks of red and yellow
Streaks of blue and bright vermilion
Shone the face of PauPukKeewis
From his forehead fell his tresses
Smooth and parted like a womans
Shining bright with oil and plaited
Hung with braids of scented grasses
As among the guests assembled
To the sound of flutes and singing
To the sound of drums and voices
Rose the handsome PauPukKeewis
And began his mystic dances

First he danced a solemn measure
Very slow in step and gesture
In and out among the pinetrees
Through the shadows and the sunshine
Treading softly like a panther
Then more swiftly and still swifter
Whirling spinning round in circles
Leaping oer the guests assembled
Eddying round and round the wigwam
Till the leaves went whirling with him
Till the dust and wind together
Swept in eddies round about him

Then along the sandy margin
Of the lake the BigSeaWater
On he sped with frenzied gestures
Stamped upon the sand and tossed it
Wildly in the air around him
Till the wind became a whirlwind
Till the sand was blown and sifted
Like great snowdrifts oer the landscape
Heaping all the shores with Sand Dunes
Sand Hills of the Nagow Wudjoo

Thus the merry PauPukKeewis
Danced his Beggars Dance to please them
And returning sat down laughing
There among the guests assembled
Sat and fanned himself serenely
With his fan of turkeyfeathers

Then they said to Chibiabos
To the friend of Hiawatha
To the sweetest of all singers
To the best of all musicians
Sing to us O Chibiabos
Songs of love and songs of longing
That the feast may be more joyous
That the time may pass more gayly
And our guests be more contented

And the gentle Chibiabos
Sang in accents sweet and tender
Sang in tones of deep emotion
Songs of love and songs of longing
Looking still at Hiawatha
Looking at fair Laughing Water
Sang he softly sang in this wise

Onaway Awake beloved
Thou the wildflower of the forest
Thou the wildbird of the prairie
Thou with eyes so soft and fawnlike

If thou only lookest at me
I am happy I am happy
As the lilies of the prairie
When they feel the dew upon them

Sweet thy breath is as the fragrance
Of the wildflowers in the morning
As their fragrance is at evening
In the Moon when leaves are falling

Does not all the blood within me
Leap to meet thee leap to meet thee
As the springs to meet the sunshine
In the Moon when nights are brightest

Onaway my heart sings to thee
Sings with joy when thou art near me
As the sighing singing branches
In the pleasant Moon of Strawberries

When thou art not pleased beloved
Then my heart is sad and darkened
As the shining river darkens
When the clouds drop shadows on it

When thou smilest my beloved
Then my troubled heart is brightened
As in sunshine gleam the ripples
That the cold wind makes in rivers

Smiles the earth and smile the waters
Smile the cloudless skies above us
But I lose the way of smiling
When thou art no longer near me

I myself myself behold me
Blood of my beating heart behold me
Oh awake awake beloved
Onaway awake beloved

Thus the gentle Chibiabos
Sang his song of love and longing
And Iagoo the great boaster
He the marvellous storyteller
He the friend of old Nokomis
Jealous of the sweet musician
Jealous of the applause they gave him
Saw in all the eyes around him
Saw in all their looks and gestures
That the wedding guests assembled
Longed to hear his pleasant stories
His immeasurable falsehoods

Very boastful was Iagoo
Never heard he an adventure
But himself had met a greater
Never any deed of daring
But himself had done a bolder
Never any marvellous story
But himself could tell a stranger

Would you listen to his boasting
Would you only give him credence
No one ever shot an arrow
Half so far and high as he had
Ever caught so many fishes
Ever killed so many reindeer
Ever trapped so many beaver

None could run so fast as he could
None could dive so deep as he could
None could swim so far as he could
None had made so many journeys
None had seen so many wonders
As this wonderful Iagoo
As this marvellous storyteller
Thus his name became a byword
And a jest among the people
And wheneer a boastful hunter
Praised his own address too highly
Or a warrior home returning
Talked too much of his achievements
All his hearers cried Iagoo
Heres Iagoo come among us

He it was who carved the cradle
Of the little Hiawatha
Carved its framework out of linden
Bound it strong with reindeer sinews
He it was who taught him later
How to make his bows and arrows
How to make the bows of ashtree
And the arrows of the oaktree
So among the guests assembled
At my Hiawathas wedding
Sat Iagoo old and ugly
Sat the marvellous storyteller

And they said O good Iagoo
Tell us now a tale of wonder
Tell us of some strange adventure
That the feast may be more joyous
That the time may pass more gayly
And our guests be more contented

And Iagoo answered straightway
You shall hear a tale of wonder
You shall hear the strange adventures
Of Osseo the Magician
From the Evening Star descending



 XII

 The Son of the Evening Star

Can it be the sun descending
Oer the level plain of water
Or the Red Swan floating flying
Wounded by the magic arrow
Staining all the waves with crimson
With the crimson of its lifeblood
Filling all the air with splendor
With the splendor of its plumage

Yes it is the sun descending
Sinking down into the water
All the sky is stained with purple
All the water flushed with crimson
No it is the Red Swan floating
Diving down beneath the water
To the sky its wings are lifted
With its blood the waves are reddened

Over it the Star of Evening
Melts and trembles through the purple
Hangs suspended in the twilight
No it is a bead of wampum
On the robes of the Great Spirit
As he passes through the twilight
Walks in silence through the heavens

This with joy beheld Iagoo
And he said in haste Behold it
See the sacred Star of Evening
You shall hear a tale of wonder
Hear the story of Osseo
Son of the Evening Star Osseo

Once in days no more remembered
Ages nearer the beginning
When the heavens were closer to us
And the Gods were more familiar
In the Northland lived a hunter
With ten young and comely daughters
Tall and lithe as wands of willow
Only Oweenee the youngest
She the wilful and the wayward
She the silent dreamy maiden
Was the fairest of the sisters

All these women married warriors
Married brave and haughty husbands
Only Oweenee the youngest
Laughed and flouted all her lovers
All her young and handsome suitors
And then married old Osseo
Old Osseo poor and ugly
Broken with age and weak with coughing
Always coughing like a squirrel

Ah but beautiful within him
Was the spirit of Osseo
From the Evening Star descended
Star of Evening Star of Woman
Star of tenderness and passion
All its fire was in his bosom
All its beauty in his spirit
All its mystery in his being
All its splendor in his language

And her lovers the rejected
Handsome men with belts of wampum
Handsome men with paint and feathers
Pointed at her in derision
Followed her with jest and laughter
But she said I care not for you
Care not for your belts of wampum
Care not for your paint and feathers
Care not for your jests and laughter
I am happy with Osseo

Once to some great feast invited
Through the damp and dusk of evening
Walked together the ten sisters
Walked together with their husbands
Slowly followed old Osseo
With fair Oweenee beside him
All the others chatted gayly
These two only walked in silence

At the western sky Osseo
Gazed intent as if imploring
Often stopped and gazed imploring
At the trembling Star of Evening
At the tender Star of Woman
And they heard him murmur softly
Ah showain nemeshin Nosa
Pity pity me my father

Listen said the eldest sister
He is praying to his father
What a pity that the old man
Does not stumble in the pathway
Does not break his neck by falling
And they laughed till all the forest
Rang with their unseemly laughter

On their pathway through the woodlands
Lay an oak by storms uprooted
Lay the great trunk of an oaktree
Buried half in leaves and mosses
Mouldering crumbling huge and hollow
And Osseo when he saw it
Gave a shout a cry of anguish
Leaped into its yawning cavern
At one end went in an old man
Wasted wrinkled old and ugly
From the other came a young man
Tall and straight and strong and handsome

Thus Osseo was transfigured
Thus restored to youth and beauty
But alas for good Osseo
And for Oweenee the faithful
Strangely too was she transfigured
Changed into a weak old woman
With a staff she tottered onward
Wasted wrinkled old and ugly
And the sisters and their husbands
Laughed until the echoing forest
Rang with their unseemly laughter

But Osseo turned not from her
Walked with slower step beside her
Took her hand as brown and withered
As an oakleaf is in Winter
Called her sweetheart Nenemoosha
Soothed her with soft words of kindness
Till they reached the lodge of feasting
Till they sat down in the wigwam
Sacred to the Star of Evening
To the tender Star of Woman

Wrapt in visions lost in dreaming
At the banquet sat Osseo
All were merry all were happy
All were joyous but Osseo
Neither food nor drink he tasted
Neither did he speak nor listen
But as one bewildered sat he
Looking dreamily and sadly
First at Oweenee then upward
At the gleaming sky above them

Then a voice was heard a whisper
Coming from the starry distance
Coming from the empty vastness
Low and musical and tender
And the voice said O Osseo
O my son my best beloved
Broken are the spells that bound you
All the charms of the magicians
All the magic powers of evil
Come to me ascend Osseo

Taste the food that stands before you
It is blessed and enchanted
It has magic virtues in it
It will change you to a spirit
All your bowls and all your kettles
Shall be wood and clay no longer
But the bowls be changed to wampum
And the kettles shall be silver
They shall shine like shells of scarlet
Like the fire shall gleam and glimmer

And the women shall no longer
Bear the dreary doom of labor
But be changed to birds and glisten
With the beauty of the starlight
Painted with the dusky splendors
Of the skies and clouds of evening

What Osseo heard as whispers
What as words he comprehended
Was but music to the others
Music as of birds afar off
Of the whippoorwill afar off
Of the lonely Wawonaissa
Singing in the darksome forest

Then the lodge began to tremble
Straight began to shake and tremble
And they felt it rising rising
Slowly through the air ascending
From the darkness of the treetops
Forth into the dewy starlight
Till it passed the topmost branches
And behold the wooden dishes
All were changed to shells of scarlet
And behold the earthen kettles
All were changed to bowls of silver
And the roofpoles of the wigwam
Were as glittering rods of silver
And the roof of bark upon them
As the shining shards of beetles

Then Osseo gazed around him
And he saw the nine fair sisters
All the sisters and their husbands
Changed to birds of various plumage
Some were jays and some were magpies
Others thrushes others blackbirds
And they hopped and sang and twittered
Perked and fluttered all their feathers
Strutted in their shining plumage
And their tails like fans unfolded

Only Oweenee the youngest
Was not changed but sat in silence
Wasted wrinkled old and ugly
Looking sadly at the others
Till Osseo gazing upward
Gave another cry of anguish
Such a cry as he had uttered
By the oaktree in the forest

Then returned her youth and beauty
And her soiled and tattered garments
Were transformed to robes of ermine
And her staff became a feather
Yes a shining silver feather

And again the wigwam trembled
Swayed and rushed through airy currents
Through transparent cloud and vapor
And amid celestial splendors
On the Evening Star alighted
As a snowflake falls on snowflake
As a leaf drops on a river
As the thistledown on water

Forth with cheerful words of welcome
Came the father of Osseo
He with radiant locks of silver
He with eyes serene and tender
And he said My son Osseo
Hang the cage of birds you bring there
Hang the cage with rods of silver
And the birds with glistening feathers
At the doorway of my wigwam

At the door he hung the birdcage
And they entered in and gladly
Listened to Osseos father
Ruler of the Star of Evening
As he said O my Osseo
I have had compassion on you
Given you back your youth and beauty
Into birds of various plumage
Changed your sisters and their husbands
Changed them thus because they mocked you
In the figure of the old man
In that aspect sad and wrinkled
Could not see your heart of passion
Could not see your youth immortal
Only Oweenee the faithful
Saw your naked heart and loved you

In the lodge that glimmers yonder
In the little star that twinkles
Through the vapors on the left hand
Lives the envious Evil Spirit
The Wabeno the magician
Who transformed you to an old man
Take heed lest his beams fall on you
For the rays he darts around him
Are the power of his enchantment
Are the arrows that he uses

Many years in peace and quiet
On the peaceful Star of Evening
Dwelt Osseo with his father
Many years in song and flutter
At the doorway of the wigwam
Hung the cage with rods of silver
And fair Oweenee the faithful
Bore a son unto Osseo
With the beauty of his mother
With the courage of his father

And the boy grew up and prospered
And Osseo to delight him
Made him little bows and arrows
Opened the great cage of silver
And let loose his aunts and uncles
All those birds with glossy feathers
For his little son to shoot at

Round and round they wheeled and darted
Filled the Evening Star with music
With their songs of joy and freedom
Filled the Evening Star with splendor
With the fluttering of their plumage
Till the boy the little hunter
Bent his bow and shot an arrow
Shot a swift and fatal arrow
And a bird with shining feathers
At his feet fell wounded sorely

But O wondrous transformation
T was no bird he saw before him
T was a beautiful young woman
With the arrow in her bosom

When her blood fell on the planet
On the sacred Star of Evening
Broken was the spell of magic
Powerless was the strange enchantment
And the youth the fearless bowman
Suddenly felt himself descending
Held by unseen hands but sinking
Downward through the empty spaces
Downward through the clouds and vapors
Till he rested on an island
On an island green and grassy
Yonder in the BigSeaWater

After him he saw descending
All the birds with shining feathers
Fluttering falling wafted downward
Like the painted leaves of Autumn
And the lodge with poles of silver
With its roof like wings of beetles
Like the shining shards of beetles
By the winds of heaven uplifted
Slowly sank upon the island
Bringing back the good Osseo
Bringing Oweenee the faithful

Then the birds again transfigured
Reassumed the shape of mortals
Took their shape but not their stature
They remained as Little People
Like the pygmies the PukWudjies
And on pleasant nights of Summer
When the Evening Star was shining
Hand in hand they danced together
On the islands craggy headlands
On the sandbeach low and level

Still their glittering lodge is seen there
On the tranquil Summer evenings
And upon the shore the fisher
Sometimes hears their happy voices
Sees them dancing in the starlight 

When the story was completed
When the wondrous tale was ended
Looking round upon his listeners
Solemnly Iagoo added
There are great men I have known such
Whom their people understand not
Whom they even make a jest of
Scoff and jeer at in derision
From the story of Osseo
Let us learn the fate of jesters

All the wedding guests delighted
Listened to the marvellous story
Listened laughing and applauding
And they whispered to each other
Does he mean himself I wonder
And are we the aunts and uncles

Then again sang Chibiabos
Sang a song of love and longing
In those accents sweet and tender
In those tones of pensive sadness
Sang a maidens lamentation
For her lover her Algonquin

When I think of my beloved
Ah me think of my beloved
When my heart is thinking of him
O my sweetheart my Algonquin

Ah me when I parted from him
Round my neck he hung the wampum
As a pledge the snowwhite wampum
O my sweetheart my Algonquin

I will go with you he whispered
Ah me to your native country
Let me go with you he whispered
O my sweetheart my Algonquin
Far away away I answered
Very far away I answered
Ah me is my native country
O my sweetheart my Algonquin

When I looked back to behold him
Where we parted to behold him
After me he still was gazing
O my sweetheart my Algonquin

By the tree he still was standing
By the fallen tree was standing
That had dropped into the water
O my sweetheart my Algonquin

When I think of my beloved
Ah me think of my beloved
When my heart is thinking of him
O my sweetheart my Algonquin

Such was Hiawathas Wedding
Such the dance of PauPukKeewis
Such the story of Iagoo
Such the songs of Chibiabos
Thus the wedding banquet ended
And the wedding guests departed
Leaving Hiawatha happy
With the night and Minnehaha

 XIII

 Blessing the Cornfields

Sing O Song of Hiawatha
Of the happy days that followed
In the land of the Ojibways
In the pleasant land and peaceful
Sing the mysteries of Mondamin
Sing the Blessing of the Cornfields

Buried was the bloody hatchet
Buried was the dreadful warclub
Buried were all warlike weapons
And the warcry was forgotten
There was peace among the nations
Unmolested roved the hunters
Built the birch canoe for sailing
Caught the fish in lake and river
Shot the deer and trapped the beaver
Unmolested worked the women
Made their sugar from the maple
Gathered wild rice in the meadows
Dressed the skins of deer and beaver

All around the happy village
Stood the maizefields green and shining
Waved the green plumes of Mondamin
Waved his soft and sunny tresses
Filling all the land with plenty
T was the women who in Springtime
Planted the broad fields and fruitful
Buried in the earth Mondamin
T was the women who in Autumn
Stripped the yellow husks of harvest
Stripped the garments from Mondamin
Even as Hiawatha taught them

Once when all the maize was planted
Hiawatha wise and thoughtful
Spake and said to Minnehaha
To his wife the Laughing Water
You shall bless tonight the cornfields
Draw a magic circle round them
To protect them from destruction
Blast of mildew blight of insect
Wagemin the thief of cornfields
Paimosaid who steals the maizeear

In the night when all is silence
In the night when all is darkness
When the Spirit of Sleep Nepahwin
Shuts the doors of all the wigwams
So that not an ear can hear you
So that not an eye can see you
Rise up from your bed in silence
Lay aside your garments wholly
Walk around the fields you planted
Round the borders of the cornfields
Covered by your tresses only
Robed with darkness as a garment

Thus the fields shall be more fruitful
And the passing of your footsteps
Draw a magic circle round them
So that neither blight nor mildew
Neither burrowing worm nor insect
Shall pass oer the magic circle
Not the dragonfly Kwoneshe
Nor the spider Subbekashe
Nor the grasshopper Pahpukkeena
Nor the mighty caterpillar
Waymukkwana with the bearskin
King of all the caterpillars

On the treetops near the cornfields
Sat the hungry crows and ravens
Kahgahgee the King of Ravens
With his band of black marauders
And they laughed at Hiawatha
Till the treetops shook with laughter
With their melancholy laughter
At the words of Hiawatha
Hear him said they hear the Wise Man
Hear the plots of Hiawatha

When the noiseless night descended
Broad and dark oer field and forest
When the mournful Wawonaissa
Sorrowing sang among the hemlocks
And the Spirit of Sleep Nepahwin
Shut the doors of all the wigwams
From her bed rose Laughing Water
Laid aside her garments wholly
And with darkness clothed and guarded
Unashamed and unaffrighted
Walked securely round the cornfields
Drew the sacred magic circle
Of her footprints round the cornfields

No one but the Midnight only
Saw her beauty in the darkness
No one but the Wawonaissa
Heard the panting of her bosom
Guskewau the darkness wrapped her
Closely in his sacred mantle
So that none might see her beauty
So that none might boast I saw her

On the morrow as the day dawned
Kahgahgee the King of Ravens
Gathered all his black marauders
Crows and blackbirds jays and ravens
Clamorous on the dusky treetops
And descended fast and fearless
On the fields of Hiawatha
On the grave of the Mondamin

We will drag Mondamin said they
From the grave where he is buried
Spite of all the magic circles
Laughing Water draws around it
Spite of all the sacred footprints
Minnehaha stamps upon it

But the wary Hiawatha
Ever thoughtful careful watchful
Had oerheard the scornful laughter
When they mocked him from the treetops
Kaw he said my friends the ravens
Kahgahgee my King of Ravens
I will teach you all a lesson
That shall not be soon forgotten

He had risen before the daybreak
He had spread oer all the cornfields
Snares to catch the black marauders
And was lying now in ambush
In the neighboring grove of pinetrees
Waiting for the crows and blackbirds
Waiting for the jays and ravens

Soon they came with caw and clamor
Rush of wings and cry of voices
To their work of devastation
Settling down upon the cornfields
Delving deep with beak and talon
For the body of Mondamin
And with all their craft and cunning
All their skill in wiles of warfare
They perceived no danger near them
Till their claws became entangled
Till they found themselves imprisoned
In the snares of Hiawatha

From his place of ambush came he
Striding terrible among them
And so awful was his aspect
That the bravest quailed with terror
Without mercy he destroyed them
Right and left by tens and twenties
And their wretched lifeless bodies
Hung aloft on poles for scarecrows
Round the consecrated cornfields
As a signal of his vengeance
As a warning to marauders

Only Kahgahgee the leader
Kahgahgee the King of Ravens
He alone was spared among them
As a hostage for his people
With his prisonerstring he bound him
Led him captive to his wigwam
Tied him fast with cords of elmbark
To the ridgepole of his wigwam

Kahgahgee my raven said he
You the leader of the robbers
You the plotter of this mischief
The contriver of this outrage
I will keep you I will hold you
As a hostage for your people
As a pledge of good behavior

And he left him grim and sulky
Sitting in the morning sunshine
On the summit of the wigwam
Croaking fiercely his displeasure
Flapping his great sable pinions
Vainly struggling for his freedom
Vainly calling on his people

Summer passed and Shawondasee
Breathed his sighs oer all the landscape
From the Southland sent his ardor
Wafted kisses warm and tender
And the maizefield grew and ripened
Till it stood in all the splendor
Of its garments green and yellow
Of its tassels and its plumage
And the maizeears full and shining
Gleamed from bursting sheaths of verdure

Then Nokomis the old woman
Spake and said to Minnehaha

T is the Moon when leaves are falling
All the wild rice has been gathered
And the maize is ripe and ready
Let us gather in the harvest
Let us wrestle with Mondamin
Strip him of his plumes and tassels
Of his garments green and yellow

And the merry Laughing Water
Went rejoicing from the wigwam
With Nokomis old and wrinkled
And they called the women round them
Called the young men and the maidens
To the harvest of the cornfields
To the husking of the maizeear

On the border of the forest
Underneath the fragrant pinetrees
Sat the old men and the warriors
Smoking in the pleasant shadow
In uninterrupted silence
Looked they at the gamesome labor
Of the young men and the women
Listened to their noisy talking
To their laughter and their singing
Heard them chattering like the magpies
Heard them laughing like the bluejays
Heard them singing like the robins

And wheneer some lucky maiden
Found a red ear in the husking
Found a maizeear red as blood is
Nushka cried they all together
Nushka you shall have a sweetheart
You shall have a handsome husband
Ugh the old men all responded
From their seats beneath the pinetrees

And wheneer a youth or maiden
Found a crooked ear in husking
Found a maizeear in the husking
Blighted mildewed or misshapen
Then they laughed and sang together
Crept and limped about the cornfields
Mimicked in their gait and gestures
Some old man bent almost double
Singing singly or together
Wagemin the thief of cornfields
Paimosaid who steals the maizeear

Till the cornfields rang with laughter
Till from Hiawathas wigwam
Kahgahgee the King of Ravens
Screamed and quivered in his anger
And from all the neighboring treetops
Cawed and croaked the black marauders
Ugh the old men all responded
From their seats beneath the pinetrees

 PictureWriting

In those days said Hiawatha
Lo how all things fade and perish
From the memory of the old men
Pass away the great traditions
The achievements of the warriors
The adventures of the hunters
All the wisdom of the Medas
All the craft of the Wabenos
All the marvellous dreams and visions
Of the Jossakeeds the Prophets

Great men die and are forgotten
Wise men speak their words of wisdom
Perish in the ears that hear them
Do not reach the generations
That as yet unborn are waiting
In the great mysterious darkness
Of the speechless days that shall be

On the graveposts of our fathers
Are no signs no figures painted
Who are in those graves we know not
Only know they are our fathers
Of what kith they are and kindred
From what old ancestral Totem
Be it Eagle Bear or Beaver
They descended this we know not
Only know they are our fathers

Face to face we speak together
But we cannot speak when absent
Cannot send our voices from us
To the friends that dwell afar off
Cannot send a secret message
But the bearer learns our secret
May pervert it may betray it
May reveal it unto others
Thus said Hiawatha walking
In the solitary forest
Pondering musing in the forest
On the welfare of his people

From his pouch he took his colors
Took his paints of different colors
On the smooth bark of a birchtree
Painted many shapes and figures
Wonderful and mystic figures
And each figure had a meaning
Each some word or thought suggested

Gitche Manito the Mighty
He the Master of Life was painted
As an egg with points projecting
To the four winds of the heavens
Everywhere is the Great Spirit
Was the meaning of this symbol

Mitche Manito the Mighty
He the dreadful Spirit of Evil
As a serpent was depicted
As Kenabeek the great serpent
Very crafty very cunning
Is the creeping Spirit of Evil
Was the meaning of this symbol

Life and Death he drew as circles
Life was white but Death was darkened
Sun and moon and stars he painted
Man and beast and fish and reptile
Forests mountains lakes and rivers

For the earth he drew a straight line
For the sky a bow above it
White the space between for daytime
Filled with little stars for nighttime
On the left a point for sunrise
On the right a point for sunset
On the top a point for noontide
And for rain and cloudy weather
Waving lines descending from it

Footprints pointing towards a wigwam
Were a sign of invitation
Were a sign of guests assembling
Bloody hands with palms uplifted
Were a symbol of destruction
Were a hostile sign and symbol

All these things did Hiawatha
Show unto his wondering people
And interpreted their meaning
And he said Behold your graveposts
Have no mark no sign nor symbol
Go and paint them all with figures
Each one with its household symbol
With its own ancestral Totem
So that those who follow after
May distinguish them and know them

And they painted on the graveposts
On the graves yet unforgotten
Each his own ancestral Totem
Each the symbol of his household
Figures of the Bear and Reindeer
Of the Turtle Crane and Beaver
Each inverted as a token
That the owner was departed
That the chief who bore the symbol
Lay beneath in dust and ashes

And the Jossakeeds the Prophets
The Wabenos the Magicians
And the Medicinemen the Medas
Painted upon bark and deerskin
Figures for the songs they chanted
For each song a separate symbol
Figures mystical and awful
Figures strange and brightly colored
And each figure had its meaning
Each some magic song suggested

The Great Spirit the Creator
Flashing light through all the heaven
The Great Serpent the Kenabeek
With his bloody crest erected
Creeping looking into heaven
In the sky the sun that listens
And the moon eclipsed and dying
Owl and eagle crane and henhawk
And the cormorant bird of magic
Headless men that walk the heavens
Bodies lying pierced with arrows
Bloody hands of death uplifted
Flags on graves and great warcaptains
Grasping both the earth and heaven

Such as these the shapes they painted
On the birchbark and the deerskin
Songs of war and songs of hunting
Songs of medicine and of magic
All were written in these figures
For each figure had its meaning
Each its separate song recorded

Nor forgotten was the LoveSong
The most subtle of all medicines
The most potent spell of magic
Dangerous more than war or hunting
Thus the LoveSong was recorded
Symbol and interpretation

First a human figure standing
Painted in the brightest scarlet
T is the lover the musician
And the meaning is My painting
Makes me powerful over others

Then the figure seated singing
Playing on a drum of magic
And the interpretation Listen
T is my voice you hear my singing

Then the same red figure seated
In the shelter of a wigwam
And the meaning of the symbol
I will come and sit beside you
In the mystery of my passion

Then two figures man and woman
Standing hand in hand together
With their hands so clasped together
That they seemed in one united
And the words thus represented
Are I see your heart within you
And your cheeks are red with blushes

Next the maiden on an island
In the centre of an Island
And the song this shape suggested
Was Though you were at a distance
Were upon some faroff island
Such the spell I cast upon you
Such the magic power of passion
I could straightway draw you to me

Then the figure of the maiden
Sleeping and the lover near her
Whispering to her in her slumbers
Saying Though you were far from me
In the land of Sleep and Silence
Still the voice of love would reach you

And the last of all the figures
Was a heart within a circle
Drawn within a magic circle
And the image had this meaning
Naked lies your heart before me
To your naked heart I whisper

Thus it was that Hiawatha
In his wisdom taught the people
All the mysteries of painting
All the art of PictureWriting
On the smooth bark of the birchtree
On the white skin of the reindeer
On the graveposts of the village

 Hiawathas Lamentation

In those days the Evil Spirits
All the Manitos of mischief
Fearing Hiawathas wisdom
And his love for Chibiabos
Jealous of their faithful friendship
And their noble words and actions
Made at length a league against them
To molest them and destroy them

Hiawatha wise and wary
Often said to Chibiabos
O my brother do not leave me
Lest the Evil Spirits harm you
Chibiabos young and heedless
Laughing shook his coalblack tresses
Answered ever sweet and childlike
Do not fear for me O brother
Harm and evil come not near me

Once when Peboan the Winter
Roofed with ice the BigSeaWater
When the snowflakes whirling downward
Hissed among the withered oakleaves
Changed the pinetrees into wigwams
Covered all the earth with silence
Armed with arrows shod with snowshoes
Heeding not his brothers warning
Fearing not the Evil Spirits
Forth to hunt the deer with antlers
All alone went Chibiabos

Right across the BigSeaWater
Sprang with speed the deer before him
With the wind and snow he followed
Oer the treacherous ice he followed
Wild with all the fierce commotion
And the rapture of the hunting

But beneath the Evil Spirits
Lay in ambush waiting for him
Broke the treacherous ice beneath him
Dragged him downward to the bottom
Buried in the sand his body
Unktahee the god of water
He the god of the Dacotahs
Drowned him in the deep abysses
Of the lake of Gitche Gumee

From the headlands Hiawatha
Sent forth such a wail of anguish
Such a fearful lamentation
That the bison paused to listen
And the wolves howled from the prairies
And the thunder in the distance
Starting answered Baimwawa

Then his face with black he painted
With his robe his head he covered
In his wigwam sat lamenting
Seven long weeks he sat lamenting
Uttering still this moan of sorrow

He is dead the sweet musician
He the sweetest of all singers
He has gone from us forever
He has moved a little nearer
To the Master of all music
To the Master of all singing
O my brother Chibiabos

And the melancholy firtrees
Waved their dark green fans above him
Waved their purple cones above him
Sighing with him to console him
Mingling with his lamentation
Their complaining their lamenting

Came the Spring and all the forest
Looked in vain for Chibiabos
Sighed the rivulet Sebowisha
Sighed the rushes in the meadow

From the treetops sang the bluebird
Sang the bluebird the Owaissa
Chibiabos Chibiabos
He is dead the sweet musician

From the wigwam sang the robin
Sang the robin the Opechee
Chibiabos Chibiabos
He is dead the sweetest singer

And at night through all the forest
Went the whippoorwill complaining
Wailing went the Wawonaissa
Chibiabos Chibiabos
He is dead the sweet musician
He the sweetest of all singers

Then the Medicinemen the Medas
The magicians the Wabenos
And the Jossakeeds the Prophets
Came to visit Hiawatha
Built a Sacred Lodge beside him
To appease him to console him
Walked in silent grave procession
Bearing each a pouch of healing
Skin of beaver lynx or otter
Filled with magic roots and simples
Filled with very potent medicines

When he heard their steps approaching
Hiawatha ceased lamenting
Called no more on Chibiabos
Naught he questioned naught he answered
But his mournful head uncovered
From his face the mourning colors
Washed he slowly and in silence
Slowly and in silence followed
Onward to the Sacred Wigwam

There a magic drink they gave him
Made of Nahmawusk the spearmint
And Wabenowusk the yarrow
Roots of power and herbs of healing
Beat their drums and shook their rattles
Chanted singly and in chorus
Mystic songs like these they chanted

I myself myself behold me
T is the great Gray Eagle talking
Come ye white crows come and hear him
The loudspeaking thunder helps me
All the unseen spirits help me
I can hear their voices calling
All around the sky I hear them
I can blow you strong my brother
I can heal you Hiawatha

Hiauha replied the chorus
Wayhaway the mystic chorus

Friends of mine are all the serpents
Hear me shake my skin of henhawk
Mahng the white loon I can kill him
I can shoot your heart and kill it
I can blow you strong my brother
I can heal you Hiawatha 

Hiauha replied the chorus
Wayhaway the mystic chorus

I myself myself the prophet
When I speak the wigwam trembles
Shakes the Sacred Lodge with terror
Hands unseen begin to shake it
When I walk the sky I tread on
Bends and makes a noise beneath me
I can blow you strong my brother
Rise and speak O Hiawatha

Hiauha replied the chorus
Wayhaway the mystic chorus

Then they shook their medicinepouches
Oer the head of Hiawatha
Danced their medicinedance around him
And upstarting wild and haggard
Like a man from dreams awakened
He was healed of all his madness
As the clouds are swept from heaven
Straightway from his brain departed
All his moody melancholy
As the ice is swept from rivers
Straightway from his heart departed
All his sorrow and affliction

Then they summoned Chibiabos
From his grave beneath the waters
From the sands of Gitche Gumee
Summoned Hiawathas brother
And so mighty was the magic
Of that cry and invocation
That he heard it as he lay there
Underneath the BigSeaWater
From the sand he rose and listened
Heard the music and the singing
Came obedient to the summons
To the doorway of the wigwam
But to enter they forbade him

Through a chink a coal they gave him
Through the door a burning firebrand
Ruler in the Land of Spirits
Ruler oer the dead they made him
Telling him a fire to kindle
For all those that died thereafter
Campfires for their night encampments
On their solitary journey
To the kingdom of Ponemah
To the land of the Hereafter

From the village of his childhood
From the homes of those who knew him
Passing silent through the forest
Like a smokewreath wafted sideways
Slowly vanished Chibiabos
Where he passed the branches moved not
Where he trod the grasses bent not
And the fallen leaves of last year
Made no sound beneath his footstep

Four whole days he journeyed onward
Down the pathway of the dead men
On the deadmans strawberry feasted
Crossed the melancholy river
On the swinging log he crossed it
Came unto the Lake of Silver
In the Stone Canoe was carried
To the Islands of the Blessed
To the land of ghosts and shadows

On that journey moving slowly
Many weary spirits saw he
Panting under heavy burdens
Laden with warclubs bows and arrows
Robes of fur and pots and kettles
And with food that friends had given
For that solitary journey

Ay why do the living said they
Lay such heavy burdens on us
Better were it to go naked
Better were it to go fasting
Than to bear such heavy burdens
On our long and weary journey
Forth then issued Hiawatha
Wandered eastward wandered westward
Teaching men the use of simples
And the antidotes for poisons
And the cure of all diseases
Thus was first made known to mortals
All the mystery of Medamin
All the sacred art of healing

 PauPukKeewis

You shall hear how PauPukKeewis
He the handsome Yenadizze
Whom the people called the StormFool
Vexed the village with disturbance
You shall hear of all his mischief
And his flight from Hiawatha
And his wondrous transmigrations
And the end of his adventures

On the shores of Gitche Gumee
On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo
By the shining BigSeaWater
Stood the lodge of PauPukKeewis
It was he who in his frenzy
Whirled these drifting sands together
On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo
When among the guests assembled
He so merrily and madly
Danced at Hiawathas wedding
Danced the Beggars Dance to please them

Now in search of new adventures
From his lodge went PauPukKeewis
Came with speed into the village
Found the young men all assembled
In the lodge of old Iagoo
Listening to his monstrous stories
To his wonderful adventures

He was telling them the story
Of Ojeeg the SummerMaker
How he made a hole in heaven
How he climbed up into heaven
And let out the summerweather
The perpetual pleasant Summer
How the Otter first essayed it
How the Beaver Lynx and Badger
Tried in turn the great achievement
From the summit of the mountain
Smote their fists against the heavens
Smote against the sky their foreheads
Cracked the sky but could not break it
How the Wolverine uprising
Made him ready for the encounter
Bent his knees down like a squirrel
Drew his arms back like a cricket

Once he leaped said old Iagoo
Once he leaped and lo above him
Bent the sky as ice in rivers
When the waters rise beneath it
Twice he leaped and lo above him
Cracked the sky as ice in rivers
When the freshet is at highest
Thrice he leaped and lo above him
Broke the shattered sky asunder
And he disappeared within it
And Ojeeg the Fisher Weasel
With a bound went in behind him

Hark you shouted PauPukKeewis
As he entered at the doorway
I am tired of all this talking
Tired of old Iagoos stories
Tired of Hiawathas wisdom
Here is something to amuse you
Better than this endless talking

Then from out his pouch of wolfskin
Forth he drew with solemn manner
All the game of Bowl and Counters
Pugasaing with thirteen pieces
White on one side were they painted
And vermilion on the other
Two Kenabeeks or great serpents
Two Ininewug or wedgemen
One great warclub Pugamaugun
And one slender fish the Keego
Four round pieces Ozawabeeks
And three Sheshebwug or ducklings
All were made of bone and painted
All except the Ozawabeeks
These were brass on one side burnished
And were black upon the other

In a wooden bowl he placed them
Shook and jostled them together
Threw them on the ground before him
Thus exclaiming and explaining
Red side up are all the pieces
And one great Kenabeek standing
On the bright side of a brass piece
On a burnished Ozawabeek
Thirteen tens and eight are counted

Then again he shook the pieces
Shook and jostled them together
Threw them on the ground before him
Still exclaiming and explaining
White are both the great Kenabeeks
White the Ininewug the wedgemen
Red are all the other pieces
Five tens and an eight are counted

Thus he taught the game of hazard
Thus displayed it and explained it
Running through its various chances
Various changes various meanings
Twenty curious eyes stared at him
Full of eagerness stared at him

Many games said old Iagoo
Many games of skill and hazard
Have I seen in different nations
Have I played in different countries
He who plays with old Iagoo
Must have very nimble fingers
Though you think yourself so skilful
I can beat you PauPukKeewis
I can even give you lessons
In your game of Bowl and Counters

So they sat and played together
All the old men and the young men
Played for dresses weapons wampum
Played till midnight played till morning
Played until the Yenadizze
Till the cunning PauPukKeewis
Of their treasures had despoiled them
Of the best of all their dresses
Shirts of deerskin robes of ermine
Belts of wampum crests of feathers
Warlike weapons pipes and pouches
Twenty eyes glared wildly at him
Like the eyes of wolves glared at him

Said the lucky PauPukKeewis
In my wigwam I am lonely
In my wanderings and adventures
I have need of a companion
Fain would have a Meshinauwa
An attendant and pipebearer
I will venture all these winnings
All these garments heaped about me
All this wampum all these feathers
On a single throw will venture
All against the young man yonder
T was a youth of sixteen summers
T was a nephew of Iagoo
FaceinaMist the people called him

As the fire burns in a pipehead
Dusky red beneath the ashes
So beneath his shaggy eyebrows
Glowed the eyes of old Iagoo
Ugh he answered very fiercely
Ugh they answered all and each one

Seized the wooden bowl the old man
Closely in his bony fingers
Clutched the fatal bowl Onagon
Shook it fiercely and with fury
Made the pieces ring together
As he threw them down before him

Red were both the great Kenabeeks
Red the Ininewug the wedgemen
Red the Sheshebwug the ducklings
Black the four brass Ozawabeeks
White alone the fish the Keego
Only five the pieces counted

Then the smiling PauPukKeewis
Shook the bowl and threw the pieces
Lightly in the air he tossed them
And they fell about him scattered
Dark and bright the Ozawabeeks
Red and white the other pieces
And upright among the others
One Ininewug was standing
Even as crafty PauPukKeewis
Stood alone among the players
Saying Five tens mine the game is

Twenty eyes glared at him fiercely
Like the eyes of wolves glared at him
As he turned and left the wigwam
Followed by his Meshinauwa
By the nephew of Iagoo
By the tall and graceful stripling
Bearing in his arms the winnings
Shirts of deerskin robes of ermine
Belts of wampum pipes and weapons

Carry them said PauPukKeewis
Pointing with his fan of feathers
To my wigwam far to eastward
On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo

Hot and red with smoke and gambling
Were the eyes of PauPukKeewis
As he came forth to the freshness
Of the pleasant Summer morning
All the birds were singing gayly
All the streamlets flowing swiftly
And the heart of PauPukKeewis
Sang with pleasure as the birds sing
Beat with triumph like the streamlets
As he wandered through the village
In the early gray of morning
With his fan of turkeyfeathers
With his plumes and tufts of swans down
Till he reached the farthest wigwam
Reached the lodge of Hiawatha

Silent was it and deserted
No one met him at the doorway
No one came to bid him welcome
But the birds were singing round it
In and out and round the doorway
Hopping singing fluttering feeding
And aloft upon the ridgepole
Kahgahgee the King of Ravens
Sat with fiery eyes and screaming
Flapped his wings at PauPukKeewis

All are gone the lodge is empty
Thus it was spake PauPukKeewis
In his heart resolving mischief
Gone is wary Hiawatha
Gone the silly Laughing Water
Gone Nokomis the old woman
And the lodge is left unguarded

By the neck he seized the raven
Whirled it round him like a rattle
Like a medicinepouch he shook it
Strangled Kahgahgee the raven
From the ridgepole of the wigwam
Left its lifeless body hanging
As an insult to its master
As a taunt to Hiawatha

With a stealthy step he entered
Round the lodge in wild disorder
Threw the household things about him
Piled together in confusion
Bowls of wood and earthen kettles
Robes of buffalo and beaver
Skins of otter lynx and ermine
As an insult to Nokomis
As a taunt to Minnehaha

Then departed PauPukKeewis
Whistling singing through the forest
Whistling gayly to the squirrels
Who from hollow boughs above him
Dropped their acornshells upon him
Singing gayly to the wood birds
Who from out the leafy darkness
Answered with a song as merry

Then he climbed the rocky headlands
Looking oer the Gitche Gumee
Perched himself upon their summit
Waiting full of mirth and mischief
The return of Hiawatha

Stretched upon his back he lay there
Far below him splashed the waters
Plashed and washed the dreamy waters
Far above him swam the heavens
Swam the dizzy dreamy heavens
Round him hovered fluttered rustled
Hiawathas mountain chickens
Flockwise swept and wheeled about him
Almost brushed him with their pinions

And he killed them as he lay there
Slaughtered them by tens and twenties
Threw their bodies down the headland
Threw them on the beach below him
Till at length Kayoshk the seagull
Perched upon a crag above them
Shouted It is PauPukKeewis
He is slaying us by hundreds
Send a message to our brother
Tidings send to Hiawatha

 The Hunting of PauPukKeewis

Full of wrath was Hiawatha
When he came into the village
Found the people in confusion
Heard of all the misdemeanors
All the malice and the mischief
Of the cunning PauPukKeewis

Hard his breath came through his nostrils
Through his teeth he buzzed and muttered
Words of anger and resentment
Hot and humming like a hornet
I will slay this PauPukKeewis
Slay this mischiefmaker said he
Not so long and wide the world is
Not so rude and rough the way is
That my wrath shall not attain him
That my vengeance shall not reach him

Then in swift pursuit departed
Hiawatha and the hunters
On the trail of PauPukKeewis
Through the forest where he passed it
To the headlands where he rested
But they found not PauPukKeewis
Only in the trampled grasses
In the whortleberrybushes
Found the couch where he had rested
Found the impress of his body

From the lowlands far beneath them
From the Muskoday the meadow
PauPukKeewis turning backward
Made a gesture of defiance
Made a gesture of derision
And aloud cried Hiawatha
From the summit of the mountains
Not so long and wide the world is
Not so rude and rough the way is
But my wrath shall overtake you
And my vengeance shall attain you

Over rock and over river
Through bush and brake and forest
Ran the cunning PauPukKeewis
Like an antelope he bounded
Till he came unto a streamlet
In the middle of the forest
To a streamlet still and tranquil
That had overflowed its margin
To a dam made by the beavers
To a pond of quiet water
Where kneedeep the trees were standing
Where the water lilies floated
Where the rushes waved and whispered

On the dam stood PauPukKeewis
On the dam of trunks and branches
Through whose chinks the water spouted
Oer whose summit flowed the streamlet
From the bottom rose the beaver
Looked with two great eyes of wonder
Eyes that seemed to ask a question
At the stranger PauPukKeewis

On the dam stood PauPukKeewis
Oer his ankles flowed the streamlet
Flowed the bright and silvery water
And he spake unto the beaver
With a smile he spake in this wise

O my friend Ahmeek the beaver
Cool and pleasant is the water
Let me dive into the water
Let me rest there in your lodges
Change me too into a beaver

Cautiously replied the beaver
With reserve he thus made answer
Let me first consult the others
Let me ask the other beavers
Down he sank into the water
Heavily sank he as a stone sinks
Down among the leaves and branches
Brown and matted at the bottom

On the dam stood PauPukKeewis
Oer his ankles flowed the streamlet
Spouted through the chinks below him
Dashed upon the stones beneath him
Spread serene and calm before him
And the sunshine and the shadows
Fell in flecks and gleams upon him
Fell in little shining patches
Through the waving rustling branches

From the bottom rose the beavers
Silently above the surface
Rose one head and then another
Till the pond seemed full of beavers
Full of black and shining faces

To the beavers PauPukKeewis
Spake entreating said in this wise
Very pleasant is your dwelling
O my friends and safe from danger
Can you not with all your cunning
All your wisdom and contrivance
Change me too into a beaver

Yes replied Ahmeek the beaver
He the King of all the beavers
Let yourself slide down among us
Down into the tranquil water

Down into the pond among them
Silently sank PauPukKeewis
Black became his shirt of deerskin
Black his moccasins and leggings
In a broad black tail behind him
Spread his foxtails and his fringes
He was changed into a beaver

Make me large said PauPukKeewis
Make me large and make me larger
Larger than the other beavers
Yes the beaver chief responded
When our lodge below you enter
In our wigwam we will make you
Ten times larger than the others

Thus into the clear brown water
Silently sank PauPukKeewis
Found the bottom covered over
With the trunks of trees and branches
Hoards of food against the winter
Piles and heaps against the famine
Found the lodge with arching doorway
Leading into spacious chambers

Here they made him large and larger
Made him largest of the beavers
Ten times larger than the others
You shall be our ruler said they
Chief and King of all the beavers

But not long had PauPukKeewis
Sat in state among the beavers
When there came a voice of warning
From the watchman at his station
In the waterflags and lilies
Saying Here is Hiawatha
Hiawatha with his hunters

Then they heard a cry above them
Heard a shouting and a tramping
Heard a crashing and a rushing
And the water round and oer them
Sank and sucked away in eddies
And they knew their dam was broken

On the lodges roof the hunters
Leaped and broke it all asunder
Streamed the sunshine through the crevice
Sprang the beavers through the doorway
Hid themselves in deeper water
In the channel of the streamlet
But the mighty PauPukKeewis
Could not pass beneath the doorway
He was puffed with pride and feeding
He was swollen like a bladder

Through the roof looked Hiawatha
Cried aloud O PauPukKeewis
Vain are all your craft and cunning
Vain your manifold disguises
Well I know you PauPukKeewis
With their clubs they beat and bruised him
Beat to death poor PauPukKeewis
Pounded him as maize is pounded
Till his skull was crushed to pieces

Six tall hunters lithe and limber
Bore him home on poles and branches
Bore the body of the beaver
But the ghost the Jeebi in him
Thought and felt as PauPukKeewis
Still lived on as PauPukKeewis

And it fluttered strove and struggled
Waving hither waving thither
As the curtains of a wigwam
Struggle with their thongs of deerskin
When the wintry wind is blowing
Till it drew itself together
Till it rose up from the body
Till it took the form and features
Of the cunning PauPukKeewis
Vanishing into the forest

But the wary Hiawatha
Saw the figure ere it vanished
Saw the form of PauPukKeewis
Glide into the soft blue shadow
Of the pinetrees of the forest
Toward the squares of white beyond it
Toward an opening in the forest
Like a wind it rushed and panted
Bending all the boughs before it
And behind it as the rain comes
Came the steps of Hiawatha

To a lake with many islands
Came the breathless PauPukKeewis
Where among the waterlilies
Pishnekuh the brant were sailing
Through the tufts of rushes floating
Steering through the reedy Islands
Now their broad black beaks they lifted
Now they plunged beneath the water
Now they darkened in the shadow
Now they brightened in the sunshine

Pishnekuh cried PauPukKeewis
Pishnekuh my brothers said he
Change me to a brant with plumage
With a shining neck and feathers
Make me large and make me larger
Ten times larger than the others

Straightway to a brant they changed him
With two huge and dusky pinions
With a bosom smooth and rounded
With a bill like two great paddles
Made him larger than the others
Ten times larger than the largest
Just as shouting from the forest
On the shore stood Hiawatha

Up they rose with cry and clamor
With a whir and beat of pinions
Rose up from the reedy Islands
From the waterflags and lilies
And they said to PauPukKeewis
In your flying look not downward
Take good heed and look not downward
Lest some strange mischance should happen
Lest some great mishap befall you

Fast and far they fled to northward
Fast and far through mist and sunshine
Fed among the moors and fenlands
Slept among the reeds and rushes

On the morrow as they journeyed
Buoyed and lifted by the Southwind
Wafted onward by the Southwind
Blowing fresh and strong behind them
Rose a sound of human voices
Rose a clamor from beneath them
From the lodges of a village
From the people miles beneath them

For the people of the village
Saw the flock of brant with wonder
Saw the wings of PauPukKeewis
Flapping far up in the ether
Broader than two doorway curtains

PauPukKeewis heard the shouting
Knew the voice of Hiawatha
Knew the outcry of Iagoo
And forgetful of the warning
Drew his neck in and looked downward
And the wind that blew behind him
Caught his mighty fan of feathers
Sent him wheeling whirling downward

All in vain did PauPukKeewis
Struggle to regain his balance
Whirling round and round and downward
He beheld in turn the village
And in turn the flock above him
Saw the village coming nearer
And the flock receding farther
Heard the voices growing louder
Heard the shouting and the laughter
Saw no more the flocks above him
Only saw the earth beneath him
Dead out of the empty heaven
Dead among the shouting people
With a heavy sound and sullen
Fell the brant with broken pinions

But his soul his ghost his shadow
Still survived as PauPukKeewis
Took again the form and features
Of the handsome Yenadizze
And again went rushing onward
Followed fast by Hiawatha
Crying Not so wide the world is
Not so long and rough the way is
But my wrath shall overtake you
But my vengeance shall attain you

And so near he came so near him
That his hand was stretched to seize him
His right hand to seize and hold him
When the cunning PauPukKeewis
Whirled and spun about in circles
Fanned the air into a whirlwind
Danced the dust and leaves about him
And amid the whirling eddies
Sprang into a hollow oaktree
Changed himself into a serpent
Gliding out through root and rubbish

With his right hand Hiawatha
Smote amain the hollow oaktree
Rent it into shreds and splinters
Left it lying there in fragments
But in vain for PauPukKeewis
Once again in human figure
Full in sight ran on before him
Sped away in gust and whirlwind
On the shores of Gitche Gumee
Westward by the BigSeaWater
Came unto the rocky headlands
To the Pictured Rocks of sandstone
Looking over lake and landscape

And the Old Man of the Mountain
He the Manito of Mountains
Opened wide his rocky doorways
Opened wide his deep abysses
Giving PauPukKeewis shelter
In his caverns dark and dreary
Bidding PauPukKeewis welcome
To his gloomy lodge of sandstone

There without stood Hiawatha
Found the doorways closed against him
With his mittens Minjekahwun
Smote great caverns in the sandstone
Cried aloud in tones of thunder
Open I am Hiawatha
But the Old Man of the Mountain
Opened not and made no answer
From the silent crags of sandstone
From the gloomy rock abysses

Then he raised his hands to heaven
Called imploring on the tempest
Called Waywassimo the lightning
And the thunder Annemeekee
And they came with night and darkness
Sweeping down the BigSeaWater
From the distant Thunder Mountains
And the trembling PauPukKeewis
Heard the footsteps of the thunder
Saw the red eyes of the lightning
Was afraid and crouched and trembled

Then Waywassimo the lightning
Smote the doorways of the caverns
With his warclub smote the doorways
Smote the jutting crags of sandstone
And the thunder Annemeekee
Shouted down into the caverns
Saying Where is PauPukKeewis
And the crags fell and beneath them
Dead among the rocky ruins
Lay the cunning PauPukKeewis
Lay the handsome Yenadizze
Slain in his own human figure

Ended were his wild adventures
Ended were his tricks and gambols
Ended all his craft and cunning
Ended all his mischiefmaking
All his gambling and his dancing
All his wooing of the maidens

Then the noble Hiawatha
Took his soul his ghost his shadow
Spake and said O PauPukKeewis
Never more in human figure
Shall you search for new adventures
Never more with jest and laughter
Dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds
But above there in the heavens
You shall soar and sail in circles
I will change you to an eagle
To Keneu the great wareagle
Chief of all the fowls with feathers
Chief of Hiawathas chickens

And the name of PauPukKeewis
Lingers still among the people
Lingers still among the singers
And among the storytellers
And in Winter when the snowflakes
Whirl in eddies round the lodges
When the wind in gusty tumult
Oer the smokeflue pipes and whistles
There they cry comes PauPukKeewis
He is dancing through the village
He is gathering in his harvest



 XVIII

 The Death of Kwasind

Far and wide among the nations
Spread the name and fame of Kwasind
No man dared to strive with Kwasind
No man could compete with Kwasind
But the mischievous PukWudjies
They the envious Little People
They the fairies and the pygmies
Plotted and conspired against him

If this hateful Kwasind said they
If this great outrageous fellow
Goes on thus a little longer
Tearing everything he touches
Rending everything to pieces
Filling all the world with wonder
What becomes of the PukWudjies
Who will care for the PukWudjies
He will tread us down like mushrooms
Drive us all into the water
Give our bodies to be eaten
By the wicked Neebanawbaigs
By the Spirits of the water

So the angry Little People
All conspired against the Strong Man
All conspired to murder Kwasind
Yes to rid the world of Kwasind
The audacious overbearing
Heartless haughty dangerous Kwasind

Now this wondrous strength of Kwasind
In his crown alone was seated
In his crown too was his weakness
There alone could he be wounded
Nowhere else could weapon pierce him
Nowhere else could weapon harm him

Even there the only weapon
That could wound him that could slay him
Was the seedcone of the pinetree
Was the blue cone of the firtree
This was Kwasinds fatal secret
Known to no man among mortals
But the cunning Little People
The PukWudjies knew the secret
Knew the only way to kill him

So they gathered cones together
Gathered seedcones of the pinetree
Gathered blue cones of the firtree
In the woods by Taquamenaw
Brought them to the rivers margin
Heaped them in great piles together
Where the red rocks from the margin
Jutting overhang the river
There they lay in wait for Kwasind
The malicious Little People

T was an afternoon in Summer
Very hot and still the air was
Very smooth the gliding river
Motionless the sleeping shadows
Insects glistened in the sunshine
Insects skated on the water
Filled the drowsy air with buzzing
With a far resounding warcry

Down the river came the Strong Man
In his birch canoe came Kwasind
Floating slowly down the current
Of the sluggish Taquamenaw
Very languid with the weather
Very sleepy with the silence

From the overhanging branches
From the tassels of the birchtrees
Soft the Spirit of Sleep descended
By his airy hosts surrounded
His invisible attendants
Came the Spirit of Sleep Nepahwin
Like a burnished Dushkwoneshe
Like a dragonfly he hovered
Oer the drowsy head of Kwasind

To his ear there came a murmur
As of waves upon a seashore
As of faroff tumbling waters
As of winds among the pinetrees
And he felt upon his forehead
Blows of little airy warclubs
Wielded by the slumbrous legions
Of the Spirit of Sleep Nepahwin
As of some one breathing on him

At the first blow of their warclubs
Fell a drowsiness on Kwasind
At the second blow they smote him
Motionless his paddle rested
At the third before his vision
Reeled the landscape Into darkness
Very sound asleep was Kwasind

So he floated down the river
Like a blind man seated upright
Floated down the Taquamenaw
Underneath the trembling birchtrees
Underneath the wooded headlands
Underneath the war encampment
Of the pygmies the PukWudjies

There they stood all armed and waiting
Hurled the pinecones down upon him
Struck him on his brawny shoulders
On his crown defenceless struck him
Death to Kwasind was the sudden
Warcry of the Little People

And he sideways swayed and tumbled
Sideways fell into the river
Plunged beneath the sluggish water
Headlong as an otter plunges
And the birch canoe abandoned
Drifted empty down the river
Bottom upward swerved and drifted
Nothing more was seen of Kwasind

But the memory of the Strong Man
Lingered long among the people
And whenever through the forest
Raged and roared the wintry tempest
And the branches tossed and troubled
Creaked and groaned and split asunder
Kwasind cried they that is Kwasind
He is gathering in his firewood

 The Ghosts

Never stoops the soaring vulture
On his quarry in the desert
On the sick or wounded bison
But another vulture watching
From his high aerial lookout
Sees the downward plunge and follows
And a third pursues the second
Coming from the invisible ether
First a speck and then a vulture
Till the air is dark with pinions

So disasters come not singly
But as if they watched and waited
Scanning one anothers motions
When the first descends the others
Follow follow gathering flockwise
Round their victim sick and wounded
First a shadow then a sorrow
Till the air is dark with anguish

Now oer all the dreary Northland
Mighty Peboan the Winter
Breathing on the lakes and rivers
Into stone had changed their waters
From his hair he shook the snowflakes
Till the plains were strewn with whiteness
One uninterrupted level
As if stooping the Creator
With his hand had smoothed them over

Through the forest wide and wailing
Roamed the hunter on his snowshoes
In the village worked the women
Pounded maize or dressed the deerskin
And the young men played together
On the ice the noisy ballplay
On the plain the dance of snowshoes

One dark evening after sundown
In her wigwam Laughing Water
Sat with old Nokomis waiting
For the steps of Hiawatha
Homeward from the hunt returning

On their faces gleamed the firelight
Painting them with streaks of crimson
In the eyes of old Nokomis
Glimmered like the watery moonlight
In the eyes of Laughing Water
Glistened like the sun in water
And behind them crouched their shadows
In the corners of the wigwam
And the smoke in wreaths above them
Climbed and crowded through the smokeflue

Then the curtain of the doorway
From without was slowly lifted
Brighter glowed the fire a moment
And a moment swerved the smokewreath
As two women entered softly
Passed the doorway uninvited
Without word of salutation
Without sign of recognition
Sat down in the farthest corner
Crouching low among the shadows

From their aspect and their garments
Strangers seemed they in the village
Very pale and haggard were they
As they sat there sad and silent
Trembling cowering with the shadows

Was it the wind above the smokeflue
Muttering down into the wigwam
Was it the owl the Kokokoho
Hooting from the dismal forest
Sure a voice said in the silence
These are corpses clad in garments
These are ghosts that come to haunt you
From the kingdom of Ponemah
From the land of the Hereafter

Homeward now came Hiawatha
From his hunting in the forest
With the snow upon his tresses
And the red deer on his shoulders
At the feet of Laughing Water
Down he threw his lifeless burden
Nobler handsomer she thought him
Than when first he came to woo her
First threw down the deer before her
As a token of his wishes
As a promise of the future

Then he turned and saw the strangers
Cowering crouching with the shadows
Said within himself Who are they
What strange guests has Minnehaha
But he questioned not the strangers
Only spake to bid them welcome
To his lodge his food his fireside

When the evening meal was ready
And the deer had been divided
Both the pallid guests the strangers
Springing from among the shadows
Seized upon the choicest portions
Seized the white fat of the roebuck
Set apart for Laughing Water
For the wife of Hiawatha
Without asking without thanking
Eagerly devoured the morsels
Flitted back among the shadows
In the corner of the wigwam

Not a word spake Hiawatha
Not a motion made Nokomis
Not a gesture Laughing Water
Not a change came oer their features
Only Minnehaha softly
Whispered saying They are famished
Let them do what best delights them
Let them eat for they are famished

Many a daylight dawned and darkened
Many a night shook off the daylight
As the pine shakes off the snowflakes
From the midnight of its branches
Day by day the guests unmoving
Sat there silent in the wigwam
But by night in storm or starlight
Forth they went into the forest
Bringing firewood to the wigwam
Bringing pinecones for the burning
Always sad and always silent

And whenever Hiawatha
Came from fishing or from hunting
When the evening meal was ready
And the food had been divided
Gliding from their darksome corner
Came the pallid guests the strangers
Seized upon the choicest portions
Set aside for Laughing Water
And without rebuke or question
Flitted back among the shadows

Never once had Hiawatha
By a word or look reproved them
Never once had old Nokomis
Made a gesture of impatience
Never once had Laughing Water
Shown resentment at the outrage
All had they endured in silence
That the rights of guest and stranger
That the virtue of freegiving
By a look might not be lessened
By a word might not be broken

Once at midnight Hiawatha
Ever wakeful ever watchful
In the wigwam dimly lighted
By the brands that still were burning
By the glimmering flickering firelight
Heard a sighing oft repeated

From his couch rose Hiawatha
From his shaggy hides of bison
Pushed aside the deerskin curtain
Saw the pallid guests the shadows
Sitting upright on their couches
Weeping in the silent midnight

And he said O guests why is it
That your hearts are so afflicted
That you sob so in the midnight
Has perchance the old Nokomis
Has my wife my Minnehaha
Wronged or grieved you by unkindness
Failed in hospitable duties

Then the shadows ceased from weeping
Ceased from sobbing and lamenting
And they said with gentle voices
We are ghosts of the departed
Souls of those who once were with you
From the realms of Chibiabos
Hither have we come to try you
Hither have we come to warn you

Cries of grief and lamentation
Reach us in the Blessed Islands
Cries of anguish from the living
Calling back their friends departed
Sadden us with useless sorrow
Therefore have we come to try you
No one knows us no one heeds us
We are but a burden to you
And we see that the departed
Have no place among the living

Think of this O Hiawatha
Speak of it to all the people
That henceforward and forever
They no more with lamentations
Sadden the souls of the departed
In the Islands of the Blessed

Do not lay such heavy burdens
In the graves of those you bury
Not such weight of furs and wampum
Not such weight of pots and kettles
For the spirits faint beneath them
Only give them food to carry
Only give them fire to light them

Four days is the spirits journey
To the land of ghosts and shadows
Four its lonely night encampments
Four times must their fires be lighted
Therefore when the dead are buried
Let a fire as night approaches
Four times on the grave be kindled
That the soul upon its journey
May not lack the cheerful firelight
May not grope about in darkness

Farewell noble Hiawatha
We have put you to the trial
To the proof have put your patience
By the insult of our presence
By the outrage of our actions
We have found you great and noble
Fail not in the greater trial
Faint not in the harder struggle

When they ceased a sudden darkness
Fell and filled the silent wigwam
Hiawatha heard a rustle
As of garments trailing by him
Heard the curtain of the doorway
Lifted by a hand he saw not
Felt the cold breath of the night air
For a moment saw the starlight
But he saw the ghosts no longer
Saw no more the wandering spirits
From the kingdom of Ponemah
From the land of the Hereafter



 XX

 The Famine

Oh the long and dreary Winter
Oh the cold and cruel Winter
Ever thicker thicker thicker
Froze the ice on lake and river
Ever deeper deeper deeper
Fell the snow oer all the landscape
Fell the covering snow and drifted
Through the forest round the village
Hardly from his buried wigwam
Could the hunter force a passage
With his mittens and his snowshoes
Vainly walked he through the forest
Sought for bird or beast and found none
Saw no track of deer or rabbit
In the snow beheld no footprints
In the ghastly gleaming forest
Fell and could not rise from weakness
Perished there from cold and hunger

Oh the famine and the fever
Oh the wasting of the famine
Oh the blasting of the fever
Oh the wailing of the children
Oh the anguish of the women

All the earth was sick and famished
Hungry was the air around them
Hungry was the sky above them
And the hungry stars in heaven
Like the eyes of wolves glared at them

Into Hiawathas wigwam
Came two other guests as silent
As the ghosts were and as gloomy
Waited not to be invited
Did not parley at the doorway
Sat there without word of welcome
In the seat of Laughing Water
Looked with haggard eyes and hollow
At the face of Laughing Water

And the foremost said Behold me
I am Famine Bukadawin
And the other said Behold me
I am Fever Ahkosewin

And the lovely Minnehaha
Shuddered as they looked upon her
Shuddered at the words they uttered
Lay down on her bed in silence
Hid her face but made no answer
Lay there trembling freezing burning
At the looks they cast upon her
At the fearful words they uttered

Forth into the empty forest
Rushed the maddened Hiawatha
In his heart was deadly sorrow
In his face a stony firmness
On his brow the sweat of anguish
Started but it froze and fell not

Wrapped in furs and armed for hunting
With his mighty bow of ashtree
With his quiver full of arrows
With his mittens Minjekahwun
Into the vast and vacant forest
On his snowshoes strode he forward

Gitche Manito the Mighty
Cried he with his face uplifted
In that bitter hour of anguish
Give your children food O father
Give us food or we must perish
Give me food for Minnehaha
For my dying Minnehaha

Through the farresounding forest
Through the forest vast and vacant
Rang that cry of desolation
But there came no other answer
Than the echo of his crying
Than the echo of the woodlands
Minnehaha Minnehaha

All day long roved Hiawatha
In that melancholy forest
Through the shadow of whose thickets
In the pleasant days of Summer
Of that neer forgotten Summer
He had brought his young wife homeward
From the land of the Dacotahs
When the birds sang in the thickets
And the streamlets laughed and glistened
And the air was full of fragrance
And the lovely Laughing Water
Said with voice that did not tremble
I will follow you my husband

In the wigwam with Nokomis
With those gloomy guests that watched her
With the Famine and the Fever
She was lying the Beloved
She the dying Minnehaha

Hark she said I hear a rushing
Hear a roaring and a rushing
Hear the Falls of Minnehaha
Calling to me from a distance
No my child said old Nokomis
T is the nightwind in the pinetrees
Look she said I see my father
Standing lonely at his doorway
Beckoning to me from his wigwam
In the land of the Dacotahs
No my child said old Nokomis
T is the smoke that waves and beckons
Ah said she the eyes of Pauguk
Glare upon me in the darkness
I can feel his icy fingers
Clasping mine amid the darkness
Hiawatha Hiawatha

And the desolate Hiawatha
Far away amid the forest
Miles away among the mountains
Heard that sudden cry of anguish
Heard the voice of Minnehaha
Calling to him in the darkness
Hiawatha Hiawatha

Over snowfields waste and pathless
Under snowencumbered branches
Homeward hurried Hiawatha
Emptyhanded heavyhearted
Heard Nokomis moaning wailing
Wahonowin Wahonowin
Would that I had perished for you
Would that I were dead as you are
Wahonowin Wahonowin

And he rushed into the wigwam
Saw the old Nokomis slowly
Rocking to and fro and moaning
Saw his lovely Minnehaha
Lying dead and cold before him
And his bursting heart within him
Uttered such a cry of anguish
That the forest moaned and shuddered
That the very stars in heaven
Shook and trembled with his anguish

Then he sat down still and speechless
On the bed of Minnehaha
At the feet of Laughing Water
At those willing feet that never
More would lightly run to meet him
Never more would lightly follow

With both hands his face he covered
Seven long days and nights he sat there
As if in a swoon he sat there
Speechless motionless unconscious
Of the daylight or the darkness

Then they buried Minnehaha
In the snow a grave they made her
In the forest deep and darksome
Underneath the moaning hemlocks
Clothed her in her richest garments
Wrapped her in her robes of ermine
Covered her with snow like ermine
Thus they buried Minnehaha

And at night a fire was lighted
On her grave four times was kindled
For her soul upon its journey
To the Islands of the Blessed
From his doorway Hiawatha
Saw it burning in the forest
Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks
From his sleepless bed uprising
From the bed of Minnehaha
Stood and watched it at the doorway
That it might not be extinguished

Might not leave her in the darkness
Farewell said he Minnehaha
Farewell O my Laughing Water
All my heart is buried with you
All my thoughts go onward with you
Come not back again to labor
Come not back again to suffer
Where the Famine and the Fever
Wear the heart and waste the body
Soon my task will be completed
Soon your footsteps I shall follow
To the Islands of the Blessed
To the Kingdom of Ponemah
To the Land of the Hereafter

 The White Mans Foot

In his lodge beside a river
Close beside a frozen river
Sat an old man sad and lonely
White his hair was as a snowdrift
Dull and low his fire was burning
And the old man shook and trembled
Folded in his Waubewyon
In his tattered whiteskinwrapper
Hearing nothing but the tempest
As it roared along the forest
Seeing nothing but the snowstorm
As it whirled and hissed and drifted

All the coals were white with ashes
And the fire was slowly dying
As a young man walking lightly
At the open doorway entered
Red with blood of youth his cheeks were
Soft his eyes as stars in Springtime
Bound his forehead was with grasses
Bound and plumed with scented grasses
On his lips a smile of beauty
Filling all the lodge with sunshine
In his hand a bunch of blossoms
Filling all the lodge with sweetness

Ah my son exclaimed the old man
Happy are my eyes to see you
Sit here on the mat beside me
Sit here by the dying embers
Let us pass the night together
Tell me of your strange adventures
Of the lands where you have travelled
I will tell you of my prowess
Of my many deeds of wonder

From his pouch he drew his peacepipe
Very old and strangely fashioned
Made of red stone was the pipehead
And the stem a reed with feathers
Filled the pipe with bark of willow
Placed a burning coal upon it
Gave it to his guest the stranger
And began to speak in this wise
When I blow my breath about me
When I breathe upon the landscape
Motionless are all the rivers
Hard as stone becomes the water

And the young man answered smiling
When I blow my breath about me
When I breathe upon the landscape
Flowers spring up oer all the meadows
Singing onward rush the rivers

When I shake my hoary tresses
Said the old man darkly frowning
All the land with snow is covered
All the leaves from all the branches
Fall and fade and die and wither
For I breathe and lo they are not
From the waters and the marshes
Rise the wild goose and the heron
Fly away to distant regions
For I speak and lo they are not
And whereer my footsteps wander
All the wild beasts of the forest
Hide themselves in holes and caverns
And the earth becomes as flintstone

When I shake my flowing ringlets
Said the young man softly laughing
Showers of rain fall warm and welcome
Plants lift up their heads rejoicing
Back unto their lakes and marshes
Come the wild goose and the heron
Homeward shoots the arrowy swallow
Sing the bluebird and the robin
And whereer my footsteps wander
All the meadows wave with blossoms
All the woodlands ring with music
All the trees are dark with foliage

While they spake the night departed
From the distant realms of Wabun
From his shining lodge of silver
Like a warrior robed and painted
Came the sun and said Behold me
Gheezis the great sun behold me

Then the old mans tongue was speechless
And the air grew warm and pleasant
And upon the wigwam sweetly
Sang the bluebird and the robin
And the stream began to murmur
And a scent of growing grasses
Through the lodge was gently wafted

And Segwun the youthful stranger
More distinctly in the daylight
Saw the icy face before him
It was Peboan the Winter

From his eyes the tears were flowing
As from melting lakes the streamlets
And his body shrunk and dwindled
As the shouting sun ascended
Till into the air it faded
Till into the ground it vanished
And the young man saw before him
On the hearthstone of the wigwam
Where the fire had smoked and smouldered
Saw the earliest flower of Springtime
Saw the Beauty of the Springtime
Saw the Miskodeed in blossom

Thus it was that in the Northland
After that unheardof coldness
That intolerable Winter
Came the Spring with all its splendor
All its birds and all its blossoms
All its flowers and leaves and grasses

Sailing on the wind to northward
Flying in great flocks like arrows
Like huge arrows shot through heaven
Passed the swan the Mahnahbezee
Speaking almost as a man speaks
And in long lines waving bending
Like a bowstring snapped asunder
Came the white goose Wawbewawa
And in pairs or singly flying
Mahng the loon with clangorous pinions
The blue heron the Shuhshuhgah
And the grouse the Mushkodasa

In the thickets and the meadows
Piped the bluebird the Owaissa
On the summit of the lodges
Sang the robin the Opechee
In the covert of the pinetrees
Cooed the pigeon the Omemee
And the sorrowing Hiawatha
Speechless in his infinite sorrow
Heard their voices calling to him
Went forth from his gloomy doorway
Stood and gazed into the heaven
Gazed upon the earth and waters

From his wanderings far to eastward
From the regions of the morning
From the shining land of Wabun
Homeward now returned Iagoo
The great traveller the great boaster
Full of new and strange adventures
Marvels many and many wonders

And the people of the village
Listened to him as he told them
Of his marvellous adventures
Laughing answered him in this wise
Ugh it is indeed Iagoo
No one else beholds such wonders

He had seen he said a water
Bigger than the BigSeaWater
Broader than the Gitche Gumee
Bitter so that none could drink it
At each other looked the warriors
Looked the women at each other
Smiled and said It cannot be so
Kaw they said it cannot be so

Oer it said he oer this water
Came a great canoe with pinions
A canoe with wings came flying
Bigger than a grove of pinetrees
Taller than the tallest treetops
And the old men and the women
Looked and tittered at each other
Kaw they said we dont believe it

From its mouth he said to greet him
Came Waywassimo the lightning
Came the thunder Annemeekee
And the warriors and the women
Laughed aloud at poor Iagoo
Kaw they said what tales you tell us

In it said he came a people
In the great canoe with pinions
Came he said a hundred warriors
Painted white were all their faces
And with hair their chins were covered
And the warriors and the women
Laughed and shouted in derision
Like the ravens on the treetops
Like the crows upon the hemlocks
Kaw they said what lies you tell us
Do not think that we believe them

Only Hiawatha laughed not
But he gravely spake and answered
To their jeering and their jesting
True is all Iagoo tells us
I have seen it in a vision
Seen the great canoe with pinions
Seen the people with white faces
Seen the coming of this bearded
People of the wooden vessel
From the regions of the morning
From the shining land of Wabun

Gitche Manito the Mighty
The Great Spirit the Creator
Sends them hither on his errand
Sends them to us with his message
Wheresoeer they move before them
Swarms the stinging fly the Ahmo
Swarms the bee the honeymaker
Wheresoeer they tread beneath them
Springs a flower unknown among us
Springs the Whitemans Foot in blossom

Let us welcome then the strangers
Hail them as our friends and brothers
And the hearts right hand of friendship
Give them when they come to see us
Gitche Manito the Mighty
Said this to me in my vision

I beheld too in that vision
All the secrets of the future
Of the distant days that shall be
I beheld the westward marches
Of the unknown crowded nations
All the land was full of people
Restless struggling toiling striving
Speaking many tongues yet feeling
But one heartbeat in their bosoms
In the woodlands rang their axes
Smoked their towns in all the valleys
Over all the lakes and rivers
Rushed their great canoes of thunder

Then a darker drearier vision
Passed before me vague and cloudlike
I beheld our nation scattered
All forgetful of my counsels
Weakened warring with each other
Saw the remnants of our people
Sweeping westward wild and woful
Like the cloudrack of a tempest
Like the withered leaves of Autumn



 XXII

 Hiawathas Departure

By the shore of Gitche Gumee
By the shining BigSeaWater
At the doorway of his wigwam
In the pleasant Summer morning
Hiawatha stood and waited
All the air was full of freshness
All the earth was bright and joyous
And before him through the sunshine
Westward toward the neighboring forest
Passed in golden swarms the Ahmo
Passed the bees the honeymakers
Burning singing in the sunshine

Bright above him shone the heavens
Level spread the lake before him
From its bosom leaped the sturgeon
Sparkling flashing in the sunshine
On its margin the great forest
Stood reflected in the water
Every treetop had its shadow
Motionless beneath the water

From the brow of Hiawatha
Gone was every trace of sorrow
As the fog from off the water
As the mist from off the meadow
With a smile of joy and triumph
With a look of exultation
As of one who in a vision
Sees what is to be but is not
Stood and waited Hiawatha

Toward the sun his hands were lifted
Both the palms spread out against it
And between the parted fingers
Fell the sunshine on his features
Flecked with light his naked shoulders
As it falls and flecks an oaktree
Through the rifted leaves and branches

Oer the water floating flying
Something in the hazy distance
Something in the mists of morning
Loomed and lifted from the water
Now seemed floating now seemed flying
Coming nearer nearer nearer

Was it Shingebis the diver
Or the pelican the Shada
Or the heron the Shuhshuhgah
Or the white goose Wawbewawa
With the water dripping flashing
From its glossy neck and feathers

It was neither goose nor diver
Neither pelican nor heron
Oer the water floating flying
Through the shining mist of morning
But a birch canoe with paddles
Rising sinking on the water
Dripping flashing in the sunshine
And within it came a people
From the distant land of Wabun
From the farthest realms of morning
Came the BlackRobe chief the Prophet
He the Priest of Prayer the Paleface
With his guides and his companions

And the noble Hiawatha
With his hands aloft extended
Held aloft in sign of welcome
Waited full of exultation
Till the birch canoe with paddles
Grated on the shining pebbles
Stranded on the sandy margin
Till the BlackRobe chief the Paleface
With the cross upon his bosom
Landed on the sandy margin

Then the joyous Hiawatha
Cried aloud and spake in this wise
Beautiful is the sun O strangers
When you come so far to see us
All our town in peace awaits you
All our doors stand open for you
You shall enter all our wigwams
For the hearts right hand we give you

Never bloomed the earth so gayly
Never shone the sun so brightly
As today they shine and blossom
When you come so far to see us
Never was our lake so tranquil
Nor so free from rocks and sandbars
For your birch canoe in passing
Has removed both rock and sandbar

Never before had our tobacco
Such a sweet and pleasant flavor
Never the broad leaves of our cornfields
Were so beautiful to look on
As they seem to us this morning
When you come so far to see us

And the BlackRobe chief made answer
Stammered in his speech a little
Speaking words yet unfamiliar
Peace be with you Hiawatha
Peace be with you and your people
Peace of prayer and peace of pardon
Peace of Christ and joy of Mary

Then the generous Hiawatha
Led the strangers to his wigwam
Seated them on skins of bison
Seated them on skins of ermine
And the careful old Nokomis
Brought them food in bowls of basswood
Water brought in birchen dippers
And the calumet the peacepipe
Filled and lighted for their smoking

All the old men of the village
All the warriors of the nation
All the Jossakeeds the Prophets
The magicians the Wabenos
And the Medicinemen the Medas
Came to bid the strangers welcome
It is well they said O brothers
That you come so far to see us

In a circle round the doorway
With their pipes they sat in silence
Waiting to behold the strangers
Waiting to receive their message
Till the BlackRobe chief the Paleface
From the wigwam came to greet them
Stammering in his speech a little
Speaking words yet unfamiliar
It is well they said O brother
That you come so far to see us

Then the BlackRobe chief the Prophet
Told his message to the people
Told the purport of his mission
Told them of the Virgin Mary
And her blessed Son the Saviour
How in distant lands and ages
He had lived on earth as we do
How he fasted prayed and labored
How the Jews the tribe accursed
Mocked him scourged him crucified him
How he rose from where they laid him
Walked again with his disciples
And ascended into heaven

And the chiefs made answer saying
We have listened to your message
We have heard your words of wisdom
We will think on what you tell us
It is well for us O brothers
That you come so far to see us

Then they rose up and departed
Each one homeward to his wigwam
To the young men and the women
Told the story of the strangers
Whom the Master of Life had sent them
From the shining land of Wabun

Heavy with the heat and silence
Grew the afternoon of Summer
With a drowsy sound the forest
Whispered round the sultry wigwam
With a sound of sleep the water
Rippled on the beach below it
From the cornfields shrill and ceaseless
Sang the grasshopper Pahpukkeena
And the guests of Hiawatha
Weary with the heat of Summer
Slumbered in the sultry wigwam

Slowly oer the simmering landscape
Fell the evenings dusk and coolness
And the long and level sunbeams
Shot their spears into the forest
Breaking through its shields of shadow
Rushed into each secret ambush
Searched each thicket dingle hollow
Still the guests of Hiawatha
Slumbered in the silent wigwam

From his place rose Hiawatha
Bade farewell to old Nokomis
Spake in whispers spake in this wise
Did not wake the guests that slumbered

I am going O Nokomis
On a long and distant journey
To the portals of the Sunset
To the regions of the homewind
Of the NorthwestWind Keewaydin
But these guests I leave behind me
In your watch and ward I leave them
See that never harm comes near them
See that never fear molests them
Never danger nor suspicion
Never want of food or shelter
In the lodge of Hiawatha

Forth into the village went he
Bade farewell to all the warriors
Bade farewell to all the young men
Spake persuading spake in this wise

I am going O my people
On a long and distant journey
Many moons and many winters
Will have come and will have vanished
Ere I come again to see you
But my guests I leave behind me
Listen to their words of wisdom
Listen to the truth they tell you
For the Master of Life has sent them
From the land of light and morning

On the shore stood Hiawatha
Turned and waved his hand at parting
On the clear and luminous water
Launched his birch canoe for sailing
From the pebbles of the margin
Shoved it forth into the water
Whispered to it Westward westward
And with speed it darted forward

And the evening sun descending
Set the clouds on fire with redness
Burned the broad sky like a prairie
Left upon the level water
One long track and trail of splendor
Down whose stream as down a river
Westward westward Hiawatha
Sailed into the fiery sunset
Sailed into the purple vapors
Sailed into the dusk of evening

And the people from the margin
Watched him floating rising sinking
Till the birch canoe seemed lifted
High into that sea of splendor
Till it sank into the vapors
Like the new moon slowly slowly
Sinking in the purple distance

And they said Farewell forever
Said Farewell O Hiawatha
And the forests dark and lonely
Moved through all their depths of darkness
Sighed Farewell O Hiawatha
And the waves upon the margin
Rising rippling on the pebbles
Sobbed Farewell O Hiawatha
And the heron the Shuhshuhgah
From her haunts among the fenlands
Screamed Farewell O Hiawatha

Thus departed Hiawatha
Hiawatha the Beloved
In the glory of the sunset
In the purple mists of evening
To the regions of the homewind
Of the NorthwestWind Keewaydin
To the Islands of the Blessed
To the Kingdom of Ponemah
To the Land of the Hereafter
