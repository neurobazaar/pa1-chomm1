Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

SCENE Dispersedly in England and Wales



ACT 1

SCENE I London A Room in the palace

Enter KING RICHARD attended JOHN OF GAUNT with other NOBLES

KING RICHARD
Old John of Gaunt timehonoured Lancaster
Hast thou according to thy oath and band
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal
Which then our leisure would not let us hear
Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray

GAUNT
I have my liege

KING RICHARD
Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him
If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice
Or worthily as a good subject should
On some known ground of treachery in him

GAUNT
As near as I could sift him on that argument
On some apparent danger seen in him
Aimd at your Highness no inveterate malice

KING RICHARD
Then call them to our presence face to face
And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused freely speak
Highstomachd are they both and full of ire
In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire

Reenter Attendants with BOLINGBROKE and MOWBRAY

BOLINGBROKE
Many years of happy days befall
My gracious sovereign my most loving liege

MOWBRAY
Each day still better others happiness
Until the heavens envying earths good hap
Add an immortal title to your crown

KING RICHARD
We thank you both yet one but flatters us
As well appeareth by the cause you come
Namely to appeal each other of high treason
Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object
Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray

BOLINGBROKE
Firstheaven be the record to my speech
In the devotion of a subjects love
Tendering the precious safety of my prince
And free from other misbegotten hate
Come I appellant to this princely presence
Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee
And mark my greeting well for what I speak
My body shall make good upon this earth
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant
Too good to be so and too bad to live
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
Once more the more to aggravate the note
With a foul traitors name stuff I thy throat
And wish so please my sovereign ere I move
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove

MOWBRAY
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal
Tis not the trial of a womans war
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
The blood is hot that must be coold for this
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
As to be hushd and nought at all to say
First the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech
Which else would post until it had returnd
These terms of treason doubled down his throat
Setting aside his high bloods royalty
And let him be no kinsman to my liege
I do defy him and I spit at him
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain
Which to maintain I would allow him odds
And meet him were I tied to run afoot
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps
Or any other ground inhabitable
Wherever Englishman durst set his foot
Meantime let this defend my loyalty
By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie

BOLINGBROKE
Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king
And lay aside my high bloods royalty
Which fear not reverence makes thee to except
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
As to take up mine honours pawn then stoop
By that and all the rites of knighthood else
Will I make good against thee arm to arm
What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise

MOWBRAY
I take it up and by that sword I swear
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
Ill answer thee in any fair degree
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial
And when I mount alive may I not light
If I be traitor or unjustly fight

KING RICHARD
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbrays charge
It must be great that can inherit us
So much as of a thought of ill in him

BOLINGBROKE
Look what I speak my life shall prove it true
That Mowbray hath receivd eight thousand nobles
In name of lendings for your highness soldiers
The which he hath detaind for lewd employments
Like a false traitor and injurious villain
Besides I say and will in battle prove
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
That ever was surveyd by English eye
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this good
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucesters death
Suggest his soonbelieving adversaries
And consequently like a traitor coward
Sluicd out his innocent soul through streams of blood
Which blood like sacrificing Abels cries
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
To me for justice and rough chastisement
And by the glorious worth of my descent
This arm shall do it or this life be spent

KING RICHARD
How high a pitch his resolution soars
Thomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this

MOWBRAY
O let my sovereign turn away his face
And bid his ears a little while be deaf
Till I have told this slander of his blood
How God and good men hate so foul a liar

KING RICHARD
Mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears
Were he my brother nay my kingdoms heir
As he is but my fathers brothers son
Now by my sceptres awe I make a vow
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Should nothing privilege him nor partialize
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul
He is our subject Mowbray so art thou
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow

MOWBRAY
Then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Disbursd I duly to his highness soldiers
The other part reservd I by consent
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
Upon remainder of a dear account
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen
Now swallow down that lie For Gloucesters death
I slew him not but to my own disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty in that case
For you my noble Lord of Lancaster
The honourable father to my foe
Once did I lay an ambush for your life
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
But ere I last receivd the sacrament
I did confess it and exactly beggd
Your Graces pardon and I hope I had it
This is my fault as for the rest appeald
It issues from the rancour of a villain
A recreant and most degenerate traitor
Which in myself I boldly will defend
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Upon this overweening traitors foot
To prove myself a loyal gentleman
Even in the best blood chamberd in his bosom
In haste whereof most heartily I pray
Your highness to assign our trial day

KING RICHARD
Wrathkindled gentlemen be ruld by me
Lets purge this choler without letting blood
This we prescribe though no physician
Deep malice makes too deep incision
Forget forgive conclude and be agreed
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed
Good uncle let this end where it begun
Well calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son

GAUNT
To be a makepeace shall become my age
Throw down my son the Duke of Norfolks gage

KING RICHARD
And Norfolk throw down his

GAUNT
When Harry when
Obedience bids I should not bid again

KING RICHARD
Norfolk throw down we bid
There is no boot

MOWBRAY
Myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot
My life thou shalt command but not my shame
The one my duty owes but my fair name
Despite of death that lives upon my grave
To dark dishonours use thou shalt not have
I am disgracd impeachd and baffled here
Piercd to the soul with slanders venomd spear
The which no balm can cure but his heartblood
Which breathd this poison

KING RICHARD
Rage must be withstood
Give me his gage lions make leopards tame

MOWBRAY
Yea but not change his spots take but my shame
And I resign my gage My dear dear lord
The purest treasure mortal times afford
Is spotless reputation that away
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay
A jewel in a tentimes barrdup chest
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast
Mine honour is my life both grow in one
Take honour from me and my life is done
Then dear my liege mine honour let me try
In that I live and for that will I die

KING RICHARD
Cousin throw down your gage do you begin

BOLINGBROKE
O God defend my soul from such deep sin
Shall I seem crestfalln in my fathers sight
Or with pale beggarfear impeach my height
Before this outdard dastard Ere my tongue
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
Or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace
Where shame doth harbour even in Mowbrays face

Exit GAUNT

KING RICHARD
We were not born to sue but to command
Which since we cannot do to make you friends
Be ready as your lives shall answer it
At Coventry upon Saint Lamberts day
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
The swelling difference of your settled hate
Since we can not atone you we shall see
Justice design the victors chivalry
Lord Marshal command our officersatarms
Be ready to direct these home alarms

Exeunt



SCENE II The same A room in the DUKE OF LANCASTERS palace

Enter GAUNT and DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER

GAUNT
Alas the part I had in Woodstocks blood
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims
To stir against the butchers of his life
But since correction lieth in those hands
Which made the fault that we cannot correct
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven
Who when they see the hours ripe on earth
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads

DUCHESS
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire
Edwards seven sons whereof thyself art one
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood
Or seven fair branches springing from one root
Some of those seven are dried by natures course
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut
But Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucester
One vial full of Edwards sacred blood
One flourishing branch of his most royal root
Is crackd and all the precious liquor spilt
Is hackd down and his summer leaves all vaded
By envys hand and murders bloody axe
Ah Gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb
That metal that selfmould that fashiond thee
Made him a man and though thou livst and breathst
Yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent
In some large measure to thy fathers death
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die
Who was the model of thy fathers life
Call it not patience Gaunt it is despair
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughterd
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee
That which in mean men we entitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
What shall I say To safeguard thine own life
The best way is to venge my Gloucesters death

GAUNT
Gods is the quarrel for Gods substitute
His deputy anointed in his sight
Hath causd his death the which if wrongfully
Let heaven revenge for I may never lift
An angry arm against his minister

DUCHESS
Where then alas may I complain myself

GAUNT
To God the widows champion and defence

DUCHESS
Why then I will Farewell old Gaunt
Thou gost to Coventry there to behold
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight
O sit my husbands wrongs on Herefords spear
That it may enter butcher Mowbrays breast
Or if misfortune miss the first career
Be Mowbrays sins so heavy in his bosom
That they may break his foaming coursers back
And throw the rider headlong in the lists
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford
Farewell old Gaunt thy sometimes brothers wife
With her companion Grief must end her life

GAUNT
Sister farewell I must to Coventry
As much good stay with thee as go with me

DUCHESS
Yet one word more Grief boundeth where it falls
Not with the empty hollowness but weight
I take my leave before I have begun
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
Commend me to thy brother Edmund York
Lo this is all nay yet depart not so
Though this be all do not so quickly go
I shall remember more Bid himah what
With all good speed at Plashy visit me
Alack and what shall good old York there see
But empty lodgings and unfurnishd walls
Unpeopled offices untrodden stones
And what hear there for welcome but my groans
Therefore commend me let him not come there
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where
Desolate desolate will I hence and die
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye

Exeunt

And loving farewell of our several friends

MARSHAL

And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave

KING RICHARD Descends from his throne
We will descend and fold him in our arms
Cousin of Hereford as thy cause is right
So be thy fortune in this royal fight
Farewell my blood which if today thou shed
Lament we may but not revenge thee dead

BOLINGBROKE
O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me if I be gord with Mowbrays spear
As confident as is the falcons flight
Against a bird do I with Mowbray fight
My loving lord I take my leave of you
Of you my noble cousin Lord Aumerle
Not sick although I have to do with death
But lusty young and cheerly drawing breath
Lo as at English feasts so I regreet
The daintiest last to make the end most sweet
O thou the earthly author of my blood
Whose youthful spirit in me regenerate
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
To reach at victory above my head
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers
And with thy blessings steel my lances point
That it may enter Mowbrays waxen coat
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt
Even in the lusty haviour of his son

GAUNT
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous
Be swift like lightning in the execution
And let thy blows doubly redoubled
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy
Rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live

He takes his seat

MOWBRAY Rising
However God or fortune cast my lot
There lives or dies true to King Richards throne
A loyal just and upright gentleman
Never did captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
His golden uncontrolld enfranchisement
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
This feast of battle with mine adversary
Most mighty liege and my companion peers
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years
As gentle and as jocund as to jest
Go I to fight truth hath a quiet breast

KING RICHARD
Farewell my lord securely I espy
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye
Order the trial Marshal and begin

The KING and the Lords return to their seats

MARSHAL

BOLINGBROKE Rising
Strong as a tower in hope I cry amen

MARSHAL
To an officer Go bear this lance to Thomas
Duke of Norfolk

FIRST HERALD
Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
Stands here for God his sovereign and himself
On pain to be found false and recreant
To prove the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray
A traitor to his God his King and him
And dares him to set forward to the fight

SECOND HERALD
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk
On pain to be found false and recreant
Both to defend himself and to approve
Henry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
To God his sovereign and to him disloyal
Courageously and with a free desire
Attending but the signal to begin

MARSHAL
Sound trumpets and set forward combatants

A charge sounded

Stay the King hath thrown his warder down

KING RICHARD
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears
And both return back to their chairs again
Withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound
While we return these dukes what we decree

A long flourish

To the Combatants Draw near
And list what with our council we have done
For that our kingdoms earth should not be soild
With that dear blood which it hath fostered
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
Of civil wounds ploughd up with neighbours swords
And for we think the eaglewinged pride
Of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts
With rivalhating envy set on you
To wake our peace which in our countrys cradle
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep
Which so rousd up with boistrous untund drums
With harshresounding trumpets dreadful bray
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
And make us wade even in our kindreds blood
Therefore we banish you our territories
You cousin Hereford upon pain of life
Till twice five summers have enrichd our fields
Shall not regreet our fair dominions
But tread the stranger paths of banishment

BOLINGBROKE
Your will be done This must my comfort be
That sun that warms you here shall shine on me
And those his golden beams to you here lent
Shall point on me and gild my banishment

KING RICHARD
Norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce
The sly slow hours shall not determinate
The dateless limit of thy dear exile
The hopeless word of never to return
Breathe I against thee upon pain of life

MOWBRAY
A heavy sentence my most sovereign liege
And all unlookd for from your highness mouth
A dearer merit not so deep a maim
As to be cast forth in the common air
Have I deserved at your highness hands
The language I have learnd these forty years
My native English now I must forgo
And now my tongues use is to me no more
Than an unstringed viol or a harp
Or like a cunning instrument casd up
Or being open put into his hands
That knows no touch to tune the harmony
Within my mouth you have engaold my tongue
Doubly portcullisd with my teeth and lips
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
Is made my gaoler to attend on me
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse
Too far in years to be a pupil now
What is thy sentence then but speechless death
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath

KING RICHARD
It boots thee not to be compassionate
After our sentence plaining comes too late

MOWBRAY
Then thus I turn me from my countrys light
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night

Retiring

KING RICHARD
Return again and take an oath with thee
Lay on our royal sword your banishd hands
Swear by the duty that you owe to God
Our part therein we banish with yourselves
To keep the oath that we administer
You never shall so help you truth and God
Embrace each others love in banishment
Nor never look upon each others face
Nor never write regreet nor reconcile
This louring tempest of your homebred hate
Nor never by advised purpose meet
To plot contrive or complot any ill
Gainst us our state our subjects or our land

BOLINGBROKE
I swear

MOWBRAY
And I to keep all this

BOLINGBROKE
Norfolk so far as to mine enemy
By this time had the king permitted us
One of our souls had wandred in the air
Banishd this frail sepulchre of our flesh
As now our flesh is banishd from this land
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
Since thou hast far to go bear not along
The clogging burden of a guilty soul

MOWBRAY
No Bolingbroke if ever I were traitor
My name be blotted from the book of life
And I from heaven banishd as from hence
But what thou art God thou and I do know
And all too soon I fear the king shall rue
Farewell my liege Now no way can I stray
Save back to England all the worlds my way

Exit

KING RICHARD
Uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
I see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect
Hath from the number of his banishd years
Pluckd four awayTo BOLINGBROKE Six frozen winters spent
Return with welcome home from banishment

BOLINGBROKE
How long a time lies in one little word
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
End in a word such is the breath of kings

GAUNT
I thank my liege that in regard of me
He shortens four years of my sons exile
But little vantage shall I reap thereby
For ere the six years that he hath to spend
Can change their moons and bring their times about
My oildried lamp and timebewasted light
Shall be extinct with age and endless night
My inch of taper will be burnt and done
And blindfold death not let me see my son

KING RICHARD
Why uncle thou hast many years to live

GAUNT
But not a minute king that thou canst give
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
Thy word is current with him for my death
But dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath

KING RICHARD
Thy son is banishd upon good advice
Whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave
Why at our justice seemst thou then to lower

GAUNT
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
You urgd me as a judge but I had rather
You would have bid me argue like a father
O had it been a stranger not my child
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild
A partial slander sought I to avoid
And in the sentence my own life destroyd
Alas I lookd when some of you should say
I was too strict to make mine own away
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
Against my will to do myself this wrong

KING RICHARD
Cousin farewell and uncle bid him so
Six years we banish him and he shall go

Flourish Exit KING RICHARD and Train

AUMERLE
Cousin farewell what presence must not know
From where you do remain let paper show

MARSHAL
My lord no leave take I for I will ride
As far as land will let me by your side

GAUNT
O to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
That thou returnst no greeting to thy friends

BOLINGBROKE
I have too few to take my leave of you
When the tongues office should be prodigal
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart

GAUNT
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time

BOLINGBROKE
Joy absent grief is present for that time

GAUNT
What is six winters They are quickly gone

BOLINGBROKE
To men in joy but grief makes one hour ten

GAUNT
Call it a travel that thou takst for pleasure

BOLINGBROKE
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so
Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage

GAUNT
The sullen passage of thy weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
The precious jewel of thy home return

BOLINGBROKE
Nay rather every tedious stride I make
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewels that I love
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages and in the end
Having my freedom boast of nothing else
But that I was a journeyman to grief

GAUNT
All places that the eye of heaven visits
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens
Teach thy necessity to reason thus
There is no virtue like necessity
Think not the king did banish thee
But thou the king Woe doth the heavier sit
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne
Go say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
And not the King exild thee or suppose
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
And thou art flying to a fresher clime
Look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
To lie that way thou gost not whence thou comst
Suppose the singing birds musicians
The grass whereon thou treadst the presence strewd
The flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
Than a delightful measure or a dance
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
The man that mocks at it and sets it light

BOLINGBROKE
O who can hold a fire in his hand
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
By bare imagination of a feast
Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking on fantastic summers heat
O no the apprehension of the good
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse
Fell sorrows tooth doth never rankle more
Than when it bites but lanceth not the sore

GAUNT
Come come my son Ill bring thee on thy way
Had I thy youth and cause I would not stay

BOLINGBROKE
Then Englands ground farewell sweet soil adieu
My mother and my nurse that bears me yet
Whereer I wander boast of this I can
Though banishd yet a trueborn Englishman

Exeunt



SCENE IV London A Room in the Kings Castle

Enter KING RICHARD BAGOT and GREEN at one door
AUMERLE at another

KING RICHARD
We did observe Cousin Aumerle
How far brought you high Hereford on his way

AUMERLE
I brought high Hereford if you call him so
But to the next highway and there I left him

KING RICHARD
And say what store of parting tears were shed

AUMERLE
Faith none for me except the northeast wind
Which then blew bitterly against our faces
Awakd the sleeping rheum and so by chance
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear

KING RICHARD
What said our cousin when you parted with him

AUMERLE
Farewell
And for my heart disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the word that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
That words seemd buried in my sorrows grave
Marry would the word farewell have lengthend hours
And added years to his short banishment
He should have had a volume of farewells
But since it would not he had none of me

KING RICHARD
He is our cousin cousin but tis doubt
When time shall call him home from banishment
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends
Ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green
Observd his courtship to the common people
How he did seem to dive into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtesy
What reverence he did throw away on slaves
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of his fortune
As twere to banish their affects with him
Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee
With Thanks my countrymen my loving friends
As were our England in reversion his
And he our subjects next degree in hope

GREEN
Well he is gone and with him go these thoughts
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland
Expedient manage must be made my liege
Ere further leisure yield them further means
For their advantage and your highness loss

KING RICHARD
We will ourself in person to this war
And for our coffers with too great a court
And liberal largess are grown somewhat light
We are enforcd to farm our royal realm
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
For our affairs in hand If that come short
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters
Whereto when they shall know what men are rich
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
And send them after to supply our wants
For we will make for Ireland presently

Enter BUSHY

Bushy what news

BUSHY
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick my lord
Suddenly taken and hath sent postehaste
To entreat your Majesty to visit him

KING RICHARD
Where lies he

BUSHY
At Ely House

KING RICHARD
Now put it God in his physicians mind
To help him to his grave immediately
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars
Come gentlemen lets all go visit him
Pray God we may make haste and come too late

ALL Amen

Exeunt



ACT 2

SCENE I London An Apartment in Ely House

GAUNT on a couch the DUKE OF YORK and Others standing by him

GAUNT
Will the King come that I may breathe my last
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth

YORK
Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear

GAUNT
O but they say the tongues of dying men
Enforce attention like deep harmony
Where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain
He that no more must say is listend more
 Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
More are mens ends markd than their lives before
 The setting sun and music at the close
As the last taste of sweets is sweetest last
Writ in remembrance more than things long past
Though Richard my lifes counsel would not hear
My deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his ear

YORK
No it is stoppd with other flattering sounds
As praises of his state then there are fond
Lascivious metres to whose venom sound
The open ear of youth doth always listen
Report of fashions in proud Italy
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity
So it be new theres no respect how vile
That is not quickly buzzd into his ears
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard
Where will doth mutiny with wits regard
Direct not him whose way himself will choose
Tis breath thou lackst and that breath wilt thou lose

GAUNT
Methinks I am a prophet new inspird
And thus expiring do foretell of him
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
For violent fires soon burn out themselves
Small showers last long but sudden storms are short
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder
Light vanity insatiate cormorant
Consuming means soon preys upon itself
This royal throne of kings this scepterd isle
This earth of majesty this seat of Mars
This other Eden demiparadise
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war
This happy breed of men this little world
This precious stone set in the silver sea
Which serves it in the office of a wall
Or as a moat defensive to a house
Against the envy of less happier lands
This blessed plot this earth this realm this England
This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings
Feard by their breed and famous by their birth
Renowned for their deeds as far from home
For Christian service and true chivalry
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
Of the worlds ransom blessed Marys Son
This land of such dear souls this dear dear land
Dear for her reputation through the world
Is now leasd outI die pronouncing it
Like to a tenement or pelting farm
England bound in with the triumphant sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
Of watery Neptune is now bound in with shame
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds
That England that was wont to conquer others
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself
Ah would the scandal vanish with my life
How happy then were my ensuing death

Enter KING RICHARD and QUEEN AUMERLE BUSHY GREEN BAGOT
ROSS and WILLOUGHBY

YORK
The King is come deal mildly with his youth
For young hot colts being ragd do rage the more

QUEEN
How fares our noble uncle Lancaster

KING RICHARD
What comfort man How ist with aged Gaunt

GAUNT
O how that name befits my composition
Old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt
For sleeping England long time have I watchd
Watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon
Is my strict fast I mean my childrens looks
And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt
Gaunt am I for the grave gaunt as a grave
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones

KING RICHARD
Can sick men play so nicely with their names

GAUNT
No misery makes sport to mock itself
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
I mock my name great king to flatter thee

KING RICHARD
Should dying men flatter with those that live

GAUNT
No no men living flatter those that die

KING RICHARD
Thou now adying sayest thou flatterest me

GAUNT
O no thou diest though I the sicker be

KING RICHARD
I am in health I breathe and see thee ill

GAUNT
Now he that made me knows I see thee ill
Ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill
Thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick
And thou too careless patient as thou art
Committst thy anointed body to the cure
Of those physicians that first wounded thee
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head
And yet incaged in so small a verge
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land
O had thy grandsire with a prophets eye
Seen how his sons son should destroy his sons
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame
Deposing thee before thou wert possessd
Which art possessd now to depose thyself
Why cousin wert thou regent of the world
It were a shame to let this land by lease
But for thy world enjoying but this land
Is it not more than shame to shame it so
Landlord of England art thou now not king
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law
And

KING RICHARD
And thou a lunatic leanwitted fool
Presuming on an agues privilege
Darst with thy frozen admonition
Make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
With fury from his native residence
Now by my seats right royal majesty
Wert thou not brother to great Edwards son
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders

GAUNT
O spare me not my brother Edwards son
For that I was his father Edwards son
That blood already like the pelican
Hast thou tappd out and drunkenly carousd
My brother Gloucester plain wellmeaning soul
Whom fair befall in heaven mongst happy souls
May be a precedent and witness good
That thou respectst not spilling Edwards blood
Join with the present sickness that I have
And thy unkindness be like crooked age
To crop at once a toolong withered flower
Live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
These words hereafter thy tormentors be
Convey me to my bed then to my grave
Love they to live that love and honour have

Exit bourne out by his Attendants

KING RICHARD
And let them die that age and sullens have
For both hast thou and both become the grave

YORK
I do beseech your Majesty impute his words
To wayward sickliness and age in him
He loves you on my life and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Hereford were he here

KING RICHARD
Right you say true as Herefords love so his
As theirs so mine and all be as it is

Enter NORTHUMBERLAND

NORTHUMBERLAND
My liege old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty

KING RICHARD
What says he

NORTHUMBERLAND
Nay nothing all is said
His tongue is now a stringless instrument
Words life and all old Lancaster hath spent

YORK
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so
Though death be poor it ends a mortal woe

KING RICHARD
The ripest fruit first falls and so doth he
His time is spent our pilgrimage must be
So much for that Now for our Irish wars
We must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns
Which live like venom where no venom else
But only they have privilege to live
And for these great affairs do ask some charge
Towards our assistance we do seize to us
The plate coin revenues and moveables
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possessd

YORK How long shall I be patient Ah how long
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong
Not Gloucesters death nor Herefords banishment
Nor Gaunts rebukes nor Englands private wrongs
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
About his marriage nor my own disgrace
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereigns face
I am the last of noble Edwards sons
Of whom thy father Prince of Wales was first
In war was never lion ragd more fierce
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild
Than was that young and princely gentleman
His face thou hast for even so lookd he
Accomplishd with the number of thy hours
But when he frownd it was against the French
And not against his friends his noble hand
Did win what he did spend and spent not that
Which his triumphant fathers hand had won
His hands were guilty of no kindreds blood
But bloody with the enemies of his kin
O Richard York is too far gone with grief
Or else he never would compare between

KING RICHARD
Why uncle whats the matter

YORK
O my liege
Pardon me if you please if not I pleasd
Not to be pardond am content withal
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
The royalties and rights of banishd Hereford
Is not Gaunt dead and doth not Hereford live
Was not Gaunt just and is not Harry true
Did not the one deserve to have an heir
Is not his heir a welldeserving son
Take Herefords rights away and take from Time
His charters and his customary rights
Let not tomorrow then ensue today
Be not thyself for how art thou a king
But by fair sequence and succession
Now afore GodGod forbid I say true
If you do wrongfully seize Herefords rights
Call in the letterspatents that he hath
By his attorneysgeneral to sue
His livery and deny his offerd homage
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head
You lose a thousand welldisposed hearts
And prick my tender patience to those thoughts
Which honour and allegiance cannot think

KING RICHARD
Think what you will we seize into our hands
His plate his goods his money and his lands

YORK
Ill not be by the while my liege farewell
What will ensue hereof theres none can tell
But by bad courses may be understood
That their events can never fall out good

Exit

KING RICHARD
Go Bushy to the Earl of Wiltshire straight
Bid him repair to us to Ely House
To see this business Tomorrow next
We will for Ireland and tis time I trow
And we create in absence of ourself
Our Uncle York lord governor of England
For he is just and always lovd us well
Come on our queen tomorrow must we part
Be merry for our time of stay is short

Exeunt KING QUEEN BUSHY AUMERLE GREEN and BAGOT

NORTHUMBERLAND
Well lords the Duke of Lancaster is dead

ROSS
And living too for now his son is Duke

WILLOUGHBY
Barely in title not in revenues

NORTHUMBERLAND
Richly in both if justice had her right

ROSS
My heart is great but it must break with silence
Eret be disburdened with a liberal tongue

NORTHUMBERLAND
Nay speak thy mind and let him neer speak more
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm

WILLOUGHBY
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford
If it be so out with it boldly man
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him

ROSS
No good at all that I can do for him
Unless you call it good to pity him
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony

NORTHUMBERLAND
Now afore God tis shame such wrongs are borne
In him a royal prince and many moe
Of noble blood in this declining land
The king is not himself but basely led
By flatterers and what they will inform
Merely in hate gainst any of us all
That will the king severely prosecute
Gainst us our lives our children and our heirs

ROSS
The commons hath he pilld with grievous taxes
And quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he find
For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts

WILLOUGHBY
And daily new exactions are devisd
As blanks benevolences and I wot not what
But what o Gods name doth become of this

NORTHUMBERLAND
Wars hath not wasted it for warrd he hath not
But basely yielded upon compromise
That which his ancestors achievd with blows
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars

ROSS
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm

WILLOUGHBY
The Kings grown bankrupt like a broken man

NORTHUMBERLAND
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him

ROSS
He hath not money for these Irish wars
His burdenous taxations notwithstanding
But by the robbing of the banishd Duke

NORTHUMBERLAND
His noble kinsman most degenerate king
But lords we hear this fearful tempest sing
Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails
And yet we strike not but securely perish

ROSS
We see the very wrack that we must suffer
And unavoided is the danger now
For suffering so the causes of our wrack

NORTHUMBERLAND
Not so even through the hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering but I dare not say
How near the tidings of our comfort is

WILLOUGHBY
Nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours

ROSS
Be confident to speak Northumberland
We three are but thyself and speaking so
Thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold

NORTHUMBERLAND
Then thus I have from Le Port Blanc a bay
In Brittany receivd intelligence
That Harry Duke of Hereford Rainold Lord Cobham
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter
His brother Archbishop late of Canterbury
Sir Thomas Erpingham Sir John Ramston
Sir John Norbery Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint
All these well furnishd by the Duke of Britaine
With eight tall ships three thousand men of war
Are making hither with all due expedience
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore
Perhaps they had ere this but that they stay
The first departing of the king for Ireland
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
Imp out our drooping countrys broken wing
Redeem from broking pawn the blemishd crown
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptres gilt
And make high majesty look like itself
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh
But if you faint as fearing to do so
Stay and be secret and myself will go

ROSS
To horse to horse Urge doubts to them that fear

WILLOUGHBY
Hold out my horse and I will first be there

Exeunt



SCENE II The Same A Room in the Castle

Enter QUEEN BUSHY and BAGOT

BUSHY
Madam your Majesty is too much sad
You promisd when you parted with the king
To lay aside lifeharming heaviness
And entertain a cheerful disposition

QUEEN
To please the King I did to please myself
I cannot do it yet I know no cause
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
As my sweet Richard yet again methinks
Some unborn sorrow ripe in fortunes womb
Is coming towards me and my inward soul
With nothing trembles at some thing it grieves
More than with parting from my lord the king

BUSHY
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
Which shows like grief itself but is not so
For sorrows eye glazed with blinding tears
Divides one thing entire to many objects
Like perspectives which rightly gazd upon
Show nothing but confusion eyd awry
Distinguish form so your sweet Majesty
Looking awry upon your lords departure
Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail
Which lookd on as it is is nought but shadows
Of what it is not Then thricegracious Queen
More than your lords departure weep not mores not seen
Or if it be tis with false sorrows eye
Which for things true weeps things imaginary

QUEEN
It may be so but yet my inward soul
Persuades me it is otherwise howeer it be
I cannot but be sad so heavy sad
As though in thinking on no thought I think
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink

BUSHY
Tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady

QUEEN
Tis nothing less conceit is still derivd
From some forefather grief mine is not so
For nothing hath begot my something grief
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve
Tis in reversion that I do possess
But what it is that is not yet known what
I cannot name tis nameless woe I wot

Enter GREEN

GREEN
God save your majesty and well met gentlemen
I hope the King is not yet shippd for Ireland

QUEEN
Why hopst thou so Tis better hope he is
For his designs crave haste his haste good hope
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shippd

GREEN
That he our hope might have retird his power
And driven into despair an enemys hope
Who strongly hath set footing in this land
The banishd Bolingbroke repeals himself
And with uplifted arms is safe arrivd
At Ravenspurgh

QUEEN
Now God in heaven forbid

GREEN
Ah madam tis too true and that is worse
The Lord Northumberland his son young Henry Percy
The Lords of Ross Beaumond and Willoughby
With all their powerful friends are fled to him

BUSHY
Why have you not proclaimd Northumberland
And all the rest revolted faction traitors

GREEN
We have whereupon the Earl of Worcester
Hath broken his staff resignd his stewardship
And all the household servants fled with him
To Bolingbroke

QUEEN
So Green thou art the midwife to my woe
And Bolingbroke my sorrows dismal heir
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy
And I a gasping newdeliverd mother
Have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow joind

BUSHY
Despair not madam

QUEEN
Who shall hinder me
I will despair and be at enmity
With cozening hope he is a flatterer
A parasite a keeperback of death
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life
Which false hope lingers in extremity

Enter YORK

GREEN
Here comes the Duke of York

QUEEN
With signs of war about his aged neck
O full of careful business are his looks
Uncle for Gods sake speak comfortable words

YORK
Should I do so I should belie my thoughts
Comforts in heaven and we are on the earth
Where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief
Your husband he is gone to save far off
Whilst others come to make him lose at home
Here am I left to underprop his land
Who weak with age cannot support myself
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made
Now shall he try his friends that flatterd him

Enter a Servant

SERVANT
My lord your son was gone before I came

YORK
He was Why so go all which way it will
The nobles they are fled the commons they are cold
And will I fear revolt on Herefords side
Sirrah get thee to Plashy to my sister Gloucester
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound
Hold take my ring

SERVANT
My lord I had forgot to tell your lordship
Today as I came by I called there
But I shall grieve you to report the rest

YORK
What ist knave

SERVANT
An hour before I came the duchess died

YORK
God for his mercy what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once
I know not what to do I would to God
So my untruth had not provokd him to it
The king had cut off my head with my brothers
What are there no posts dispatchd for Ireland
How shall we do for money for these wars
Come sistercousin I would saypray pardon me
Go fellow get thee home provide some carts
And bring away the armour that is there

Exit Servant

Gentlemen will you go muster men
If I know how or which way to order these affairs
Thus disorderly thrust into my hands
Never believe me Both are my kinsmen
Tone is my sovereign whom both my oath
And duty bids defend the other again
Is my kinsman whom the king hath wrongd
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right
Well somewhat we must do Come cousin
Ill dispose of you Gentlemen go muster up your men
And meet me presently at Berkeley Castle
I should to Plashy too
But time will not permit All is uneven
And everything is left at six and seven

Exeunt YORK and QUEEN

BUSHY
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland
But none returns For us to levy power
Proportionable to the enemy
Is all unpossible

GREEN
Besides our nearness to the king in love
Is near the hate of those love not the king

BAGOT
And that is the wavering commons for their love
Lies in their purses and whoso empties them
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate

BUSHY
Wherein the king stands generally condemnd

BAGOT
If judgment lie in them then so do we
Because we ever have been near the king

GREEN
Well I will for refuge straight to Bristol Castle
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there

BUSHY
Thither will I with you for little office
Will the hateful commons perform for us
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces
Will you go along with us

BAGOT
No I will to Ireland to his Majesty
Farewell If hearts presages be not vain
We three here part that neer shall meet again

BUSHY
Thats as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke

GREEN
Alas poor Duke the task he undertakes
Is numbring sands and drinking oceans dry
Where one on his side fights thousands will fly
Farewell at once for once for all and ever

BUSHY
Well we may meet again

BAGOT
I fear me never

Exeunt



SCENE III The Wolds in Gloucestershire

Enter BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND with Forces

BOLINGBROKE
How far is it my lord to Berkeley now

NORTHUMBERLAND
Believe me noble lord
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
Making the hard way sweet and delectable
But I bethink me what a weary way
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
In Ross and Willoughby wanting your company
Which I protest hath very much beguild
The tediousness and process of my travel
But theirs is sweetend with the hope to have
The present benefit which I possess
And hope to joy is little less in joy
Than hope enjoyd by this the weary lords
Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done
By sight of what I have your noble company

BOLINGBROKE
Of much less value is my company
Than your good words But who comes here

Enter HARRY PERCY

NORTHUMBERLAND
It is my son young Harry Percy
Sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever
Harry how fares your uncle

PERCY
I had thought my lord to have learnd his health of you

NORTHUMBERLAND
Why is he not with the Queen

PERCY
No my good lord he hath forsook the court
Broken his staff of office and dispersd
The household of the King

NORTHUMBERLAND
What was his reason
He was not so resolvd when last we spake together

PERCY
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor
But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford
And sent me over by Berkeley to discover
What power the Duke of York had levied there
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh

NORTHUMBERLAND
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy

PERCY
No my good lord for that is not forgot
Which neer I did remember to my knowledge
I never in my life did look on him

NORTHUMBERLAND
Then learn to know him now this is the duke

PERCY
My gracious lord I tender you my service
Such as it is being tender raw and young
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved service and desert

BOLINGBROKE
I thank thee gentle Percy and be sure
I count myself in nothing else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good friends
And as my fortune ripens with thy love
It shall be still thy true loves recompense
My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it

NORTHUMBERLAND
How far is it to Berkeley And what stir
Keeps good old York there with his men of war

PERCY
There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees
Mannd with three hundred men as I have heard
And in it are the Lords of York Berkeley and Seymour
None else of name and noble estimate

Enter Ross and WILLOUGHBY

NORTHUMBERLAND
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby
Bloody with spurring fieryred with haste

BOLINGBROKE
Welcome my lords I wot your love pursues
A banishd traitor all my treasury
Is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrichd
Shall be your love and labours recompense

ROSS
Your presence makes us rich most noble lord

WILLOUGHBY
And far surmounts our labour to attain it

BOLINGBROKE
Evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor
Which till my infant fortune comes to years
Stands for my bounty But who comes here

Enter BERKELEY

NORTHUMBERLAND
It is my Lord of Berkeley as I guess

BERKELEY
My Lord of Hereford my message is to you

BOLINGBROKE
My lord my answer isto Lancaster
And I am come to seek that name in England
And I must find that title in your tongue
Before I make reply to aught you say

BERKELEY
Mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning
To raze one title of your honour out
To you my lord I come what lord you will
From the most gracious regent of this land
The Duke of York to know what pricks you on
To take advantage of the absent time
And fright our native peace with selfborne arms

Enter YORK attended

BOLINGBROKE
I shall not need transport my words by you
Here comes his Grace in person
 My noble uncle

Kneels

YORK
Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee
Whose duty is deceivable and false

BOLINGBROKE
My gracious uncle

YORK
Tut tut
Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle
I am no traitors uncle and that word grace
In an ungracious mouth is but profane
Why have those banishd and forbidden legs
Dard once to touch a dust of Englands ground
But then more why why have they dard to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom
Frighting her palefacd villages with war
And ostentation of despised arms
Comst thou because the anointed king is hence
Why foolish boy the king is left behind
And in my loyal bosom lies his power
Were I but now lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself
Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men
From forth the ranks of many thousand French
O then how quickly should this arm of mine
Now prisoner to the palsy chastise the
And minister correction to thy fault

BOLINGBROKE
My gracious uncle let me know my fault
On what condition stands it and wherein

YORK
Even in condition of the worst degree
In gross rebellion and detested treason
Thou art a banishd man and here art come
Before the expiration of thy time
In braving arms against thy sovereign

BOLINGBROKE
As I was banishd I was banishd Hereford
But as I come I come for Lancaster
And noble uncle I beseech your Grace
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye
You are my father for methinks in you
I see old Gaunt alive O then my father
Will you permit that I shall stand condemnd
A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
Pluckd from my arms perforce and given away
To upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born
If that my cousin king be King in England
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster
You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin
Had you first died and he been thus trod down
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
I am denied to sue my livery here
And yet my letterspatents give me leave
My fathers goods are all distraind and sold
And these and all are all amiss employd
What would you have me do I am a subject
And challenge law attorneys are denied me
And therefore personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent

NORTHUMBERLAND
The noble Duke hath been too much abusd

ROSS
It stands your Grace upon to do him right

WILLOUGHBY
Base men by his endowments are made great

YORK
My lords of England let me tell you this
I have had feeling of my cousins wrongs
And labourd all I could to do him right
But in this kind to come in braving arms
Be his own carver and cut out his way
To find out right with wrong it may not be
And you that do abet him in this kind
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all

NORTHUMBERLAND
The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own and for the right of that
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid
And let him never see joy that breaks that oath

YORK
Well well I see the issue of these arms
I cannot mend it I must needs confess
Because my power is weak and all ill left
But if I could by him that gave me life
I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king
But since I cannot be it known unto you
I do remain as neuter So fare you well
Unless you please to enter in the castle
And there repose you for this night

BOLINGBROKE
An offer uncle that we will accept
But we must win your Grace to go with us
To Bristol Castle which they say is held
By Bushy Bagot and their complices
The caterpillars of the commonwealth
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away

YORK
It may be I will go with you but yet Ill pause
For I am loath to break our countrys laws
Nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are
Things past redress are now with me past care

Exeunt



SCENE IV A camp in Wales

Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a CAPTAIN

CAPTAIN
My Lord of Salisbury we have stayd ten days
And hardly kept our countrymen together
And yet we hear no tidings from the King
Therefore we will disperse ourselves farewell

SALISBURY
Stay yet another day thou trusty Welshman
The King reposeth all his confidence in thee

CAPTAIN
Tis thought the king is dead we will not stay
The bay trees in our country are all witherd
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven
The palefacd moon looks bloody on the earth
And leanlookd prophets whisper fearful change
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy
The other to enjoy by rage and war
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings
Farewell our countrymen are gone and fled
As well assurd Richard their king is dead

Exit

SALISBURY
Ah Richard with the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy glory like a shooting star
Fall to the base earth from the firmament
The sun sets weeping in the lowly west
Witnessing storms to come woe and unrest
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes

Exit



ACT 3

SCENE I Bristol BOLINGBROKES camp

Enter BOLINGBROKE YORK NORTHUMBERLAND HENRY PERCY
WILLOUGHBY ROSS Officers behind with BUSHY and GREEN
prisoners

BOLINGBROKE
Bring forth these men
Bushy and Green I will not vex your souls
Since presently your souls must part your bodies
With too much urging your pernicious lives
For twere no charity yet to wash your blood
From off my hands here in the view of men
I will unfold some causes of your deaths
You have misled a prince a royal king
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments
By you unhappied and disfigurd clean
You have in manner with your sinful hours
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him
Broke the possession of a royal bed
And staind the beauty of a fair queens cheeks
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs
Myself a prince by fortune of my birth
Near to the King in blood and near in love
Till you did make him misinterpret me
Have stoopd my neck under your injuries
And sighd my English breath in foreign clouds
Eating the bitter bread of banishment
Whilst you have fed upon my signories
Disparkd my parks and felled my forest woods
From my own windows torn my household coat
Razd out my impress leaving me no sign
Save mens opinions and my living blood
To show the world I am a gentleman
This and much more much more than twice all this
Condemns you to the death See them deliverd over
To execution and the hand of death

BUSHY
More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to England Lords farewell

GREEN
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
And plague injustice with the pains of hell

BOLINGBROKE
My Lord Northumberland see them dispatchd

Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND and Others with BUSHY and GREEN

Uncle you say the Queen is at your house
For Gods sake fairly let her be entreated
Tell her I send to her my kind commends
Take special care my greetings be deliverd

YORK
A gentleman of mine I have dispatchd
With letters of your love to her at large

BOLINGBROKE
Thanks gentle uncle Come lords away
To fight with Glendower and his complices
Awhile to work and after holiday

Exeunt



SCENE II The coast of Wales A castle in view

Flourish drums and trumpets Enter KING RICHARD the BISHOP OF
CARLISLE AUMERLE and soldiers

KING RICHARD
Barkloughly Castle call they this at hand

AUMERLE
Yea my lord How brooks your Grace the air
After your late tossing on the breaking seas

KING RICHARD
Needs must I like it well I weep for joy
To stand upon my kingdom once again
Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand
Though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs
As a longparted mother with her child
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
So weepingsmiling greet I thee my earth
And do thee favours with my royal hands
Feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense
But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom
And heavygaited toads lie in their way
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
Which with usurping steps do trample thee
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
Guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies
Mock not my senseless conjuration lords
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers ere her native king
Shall falter under foul rebellions arms

CARLISLE
Fear not my lord that Power that made you king
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all
The means that heaven yields must be embracd
And not neglected else if heaven would
And we will not heavens offer we refuse
The profferd means of succour and redress

AUMERLE
He means my lord that we are too remiss
Whilst Bolingbroke through our security
Grows strong and great in substance and in friends

KING RICHARD
Discomfortable cousin knowst thou not
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid
Behind the globe that lights the lower world
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage boldly here
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light through every guilty hole
Then murders treasons and detested sins
The cloak of night being pluckd from off their backs
Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke
Who all this while hath revelld in the night
Whilst we were wandering with the Antipodes
Shall see us rising in our throne the east
His treasons will sit blushing in his face
Not able to endure the sight of day
But selfaffrighted tremble at his sin
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The deputy elected by the Lord
For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressd
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
A glorious angel then if angels fight
Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right

Enter SALISBURY

Welcome my lord How far off lies your power

SALISBURY
Nor near nor farther off my gracious lord
Than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue
And bids me speak of nothing but despair
One day too late I fear me noble lord
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth
O call back yesterday bid time return
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men
Today today unhappy day too late
Oerthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state
For all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead
Are gone to Bolingbroke dispersd and fled

AUMERLE
Comfort my liege why looks your Grace so pale

KING RICHARD
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face and they are fled
And till so much blood thither come again
Have I not reason to look pale and dead
All souls that will be safe fly from my side
For time hath set a blot upon my pride

AUMERLE
Comfort my liege remember who you are

KING RICHARD
I had forgot myself Am I not king
Awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest
Is not the kings name twenty thousand names
Arm arm my name a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory Look not to the ground
Ye favourites of a king are we not high
High be our thoughts I know my uncle York
Hath power enough to serve our turn But who comes here

Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP

SCROOP
More health and happiness betide my liege
Than can my caretund tongue deliver him

KING RICHARD
Mine ear is open and my heart prepard
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold
Say is my kingdom lost Why twas my care
And what loss is it to be rid of care
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we
Greater he shall not be if he serve God
Well serve him too and be his fellow so
Revolt our subjects That we cannot mend
They break their faith to God as well as us
Cry woe destruction ruin loss decay
The worst is death and death will have his day

SCROOP
Glad am I that your highness is so armd
To bear the tidings of calamity
Like an unseasonable stormy day
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
As if the world were all dissolvd to tears
So high above his limits swells the rage
Of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
Whitebeards have armd their thin and hairless scalps
Against thy majesty and boys with womens voices
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
Of doublefatal yew against thy state
Yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills
Against thy seat both young and old rebel
And all goes worse than I have power to tell

KING RICHARD
Too well too well thou tellst a tale so ill
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire Where is Bagot
What is become of Bushy Where is Green
That they have let the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps
If we prevail their heads shall pay for it
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke

SCROOP
Peace have they made with him indeed my lord

KING RICHARD
O villains vipers damnd without redemption
Dogs easily won to fawn on any man
Snakes in my heartblood warmd that sting my heart
Three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas
Would they make peace Terrible hell make war
Upon their spotted souls for this offence

SCROOP
Sweet love I see changing his property
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate
Again uncurse their souls their peace is made
With heads and not with hands those whom you curse
Have felt the worst of deaths destroying wound
And lie full low gravd in the hollow ground

AUMERLE
Is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead

SCROOP
Ay all of them at Bristol lost their heads

AUMERLE
Where is the Duke my father with his power

KING RICHARD
No matter where Of comfort no man speak
Lets talk of graves of worms and epitaphs
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
Lets choose executors and talk of wills
And yet not sofor what can we bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the ground
Our lands our lives and all are Bolingbrokes
And nothing can we can our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones
For Gods sake let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings
How some have been deposed some slain in war
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposd
Some poisond by their wives some sleeping killd
All murderd for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court and there the antick sits
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
Allowing him a breath a little scene
To monarchize be feard and kill with looks
Infusing him with self and vain conceit
As if this flesh which walls about our life
Were brass impregnable and humourd thus
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall and farewell king
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence throw away respect
Tradition form and ceremonious duty
For you have but mistook me all this while
I live with bread like you feel want
Taste grief need friends subjected thus
How can you say to me I am a king

CARLISLE
My lord wise men neer sit and wail their woes
But presently prevent the ways to wail
To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe
And so your follies fight against yourself
Fear and be slain no worse can come to fight
And fight and die is death destroying death
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath

AUMERLE
My father hath a power inquire of him
And learn to make a body of a limb

KING RICHARD
Thou chidst me well Proud Bolingbroke I come
To change blows with thee for our day of doom
This ague fit of fear is overblown
An easy task it is to win our own
Say Scroop where lies our uncle with his power
Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour

SCROOP
Men judge by the complexion of the sky
 The state in inclination of the day
So may you by my dull and heavy eye
 My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
I play the torturer by small and small
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken
Your uncle York is joind with Bolingbroke
And all your northern castles yielded up
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party

KING RICHARD
Thou hast said enough
To AUMERLE Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
Of that sweet way I was in to despair
What say you now What comfort have we now
By heaven Ill hate him everlastingly
That bids me be of comfort any more
Go to Flint Castle there Ill pine away
A king woes slave shall kingly woe obey
That power I have discharge and let them go
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow
For I have none Let no man speak again
To alter this for counsel is but vain

AUMERLE
My liege one word

KING RICHARD
He does me double wrong
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
Discharge my followers let them hence away
From Richards night to Bolingbrokes fair day

Exeunt



SCENE III Wales Before Flint Castle

Enter with drum and colours BOLINGBROKE and Forces YORK
NORTHUMBERLAND and Others

BOLINGBROKE
So that by this intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are dispersd and Salisbury
Is gone to meet the king who lately landed
With some few private friends upon this coast

NORTHUMBERLAND
The news is very fair and good my lord
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head

YORK
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
To say King Richard alack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should hide his head

NORTHUMBERLAND
Your Grace mistakes only to be brief
Left I his title out

YORK
The time hath been
Would you have been so brief with him he would
Have been so brief with you to shorten you
For taking so the head your whole heads length

BOLINGBROKE
Mistake not uncle further than you should

YORK
Take not good cousin further than you should
Lest you mistake The heavens are oer our heads

BOLINGBROKE
I know it uncle and oppose not myself
Against their will But who comes here

Enter HENRY PERCY

Welcome Harry what will not this castle yield

PERCY
The castle royally is mannd my lord
Against thy entrance

BOLINGBROKE
Royally
Why it contains no king

PERCY
Yes my good lord
It doth contain a king King Richard lies
Within the limits of yon lime and stone
And with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury
Sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence who I cannot learn

NORTHUMBERLAND
O belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle

BOLINGBROKE
To NORTHUMBERLAND Noble lord
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Into his ruind ears and thus deliver
Henry Bolingbroke
On both his knees doth kiss King Richards hand
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
To his most royal person hither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power
Provided that my banishment repeald
And lands restord again be freely granted
If not Ill use the advantage of my power
And lay the summers dust with showers of blood
Raind from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen
The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
It is such crimson tempest should bedrench
The fresh green lap of fair King Richards land
My stooping duty tenderly shall show
Go signify as much while here we march
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain
Lets march without the noise of threatning drum
That from this castles totterd battlements
Our fair appointments may be well perusd
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
With no less terror than the elements
Of fire and water when their thundring shock
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
Be he the fire Ill be the yielding water
The rage be his whilst on the earth I rain
My waters on the earth and not on him
March on and mark King Richard how he looks

A Parley sounded and answered by a Trumpet within
Flourish Enter on the Walls the KING the BISHOP OF CARLISLE
AUMERLE SCROOP and SALISBURY

HENRY PERCY
See see King Richard doth himself appear
As doth the blushing discontented sun
From out the fiery portal of the east
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
To dim his glory and to stain the track
Of his bright passage to the occident

YORK
Yet he looks like a king behold his eye
As bright as is the eagles lightens forth
Controlling majesty alack alack for woe
That any harm should stain so fair a show

KING RICHARD
To NORTHUMBERLAND We are amazd and thus long
have we stood
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king
And if we be how dare thy joints forget
To pay their awful duty to our presence
If we be not show us the hand of God
That hath dismissd us from our stewardship
For well we know no hand of blood and bone
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
Unless he do profane steal or usurp
And though you think that all as you have done
Have torn their souls by turning them from us
And we are barren and bereft of friends
Yet knowmy master God omnipotent
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
Armies of pestilence and they shall strike
Your children yet unborn and unbegot
That lift your vassal hands against my head
And threat the glory of my precious crown
Tell Bolingbrokefor yond methinks he stands
That every stride he makes upon my land
Is dangerous treason he is come to open
The purple testament of bleeding war
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons
Shall ill become the flower of Englands face
Change the complexion of her maidpale peace
To scarlet indignation and bedew
Her pastures grass with faithful English blood

NORTHUMBERLAND
The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
Be rushd upon Thy thrice noble cousin
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand
And by the honourable tomb he swears
That stands upon your royal grandsires bones
And by the royalties of both your bloods
Currents that spring from one most gracious head
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt
And by the worth and honour of himself
Comprising all that may be sworn or said
His coming hither hath no further scope
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees
Which on thy royal party granted once
His glittering arms he will commend to rust
His barbed steeds to stables and his heart
To faithful service of your Majesty
This swears he as he is a prince is just
And as I am a gentleman I credit him

KING RICHARD
Northumberland say thus the king returns
His noble cousin is right welcome hither
And all the number of his fair demands
Shall be accomplishd without contradiction
With all the gracious utterance thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends

NORTHUMBERLAND retires to BOLINGBROKE

To AUMERLE We do debase ourselves cousin do we not
To look so poorly and to speak so fair
Shall we call back Northumberland and send
Defiance to the traitor and so die

AUMERLE
No good my lord lets fight with gentle words
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords

KING RICHARD
O God O God that eer this tongue of mine
That laid the sentence of dread banishment
On yond proud man should take it off again
With words of sooth O that I were as great
As is my grief or lesser than my name
Or that I could forget what I have been
Or not remember what I must be now
Swellst thou proud heart Ill give thee scope to beat
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me

AUMERLE
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke

KING RICHARD
What must the King do now Must he submit
The king shall do it must he be deposd
The king shall be contented must he lose
The name of king A Gods name let it go
Ill give my jewels for a set of beads
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage
My gay apparel for an almsmans gown
My figurd goblets for a dish of wood
My sceptre for a palmers walkingstaff
My subjects for a pair of carved saints
And my large kingdom for a little grave
A little little grave an obscure grave
Or Ill be buried in the kings highway
Some way of common trade where subjects feet
May hourly trample on their sovereigns head
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live
And buried once why not upon my head
Aumerle thou weepst my tenderhearted cousin
Well make foul weather with despised tears
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
And make a dearth in this revolting land
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes
And make some pretty match with shedding tears
As thus to drop them still upon one place
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
Within the earth and there inlaid There lies
Two kinsmen diggd their graves with weeping eyes
Would not this ill do well Well well I see
I talk but idly and you laugh at me
Most mighty prince my Lord Northumberland
What says King Bolingbroke will his Majesty
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die
You make a leg and Bolingbroke says ay

NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord in the base court he doth attend
To speak with you may it please you to come down

KING RICHARD
Down down I come like glistring Phaethon
Wanting the manage of unruly jades
In the base court Base court where kings grow base
To come at traitors calls and do them grace
In the base court Come down Down court down king
For nightowls shriek where mounting larks should sing

Exeunt from above

BOLINGBROKE
What says his Majesty

NORTHUMBERLAND
Sorrow and grief of heart
Makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
Yet he is come

Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants

BOLINGBROKE
Stand all apart
And show fair duty to his MajestyKneeling
My gracious lord

KING RICHARD
Fair cousin you debase your princely knee
To make the base earth proud with kissing it
Me rather had my heart might feel your love
Than my unpleasd eye see your courtesy
Up cousin up your heart is up I know
Thus high at least although your knee be low

BOLINGBROKE
My gracious lord I come but for mine own

KING RICHARD
Your own is yours and I am yours and all

BOLINGBROKE
So far be mine my most redoubted lord
As my true service shall deserve your love

KING RICHARD
Well you deserve they well deserve to have
That know the strongst and surest way to get
Uncle give me your hand nay dry your eyes
Tears show their love but want their remedies
Cousin I am too young to be your father
Though you are old enough to be my heir
What you will have Ill give and willing too
For do we must what force will have us do
Set on towards London Cousin is it so

BOLINGBROKE
Yea my good lord

KING RICHARD
Then I must not say no

Flourish Exeunt



SCENE IV Langley The DUKE OF YORKs garden

Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies

QUEEN
What sport shall we devise here in this garden
To drive away the heavy thought of care

LADY
Madam well play at bowls

QUEEN
Twill make me think the world is full of rubs
And that my fortune runs against the bias

LADY
Madam well dance

QUEEN
My legs can keep no measure in delight
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief
Therefore no dancing girl some other sport

LADY
Madam well tell tales

QUEEN
Of sorrow or of joy

LADY
Of either madam

QUEEN
Of neither girl
For if of joy being altogether wanting
It doth remember me the more of sorrow
Or if of grief being altogether had
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy
For what I have I need not to repeat
And what I want it boots not to complain

LADY
Madam Ill sing

QUEEN
Tis well that thou hast cause
But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep

LADY
I could weep madam would it do you good

QUEEN
And I could sing would weeping do me good
And never borrow any tear of thee
But stay here come the gardeners
Lets step into the shadow of these trees
My wretchedness unto a row of pins
They will talk of state for every one doth so
Against a change woe is forerun with woe

QUEEN and Ladies retire

Enter a Gardener and two Servants

GARDENER
Go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks
Which like unruly children make their sire
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight
Give some supportance to the bending twigs
Go thou and like an executioner
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays
That look too lofty in our commonwealth
All must be even in our government
You thus employd I will go root away
The noisome weeds which without profit suck
The soils fertility from wholesome flowers

SERVANT
Why should we in the compass of a pale
Keep law and form and due proportion
Showing as in a model our firm estate
When our seawalled garden the whole land
Is full of weeds her fairest flowers chokd up
Her fruit trees all unprund her hedges ruind
Her knots disordered and her wholesome herbs
Swarming with caterpillars

GARDENER
Hold thy peace
He that hath sufferd this disorderd spring
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf
The weeds which his broadspreading leaves did shelter
That seemd in eating him to hold him up
Are pluckd up root and all by Bolingbroke
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire Bushy Green

SERVANT
What are they dead

GARDENER
They are and Bolingbroke
Hath seizd the wasteful King O what pity is it
That he had not so trimmd and dressd his land
As we this garden We at time of year
Do wound the bark the skin of our fruit trees
Lest being overproud in sap and blood
With too much riches it confound itself
Had he done so to great and growing men
They might have livd to bear and he to taste
Their fruits of duty superfluous branches
We lop away that bearing boughs may live
Had he done so himself had home the crown
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down

SERVANT
What think you the king shall be deposd

GARDENER
Depressd he is already and deposd
Tis doubt he will be letters came last night
To a dear friend of the good Duke of Yorks
That tell black tidings

QUEEN
O I am pressd to death through want of speaking

Coming forward

Thou old Adams likeness set to dress this garden
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
What Eve what serpent hath suggested thee
To make a second fall of cursed man
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposd
Darst thou thou little better thing than earth
Divine his downfall Say where when and how
Camst thou by this ill tidings Speak thou wretch

GARDENER
Pardon me madam little joy have I
To breathe this news yet what I say is true
King Richard he is in the mighty hold
Of Bolingbroke their fortunes both are weighd
In your lords scale is nothing but himself
And some few vanities that make him light
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke
Besides himself are all the English peers
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down
Post you to London and you will find it so
I speak no more than every one doth know

QUEEN
Nimble mischance that art so light of foot
Doth not thy embassage belong to me
And am I last that knows it O thou thinkest
To serve me last that I may longest keep
Thy sorrow in my breast Come ladies go
To meet at London Londons king in woe
What was I born to this that my sad look
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke
Gardener for telling me these news of woe
Pray God the plants thou graftst may never grow

Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies

GARDENER
Poor Queen so that thy state might be no worse
I would my skill were subject to thy curse
Here did she fall a tear here in this place
Ill set a bank of rue sour herb of grace
Rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen
In the remembrance of a weeping queen

Exeunt



ACT 4

SCENE I Westminster Hall

The Lords spiritual on the right side of the throne the Lords
temporal on the left the Commons below Enter BOLINGBROKE
AUMERLE SURREY NORTHUMBERLAND HENRY PERCY FITZWATER another
Lord the BISHOP OF CARLISLE the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER and
attendants OFFICERS behind with BAGOT

BOLINGBROKE
Call forth Bagot
Now Bagot freely speak thy mind
What thou dost know of noble Gloucesters death
Who wrought it with the King and who performd
The bloody office of his timeless end

BAGOT
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle

BOLINGBROKE
Cousin stand forth and look upon that man

BAGOT
My Lord Aumerle I know your daring tongue
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliverd
In that dead time when Gloucesters death was plotted
I heard you say Is not my arm of length
That reacheth from the restful English Court
As far as Calais to mine uncles head
Amongst much other talk that very time
I heard you say that you had rather refuse
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
Than Bolingbrokes return to England
Adding withal how blest this land would be
In this your cousins death

AUMERLE
Princes and noble lords
What answer shall I make to this base man
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars
On equal terms to give him chastisement
Either I must or have mine honour soild
With the attainder of his slanderous lips
There is my gage the manual seal of death
That marks thee out for hell I say thou liest
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
In thy heartblood through being all too base
To stain the temper of my knightly sword

BOLINGBROKE
Bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up

AUMERLE
Excepting one I would he were the best
In all this presence that hath movd me so

FITZWATER
If that thy valour stand on sympathies
There is my gage Aumerle in gage to thine
By that fair sun which shows me where thou standst
I heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakst it
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucesters death
If thou denyst it twenty times thou liest
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart
Where it was forged with my rapiers point

AUMERLE
Thou darest not coward live to see that day

FITZWATER
Now by my soul I would it were this hour

AUMERLE
Fitzwater thou art damnd to hell for this

HENRY PERCY
Aumerle thou liest his honour is as true
In this appeal as thou art an unjust
And that thou art so there I throw my gage
To prove it on thee to the extremest point
Of mortal breathing seize it if thou darst

AUMERLE
And if I do not may my hands rot off
And never brandish more revengeful steel
Over the glittering helmet of my foe

ANOTHER LORD
I task the earth to the like forsworn Aumerle
And spur thee on with full as many lies
As may be halload in thy treacherous ear
From sun to sun there is my honours pawn
Engage it to the trial if thou darst

AUMERLE
Who sets me else By heaven Ill throw at all
I have a thousand spirits in one breast
To answer twenty thousand such as you

SURREY
My Lord Fitzwater I do remember well
The very time Aumerle and you did talk

FITZWATER
Tis very true you were in presence then
And you can witness with me this is true

SURREY
As false by heaven as heaven itself is true

FITZWATER
Surrey thou liest

SURREY
Dishonourable boy
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword
That it shall render vengeance and revenge
Till thou the liegiver and that lie do lie
In earth as quiet as thy fathers skull
In proof whereof there is my honours pawn
Engage it to the trial if thou darst

FITZWATER
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse
If I dare eat or drink or breathe or live
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness
And spit upon him whilst I say he lies
And lies and lies there is my bond of faith
To tie thee to my strong correction
As I intend to thrive in this new world
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal
Besides I heard the banishd Norfolk say
That thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men
To execute the noble duke at Calais

AUMERLE
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
That Norfolk lies here do I throw down this
If he may be repeald to try his honour

BOLINGBROKE
These differences shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeald repeald he shall be
And though mine enemy restord again
To all his lands and signories when he is returnd
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial

CARLISLE
That honourable day shall neer be seen
Many a time hath banishd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans Turks and Saracens
And toild with works of war retird himself
To Italy and there at Venice gave
His body to that pleasant countrys earth
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ
Under whose colours he had fought so long

BOLINGBROKE
Why Bishop is Norfolk dead

CARLISLE
As surely as I live my lord

BOLINGBROKE
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
Of good old Abraham Lords appellants
Your differences shall all rest under gage
Till we assign you to your days of trial

Enter YORK attended

YORK
Great Duke of Lancaster I come to the
From plumepluckd Richard who with willing soul
Adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields
To the possession of thy royal hand
Ascend his throne descending now from him
And long live Henry of that name the fourth

BOLINGBROKE
In Gods name Ill ascend the regal throne

CARLISLE
Marry God forbid
Worst in this royal presence may I speak
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth
Would God that any in this noble presence
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble Richard Then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong
What subject can give sentence on his king
And who sits here that is not Richards subject
Thieves are not judgd but they are by to hear
Although apparent guilt be seen in them
And shall the figure of Gods majesty
His captain steward deputy elect
Anointed crowned planted many years
Be judgd by subject and inferior breath
And he himself not present O forfend it God
That in a Christian climate souls refind
Should show so heinous black obscene a deed
I speak to subjects and a subject speaks
Stirrd up by God thus boldly for his king
My Lord of Hereford here whom you call king
Is a foul traitor to proud Herefords king
And if you crown him let me prophesy
The blood of English shall manure the ground
And future ages groan for this foul act
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound
Disorder horror fear and mutiny
Shall here inhabit and this land be calld
The field of Golgotha and dead mens skulls
O if you raise this house against this house
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth
Prevent it resist it let it not be so
Lest child childs children cry against you woe

NORTHUMBERLAND
Well have you argued sir and for your pains
Of capital treason we arrest you here
My Lord of Westminster be it your charge
To keep him safely till his day of trial
May it please you lords to grant the commons suit

BOLINGBROKE
Fetch hither Richard that in common view
He may surrender so we shall proceed
Without suspicion

YORK
I will be his conduct

Exit

BOLINGBROKE
Lords you that here are under our arrest
Procure your sureties for your days of answer
Little are we beholding to your love
And little lookd for at your helping hands

Reenter YORK with KING RICHARD and OFFICERS
bearing the Crown c

KING RICHARD
Alack why am I sent for to a king
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
Wherewith I reignd I hardly yet have learnd
To insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission Yet I well remember
The favours of these men were they not mine
Did they not sometime cry All hail to me
So Judas did to Christ but he in twelve
Found truth in all but one I in twelve thousand none
God save the King Will no man say amen
Am I both priest and clerk Well then amen
God save the King although I be not he
And yet amen if heaven do think him me
To do what service am I sent for hither

YORK
To do that office of thine own good will
Which tired majesty did make thee offer
The resignation of thy state and crown
To Henry Bolingbroke

KING RICHARD
Give me the crown Here cousin seize the crown
Here cousin
On this side my hand and on that side thine
Now is this golden crown like a deep well
That owes two buckets filling one another
The emptier ever dancing in the air
The other down unseen and full of water
That bucket down and full of tears am I
Drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high

BOLINGBROKE
I thought you had been willing to resign

KING RICHARD
My crown I am but still my griefs are mine
You may my glories and my state depose
But not my griefs still am I king of those

BOLINGBROKE
Part of your cares you give me with your crown

KING RICHARD
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down
My care is loss of care by old care done
Your care is gain of care by new care won
The cares I give I have though given away
They tend the crown yet still with me they stay

BOLINGBROKE
Are you contented to resign the crown

KING RICHARD
Ay no no ay for I must nothing be
Therefore no no for I resign to thee
Now mark me how I will undo myself
I give this heavy weight from off my head
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart
With mine own tears I wash away my balm
With mine own hands I give away my crown
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state
With mine own breath release all duteous rites
All pomp and majesty I do forswear
My manors rents revenues I forgo
My acts decrees and statutes I deny
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me
God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee
Make me that nothing have with nothing grievd
And thou with all pleasd that hast an achievd
Long mayst thou live in Richards seat to sit
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit
God save King Henry unkingd Richard says
And send him many years of sunshine days
What more remains

NORTHUMBERLAND
Offering a paper No more but that you read
These accusations and these grievous crimes
Committed by your person and your followers
Against the state and profit of this land
That by confessing them the souls of men
May deem that you are worthily deposd

KING RICHARD
Must I do so And must I ravel out
My weavdup follies Gentle Northumberland
If thy offences were upon record
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them If thou wouldst
There shouldst thou find one heinous article
Containing the deposing of a king
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath
Markd with a blot damnd in the book of heaven
Nay all of you that stand and look upon me
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
Showing an outward pity yet you Pilates
Have here deliverd me to my sour cross
And water cannot wash away your sin

NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord dispatch read oer these articles

KING RICHARD
Mine eyes are full of tears I cannot see
And yet salt water blinds them not so much
But they can see a sort of traitors here
Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself
I find myself a traitor with the rest
For I have given here my souls consent
Tundeck the pompous body of a king
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave
Proud majesty a subject state a peasant

NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord

KING RICHARD
No lord of thine thou haught insulting man
Nor no mans lord I have no name no title
No not that name was given me at the font
But tis usurpd alack the heavy day
That I have worn so many winters out
And know not now what name to call myself
O that I were a mockery king of snow
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke
To melt myself away in waterdrops
Good king great kingand yet not greatly good
An if my word be sterling yet in England
Let it command a mirror hither straight
That it may show me what a face I have
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty

BOLINGBROKE
Go some of you and fetch a lookingglass

Exit an Attendant

NORTHUMBERLAND
Read oer this paper while the glass doth come

KING RICHARD
Fiend thou torments me ere I come to hell

BOLINGBROKE
Urge it no more my Lord Northumberland

NORTHUMBERLAND
The Commons will not then be satisfied

KING RICHARD
They shall be satisfied Ill read enough
When I do see the very book indeed
Where all my sins are writ and thats myself

Reenter Attendant with glass

Give me that glass and therein will I read
No deeper wrinkles yet Hath sorrow struck
So many blows upon this face of mine
And made no deeper wounds O flattring glass
Like to my followers in prosperity
Thou dost beguile me Was this face the face
That every day under his household roof
Did keep ten thousand men Was this the face
That like the sun did make beholders wink
Is this the face which facd so many follies
That was at last outfacd by Bolingbroke
A brittle glory shineth in this face
As brittle as the glory is the face

Dashes the glass against the ground

For there it is crackd in a hundred shivers
Mark silent king the moral of this sport
How soon my sorrow hath destroyd my face

BOLINGBROKE
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyd
The shadow of your face

KING RICHARD
Say that again
The shadow of my sorrow Ha lets see
Tis very true my grief lies all within
And these external manner of laments
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
That swells with silence in the torturd soul
There lies the substance and I thank thee king
For thy great bounty that not only givest
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
How to lament the cause Ill beg one boon
And then be gone and trouble you no more
Shall I obtain it

BOLINGBROKE
Name it fair cousin

KING RICHARD
Fair cousin I am greater than a king
For when I was a king my flatterers
Were then but subjects being now a subject
I have a king here to my flatterer
Being so great I have no need to beg

BOLINGBROKE
Yet ask

KING RICHARD
And shall I have

BOLINGBROKE
You shall

KING RICHARD
Then give me leave to go

BOLINGBROKE
Whither

KING RICHARD
Whither you will so I were from your sights

BOLINGBROKE
Go some of you convey him to the Tower

KING RICHARD
O good convey conveyers are you all
That rise thus nimbly by a true kings fall

Exeunt KING RICHARD and Guard

BOLINGBROKE
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation lords prepare yourselves

Exeunt all but the BISHOP OF CARLISLE the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER
and AUMERLE

ABBOT
A woeful pageant have we here beheld

CARLISLE
The woes to come the children yet unborn
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn

AUMERLE
You holy clergymen is there no plot
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot

ABBOT
My lord
Before I freely speak my mind herein
You shall not only take the sacrament
To bury mine intents but also to effect
Whatever I shall happen to devise
I see your brows are full of discontent
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears
Come home with me to supper I will lay
A plot shall show us all a merry day

Exeunt



ACT 5

SCENE I London A street leading to the Tower

Enter the QUEEN and ladies

QUEEN
This way the King will come this is the way
To Julius Caesars illerected tower
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
Is doomd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke
Here let us rest if this rebellious earth
Have any resting for her true Kings queen

Enter KING RICHARD and Guard

But soft but see or rather do not see
My fair rose wither yet look up behold
That you in pity may dissolve to dew
And wash him fresh again with truelove tears
Ah thou the model where old Troy did stand
Thou map of honour thou King Richards tomb
And not King Richard thou most beauteous inn
Why should hardfavourd grief be lodgd in thee
When triumph is become an alehouse guest

KING RICHARD
Join not with grief fair woman do not so
To make my end too sudden learn good soul
To think our former state a happy dream
From which awakd the truth of what we are
Shows us but this I am sworn brother sweet
To grim Necessity and he and
Will keep a league till death Hie thee to France
And cloister thee in some religious house
Our holy lives must win a new worlds crown
Which our profane hours here have thrown down

QUEEN
What is my Richard both in shape and mind
Transformd and weakend Hath Bolingbroke deposd
Thine intellect Hath he been in thy heart
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
To be oerpowerd and wilt thou pupillike
Take the correction mildly kiss the rod
And fawn on rage with base humility
Which art a lion and the king of beasts

KING RICHARD
A king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts
I had been still a happy king of men
Good sometimes queen prepare thee hence for France
Think I am dead and that even here thou takst
As from my deathbed thy last living leave
In winters tedious nights sit by the fire
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid
And ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
And send the hearers weeping to their beds
For why the senseless brands will sympathize
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
And in compassion weep the fire out
And some will mourn in ashes some coalblack
For the deposing of a rightful king

Enter NORTHUMBERLAND attended

NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord the mind of Bolingbroke is changd
You must to Pomfret not unto the Tower
And madam there is order taen for you
With all swift speed you must away to France

KING RICHARD
Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne
The time shall not be many hours of age
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
Shall break into corruption Thou shalt think
Though he divide the realm and give thee half
It is too little helping him to all
And he shall think that thou which knowst the way
To plant unrightful kings wilt know again
Being neer so little urgd another way
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
The love of wicked men converts to fear
That fear to hate and hate turns one or both
To worthy danger and deserved death

NORTHUMBERLAND
My guilt be on my head and there an end
Take leave and part for you must part forthwith

KING RICHARD
Doubly divorcd Bad men ye violate
A twofold marriage twixt my crown and me
And then betwixt me and my married wife
Let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me
And yet not so for with a kiss twas made
Part us Northumberland I towards the north
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime
My wife to France from whence set forth in pomp
She came adorned hither like sweet May
Sent back like Hallowmas or shortst of day

QUEEN
And must we be divided Must we part

KING RICHARD
Ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart

QUEEN
Banish us both and send the king with me

NORTHUMBERLAND
That were some love but little policy

QUEEN
Then whither he goes thither let me go

KING RICHARD
So two together weeping make one woe
Weep thou for me in France I for thee here
Better far off than near be neer the near
Go count thy way with sighs I mine with groans

QUEEN
So longest way shall have the longest moans

KING RICHARD
Twice for one step Ill groan the way being short
And piece the way out with a heavy heart
Come come in wooing sorrow lets be brief
Since wedding it there is such length in grief
One kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part
Thus give I mine and thus take I thy heart

They kiss

QUEEN
Give me mine own again twere no good part
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart

They kiss again

So now I have mine own again be gone
That I may strive to kill it with a groan

KING RICHARD
We make woe wanton with this fond delay
Once more adieu the rest let sorrow say

Exeunt



SCENE II The same A roomin the DUKE OF YORKs palace

Enter YORK and his DUCHESS

DUCHESS
My Lord you told me you would tell the rest
When weeping made you break the story off
Of our two cousins coming into London

YORK
Where did I leave

DUCHESS
At that sad stop my lord
Where rude misgoverned hands from windows tops
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richards head

YORK
Then as I said the Duke great Bolingbroke
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
Which his aspiring rider seemd to know
With slow but stately pace kept on his course
Whilst all tongues cried God save thee Bolingbroke
You would have thought the very windows spake
So many greedy looks of young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon his visage and that all the walls
With painted imagery had said at once
Jesu preserve thee Welcome Bolingbroke
Whilst he from the one side to the other turning
Bareheaded lower than his proud steeds neck
Bespake them thus I thank you countrymen
And thus still doing thus he passd along

DUCHESS
Alack poor Richard where rode he the whilst

YORK
As in a theatre the eyes of men
After a wellgracd actor leaves the stage
Are idly bent on him that enters next
Thinking his prattle to be tedious
Even so or with much more contempt mens eyes
Did scowl on Richard no man cried God save him
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
His face still combating with tears and smiles
The badges of his grief and patience
That had not God for some strong purpose steeld
The hearts of men they must perforce have melted
And barbarism itself have pitied him
But heaven hath a hand in these events
To whose high will we bound our calm contents
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
Whose state and honour I for aye allow

DUCHESS
Here comes my son Aumerle

YORK
Aumerle that was
But that is lost for being Richards friend
And madam you must call him Rutland now
I am in Parliament pledge for his truth
And lasting fealty to the newmade king

Enter AUMERLE

DUCHESS
Welcome my son who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of the new come spring

AUMERLE
Madam I know not nor I greatly care not
God knows I had as lief be none as one

YORK
Well bear you well in this new spring of time
Lest you be croppd before you come to prime
What news from Oxford hold those justs and triumphs

AUMERLE
For aught I know my lord they do

YORK
You will be there I know

AUMERLE
If God prevent not I purpose so

YORK
What seal is that that without thy bosom
Yea lookst thou pale Let me see the writing

AUMERLE
My lord tis nothing

YORK
No matter then who see it
I will be satisfied let me see the writing

AUMERLE
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me
It is a matter of small consequence
Which for some reasons I would not have seen

YORK
Which for some reasons sir I mean to see
I fear I fear

DUCHESS
What should you fear
Tis nothing but some bond that he is entred into
For gay apparel gainst the triumph day

YORK
Bound to himself What doth he with a bond
That he is bound to Wife thou art a fool
Boy let me see the writing

AUMERLE
I do beseech you pardon me I may not show it

YORK
I will be satisfied let me see it I say

Snatches it and reads

Treason foul treason Villain traitor slave

DUCHESS
What is the matter my lord

YORK
Ho who is within there

Enter a Servant

Saddle my horse
God for his mercy what treachery is here

DUCHESS
Why what is it my lord

YORK
Give me my boots I say saddle my horse
Now by mine honour by my life my troth
I will appeach the villain

Exit Servant

DUCHESS
What is the matter

YORK
Peace foolish woman

DUCHESS
I will not peace What is the matter Aumerle

AUMERLE
Good mother be content it is no more
Than my poor life must answer

DUCHESS
Thy life answer

YORK
Bring me my boots I will unto the King

Reenter Servant with boots

DUCHESS
Strike him Aumerle Poor boy thou art amazd
To Servant
Hence villain never more come in my sight

Exit Servant

YORK
Give me my boots I say

DUCHESS
Why York what wilt thou do
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own
Have we more sons or are we like to have
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
And rob me of a happy mothers name
Is he not like thee Is he not thine own

YORK
Thou fond mad woman
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy
A dozen of them here have taen the sacrament
And interchangeably set down their hands
To kill the King at Oxford

DUCHESS
He shall be none
Well keep him here then what is that to him

YORK
Away fond woman were he twenty times my son
I would appeach him

DUCHESS
Hadst thou groand for him
As I have done thoudst be more pitiful
But now I know thy mind thou dost suspect
That I have been disloyal to thy bed
And that he is a bastard not thy son
Sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind
He is as like thee as a man may be
Not like to me or any of my kin
And yet I love him

YORK
Make way unruly woman

Exit

DUCHESS
After Aumerle Mount thee upon his horse
Spur post and get before him to the king
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
Ill not be long behind though I be old
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York
And never will I rise up from the ground
Till Bolingbroke have pardond thee Away be gone

Exeunt



SCENE III Windsor A room in the Castle

Enter BOLINGBROKE as King HENRY PERCY and other LORDS

BOLINGBROKE
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son
Tis full three months since I did see him last
If any plague hang over us tis he
I would to God my lords he might be found
Inquire at London mongst the taverns there
For there they say he daily doth frequent
With unrestrained loose companions
Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes
And beat our watch and rob our passengers
Which he young wanton and effeminate boy
Takes on the point of honour to support
So dissolute a crew

PERCY
My lord some two days since I saw the prince
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford

BOLINGBROKE
And what said the gallant

PERCY
His answer was he would unto the stews
And from the commonst creature pluck a glove
And wear it as a favour and with that
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger

BOLINGBROKE
As dissolute as desperate yet through both
I see some sparks of better hope which elder years
May happily bring forth But who comes here

Enter AUMERLE

AUMERLE
Where is the King

BOLINGBROKE
What means our cousin that he stares and looks
So wildly

AUMERLE
God save your Grace I do beseech your majesty
To have some conference with your Grace alone

BOLINGBROKE
Withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone

Exeunt HENRY PERCY and LORDS

What is the matter with our cousin now

AUMERLE
Kneels For ever may my knees grow to the earth
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak

BOLINGBROKE
Intended or committed was this fault
If on the first how heinous eer it be
To win thy afterlove I pardon thee

AUMERLE
Then give me leave that I may turn the key
That no man enter till my tale be done

BOLINGBROKE
Have thy desire

AUMERLE locks the door

YORK
Within My liege beware look to thyself
Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there

BOLINGBROKE
Drawing Villain Ill make thee safe

AUMERLE
Stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear

YORK
Within Open the door secure foolhardy king
Shall I for love speak treason to thy face
Open the door or I will break it open

BOLINGBROKE unlocks the door and afterwards relocks it

Enter YORK

BOLINGBROKE
What is the matter uncle speak
Recover breath tell us how near is danger
That we may arm us to encounter it

YORK
Peruse this writing here and thou shalt know
The treason that my haste forbids me show

AUMERLE
Remember as thou readst thy promise passd
I do repent me read not my name there
My heart is not confederate with my hand

YORK
It was villain ere thy hand did set it down
I tore it from the traitors bosom king
Fear and not love begets his penitence
Forget to pity him lest thy pity prove
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart

BOLINGBROKE
O heinous strong and bold conspiracy
O loyal father of a treacherous son
Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain
From whence this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defild himself
Thy overflow of good converts to bad
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
This deadly blot in thy digressing son

YORK
So shall my virtue be his vices bawd
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies
Or my shamd life in his dishonour lies
Thou killst me in his life giving him breath
The traitor lives the true mans put to death

DUCHESS
Within What ho my liege for Gods sake let me in

BOLINGBROKE
What shrillvoicd suppliant makes this eager cry

DUCHESS
Within A woman and thine aunt great king tis I
Speak with me pity me open the door
A beggar begs that never beggd before

BOLINGBROKE
Our scene is alterd from a serious thing
And now changd to The Beggar and the King
My dangerous cousin let your mother in
I know shes come to pray for your foul sin

YORK
If thou do pardon whosoever pray
More sins for this forgiveness prosper may
This festerd joint cut off the rest rest sound
This let alone will all the rest confound

Enter DUCHESS

DUCHESS
O King believe not this hardhearted man
Love loving not itself none other can

YORK
Thou frantic woman what dost thou make here
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear

DUCHESS
Sweet York be patient Kneels Hear me gentle liege

BOLINGBROKE
Rise up good aunt

DUCHESS
Not yet I thee beseech
For ever will I walk upon my knees
And never see day that the happy sees
Till thou give joy until thou bid me joy
By pardoning Rutland my transgressing boy

AUMERLE
Unto my mothers prayers I bend my knee

Kneels

YORK
Against them both my true joints bended be

Kneels

Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace

DUCHESS
Pleads he in earnest Look upon his face
His eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest
His words come from his mouth ours from our breast
He prays but faintly and would be denied
We pray with heart and soul and all beside
His weary joints would gladly rise I know
Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity
Our prayers do outpray his then let them have
That mercy which true prayer ought to have

BOLINGBROKE
Good aunt stand up

DUCHESS
Nay do not say stand up
Say pardon first and afterwards stand up
An if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach
Pardon should be the first word of thy speech
I never longd to hear a word till now
Say pardon king let pity teach thee how
The word is short but not so short as sweet
No word like pardon for kings mouths so meet

YORK
Speak it in French King say pardonne moy

DUCHESS
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy
Ah my sour husband my hardhearted lord
That settst the word itself against the word
Speak pardon as tis current in our land
The chopping French we do not understand
Thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce
Pity may move thee pardon to rehearse

BOLINGBROKE
Good aunt stand up

DUCHESS
I do not sue to stand
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand

BOLINGBROKE
I pardon him as God shall pardon me

DUCHESS
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee
Yet am I sick for fear speak it again
Twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain

But makes one pardon strong

BOLINGBROKE
With all my heart
I pardon him

DUCHESS
A god on earth thou art

BOLINGBROKE
But for our trusty brotherinlaw and the abbot
With all the rest of that consorted crew
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels
Good uncle help to order several powers
To Oxford or whereer these traitors are
They shall not live within this world I swear
But I will have them if I once know where
Uncle farewell and cousin adieu
Your mother well hath prayd and prove you true

DUCHESS
Come my old son I pray God make thee new

Exeunt



SCENE IV Another room in the Castle

Enter EXTON and a Servant

EXTON
Didst thou not mark the king what words he spake
Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear
Was it not so

SERVANT
These were his very words

EXTON
Have I no friend quoth he he spake it twice
And urgd it twice together did he not

SERVANT
He did

EXTON
And speaking it he wistly looked on me
As who should say I would thou wert the man
That would divorce this terror from my heart
Meaning the king at Pomfret Come lets go
I am the kings friend and will rid his foe

Exeunt



SCENE V Pomfret The dungeon of the Castle

Enter KING RICHARD

KING RICHARD
I have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world
And for because the world is populous
And here is not a creature but myself
I cannot do it yet Ill hammer it out
My brain Ill prove the female to my soul
My soul the father and these two beget
A generation of stillbreeding thoughts
And these same thoughts people this little world
In humours like the people of this world
For no thought is contented The better sort
As thoughts of things divine are intermixd
With scruples and do set the word itself
Against the word
As thus Come little ones and then again
It is as hard to come as for a camel
To thread the postern of a needles eye
Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world my ragged prison walls
And for they cannot die in their own pride
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
That they are not the first of fortunes slaves
Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
That many have and others must sit there
And in this thought they find a kind of ease
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
Of such as have before endurd the like
Thus play I in one person many people
And none contented sometimes am I king
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar
And so I am then crushing penury
Persuades me I was better when a king
Then am I kingd again and by and by
Think that I am unkingd by Bolingbroke
And straight am nothing but whateer I be
Nor I nor any man that but man is
With nothing shall be pleasd till he be easd
With being nothing
Music do I hear Music
Ha ha keep time How sour sweet music is
When time is broke and no proportion kept
So is it in the music of mens lives
And here have I the daintiness of ear
To check time broke in a disorderd string
But for the concord of my state and time
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke
I wasted time and now doth time waste me
For now hath time made me his numbering clock
My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
Whereto my finger like a dials point
Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears
Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart
Which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans
Show minutes times and hours but my time
Runs posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joy
While I stand fooling here his Jack o the clock
This music mads me let it sound no more
For though it have holp madmen to their wits
In me it seems it will make wise men mad
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me
For tis a sign of love and love to Richard
Is a strange brooch in this allhating world

Enter a Groom of the stable

GROOM
Hail royal Prince

KING RICHARD
Thanks noble peer
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
What art thou and how comest thou hither man
Where no man never comes but that sad dog
That brings me food to make misfortune live

GROOM
I was a poor groom of thy stable king
When thou wert king who travelling towards York
With much ado at length have gotten leave
To look upon my sometimes royal masters face
O how it yearnd my heart when I beheld
In London streets that coronation day
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid
That horse that I so carefully have dressd

KING RICHARD
Rode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend
How went he under him

GROOM
So proudly as if he disdaind the ground

KING RICHARD
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him
Would he not stumble would he not fall down
Since pride must have a falland break the neck
Of that proud man that did usurp his back
Forgiveness horse Why do I rail on thee
Since thou created to be awd by man
Wast born to bear I was not made a horse
And yet I bear a burden like an ass
Spurgalld and tird by jauncing Bolingbroke

Enter Keeper with a dish

KEEPER To the Groom
Fellow give place here is no longer stay

KING RICHARD
If thou love me tis time thou wert away

GROOM
My tongue dares not that my heart shall say

Exit

KEEPER
My lord willt please you to fall to

KING RICHARD
Taste of it first as thou art wont to do

KEEPER
My lord I dare not Sir Pierce of Exton
Who lately came from the king commands the contrary

KING RICHARD
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee
Patience is stale and I am weary of it

Strikes the Keeper

KEEPER
Help help help

Enter EXTON and Servants armed

KING RICHARD
How now What means death in this rude assault
Villain thy own hand yields thy deaths instrument

Snatching a weapon and killing one

Go thou and fill another room in hell

He kills another then EXTON strikes him down

That hand shall burn in neverquenching fire
That staggers thus my person Exton thy fierce hand
Hath with the kings blood staind the kings own land
Mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die

Dies

EXTON
As full of valour as of royal blood
Both have I spilt O would the deed were good
For now the devil that told me I did well
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell
This dead king to the living king Ill bear
Take hence the rest and give them burial here

Exeunt



SCENE VI Windsor An Apartment in the Castle

Flourish Enter BOLINGBROKE and YORK with Lords
and Attendants

BOLINGBROKE
Kind uncle York the latest news we hear
Is that the rebels have consumd with fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire
But whether they be taen or slain we hear not

Enter NORTHUMBERLAND

Welcome my lord What is the news

NORTHUMBERLAND
First to thy sacred state wish I all happiness
The next news is I have to London sent
The heads of Salisbury Spencer Blunt and Kent
The manner of their taking may appear
At large discoursed in this paper here

BOLINGBROKE
We thank thee gentle Percy for thy pains
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains

Enter FITZWATER

FITZWATER
My lord I have from Oxford sent to London
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow

BOLINGBROKE
Thy pains Fitzwater shall not be forgot
Right noble is thy merit well I wot

Enter HENRY PERCY With the BISHOP OF CARLISLE

PERCY
The grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
Hath yielded up his body to the grave
But here is Carlisle living to abide
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride

BOLINGBROKE
Carlisle this is your doom
Choose out some secret place some reverend room
More than thou hast and with it joy thy life
So as thou livest in peace die free from strife
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen

Enter EXTON with attendants hearing a coffin

EXTON
Great king within this coffin I present
Thy buried fear herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies
Richard of Bordeaux by me hither brought

BOLINGBROKE
Exton I thank thee not for thou hast wrought
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my head and all this famous land

EXTON
From your own mouth my lord did I this deed

BOLINGBROKE
They love not poison that do poison need
Nor do I thee though I did wish him dead
I hate the murderer love him murdered
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour
But neither my good word nor princely favour
With Cain go wander thorough shade of night
And never show thy head by day nor light
Lords I protest my soul is full of woe
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow
Come mourn with me for what I do lament
And put on sullen black incontinent
Ill make a voyage to the Holy Land
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand
March sadly after grace my mournings here
In weeping after this untimely bier

Exeunt
