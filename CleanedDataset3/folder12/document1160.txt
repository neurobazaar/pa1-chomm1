THE GAME


CHAPTER I


Many patterns of carpet lay rolled out before them on the floortwo of
Brussels showed the beginning of their quest and its ending in that
direction while a score of ingrains lured their eyes and prolonged the
debate between desire pocketbook The head of the department did them
the honor of waiting upon them himselfor did Joe the honor as she well
knew for she had noted the openmouthed awe of the elevator boy who
brought them up Nor had she been blind to the marked respect shown Joe
by the urchins and groups of young fellows on corners when she walked
with him in their own neighborhood down at the west end of the town

But the head of the department was called away to the telephone and in
her mind the splendid promise of the carpets and the irk of the pocket
book were thrust aside by a greater doubt and anxiety

But I dont see what you find to like in it Joe she said softly the
note of insistence in her words betraying recent and unsatisfactory
discussion

For a fleeting moment a shadow darkened his boyish face to be replaced
by the glow of tenderness He was only a boy as she was only a girltwo
young things on the threshold of life houserenting and buying carpets
together

Whats the good of worrying he questioned Its the last go the
very last

He smiled at her but she saw on his lips the unconscious and all but
breathed sigh of renunciation and with the instinctive monopoly of woman
for her mate she feared this thing she did not understand and which
gripped his life so strongly

You know the go with ONeil cleared the last payment on mothers house
he went on And thats off my mind Now this last with Ponta will give
me a hundred dollars in bankan even hundred thats the pursefor you
and me to start on a nestegg

She disregarded the money appeal But you like it thisthis game
you call it Why

He lacked speechexpression He expressed himself with his hands at his
work and with his body and the play of his muscles in the squared ring
but to tell with his own lips the charm of the squared ring was beyond
him Yet he essayed and haltingly at first to express what he felt and
analyzed when playing the Game at the supreme summit of existence

All I know Genevieve is that you feel good in the ring when youve got
the man where you want him when hes had a punch up both sleeves waiting
for you and youve never given him an opening to land em when youve
landed your own little punch an hes goin groggy an holdin on an
the referees dragging him off sos you can go in an finish m an all
the house is shouting an tearin itself loose an you know youre the
best man an that you played m fair an won out because youre the best
man I tell you

He ceased brokenly alarmed by his own volubility and by Genevieves look
of alarm As he talked she had watched his face while fear dawned in her
own As he described the moment of moments to her on his inward vision
were lined the tottering man the lights the shouting house and he
swept out and away from her on this tide of life that was beyond her
comprehension menacing irresistible making her love pitiful and weak
The Joe she knew receded faded became lost The fresh boyish face was
gone the tenderness of the eyes the sweetness of the mouth with its
curves and pictured corners It was a mans face she saw a face of
steel tense and immobile a mouth of steel the lips like the jaws of a
trap eyes of steel dilated intent and the light in them and the
glitter were the light and glitter of steel The face of a man and she
had known only his boy face This face she did not know at all

And yet while it frightened her she was vaguely stirred with pride in
him His masculinity the masculinity of the fighting male made its
inevitable appeal to her a female moulded by all her heredity to seek
out the strong man for mate and to lean against the wall of his
strength She did not understand this force of his being that rose
mightier than her love and laid its compulsion upon him and yet in her
womans heart she was aware of the sweet pang which told her that for her
sake for Loves own sake he had surrendered to her abandoned all that
portion of his life and with this one last fight would never fight
again

Mrs Silverstein doesnt like prizefighting she said Shes down on
it and she knows something too

He smiled indulgently concealing a hurt not altogether new at her
persistent inappreciation of this side of his nature and life in which he
took the greatest pride It was to him power and achievement earned by
his own effort and hard work and in the moment when he had offered
himself and all that he was to Genevieve it was this and this alone
that he was proudly conscious of laying at her feet It was the merit of
work performed a guerdon of manhood finer and greater than any other man
could offer and it had been to him his justification and right to
possess her And she had not understood it then as she did not
understand it now and he might well have wondered what else she found in
him to make him worthy

Mrs Silverstein is a dub and a softy and a knocker he said good
humoredly Whats she know about such things anyway I tell you it
_is_ good and healthy toothis last as an afterthought Look at
me I tell you I have to live clean to be in condition like this I
live cleaner than she does or her old man or anybody you knowbaths
rubdowns exercise regular hours good food and no makin a pig of
myself no drinking no smoking nothing thatll hurt me Why I live
cleaner than you Genevieve

Honest I do he hastened to add at sight of her shocked face I
dont mean water an soap but look there His hand closed reverently
but firmly on her arm Soft youre all soft all over Not like mine
Here feel this

He pressed the ends of her fingers into his hard armmuscles until she
winced from the hurt

Hard all over just like that he went on Now thats what I call
clean Every bit of flesh an blood an muscle is clean right down to
the bonesand theyre clean too No soap and water only on the skin
but clean all the way in I tell you it feels clean It knows its
clean itself When I wake up in the morning an go to work every drop
of blood and bit of meat is shouting right out that it is clean Oh I
tell you

He paused with swift awkwardness again confounded by his unwonted flow
of speech Never in his life had he been stirred to such utterance and
never in his life had there been cause to be so stirred For it was the
Game that had been questioned its verity and worth the Game itself the
biggest thing in the worldor what had been the biggest thing in the
world until that chance afternoon and that chance purchase in
Silversteins candy store when Genevieve loomed suddenly colossal in his
life overshadowing all other things He was beginning to see though
vaguely the sharp conflict between woman and career between a mans
work in the world and womans need of the man But he was not capable of
generalization He saw only the antagonism between the concrete flesh
andblood Genevieve and the great abstract living Game Each resented
the other each claimed him he was torn with the strife and yet drifted
helpless on the currents of their contention

His words had drawn Genevieves gaze to his face and she had pleasured
in the clear skin the clear eyes the cheek soft and smooth as a girls
She saw the force of his argument and disliked it accordingly She
revolted instinctively against this Game which drew him away from her
robbed her of part of him It was a rival she did not understand Nor
could she understand its seductions Had it been a woman rival another
girl knowledge and light and sight would have been hers As it was she
grappled in the dark with an intangible adversary about which she knew
nothing What truth she felt in his speech made the Game but the more
formidable

A sudden conception of her weakness came to her She felt pity for
herself and sorrow She wanted him all of him her womans need would
not be satisfied with less and he eluded her slipped away here and
there from the embrace with which she tried to clasp him Tears swam
into her eyes and her lips trembled turning defeat into victory
routing the allpotent Game with the strength of her weakness

Dont Genevieve dont the boy pleaded all contrition though he was
confused and dazed To his masculine mind there was nothing relevant
about her breakdown yet all else was forgotten at sight of her tears

She smiled forgiveness through her wet eyes and though he knew of
nothing for which to be forgiven he melted utterly His hand went out
impulsively to hers but she avoided the clasp by a sort of bodily
stiffening and chill the while the eyes smiled still more gloriously

Here comes Mr Clausen she said at the same time by some
transforming alchemy of woman presenting to the newcomer eyes that
showed no hint of moistness

Think I was never coming back Joe queried the head of the department
a pinkandwhitefaced man whose austere sidewhiskers were belied by
genial little eyes

Now let me seehum yes we was discussing ingrains he continued
briskly That tasty little pattern there catches your eye dont it
now eh Yes yes I know all about it I set up housekeeping when I
was getting fourteen a week But nothings too good for the little nest
eh Of course I know and its only seven cents more and the dearest is
the cheapest I say Tell you what Ill do Joethis with a burst of
philanthropic impulsiveness and a confidential lowering of
voiceseeins its you and I wouldnt do it for anybody else Ill
reduce it to five cents Onlyhere his voice became impressively
solemnonly you mustnt ever tell how much you really did pay

Sewed lined and laidof course thats included he said after Joe
and Genevieve had conferred together and announced their decision

And the little nest eh he queried When do you spread your wings
and fly away Tomorrow So soon Beautiful Beautiful

He rolled his eyes ecstatically for a moment then beamed upon them with
a fatherly air

Joe had replied sturdily enough and Genevieve had blushed prettily but
both felt that it was not exactly proper Not alone because of the
privacy and holiness of the subject but because of what might have been
prudery in the middle class but which in them was the modesty and
reticence found in individuals of the working class when they strive
after clean living and morality

Mr Clausen accompanied them to the elevator all smiles patronage and
beneficence while the clerks turned their heads to follow Joes
retreating figure

And tonight Joe Mr Clausen asked anxiously as they waited at the
shaft How do you feel Think youll do him

Sure Joe answered Never felt better in my life

You feel all right eh Good Good You see I was just
awonderinyou know ha hagoin to get married and the restthought
you might be unstrung eh a triflenerves just a bit off you know
Know how gettin married is myself But youre all right eh Of course
you are No use asking _you_ that Ha ha Well good luck my boy I
know youll win Never had the least doubt of course of course

And goodby Miss Pritchard he said to Genevieve gallantly handing
her into the elevator Hope you call often Will be charmedcharmedI
assure you

Everybody calls you Joe she said reproachfully as the car dropped
downward Why dont they call you Mr Fleming Thats no more than
proper

But he was staring moodily at the elevator boy and did not seem to hear

Whats the matter Joe she asked with a tenderness the power of which
to thrill him she knew full well

Oh nothing he said I was only thinkingand wishing

Wishingwhat Her voice was seduction itself and her eyes would
have melted stronger than he though they failed in calling his up to
them

Then deliberately his eyes lifted to hers I was wishing you could
see me fight just once

She made a gesture of disgust and his face fell It came to her sharply
that the rival had thrust between and was bearing him away

IId like to she said hastily with an effort striving after that
sympathy which weakens the strongest men and draws their heads to womens
breasts

Will you

Again his eyes lifted and looked into hers He meant itshe knew that
It seemed a challenge to the greatness of her love

It would be the proudest moment of my life he said simply

It may have been the apprehensiveness of love the wish to meet his need
for her sympathy and the desire to see the Game face to face for
wisdoms sakeand it may have been the clarion call of adventure
ringing through the narrow confines of uneventful existence for a great
daring thrilled through her and she said just as simply I will

I didnt think you would or I wouldnt have asked he confessed as
they walked out to the sidewalk

But cant it be done she asked anxiously before her resolution could
cool

Oh I can fix that but I didnt think you would

I didnt think you would he repeated still amazed as he helped her
upon the electric car and felt in his pocket for the fare




CHAPTER II


Genevieve and Joe were workingclass aristocrats In an environment made
up largely of sordidness and wretchedness they had kept themselves
unsullied and wholesome Theirs was a selfrespect a regard for the
niceties and clean things of life which had held them aloof from their
kind Friends did not come to them easily nor had either ever possessed
a really intimate friend a heartcompanion with whom to chum and have
things in common The social instinct was strong in them yet they had
remained lonely because they could not satisfy that instinct and at that
same time satisfy their desire for cleanness and decency

If ever a girl of the working class had led the sheltered life it was
Genevieve In the midst of roughness and brutality she had shunned all
that was rough and brutal She saw but what she chose to see and she
chose always to see the best avoiding coarseness and uncouthness without
effort as a matter of instinct To begin with she had been peculiarly
unexposed An only child with an invalid mother upon whom she attended
she had not joined in the street games and frolics of the children of the
neighbourhood Her father a mildtempered narrowchested anaemic
little clerk domestic because of his inherent disability to mix with
men had done his full share toward giving the home an atmosphere of
sweetness and tenderness

An orphan at twelve Genevieve had gone straight from her fathers
funeral to live with the Silversteins in their rooms above the candy
store and here sheltered by kindly aliens she earned her keep and
clothes by waiting on the shop Being Gentile she was especially
necessary to the Silversteins who would not run the business themselves
when the day of their Sabbath came round

And here in the uneventful little shop six maturing years had slipped
by Her acquaintances were few She had elected to have no girl chum
for the reason that no satisfactory girl had appeared Nor did she
choose to walk with the young fellows of the neighbourhood as was the
custom of girls from their fifteenth year That stuckup dollface
was the way the girls of the neighbourhood described her and though she
earned their enmity by her beauty and aloofness she none the less
commanded their respect Peaches and cream she was called by the
young menthough softly and amongst themselves for they were afraid of
arousing the ire of the other girls while they stood in awe of
Genevieve in a dimly religious way as a something mysteriously
beautiful and unapproachable

For she was indeed beautiful Springing from a long line of American
descent she was one of those wonderful workingclass blooms which
occasionally appear defying all precedent of forebears and environment
apparently without cause or explanation She was a beauty in color the
blood spraying her white skin so deliciously as to earn for her the apt
description peaches and cream She was a beauty in the regularity of
her features and if for no other reason she was a beauty in the mere
delicacy of the lines on which she was moulded Quiet lowvoiced
stately and dignified she somehow had the knack of dress and but
befitted her beauty and dignity with anything she put on Withal she
was sheerly feminine tender and soft and clinging with the smouldering
passion of the mate and the motherliness of the woman But this side of
her nature had lain dormant through the years waiting for the mate to
appear

Then Joe came into Silversteins shop one hot Saturday afternoon to cool
himself with icecream soda She had not noticed his entrance being
busy with one other customer an urchin of six or seven who gravely
analyzed his desires before the showcase wherein truly generous and
marvellous candy creations reposed under a cardboard announcement Five
for Five Cents

She had heard Icecream soda please and had herself asked What
flavor without seeing his face For that matter it was not a custom
of hers to notice young men There was something about them she did not
understand The way they looked at her made her uncomfortable she knew
not why while there was an uncouthness and roughness about them that did
not please her As yet her imagination had been untouched by man The
young fellows she had seen had held no lure for her had been without
meaning to her In short had she been asked to give one reason for the
existence of men on the earth she would have been nonplussed for a
reply

As she emptied the measure of icecream into the glass her casual glance
rested on Joes face and she experienced on the instant a pleasant
feeling of satisfaction The next instant his eyes were upon her face
her eyes had dropped and she was turning away toward the soda fountain
But at the fountain filling the glass she was impelled to look at him
againbut for no more than an instant for this time she found his eyes
already upon her waiting to meet hers while on his face was a frankness
of interest that caused her quickly to look away

That such pleasingness would reside for her in any man astonished her
What a pretty boy she thought to herself innocently and instinctively
trying to ward off the power to hold and draw her that lay behind the
mere prettiness Besides he isnt pretty she thought as she placed
the glass before him received the silver dime in payment and for the
third time looked into his eyes Her vocabulary was limited and she
knew little of the worth of words but the strong masculinity of his
boys face told her that the term was inappropriate

He must be handsome then was her next thought as she again dropped
her eyes before his But all goodlooking men were called handsome and
that term too displeased her But whatever it was he was good to see
and she was irritably aware of a desire to look at him again and again

As for Joe he had never seen anything like this girl across the counter
While he was wiser in natural philosophy than she and could have given
immediately the reason for womans existence on the earth nevertheless
woman had no part in his cosmos His imagination was as untouched by
woman as the girls was by man But his imagination was touched now and
the woman was Genevieve He had never dreamed a girl could be so
beautiful and he could not keep his eyes from her face Yet every time
he looked at her and her eyes met his he felt painful embarrassment
and would have looked away had not her eyes dropped so quickly

But when at last she slowly lifted her eyes and held their gaze
steadily it was his own eyes that dropped his own cheek that mantled
red She was much less embarrassed than he while she betrayed her
embarrassment not at all She was aware of a flutter within such as she
had never known before but in no way did it disturb her outward
serenity Joe on the contrary was obviously awkward and delightfully
miserable

Neither knew love and all that either was aware was an overwhelming
desire to look at the other Both had been troubled and roused and they
were drawing together with the sharpness and imperativeness of uniting
elements He toyed with his spoon and flushed his embarrassment over
his soda but lingered on and she spoke softly dropped her eyes and
wove her witchery about him

But he could not linger forever over a glass of icecream soda while he
did not dare ask for a second glass So he left her to remain in the
shop in a waking trance and went away himself down the street like a
somnambulist Genevieve dreamed through the afternoon and knew that she
was in love Not so with Joe He knew only that he wanted to look at
her again to see her face His thoughts did not get beyond this and
besides it was scarcely a thought being more a dim and inarticulate
desire

The urge of this desire he could not escape Day after day it worried
him and the candy shop and the girl behind the counter continually
obtruded themselves He fought off the desire He was afraid and
ashamed to go back to the candy shop He solaced his fear with I aint
a ladies man Not once nor twice but scores of times he muttered
the thought to himself but it did no good And by the middle of the
week in the evening after work he came into the shop He tried to
come in carelessly and casually but his whole carriage advertised the
strong effort of will that compelled his legs to carry his reluctant body
thither Also he was shy and awkwarder than ever Genevieve on the
contrary was serener than ever though fluttering most alarmingly
within He was incapable of speech mumbled his order looked anxiously
at the clock despatched his icecream soda in tremendous haste and was
gone

She was ready to weep with vexation Such meagre reward for four days
waiting and assuming all the time that she loved He was a nice boy and
all that she knew but he neednt have been in so disgraceful a hurry
But Joe had not reached the corner before he wanted to be back with her
again He just wanted to look at her He had no thought that it was
love Love That was when young fellows and girls walked out together
As for himAnd then his desire took sharper shape and he discovered
that that was the very thing he wanted her to do He wanted to see her
to look at her and well could he do all this if she but walked out with
him Then that was why the young fellows and girls walked out together
he mused as the weekend drew near He had remotely considered this
walking out to be a mere form or observance preliminary to matrimony Now
he saw the deeper wisdom in it wanted it himself and concluded
therefrom that he was in love

Both were now of the same mind and there could be but the one ending
and it was the mild nine days wonder of Genevieves neighborhood when
she and Joe walked out together

Both were blessed with an avarice of speech and because of it their
courtship was a long one As he expressed himself in action she
expressed herself in repose and control and by the lovelight in her
eyesthough this latter she would have suppressed in all maiden modesty
had she been conscious of the speech her heart printed so plainly there
Dear and darling were too terribly intimate for them to achieve
quickly and unlike most mating couples they did not overwork the love
words For a long time they were content to walk together in the
evenings or to sit side by side on a bench in the park neither uttering
a word for an hour at a time merely gazing into each others eyes too
faintly luminous in the starshine to be a cause for selfconsciousness
and embarrassment

He was as chivalrous and delicate in his attention as any knight to his
lady When they walked along the street he was careful to be on the
outsidesomewhere he had heard that this was the proper thing to
doand when a crossing to the opposite side of the street put him on
the inside he swiftly sidestepped behind her to gain the outside again
He carried her parcels for her and once when rain threatened her
umbrella He had never heard of the custom of sending flowers to ones
ladylove so he sent Genevieve fruit instead There was utility in
fruit It was good to eat Flowers never entered his mind until one
day he noticed a pale rose in her hair It drew his gaze again and
again It was _her_ hair therefore the presence of the flower
interested him Again it interested him because _she_ had chosen to put
it there For these reasons he was led to observe the rose more closely
He discovered that the effect in itself was beautiful and it fascinated
him His ingenuous delight in it was a delight to her and a new and
mutual lovethrill was theirsbecause of a flower Straightway he
became a lover of flowers Also he became an inventor in gallantry He
sent her a bunch of violets The idea was his own He had never heard
of a man sending flowers to a woman Flowers were used for decorative
purposes also for funerals He sent Genevieve flowers nearly every day
and so far as he was concerned the idea was original as positive an
invention as ever arose in the mind of man

He was tremulous in his devotion to heras tremulous as was she in her
reception of him She was all that was pure and good a holy of holies
not lightly to be profaned even by what might possibly be the too ardent
reverence of a devotee She was a being wholly different from any he had
ever known She was not as other girls It never entered his head that
she was of the same clay as his own sisters or anybodys sister She
was more than mere girl than mere woman She waswell she was
Genevieve a being of a class by herself nothing less than a miracle of
creation

And for her in turn there was in him but little less of illusion Her
judgment of him in minor things might be critical while his judgment of
her was sheer worship and had in it nothing critical at all but in her
judgment of him as a whole she forgot the sum of the parts and knew him
only as a creature of wonder who gave meaning to life and for whom she
could die as willingly as she could live She often beguiled her waking
dreams of him with fancied situations wherein dying for him she at
last adequately expressed the love she felt for him and which living
she knew she could never fully express

Their love was all fire and dew The physical scarcely entered into it
for such seemed profanation The ultimate physical facts of their
relation were something which they never considered Yet the immediate
physical facts they knew the immediate yearnings and raptures of the
fleshthe touch of finger tips on hand or arm the momentary pressure of
a handclasp the rare lipcaress of a kiss the tingling thrill of her
hair upon his cheek of her hand lightly thrusting back the locks from
above his eyes All this they knew but also and they knew not why
there seemed a hint of sin about these caresses and sweet bodily
contacts

There were times when she felt impelled to throw her arms around him in a
very abandonment of love but always some sanctity restrained her At
such moments she was distinctly and unpleasantly aware of some unguessed
sin that lurked within her It was wrong undoubtedly wrong that she
should wish to caress her lover in so unbecoming a fashion No
selfrespecting girl could dream of doing such a thing It was
unwomanly Besides if she had done it what would he have thought of
it And while she contemplated so horrible a catastrophe she seemed to
shrivel and wilt in a furnace of secret shame

Nor did Joe escape the prick of curious desires chiefest among which
perhaps was the desire to hurt Genevieve When after long and tortuous
degrees he had achieved the bliss of putting his arm round her waist he
felt spasmodic impulses to make the embrace crushing till she should cry
out with the hurt It was not his nature to wish to hurt any living
thing Even in the ring to hurt was never the intention of any blow he
struck In such case he played the Game and the goal of the Game was to
down an antagonist and keep that antagonist down for a space of ten
seconds So he never struck merely to hurt the hurt was incidental to
the end and the end was quite another matter And yet here with this
girl he loved came the desire to hurt Why when with thumb and
forefinger he had ringed her wrist he should desire to contract that
ring till it crushed was beyond him He could not understand and felt
that he was discovering depths of brutality in his nature of which he had
never dreamed

Once on parting he threw his arms around her and swiftly drew her
against him Her gasping cry of surprise and pain brought him to his
senses and left him there very much embarrassed and still trembling with
a vague and nameless delight And she too was trembling In the hurt
itself which was the essence of the vigorous embrace she had found
delight and again she knew sin though she knew not its nature nor why
it should be sin

Came the day very early in their walking out when Silverstein chanced
upon Joe in his store and stared at him with saucereyes Came likewise
the scene after Joe had departed when the maternal feelings of Mrs
Silverstein found vent in a diatribe against all prizefighters and
against Joe Fleming in particular Vainly had Silverstein striven to
stay the spouses wrath There was need for her wrath All the maternal
feelings were hers but none of the maternal rights

Genevieve was aware only of the diatribe she knew a flood of abuse was
pouring from the lips of the Jewess but she was too stunned to hear the
details of the abuse Joe her Joe was Joe Fleming the prizefighter
It was abhorrent impossible too grotesque to be believable Her clear
eyed girlcheeked Joe might be anything but a prizefighter She had
never seen one but he in no way resembled her conception of what a prize
fighter must bethe human brute with tiger eyes and a streak for a
forehead Of course she had heard of Joe Flemingwho in West Oakland
had notbut that there should be anything more than a coincidence of
names had never crossed her mind

She came out of her daze to hear Mrs Silversteins hysterical sneer
keepin company vit a bruiser Next Silverstein and his wife fell to
differing on noted and notorious as applicable to her lover

But he iss a good boy Silverstein was contending He make der money
an he safe der money

You tell me dat Mrs Silverstein screamed Vat you know You know
too much You spend good money on der prizefighters How you know
Tell me dat How you know

I know vat I know Silverstein held on sturdilya thing Genevieve had
never before seen him do when his wife was in her tantrums His fader

sisters younger as he iss He iss der liddle fader He vork hard all

buy der piano for der sisters der carpets der pictures on der vall An
he iss all der time straight He bet on himselfdat iss der good sign
Ven der man bets on himself dat is der time you bet too

Here Mrs Silverstein groaned her horror of gambling and her husband
aware that his eloquence had betrayed him collapsed into voluble
assurances that he was ahead of the game An all because of Joe
Fleming he concluded I back him efery time to vin

But Genevieve and Joe were preeminently mated and nothing not even this
terrible discovery could keep them apart In vain Genevieve tried to
steel herself against him but she fought herself not him To her
surprise she discovered a thousand excuses for him found him lovable as
ever and she entered into his life to be his destiny and to control him
after the way of women She saw his future and hers through glowing
vistas of reform and her first great deed was when she wrung from him
his promise to cease fighting

And he after the way of men pursuing the dream of love and striving for
possession of the precious and deathless object of desire had yielded
And yet in the very moment of promising her he knew vaguely deep down
that he could never abandon the Game that somewhere sometime in the
future he must go back to it And he had had a swift vision of his
mother and brothers and sisters their multitudinous wants the house
with its painting and repairing its street assessments and taxes and of
the coming of children to him and Genevieve and of his own daily wage in
the sailmaking loft But the next moment the vision was dismissed as
such warnings are always dismissed and he saw before him only Genevieve
and he knew only his hunger for her and the call of his being to her and
he accepted calmly her calm assumption of his life and actions

He was twenty she was eighteen boy and girl the pair of them and made
for progeny healthy and normal with steady blood pounding through their
bodies and wherever they went together even on Sunday outings across
the bay amongst people who did not know him eyes were continually drawn
to them He matched her girls beauty with his boys beauty her grace
with his strength her delicacy of line and fibre with the harsher vigor
and muscle of the male Frankfaced freshcolored almost ingenuous in
expression eyes blue and wide apart he drew and held the gaze of more
than one woman far above him in the social scale Of such glances and
dim maternal promptings he was quite unconscious though Genevieve was
quick to see and understand and she knew each time the pang of a fierce
joy in that he was hers and that she held him in the hollow of her hand
He did see however and rather resented the mens glances drawn by her
These too she saw and understood as he did not dream of understanding




CHAPTER III


Genevieve slipped on a pair of Joes shoes lightsoled and dapper and
laughed with Lottie who stooped to turn up the trousers for her Lottie
was his sister and in the secret To her was due the inveigling of his
mother into making a neighborhood call so that they could have the house
to themselves They went down into the kitchen where Joe was waiting
His face brightened as he came to meet her love shining frankly forth

Now get up those skirts Lottie he commanded Havent any time to
waste There thatll do You see you only want the bottoms of the
pants to show The coat will cover the rest Now lets see how itll
fit

Borrowed it from Chris hes a dead sporty sportlittle but oh my
he went on helping Genevieve into an overcoat which fell to her heels
and which fitted her as a tailormade overcoat should fit the man for
whom it is made

Joe put a cap on her head and turned up the collar which was generous to
exaggeration meeting the cap and completely hiding her hair When he
buttoned the collar in front its points served to cover the cheeks chin
and mouth were buried in its depths and a close scrutiny revealed only
shadowy eyes and a little less shadowy nose She walked across the room
the bottom of the trousers just showing as the bang of the coat was
disturbed by movement

A sport with a cold and afraid of catching more all right all right
the boy laughed proudly surveying his handiwork How much money you
got Im layin ten to six Will you take the short end

Whos short she asked

Ponta of course Lottie blurted out her hurt as though there could be
any question of it even for an instant

Of course Genevieve said sweetly only I dont know much about such
things

This time Lottie kept her lips together but the new hurt showed on her
face Joe looked at his watch and said it was time to go His sisters
arms went about his neck and she kissed him soundly on the lips She
kissed Genevieve too and saw them to the gate one arm of her brother
about her waist

What does ten to six mean Genevieve asked the while their footfalls
rang out on the frosty air

That Im the long end the favorite he answered That a man bets ten
dollars at the ring side that I win against six dollars another man is
betting that I lose

But if youre the favorite and everybody thinks youll win how does
anybody bet against you

Thats what makes prizefightingdifference of opinion he laughed
Besides theres always the chance of a lucky punch an accident Lots
of chance he said gravely

She shrank against him clingingly and protectingly and he laughed with
surety

You wait and youll see An dont get scared at the start The first
few roundsll be something fierce Thats Pontas strong point Hes a
wild man with an kinds of punchesa whirlwindand he gets his man in
the first rounds Hes put away a whole lot of cleverer and better men
than him Its up to me to live through it thats all Then hell be
all in Then I go after him just watch Youll know when I go after
him an Ill getm too

They came to the hall on a dark streetcorner ostensibly the quarters
of an athletic club but in reality an institution designed for pulling
off fights and keeping within the police ordinance Joe drew away from
her and they walked apart to the entrance

Keep your hands in your pockets whatever you do Joe warned her and
itll be all right Only a couple of minutes of it

Hes with me Joe said to the doorkeeper who was talking with a
policeman

Both men greeted him familiarly taking no notice of his companion

They never tumbled nobodyll tumble Joe assured her as they climbed
the stairs to the second story And even if they did they wouldnt
know who it was and theys keep it mum for me Here come in here

He whisked her into a little officelike room and left her seated on a
dusty brokenbottomed chair A few minutes later he was back again
clad in a long bath robe canvas shoes on his feet She began to tremble
against him and his arm passed gently around her

Itll be all right Genevieve he said encouragingly Ive got it all
fixed Nobodyll tumble

Its you Joe she said I dont care for myself Its you

Dont care for yourself But thats what I thought you were afraid of

He looked at her in amazement the wonder of woman bursting upon him in a
more transcendent glory than ever and he had seen much of the wonder of
woman in Genevieve He was speechless for a moment and then stammered

You mean me And you dont care what people think or anythingor
anything

A sharp double knock at the door and a sharper Get a move on yerself
Joe brought him back to immediate things

Quick one last kiss Genevieve he whispered almost holily Its my
last fight an Ill fight as never before with you lookin at me

The next she knew the pressure of his lips yet warm on hers she was in
a group of jostling young fellows none of whom seemed to take the
slightest notice of her Several had their coats off and their shirt
sleeves rolled up They entered the hall from the rear still keeping
the casual formation of the group and moved slowly up a side aisle

It was a crowded illlighted hall barnlike in its proportions and the
smokeladen air gave a peculiar distortion to everything She felt as
though she would stifle There were shrill cries of boys selling
programmes and soda water and there was a great bass rumble of masculine
voices She heard a voice offering ten to six on Joe Fleming The
utterance was monotonoushopeless it seemed to her and she felt a
quick thrill It was her Joe against whom everybody was to bet

And she felt other thrills Her blood was touched as by fire with
romance adventurethe unknown the mysterious the terribleas she
penetrated this haunt of men where women came not And there were other
thrills It was the only time in her life she had dared the rash thing
For the first time she was overstepping the bounds laid down by that
harshest of tyrants the Mrs Grundy of the working class She felt
fear and for herself though the moment before she had been thinking
only of Joe

Before she knew it the front of the hall had been reached and she had
gone up half a dozen steps into a small dressingroom This was crowded
to suffocationby men who played the Game she concluded in one
capacity or another And here she lost Joe But before the real
personal fright could soundly clutch her one of the young fellows said
gruffly Come along with me you and as she wedged out at his heels
she noticed that another one of the escort was following her

They came upon a sort of stage which accommodated three rows of men and
she caught her first glimpse of the squared ring She was on a level
with it and so near that she could have reached out and touched its
ropes She noticed that it was covered with padded canvas Beyond the
ring and on either side as in a fog she could see the crowded house

The dressingroom she had left abutted upon one corner of the ring
Squeezing her way after her guide through the seated men she crossed the
end of the hall and entered a similar dressingroom at the other corner
of the ring

Now dont make a noise and stay here till I come for you instructed
her guide pointing out a peephole arrangement in the wall of the room




CHAPTER IV


She hurried to the peephole and found herself against the ring She
could see the whole of it though part of the audience was shut off The
ring was well lighted by an overhead cluster of patent gasburners The
front row of the men she had squeezed past because of their paper and
pencils she decided to be reporters from the local papers uptown One
of them was chewing gum Behind them on the other two rows of seats
she could make out firemen from the nearby enginehouse and several
policemen in uniform In the middle of the front row flanked by the
reporters sat the young chief of police She was startled by catching
sight of Mr Clausen on the opposite side of the ring There he sat
austere sidewhiskered pink and white close up against the front of
the ring Several seats farther on in the same front row she
discovered Silverstein his weazen features glowing with anticipation

A few cheers heralded the advent of several young fellows in
shirtsleeves carrying buckets bottles and towels who crawled through
the ropes and crossed to the diagonal corner from her One of them sat
down on a stool and leaned back against the ropes She saw that he was
barelegged with canvas shoes on his feet and that his body was swathed
in a heavy white sweater In the meantime another group had occupied the
corner directly against her Louder cheers drew her attention to it and
she saw Joe seated on a stool still clad in the bath robe his short
chestnut curls within a yard of her eyes

A young man in a black suit with a mop of hair and a preposterously
tall starched collar walked to the centre of the ring and held up his
hand

Gentlemen will please stop smoking he said

His effort was applauded by groans and catcalls and she noticed with
indignation that nobody stopped smoking Mr Clausen held a burning
match in his fingers while the announcement was being made and then
calmly lighted his cigar She felt that she hated him in that moment
How was her Joe to fight in such an atmosphere She could scarcely
breathe herself and she was only sitting down

The announcer came over to Joe He stood up His bath robe fell away
from him and he stepped forth to the centre of the ring naked save for
the low canvas shoes and a narrow hipcloth of white Genevieves eyes
dropped She sat alone with none to see but her face was burning with
shame at sight of the beautiful nakedness of her lover But she looked
again guiltily for the joy that was hers in beholding what she knew
must be sinful to behold The leap of something within her and the stir
of her being toward him must be sinful But it was delicious sin and
she did not deny her eyes In vain Mrs Grundy admonished her The
pagan in her original sin and all nature urged her on The mothers of
all the past were whispering through her and there was a clamour of the
children unborn But of this she knew nothing She knew only that it
was sin and she lifted her head proudly recklessly resolved in one
great surge of revolt to sin to the uttermost

She had never dreamed of the form under the clothes The form beyond
the hands and the face had no part in her mental processes A child of
garmented civilization the garment was to her the form The race of men
was to her a race of garmented bipeds with hands and faces and
haircovered heads When she thought of Joe the Joe instantly
visualized on her mind was a clothed Joegirlcheeked blueeyed curly
headed but clothed And there he stood all but naked godlike in a
white blaze of light She had never conceived of the form of God except
as nebulously naked and the thoughtassociation was startling It
seemed to her that her sin partook of sacrilege or blasphemy

Her chromotrained aesthetic sense exceeded its education and told her
that here were beauty and wonder She had always liked the physical
presentment of Joe but it was a presentment of clothes and she had
thought the pleasingness of it due to the neatness and taste with which
he dressed She had never dreamed that this lurked beneath It dazzled
her His skin was fair as a womans far more satiny and no rudimentary
hairgrowth marred its white lustre This she perceived but all the
rest the perfection of line and strength and development gave pleasure
without her knowing why There was a cleanness and grace about it His
face was like a cameo and his lips parted in a smile made it very
boyish

He smiled as he faced the audience when the announcer placing a hand on
his shoulder said Joe Fleming the Pride of West Oakland

Cheers and handclappings stormed up and she heard affectionate cries of
Oh you Joe Men shouted it at him again and again

He walked back to his corner Never to her did he seem less a fighter
than then His eyes were too mild there was not a spark of the beast in
them nor in his face while his body seemed too fragile what of its
fairness and smoothness and his face too boyish and sweettempered and
intelligent She did not have the experts eye for the depth of chest
the wide nostrils the recuperative lungs and the muscles under their
satin sheathscrypts of energy wherein lurked the chemistry of
destruction To her he looked like a something of Dresden china to be
handled gently and with care liable to be shattered to fragments by the
first rough touch

John Ponta stripped of his white sweater by the pulling and hauling of
two of his seconds came to the centre of the ring She knew terror as
she looked at him Here was the fighterthe beast with a streak for a
forehead with beady eyes under lowering and bushy brows flatnosed
thicklipped sullenmouthed He was heavyjawed bullnecked and the
short straight hair of the head seemed to her frightened eyes the stiff
bristles on a hogs back Here were coarseness and brutishnessa thing
savage primordial ferocious He was swarthy to blackness and his body
was covered with a hairy growth that matted like a dogs on his chest and
shoulders He was deepchested thicklegged largemuscled but
unshapely His muscles were knots and he was gnarled and knobby
twisted out of beauty by excess of strength

John Ponta West Bay Athletic Club said the announcer

A much smaller volume of cheers greeted him It was evident that the
crowd favored Joe with its sympathy

Go in an eat m Ponta Eat m up a voice shouted in the lull

This was received by scornful cries and groans He did not like it for
his sullen mouth twisted into a halfsnarl as he went back to his corner
He was too decided an atavism to draw the crowds admiration
Instinctively the crowd disliked him He was an animal lacking in
intelligence and spirit a menace and a thing of fear as the tiger and
the snake are menaces and things of fear better behind the bars of a
cage than running free in the open

And he felt that the crowd had no relish for him He was like an animal
in the circle of its enemies and he turned and glared at them with
malignant eyes Little Silverstein shouting out Joes name with high
glee shrank away from Pontas gaze shrivelled as in fierce heat the
sound gurgling and dying in his throat Genevieve saw the little
byplay and as Pontas eyes slowly swept round the circle of their hate
and met hers she too shrivelled and shrank back The next moment they
were past pausing to centre long on Joe It seemed to her that Ponta
was working himself into a rage Joe returned the gaze with mild boys
eyes but his face grew serious

The announcer escorted a third man to the centre of the ring a genial
faced young fellow in shirtsleeves

Eddy Jones who will referee this contest said the announcer

Oh you Eddy men shouted in the midst of the applause and it was
apparent to Genevieve that he too was well beloved

Both men were being helped into the gloves by their seconds and one of
Pontas seconds came over and examined the gloves before they went on
Joes hands The referee called them to the centre of the ring The
seconds followed and they made quite a group Joe and Ponta facing each
other the referee in the middle the seconds leaning with hands on one
anothers shoulders their heads craned forward The referee was
talking and all listened attentively

The group broke up Again the announcer came to the front

Joe Fleming fights at one hundred and twentyeight he said John
Ponta at one hundred and forty They will fight as long as one hand is
free and take care of themselves in the breakaway The audience must
remember that a decision must be given There are no draws fought before
this club

He crawled through the ropes and dropped from the ring to the floor
There was a scuttling in the corners as the seconds cleared out through
the ropes taking with them the stools and buckets Only remained in the
ring the two fighters and the referee A gong sounded The two men
advanced rapidly to the centre Their right hands extended and for a
fraction of an instant met in a perfunctory shake Then Ponta lashed
out savagely right and left and Joe escaped by springing back Like a
projectile Ponta hurled himself after him and upon him

The fight was on Genevieve clutched one hand to her breast and watched
She was bewildered by the swiftness and savagery of Pontas assault and
by the multitude of blows he struck She felt that Joe was surely being
destroyed At times she could not see his face so obscured was it by
the flying gloves But she could hear the resounding blows and with the
sound of each blow she felt a sickening sensation in the pit of her
stomach She did not know that what she heard was the impact of glove on
glove or glove on shoulder and that no damage was being done

She was suddenly aware that a change had come over the fight Both men
were clutching each other in a tense embrace no blows were being struck
at all She recognized it to be what Joe had described to her as the
clinch Ponta was struggling to free himself Joe was holding on

The referee shouted Break Joe made an effort to get away but Ponta
got one hand free and Joe rushed back into a second clinch to escape the
blow But this time she noticed the heel of his glove was pressed
against Pontas mouth and chin and at the second Break of the
referee Joe shoved his opponents head back and sprang clear himself

For a brief several seconds she had an unobstructed view of her lover
Left foot a trifle advanced knees slightly bent he was crouching with
his head drawn well down between his shoulders and shielded by them His
hands were in position before him ready either to attack or defend The
muscles of his body were tense and as he moved about she could see them
bunch up and writhe and crawl like live things under the white skin

But again Ponta was upon him and he was struggling to live He crouched
a bit more drew his body more compactly together and covered up with
his hands elbows and forearms Blows rained upon him and it looked to
her as though he were being beaten to death

But he was receiving the blows on his gloves and shoulders rocking back
and forth to the force of them like a tree in a storm while the house
cheered its delight It was not until she understood this applause and
saw Silverstein half out of his seat and intensely madly happy and
heard the Oh you Joes from many throats that she realized that
instead of being cruelly punished he was acquitting himself well Then
he would emerge for a moment again to be enveloped and hidden in the
whirlwind of Pontas ferocity




CHAPTER V


The gong sounded It seemed they had been fighting half an hour though
from what Joe had told her she knew it had been only three minutes With
the crash of the gong Joes seconds were through the ropes and running
him into his corner for the blessed minute of rest One man squatting
on the floor between his outstretched feet and elevating them by resting
them on his knees was violently chafing his legs Joe sat on the stool
leaning far back into the corner head thrown back and arms outstretched
on the ropes to give easy expansion to the chest With wideopen mouth
he was breathing the toweldriven air furnished by two of the seconds
while listening to the counsel of still another second who talked with
low voice in his ear and at the same time sponged off his face
shoulders and chest

Hardly had all this been accomplished it had taken no more than several
seconds when the gong sounded the seconds scuttled through the ropes
with their paraphernalia and Joe and Ponta were advancing against each
other to the centre of the ring Genevieve had no idea that a minute
could be so short For a moment she felt that this rest had been cut
and was suspicious of she knew not what

Ponta lashed out right and left savagely as ever and though Joe
blocked the blows such was the force of them that he was knocked
backward several steps Ponta was after him with the spring of a tiger
In the involuntary effort to maintain equilibrium Joe had uncovered
himself flinging one arm out and lifting his head from beneath the
sheltering shoulders So swiftly had Ponta followed him that a terrible
swinging blow was coming at his unguarded jaw He ducked forward and
down Pontas fist just missing the back of his head As he came back to
the perpendicular Pontas left fist drove at him in a straight punch
that would have knocked him backward through the ropes Again and with
a swiftness an inappreciable fraction of time quicker than Pontas he
ducked forward Pontas fist grazed the backward slope of the shoulder
and glanced off into the air Pontas right drove straight out and the
graze was repeated as Joe ducked into the safety of a clinch

Genevieve sighed with relief her tense body relaxing and a faintness
coming over her The crowd was cheering madly Silverstein was on his
feet shouting gesticulating completely out of himself And even Mr
Clausen was yelling his enthusiasm at the top of his lungs into the ear
of his nearest neighbor

The clinch was broken and the fight went on Joe blocked and backed
and slid around the ring avoiding blows and living somehow through the
whirlwind onslaughts Rarely did he strike blows himself for Ponta had
a quick eye and could defend as well as attack while Joe had no chance
against the others enormous vitality His hope lay in that Ponta
himself should ultimately consume his strength

But Genevieve was beginning to wonder why her lover did not fight She
grew angry She wanted to see him wreak vengeance on this beast that had
persecuted him so Even as she waxed impatient the chance came and Joe
whipped his fist to Pontas mouth It was a staggering blow She saw
Pontas head go back with a jerk and the quick dye of blood upon his
lips The blow and the great shout from the audience angered him He
rushed like a wild man The fury of his previous assaults was as nothing
compared with the fury of this one And there was no more opportunity
for another blow Joe was too busy living through the storm he had
already caused blocking covering up and ducking into the safety and
respite of the clinches

But the clinch was not all safety and respite Every instant of it was
intense watchfulness while the breakaway was still more dangerous
Genevieve had noticed with a slight touch of amusement the curious way
in which Joe snuggled his body in against Pontas in the clinches but
she had not realized why until in one such clinch before the snuggling
in could be effected Pontas fist whipped straight up in the air from
under and missed Joes chin by a hairsbreadth In another and later
clinch when she had already relaxed and sighed her relief at seeing him
safely snuggled Ponta his chin over Joes shoulder lifted his right
arm and struck a terrible downward blow on the small of the back The
crowd groaned its apprehension while Joe quickly locked his opponents
arms to prevent a repetition of the blow

The gong struck and after the fleeting minute of rest they went at it
againin Joes corner for Ponta had made a rush to meet him clear
across the ring Where the blow had been over the kidneys the white
skin had become bright red This splash of color the size of the glove
fascinated and frightened Genevieve so that she could scarcely take her
eyes from it Promptly in the next clinch the blow was repeated but
after that Joe usually managed to give Ponta the heel of the glove on the
mouth and so hold his head back This prevented the striking of the
blow but three times more before the round ended Ponta effected the
trick each time striking the same vulnerable part

Another rest and another round went by with no further damage to Joe and
no diminution of strength on the part of Ponta But in the beginning of
the fifth round Joe caught in a corner made as though to duck into a
clinch Just before it was effected and at the precise moment that
Ponta was ready with his own body to receive the snuggling in of Joes
body Joe drew back slightly and drove with his fists at his opponents
unprotected stomach Lightninglike blows they were four of them right
and left and heavy they were for Ponta winced away from them and
staggered back half dropping his arms his shoulders drooping forward
and in as though he were about to double in at the waist and collapse
Joes quick eye saw the opening and he smashed straight out upon Pontas
mouth following instantly with a half swing half hook for the jaw It
missed striking the cheek instead and sending Ponta staggering
sideways

The house was on its feet shouting to a man Genevieve could hear men
crying Hes got m hes got m and it seemed to her the beginning of
the end She too was out of herself softness and tenderness had
vanished she exulted with each crushing blow her lover delivered

But Pontas vitality was yet to be reckoned with As like a tiger he
had followed Joe up Joe now followed him up He made another half
swing half hook for Pontas jaw and Ponta already recovering his wits
and strength ducked cleanly Joes fist passed on through empty air
and so great was the momentum of the blow that it carried him around in
a half twirl sideways Then Ponta lashed out with his left His glove
landed on Joes unguarded neck Genevieve saw her lovers arms drop to
his sides as his body lifted went backward and fell limply to the
floor The referee bending over him began to count the seconds
emphasizing the passage of each second with a downward sweep of his right
arm

The audience was still as death Ponta had partly turned to the house to
receive the approval that was his due only to be met by this chill
graveyard silence Quick wrath surged up in him It was unfair His
opponent only was applaudedif he struck a blow if he escaped a blow
he Ponta who had forced the fighting from the start had received no
word of cheer

His eyes blazed as he gathered himself together and sprang to his
prostrate foe He crouched alongside of him right arm drawn back and
ready for a smashing blow the instant Joe should start to rise The
referee still bending over and counting with his right hand shoved
Ponta back with his left The latter crouching circled around and the
referee circled with him thrusting him back and keeping between him and
the fallen man

Fourfivesix the count went on and Joe rolling over on his face
squirmed weakly to draw himself to his knees This he succeeded in
doing resting on one knee a hand to the floor on either side and the
other leg bent under him to help him rise Take the count Take the
count a dozen voices rang out from the audience

For Gods sake take the count one of Joes seconds cried warningly
from the edge of the ring Genevieve gave him one swift glance and saw
the young fellows face drawn and white his lips unconsciously moving
as he kept the count with the referee

Seveneightnine the seconds went

The ninth sounded and was gone when the referee gave Ponta a last
backward shove and Joe came to his feet bunched up covered up weak
but cool very cool Ponta hurled himself upon him with terrific force
delivering an uppercut and a straight punch But Joe blocked the two
ducked a third stepped to the side to avoid a fourth and was then
driven backward into a corner by a hurricane of blows He was
exceedingly weak He tottered as he kept his footing and staggered back
and forth His back was against the ropes There was no further
retreat Ponta paused as if to make doubly sure then feinted with his
left and struck fiercely with his right with all his strength But Joe
ducked into a clinch and was for a moment saved

Ponta struggled frantically to free himself He wanted to give the
finish to this foe already so far gone But Joe was holding on for life
resisting the others every effort as fast as one hold or grip was torn
loose finding a new one by which to cling Break the referee
commanded Joe held on tighter Make m break Why the hell dont you
make m break Ponta panted at the referee Again the latter commanded
the break Joe refused keeping as he well knew within his rights
Each moment of the clinch his strength was coming back to him his brain
was clearing the cobwebs were disappearing from before his eyes The
round was young and he must live somehow through the nearly three
minutes of it yet to run

The referee clutched each by the shoulder and sundered them violently
passing quickly between them as he thrust them backward in order to make
a clean break of it The moment he was free Ponta sprang at Joe like a
wild animal bearing down its prey But Joe covered up blocked and fell
into a clinch Again Ponta struggled to get free Joe held on and the
referee thrust them apart And again Joe avoided damage and clinched

Genevieve realized that in the clinches he was not being beatenwhy
then did not the referee let him hold on It was cruel She hated the
genialfaced Eddy Jones in those moments and she partly rose from her
chair her hands clenched with anger the nails cutting into the palms
till they hurt The rest of the round the three long minutes of it was
a succession of clinches and breaks Not once did Ponta succeed in
striking his opponent the deadly final blow And Ponta was like a
madman raging because of his impotency in the face of his helpless and
all but vanquished foe One blow only one blow and he could not
deliver it Joes ring experience and coolness saved him With shaken
consciousness and trembling body he clutched and held on while the
ebbing life turned and flooded up in him again Once in his passion
unable to hit him Ponta made as though to lift him up and hurl him to
the floor

Vy dont you bite him Silverstein taunted shrilly

In the stillness the sally was heard over the whole house and the
audience relieved of its anxiety for its favorite laughed with an
uproariousness that had in it the note of hysteria Even Genevieve felt
that there was something irresistibly funny in the remark and the relief
of the audience was communicated to her yet she felt sick and faint and
was overwrought with horror at what she had seen and was seeing

Bite m Bite m voices from the recovered audience were shouting
Chew his ear off Ponta Thats the only way you can get m Eat m
up Eat m up Oh why dont you eat m up

The effect was bad on Ponta He became more frenzied than ever and more
impotent He panted and sobbed wasting his effort by too much effort
losing sanity and control and futilely trying to compensate for the loss
by excess of physical endeavor He knew only the blind desire to
destroy shook Joe in the clinches as a terrier might a rat strained and
struggled for freedom of body and arms and all the while Joe calmly
clutched and held on The referee worked manfully and fairly to separate
them Perspiration ran down his face It took all his strength to split
those clinging bodies and no sooner had he split them than Joe fell
unharmed into another embrace and the work had to be done all over again
In vain when freed did Ponta try to avoid the clutching arms and
twining body He could not keep away He had to come close in order to
strike and each time Joe baffled him and caught him in his arms

And Genevieve crouched in the little dressingroom and peering through
the peephole was baffled too She was an interested party in what
seemed a deathstrugglewas not one of the fighters her Joebut the
audience understood and she did not The Game had not unveiled to her
The lure of it was beyond her It was greater mystery than ever She
could not comprehend its power What delight could there be for Joe in
that brutal surging and straining of bodies those fierce clutches
fiercer blows and terrible hurts Surely she Genevieve offered more
than thatrest and content and sweet calm joy Her bid for the heart
of him and the soul of him was finer and more generous than the bid of
the Game yet he dallied with bothheld her in his arms but turned his
head to listen to that other and siren call she could not understand

The gong struck The round ended with a break in Pontas corner The
whitefaced young second was through the ropes with the first clash of
sound He seized Joe in his arms lifted him clear of the floor and ran
with him across the ring to his own corner His seconds worked over him
furiously chafing his legs slapping his abdomen stretching the hip
cloth out with their fingers so that he might breathe more easily For
the first time Genevieve saw the stomachbreathing of a man an abdomen
that rose and fell far more with every breath than her breast rose and
fell after she had run for a car The pungency of ammonia bit her
nostrils wafted to her from the soaked sponge wherefrom he breathed the
fiery fumes that cleared his brain He gargled his mouth and throat
took a suck at a divided lemon and all the while the towels worked like
mad driving oxygen into his lungs to purge the pounding blood and send
it back revivified for the struggle yet to come His heated body was
sponged with water doused with it and bottles were turned
mouthdownward on his head




CHAPTER VI


The gong for the sixth round struck and both men advanced to meet each
other their bodies glistening with water Ponta rushed twothirds of
the way across the ring so intent was he on getting at his man before
full recovery could be effected But Joe had lived through He was
strong again and getting stronger He blocked several vicious blows and
then smashed back sending Ponta reeling He attempted to follow up but
wisely forbore and contented himself with blocking and covering up in the
whirlwind his blow had raised

The fight was as it had been at the beginningJoe protecting Ponta
rushing But Ponta was never at ease He did not have it all his own
way At any moment in his fiercest onslaughts his opponent was liable
to lash out and reach him Joe saved his strength He struck one blow
to Pontas ten but his one blow rarely missed Ponta overwhelmed him in
the attacks yet could do nothing with him while Joes tigerlike
strokes always imminent compelled respect They toned Pontas
ferocity He was no longer able to go in with the complete abandon of
destructiveness which had marked his earlier efforts

But a change was coming over the fight The audience was quick to note
it and even Genevieve saw it by the beginning of the ninth round Joe
was taking the offensive In the clinches it was he who brought his fist
down on the small of the back striking the terrible kidney blow He did
it once in each clinch but with all his strength and he did it every
clinch Then in the breakaways he began to uppercut Ponta on the
stomach or to hook his jaw or strike straight out upon the mouth But
at first sign of a coming of a whirlwind Joe would dance nimbly away and
cover up

Two rounds of this went by and three but Pontas strength though
perceptibly less did not diminish rapidly Joes task was to wear down
that strength not with one blow nor ten but with blow after blow
without end until that enormous strength should be beaten sheer out of
its body There was no rest for the man Joe followed him up step by
step his advancing left foot making an audible tap tap tap on the
hard canvas Then there would come a sudden leap in tigerlike a blow
struck or blows and a swift leap back whereupon the left foot would
take up again its tapping advance When Ponta made his savage rushes
Joe carefully covered up only to emerge his left foot going tap tap
tap as he immediately followed up

Ponta was slowly weakening To the crowd the end was a foregone
conclusion

Oh you Joe it yelled its admiration and affection

Its a shame to take the money it mocked Why dont you eat m
Ponta Go on in an eat m

In the oneminute intermissions Pontas seconds worked over him as they
had not worked before Their calm trust in his tremendous vitality had
been betrayed Genevieve watched their excited efforts while she
listened to the whitefaced second cautioning Joe

Take your time he was saying Youve got m but you got to take
your time Ive seen m fight Hes got a punch to the end of the
count Ive seen m knocked out and clean batty an go on punching just
the same Mickey Sullivan had m goin Puts m to the mat as fast as
he crawls up six times an then leaves an opening Ponta reaches for
his jaw an two minutes afterward Mickeys openin his eyes an askin
whats doin So youve got to watch m No goin in an absorbin one
of them lucky punches now I got money on this fight but I dont call
it mine till hes counted out

Ponta was being doused with water As the gong sounded one of his
seconds inverted a water bottle on his head He started toward the
centre of the ring and the second followed him for several steps
keeping the bottle still inverted The referee shouted at him and he
fled the ring dropping the bottle as he fled It rolled over and over
the water gurgling out upon the canvas till the referee with a quick
flirt of his toe sent the bottle rolling through the ropes

In all the previous rounds Genevieve had not seen Joes fighting face
which had been prefigured to her that morning in the department store
Sometimes his face had been quite boyish other times when taking his
fiercest punishment it had been bleak and gray and still later when
living through and clutching and holding on it had taken on a wistful
expression But now out of danger himself and as he forced the fight
his fighting face came upon him She saw it and shuddered It removed
him so far from her She had thought she knew him all of him and held
him in the hollow of her hand but this she did not knowthis face of
steel this mouth of steel these eyes of steel flashing the light and
glitter of steel It seemed to her the passionless face of an avenging
angel stamped only with the purpose of the Lord

Ponta attempted one of his oldtime rushes but was stopped on the mouth
Implacable insistent ever menacing never letting him rest Joe
followed him up The round the thirteenth closed with a rush in
Pontas corner He attempted a rally was brought to his knees took the
nine seconds count and then tried to clinch into safety only to
receive four of Joes terrible stomach punches so that with the gong he
fell back gasping into the arms of his seconds

Joe ran across the ring to his own corner

Now Im going to get m he said to his second

You sure fixed m that time the latter answered Nothin to stop you
now but a lucky punch Watch out for it

Joe leaned forward feet gathered under him for a spring like a foot
racer waiting the start He was waiting for the gong When it sounded
he shot forward and across the ring catching Ponta in the midst of his
seconds as he rose from his stool And in the midst of his seconds he
went down knocked down by a righthand blow As he arose from the
confusion of buckets stools and seconds Joe put him down again And
yet a third time he went down before he could escape from his own corner

Joe had at last become the whirlwind Genevieve remembered his just
watch youll know when I go after him The house knew it too It was
on its feet every voice raised in a fierce yell It was the bloodcry
of the crowd and it sounded to her like what she imagined must be the
howling of wolves And what with confidence in her lovers victory she
found room in her heart to pity Ponta

In vain he struggled to defend himself to block to cover up to duck
to clinch into a moments safety That moment was denied him Knockdown
after knockdown was his portion He was knocked to the canvas backwards
and sideways was punched in the clinches and in the breakawaysstiff
jolty blows that dazed his brain and drove the strength from his muscles
He was knocked into the corners and out again against the ropes
rebounding and with another blow against the ropes once more He fanned
the air with his arms showering savage blows upon emptiness There was
nothing human left in him He was the beast incarnate roaring and
raging and being destroyed He was smashed down to his knees but
refused to take the count staggering to his feet only to be met stiff
handed on the mouth and sent hurling back against the ropes

In sore travail gasping reeling panting with glazing eyes and sobbing
breath grotesque and heroic fighting to the last striving to get at
his antagonist he surged and was driven about the ring And in that
moment Joes foot slipped on the wet canvas Pontas swimming eyes saw
and knew the chance All the fleeing strength of his body gathered
itself together for the lightning lucky punch Even as Joe slipped the
other smote him fairly on the point of the chin He went over backward
Genevieve saw his muscles relax while he was yet in the air and she
heard the thud of his head on the canvas

The noise of the yelling house died suddenly The referee stooping over
the inert body was counting the seconds Ponta tottered and fell to his
knees He struggled to his feet swaying back and forth as he tried to
sweep the audience with his hatred His legs were trembling and bending
under him he was choking and sobbing fighting to breathe He reeled
backward and saved himself from falling by a blind clutching for the
ropes He clung there drooping and bending and giving in all his body
his head upon his chest until the referee counted the fatal tenth second
and pointed to him in token that he had won

He received no applause and he squirmed through the ropes snakelike
into the arms of his seconds who helped him to the floor and supported
him down the aisle into the crowd Joe remained where he had fallen His
seconds carried him into his corner and placed him on the stool Men
began climbing into the ring curious to see but were roughly shoved out
by the policemen who were already there

Genevieve looked on from her peephole She was not greatly perturbed
Her lover had been knocked out In so far as disappointment was his she
shared it with him but that was all She even felt glad in a way The
Game had played him false and he was more surely hers She had heard of
knockouts from him It often took men some time to recover from the
effects It was not till she heard the seconds asking for the doctor
that she felt really worried

They passed his limp body through the ropes to the stage and it
disappeared beyond the limits of her peephole Then the door of her
dressingroom was thrust open and a number of men came in They were
carrying Joe He was laid down on the dusty floor his head resting on
the knee of one of the seconds No one seemed surprised by her presence
She came over and knelt beside him His eyes were closed his lips
slightly parted His wet hair was plastered in straight locks about his
face She lifted one of his hands It was very heavy and the
lifelessness of it shocked her She looked suddenly at the faces of the
seconds and of the men about her They seemed frightened all save one
and he was cursing in a low voice horribly She looked up and saw
Silverstein standing beside her He too seemed frightened He rested
a kindly hand on her shoulder tightening the fingers with a sympathetic
pressure

This sympathy frightened her She began to feel dazed There was a
bustle as somebody entered the room The person came forward
proclaiming irritably Get out Get out Youve got to clear the
room

A number of men silently obeyed

Who are you he abruptly demanded of Genevieve A girl as Im
alive

Thats all right shes his girl spoke up a young fellow she
recognized as her guide

And you the other man blurted explosively at Silverstein

Im vit her he answered truculently

She works for him explained the young fellow Its all right I tell
you

The newcomer grunted and knelt down He passed a hand over the damp
head grunted again and arose to his feet

This is no case for me he said Send for the ambulance

Then the thing became a dream to Genevieve Maybe she had fainted she
did not know but for what other reason should Silverstein have his arm
around her supporting her All the faces seemed blurred and unreal
Fragments of a discussion came to her ears The young fellow who had
been her guide was saying something about reporters You vill get your
name in der papers she could hear Silverstein saying to her as from a
great distance and she knew she was shaking her head in refusal

There was an eruption of new faces and she saw Joe carried out on a
canvas stretcher Silverstein was buttoning the long overcoat and
drawing the collar about her face She felt the night air on her cheek
and looking up saw the clear cold stars She jammed into a seat
Silverstein was beside her Joe was there too still on his stretcher
with blankets over his naked body and there was a man in blue uniform
who spoke kindly to her though she did not know what he said Horses
hoofs were clattering and she was lurching somewhere through the night

Next light and voices and a smell of iodoform This must be the
receiving hospital she thought this the operating table those the
doctors They were examining Joe One of them a darkeyed
darkbearded foreignlooking man rose up from bending over the table

Never saw anything like it he was saying to another man The whole
back of the skull

Her lips were hot and dry and there was an intolerable ache in her
throat But why didnt she cry She ought to cry she felt it incumbent
upon her There was Lottie there had been another change in the dream
across the little narrow cot from her and she was crying Somebody was
saying something about the coma of death It was not the foreignlooking
doctor but somebody else It did not matter who it was What time was
it As if in answer she saw the faint white light of dawn on the
windows

I was going to be married today she said to Lottie

And from across the cot his sister wailed Dont dont and covering
her face sobbed afresh

This then was the end of it allof the carpets and furniture and the
little rented house of the meetings and walking out the thrilling
nights of starshine the deliciousness of surrender the loving and the
being loved She was stunned by the awful facts of this Game she did not
understandthe grip it laid on mens souls its irony and faithlessness
its risks and hazards and fierce insurgences of the blood making woman
pitiful not the beall and endall of man but his toy and his pastime
to woman his mothering and caretaking his moods and his moments but to
the Game his days and nights of striving the tribute of his head and
hand his most patient toil and wildest effort all the strain and the
stress of his beingto the Game his hearts desire

Silverstein was helping her to her feet She obeyed blindly the daze of
the dream still on her His hand grasped her arm and he was turning her
toward the door

Oh why dont you kiss him Lottie cried out her dark eyes mournful
and passionate

Genevieve stooped obediently over the quiet clay and pressed her lips to
the lips yet warm The door opened and she passed into another room
There stood Mrs Silverstein with angry eyes that snapped vindictively
at sight of her boys clothes

Silverstein looked beseechingly at his spouse but she burst forth
savagely

Vot did I tell you eh Vot did I tell you You vood haf a bruiser for
your steady An now your name vill be in all der papers At a prize
fightvit boys clothes on You liddle strumpet You hussy You

But a flood of tears welled into her eyes and voice and with her fat
arms outstretched ungainly ludicrous holy with motherhood she
tottered over to the quiet girl and folded her to her breast She
muttered gasping inarticulate lovewords rocking slowly to and fro the
while and patting Genevieves shoulder with her ponderous hand
