FINDELKIND


There was a little boy a year or two ago who lived under the shadow of
Martinswand Most people know I should suppose that the Martinswand is
that mountain in the Oberinnthal where several centuries past brave
Kaiser Max lost his footing as he stalked the chamois and fell upon a
ledge of rock and stayed there in mortal peril for thirty hours till
he was rescued by the strength and agility of a Tyrol hunteran angel
in the guise of a hunter as the chronicles of the time prefer to say

The Martinswand is a grand mountain being one of the spurs of the
greater Sonnstein and rises precipitously looming massive and lofty
like a very fortress for giants where it stands right across that
road which if you follow it long enough takes you through Zell to
Landeckold picturesque poetic Landeck where Frederick of the
Empty Pockets rhymed his sorrows in ballads to his peopleand so on by
Bludenz into Switzerland itself by as noble a highway as any traveller
can ever desire to traverse on a summers day It is within a mile
of the little burg of Zell where the people in the time of their
emperors peril came out with torches and bells and the Host lifted
up by their priest and all prayed on their knees underneath the steep
gaunt pile of limestone that is the same today as it was then whilst
Kaiser Max is dust it soars up on one side of this road very steep and
very majestic having bare stone at its base and being all along its
summit crowned with pine woods and on the other side of the road are
a little stone church quaint and low and gray with age and a stone
farmhouse and cattlesheds and timbersheds all of wood that is
darkly brown from time and beyond these are some of the most beautiful
meadows in the world full of tall grass and countless flowers with
pools and little estuaries made by the brimming Inn River that flows
by them and beyond the river are the glaciers of the Sonnstein and the
Selrain and the wild Arlberg region and the golden glow of sunset in
the west most often seen from here through the veil of falling rain

At this farmhouse with Martinswand towering above it and Zell a mile
beyond there lived and lives still a little boy who bears the old
historical name of Findelkind whose father Otto Korner is the last
of a sturdy race of yeomen who had fought with Hofer and Haspinger and
had been free men always

Findelkind came in the middle of seven other children and was a pretty
boy of nine years with slenderer limbs and paler cheeks than his rosy
brethren and tender dreamy eyes that had the look his mother told him
of seeking stars in midday de chercher midi a quatorze heures as the
French have it He was a good little lad and seldom gave any trouble
from disobedience though he often gave it from forgetfulness His
father angrily complained that he was always in the cloudsthat is he
was always dreaming and so very often would spill the milk out of the
pails chop his own fingers instead of the wood and stay watching the
swallows when he was sent to draw water His brothers and sisters were
always making fun of him they were sturdier ruddier and merrier
children than he was loved romping and climbing and nutting thrashing
the walnuttrees and sliding down snowdrifts and got into mischief of
a more common and childish sort than Findelkinds freaks of fancy For
indeed he was a very fanciful little boy everything around had tongues
for him and he would sit for hours among the long rushes on the rivers
edge trying to imagine what the wild greengray water had found in its
wanderings and asking the waterrats and the ducks to tell him about
it but both rats and ducks were too busy to attend to an idle little
boy and never spoke which vexed him

Findelkind however was very fond of his books he would study day and
night in his little ignorant primitive fashion He loved his missal
and his primer and could spell them both out very fairly and was
learning to write of a good priest in Zirl where he trotted three times
a week with his two little brothers When not at school he was chiefly
set to guard the sheep and the cows which occupation left him very much
to himself so that he had many hours in the summertime to stare up to
the skies and wonderwonderwonder about all sorts of things while in
the winterthe long white silent winter when the postwagons ceased
to run and the road into Switzerland was blocked and the whole world
seemed asleep except for the roaring of the windsFindelkind who
still trotted over the snow to school in Zirl would dream still
sitting on the wooden settle by the fire when he came home again under
Martinswand For the worstor the bestof it all was that he was
Findelkind

This is what was always haunting him He was Findelkind and to bear
this name seemed to him to mark him out from all other children and to
dedicate him to heaven One day three years before when he had been
only six years old the priest in Zirl who was a very kindly and
cheerful man and amused the children as much as he taught them had not
allowed Findelkind to leave school to go home because the storm of snow
and wind was so violent but had kept him until the worst should pass
with one or two other little lads who lived some way off and had let
the boys roast a meal of apples and chestnuts by the stove in his little
room and while the wind howled and the blinding snow fell without
had told the children the story of another Findelkindan earlier
Findelkind who had lived in the flesh on Arlberg as far back as 1381
and had been a little shepherd lad just like you said the good man
looking at the little boys munching their roast crabs and whose country
had been over there above Stuben where Danube and Rhine meet and part

The pass of Arlberg is even still so bleak and bitter that few care to
climb there the mountains around are drear and barren and snow lies
till midsummer and even longer sometimes But in the early ages said
the priest and this is quite a true tale that the children heard with
open eyes and mouths only not open because they were full of crabs and
chestnuts in the early ages said the priest to them the Arlberg
was far more dreary than it is now There was only a muletrack over
it and no refuge for man or beast so that wanderers and peddlers and
those whose need for work or desire for battle brought them over that
frightful pass perished in great numbers and were eaten by the bears
and the wolves The little shepherd boy Findelkindwho was a little
boy five hundred years ago remember the priest repeatedwas sorely
disturbed and distressed to see these poor dead souls in the snow winter
after winter and seeing the blanched bones lie on the bare earth
unburied when summer melted the snow It made him unhappy very
unhappy and what could he do he a little boy keeping sheep He had as
his wages two florins a year that was all but his heart rose high and
he had faith in God Little as he was he said to himself he would try
and do something so that year after year those poor lost travellers and
beasts should not perish so He said nothing to anybody but he took the
few florins he had saved up bade his master farewell and went on his
way begginga little fourteenth century boy with long straight hair
and a girdled tunic as you see them continued the priest in the
miniatures in the blackletter missal that lies upon my desk No doubt
heaven favoured him very strongly and the saints watched over him
still without the boldness of his own courage and the faith in his own
heart they would not have done so I suppose too that when knights in
their armour and soldiers in their camps saw such a little fellow all
alone they helped him and perhaps struck some blows for him and
so sped him on his way and protected him from robbers and from wild
beasts Still be sure that the real shield and the real reward that
served Findelkind of Arlberg was the pure and noble purpose that armed
him night and day Now history does not tell us where Findelkind went
nor how he fared nor how long he was about it but history does tell
us that the little barefooted longhaired boy knocking so loudly at
castle gates and city walls in the name of Christ and Christs poor
brethren did so well succeed in his quest that before long he had
returned to his mountain home with means to have a church and a rude
dwelling built where he lived with six other brave and charitable
souls dedicating themselves to St Christopher and going out night
and day to the sound of the Angelus seeking the lost and weary This
is really what Findelkind of Arlberg did five centuries ago and did
so quickly that his fraternity of St Christopher twenty years after
numbered among its members archdukes and prelates and knights without
number and lasted as a great order down to the days of Joseph II This
is what Findelkind in the fourteenth century did I tell you Bear
like faith in your hearts my children and though your generation is
a harder one than this because it is without faith yet you shall move
mountains because Christ and St Christopher will be with you

Then the good man having said that blessed them and left them alone
to their chestnuts and crabs and went into his own oratory to prayer
The other boys laughed and chattered but Findelkind sat very quietly
thinking of his namesake all the day after and for many days and weeks
and months this story haunted him A little boy had done all that
and this little boy had been called Findelkind Findelkind just like
himself

It was beautiful and yet it tortured him If the good man had known
how the history would root itself in the childs mind perhaps he would
never have told it for night and day it vexed Findelkind and yet
seemed beckoning to him and crying Go thou and do likewise

But what could he do

There was the snow indeed and there were the mountains as in the
fourteenth century but there were no travellers lost The diligence did
not go into Switzerland after autumn and the country people who went
by on their mules and in their sledges to Innspruck knew their way very
well and were never likely to be adrift on a winters night or eaten
by a wolf or a bear

When spring came Findelkind sat by the edge of the bright pure water
among the flowering grasses and felt his heart heavy Findelkind of
Arlberg who was in heaven now must look down he fancied and think him
so stupid and so selfish sitting there The first Findelkind a few
centuries before had trotted down on his bare feet from his mountain
pass and taken his little crook and gone out boldly over all the
land on his pilgrimage and knocked at castle gates and city walls
in Christs name and for love of the poor That was to do something
indeed

This poor little living Findelkind would look at the miniatures in the
priests missal in one of which there was the little fourteenthcentury
boy with long hanging hair and a wallet and bare feet and he never
doubted that it was the portrait of the blessed Findelkind who was in
heaven and he wondered if he looked like a little boy there or if he
were changed to the likeness of an angel

He was a boy just like me thought the poor little fellow and he felt
so ashamed of himselfso very ashamed and the priest had told him
to try and do the same He brooded over it so much and it made him so
anxious and so vexed that his brothers ate his porridge and he did
not notice it his sisters pulled his curls and he did not feel it his
father brought a stick down on his back and he only started and stared
and his mother cried because he was losing his mind and would grow
daft and even his mothers tears he scarcely saw He was always
thinking of Findelkind in heaven

When he went for water he spilt onehalf when he did his lessons he
forgot the chief part when he drove out the cow he let her munch the
cabbages and when he was set to watch the oven he let the loaves burn
like great Alfred He was always busied thinking Little Findelkind
that is in heaven did so great a thing why may not I I ought I
ought What was the use of being named after Findelkind that was in
heaven unless one did something great too

Next to the church there is a little stone lodge or shed with two
arched openings and from it you look into the tiny church with its
crucifixes and relics or out to great bold sombre Martinswand as you
like best and in this spot Findelkind would sit hour after hour while
his brothers and sisters were playing and look up at the mountains or
on to the altar and wish and pray and vex his little soul most wofully
and his ewes and his lambs would crop the grass about the entrance and
bleat to make him notice them and lead them farther afield but all in
vain Even his dear sheep he hardly heeded and his pet ewes Katte
and Greta and the big ram Zips rubbed their soft noses in his hand
unnoticed So the summer droned awaythe summer that is so short
in the mountains and yet so green and so radiant with the torrents
tumbling through the flowers and the hay tossing in the meadows and
the lads and lasses climbing to cut the rich sweet grass of the alps
The short summer passed as fast as a dragonfly flashes by all green
and gold in the sun and it was near winter once more and still
Findelkind was always dreaming and wondering what he could do for the
good of St Christopher and the longing to do it all came more and more
into his little heart and he puzzled his brain till his head ached One
autumn morning whilst yet it was dark Findelkind made his mind up and
rose before his brothers and stole downstairs and out into the air
as it was easy to do because the housedoor never was bolted He had
nothing with him he was barefooted and his schoolsatchel was slung
behind him as Findelkind of Arlbergs wallet had been five centuries
before

He took a little staff from the piles of wood lying about and went out
on to the highroad on his way to do heavens will He was not very
sure what that divine will wished but that was because he was only
nine years old and not very wise but Findelkind that was in heaven had
begged for the poor so would he

His parents were very poor but he did not think of them as in any want
at any time because he always had his bowlful of porridge and as much
bread as he wanted to eat This morning he had nothing to eat he wished
to be away before any one could question him

It was quite dusk in the fresh autumn morning The sun had not risen
behind the glaciers of the Stubaithal and the road was scarcely seen
but he knew it very well and he set out bravely saying his prayers to
Christ and to St Christopher and to Findelkind that was in heaven

He was not in any way clear as to what he would do but he thought he
would find some great thing to do somewhere lying like a jewel in the
dust and he went on his way in faith as Findelkind of Arlberg had done
before him

His heart beat high and his head lost its aching pains and his feet
felt light so light as if there were wings to his ankles He would not
go to Zirl because Zirl he knew so well and there could be nothing
very wonderful waiting there and he ran fast the other way When he was
fairly out from under the shadow of Martinswand he slackened his pace
and saw the sun come on his path and the red day redden the graygreen
water and the early Stellwagen from Landeck that had been lumbering
along all the night overtook him

He would have run after it and called out to the travellers for alms
but he felt ashamed His father had never let him beg and he did not
know how to begin

The Stellwagen rolled on through the autumn mud and that was one chance
lost He was sure that the first Findelkind had not felt ashamed when he
had knocked at the first castle gates

By and by when he could not see Martinswand by turning his head back
ever so he came to an inn that used to be a posthouse in the old days
when men travelled only by road A woman was feeding chickens in the
bright clear red of the cold daybreak

Findelkind timidly held out his hand For the poor he murmured and
doffed his cap

The old woman looked at him sharply Oh is it you little Findelkind
Have you run off from school Be off with you home I haves mouths
enough to feed here

Findelkind went away and began to learn that it is not easy to be a
prophet or a hero in ones own country

He trotted a mile farther and met nothing At last he came to some cows
by the wayside and a man tending them

Would you give me something to help make a monastery he said
timidly and once more took off his cap The man gave a great laugh A
fine monk you And who wants more of these lazy drones Not I

Findelkind never answered he remembered the priest had said that the
years he lived in were very hard ones and men in them had no faith

Ere long he came to a big walled house with turrets and grated
casementsvery big it looked to himlike one of the first
Findelkinds own castles His heart beat loud against his side but he
plucked up his courage and knocked as loud as his heart was beating

He knocked and knocked but no answer came The house was empty But he
did not know that he thought it was that the people within were cruel
and he went sadly onward with the road winding before him and on his
right the beautiful impetuous gray river and on his left the green
Mittelgebirge and the mountains that rose behind it By this time the
day was up the sun was glowing on the red of the cranberry shrubs and
the blue of the bilberryboughs he was hungry and thirsty and tired
But he did not give in for that he held on steadily he knew that there
was near somewhere near a great city that the people called Sprugg
and thither he had resolved to go By noontide he had walked eight
miles and came to a green place where men were shooting at targets the
tall thick grass all around them and a little way farther off was
a train of people chanting and bearing crosses and dressed in long
flowing robes

The place was the Hottinger Au and the day was Saturday and the
village was making ready to perform a miracleplay on the morrow

Findelkind ran to the robed singingfolk quite sure that he saw the
people of God Oh take me take me he cried to them do take me
with you to do heavens work

But they pushed him aside for a crazy little boy that spoiled their
rehearsing

It is only for Hotting folk said a lad older than himself Get
out of the way with you Liebchen And the man who carried the cross
knocked him with force on the head by mere accident but Findelkind
thought he had meant it

Were people so much kinder five centuries before he wondered and felt
sad as the manycoloured robes swept on through the grass and the crack
of the rifles sounded sharply through the music of the chanting voices
He went on footsore and sorrowful thinking of the castle doors that
had opened and the city gates that had unclosed at the summons of the
little longhaired boy whose figure was painted on the missal

He had come now to where the houses were much more numerous though
under the shade of great treeslovely old gray houses some of wood
some of stone some with frescoes on them and gold and colour and
mottoes some with deep barred casements and carved portals and
sculptured figures houses of the poorer people now but still memorials
of a grand and gracious time For he had wandered into the quarter
of St Nicholas in this fair mountain city which he like his
countryfolk called Sprugg though the government calls it Innspruck

He got out upon a long gray wooden bridge and looked up and down the
reaches of the river and thought to himself maybe this was not Sprugg
but Jerusalem so beautiful it looked with its domes shining golden in
the sun and the snow of the Soldstein and Branjoch behind them For
little Findelkind had never come so far as this before As he stood on
the bridge so dreaming a hand clutched him and a voice said

A whole kreutzer or you do not pass

Findelkind started and trembled

A kreutzer he had never owned such a treasure in all his life

I have no money he murmured timidly I came to see if I could get
money for the poor

The keeper of the bridge laughed

You are a little beggar you mean Oh very well Then over my bridge
you do not go

But it is the city on the other side

To be sure it is the city but over nobody goes without a kreutzer

I never have such a thing of my own never never said Findelkind
ready to cry

Then you were a little fool to come away from your home wherever that
may be said the man at the bridgehead Well I will let you go for
you look a baby But do not beg that is bad

Findelkind did it

Then Findelkind was a rogue and a vagabond said the taker of tolls

Oh nonono

Oh yesyesyes little saucebox and take that said the man
giving him a box on the ear being angry at contradiction

Findelkinds head drooped and he went slowly over the bridge
forgetting that he ought to have thanked the tolltaker for a free
passage The world seemed to him very difficult How had Findelkind done
when he had come to bridgesand oh how had Findelkind done when he
had been hungry

For this poor little Findelkind was getting very hungry and his stomach
was as empty as was his wallet

A few steps brought him to the Goldenes Dachl

He forgot his hunger and his pain seeing the sun shine on all that
gold and the curious painted galleries under it He thought it was real
solid gold Real gold laid out on a houseroofand the people all so
poor Findelkind began to muse and wonder why everybody did not climb
up there and take a tile off and be rich But perhaps it would be
wicked Perhaps God put the roof there with all that gold to prove
people Findelkind got bewildered

If God did such a thing was it kind

His head seemed to swim and the sunshine went round and round with
him There went by him just then a very venerablelooking old man with
silver hair he was wrapped in a long cloak Findelkind pulled at the
coat gently and the old man looked down

What is it my boy he asked

Findelkind answered I came out to get gold may I take it off that
roof

It is not gold child it is gilding

What is gilding

It is a thing made to look like gold that is all

It is a lie then

The old man smiled Well nobody thinks so If you like to put it so
perhaps it is What do you want gold for you wee thing

To build a monastery and house the poor

The old mans face scowled and grew dark for he was a Lutheran pastor
from Bavaria

Who taught you such trash he said crossly

It is not trash It is faith

And Findelkinds face began to burn and his blue eyes to darken and
moisten There was a little crowd beginning to gather and the crowd was
beginning to laugh There were many soldiers and rifleshooters in the
throng and they jeered and joked and made fun of the old man in
the long cloak who grew angry then with the child You are a little
idolater and a little impudent sinner he said wrathfully and shook
the boy by the shoulder and went away and the throng that had gathered
around had only poor Findelkind left to tease

He was a very poor little boy indeed to look at with his sheepskin
tunic and his bare feet and legs and his wallet that never was to get
filled

Where do you come from and what do you want they asked and he
answered with a sob in his voice

I want to do like Findelkind of Arlberg

And then the crowd laughed not knowing at all what he meant but
laughing just because they did not know as crowds always will do And
only the big dogs that are so very big in this country and are all
loose and free and goodnatured citizens came up to him kindly and
rubbed against him and made friends and at that tears came into his
eyes and his courage rose and he lifted his head

You are cruel people to laugh he said indignantly the dogs are
kinder People did not laugh at Findelkind He was a little boy just
like me no better and no bigger and as poor and yet he had so much
faith and the world then was so good that he left his sheep and
got money enough to build a church and a hospice to Christ and St
Christopher And I want to do the same for the poor Not for myself no
for the poor I am Findelkind too and Findelkind of Arlberg that is in
heaven speaks to me

Then he stopped and a sob rose again in his throat

He is crazy said the people laughing yet a little scared for the
priest at Zirl had said rightly this is not an age of faith At that
moment there sounded coming from the barracks that used to be the
Schloss in the old days of Kaiser Max and Mary of Burgundy the sound
of drums and trumpets and the tramp of marching feet It was one of the
corps of Jagers of Tyrol going down from the avenue to the Rudolfplatz
with their band before them and their pennons streaming It was a
familiar sight but it drew the streetthrongs to it like magic the
age is not fond of dreamers but it is very fond of drums In almost
a moment the old dark arcades and the riverside and the passages near
were all empty except for the women sitting at their stalls of fruit
or cakes or toys They are wonderful old arched arcades like the
cloisters of a cathedral more than anything else and the shops under
them are all homely and simpleshops of leather of furs of clothes
of wooden playthings of sweet and wholesome bread They are very
quaint and kept by poor folks for poor folks but to the dazed eyes of
Findelkind they looked like a forbidden paradise for he was so hungry
and so heartbroken and he had never seen any bigger place than little
Zirl

He stood and looked wistfully but no one offered him anything Close
by was a stall of splendid purple grapes but the old woman that kept it
was busy knitting She only called to him to stand out of her light

You look a poor brat have you a home said another woman who sold
bridles and whips and horses bells and the like

Oh yes I have a homeby Martinswand said Findelkind with a sigh

The woman looked at him sharply Your parents have sent you on an
errand here

No I have run away

Run away Oh you bad boyunless indeedare they cruel to you

No very good

Are you a little rogue then or a thief

You are a bad woman to think such things said Findelkind hotly
knowing himself on how innocent and sacred a quest he was

Bad I Oh ho said the old dame cracking one of her new whips in
the air I should like to make you jump about with this you thankless
little vagabond Be off

Findelkind sighed again his momentary anger passing for he had been
born with a gentle temper and thought himself to blame much more
readily than he thought other people wereas indeed every wise child
does only there are so few childrenor menthat are wise

He turned his head away from the temptation of the bread and fruit
stalls for in truth hunger gnawed him terribly and wandered a little
to the left From where he stood he could see the long beautiful street
of Teresa with its oriels and arches painted windows and gilded signs
and the steep gray dark mountains closing it in at the distance but
the street frightened him it looked so grand and he knew it would
tempt him so he went where he saw the green tops of some high elms and
beeches The trees like the dogs seemed like friends It was the human
creatures that were cruel

At that moment there came out of the barrack gates with great noise
of trumpets and trampling of horses a group of riders in gorgeous
uniforms with sabres and chains glancing and plumes tossing It looked
to Findelkind like a group of knightsthose knights who had helped and
defended his namesake with their steel and their gold in the old days
of the Arlberg quest His heart gave a great leap and he jumped on the
dust for joy and he ran forward and fell on his knees and waved his cap
like a little mad thing and cried out

Oh dear knights oh great soldiers help me Fight for me for the
love of the saints I have come all the way from Martinswand and I am
Findelkind and I am trying to serve St Christopher like Findelkind of
Arlberg

But his little swaying body and pleading hands and shouting voice and
blowing curls frightened the horses one of them swerved and very nearly
settled the woes of Findelkind for ever and aye by a kick The soldier
who rode the horse reined him in with difficulty He was at the head
of the little staff being indeed no less or more than the general
commanding the garrison which in this city is some fifteen thousand
strong An orderly sprang from his saddle and seized the child and
shook him and swore at him Findelkind was frightened but he shut his
eyes and set his teeth and said to himself that the martyrs must have
had very much worse than these things to suffer in their pilgrimage He
had fancied these riders were knights such knights as the priest had
shown him the likeness of in old picturebooks whose mission it had
been to ride through the world succouring the weak and weary and always
defending the right

What are your swords for if you are not knights he cried
desperately struggling in his captors grip and seeing through his
halfclosed lids the sunshine shining on steel scabbards

What does he want asked the officer in command of the garrison whose
staff all this bright and martial array was He was riding out from the
barracks to an inspection on the Rudolfplatz He was a young man and
had little children himself and was half amused half touched to see
the tiny figure of the little dusty boy

I want to build a monastery like Findelkind of Arlberg and to help
the poor said our Findelkind valorously though his heart was beating
like that of a little mouse caught in a trap for the horses were
trampling up the dust around him and the orderlys grip was hard

The officers laughed aloud and indeed he looked a poor little scrap of
a figure very ill able to help even himself

Why do you laugh cried Findelkind losing his terror in his
indignation and inspired with the courage which a great earnestness
always gives You should not laugh If you were true knights you
would not laugh you would fight for me I am little I knowI am very
littlebut he was no bigger than I and see what great things he did
But the soldiers were good in those days they did not laugh and use bad
words

And Findelkind on whose shoulder the orderlys hold was still fast
faced the horses which looked to him as huge as Martinswand and the
swords which he little doubted were to be sheathed in his heart

The officers stared laughed again then whispered together and
Findelkind heard them say the word crazed Findelkind whose quick
little ears were both strained like a mountain leverets understood
that the great men were saying among themselves that it was not safe for
him to be about alone and that it would be kinder to him to catch and
cage himthe general view with which the world regards enthusiasts

He heard he understood he knew that they did not mean to help him
these men with the steel weapons and the huge steeds but that they
meant to shut him up in a prisonhe little freeborn forestfed
Findelkind He wrenched himself out of the soldiers grip as the rabbit
wrenches itself out of the jaws of the trap even at the cost of leaving
a limb behind shot between the horses legs doubled like a hunted
thing and spied a refuge Opposite the avenue of gigantic poplars and
pleasant stretches of grass shaded by other bigger trees there stands
a very famous church famous alike in the annals of history and of
artthe church of the Franciscans that holds the tomb of Kaiser Max
though alas it holds not his ashes as his dying desire was that it
should The church stands here a noble sombre place with the Silver
Chapel of Philippina Wessler adjoining it and in front the fresh cool
avenues that lead to the river and broad watermeadows and the grand
Hall road bordered with the painted stations of the Cross

There were some peasants coming in from the country driving cows
and some burghers in their carts with fat slow horses some little
children were at play under the poplars and the elms great dogs were
lying about on the grass everything was happy and at peace except the
poor throbbing heart of little Findelkind who thought the soldiers were
coming after him to lock him up as mad and ran and ran as fast as his
trembling legs would carry him making for sanctuary as in the old
bygone days that he loved many a soul less innocent than his had done
The wide doors of the Hofkirche stood open and on the steps lay a
blackandtan hound watching no doubt for its master or mistress who
had gone within to pray Findelkind in his terror vaulted over the
dog and into the church tumbled headlong

It seemed quite dark after the brilliant sunshine on the river and the
grass his forehead touched the stone floor as he fell and as he raised
himself and stumbled forward reverent and bareheaded looking for
the altar to cling to when the soldiers should enter to seize him his
uplifted eyes fell on the great tomb

The tomb seems entirely to fill the church as with its twentyfour
guardian figures around it it towers up in the twilight that reigns
here even at midday There are a stern majesty and grandeur in it which
dwarf every other monument and mausoleum It is grim it is rude it
is savage with the spirit of the rough ages that created it but it
is great with their greatness it is heroic with their heroism it is
simple with their simplicity

As the awestricken eyes of the terrified child fell on the mass of stone
and bronze the sight smote him breathless The mailed warriors standing
around it so motionless so solemn filled him with a frozen nameless
fear He had never a doubt that they were the dead arisen The foremost
that met his eyes were Theodoric and Arthur the next grim Rudolf
father of a dynasty of emperors There leaning on their swords the
three gazed down on him armoured armed majestic serious guarding
the empty grave which to the child who knew nothing of its history
seemed a bier and at the feet of Theodoric who alone of them all
looked young and merciful poor little desperate Findelkind fell with a
piteous sob and cried I am not mad Indeed indeed I am not mad

He did not know that these grand figures were but statues of bronze
He was quite sure they were the dead arisen and meeting there around
that tomb on which the solitary kneeling knight watched and prayed
encircled as by a wall of steel by these his comrades He was not
frightened he was rather comforted and stilled as with a sudden sense
of some deep calm and certain help

Findelkind without knowing that he was like so many dissatisfied poets
and artists much bigger than himself dimly felt in his little tired
mind how beautiful and how gorgeous and how grand the world must
have been when heroes and knights like these had gone by in its daily
sunshine and its twilight storms No wonder Findelkind of Arlberg had
found his pilgrimage so fair when if he had needed any help he had
only had to kneel and clasp these firm mailed limbs these strong
crosshilted swords in the name of Christ and of the poor

Theodoric seemed to look down on him with benignant eyes from under the
raised visor and our poor Findelkind weeping threw his small arms
closer and closer around the bronze knees of the heroic figure and
sobbed aloud Help me help me Oh turn the hearts of the people to
me and help me to do good

But Theodoric answered nothing

There was no sound in the dark hushed church the gloom grew darker
over Findelkinds eyes the mighty forms of monarchs and of heroes grew
dim before his sight He lost consciousness and fell prone upon the
stones at Theodorics feet for he had fainted from hunger and emotion

When he awoke it was quite evening there was a lantern held over his
head voices were muttering curiously and angrily bending over him were
two priests a sacristan of the church and his own father His little
wallet lay by him on the stones always empty

Boy of mine were you mad cried his father half in rage half in
tenderness The chase you have led meand your mother thinking you
were drownedand all the working day lost running after old womens
tales of where they had seen you Oh little fool little fool What was
amiss with Martinswand that you must leave it

Findelkind slowly and feebly rose and sat up on the pavement and
looked up not at his father but at the knight Theodoric

I thought they would help me to keep the poor he muttered feebly as
he glanced at his own wallet And it is emptyempty

And are we not poor enough cried his father with natural impatience
ready to tear his hair with vexation at having such a little idiot for
a son Must you rove afield to find poverty to help when it sits cold
enough the Lord knows at our own hearth Oh little ass little dolt
little maniac fit only for a madhouse talking to iron figures and
taking them for real men What have I done O heaven that I should be
afflicted thus

And the poor man wept being a good affectionate soul but not very
wise and believing that his boy was mad Then seized with sudden rage
once more at thought of his day all wasted and its hours harassed and
miserable through searching for the lost child he plucked up the light
slight figure of Findelkind in his own arms and with muttered thanks
and excuses to the sacristan of the church bore the boy out with him
into the evening air and lifted him into a cart which stood there with
a horse harnessed to one side of the pole as the countrypeople love
to do to the risk of their own lives and their neighbours Findelkind
said never a word he was as dumb as Theodoric had been to him he felt
stupid heavy half blind his father pushed him some bread and he ate
it by sheer instinct as a lost animal will do the cart jogged on the
stars shone the great church vanished in the gloom of night

As they went through the city toward the riverside along the homeward
way never a word did his father who was a silent man at all times
address to him Only once as they jogged over the bridge he spoke

Son he asked did you run away truly thinking to please God and help
the poor

Truly I did answered Findelkind with a sob in his throat

Then thou wert an ass said his father Didst never think of thy
mothers love and of my toil Look at home

Findelkind was mute The drive was very long backward by the same way
with the river shining in the moonlight and the mountains half covered
with the clouds

It was ten by the bells of Zirl when they came once more under the
solemn shadow of grave Martinswand There were lights moving about his
house his brothers and sisters were still up his mother ran out into
the road weeping and laughing with fear and joy

Findelkind himself said nothing

He hung his head

They were too fond of him to scold him or to jeer at him they made him
go quickly to his bed and his mother made him a warm milk posset and
kissed him

We will punish thee tomorrow naughty and cruel one said his parent
But thou art punished enough already for in thy place little Stefan
had the sheep and he has lost Kattes lambsthe beautiful twin lambs
I dare not tell thy father tonight Dost hear the poor thing mourn Do
not go afield for thy duty again

A pang went through the heart of Findelkind as if a knife had pierced
it He loved Katte better than almost any other living thing and
she was bleating under his window childless and alone They were such
beautiful lambs toolambs that his father had promised should never
be killed but be reared to swell the flock

Findelkind cowered down in his bed and felt wretched beyond all
wretchedness He had been brought back his wallet was empty and
Kattes lambs were lost He could not sleep

His pulses were beating like so many steamhammers he felt as if his
body were all one great throbbing heart His brothers who lay in the
same chamber with him were sound asleep very soon his father and
mother snored also on the other side of the wall Findelkind was alone
wide awake watching the big white moon sail past his little casement
and hearing Katte bleat

Where were her poor twin lambs

The night was bitterly cold for it was already far on in autumn the
rivers had swollen and flooded many fields the snow for the last week
had fallen quite low down on the mountainsides

Even if still living the little lambs would die out on such a night
without the mother or food and shelter of any sort Findelkind whose
vivid brain always saw everything that he imagined as if it were being
acted before his eyes in fancy saw his two dear lambs floating dead
down the swollen tide entangled in rushes on the flooded shore or
fallen with broken limbs upon a crest of rocks He saw them so plainly
that scarcely could he hold back his breath from screaming aloud in the
still night and answering the mourning wail of the desolate mother

At last he could bear it no longer his head burned and his
brain seemed whirling round at a bound he leaped out of bed quite
noiselessly slid into his sheepskins and stole out as he had done the
night before hardly knowing what he did Poor Katte was mourning in
the wooden shed with the other sheep and the wail of her sorrow sounded
sadly across the loud roar of the rushing river

The moon was still high

Above against the sky black and awful with clouds floating over its
summit was the great Martinswand

Findelkind this time called the big dog Waldmar to him and with the
dog beside him went once more out into the cold and the gloom whilst
his father and mother his brothers and sisters wore sleeping and poor
childless Katte alone was awake

He looked up at the mountain and then across the waterswept meadows to
the river He was in doubt which way to take Then he thought that in
all likelihood the lambs would have been seen if they had wandered the
river way and even little Stefan would have had too much sense to let
them go there So he crossed the road and began to climb Martinswand

With the instinct of the born mountaineer he had brought out his
crampons with him and had now fastened them on his feet he knew every
part and ridge of the mountains and had more than once climbed over to
that very spot where Kaiser Max had hung in peril of his life

On second thoughts he bade Waldmar go back to the house The dog was a
clever mountaineer too but Findelkind did not wish to lead him into
danger I have done the wrong and I will bear the brunt he said
to himself for he felt as if he had killed Kattes children and the
weight of the sin was like lead on his heart and he would not kill good
Waldmar too

His little lantern did not show much light and as he went higher
upwards he lost sight of the moon The cold was nothing to him because
the clear still air was that in which he had been reared and the
darkness he did not mind because he was used to that also but the
weight of sorrow upon him he scarcely knew how to bear and how to
find two tiny lambs in this vast waste of silence and shadow would
have puzzled and wearied older minds than his Garibaldi and all his
household old soldiers tried and true sought all night once upon
Caprera in such a quest in vain

If he could only have awakened his brother Stefan to ask him which way
they had gone but then to be sure he remembered Stefan must have
told that to all those who had been looking for the lambs from sunset to
nightfall All alone he began the ascent

Time and again in the glad springtime and the fresh summer weather he
had driven his flock upwards to eat the grass that grew in the clefts
of the rocks and on the broad green alps The sheep could not climb to
the highest points but the goats did and he with them Time and again
he had lain on his back in these uppermost heights with the lower
clouds behind him and the black wings of the birds and the crows almost
touching his forehead as he lay gazing up into the blue depth of the
sky and dreaming dreaming dreaming

He would never dream any more now he thought to himself His dreams had
cost Katte her lambs and the world of the dead Findelkind was gone for
ever gone were all the heroes and knights gone all the faith and the
force gone every one who cared for the dear Christ and the poor in
pain

The bells of Zirl were ringing midnight Findelkind heard and wondered
that only two hours had gone by since his mother had kissed him in his
bed It seemed to him as if long long nights had rolled away and he
had lived a hundred years

He did not feel any fear of the dark calm night lit now and then by
silvery gleams of moon and stars The mountain was his old familiar
friend and the ways of it had no more terror for him than these hills
here used to have for the bold heart of Kaiser Max Indeed all he
thought of was KatteKatte and the lambs He knew the way that the
sheeptracks ran the sheep could not climb so high as the goats and he
knew too that little Stefan could not climb so high as he So he began
his search low down upon Martinswand

After midnight the cold increased there were snowclouds hanging near
and they opened over his head and the soft snow came flying along For
himself he did not mind it but alas for the lambsif it covered them
how would he find them And if they slept in it they were dead

It was bleak and bare on the mountainside though there were still
patches of grass such as the flocks liked that had grown since the hay
was cut The frost of the night made the stone slippery and even the
irons gripped it with difficulty and there was a strong wind rising
like a giants breath and blowing his small horn lantern to and fro

Now and then he quaked a little with fearnot fear of the night or the
mountains but of strange spirits and dwarfs and goblins of ill repute
said to haunt Martinswand after nightfall Old women had told him of
such things though the priest always said that they were only foolish
tales there being nothing on Gods earth wicked save men and women who
had not clean hearts and hands Findelkind believed the priest still
all alone on the side of the mountain with the snowflakes flying around
him he felt a nervous thrill that made him tremble and almost turn
backward Almost but not quite for he thought of Katte and the poor
little lambs lostand perhaps deadthrough his fault

The path went zigzag and was very steep the Arolla pines swayed their
boughs in his face stones that lay in his path unseen in the gloom
made him stumble Now and then a large bird of the night flew by with a
rushing sound the air grew so cold that all Martinswand might have
been turning to one huge glacier All at once he heard through the
stillnessfor there is nothing so still as a mountainside in snowa
little pitiful bleat All his terrors vanished all his memories of
ghosttales passed away his heart gave a leap of joy he was sure it
was the cry of the lambs He stopped to listen more surely He was now
many score of feet above the level of his home and of Zirl he was as
nearly as he could judge halfway as high as where the cross in the
cavern marks the spot of the Kaisers peril The little bleat sounded
above him very feeble and faint

Findelkind set his lantern down braced himself up by drawing tighter
his old leathern girdle set his sheepskin cap firm on his forehead and
went toward the sound as far as he could judge that it might be He was
out of the woods now there were only a few straggling pines rooted here
and there in a mass of looselying rock and slate so much he could tell
by the light of the lantern and the lambs by the bleating seemed still
above him

It does not perhaps seem very hard labour to hunt about by a dusky
light upon a desolate mountainside but when the snow is falling
fastwhen the light is only a small circle wavering yellowish on
the whitewhen around is a wilderness of loose stones and yawning
cleftswhen the air is ice and the hour is past midnightthe task
is not a light one for a man and Findelkind was a child like that
Findelkind that was in heaven

Long very long was his search he grew hot and forgot all fear except a
spasm of terror lest his light should burn low and die out The bleating
had quite ceased now and there was not even a sigh to guide him but he
knew that near him the lambs must be and he did not waver or despair

He did not pray praying in the morning had been no use but he trusted
in God and he laboured hard toiling to and fro seeking in every nook
and behind each stone and straining every muscle and nerve till the
sweat rolled in a briny dew off his forehead and his curls dripped with
wet At last with a scream of joy he touched some soft close wool that
gleamed white as the white snow He knelt down on the ground and peered
behind the stone by the full light of his lantern there lay the little
lambstwo little brothers twin brothers huddled close together
asleep Asleep He was sure they were asleep for they were so silent
and still

He bowed over them and kissed them and laughed and cried and kissed
them again Then a sudden horror smote him they were so very still
There they lay cuddled close one on another one little white head on
each little white bodydrawn closer than ever together to try and get
warm

He called to them he touched them then he caught them up in his arms
and kissed them again and again and again Alas they were frozen and
dead Never again would they leap in the long green grass and frisk
with each other and lie happy by Kattes side they had died calling
for their mother and in the long cold cruel night only death had
answered

Findelkind did not weep or scream or tremble his heart seemed frozen
like the dead lambs

It was he who had killed them

He rose up and gathered them in his arms and cuddled them in the skirts
of his sheepskin tunic and cast his staff away that he might carry
them and so with their weight set his face to the snow and the wind
once more and began his downward way

Once a great sob shook him that was all Now he had no fear

The night might have been noonday the snowstorm might have been
summer for aught that he knew or cared

Long and weary was the way and often he stumbled and had to rest often
the terrible sleep of the snow lay heavy on his eyelids and he longed
to lie down and be at rest as the little brothers were often it seemed
to him that he would never reach home again But he shook the lethargy
off him and resisted the longing and held on his way he knew that his
mother would mourn for him as Katte mourned for the lambs At length
through all difficulty and danger when his light had spent itself and
his strength had wellnigh spent itself too his feet touched the old
highroad There were flickering torches and many people and loud cries
around the church as there had been four hundred years before when the
last sacrament had been said in the valley for the hunterking in peril
above

His mother being sleepless and anxious had risen long before it was
dawn and had gone to the childrens chamber and had found the bed of
Findelkind empty once more

He came into the midst of the people with the two little lambs in his
arms and he heeded neither the outcries of neighbours nor the frenzied
joy of his mother his eyes looked straight before him and his face was
white like the snow

I killed them he said and then two great tears rolled down his
cheeks and fell on the little cold bodies of the two little dead
brothers

Findelkind was very ill for many nights and many days after that

Whenever he spoke in his fever he always said I killed them

Never anything else

So the dreary winter months went by while the deep snow filled up lands
and meadows and covered the great mountains from summit to base and
all around Martinswand was quite still and now and then the post went
by to Zirl and on the holydays the bells tolled that was all His
mother sat between the stove and his bed with a sore heart and his
father as he went to and fro between the walls of beaten snow from the
woodshed to the cattlebyre was sorrowful thinking to himself the
child would die and join that earlier Findelkind whose home was with
the saints

But the child did not die

He lay weak and wasted and almost motionless a long time but slowly as
the springtime drew near and the snows on the lower hills loosened and
the abounding waters coursed green and crystal clear down all the sides
of the hills Findelkind revived as the earth did and by the time the
new grass was springing and the first blue of the gentian gleamed on
the alps he was well

But to this day he seldom plays and scarcely ever laughs His face is
sad and his eyes have a look of trouble

Sometimes the priest of Zirl says of him to others He will be a great
poet or a great hero some day Who knows

Meanwhile in the heart of the child there remains always a weary pain
that lies on his childish life as a stone may lie on a flower

I killed them he says often to himself thinking of the two little
white brothers frozen to death on Martinswand that cruel night and
he does the things that are told him and is obedient and tries to be
content with the humble daily duties that are his lot and when he says
his prayers at bedtime always ends them so

Dear God do let the little lambs play with the other Findelkind that
is in heaven

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
