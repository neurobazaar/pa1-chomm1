IN THE SHADOW OF THE GLEN

A PLAY IN ONE ACT


SCENEThe last cottage at the head of a long glen in County Wicklow

Cottage kitchen turf fire on the right a bed near it against the wall
with a body lying on it covered with a sheet A door is at the other
end of the room with a low table near it and stools or wooden chairs
There are a couple of glasses on the table and a bottle of whisky as
if for a wake with two cups a teapot and a homemade cake There is
another small door near the bed Nora Burke is moving about the room
settling a few things and lighting candles on the table looking now
and then at the bed with an uneasy look Some one knocks softly at the
door She takes up a stocking with money from the table and puts it in
her pocket Then she opens the door

TRAMP Outside Good evening to you lady of the house

NORA

Good evening kindly stranger its a wild night God help you to be
out in the rain falling

TRAMP It is surely and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair

NORA Is it walking on your feet stranger

TRAMP On my two feet lady of the house and when I saw the light below
I thought maybe if youd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner
where a man could sleep he looks in past her and sees the dead man
The Lord have mercy on us all

NORA It doesnt matter anyway stranger come in out of the rain

TRAMP Coming in slowly and going towards the bed Is it departed he
is

NORA It is stranger Hes after dying on me God forgive him and there
I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills and no turf drawn for
the winter

TRAMP Looking closely at the dead man Its a queer look is on him for
a man thats dead

NORA Halfhumorously He was always queer stranger and I suppose
them thats queer and they living men will be queer bodies after

TRAMP Isnt it a great wonder youre letting him lie there and he is
not tidied or laid out itself

NORA Coming to the bed I was afeard stranger for he put a black
curse on me this morning if Ild touch his body the time held die
sudden or let any one touch it except his sister only and its ten
miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill

TRAMP Looking at her and nodding slowly Its a queer story he
wouldnt let his own wife touch him and he dying quiet in his bed

NORA He was an old man and an odd man stranger and its always up on
the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist She pulls back a
bit of the sheet Lay your hand on him now and tell me if its cold he
is surely

TRAMP Is it getting the curse on me yould be woman of the house I
wouldnt lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with
gold

NORA Looking uneasily at the body Maybe cold would be no sign of
death with the like of him for he was always cold every day since I
knew himand every night strangershe covers up his face and comes
away from the bed but Im thinking its dead he is surely for hes
complaining a while back of a pain in his heart and this morning the
time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four he was taken
with a sharp turn Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was
destroyed he was the time the shadow was going up through the glen and
when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep and let a great
cry out of him and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep

TRAMP Crosses himself God rest his soul

NORA Pouring him out a glass of whisky Maybe that would do you better
than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow

TRAMP The Almighty God reward you and may it be to your good health
He drinks

NORA Giving him a pipe and tobacco Ive no pipes saving his own
stranger but theyre sweet pipes to smoke

TRAMP Thank you kindly lady of the house

NORA Sit down now stranger and be taking your rest

TRAMP Filling a pipe and looking about the room Ive walked a great
way through the world lady of the house and seen great wonders but I
never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits and good tobacco and
the best of pipes and no one to taste them but a woman only

NORA Didnt you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when
the sun went down and how would I go out into the glen and tell the
neighbours and I a lone woman with no house near me

TRAMP Drinking Theres no offence lady of the house

NORA No offence in life stranger How would the like of you passing
in the dark night know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at
all

TRAMP Sitting down I knew rightly He lights his pipe so that there
is a sharp light beneath his haggard face And I was thinking and I
coming in through the door that its many a lone woman would be afeard
of the like of me in the dark night in a place wouldnt be so lonesome
as this place where there arent two living souls would see the little
light you have shining from the glass

NORA Slowly Im thinking many would be afeard but I never knew what
way Id be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all She
looks towards the window and lowers her voice Its other things than
the like of you stranger would make a person afeard

TRAMP Looking round with a halfshudder It is surely God help us
all

NORA Looking at him for a moment with curiosity Youre saying that
stranger as if you were easy afeard

TRAMP Speaking mournfully Is it myself lady of the house that does
be walking round in the long nights and crossing the hills when the fog
is on them the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm and
a rabbit as big as a bay horse and a stack of turf as big as a towering
church in the city of Dublin If myself was easily afeard Im telling
you its long ago Ild have been locked into the Richmond Asylum or
maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old
shirt and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcythe Lord have
mercy on himin the year thats gone

NORA With interest You knew Darcy

TRAMP Wasnt I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world

NORA There were great stories of what was heard at that time but would
any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen

TRAMP It was no lie lady of the house I was passing below on a dark
night the like of this night and the sheep were lying under the ditch
and every one of them coughing and choking like an old man with the
great rain and the fog Then I heard a thing talkingqueer talk you
wouldnt believe at all and you out of your dreamsand Merciful
God says I if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the
thick mist Im destroyed surely Then I run and I run and I run
till I was below in Rathvanna I got drunk that night I got drunk
in the morning and drunk the day afterI was coming from the races
beyondand the third day they found Darcy Then I knew it was
himself I was after hearing and I wasnt afeard any more

NORA Speaking sorrowfully and slowly God spare Darcy held always
look in here and he passing up or passing down and its very lonesome
I was after him a long while she looks over at the bed and lowers her
voice speaking very clearly and then I got happy againif its ever
happy we are strangerfor I got used to being lonesome A short
pause then she stands up

NORA Was there any one on the last bit of the road stranger and you
coming from Aughrim

TRAMP There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes and he
running after them this way and that

NORA With a halfsmile Far down stranger

TRAMP A piece only

She fills the kettle and puts it on the fire

NORA Maybe if youre not easy afeard yould stay here a short while
alone with himself

TRAMP I would surely A man thats dead can do no hurt

NORA Speaking with a sort of constraint Im going a little back to
the west stranger for himself would go there one night and another
and whistle at that place and then the young man youre after
seeinga kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage
beyondwould walk round to see if there was a thing weld have to be
done and Im wanting him this night the way he can go down into the
glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead

TRAMP Looking at the body in the sheet Its myself will go for him
lady of the house and let you not be destroying yourself with the great
rain

NORA You wouldnt find your way stranger for theres a small path
only and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would
be drowned She puts a shawl over her head Let you be making yourself
easy and saying a prayer for his soul and its not long Ill be coming
again

TRAMP Moving uneasily Maybe if youd a piece of a grey thread and a
sharp needletheres great safety in a needle lady of the houseIld
be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat the time Ill
be praying for his soul and it going up naked to the saints of God

NORA Takes a needle and thread from the front of her dress and gives
it to him Theres the needle stranger and Im thinking you wont be
lonesome and you used to the back hills for isnt a dead man itself
more company than to be sitting alone and hearing the winds crying and
you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay

TRAMP Slowly Its true surely and the Lord have mercy on us all

Nora goes out The Tramp begins stitching one of the tags in his coat
saying the De Profundis under his breath In an instant the sheet is
drawn slowly down and Dan Burke looks out The Tramp moves uneasily
then looks up and springs to his feet with a movement of terror

DAN With a hoarse voice Dont be afeard stranger a man thats dead
can do no hurt

TRAMP Trembling I meant no harm your honour and wont you leave me
easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul

A long whistle is heard outside

DAN Sitting up in his bed and speaking fiercely Ah the devil mend
her Do you hear that stranger Did ever you hear another woman
could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth He looks
at the table hurriedly Im destroyed with the drouth and let you
bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back

TRAMP Doubtfully Is it not dead you are

DAN How would I be dead and I as dry as a baked bone stranger

TRAMP Pouring out the whisky What will herself say if she smells the
stuff on you for Im thinking its not for nothing youre letting on to
be dead

DAN It is not stranger but she wont be coming near me at all and
its not long now Ill be letting on for Ive a cramp in my back and
my hips asleep on me and theres been the devils own fly itching my
nose Its near dead I was wanting to sneeze and you blathering about
the rain and Darcy bitterlythe devil choke himand the towering
church Crying out impatiently Give me that whisky Would you have
herself come back before I taste a drop at all

Tramp gives him the glass

DAN After drinking Go over now to that cupboard and bring me a black
stick youll see in the west corner by the wall

TRAMP Taking a stick from the cupboard Is it that

DAN It is stranger its a long time Im keeping that stick for Ive a
bad wife in the house

TRAMP With a queer look Is it herself master of the house and she a
grand woman to talk

DAN Its herself surely its a bad wife she isa bad wife for an old
man and Im getting old God help me though Ive an arm to me still
He takes the stick in his hand Let you wait now a short while and
its a great sight youll see in this room in two hours or three He
stops to listen Is that somebody above

TRAMP Listening Theres a voice speaking on the path

DAN Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was
lying He covers himself up hastily Be falling to sleep now and dont
let on you know anything or Ill be having your life I wouldnt have
told you at all but its destroyed with the drouth I was

TRAMP Covering his head Have no fear master of the house What is it
I know of the like of you that Ild be saying a word or putting out my
hand to stay you at all

He goes back to the fire sits down on a stool with his back to the bed
and goes on stitching his coat

DAN Under the sheet querulously Stranger

TRAMP Quickly Whisht whisht Be quiet Im telling you theyre
coming now at the door

Nora comes in with Micheal Dara a tall innocent young man behind
her

NORA I wasnt long at all stranger for I met himself on the path

TRAMP You were middling long lady of the house

NORA There was no sign from himself

TRAMP No sign at all lady of the house

NORA To Micheal Go over now and pull down the sheet and look on
himself Micheal Dara and youll see its the truth Im telling you

MICHEAL I will not Nora I do be afeard of the dead

He sits down on a stool next the table facing the tramp Nora puts the
kettle on a lower hook of the pot hooks and piles turf under it

NORA Turning to Tramp Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the
young man stranger or speaking more persuasively will you go into
the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed Im
thinking its destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the
great rain

TRAMP Is it to go away and leave you and you having a wake lady of the
house I will not surely He takes a drink from his glass which he has
beside him And its none of your tea Im asking either

He goes on stitching Nora makes the tea

MICHEAL After looking at the tramp rather scornfully for a moment
Thats a poor coat you have God help you and Im thinking its a poor
tailor you are with it

TRAMP If its a poor tailor I am Im thinking its a poor herd does be
running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen
yourself running this day young fellow and you coming from the fair

Nora comes back to the table

NORA To Micheal in a low voice Let you not mind him at all Micheal
Dara he has a drop taken and its soon hell be falling asleep

MICHEAL Its no lie hes telling I was destroyed surely They were that
wilful they were running off into one mans bit of oats and another
mans bit of hay and tumbling into the red bogs till its more like a
pack of old goats than sheep they were Mountain ewes is a queer breed
Nora Burke and Im not used to them at all

NORA Settling the tea things Theres no one can drive a mountain ewe
but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure Ive heard them say and
above by Rathvanna and the Glen Imaal men the like of Patch Darcy God
spare his soul who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one
of them and he not reckoning them at all

MICHEAL Uneasily Is it the man went queer in his head the year thats
gone

NORA It is surely

TRAMP Plaintively That was a great man young fellow a great man Im
telling you There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldnt know
before it was marked and held run from this to the city of Dublin and
never catch for his breath

NORA Turning round quickly He was a great man surely stranger and
isnt it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of
a dead man and he mad dying

TRAMP Its the truth Im saying God spare his soul

He puts the needle under the collar of his coat and settles himself
to sleep in the chimneycorner Nora sits down at the table their backs
are turned to the bed

MICHEAL Looking at her with a queer look I heard tell this day Nora
Burke that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and
passing down and I heard them say held never past it night or morning
without speaking with yourself

NORA In a low voice It was no lie you heard Micheal Dara

MICHEAL Im thinking its a power of men youre after knowing if its in
a lonesome place you live itself

NORA Giving him his tea Its in a lonesome place you do have to be
talking with some one and looking for some one in the evening of the
day and if its a power of men Im after knowing they were fine men
for I was a hard child to please and a hard girl to please she looks
at him a little sternly and its a hard woman I am to please this day
Micheal Dara and its no lie Im telling you

MICHEAL Looking over to see that the tramp is asleep and then pointing
to the dead man Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took
himself for your man

NORA What way would I live and I an old woman if I didnt marry a man
with a bit of a farm and cows on it and sheep on the back hills

MICHEAL Considering Thats true Nora and maybe its no fool you
were for theres good grazing on it if it is a lonesome place and Im
thinking its a good sum hes left behind 28

NORA Taking the stocking with money from her pocket and putting it on
the table I do be thinking in the long nights it was a big fool I was
that time Micheal Dara for what good is a bit of a farm with cows on
it and sheep on the back hills when you do be sitting looking out from
a door the like of that door and seeing nothing but the mists rolling
down the bog and the mists again and they rolling up the bog and
hearing nothing but the wind crying out in the bits of broken trees were
left from the great storm and the streams roaring with the rain

MICHEAL Looking at her uneasily What is it ails you this night Nora
Burke Ive heard tell its the like of that talk you do hear from men
and they after being a great while on the back hills

NORA Putting out the money on the table Its a bad night and a wild
night Micheal Dara and isnt it a great while I am at the foot of the
back hills sitting up here boiling food for himself and food for the
brood sow and baking a cake when the night falls She puts up the
money listlessly in little piles on the table Isnt it a long while
I am sitting here in the winter and the summer and the fine spring
with the young growing behind me and the old passing saying to myself
one time to look on Mary Brien who wasnt that height holding out
her hand and I a fine girl growing up and there she is now with
two children and another coming on her in three months or four She
pauses

MICHEAL Moving over three of the piles Thats three pounds we have
now Nora Burke

NORA Continuing in the same voice And saying to myself another time
to look on Peggy Cavanagh who had the lightest hand at milking a cow
that wouldnt be easy or turning a cake and there she is now walking
round on the roads or sitting in a dirty old house with no teeth in
her mouth and no sense and no more hair than yould see on a bit of a
hill and they after burning the furze from it

MICHEAL Thats five pounds and ten notes a good sum surely Its
not that way youll be talking when you marry a young man Nora Burke
and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs and I got
a grand price for Im no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are
good

NORA What was it you got

MICHEAL Twenty pound for the lot Nora Burke Weld do right to wait
now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches and then
youll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna and Ill bring the sheep up
on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain and we wont have
anything weld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down

NORA Pouring him out some whisky Why would I marry you Mike Dara
Youll be getting old and Ill be getting old and in a little while
Im telling you youll be sitting up in your bedthe way himself was
sittingwith a shake in your face and your teeth falling and the
white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be
leaping a gap

Dan Burke sits up noiselessly from under the sheet with his hand to
his face His white hair is sticking out round his head

NORA Goes on slowly without hearing him Its a pitiful thing to be
getting old but its a queer thing surely Its a queer thing to see
an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him and a rough
word in his mouth and his chin the way it would take the bark from the
edge of an oak board yould have building a door God forgive me
Micheal Dara well all be getting old but its a queer thing surely

MICHEAL Its too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old
man Nora and youre talking again like a herd that would be coming
down from the thick mist he puts his arm round her but its a fine
life youll have now with a young man a fine life surely

Dan sneezes violently Micheal tries to get to the door but before
he can do so Dan jumps out of the bed in queer white clothes with his
stick in his hand and goes over and puts his back against it

MICHEAL Son of God deliver us

Crosses himself and goes backward across the room

DAN Holding up his hand at him Now youll not marry her the time Im
rotting below in the Seven Churches and youll see the thing Ill give
you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high

MICHEAL To Nora Get me out of it Nora for the love of God He
always did what you bid him and Im thinking he would do it now

NORA Looking at the Tramp Is it dead he is or living

DAN Turning towards her Its little you care if its dead or living I
am but therell be an end now of your fine times and all the talk you
have of young men and old men and of the mist coming up or going down
He opens the door Youll walk out now from that door Nora Burke
and its not tomorrow or the next day or any day of your life that
youll put in your foot through it again

TRAMP Standing up Its a hard thing youre saying for an old man
master of the house and what would the like of her do if you put her
out on the roads

DAN Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below and be begging
money at the crossroad or selling songs to the men To Nora Walk
out now Nora Burke and its soon youll be getting old with that life
Im telling you its soon your teethll be falling and your headll be
the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap

He pauses she looks round at Micheal

MICHEAL Timidly Theres a fine Union below in Rathdrum

DAN The like of her would never go there Its lonesome roads shell
be going and hiding herself away till the end will come and they
find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her or the big
spiders maybe and they putting their webs on her in the butt of a
ditch

NORA Angrily What way will yourself be that day Daniel Burke What
way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave
For its bad you are living and its bad youll be when youre dead
She looks at him a moment fiercely then half turns away and speaks
plaintively again Yet if it is itself Daniel Burke who can help it
at all and let you be getting up into your bed and not be taking your
death with the wind blowing on you and the rain with it and you half
in your skin

DAN Its proud and happy yould be if I was getting my death the day I
was shut of yourself Pointing to the door Let you walk out through
that door Im telling you and let you not be passing this way if its
hungry you are or wanting a bed

TRAMP Pointing to Micheal Maybe himself would take her

NORA What would he do with me now

TRAMP Give you the half of a dry bed and good food in your mouth

DAN Is it a fool you think him stranger or is it a fool you were born
yourself Let her walk out of that door and let you go along with
her strangerif its raining itselffor its too much talk you have
surely

TRAMP Going over to Nora Well be going now lady of the housethe
rain is falling but the air is kind and maybe itll be a grand morning
by the grace of God

NORA What good is a grand morning when Im destroyed surely and I going
out to get my death walking the roads

TRAMP Youll not be getting your death with myself lady of the house
and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth Well be
going now Im telling you and the time youll be feeling the cold
and the frost and the great rain and the sun again and the south wind
blowing in the glens youll not be sitting up on a wet ditch the way
youre after sitting in the place making yourself old with looking
on each day and it passing you by Youll be saying one time Its
a grand evening by the grace of God and another time Its a wild
night God help us but itll pass surely Youll be saying

DAN Goes over to them crying out impatiently Go out of that door Im
telling you and do your blathering below in the glen

Nora gathers a few things into her shawl

TRAMP At the door Come along with me now lady of the house and its
not my blather youll be hearing only but youll be hearing the herons
crying out over the black lakes and youll be hearing the grouse and
the owls with them and the larks and the big thrushes when the days
are warm and its not from the like of them youll be hearing a talk
of getting old like Peggy Cavanagh and losing the hair off you and the
light of your eyes but its fine songs youll be hearing when the sun
goes up and therell be no old fellow wheezing the like of a sick
sheep close to your ear

NORA Im thinking its myself will be wheezing that time with lying down
under the Heavens when the night is cold but youve a fine bit of talk
stranger and its with yourself Ill go

She goes towards the door then turns to Dan You think its a grand
thing youre after doing with your letting on to be dead but what is it
at all What way would a woman live in a lonesome place the like of this
place and she not making a talk with the men passing And what way
will yourself live from this day with none to care for you What is it
youll have now but a black life Daniel Burke and its not long Im
telling you till youll be lying again under that sheet and you dead
surely

She goes out with the Tramp Micheal is slinking after them but Dan
stops him

DAN Sit down now and take a little taste of the stuff Micheal Dara
Theres a great drouth on me and the night is young

MICHEAL Coming back to the table And its very dry I am surely with
the fear of death you put on me and I after driving mountain ewes since
the turn of the day

DAN Throwing away his stick I was thinking to strike you Micheal
Dara but youre a quiet man God help you and I dont mind you at all

He pours out two glasses of whisky and gives one to Micheal

DAN Your good health Micheal Dara

MICHEAL God reward you Daniel Burke and may you have a long life and
a quiet life and good health with it They drink
