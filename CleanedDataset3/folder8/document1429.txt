1 AT THE BAY

Chapter 1I

Very early morning The sun was not yet risen and the whole of Crescent
Bay was hidden under a white seamist The big bushcovered hills at the
back were smothered You could not see where they ended and the paddocks
and bungalows began The sandy road was gone and the paddocks and
bungalows the other side of it there were no white dunes covered with
reddish grass beyond them there was nothing to mark which was beach and
where was the sea A heavy dew had fallen The grass was blue Big drops
hung on the bushes and just did not fall the silvery fluffy toitoi
was limp on its long stalks and all the marigolds and the pinks in the
bungalow gardens were bowed to the earth with wetness Drenched were the
cold fuchsias round pearls of dew lay on the flat nasturtium leaves It
looked as though the sea had beaten up softly in the darkness as though
one immense wave had come rippling ripplinghow far Perhaps if you
had waked up in the middle of the night you might have seen a big fish
flicking in at the window and gone again

AhAah sounded the sleepy sea And from the bush there came the sound
of little streams flowing quickly lightly slipping between the smooth
stones gushing into ferny basins and out again and there was the
splashing of big drops on large leaves and something elsewhat was
ita faint stirring and shaking the snapping of a twig and then such
silence that it seemed some one was listening

Round the corner of Crescent Bay between the piledup masses of broken
rock a flock of sheep came pattering They were huddled together a
small tossing woolly mass and their thin sticklike legs trotted
along quickly as if the cold and the quiet had frightened them Behind
them an old sheepdog his soaking paws covered with sand ran along
with his nose to the ground but carelessly as if thinking of something
else And then in the rocky gateway the shepherd himself appeared He
was a lean upright old man in a frieze coat that was covered with a
web of tiny drops velvet trousers tied under the knee and a wideawake
with a folded blue handkerchief round the brim One hand was crammed
into his belt the other grasped a beautifully smooth yellow stick And
as he walked taking his time he kept up a very soft light whistling
an airy faraway fluting that sounded mournful and tender The old
dog cut an ancient caper or two and then drew up sharp ashamed of his
levity and walked a few dignified paces by his masters side The sheep
ran forward in little pattering rushes they began to bleat and ghostly
flocks and herds answered them from under the sea Baa Baaa For a
time they seemed to be always on the same piece of ground There ahead
was stretched the sandy road with shallow puddles the same soaking
bushes showed on either side and the same shadowy palings Then
something immense came into view an enormous shockhaired giant with
his arms stretched out It was the big gumtree outside Mrs Stubbs
shop and as they passed by there was a strong whiff of eucalyptus
And now big spots of light gleamed in the mist The shepherd stopped
whistling he rubbed his red nose and wet beard on his wet sleeve and
screwing up his eyes glanced in the direction of the sea The sun
was rising It was marvellous how quickly the mist thinned sped away
dissolved from the shallow plain rolled up from the bush and was gone
as if in a hurry to escape big twists and curls jostled and shouldered
each other as the silvery beams broadened The faraway skya bright
pure bluewas reflected in the puddles and the drops swimming along
the telegraph poles flashed into points of light Now the leaping
glittering sea was so bright it made ones eyes ache to look at it The
shepherd drew a pipe the bowl as small as an acorn out of his breast
pocket fumbled for a chunk of speckled tobacco pared off a few
shavings and stuffed the bowl He was a grave finelooking old man
As he lit up and the blue smoke wreathed his head the dog watching
looked proud of him

Baa Baaa The sheep spread out into a fan They were just clear of
the summer colony before the first sleeper turned over and lifted a
drowsy head their cry sounded in the dreams of little children who
lifted their arms to drag down to cuddle the darling little woolly
lambs of sleep Then the first inhabitant appeared it was the Burnells
cat Florrie sitting on the gatepost far too early as usual looking
for their milkgirl When she saw the old sheepdog she sprang up
quickly arched her back drew in her tabby head and seemed to give a
little fastidious shiver Ugh What a coarse revolting creature said
Florrie But the old sheepdog not looking up waggled past flinging
out his legs from side to side Only one of his ears twitched to prove
that he saw and thought her a silly young female

The breeze of morning lifted in the bush and the smell of leaves and wet
black earth mingled with the sharp smell of the sea Myriads of birds
were singing A goldfinch flew over the shepherds head and perching on
the tiptop of a spray it turned to the sun ruffling its small breast
feathers And now they had passed the fishermans hut passed the
charredlooking little whare where Leila the milkgirl lived with her
old Gran The sheep strayed over a yellow swamp and Wag the sheepdog
padded after rounded them up and headed them for the steeper narrower
rocky pass that led out of Crescent Bay and towards Daylight Cove Baa
Baa Faint the cry came as they rocked along the fastdrying road The
shepherd put away his pipe dropping it into his breastpocket so that
the little bowl hung over And straightway the soft airy whistling began
again Wag ran out along a ledge of rock after something that smelled
and ran back again disgusted Then pushing nudging hurrying the sheep
rounded the bend and the shepherd followed after out of sight


Chapter 1II

A few moments later the back door of one of the bungalows opened and a
figure in a broadstriped bathing suit flung down the paddock cleared
the stile rushed through the tussock grass into the hollow staggered
up the sandy hillock and raced for dear life over the big porous
stones over the cold wet pebbles on to the hard sand that gleamed
like oil SplishSplosh SplishSplosh The water bubbled round his
legs as Stanley Burnell waded out exulting First man in as usual Hed
beaten them all again And he swooped down to souse his head and neck

Hail brother All hail Thou Mighty One A velvety bass voice came
booming over the water

Great Scott Damnation take it Stanley lifted up to see a dark head
bobbing far out and an arm lifted It was Jonathan Troutthere before
him Glorious morning sang the voice

Yes very fine said Stanley briefly Why the dickens didnt the
fellow stick to his part of the sea Why should he come barging over to
this exact spot Stanley gave a kick a lunge and struck out swimming
overarm But Jonathan was a match for him Up he came his black hair
sleek on his forehead his short beard sleek

I had an extraordinary dream last night he shouted

What was the matter with the man This mania for conversation irritated
Stanley beyond words And it was always the samealways some piffle
about a dream hed had or some cranky idea hed got hold of or some
rot hed been reading Stanley turned over on his back and kicked with
his legs till he was a living waterspout But even then I dreamed I
was hanging over a terrifically high cliff shouting to some one below
You would be thought Stanley He could stick no more of it He stopped
splashing Look here Trout he said Im in rather a hurry this
morning

Youre WHAT Jonathan was so surprisedor pretended to bethat he
sank under the water then reappeared again blowing

All I mean is said Stanley Ive no time tototo fool about
I want to get this over Im in a hurry Ive work to do this
morningsee

Jonathan was gone before Stanley had finished Pass friend said the
bass voice gently and he slid away through the water with scarcely
a ripple But curse the fellow Hed ruined Stanleys bathe What an
unpractical idiot the man was Stanley struck out to sea again and
then as quickly swam in again and away he rushed up the beach He felt
cheated

Jonathan stayed a little longer in the water He floated gently moving
his hands like fins and letting the sea rock his long skinny body It
was curious but in spite of everything he was fond of Stanley Burnell
True he had a fiendish desire to tease him sometimes to poke fun at
him but at bottom he was sorry for the fellow There was something
pathetic in his determination to make a job of everything You couldnt
help feeling hed be caught out one day and then what an almighty
cropper hed come At that moment an immense wave lifted Jonathan rode
past him and broke along the beach with a joyful sound What a beauty
And now there came another That was the way to livecarelessly
recklessly spending oneself He got on to his feet and began to wade
towards the shore pressing his toes into the firm wrinkled sand To
take things easy not to fight against the ebb and flow of life but to
give way to itthat was what was needed It was this tension that was
all wrong To liveto live And the perfect morning so fresh and fair
basking in the light as though laughing at its own beauty seemed to
whisper Why not

But now he was out of the water Jonathan turned blue with cold He ached
all over it was as though some one was wringing the blood out of him
And stalking up the beach shivering all his muscles tight he too felt
his bathe was spoilt Hed stayed in too long


Chapter 1III

Beryl was alone in the livingroom when Stanley appeared wearing a blue
serge suit a stiff collar and a spotted tie He looked almost uncannily
clean and brushed he was going to town for the day Dropping into his
chair he pulled out his watch and put it beside his plate

Ive just got twentyfive minutes he said You might go and see if
the porridge is ready Beryl

Mothers just gone for it said Beryl She sat down at the table and
poured out his tea

Thanks Stanley took a sip Hallo he said in an astonished voice
youve forgotten the sugar

Oh sorry But even then Beryl didnt help him she pushed the basin
across What did this mean As Stanley helped himself his blue
eyes widened they seemed to quiver He shot a quick glance at his
sisterinlaw and leaned back

Nothing wrong is there he asked carelessly fingering his collar

Beryls head was bent she turned her plate in her fingers

Nothing said her light voice Then she too looked up and smiled at
Stanley Why should there be

Ooh No reason at all as far as I know I thought you seemed rather

At that moment the door opened and the three little girls appeared each
carrying a porridge plate They were dressed alike in blue jerseys and
knickers their brown legs were bare and each had her hair plaited
and pinned up in what was called a horses tail Behind them came Mrs
Fairfield with the tray

Carefully children she warned But they were taking the very
greatest care They loved being allowed to carry things Have you said
good morning to your father

Yes grandma They settled themselves on the bench opposite Stanley
and Beryl

Good morning Stanley Old Mrs Fairfield gave him his plate

Morning mother Hows the boy

Splendid He only woke up once last night What a perfect morning The
old woman paused her hand on the loaf of bread to gaze out of the
open door into the garden The sea sounded Through the wideopen
window streamed the sun on to the yellow varnished walls and bare floor
Everything on the table flashed and glittered In the middle there was
an old salad bowl filled with yellow and red nasturtiums She smiled
and a look of deep content shone in her eyes

You might cut me a slice of that bread mother said Stanley Ive
only twelve and a half minutes before the coach passes Has anyone given
my shoes to the servant girl

Yes theyre ready for you Mrs Fairfield was quite unruffled

Oh Kezia Why are you such a messy child cried Beryl despairingly

Me Aunt Beryl Kezia stared at her What had she done now She had
only dug a river down the middle of her porridge filled it and was
eating the banks away But she did that every single morning and no one
had said a word up till now

Why cant you eat your food properly like Isabel and Lottie How
unfair grownups are

But Lottie always makes a floating island dont you Lottie

I dont said Isabel smartly I just sprinkle mine with sugar and put
on the milk and finish it Only babies play with their food

Stanley pushed back his chair and got up

Would you get me those shoes mother And Beryl if youve finished
I wish youd cut down to the gate and stop the coach Run in to your
mother Isabel and ask her where my bowler hats been put Wait a
minutehave you children been playing with my stick

No father

But I put it here Stanley began to bluster I remember distinctly
putting it in this corner Now whos had it Theres no time to lose
Look sharp The sticks got to be found

Even Alice the servantgirl was drawn into the chase You havent
been using it to poke the kitchen fire with by any chance

Stanley dashed into the bedroom where Linda was lying Most
extraordinary thing I cant keep a single possession to myself Theyve
made away with my stick now

Stick dear What stick Lindas vagueness on these occasions could
not be real Stanley decided Would nobody sympathize with him

Coach Coach Stanley Beryls voice cried from the gate

Stanley waved his arm to Linda No time to say goodbye he cried And
he meant that as a punishment to her

He snatched his bowler hat dashed out of the house and swung down the
garden path Yes the coach was there waiting and Beryl leaning over
the open gate was laughing up at somebody or other just as if nothing
had happened The heartlessness of women The way they took it for
granted it was your job to slave away for them while they didnt even
take the trouble to see that your walkingstick wasnt lost Kelly
trailed his whip across the horses

Goodbye Stanley called Beryl sweetly and gaily It was easy enough
to say goodbye And there she stood idle shading her eyes with her
hand The worst of it was Stanley had to shout goodbye too for the
sake of appearances Then he saw her turn give a little skip and run
back to the house She was glad to be rid of him

Yes she was thankful Into the livingroom she ran and called Hes
gone Linda cried from her room Beryl Has Stanley gone Old Mrs
Fairfield appeared carrying the boy in his little flannel coatee

Gone

Gone

Oh the relief the difference it made to have the man out of the house
Their very voices were changed as they called to one another they
sounded warm and loving and as if they shared a secret Beryl went over
to the table Have another cup of tea mother Its still hot She
wanted somehow to celebrate the fact that they could do what they
liked now There was no man to disturb them the whole perfect day was
theirs

No thank you child said old Mrs Fairfield but the way at that
moment she tossed the boy up and said agoosagoosaga to him
meant that she felt the same The little girls ran into the paddock like
chickens let out of a coop

Even Alice the servantgirl washing up the dishes in the kitchen
caught the infection and used the precious tank water in a perfectly
reckless fashion

Oh these men said she and she plunged the teapot into the bowl and
held it under the water even after it had stopped bubbling as if it too
was a man and drowning was too good for them


Chapter 1IV

Wait for me Isabel Kezia wait for me

There was poor little Lottie left behind again because she found it so
fearfully hard to get over the stile by herself When she stood on the
first step her knees began to wobble she grasped the post Then you had
to put one leg over But which leg She never could decide And when she
did finally put one leg over with a sort of stamp of despairthen the
feeling was awful She was half in the paddock still and half in the
tussock grass She clutched the post desperately and lifted up her
voice Wait for me

No dont you wait for her Kezia said Isabel Shes such a little
silly Shes always making a fuss Come on And she tugged Kezias
jersey You can use my bucket if you come with me she said kindly
Its bigger than yours But Kezia couldnt leave Lottie all by
herself She ran back to her By this time Lottie was very red in the
face and breathing heavily

Here put your other foot over said Kezia

Where

Lottie looked down at Kezia as if from a mountain height

Here where my hand is Kezia patted the place

Oh there do you mean Lottie gave a deep sigh and put the second foot
over

Nowsort of turn round and sit down and slide said Kezia

But theres nothing to sit down on Kezia said Lottie

She managed it at last and once it was over she shook herself and began
to beam

Im getting better at climbing over stiles arent I Kezia

Lotties was a very hopeful nature

The pink and the blue sunbonnet followed Isabels bright red sunbonnet
up that sliding slipping hill At the top they paused to decide where
to go and to have a good stare at who was there already Seen from
behind standing against the skyline gesticulating largely with their
spades they looked like minute puzzled explorers

The whole family of Samuel Josephs was there already with their
ladyhelp who sat on a campstool and kept order with a whistle that
she wore tied round her neck and a small cane with which she directed
operations The Samuel Josephs never played by themselves or managed
their own game If they did it ended in the boys pouring water down
the girls necks or the girls trying to put little black crabs into the
boys pockets So Mrs S J and the poor ladyhelp drew up what she
called a brogramme every morning to keep them abused and out of
bischief It was all competitions or races or round games Everything
began with a piercing blast of the ladyhelps whistle and ended with
another There were even prizeslarge rather dirty paper parcels which
the ladyhelp with a sour little smile drew out of a bulging string
kit The Samuel Josephs fought fearfully for the prizes and cheated and
pinched one anothers armsthey were all expert pinchers The only time
the Burnell children ever played with them Kezia had got a prize
and when she undid three bits of paper she found a very small rusty
buttonhook She couldnt understand why they made such a fuss

But they never played with the Samuel Josephs now or even went to their
parties The Samuel Josephs were always giving childrens parties at
the Bay and there was always the same food A big washhand basin of
very brown fruitsalad buns cut into four and a washhand jug full of
something the ladyhelp called Limonadear And you went away in the
evening with half the frill torn off your frock or something spilled all
down the front of your openwork pinafore leaving the Samuel Josephs
leaping like savages on their lawn No They were too awful

On the other side of the beach close down to the water two little
boys their knickers rolled up twinkled like spiders One was digging
the other pattered in and out of the water filling a small bucket They
were the Trout boys Pip and Rags But Pip was so busy digging and Rags
was so busy helping that they didnt see their little cousins until they
were quite close

Look said Pip Look what Ive discovered And he showed them an old
wet squashedlooking boot The three little girls stared

Whatever are you going to do with it asked Kezia

Keep it of course Pip was very scornful Its a findsee

Yes Kezia saw that All the same

Theres lots of things buried in the sand explained Pip They get
chucked up from wrecks Treasure Whyyou might find

But why does Rags have to keep on pouring water in asked Lottie

Oh thats to moisten it said Pip to make the work a bit easier
Keep it up Rags

And good little Rags ran up and down pouring in the water that turned
brown like cocoa

Here shall I show you what I found yesterday said Pip mysteriously
and he stuck his spade into the sand Promise not to tell

They promised

Say cross my heart straight dinkum

The little girls said it

Pip took something out of his pocket rubbed it a long time on the front
of his jersey then breathed on it and rubbed it again

Now turn round he ordered

They turned round

All look the same way Keep still Now

And his hand opened he held up to the light something that flashed
that winked that was a most lovely green

Its a nemeral said Pip solemnly

Is it really Pip Even Isabel was impressed

The lovely green thing seemed to dance in Pips fingers Aunt Beryl had
a nemeral in a ring but it was a very small one This one was as big as
a star and far more beautiful


Chapter 1V

As the morning lengthened whole parties appeared over the sandhills
and came down on the beach to bathe It was understood that at eleven
oclock the women and children of the summer colony had the sea to
themselves First the women undressed pulled on their bathing dresses
and covered their heads in hideous caps like sponge bags then the
children were unbuttoned The beach was strewn with little heaps of
clothes and shoes the big summer hats with stones on them to keep them
from blowing away looked like immense shells It was strange that even
the sea seemed to sound differently when all those leaping laughing
figures ran into the waves Old Mrs Fairfield in a lilac cotton dress
and a black hat tied under the chin gathered her little brood and got
them ready The little Trout boys whipped their shirts over their heads
and away the five sped while their grandma sat with one hand in her
knittingbag ready to draw out the ball of wool when she was satisfied
they were safely in

The firm compact little girls were not half so brave as the tender
delicatelooking little boys Pip and Rags shivering crouching down
slapping the water never hesitated But Isabel who could swim twelve
strokes and Kezia who could nearly swim eight only followed on the
strict understanding they were not to be splashed As for Lottie she
didnt follow at all She liked to be left to go in her own way
please And that way was to sit down at the edge of the water her legs
straight her knees pressed together and to make vague motions with her
arms as if she expected to be wafted out to sea But when a bigger wave
than usual an old whiskery one came lolloping along in her direction
she scrambled to her feet with a face of horror and flew up the beach
again

Here mother keep those for me will you

Two rings and a thin gold chain were dropped into Mrs Fairfields lap

Yes dear But arent you going to bathe here

Noo Beryl drawled She sounded vague Im undressing farther along
Im going to bathe with Mrs Harry Kember

Very well But Mrs Fairfields lips set She disapproved of Mrs Harry
Kember Beryl knew it

Poor old mother she smiled as she skimmed over the stones Poor old
mother Old Oh what joy what bliss it was to be young

You look very pleased said Mrs Harry Kember She sat hunched up on
the stones her arms round her knees smoking

Its such a lovely day said Beryl smiling down at her

Oh my dear Mrs Harry Kembers voice sounded as though she knew
better than that But then her voice always sounded as though she
knew something better about you than you did yourself She was a long
strangelooking woman with narrow hands and feet Her face too was
long and narrow and exhaustedlooking even her fair curled fringe
looked burnt out and withered She was the only woman at the Bay who
smoked and she smoked incessantly keeping the cigarette between her
lips while she talked and only taking it out when the ash was so long
you could not understand why it did not fall When she was not playing
bridgeshe played bridge every day of her lifeshe spent her time
lying in the full glare of the sun She could stand any amount of
it she never had enough All the same it did not seem to warm her
Parched withered cold she lay stretched on the stones like a piece
of tossedup driftwood The women at the Bay thought she was very very
fast Her lack of vanity her slang the way she treated men as though
she was one of them and the fact that she didnt care twopence about
her house and called the servant Gladys Gladeyes was disgraceful
Standing on the veranda steps Mrs Kember would call in her indifferent
tired voice I say Gladeyes you might heave me a handkerchief if
Ive got one will you And Gladeyes a red bow in her hair instead of
a cap and white shoes came running with an impudent smile It was an
absolute scandal True she had no children and her husband Here the
voices were always raised they became fervent How can he have married
her How can he how can he It must have been money of course but
even then

Mrs Kembers husband was at least ten years younger than she was and
so incredibly handsome that he looked like a mask or a most perfect
illustration in an American novel rather than a man Black hair dark
blue eyes red lips a slow sleepy smile a fine tennis player a
perfect dancer and with it all a mystery Harry Kember was like a man
walking in his sleep Men couldnt stand him they couldnt get a word
out of the chap he ignored his wife just as she ignored him How did
he live Of course there were stories but such stories They simply
couldnt be told The women hed been seen with the places hed been
seen in but nothing was ever certain nothing definite Some of the
women at the Bay privately thought hed commit a murder one day Yes
even while they talked to Mrs Kember and took in the awful concoction
she was wearing they saw her stretched as she lay on the beach but
cold bloody and still with a cigarette stuck in the corner of her
mouth

Mrs Kember rose yawned unsnapped her belt buckle and tugged at the
tape of her blouse And Beryl stepped out of her skirt and shed her
jersey and stood up in her short white petticoat and her camisole with
ribbon bows on the shoulders

Mercy on us said Mrs Harry Kember what a little beauty you are

Dont said Beryl softly but drawing off one stocking and then the
other she felt a little beauty

My dearwhy not said Mrs Harry Kember stamping on her own
petticoat Reallyher underclothes A pair of blue cotton knickers and
a linen bodice that reminded one somehow of a pillowcase And you
dont wear stays do you She touched Beryls waist and Beryl sprang
away with a small affected cry Then Never she said firmly

Lucky little creature sighed Mrs Kember unfastening her own

Beryl turned her back and began the complicated movements of some one
who is trying to take off her clothes and to pull on her bathingdress
all at one and the same time

Oh my deardont mind me said Mrs Harry Kember Why be shy I
shant eat you I shant be shocked like those other ninnies And she
gave her strange neighing laugh and grimaced at the other women

But Beryl was shy She never undressed in front of anybody Was that
silly Mrs Harry Kember made her feel it was silly even something
to be ashamed of Why be shy indeed She glanced quickly at her friend
standing so boldly in her torn chemise and lighting a fresh cigarette
and a quick bold evil feeling started up in her breast Laughing
recklessly she drew on the limp sandyfeeling bathingdress that was
not quite dry and fastened the twisted buttons

Thats better said Mrs Harry Kember They began to go down the
beach together Really its a sin for you to wear clothes my dear
Somebodys got to tell you some day

The water was quite warm It was that marvellous transparent blue
flecked with silver but the sand at the bottom looked gold when you
kicked with your toes there rose a little puff of golddust Now the
waves just reached her breast Beryl stood her arms outstretched
gazing out and as each wave came she gave the slightest little jump so
that it seemed it was the wave which lifted her so gently

I believe in pretty girls having a good time said Mrs Harry Kember
Why not Dont you make a mistake my dear Enjoy yourself And
suddenly she turned turtle disappeared and swam away quickly quickly
like a rat Then she flicked round and began swimming back She was
going to say something else Beryl felt that she was being poisoned
by this cold woman but she longed to hear But oh how strange how
horrible As Mrs Harry Kember came up close she looked in her black
waterproof bathingcap with her sleepy face lifted above the water
just her chin touching like a horrible caricature of her husband


Chapter 1VI

In a steamer chair under a manuka tree that grew in the middle of
the front grass patch Linda Burnell dreamed the morning away She did
nothing She looked up at the dark close dry leaves of the manuka at
the chinks of blue between and now and again a tiny yellowish flower
dropped on her Prettyyes if you held one of those flowers on the
palm of your hand and looked at it closely it was an exquisite small
thing Each pale yellow petal shone as if each was the careful work of a
loving hand The tiny tongue in the centre gave it the shape of a bell
And when you turned it over the outside was a deep bronze colour But
as soon as they flowered they fell and were scattered You brushed them
off your frock as you talked the horrid little things got caught in
ones hair Why then flower at all Who takes the troubleor the
joyto make all these things that are wasted wasted It was uncanny

On the grass beside her lying between two pillows was the boy Sound
asleep he lay his head turned away from his mother His fine dark hair
looked more like a shadow than like real hair but his ear was a bright
deep coral Linda clasped her hands above her head and crossed her feet
It was very pleasant to know that all these bungalows were empty that
everybody was down on the beach out of sight out of hearing She had
the garden to herself she was alone

Dazzling white the picotees shone the goldeneyed marigold glittered
the nasturtiums wreathed the veranda poles in green and gold flame If
only one had time to look at these flowers long enough time to get over
the sense of novelty and strangeness time to know them But as soon as
one paused to part the petals to discover the underside of the leaf
along came Life and one was swept away And lying in her cane chair
Linda felt so light she felt like a leaf Along came Life like a wind
and she was seized and shaken she had to go Oh dear would it always
be so Was there no escape

 Now she sat on the veranda of their Tasmanian home leaning against
her fathers knee And he promised As soon as you and I are old
enough Linny well cut off somewhere well escape Two boys together
I have a fancy Id like to sail up a river in China Linda saw that
river very wide covered with little rafts and boats She saw the
yellow hats of the boatmen and she heard their high thin voices as they
called

Yes papa

But just then a very broad young man with bright ginger hair walked
slowly past their house and slowly solemnly even uncovered Lindas
father pulled her ear teasingly in the way he had

Linnys beau he whispered

Oh papa fancy being married to Stanley Burnell

Well she was married to him And what was more she loved him Not
the Stanley whom every one saw not the everyday one but a timid
sensitive innocent Stanley who knelt down every night to say his
prayers and who longed to be good Stanley was simple If he believed
in peopleas he believed in her for instanceit was with his whole
heart He could not be disloyal he could not tell a lie And how
terribly he suffered if he thought any oneshewas not being dead
straight dead sincere with him This is too subtle for me He flung
out the words but his open quivering distraught look was like the
look of a trapped beast

But the trouble washere Linda felt almost inclined to laugh though
Heaven knows it was no laughing mattershe saw her Stanley so seldom
There were glimpses moments breathing spaces of calm but all the rest
of the time it was like living in a house that couldnt be cured of the
habit of catching on fire on a ship that got wrecked every day And it
was always Stanley who was in the thick of the danger Her whole time
was spent in rescuing him and restoring him and calming him down and
listening to his story And what was left of her time was spent in the
dread of having children

Linda frowned she sat up quickly in her steamer chair and clasped her
ankles Yes that was her real grudge against life that was what she
could not understand That was the question she asked and asked and
listened in vain for the answer It was all very well to say it was
the common lot of women to bear children It wasnt true She for one
could prove that wrong She was broken made weak her courage was gone
through childbearing And what made it doubly hard to bear was she did
not love her children It was useless pretending Even if she had had
the strength she never would have nursed and played with the little
girls No it was as though a cold breath had chilled her through and
through on each of those awful journeys she had no warmth left to give
them As to the boywell thank Heaven mother had taken him he was
mothers or Beryls or anybodys who wanted him She had hardly
held him in her arms She was so indifferent about him that as he lay
there Linda glanced down

The boy had turned over He lay facing her and he was no longer asleep
His darkblue baby eyes were open he looked as though he was peeping
at his mother And suddenly his face dimpled it broke into a wide
toothless smile a perfect beam no less

Im here that happy smile seemed to say Why dont you like me

There was something so quaint so unexpected about that smile that Linda
smiled herself But she checked herself and said to the boy coldly I
dont like babies

Dont like babies The boy couldnt believe her Dont like me He
waved his arms foolishly at his mother

Linda dropped off her chair on to the grass

Why do you keep on smiling she said severely If you knew what I was
thinking about you wouldnt

But he only squeezed up his eyes slyly and rolled his head on the
pillow He didnt believe a word she said

We know all about that smiled the boy

Linda was so astonished at the confidence of this little creature Ah
no be sincere That was not what she felt it was something far
different it was something so new so The tears danced in her eyes
she breathed in a small whisper to the boy Hallo my funny

But by now the boy had forgotten his mother He was serious again
Something pink something soft waved in front of him He made a grab at
it and it immediately disappeared But when he lay back another like
the first appeared This time he determined to catch it He made a
tremendous effort and rolled right over


Chapter 1VII

The tide was out the beach was deserted lazily flopped the warm sea
The sun beat down beat down hot and fiery on the fine sand baking
the grey and blue and black and whiteveined pebbles It sucked up the
little drop of water that lay in the hollow of the curved shells it
bleached the pink convolvulus that threaded through and through
the sandhills Nothing seemed to move but the small sandhoppers
Pitpitpit They were never still

Over there on the weedhung rocks that looked at low tide like shaggy
beasts come down to the water to drink the sunlight seemed to spin like
a silver coin dropped into each of the small rock pools They danced
they quivered and minute ripples laved the porous shores Looking
down bending over each pool was like a lake with pink and blue houses
clustered on the shores and oh the vast mountainous country behind
those housesthe ravines the passes the dangerous creeks and
fearful tracks that led to the waters edge Underneath waved the
seaforestpink threadlike trees velvet anemones and orange
berryspotted weeds Now a stone on the bottom moved rocked and there
was a glimpse of a black feeler now a threadlike creature wavered by
and was lost Something was happening to the pink waving trees they
were changing to a cold moonlight blue And now there sounded the
faintest plop Who made that sound What was going on down there And
how strong how damp the seaweed smelt in the hot sun

The green blinds were drawn in the bungalows of the summer colony Over
the verandas prone on the paddock flung over the fences there were
exhaustedlooking bathingdresses and rough striped towels Each back
window seemed to have a pair of sandshoes on the sill and some lumps of
rock or a bucket or a collection of pawa shells The bush quivered in
a haze of heat the sandy road was empty except for the Trouts dog
Snooker who lay stretched in the very middle of it His blue eye
was turned up his legs stuck out stiffly and he gave an occasional
desperatesounding puff as much as to say he had decided to make an end
of it and was only waiting for some kind cart to come along

What are you looking at my grandma Why do you keep stopping and sort
of staring at the wall

Kezia and her grandmother were taking their siesta together The little
girl wearing only her short drawers and her underbodice her arms and
legs bare lay on one of the puffedup pillows of her grandmas bed and
the old woman in a white ruffled dressinggown sat in a rocker at the
window with a long piece of pink knitting in her lap This room
that they shared like the other rooms of the bungalow was of light
varnished wood and the floor was bare The furniture was of the
shabbiest the simplest The dressingtable for instance was a
packingcase in a sprigged muslin petticoat and the mirror above was
very strange it was as though a little piece of forked lightning was
imprisoned in it On the table there stood a jar of seapinks pressed
so tightly together they looked more like a velvet pincushion and a
special shell which Kezia had given her grandma for a pintray and
another even more special which she had thought would make a very nice
place for a watch to curl up in

Tell me grandma said Kezia

The old woman sighed whipped the wool twice round her thumb and drew
the bone needle through She was casting on

I was thinking of your Uncle William darling she said quietly

My Australian Uncle William said Kezia She had another

Yes of course

The one I never saw

That was the one

Well what happened to him Kezia knew perfectly well but she wanted
to be told again

He went to the mines and he got a sunstroke there and died said old
Mrs Fairfield

Kezia blinked and considered the picture again a little man fallen
over like a tin soldier by the side of a big black hole

Does it make you sad to think about him grandma She hated her
grandma to be sad

It was the old womans turn to consider Did it make her sad To look
back back To stare down the years as Kezia had seen her doing To
look after them as a woman does long after they were out of sight Did
it make her sad No life was like that

No Kezia

But why asked Kezia She lifted one bare arm and began to draw things
in the air Why did Uncle William have to die He wasnt old

Mrs Fairfield began counting the stitches in threes It just
happened she said in an absorbed voice

Does everybody have to die asked Kezia

Everybody

Me Kezia sounded fearfully incredulous

Some day my darling

But grandma Kezia waved her left leg and waggled the toes They felt
sandy What if I just wont

The old woman sighed again and drew a long thread from the ball

Were not asked Kezia she said sadly It happens to all of us
sooner or later

Kezia lay still thinking this over She didnt want to die It meant she
would have to leave here leave everywhere for ever leaveleave her
grandma She rolled over quickly

Grandma she said in a startled voice

What my pet

Youre not to die Kezia was very decided

Ah Keziaher grandma looked up and smiled and shook her headdont
lets talk about it

But youre not to You couldnt leave me You couldnt not be there
This was awful Promise me you wont ever do it grandma pleaded
Kezia

The old woman went on knitting

Promise me Say never

But still her grandma was silent

Kezia rolled off her bed she couldnt bear it any longer and lightly
she leapt on to her grandmas knees clasped her hands round the old
womans throat and began kissing her under the chin behind the ear
and blowing down her neck

Say never say never say never She gasped between the kisses And
then she began very softly and lightly to tickle her grandma

Kezia The old woman dropped her knitting She swung back in the
rocker She began to tickle Kezia Say never say never say never
gurgled Kezia while they lay there laughing in each others arms
Come thats enough my squirrel Thats enough my wild pony said
old Mrs Fairfield setting her cap straight Pick up my knitting

Both of them had forgotten what the never was about


Chapter 1VIII

The sun was still full on the garden when the back door of the Burnells
shut with a bang and a very gay figure walked down the path to the
gate It was Alice the servantgirl dressed for her afternoon out She
wore a white cotton dress with such large red spots on it and so many
that they made you shudder white shoes and a leghorn turned up under
the brim with poppies Of course she wore gloves white ones stained
at the fastenings with ironmould and in one hand she carried a very
dashedlooking sunshade which she referred to as her perishall

Beryl sitting in the window fanning her freshlywashed hair thought
she had never seen such a guy If Alice had only blacked her face with
a piece of cork before she started out the picture would have been
complete And where did a girl like that go to in a place like this The
heartshaped Fijian fan beat scornfully at that lovely bright mane She
supposed Alice had picked up some horrible common larrikin and theyd
go off into the bush together Pity to have made herself so conspicuous
theyd have hard work to hide with Alice in that rigout

But no Beryl was unfair Alice was going to tea with Mrs Stubbs whod
sent her an invite by the little boy who called for orders She had
taken ever such a liking to Mrs Stubbs ever since the first time she
went to the shop to get something for her mosquitoes

Dear heart Mrs Stubbs had clapped her hand to her side I never
seen anyone so eaten You might have been attacked by canningbals

Alice did wish thered been a bit of life on the road though Made her
feel so queer having nobody behind her Made her feel all weak in the
spine She couldnt believe that some one wasnt watching her And yet
it was silly to turn round it gave you away She pulled up her gloves
hummed to herself and said to the distant gumtree Shant be long
now But that was hardly company

Mrs Stubbss shop was perched on a little hillock just off the road It
had two big windows for eyes a broad veranda for a hat and the sign on
the roof scrawled MRS STUBBSS was like a little card stuck rakishly
in the hat crown

On the veranda there hung a long string of bathingdresses clinging
together as though theyd just been rescued from the sea rather than
waiting to go in and beside them there hung a cluster of sandshoes so
extraordinarily mixed that to get at one pair you had to tear apart and
forcibly separate at least fifty Even then it was the rarest thing
to find the left that belonged to the right So many people had lost
patience and gone off with one shoe that fitted and one that was a
little too big Mrs Stubbs prided herself on keeping something
of everything The two windows arranged in the form of precarious
pyramids were crammed so tight piled so high that it seemed only a
conjurer could prevent them from toppling over In the lefthand corner
of one window glued to the pane by four gelatine lozenges there
wasand there had been from time immemoriala notice

LOST HANSOME GOLE BROOCH SOLID GOLD ON OR NEAR BEACH REWARD OFFERED

Alice pressed open the door The bell jangled the red serge curtains
parted and Mrs Stubbs appeared With her broad smile and the long
bacon knife in her hand she looked like a friendly brigand Alice was
welcomed so warmly that she found it quite difficult to keep up her
manners They consisted of persistent little coughs and hems pulls at
her gloves tweaks at her skirt and a curious difficulty in seeing what
was set before her or understanding what was said

Tea was laid on the parlour tableham sardines a whole pound
of butter and such a large johnny cake that it looked like an
advertisement for somebodys bakingpowder But the Primus stove roared
so loudly that it was useless to try to talk above it Alice sat down
on the edge of a basketchair while Mrs Stubbs pumped the stove
still higher Suddenly Mrs Stubbs whipped the cushion off a chair and
disclosed a large brownpaper parcel

Ive just had some new photers taken my dear she shouted cheerfully
to Alice Tell me what you think of them

In a very dainty refined way Alice wet her finger and put the tissue
back from the first one Life How many there were There were three
dozzing at least And she held it up to the light

Mrs Stubbs sat in an armchair leaning very much to one side There
was a look of mild astonishment on her large face and well there might
be For though the armchair stood on a carpet to the left of it
miraculously skirting the carpetborder there was a dashing waterfall
On her right stood a Grecian pillar with a giant ferntree on either
side of it and in the background towered a gaunt mountain pale with
snow

It is a nice style isnt it shouted Mrs Stubbs and Alice had
just screamed Sweetly when the roaring of the Primus stove died
down fizzled out ceased and she said Pretty in a silence that was
frightening

Draw up your chair my dear said Mrs Stubbs beginning to pour out
Yes she said thoughtfully as she handed the tea but I dont care
about the size Im having an enlargemint All very well for Christmas
cards but I never was the one for small photers myself You get no
comfort out of them To say the truth I find them diseartening

Alice quite saw what she meant

Size said Mrs Stubbs Give me size That was what my poor dear
husband was always saying He couldnt stand anything small Gave him
the creeps And strange as it may seem my dearhere Mrs Stubbs
creaked and seemed to expand herself at the memoryit was dropsy that
carried him off at the larst Manys the time they drawn one and a half
pints from im at the ospital It seemed like a judgmint

Alice burned to know exactly what it was that was drawn from him She
ventured I suppose it was water

But Mrs Stubbs fixed Alice with her eyes and replied meaningly It was
liquid my dear

Liquid Alice jumped away from the word like a cat and came back to it
nosing and wary

Thats im said Mrs Stubbs and she pointed dramatically to the
lifesize head and shoulders of a burly man with a dead white rose in
the buttonhole of his coat that made you think of a curl of cold mutting
fat Just below in silver letters on a red cardboard ground were the
words Be not afraid it is I

Its ever such a fine face said Alice faintly

The paleblue bow on the top of Mrs Stubbss fair frizzy hair quivered
She arched her plump neck What a neck she had It was bright pink where
it began and then it changed to warm apricot and that faded to the
colour of a brown egg and then to a deep creamy

All the same my dear she said surprisingly freedoms best Her
soft fat chuckle sounded like a purr Freedoms best said Mrs
Stubbs again

Freedom Alice gave a loud silly little titter She felt awkward Her
mind flew back to her own kitching Ever so queer She wanted to be back
in it again


Chapter 1IX

A strange company assembled in the Burnells washhouse after tea Round
the table there sat a bull a rooster a donkey that kept forgetting it
was a donkey a sheep and a bee The washhouse was the perfect place for
such a meeting because they could make as much noise as they liked and
nobody ever interrupted It was a small tin shed standing apart from the
bungalow Against the wall there was a deep trough and in the corner a
copper with a basket of clothespegs on top of it The little window
spun over with cobwebs had a piece of candle and a mousetrap on the
dusty sill There were clotheslines crisscrossed overhead and hanging
from a peg on the wall a very big a huge rusty horseshoe The table
was in the middle with a form at either side

You cant be a bee Kezia A bees not an animal Its a ninseck

Oh but I do want to be a bee frightfully wailed Kezia A tiny bee
all yellowfurry with striped legs She drew her legs up under her and
leaned over the table She felt she was a bee

A ninseck must be an animal she said stoutly It makes a noise Its
not like a fish

Im a bull Im a bull cried Pip And he gave such a tremendous
bellowhow did he make that noisethat Lottie looked quite alarmed

Ill be a sheep said little Rags A whole lot of sheep went past
this morning

How do you know

Dad heard them Baa He sounded like the little lamb that trots behind
and seems to wait to be carried

Cockadoodledo shrilled Isabel With her red cheeks and bright eyes
she looked like a rooster

Whatll I be Lottie asked everybody and she sat there smiling
waiting for them to decide for her It had to be an easy one

Be a donkey Lottie It was Kezias suggestion Heehaw You cant
forget that

Heehaw said Lottie solemnly When do I have to say it

Ill explain Ill explain said the bull It was he who had the
cards He waved them round his head All be quiet All listen And he
waited for them Look here Lottie He turned up a card Its got two
spots on itsee Now if you put that card in the middle and somebody
else has one with two spots as well you say Heehaw and the cards
yours

Mine Lottie was roundeyed To keep

No silly Just for the game see Just while were playing The bull
was very cross with her

Oh Lottie you are a little silly said the proud rooster

Lottie looked at both of them Then she hung her head her lip quivered
I dont want to play she whispered The others glanced at one another
like conspirators All of them knew what that meant She would go away
and be discovered somewhere standing with her pinny thrown over her
head in a corner or against a wall or even behind a chair

Yes you do Lottie Its quite easy said Kezia

And Isabel repentant said exactly like a grownup Watch me Lottie
and youll soon learn

Cheer up Lot said Pip There I know what Ill do Ill give you
the first one Its mine really but Ill give it to you Here you
are And he slammed the card down in front of Lottie

Lottie revived at that But now she was in another difficulty I
havent got a hanky she said I want one badly too

Here Lottie you can use mine Rags dipped into his sailor blouse and
brought up a very wetlooking one knotted together Be very careful
he warned her Only use that corner Dont undo it Ive got a little
starfish inside Im going to try and tame

Oh come on you girls said the bull And mindyoure not to look
at your cards Youve got to keep your hands under the table till I say
Go

Smack went the cards round the table They tried with all their might to
see but Pip was too quick for them It was very exciting sitting there
in the washhouse it was all they could do not to burst into a little
chorus of animals before Pip had finished dealing

Now Lottie you begin

Timidly Lottie stretched out a hand took the top card off her pack had
a good look at itit was plain she was counting the spotsand put it
down

No Lottie you cant do that You mustnt look first You must turn it
the other way over

But then everybody will see it the same time as me said Lottie

The game proceeded Mooeoooer The bull was terrible He charged over
the table and seemed to eat the cards up

Bssss said the bee

Cockadoodledo Isabel stood up in her excitement and moved her elbows
like wings

Baa Little Rags put down the King of Diamonds and Lottie put down the
one they called the King of Spain She had hardly any cards left

Why dont you call out Lottie

Ive forgotten what I am said the donkey woefully

Well change Be a dog instead Bowwow

Oh yes Thats much easier Lottie smiled again But when she and
Kezia both had a one Kezia waited on purpose The others made signs to
Lottie and pointed Lottie turned very red she looked bewildered and
at last she said Heehaw Kezia

Ss Wait a minute They were in the very thick of it when the bull
stopped them holding up his hand Whats that Whats that noise

What noise What do you mean asked the rooster

Ss Shut up Listen They were mousestill I thought I heard aa
sort of knocking said the bull

What was it like asked the sheep faintly

No answer

The bee gave a shudder Whatever did we shut the door for she said
softly Oh why why had they shut the door

While they were playing the day had faded the gorgeous sunset had
blazed and died And now the quick dark came racing over the sea over
the sandhills up the paddock You were frightened to look in the
corners of the washhouse and yet you had to look with all your might
And somewhere far away grandma was lighting a lamp The blinds
were being pulled down the kitchen fire leapt in the tins on the
mantelpiece

It would be awful now said the bull if a spider was to fall from
the ceiling on to the table wouldnt it

Spiders dont fall from ceilings

Yes they do Our Min told us shed seen a spider as big as a saucer
with long hairs on it like a gooseberry

Quickly all the little heads were jerked up all the little bodies drew
together pressed together

Why doesnt somebody come and call us cried the rooster

Oh those grownups laughing and snug sitting in the lamplight
drinking out of cups Theyd forgotten about them No not really
forgotten That was what their smile meant They had decided to leave
them there all by themselves

Suddenly Lottie gave such a piercing scream that all of them jumped off
the forms all of them screamed too A facea face looking shrieked
Lottie

It was true it was real Pressed against the window was a pale face
black eyes a black beard

Grandma Mother Somebody

But they had not got to the door tumbling over one another before it
opened for Uncle Jonathan He had come to take the little boys home


Chapter 1X

He had meant to be there before but in the front garden he had come
upon Linda walking up and down the grass stopping to pick off a dead
pink or give a topheavy carnation something to lean against or to take
a deep breath of something and then walking on again with her little
air of remoteness Over her white frock she wore a yellow pinkfringed
shawl from the Chinamans shop

Hallo Jonathan called Linda And Jonathan whipped off his shabby
panama pressed it against his breast dropped on one knee and kissed
Lindas hand

Greeting my Fair One Greeting my Celestial Peach Blossom boomed
the bass voice gently Where are the other noble dames

Beryls out playing bridge and mothers giving the boy his bath Have
you come to borrow something

The Trouts were for ever running out of things and sending across to the
Burnells at the last moment

But Jonathan only answered A little love a little kindness and he
walked by his sisterinlaws side

Linda dropped into Beryls hammock under the manukatree and Jonathan
stretched himself on the grass beside her pulled a long stalk and began
chewing it They knew each other well The voices of children cried from
the other gardens A fishermans light cart shook along the sandy road
and from far away they heard a dog barking it was muffled as though the
dog had its head in a sack If you listened you could just hear the soft
swish of the sea at full tide sweeping the pebbles The sun was sinking

And so you go back to the office on Monday do you Jonathan asked
Linda

On Monday the cage door opens and clangs to upon the victim for another
eleven months and a week answered Jonathan

Linda swung a little It must be awful she said slowly

Would ye have me laugh my fair sister Would ye have me weep

Linda was so accustomed to Jonathans way of talking that she paid no
attention to it

I suppose she said vaguely one gets used to it One gets used to
anything

Does one Hum The Hum was so deep it seemed to boom from underneath
the ground I wonder how its done brooded Jonathan Ive never
managed it

Looking at him as he lay there Linda thought again how attractive he
was It was strange to think that he was only an ordinary clerk that
Stanley earned twice as much money as he What was the matter with
Jonathan He had no ambition she supposed that was it And yet one felt
he was gifted exceptional He was passionately fond of music every
spare penny he had went on books He was always full of new ideas
schemes plans But nothing came of it all The new fire blazed in
Jonathan you almost heard it roaring softly as he explained described
and dilated on the new thing but a moment later it had fallen in and
there was nothing but ashes and Jonathan went about with a look like
hunger in his black eyes At these times he exaggerated his absurd
manner of speaking and he sang in churchhe was the leader of the
choirwith such fearful dramatic intensity that the meanest hymn put on
an unholy splendour

It seems to me just as imbecile just as infernal to have to go to the
office on Monday said Jonathan as it always has done and always will
do To spend all the best years of ones life sitting on a stool from
nine to five scratching in somebodys ledger Its a queer use to make
of ones one and only life isnt it Or do I fondly dream He
rolled over on the grass and looked up at Linda Tell me what is the
difference between my life and that of an ordinary prisoner The only
difference I can see is that I put myself in jail and nobodys ever
going to let me out Thats a more intolerable situation than the other
For if Id beenpushed in against my willkicking evenonce the
door was locked or at any rate in five years or so I might have
accepted the fact and begun to take an interest in the flight of
flies or counting the warders steps along the passage with particular
attention to variations of tread and so on But as it is Im like an
insect thats flown into a room of its own accord I dash against the
walls dash against the windows flop against the ceiling do everything
on Gods earth in fact except fly out again And all the while Im
thinking like that moth or that butterfly or whatever it is The
shortness of life The shortness of life Ive only one night or
one day and theres this vast dangerous garden waiting out there
undiscovered unexplored

But if you feel like that why began Linda quickly

Ah cried Jonathan And that ah was somehow almost exultant
There you have me Why Why indeed Theres the maddening mysterious
question Why dont I fly out again Theres the window or the door or
whatever it was I came in by Its not hopelessly shutis it Why dont
I find it and be off Answer me that little sister But he gave her no
time to answer

Im exactly like that insect again For some reasonJonathan paused
between the wordsits not allowed its forbidden its against the
insect law to stop banging and flopping and crawling up the pane even
for an instant Why dont I leave the office Why dont I seriously
consider this moment for instance what it is that prevents me
leaving Its not as though Im tremendously tied Ive two boys to
provide for but after all theyre boys I could cut off to sea or
get a job upcountry or Suddenly he smiled at Linda and said in
a changed voice as if he were confiding a secret Weak weak No
stamina No anchor No guiding principle let us call it But then the
dark velvety voice rolled out

 Would ye hear the story
 How it unfolds itself 

and they were silent

The sun had set In the western sky there were great masses of
crushedup rosecoloured clouds Broad beams of light shone through the
clouds and beyond them as if they would cover the whole sky Overhead
the blue faded it turned a pale gold and the bush outlined against
it gleamed dark and brilliant like metal Sometimes when those beams of
light show in the sky they are very awful They remind you that up there
sits Jehovah the jealous God the Almighty Whose eye is upon you ever
watchful never weary You remember that at His coming the whole earth
will shake into one ruined graveyard the cold bright angels will drive
you this way and that and there will be no time to explain what could
be explained so simply But tonight it seemed to Linda there was
something infinitely joyful and loving in those silver beams And now
no sound came from the sea It breathed softly as if it would draw that
tender joyful beauty into its own bosom

Its all wrong its all wrong came the shadowy voice of Jonathan
Its not the scene its not the setting for three stools three
desks three inkpots and a wire blind

Linda knew that he would never change but she said Is it too late
even now

Im oldIm old intoned Jonathan He bent towards her he passed his
hand over his head Look His black hair was speckled all over with
silver like the breast plumage of a black fowl

Linda was surprised She had no idea that he was grey And yet as he
stood up beside her and sighed and stretched she saw him for the first
time not resolute not gallant not careless but touched already with
age He looked very tall on the darkening grass and the thought crossed
her mind He is like a weed

Jonathan stooped again and kissed her fingers

Heaven reward thy sweet patience lady mine he murmured I must go
seek those heirs to my fame and fortune  He was gone


Chapter 1XI

Light shone in the windows of the bungalow Two square patches of gold
fell upon the pinks and the peaked marigolds Florrie the cat came
out on to the veranda and sat on the top step her white paws close
together her tail curled round She looked content as though she had
been waiting for this moment all day

Thank goodness its getting late said Florrie Thank goodness the
long day is over Her greengage eyes opened

Presently there sounded the rumble of the coach the crack of Kellys
whip It came near enough for one to hear the voices of the men from
town talking loudly together It stopped at the Burnells gate

Stanley was halfway up the path before he saw Linda Is that you
darling

Yes Stanley

He leapt across the flowerbed and seized her in his arms She was
enfolded in that familiar eager strong embrace

Forgive me darling forgive me stammered Stanley and he put his
hand under her chin and lifted her face to him

Forgive you smiled Linda But whatever for

Good God You cant have forgotten cried Stanley Burnell Ive
thought of nothing else all day Ive had the hell of a day I made up
my mind to dash out and telegraph and then I thought the wire mightnt
reach you before I did Ive been in tortures Linda

But Stanley said Linda what must I forgive you for

LindaStanley was very hurtdidnt you realizeyou must have
realizedI went away without saying goodbye to you this morning I
cant imagine how I can have done such a thing My confounded temper of
course Butwelland he sighed and took her in his arms againIve
suffered for it enough today

Whats that youve got in your hand asked Linda New gloves Let me
see

Oh just a cheap pair of washleather ones said Stanley humbly I
noticed Bell was wearing some in the coach this morning so as I
was passing the shop I dashed in and got myself a pair What are you
smiling at You dont think it was wrong of me do you

On the contrary darling said Linda I think it was most sensible

She pulled one of the large pale gloves on her own fingers and looked
at her hand turning it this way and that She was still smiling

Stanley wanted to say I was thinking of you the whole time I bought
them It was true but for some reason he couldnt say it Lets go
in said he


Chapter 1XII

Why does one feel so different at night Why is it so exciting to be
awake when everybody else is asleep Lateit is very late And yet
every moment you feel more and more wakeful as though you were slowly
almost with every breath waking up into a new wonderful far more
thrilling and exciting world than the daylight one And what is this
queer sensation that youre a conspirator Lightly stealthily you move
about your room You take something off the dressingtable and put it
down again without a sound And everything even the bedpost knows
you responds shares your secret

Youre not very fond of your room by day You never think about it
Youre in and out the door opens and slams the cupboard creaks You
sit down on the side of your bed change your shoes and dash out again
A dive down to the glass two pins in your hair powder your nose and
off again But nowits suddenly dear to you Its a darling little
funny room Its yours Oh what a joy it is to own things Minemy
own

My very own for ever

Yes Their lips met

No of course that had nothing to do with it That was all nonsense
and rubbish But in spite of herself Beryl saw so plainly two people
standing in the middle of her room Her arms were round his neck he
held her And now he whispered My beauty my little beauty
She jumped off her bed ran over to the window and kneeled on the
windowseat with her elbows on the sill But the beautiful night the
garden every bush every leaf even the white palings even the stars
were conspirators too So bright was the moon that the flowers were
bright as by day the shadow of the nasturtiums exquisite lilylike
leaves and wideopen flowers lay across the silvery veranda The
manukatree bent by the southerly winds was like a bird on one leg
stretching out a wing

But when Beryl looked at the bush it seemed to her the bush was sad

We are dumb trees reaching up in the night imploring we know not
what said the sorrowful bush

It is true when you are by yourself and you think about life it is
always sad All that excitement and so on has a way of suddenly leaving
you and its as though in the silence somebody called your name and
you heard your name for the first time Beryl

Yes Im here Im Beryl Who wants me

Beryl

Let me come

It is lonely living by oneself Of course there are relations friends
heaps of them but thats not what she means She wants some one who
will find the Beryl they none of them know who will expect her to be
that Beryl always She wants a lover

Take me away from all these other people my love Let us go far away
Let us live our life all new all ours from the very beginning Let us
make our fire Let us sit down to eat together Let us have long talks
at night

And the thought was almost Save me my love Save me

 Oh go on Dont be a prude my dear You enjoy yourself while
youre young Thats my advice And a high rush of silly laughter
joined Mrs Harry Kembers loud indifferent neigh

You see its so frightfully difficult when youve nobody Youre so
at the mercy of things You cant just be rude And youve always this
horror of seeming inexperienced and stuffy like the other ninnies at the
Bay Andand its fascinating to know youve power over people Yes
that is fascinating

Oh why oh why doesnt he come soon

If I go on living here thought Beryl anything may happen to me

But how do you know he is coming at all mocked a small voice within
her

But Beryl dismissed it She couldnt be left Other people perhaps but
not she It wasnt possible to think that Beryl Fairfield never married
that lovely fascinating girl

Do you remember Beryl Fairfield

Remember her As if I could forget her It was one summer at the
Bay that I saw her She was standing on the beach in a blueno
pinkmuslin frock holding on a big creamno blackstraw hat But
its years ago now

Shes as lovely as ever more so if anything

Beryl smiled bit her lip and gazed over the garden As she gazed she
saw somebody a man leave the road step along the paddock beside their
palings as if he was coming straight towards her Her heart beat Who
was it Who could it be It couldnt be a burglar certainly not a
burglar for he was smoking and he strolled lightly Beryls heart
leapt it seemed to turn right over and then to stop She recognized
him

Good evening Miss Beryl said the voice softly

Good evening

Wont you come for a little walk it drawled

Come for a walkat that time of night I couldnt Everybodys in bed
Everybodys asleep

Oh said the voice lightly and a whiff of sweet smoke reached her
What does everybody matter Do come Its such a fine night Theres
not a soul about

Beryl shook her head But already something stirred in her something
reared its head

The voice said Frightened It mocked Poor little girl

Not in the least said she As she spoke that weak thing within her
seemed to uncoil to grow suddenly tremendously strong she longed to
go

And just as if this was quite understood by the other the voice said
gently and softly but finally Come along

Beryl stepped over her low window crossed the veranda ran down the
grass to the gate He was there before her

Thats right breathed the voice and it teased Youre not
frightened are you Youre not frightened

She was now she was here she was terrified and it seemed to her
everything was different The moonlight stared and glittered the
shadows were like bars of iron Her hand was taken

Not in the least she said lightly Why should I be

Her hand was pulled gently tugged She held back

No Im not coming any farther said Beryl

Oh rot Harry Kember didnt believe her Come along Well just go
as far as that fuchsia bush Come along

The fuchsia bush was tall It fell over the fence in a shower There was
a little pit of darkness beneath

No really I dont want to said Beryl

For a moment Harry Kember didnt answer Then he came close to her
turned to her smiled and said quickly Dont be silly Dont be
silly

His smile was something shed never seen before Was he drunk That
bright blind terrifying smile froze her with horror What was she
doing How had she got here the stern garden asked her as the gate
pushed open and quick as a cat Harry Kember came through and snatched
her to him

Cold little devil Cold little devil said the hateful voice

But Beryl was strong She slipped ducked wrenched free

You are vile vile said she

Then why in Gods name did you come stammered Harry Kember

Nobody answered him


Chapter 1XIII

A cloud small serene floated across the moon In that moment of
darkness the sea sounded deep troubled Then the cloud sailed away
and the sound of the sea was a vague murmur as though it waked out of a
dark dream All was still




2 THE GARDEN PARTY

And after all the weather was ideal They could not have had a more
perfect day for a gardenparty if they had ordered it Windless warm
the sky without a cloud Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light
gold as it is sometimes in early summer The gardener had been up since
dawn mowing the lawns and sweeping them until the grass and the dark
flat rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine As for
the roses you could not help feeling they understood that roses are
the only flowers that impress people at gardenparties the only flowers
that everybody is certain of knowing Hundreds yes literally hundreds
had come out in a single night the green bushes bowed down as though
they had been visited by archangels

Breakfast was not yet over before the men came to put up the marquee

Where do you want the marquee put mother

My dear child its no use asking me Im determined to leave
everything to you children this year Forget I am your mother Treat me
as an honoured guest

But Meg could not possibly go and supervise the men She had washed
her hair before breakfast and she sat drinking her coffee in a green
turban with a dark wet curl stamped on each cheek Jose the butterfly
always came down in a silk petticoat and a kimono jacket

Youll have to go Laura youre the artistic one

Away Laura flew still holding her piece of breadandbutter Its so
delicious to have an excuse for eating out of doors and besides she
loved having to arrange things she always felt she could do it so much
better than anybody else

Four men in their shirtsleeves stood grouped together on the garden
path They carried staves covered with rolls of canvas and they had big
toolbags slung on their backs They looked impressive Laura wished now
that she had not got the breadandbutter but there was nowhere to put
it and she couldnt possibly throw it away She blushed and tried to
look severe and even a little bit shortsighted as she came up to them

Good morning she said copying her mothers voice But that sounded
so fearfully affected that she was ashamed and stammered like a little
girl Oherhave you comeis it about the marquee

Thats right miss said the tallest of the men a lanky freckled
fellow and he shifted his toolbag knocked back his straw hat and
smiled down at her Thats about it

His smile was so easy so friendly that Laura recovered What nice eyes
he had small but such a dark blue And now she looked at the others
they were smiling too Cheer up we wont bite their smile seemed
to say How very nice workmen were And what a beautiful morning She
mustnt mention the morning she must be businesslike The marquee

Well what about the lilylawn Would that do

And she pointed to the lilylawn with the hand that didnt hold the
breadandbutter They turned they stared in the direction A little
fat chap thrust out his underlip and the tall fellow frowned

I dont fancy it said he Not conspicuous enough You see with a
thing like a marquee and he turned to Laura in his easy way you want
to put it somewhere where itll give you a bang slap in the eye if you
follow me

Lauras upbringing made her wonder for a moment whether it was quite
respectful of a workman to talk to her of bangs slap in the eye But she
did quite follow him

A corner of the tenniscourt she suggested But the bands going to
be in one corner

Hm going to have a band are you said another of the workmen
He was pale He had a haggard look as his dark eyes scanned the
tenniscourt What was he thinking

Only a very small band said Laura gently Perhaps he wouldnt mind so
much if the band was quite small But the tall fellow interrupted

Look here miss thats the place Against those trees Over there
Thatll do fine

Against the karakas Then the karakatrees would be hidden And they
were so lovely with their broad gleaming leaves and their clusters
of yellow fruit They were like trees you imagined growing on a desert
island proud solitary lifting their leaves and fruits to the sun in a
kind of silent splendour Must they be hidden by a marquee

They must Already the men had shouldered their staves and were making
for the place Only the tall fellow was left He bent down pinched a
sprig of lavender put his thumb and forefinger to his nose and snuffed
up the smell When Laura saw that gesture she forgot all about the
karakas in her wonder at him caring for things like thatcaring for
the smell of lavender How many men that she knew would have done such
a thing Oh how extraordinarily nice workmen were she thought Why
couldnt she have workmen for her friends rather than the silly boys she
danced with and who came to Sunday night supper She would get on much
better with men like these

Its all the fault she decided as the tall fellow drew something on
the back of an envelope something that was to be looped up or left to
hang of these absurd class distinctions Well for her part she didnt
feel them Not a bit not an atom And now there came the chockchock
of wooden hammers Some one whistled some one sang out Are you right
there matey Matey The friendliness of it thetheJust to prove
how happy she was just to show the tall fellow how at home she felt
and how she despised stupid conventions Laura took a big bite of her
breadandbutter as she stared at the little drawing She felt just like
a workgirl

Laura Laura where are you Telephone Laura a voice cried from the
house

Coming Away she skimmed over the lawn up the path up the steps
across the veranda and into the porch In the hall her father and
Laurie were brushing their hats ready to go to the office

I say Laura said Laurie very fast you might just give a squiz at
my coat before this afternoon See if it wants pressing

I will said she Suddenly she couldnt stop herself She ran at
Laurie and gave him a small quick squeeze Oh I do love parties
dont you gasped Laura

Rather said Lauries warm boyish voice and he squeezed his sister
too and gave her a gentle push Dash off to the telephone old girl

The telephone Yes yes oh yes Kitty Good morning dear Come to
lunch Do dear Delighted of course It will only be a very scratch
mealjust the sandwich crusts and broken meringueshells and whats
left over Yes isnt it a perfect morning Your white Oh I certainly
should One momenthold the line Mothers calling And Laura sat
back What mother Cant hear

Mrs Sheridans voice floated down the stairs Tell her to wear that
sweet hat she had on last Sunday

Mother says youre to wear that sweet hat you had on last Sunday Good
One oclock Byebye

Laura put back the receiver flung her arms over her head took a deep
breath stretched and let them fall Huh she sighed and the moment
after the sigh she sat up quickly She was still listening All the
doors in the house seemed to be open The house was alive with soft
quick steps and running voices The green baize door that led to the
kitchen regions swung open and shut with a muffled thud And now there
came a long chuckling absurd sound It was the heavy piano being moved
on its stiff castors But the air If you stopped to notice was the air
always like this Little faint winds were playing chase in at the tops
of the windows out at the doors And there were two tiny spots of
sun one on the inkpot one on a silver photograph frame playing too
Darling little spots Especially the one on the inkpot lid It was quite
warm A warm little silver star She could have kissed it

The front door bell pealed and there sounded the rustle of Sadies
print skirt on the stairs A mans voice murmured Sadie answered
careless Im sure I dont know Wait Ill ask Mrs Sheridan

What is it Sadie Laura came into the hall

Its the florist Miss Laura

It was indeed There just inside the door stood a wide shallow tray
full of pots of pink lilies No other kind Nothing but liliescanna
lilies big pink flowers wide open radiant almost frighteningly alive
on bright crimson stems

Ooh Sadie said Laura and the sound was like a little moan She
crouched down as if to warm herself at that blaze of lilies she felt
they were in her fingers on her lips growing in her breast

Its some mistake she said faintly Nobody ever ordered so many
Sadie go and find mother

But at that moment Mrs Sheridan joined them

Its quite right she said calmly Yes I ordered them Arent they
lovely She pressed Lauras arm I was passing the shop yesterday and
I saw them in the window And I suddenly thought for once in my life I
shall have enough canna lilies The gardenparty will be a good excuse

But I thought you said you didnt mean to interfere said Laura Sadie
had gone The florists man was still outside at his van She put
her arm round her mothers neck and gently very gently she bit her
mothers ear

My darling child you wouldnt like a logical mother would you Dont
do that Heres the man

He carried more lilies still another whole tray

Bank them up just inside the door on both sides of the porch
please said Mrs Sheridan Dont you agree Laura

Oh I do mother

In the drawingroom Meg Jose and good little Hans had at last succeeded
in moving the piano

Now if we put this chesterfield against the wall and move everything
out of the room except the chairs dont you think

Quite

Hans move these tables into the smokingroom and bring a sweeper
to take these marks off the carpet andone moment Hans Jose loved
giving orders to the servants and they loved obeying her She always
made them feel they were taking part in some drama Tell mother and
Miss Laura to come here at once

Very good Miss Jose

She turned to Meg I want to hear what the piano sounds like just
in case Im asked to sing this afternoon Lets try over This life is
Weary

Pom Tatata Teeta The piano burst out so passionately that
Joses face changed She clasped her hands She looked mournfully and
enigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in

 This Life is Weeary
 A Teara Sigh
 A Love that Changes
 This Life is Weeary
 A Teara Sigh
 A Love that Changes
 And then Goodbye

But at the word Goodbye and although the piano sounded more
desperate than ever her face broke into a brilliant dreadfully
unsympathetic smile

Arent I in good voice mummy she beamed

 This Life is Weeary
 Hope comes to Die
 A Dreama Wakening

But now Sadie interrupted them What is it Sadie

If you please mm cook says have you got the flags for the
sandwiches

The flags for the sandwiches Sadie echoed Mrs Sheridan dreamily
And the children knew by her face that she hadnt got them Let me
see And she said to Sadie firmly Tell cook Ill let her have them in
ten minutes

Sadie went

Now Laura said her mother quickly come with me into the
smokingroom Ive got the names somewhere on the back of an envelope
Youll have to write them out for me Meg go upstairs this minute and
take that wet thing off your head Jose run and finish dressing this
instant Do you hear me children or shall I have to tell your father
when he comes home tonight Andand Jose pacify cook if you do go
into the kitchen will you Im terrified of her this morning

The envelope was found at last behind the diningroom clock though how
it had got there Mrs Sheridan could not imagine

One of you children must have stolen it out of my bag because I
remember vividlycream cheese and lemoncurd Have you done that

Yes

Egg and Mrs Sheridan held the envelope away from her It looks
like mice It cant be mice can it

Olive pet said Laura looking over her shoulder

Yes of course olive What a horrible combination it sounds Egg and
olive

They were finished at last and Laura took them off to the kitchen She
found Jose there pacifying the cook who did not look at all terrifying

I have never seen such exquisite sandwiches said Joses rapturous
voice How many kinds did you say there were cook Fifteen

Fifteen Miss Jose

Well cook I congratulate you

Cook swept up crusts with the long sandwich knife and smiled broadly

Godbers has come announced Sadie issuing out of the pantry She had
seen the man pass the window

That meant the cream puffs had come Godbers were famous for their
cream puffs Nobody ever thought of making them at home

Bring them in and put them on the table my girl ordered cook

Sadie brought them in and went back to the door Of course Laura and
Jose were far too grownup to really care about such things All the
same they couldnt help agreeing that the puffs looked very attractive
Very Cook began arranging them shaking off the extra icing sugar

Dont they carry one back to all ones parties said Laura

I suppose they do said practical Jose who never liked to be carried
back They look beautifully light and feathery I must say

Have one each my dears said cook in her comfortable voice Yer ma
wont know

Oh impossible Fancy cream puffs so soon after breakfast The very idea
made one shudder All the same two minutes later Jose and Laura were
licking their fingers with that absorbed inward look that only comes
from whipped cream

Lets go into the garden out by the back way suggested Laura I
want to see how the men are getting on with the marquee Theyre such
awfully nice men

But the back door was blocked by cook Sadie Godbers man and Hans

Something had happened

Tuktuktuk clucked cook like an agitated hen Sadie had her hand
clapped to her cheek as though she had toothache Hanss face was
screwed up in the effort to understand Only Godbers man seemed to be
enjoying himself it was his story

Whats the matter Whats happened

Theres been a horrible accident said Cook A man killed

A man killed Where How When

But Godbers man wasnt going to have his story snatched from under his
very nose

Know those little cottages just below here miss Know them Of
course she knew them Well theres a young chap living there name of
Scott a carter His horse shied at a tractionengine corner of Hawke
Street this morning and he was thrown out on the back of his head
Killed

Dead Laura stared at Godbers man

Dead when they picked him up said Godbers man with relish They
were taking the body home as I come up here And he said to the cook
Hes left a wife and five little ones

Jose come here Laura caught hold of her sisters sleeve and dragged
her through the kitchen to the other side of the green baize door There
she paused and leaned against it Jose she said horrified however
are we going to stop everything

Stop everything Laura cried Jose in astonishment What do you
mean

Stop the gardenparty of course Why did Jose pretend

But Jose was still more amazed Stop the gardenparty My dear Laura
dont be so absurd Of course we cant do anything of the kind Nobody
expects us to Dont be so extravagant

But we cant possibly have a gardenparty with a man dead just outside
the front gate

That really was extravagant for the little cottages were in a lane to
themselves at the very bottom of a steep rise that led up to the house
A broad road ran between True they were far too near They were
the greatest possible eyesore and they had no right to be in that
neighbourhood at all They were little mean dwellings painted a
chocolate brown In the garden patches there was nothing but cabbage
stalks sick hens and tomato cans The very smoke coming out of their
chimneys was povertystricken Little rags and shreds of smoke so
unlike the great silvery plumes that uncurled from the Sheridans
chimneys Washerwomen lived in the lane and sweeps and a cobbler and
a man whose housefront was studded all over with minute birdcages
Children swarmed When the Sheridans were little they were forbidden to
set foot there because of the revolting language and of what they might
catch But since they were grown up Laura and Laurie on their prowls
sometimes walked through It was disgusting and sordid They came
out with a shudder But still one must go everywhere one must see
everything So through they went

And just think of what the band would sound like to that poor woman
said Laura

Oh Laura Jose began to be seriously annoyed If youre going to
stop a band playing every time some one has an accident youll lead a
very strenuous life Im every bit as sorry about it as you I feel just
as sympathetic Her eyes hardened She looked at her sister just as she
used to when they were little and fighting together You wont bring a
drunken workman back to life by being sentimental she said softly

Drunk Who said he was drunk Laura turned furiously on Jose She
said just as they had used to say on those occasions Im going
straight up to tell mother

Do dear cooed Jose

Mother can I come into your room Laura turned the big glass
doorknob

Of course child Why whats the matter Whats given you such a
colour And Mrs Sheridan turned round from her dressingtable She was
trying on a new hat

Mother a mans been killed began Laura

Not in the garden interrupted her mother

No no

Oh what a fright you gave me Mrs Sheridan sighed with relief and
took off the big hat and held it on her knees

But listen mother said Laura Breathless halfchoking she told
the dreadful story Of course we cant have our party can we she
pleaded The band and everybody arriving Theyd hear us mother
theyre nearly neighbours

To Lauras astonishment her mother behaved just like Jose it was harder
to bear because she seemed amused She refused to take Laura seriously

But my dear child use your common sense Its only by accident weve
heard of it If some one had died there normallyand I cant understand
how they keep alive in those poky little holeswe should still be
having our party shouldnt we

Laura had to say yes to that but she felt it was all wrong She sat
down on her mothers sofa and pinched the cushion frill

Mother isnt it terribly heartless of us she asked

Darling Mrs Sheridan got up and came over to her carrying the hat
Before Laura could stop her she had popped it on My child said her
mother the hat is yours Its made for you Its much too young for
me I have never seen you look such a picture Look at yourself And
she held up her handmirror

But mother Laura began again She couldnt look at herself she
turned aside

This time Mrs Sheridan lost patience just as Jose had done

You are being very absurd Laura she said coldly People like that
dont expect sacrifices from us And its not very sympathetic to spoil
everybodys enjoyment as youre doing now

I dont understand said Laura and she walked quickly out of the room
into her own bedroom There quite by chance the first thing she saw
was this charming girl in the mirror in her black hat trimmed with
gold daisies and a long black velvet ribbon Never had she imagined she
could look like that Is mother right she thought And now she
hoped her mother was right Am I being extravagant Perhaps it was
extravagant Just for a moment she had another glimpse of that poor
woman and those little children and the body being carried into
the house But it all seemed blurred unreal like a picture in the
newspaper Ill remember it again after the partys over she decided
And somehow that seemed quite the best plan

Lunch was over by halfpast one By halfpast two they were all ready
for the fray The greencoated band had arrived and was established in a
corner of the tenniscourt

My dear trilled Kitty Maitland arent they too like frogs for
words You ought to have arranged them round the pond with the conductor
in the middle on a leaf

Laurie arrived and hailed them on his way to dress At the sight of him
Laura remembered the accident again She wanted to tell him If Laurie
agreed with the others then it was bound to be all right And she
followed him into the hall

Laurie

Hallo He was halfway upstairs but when he turned round and saw
Laura he suddenly puffed out his cheeks and goggled his eyes at her
My word Laura You do look stunning said Laurie What an absolutely
topping hat

Laura said faintly Is it and smiled up at Laurie and didnt tell him
after all

Soon after that people began coming in streams The band struck up the
hired waiters ran from the house to the marquee Wherever you looked
there were couples strolling bending to the flowers greeting moving
on over the lawn They were like bright birds that had alighted in the
Sheridans garden for this one afternoon on their way towhere Ah
what happiness it is to be with people who all are happy to press
hands press cheeks smile into eyes

Darling Laura how well you look

What a becoming hat child

Laura you look quite Spanish Ive never seen you look so striking

And Laura glowing answered softly Have you had tea Wont you have
an ice The passionfruit ices really are rather special She ran to
her father and begged him Daddy darling cant the band have something
to drink

And the perfect afternoon slowly ripened slowly faded slowly its
petals closed

Never a more delightful gardenparty  The greatest success 
Quite the most 

Laura helped her mother with the goodbyes They stood side by side in
the porch till it was all over

All over all over thank heaven said Mrs Sheridan Round up the
others Laura Lets go and have some fresh coffee Im exhausted Yes
its been very successful But oh these parties these parties Why
will you children insist on giving parties And they all of them sat
down in the deserted marquee

Have a sandwich daddy dear I wrote the flag

Thanks Mr Sheridan took a bite and the sandwich was gone He took
another I suppose you didnt hear of a beastly accident that happened
today he said

My dear said Mrs Sheridan holding up her hand we did It nearly
ruined the party Laura insisted we should put it off

Oh mother Laura didnt want to be teased about it

It was a horrible affair all the same said Mr Sheridan The chap
was married too Lived just below in the lane and leaves a wife and
half a dozen kiddies so they say

An awkward little silence fell Mrs Sheridan fidgeted with her cup
Really it was very tactless of father

Suddenly she looked up There on the table were all those sandwiches
cakes puffs all uneaten all going to be wasted She had one of her
brilliant ideas

I know she said Lets make up a basket Lets send that poor
creature some of this perfectly good food At any rate it will be the
greatest treat for the children Dont you agree And shes sure to
have neighbours calling in and so on What a point to have it all ready
prepared Laura She jumped up Get me the big basket out of the
stairs cupboard

But mother do you really think its a good idea said Laura

Again how curious she seemed to be different from them all To take
scraps from their party Would the poor woman really like that

Of course Whats the matter with you today An hour or two ago you
were insisting on us being sympathetic and now

Oh well Laura ran for the basket It was filled it was heaped by her
mother

Take it yourself darling said she Run down just as you are No
wait take the arum lilies too People of that class are so impressed by
arum lilies

The stems will ruin her lace frock said practical Jose

So they would Just in time Only the basket then And Lauraher
mother followed her out of the marqueedont on any account

What mother

No better not put such ideas into the childs head Nothing Run
along

It was just growing dusky as Laura shut their garden gates A big dog
ran by like a shadow The road gleamed white and down below in the
hollow the little cottages were in deep shade How quiet it seemed after
the afternoon Here she was going down the hill to somewhere where a man
lay dead and she couldnt realize it Why couldnt she She stopped
a minute And it seemed to her that kisses voices tinkling spoons
laughter the smell of crushed grass were somehow inside her She had no
room for anything else How strange She looked up at the pale sky and
all she thought was Yes it was the most successful party

Now the broad road was crossed The lane began smoky and dark Women in
shawls and mens tweed caps hurried by Men hung over the palings the
children played in the doorways A low hum came from the mean little
cottages In some of them there was a flicker of light and a shadow
crablike moved across the window Laura bent her head and hurried on
She wished now she had put on a coat How her frock shone And the
big hat with the velvet streamerif only it was another hat Were the
people looking at her They must be It was a mistake to have come she
knew all along it was a mistake Should she go back even now

No too late This was the house It must be A dark knot of people
stood outside Beside the gate an old old woman with a crutch sat in a
chair watching She had her feet on a newspaper The voices stopped as
Laura drew near The group parted It was as though she was expected as
though they had known she was coming here

Laura was terribly nervous Tossing the velvet ribbon over her shoulder
she said to a woman standing by Is this Mrs Scotts house and the
woman smiling queerly said It is my lass

Oh to be away from this She actually said Help me God as she
walked up the tiny path and knocked To be away from those staring eyes
or to be covered up in anything one of those womens shawls even Ill
just leave the basket and go she decided I shant even wait for it to
be emptied

Then the door opened A little woman in black showed in the gloom

Laura said Are you Mrs Scott But to her horror the woman answered
Walk in please miss and she was shut in the passage

No said Laura I dont want to come in I only want to leave this
basket Mother sent

The little woman in the gloomy passage seemed not to have heard her
Step this way please miss she said in an oily voice and Laura
followed her

She found herself in a wretched little low kitchen lighted by a smoky
lamp There was a woman sitting before the fire

Em said the little creature who had let her in Em Its a young
lady She turned to Laura She said meaningly Im er sister miss
Youll excuse er wont you

Oh but of course said Laura Please please dont disturb her II
only want to leave

But at that moment the woman at the fire turned round Her face puffed
up red with swollen eyes and swollen lips looked terrible She seemed
as though she couldnt understand why Laura was there What did it mean
Why was this stranger standing in the kitchen with a basket What was it
all about And the poor face puckered up again

All right my dear said the other Ill thenk the young lady

And again she began Youll excuse her miss Im sure and her face
swollen too tried an oily smile

Laura only wanted to get out to get away She was back in the passage
The door opened She walked straight through into the bedroom where the
dead man was lying

Youd like a look at im wouldnt you said Ems sister and she
brushed past Laura over to the bed Dont be afraid my lassand now
her voice sounded fond and sly and fondly she drew down the sheete
looks a picture Theres nothing to show Come along my dear

Laura came

There lay a young man fast asleepsleeping so soundly so deeply that
he was far far away from them both Oh so remote so peaceful He was
dreaming Never wake him up again His head was sunk in the pillow his
eyes were closed they were blind under the closed eyelids He was given
up to his dream What did gardenparties and baskets and lace frocks
matter to him He was far from all those things He was wonderful
beautiful While they were laughing and while the band was playing
this marvel had come to the lane Happy happy All is well said that
sleeping face This is just as it should be I am content

But all the same you had to cry and she couldnt go out of the room
without saying something to him Laura gave a loud childish sob

Forgive my hat she said

And this time she didnt wait for Ems sister She found her way out of
the door down the path past all those dark people At the corner of
the lane she met Laurie

He stepped out of the shadow Is that you Laura

Yes

Mother was getting anxious Was it all right

Yes quite Oh Laurie She took his arm she pressed up against him

I say youre not crying are you asked her brother

Laura shook her head She was

Laurie put his arm round her shoulder Dont cry he said in his warm
loving voice Was it awful

No sobbed Laura It was simply marvellous But Laurie She
stopped she looked at her brother Isnt life she stammered isnt
life But what life was she couldnt explain No matter He quite
understood

Isnt it darling said Laurie




3 THE DAUGHTERS OF THE LATE COLONEL

Chapter 3I

The week after was one of the busiest weeks of their lives Even when
they went to bed it was only their bodies that lay down and rested
their minds went on thinking things out talking things over
wondering deciding trying to remember where

Constantia lay like a statue her hands by her sides her feet just
overlapping each other the sheet up to her chin She stared at the
ceiling

Do you think father would mind if we gave his tophat to the porter

The porter snapped Josephine Why ever the porter What a very
extraordinary idea

Because said Constantia slowly he must often have to go to
funerals And I noticed atat the cemetery that he only had a bowler
She paused I thought then how very much hed appreciate a tophat We
ought to give him a present too He was always very nice to father

But cried Josephine flouncing on her pillow and staring across the
dark at Constantia fathers head And suddenly for one awful moment
she nearly giggled Not of course that she felt in the least like
giggling It must have been habit Years ago when they had stayed awake
at night talking their beds had simply heaved And now the porters
head disappearing popped out like a candle under fathers hat The
giggle mounted mounted she clenched her hands she fought it down she
frowned fiercely at the dark and said Remember terribly sternly

We can decide tomorrow she said

Constantia had noticed nothing she sighed

Do you think we ought to have our dressinggowns dyed as well

Black almost shrieked Josephine

Well what else said Constantia I was thinkingit doesnt seem
quite sincere in a way to wear black out of doors and when were fully
dressed and then when were at home

But nobody sees us said Josephine She gave the bedclothes such a
twitch that both her feet became uncovered and she had to creep up the
pillows to get them well under again

Kate does said Constantia And the postman very well might

Josephine thought of her darkred slippers which matched her
dressinggown and of Constantias favourite indefinite green ones which
went with hers Black Two black dressinggowns and two pairs of black
woolly slippers creeping off to the bathroom like black cats

I dont think its absolutely necessary said she

Silence Then Constantia said We shall have to post the papers with
the notice in them tomorrow to catch the Ceylon mail How many letters
have we had up till now

Twentythree

Josephine had replied to them all and twentythree times when she came
to We miss our dear father so much she had broken down and had to use
her handkerchief and on some of them even to soak up a very lightblue
tear with an edge of blottingpaper Strange She couldnt have put
it onbut twentythree times Even now though when she said over to
herself sadly We miss our dear father so much she could have cried if
shed wanted to

Have you got enough stamps came from Constantia

Oh how can I tell said Josephine crossly Whats the good of asking
me that now

I was just wondering said Constantia mildly

Silence again There came a little rustle a scurry a hop

A mouse said Constantia

It cant be a mouse because there arent any crumbs said Josephine

But it doesnt know there arent said Constantia

A spasm of pity squeezed her heart Poor little thing She wished shed
left a tiny piece of biscuit on the dressingtable It was awful to
think of it not finding anything What would it do

I cant think how they manage to live at all she said slowly

Who demanded Josephine

And Constantia said more loudly than she meant to Mice

Josephine was furious Oh what nonsense Con she said What have
mice got to do with it Youre asleep

I dont think I am said Constantia She shut her eyes to make sure
She was

Josephine arched her spine pulled up her knees folded her arms so that
her fists came under her ears and pressed her cheek hard against the
pillow


Chapter 3II

Another thing which complicated matters was they had Nurse Andrews
staying on with them that week It was their own fault they had asked
her It was Josephines idea On the morningwell on the last morning
when the doctor had gone Josephine had said to Constantia Dont you
think it would be rather nice if we asked Nurse Andrews to stay on for a
week as our guest

Very nice said Constantia

I thought went on Josephine quickly I should just say this
afternoon after Ive paid her My sister and I would be very pleased
after all youve done for us Nurse Andrews if you would stay on for
a week as our guest Id have to put that in about being our guest in
case

Oh but she could hardly expect to be paid cried Constantia

One never knows said Josephine sagely

Nurse Andrews had of course jumped at the idea But it was a bother
It meant they had to have regular sitdown meals at the proper times
whereas if theyd been alone they could just have asked Kate if she
wouldnt have minded bringing them a tray wherever they were And
mealtimes now that the strain was over were rather a trial

Nurse Andrews was simply fearful about butter Really they couldnt
help feeling that about butter at least she took advantage of their
kindness And she had that maddening habit of asking for just an inch
more of bread to finish what she had on her plate and then at the last
mouthful absentmindedlyof course it wasnt absentmindedlytaking
another helping Josephine got very red when this happened and she
fastened her small beadlike eyes on the tablecloth as if she saw a
minute strange insect creeping through the web of it But Constantias
long pale face lengthened and set and she gazed awayawayfar
over the desert to where that line of camels unwound like a thread of
wool

When I was with Lady Tukes said Nurse Andrews she had such a dainty
little contrayvance for the buttah It was a silvah Cupid balanced on
theon the bordah of a glass dish holding a tayny fork And when you
wanted some buttah you simply pressed his foot and he bent down and
speared you a piece It was quite a gayme

Josephine could hardly bear that But I think those things are very
extravagant was all she said

But whey asked Nurse Andrews beaming through her eyeglasses No
one surely would take more buttah than one wantedwould one

Ring Con cried Josephine She couldnt trust herself to reply

And proud young Kate the enchanted princess came in to see what the
old tabbies wanted now She snatched away their plates of mock something
or other and slapped down a white terrified blancmange

Jam please Kate said Josephine kindly

Kate knelt and burst open the sideboard lifted the lid of the jampot
saw it was empty put it on the table and stalked off

Im afraid said Nurse Andrews a moment later there isnt any

Oh what a bother said Josephine She bit her lip What had we
better do

Constantia looked dubious We cant disturb Kate again she said
softly

Nurse Andrews waited smiling at them both Her eyes wandered spying at
everything behind her eyeglasses Constantia in despair went back to her
camels Josephine frowned heavilyconcentrated If it hadnt been
for this idiotic woman she and Con would of course have eaten their
blancmange without Suddenly the idea came

I know she said Marmalade Theres some marmalade in the sideboard
Get it Con

I hope laughed Nurse Andrewsand her laugh was like a spoon tinkling
against a medicineglassI hope its not very bittah marmalayde


Chapter 3III

But after all it was not long now and then shed be gone for good
And there was no getting over the fact that she had been very kind
to father She had nursed him day and night at the end Indeed both
Constantia and Josephine felt privately she had rather overdone the not
leaving him at the very last For when they had gone in to say goodbye
Nurse Andrews had sat beside his bed the whole time holding his wrist
and pretending to look at her watch It couldnt have been necessary
It was so tactless too Supposing father had wanted to say
somethingsomething private to them Not that he had Oh far from it
He lay there purple a dark angry purple in the face and never even
looked at them when they came in Then as they were standing there
wondering what to do he had suddenly opened one eye Oh what a
difference it would have made what a difference to their memory of him
how much easier to tell people about it if he had only opened both But
noone eye only It glared at them a moment and then went out


Chapter 3IV

It had made it very awkward for them when Mr Farolles of St Johns
called the same afternoon

The end was quite peaceful I trust were the first words he said as
he glided towards them through the dark drawingroom

Quite said Josephine faintly They both hung their heads Both of
them felt certain that eye wasnt at all a peaceful eye

Wont you sit down said Josephine

Thank you Miss Pinner said Mr Farolles gratefully He folded his
coattails and began to lower himself into fathers armchair but
just as he touched it he almost sprang up and slid into the next chair
instead

He coughed Josephine clasped her hands Constantia looked vague

I want you to feel Miss Pinner said Mr Farolles and you Miss
Constantia that Im trying to be helpful I want to be helpful to you
both if you will let me These are the times said Mr Farolles very
simply and earnestly when God means us to be helpful to one another

Thank you very much Mr Farolles said Josephine and Constantia

Not at all said Mr Farolles gently He drew his kid gloves through
his fingers and leaned forward And if either of you would like a
little Communion either or both of you here and now you have only
to tell me A little Communion is often very helpa great comfort he
added tenderly

But the idea of a little Communion terrified them What In the
drawingroom by themselveswith nono altar or anything The piano
would be much too high thought Constantia and Mr Farolles could not
possibly lean over it with the chalice And Kate would be sure to come
bursting in and interrupt them thought Josephine And supposing the
bell rang in the middle It might be somebody importantabout their
mourning Would they get up reverently and go out or would they have to
wait in torture

Perhaps you will send round a note by your good Kate if you would care
for it later said Mr Farolles

Oh yes thank you very much they both said

Mr Farolles got up and took his black straw hat from the round table

And about the funeral he said softly I may arrange thatas your
dear fathers old friend and yours Miss Pinnerand Miss Constantia

Josephine and Constantia got up too

I should like it to be quite simple said Josephine firmly and not
too expensive At the same time I should like

A good one that will last thought dreamy Constantia as if Josephine
were buying a nightgown But of course Josephine didnt say that One
suitable to our fathers position She was very nervous

Ill run round to our good friend Mr Knight said Mr Farolles
soothingly I will ask him to come and see you I am sure you will find
him very helpful indeed


Chapter 3V

Well at any rate all that part of it was over though neither of them
could possibly believe that father was never coming back Josephine had
had a moment of absolute terror at the cemetery while the coffin was
lowered to think that she and Constantia had done this thing without
asking his permission What would father say when he found out For he
was bound to find out sooner or later He always did Buried You two
girls had me buried She heard his stick thumping Oh what would
they say What possible excuse could they make It sounded such an
appallingly heartless thing to do Such a wicked advantage to take of
a person because he happened to be helpless at the moment The
other people seemed to treat it all as a matter of course They were
strangers they couldnt be expected to understand that father was the
very last person for such a thing to happen to No the entire blame for
it all would fall on her and Constantia And the expense she thought
stepping into the tightbuttoned cab When she had to show him the
bills What would he say then

She heard him absolutely roaring And do you expect me to pay for this
gimcrack excursion of yours

Oh groaned poor Josephine aloud we shouldnt have done it Con

And Constantia pale as a lemon in all that blackness said in a
frightened whisper Done what Jug

Let them bubury father like that said Josephine breaking down and
crying into her new queersmelling mourning handkerchief

But what else could we have done asked Constantia wonderingly We
couldnt have kept him Jugwe couldnt have kept him unburied At any
rate not in a flat that size

Josephine blew her nose the cab was dreadfully stuffy

I dont know she said forlornly It is all so dreadful I feel we
ought to have tried to just for a time at least To make perfectly
sure One things certainand her tears sprang out againfather will
never forgive us for thisnever


Chapter 3VI

Father would never forgive them That was what they felt more than ever
when two mornings later they went into his room to go through
his things They had discussed it quite calmly It was even down on
Josephines list of things to be done Go through fathers things and
settle about them But that was a very different matter from saying
after breakfast

Well are you ready Con

Yes Jugwhen you are

Then I think wed better get it over

It was dark in the hall It had been a rule for years never to disturb
father in the morning whatever happened And now they were going to
open the door without knocking even Constantias eyes were enormous at
the idea Josephine felt weak in the knees

Youyou go first she gasped pushing Constantia

But Constantia said as she always had said on those occasions No
Jug thats not fair Youre the eldest

Josephine was just going to saywhat at other times she wouldnt have
owned to for the worldwhat she kept for her very last weapon But
youre the tallest when they noticed that the kitchen door was open
and there stood Kate

Very stiff said Josephine grasping the doorhandle and doing her best
to turn it As if anything ever deceived Kate

It couldnt be helped That girl was Then the door was shut behind
them butbut they werent in fathers room at all They might have
suddenly walked through the wall by mistake into a different flat
altogether Was the door just behind them They were too frightened to
look Josephine knew that if it was it was holding itself tight shut
Constantia felt that like the doors in dreams it hadnt any handle
at all It was the coldness which made it so awful Or the
whitenesswhich Everything was covered The blinds were down a cloth
hung over the mirror a sheet hid the bed a huge fan of white paper
filled the fireplace Constantia timidly put out her hand she almost
expected a snowflake to fall Josephine felt a queer tingling in her
nose as if her nose was freezing Then a cab klopklopped over the
cobbles below and the quiet seemed to shake into little pieces

I had better pull up a blind said Josephine bravely

Yes it might be a good idea whispered Constantia

They only gave the blind a touch but it flew up and the cord flew
after rolling round the blindstick and the little tassel tapped as if
trying to get free That was too much for Constantia

Dont you thinkdont you think we might put it off for another day
she whispered

Why snapped Josephine feeling as usual much better now that she
knew for certain that Constantia was terrified Its got to be done
But I do wish you wouldnt whisper Con

I didnt know I was whispering whispered Constantia

And why do you keep staring at the bed said Josephine raising her
voice almost defiantly Theres nothing on the bed

Oh Jug dont say so said poor Connie At any rate not so loudly

Josephine felt herself that she had gone too far She took a wide swerve
over to the chest of drawers put out her hand but quickly drew it back
again

Connie she gasped and she wheeled round and leaned with her back
against the chest of drawers

Oh Jugwhat

Josephine could only glare She had the most extraordinary feeling that
she had just escaped something simply awful But how could she explain
to Constantia that father was in the chest of drawers He was in the
top drawer with his handkerchiefs and neckties or in the next with
his shirts and pyjamas or in the lowest of all with his suits He
was watching there hidden awayjust behind the doorhandleready to
spring

She pulled a funny oldfashioned face at Constantia just as she used to
in the old days when she was going to cry

I cant open she nearly wailed

No dont Jug whispered Constantia earnestly Its much better not
to Dont lets open anything At any rate not for a long time

Butbut it seems so weak said Josephine breaking down

But why not be weak for once Jug argued Constantia whispering
quite fiercely If it is weak And her pale stare flew from the locked
writingtableso safeto the huge glittering wardrobe and she began
to breathe in a queer panting away Why shouldnt we be weak for once
in our lives Jug Its quite excusable Lets be weakbe weak Jug
Its much nicer to be weak than to be strong

And then she did one of those amazingly bold things that shed done
about twice before in their lives she marched over to the wardrobe
turned the key and took it out of the lock Took it out of the lock and
held it up to Josephine showing Josephine by her extraordinary smile
that she knew what shed doneshed risked deliberately father being in
there among his overcoats

If the huge wardrobe had lurched forward had crashed down on
Constantia Josephine wouldnt have been surprised On the contrary
she would have thought it the only suitable thing to happen But nothing
happened Only the room seemed quieter than ever and the bigger flakes
of cold air fell on Josephines shoulders and knees She began to
shiver

Come Jug said Constantia still with that awful callous smile and
Josephine followed just as she had that last time when Constantia had
pushed Benny into the round pond


Chapter 3VII

But the strain told on them when they were back in the diningroom They
sat down very shaky and looked at each other

I dont feel I can settle to anything said Josephine until Ive had
something Do you think we could ask Kate for two cups of hot water

I really dont see why we shouldnt said Constantia carefully She
was quite normal again I wont ring Ill go to the kitchen door and
ask her

Yes do said Josephine sinking down into a chair Tell her just
two cups Con nothing elseon a tray

She neednt even put the jug on need she said Constantia as though
Kate might very well complain if the jug had been there

Oh no certainly not The jugs not at all necessary She can pour
it direct out of the kettle cried Josephine feeling that would be a
laboursaving indeed

Their cold lips quivered at the greenish brims Josephine curved her
small red hands round the cup Constantia sat up and blew on the wavy
steam making it flutter from one side to the other

Speaking of Benny said Josephine

And though Benny hadnt been mentioned Constantia immediately looked as
though he had

Hell expect us to send him something of fathers of course But its
so difficult to know what to send to Ceylon

You mean things get unstuck so on the voyage murmured Constantia

No lost said Josephine sharply You know theres no post Only
runners

Both paused to watch a black man in white linen drawers running through
the pale fields for dear life with a large brownpaper parcel in his
hands Josephines black man was tiny he scurried along glistening like
an ant But there was something blind and tireless about Constantias
tall thin fellow which made him she decided a very unpleasant person
indeed On the veranda dressed all in white and wearing a cork helmet
stood Benny His right hand shook up and down as fathers did when he
was impatient And behind him not in the least interested sat Hilda
the unknown sisterinlaw She swung in a cane rocker and flicked over
the leaves of the Tatler

I think his watch would be the most suitable present said Josephine

Constantia looked up she seemed surprised

Oh would you trust a gold watch to a native

But of course Id disguise it said Josephine No one would know
it was a watch She liked the idea of having to make a parcel such a
curious shape that no one could possibly guess what it was She
even thought for a moment of hiding the watch in a narrow cardboard
corsetbox that shed kept by her for a long time waiting for it to
come in for something It was such beautiful firm cardboard But no
it wouldnt be appropriate for this occasion It had lettering on it
Medium Womens 28 Extra Firm Busks It would be almost too much of a
surprise for Benny to open that and find fathers watch inside

And of course it isnt as though it would be goingticking I mean
said Constantia who was still thinking of the native love of jewellery
At least she added it would be very strange if after all that time
it was


Chapter 3VIII

Josephine made no reply She had flown off on one of her tangents
She had suddenly thought of Cyril Wasnt it more usual for the only
grandson to have the watch And then dear Cyril was so appreciative and
a gold watch meant so much to a young man Benny in all probability
had quite got out of the habit of watches men so seldom wore waistcoats
in those hot climates Whereas Cyril in London wore them from years end
to years end And it would be so nice for her and Constantia when he
came to tea to know it was there I see youve got on grandfathers
watch Cyril It would be somehow so satisfactory

Dear boy What a blow his sweet sympathetic little note had been Of
course they quite understood but it was most unfortunate

It would have been such a point having him said Josephine

And he would have enjoyed it so said Constantia not thinking what
she was saying

However as soon as he got back he was coming to tea with his aunties
Cyril to tea was one of their rare treats

Now Cyril you mustnt be frightened of our cakes Your Auntie Con and
I bought them at Buszards this morning We know what a mans appetite
is So dont be ashamed of making a good tea

Josephine cut recklessly into the rich dark cake that stood for her
winter gloves or the soling and heeling of Constantias only respectable
shoes But Cyril was most unmanlike in appetite

I say Aunt Josephine I simply cant Ive only just had lunch you
know

Oh Cyril that cant be true Its after four cried Josephine
Constantia sat with her knife poised over the chocolateroll

It is all the same said Cyril I had to meet a man at Victoria and
he kept me hanging about till there was only time to get lunch and
to come on here And he gave mephewCyril put his hand to his
foreheada terrific blowout he said

It was disappointingtoday of all days But still he couldnt be
expected to know

But youll have a meringue wont you Cyril said Aunt Josephine
These meringues were bought specially for you Your dear father was so
fond of them We were sure you are too

I am Aunt Josephine cried Cyril ardently Do you mind if I take
half to begin with

Not at all dear boy but we mustnt let you off with that

Is your dear father still so fond of meringues asked Auntie Con
gently She winced faintly as she broke through the shell of hers

Well I dont quite know Auntie Con said Cyril breezily

At that they both looked up

Dont know almost snapped Josephine Dont know a thing like that
about your own father Cyril

Surely said Auntie Con softly

Cyril tried to laugh it off Oh well he said its such a long time
since He faltered He stopped Their faces were too much for him

Even so said Josephine

And Auntie Con looked

Cyril put down his teacup Wait a bit he cried Wait a bit Aunt
Josephine What am I thinking of

He looked up They were beginning to brighten Cyril slapped his knee

Of course he said it was meringues How could I have forgotten
Yes Aunt Josephine youre perfectly right Fathers most frightfully
keen on meringues

They didnt only beam Aunt Josephine went scarlet with pleasure Auntie
Con gave a deep deep sigh

And now Cyril you must come and see father said Josephine He
knows you were coming today

Right said Cyril very firmly and heartily He got up from his chair
suddenly he glanced at the clock

I say Auntie Con isnt your clock a bit slow Ive got to meet a man
atat Paddington just after five Im afraid I shant be able to stay
very long with grandfather

Oh he wont expect you to stay very long said Aunt Josephine

Constantia was still gazing at the clock She couldnt make up her mind
if it was fast or slow It was one or the other she felt almost certain
of that At any rate it had been

Cyril still lingered Arent you coming along Auntie Con

Of course said Josephine we shall all go Come on Con


Chapter 3IX

They knocked at the door and Cyril followed his aunts into
grandfathers hot sweetish room

Come on said Grandfather Pinner Dont hang about What is it
Whatve you been up to

He was sitting in front of a roaring fire clasping his stick He had a
thick rug over his knees On his lap there lay a beautiful pale yellow
silk handkerchief

Its Cyril father said Josephine shyly And she took Cyrils hand
and led him forward

Good afternoon grandfather said Cyril trying to take his hand out
of Aunt Josephines Grandfather Pinner shot his eyes at Cyril in the
way he was famous for Where was Auntie Con She stood on the other side
of Aunt Josephine her long arms hung down in front of her her hands
were clasped She never took her eyes off grandfather

Well said Grandfather Pinner beginning to thump what have you got
to tell me

What had he what had he got to tell him Cyril felt himself smiling
like a perfect imbecile The room was stifling too

But Aunt Josephine came to his rescue She cried brightly Cyril says
his father is still very fond of meringues father dear

Eh said Grandfather Pinner curving his hand like a purple
meringueshell over one ear

Josephine repeated Cyril says his father is still very fond of
meringues

Cant hear said old Colonel Pinner And he waved Josephine away with
his stick then pointed with his stick to Cyril Tell me what shes
trying to say he said

My God Must I said Cyril blushing and staring at Aunt Josephine

Do dear she smiled It will please him so much

Come on out with it cried Colonel Pinner testily beginning to thump
again

And Cyril leaned forward and yelled Fathers still very fond of
meringues

At that Grandfather Pinner jumped as though he had been shot

Dont shout he cried Whats the matter with the boy Meringues
What about em

Oh Aunt Josephine must we go on groaned Cyril desperately

Its quite all right dear boy said Aunt Josephine as though he and
she were at the dentists together Hell understand in a minute And
she whispered to Cyril Hes getting a bit deaf you know Then she
leaned forward and really bawled at Grandfather Pinner Cyril only
wanted to tell you father dear that his father is still very fond of
meringues

Colonel Pinner heard that time heard and brooded looking Cyril up and
down

What an esstrordinary thing said old Grandfather Pinner What an
esstrordinary thing to come all this way here to tell me

And Cyril felt it was

Yes I shall send Cyril the watch said Josephine

That would be very nice said Constantia I seem to remember last
time he came there was some little trouble about the time


Chapter 3X

They were interrupted by Kate bursting through the door in her usual
fashion as though she had discovered some secret panel in the wall

Fried or boiled asked the bold voice

Fried or boiled Josephine and Constantia were quite bewildered for the
moment They could hardly take it in

Fried or boiled what Kate asked Josephine trying to begin to
concentrate

Kate gave a loud sniff Fish

Well why didnt you say so immediately Josephine reproached her
gently How could you expect us to understand Kate There are a great
many things in this world you know which are fried or boiled And
after such a display of courage she said quite brightly to Constantia
Which do you prefer Con

I think it might be nice to have it fried said Constantia On the
other hand of course boiled fish is very nice I think I prefer both
equally well Unless you In that case

I shall fry it said Kate and she bounced back leaving their door
open and slamming the door of her kitchen

Josephine gazed at Constantia she raised her pale eyebrows until they
rippled away into her pale hair She got up She said in a very
lofty imposing way Do you mind following me into the drawingroom
Constantia Ive got something of great importance to discuss with you

For it was always to the drawingroom they retired when they wanted to
talk over Kate

Josephine closed the door meaningly Sit down Constantia she said
still very grand She might have been receiving Constantia for the
first time And Con looked round vaguely for a chair as though she felt
indeed quite a stranger

Now the question is said Josephine bending forward whether we
shall keep her or not

That is the question agreed Constantia

And this time said Josephine firmly we must come to a definite
decision

Constantia looked for a moment as though she might begin going over all
the other times but she pulled herself together and said Yes Jug

You see Con explained Josephine everything is so changed now
Constantia looked up quickly I mean went on Josephine were not
dependent on Kate as we were And she blushed faintly Theres not
father to cook for

That is perfectly true agreed Constantia Father certainly doesnt
want any cooking now whatever else

Josephine broke in sharply Youre not sleepy are you Con

Sleepy Jug Constantia was wideeyed

Well concentrate more said Josephine sharply and she returned
to the subject What it comes to is if we didand this she barely
breathed glancing at the doorgive Kate noticeshe raised her voice
againwe could manage our own food

Why not cried Constantia She couldnt help smiling The idea was so
exciting She clasped her hands What should we live on Jug

Oh eggs in various forms said Jug lofty again And besides there
are all the cooked foods

But Ive always heard said Constantia they are considered so very
expensive

Not if one buys them in moderation said Josephine But she tore
herself away from this fascinating bypath and dragged Constantia after
her

What weve got to decide now however is whether we really do trust
Kate or not

Constantia leaned back Her flat little laugh flew from her lips

Isnt it curious Jug said she that just on this one subject Ive
never been able to quite make up my mind


Chapter 3XI

She never had The whole difficulty was to prove anything How did one
prove things how could one Suppose Kate had stood in front of her
and deliberately made a face Mightnt she very well have been in pain
Wasnt it impossible at any rate to ask Kate if she was making a face
at her If Kate answered Noand of course she would say Nowhat
a position How undignified Then again Constantia suspected she was
almost certain that Kate went to her chest of drawers when she and
Josephine were out not to take things but to spy Many times she had
come back to find her amethyst cross in the most unlikely places under
her lace ties or on top of her evening Bertha More than once she had
laid a trap for Kate She had arranged things in a special order and
then called Josephine to witness

You see Jug

Quite Con

Now we shall be able to tell

But oh dear when she did go to look she was as far off from a proof
as ever If anything was displaced it might so very well have happened
as she closed the drawer a jolt might have done it so easily

You come Jug and decide I really cant Its too difficult

But after a pause and a long glare Josephine would sigh Now youve put
the doubt into my mind Con Im sure I cant tell myself

Well we cant postpone it again said Josephine If we postpone it
this time


Chapter 3XII

But at that moment in the street below a barrelorgan struck up
Josephine and Constantia sprang to their feet together

Run Con said Josephine Run quickly Theres sixpence on the

Then they remembered It didnt matter They would never have to stop
the organgrinder again Never again would she and Constantia be told to
make that monkey take his noise somewhere else Never would sound that
loud strange bellow when father thought they were not hurrying enough
The organgrinder might play there all day and the stick would not
thump

 It never will thump again
 It never will thump again

played the barrelorgan

What was Constantia thinking She had such a strange smile she looked
different She couldnt be going to cry

Jug Jug said Constantia softly pressing her hands together Do you
know what day it is Its Saturday Its a week today a whole week

 A week since father died
 A week since father died

cried the barrelorgan And Josephine too forgot to be practical and
sensible she smiled faintly strangely On the Indian carpet there fell
a square of sunlight pale red it came and went and cameand stayed
deepeneduntil it shone almost golden

The suns out said Josephine as though it really mattered

A perfect fountain of bubbling notes shook from the barrelorgan round
bright notes carelessly scattered

Constantia lifted her big cold hands as if to catch them and then her
hands fell again She walked over to the mantelpiece to her favourite
Buddha And the stone and gilt image whose smile always gave her such
a queer feeling almost a pain and yet a pleasant pain seemed today
to be more than smiling He knew something he had a secret I know
something that you dont know said her Buddha Oh what was it what
could it be And yet she had always felt there was something

The sunlight pressed through the windows thieved its way in flashed
its light over the furniture and the photographs Josephine watched it
When it came to mothers photograph the enlargement over the piano it
lingered as though puzzled to find so little remained of mother except
the earrings shaped like tiny pagodas and a black feather boa Why did
the photographs of dead people always fade so wondered Josephine As
soon as a person was dead their photograph died too But of course
this one of mother was very old It was thirtyfive years old Josephine
remembered standing on a chair and pointing out that feather boa to
Constantia and telling her that it was a snake that had killed their
mother in Ceylon Would everything have been different if mother hadnt
died She didnt see why Aunt Florence had lived with them until they
had left school and they had moved three times and had their yearly
holiday and and thered been changes of servants of course

Some little sparrows young sparrows they sounded chirped on the
windowledge Yeepeyeepyeep But Josephine felt they were not
sparrows not on the windowledge It was inside her that queer little
crying noise Yeepeyeepyeep Ah what was it crying so weak and
forlorn

If mother had lived might they have married But there had been nobody
for them to marry There had been fathers AngloIndian friends before
he quarrelled with them But after that she and Constantia never met a
single man except clergymen How did one meet men Or even if theyd met
them how could they have got to know men well enough to be more than
strangers One read of people having adventures being followed and so
on But nobody had ever followed Constantia and her Oh yes there had
been one year at Eastbourne a mysterious man at their boardinghouse who
had put a note on the jug of hot water outside their bedroom door But
by the time Connie had found it the steam had made the writing too faint
to read they couldnt even make out to which of them it was addressed
And he had left next day And that was all The rest had been looking
after father and at the same time keeping out of fathers way But now
But now The thieving sun touched Josephine gently She lifted her face
She was drawn over to the window by gentle beams

Until the barrelorgan stopped playing Constantia stayed before the
Buddha wondering but not as usual not vaguely This time her wonder
was like longing She remembered the times she had come in here crept
out of bed in her nightgown when the moon was full and lain on the
floor with her arms outstretched as though she was crucified Why The
big pale moon had made her do it The horrible dancing figures on the
carved screen had leered at her and she hadnt minded She remembered
too how whenever they were at the seaside she had gone off by herself
and got as close to the sea as she could and sung something something
she had made up while she gazed all over that restless water There had
been this other life running out bringing things home in bags getting
things on approval discussing them with Jug and taking them back to
get more things on approval and arranging fathers trays and trying not
to annoy father But it all seemed to have happened in a kind of tunnel
It wasnt real It was only when she came out of the tunnel into the
moonlight or by the sea or into a thunderstorm that she really felt
herself What did it mean What was it she was always wanting What did
it all lead to Now Now

She turned away from the Buddha with one of her vague gestures She went
over to where Josephine was standing She wanted to say something to
Josephine something frightfully important aboutabout the future and
what

Dont you think perhaps she began

But Josephine interrupted her I was wondering if now she murmured
They stopped they waited for each other

Go on Con said Josephine

No no Jug after you said Constantia

No say what you were going to say You began said Josephine

I Id rather hear what you were going to say first said Constantia

Dont be absurd Con

Really Jug

Connie

Oh Jug

A pause Then Constantia said faintly I cant say what I was going to
say Jug because Ive forgotten what it was that I was going to say

Josephine was silent for a moment She stared at a big cloud where the
sun had been Then she replied shortly Ive forgotten too




4 MR AND MRS DOVE

Of course he knewno man betterthat he hadnt a ghost of a chance
he hadnt an earthly The very idea of such a thing was preposterous
So preposterous that hed perfectly understand it if her fatherwell
whatever her father chose to do hed perfectly understand In fact
nothing short of desperation nothing short of the fact that this was
positively his last day in England for God knows how long would have
screwed him up to it And even now He chose a tie out of the chest
of drawers a blue and cream check tie and sat on the side of his bed
Supposing she replied What impertinence would he be surprised Not
in the least he decided turning up his soft collar and turning it down
over the tie He expected her to say something like that He didnt see
if he looked at the affair dead soberly what else she could say

Here he was And nervously he tied a bow in front of the mirror jammed
his hair down with both hands pulled out the flaps of his jacket
pockets Making between 500 and 600 pounds a year on a fruit farm inof
all placesRhodesia No capital Not a penny coming to him No chance
of his income increasing for at least four years As for looks and all
that sort of thing he was completely out of the running He couldnt
even boast of tophole health for the East Africa business had knocked
him out so thoroughly that hed had to take six months leave He was
still fearfully paleworse even than usual this afternoon he thought
bending forward and peering into the mirror Good heavens What had
happened His hair looked almost bright green Dash it all he hadnt
green hair at all events That was a bit too steep And then the green
light trembled in the glass it was the shadow from the tree outside
Reggie turned away took out his cigarette case but remembering how the
mater hated him to smoke in his bedroom put it back again and drifted
over to the chest of drawers No he was dashed if he could think of one
blessed thing in his favour while she Ah He stopped dead folded
his arms and leaned hard against the chest of drawers

And in spite of her position her fathers wealth the fact
that she was an only child and far and away the most popular
girl in the neighbourhood in spite of her beauty and her
clevernessclevernessit was a great deal more than that there
was really nothing she couldnt do he fully believed had it been
necessary she would have been a genius at anythingin spite of the
fact that her parents adored her and she them and theyd as soon let
her go all that way as In spite of every single thing you could think
of so terrific was his love that he couldnt help hoping Well was
it hope Or was this queer timid longing to have the chance of looking
after her of making it his job to see that she had everything she
wanted and that nothing came near her that wasnt perfectjust love
How he loved her He squeezed hard against the chest of drawers and
murmured to it I love her I love her And just for the moment he was
with her on the way to Umtali It was night She sat in a corner asleep
Her soft chin was tucked into her soft collar her goldbrown lashes lay
on her cheeks He doted on her delicate little nose her perfect lips
her ear like a babys and the goldbrown curl that half covered it
They were passing through the jungle It was warm and dark and far away
Then she woke up and said Have I been asleep and he answered Yes
Are you all right Here let me And he leaned forward to He bent
over her This was such bliss that he could dream no further But it
gave him the courage to bound downstairs to snatch his straw hat from
the hall and to say as he closed the front door Well I can only try
my luck thats all

But his luck gave him a nasty jar to say the least almost immediately
Promenading up and down the garden path with Chinny and Biddy the
ancient Pekes was the mater Of course Reginald was fond of the mater
and all that Sheshe meant well she had no end of grit and so on
But there was no denying it she was rather a grim parent And there had
been moments many of them in Reggies life before Uncle Alick died
and left him the fruit farm when he was convinced that to be a widows
only son was about the worst punishment a chap could have And what made
it rougher than ever was that she was positively all that he had She
wasnt only a combined parent as it were but she had quarrelled with
all her own and the governors relations before Reggie had won his first
trouser pockets So that whenever Reggie was homesick out there sitting
on his dark veranda by starlight while the gramophone cried Dear
what is Life but Love his only vision was of the mater tall and
stout rustling down the garden path with Chinny and Biddy at her
heels

The mater with her scissors outspread to snap the head of a dead
something or other stopped at the sight of Reggie

You are not going out Reginald she asked seeing that he was

Ill be back for tea mater said Reggie weakly plunging his hands
into his jacket pockets

Snip Off came a head Reggie almost jumped

I should have thought you could have spared your mother your last
afternoon said she

Silence The Pekes stared They understood every word of the maters
Biddy lay down with her tongue poked out she was so fat and glossy she
looked like a lump of halfmelted toffee But Chinnys porcelain eyes
gloomed at Reginald and he sniffed faintly as though the whole world
were one unpleasant smell Snip went the scissors again Poor little
beggars they were getting it

And where are you going if your mother may ask asked the mater

It was over at last but Reggie did not slow down until he was out
of sight of the house and halfway to Colonel Proctors Then only he
noticed what a tophole afternoon it was It had been raining all the
morning late summer rain warm heavy quick and now the sky was
clear except for a long tail of little clouds like duckings sailing
over the forest There was just enough wind to shake the last drops off
the trees one warm star splashed on his hand Pinganother drummed
on his hat The empty road gleamed the hedges smelled of briar and how
big and bright the hollyhocks glowed in the cottage gardens And here
was Colonel Proctorshere it was already His hand was on the gate
his elbow jogged the syringa bushes and petals and pollen scattered
over his coat sleeve But wait a bit This was too quick altogether
Hed meant to think the whole thing out again Here steady But he was
walking up the path with the huge rose bushes on either side It cant
be done like this But his hand had grasped the bell given it a pull
and started it pealing wildly as if hed come to say the house was on
fire The housemaid must have been in the hall too for the front door
flashed open and Reggie was shut in the empty drawingroom before that
confounded bell had stopped ringing Strangely enough when it did the
big room shadowy with some ones parasol lying on top of the grand
piano bucked him upor rather excited him It was so quiet and yet
in one moment the door would open and his fate be decided The feeling
was not unlike that of being at the dentists he was almost reckless
But at the same time to his immense surprise Reggie heard himself
saying Lord Thou knowest Thou hast not done much for me  That
pulled him up that made him realize again how dead serious it was Too
late The door handle turned Anne came in crossed the shadowy space
between them gave him her hand and said in her small soft voice
Im so sorry father is out And mother is having a day in town
hathunting Theres only me to entertain you Reggie

Reggie gasped pressed his own hat to his jacket buttons and stammered
out As a matter of fact Ive only come to say goodbye

Oh cried Anne softlyshe stepped back from him and her grey eyes
dancedwhat a very short visit

Then watching him her chin tilted she laughed outright a long soft
peal and walked away from him over to the piano and leaned against it
playing with the tassel of the parasol

Im so sorry she said to be laughing like this I dont know why I
do Its just a bad hahabit And suddenly she stamped her grey shoe
and took a pockethandkerchief out of her white woolly jacket I really
must conquer it its too absurd said she

Good heavens Anne cried Reggie I love to hear you laughing I
cant imagine anything more

But the truth was and they both knew it she wasnt always laughing
it wasnt really a habit Only ever since the day theyd met ever since
that very first moment for some strange reason that Reggie wished to
God he understood Anne had laughed at him Why It didnt matter where
they were or what they were talking about They might begin by being
as serious as possible dead seriousat any rate as far as he was
concernedbut then suddenly in the middle of a sentence Anne would
glance at him and a little quick quiver passed over her face Her lips
parted her eyes danced and she began laughing

Another queer thing about it was Reggie had an idea she didnt herself
know why she laughed He had seen her turn away frown suck in her
cheeks press her hands together But it was no use The long soft peal
sounded even while she cried I dont know why Im laughing It was a
mystery

Now she tucked the handkerchief away

Do sit down said she And smoke wont you There are cigarettes in
that little box beside you Ill have one too He lighted a match for
her and as she bent forward he saw the tiny flame glow in the pearl
ring she wore It is tomorrow that youre going isnt it said Anne

Yes tomorrow as ever was said Reggie and he blew a little fan of
smoke Why on earth was he so nervous Nervous wasnt the word for it

Itsits frightfully hard to believe he added

Yesisnt it said Anne softly and she leaned forward and rolled
the point of her cigarette round the green ashtray How beautiful
she looked like thatsimply beautifuland she was so small in that
immense chair Reginalds heart swelled with tenderness but it was her
voice her soft voice that made him tremble I feel youve been here
for years she said

Reginald took a deep breath of his cigarette Its ghastly this idea
of going back he said

Cooroocoocoocoo sounded from the quiet

But youre fond of being out there arent you said Anne She hooked
her finger through her pearl necklace Father was saying only the other
night how lucky he thought you were to have a life of your own And
she looked up at him Reginalds smile was rather wan I dont feel
fearfully lucky he said lightly

Roocoocoocoo came again And Anne murmured You mean its
lonely

Oh it isnt the loneliness I care about said Reginald and he
stumped his cigarette savagely on the green ashtray I could stand any
amount of it used to like it even Its the idea of Suddenly to his
horror he felt himself blushing

Roocoocoocoo Roocoocoocoo

Anne jumped up Come and say goodbye to my doves she said Theyve
been moved to the side veranda You do like doves dont you Reggie

Awfully said Reggie so fervently that as he opened the French window
for her and stood to one side Anne ran forward and laughed at the doves
instead

To and fro to and fro over the fine red sand on the floor of the dove
house walked the two doves One was always in front of the other One
ran forward uttering a little cry and the other followed solemnly
bowing and bowing You see explained Anne the one in front shes
Mrs Dove She looks at Mr Dove and gives that little laugh and runs
forward and he follows her bowing and bowing And that makes her laugh
again Away she runs and after her cried Anne and she sat back on
her heels comes poor Mr Dove bowing and bowing and thats their
whole life They never do anything else you know She got up and took
some yellow grains out of a bag on the roof of the dove house When
you think of them out in Rhodesia Reggie you can be sure that is what
they will be doing 

Reggie gave no sign of having seen the doves or of having heard a word
For the moment he was conscious only of the immense effort it took to
tear his secret out of himself and offer it to Anne Anne do you think
you could ever care for me It was done It was over And in the little
pause that followed Reginald saw the garden open to the light the blue
quivering sky the flutter of leaves on the veranda poles and Anne
turning over the grains of maize on her palm with one finger Then
slowly she shut her hand and the new world faded as she murmured
slowly No never in that way But he had scarcely time to feel
anything before she walked quickly away and he followed her down the
steps along the garden path under the pink rose arches across the
lawn There with the gay herbaceous border behind her Anne faced
Reginald It isnt that Im not awfully fond of you she said I
am Buther eyes widenednot in the waya quiver passed over her
faceone ought to be fond of Her lips parted and she couldnt stop
herself She began laughing There you see you see she cried its
your check ttie Even at this moment when one would think one really
would be solemn your tie reminds me fearfully of the bowtie that cats
wear in pictures Oh please forgive me for being so horrid please

Reggie caught hold of her little warm hand Theres no question of
forgiving you he said quickly How could there be And I do believe I
know why I make you laugh Its because youre so far above me in every
way that I am somehow ridiculous I see that Anne But if I were to

No no Anne squeezed his hand hard Its not that Thats all wrong
Im not far above you at all Youre much better than I am Youre
marvellously unselfish and and kind and simple Im none of those
things You dont know me Im the most awful character said Anne
Please dont interrupt And besides thats not the point The point
isshe shook her headI couldnt possibly marry a man I laughed at
Surely you see that The man I marry breathed Anne softly She broke
off She drew her hand away and looking at Reggie she smiled strangely
dreamily The man I marry

And it seemed to Reggie that a tall handsome brilliant stranger
stepped in front of him and took his placethe kind of man that Anne
and he had seen often at the theatre walking on to the stage from
nowhere without a word catching the heroine in his arms and after one
long tremendous look carrying her off to anywhere

Reggie bowed to his vision Yes I see he said huskily

Do you said Anne Oh I do hope you do Because I feel so horrid
about it Its so hard to explain You know Ive never She stopped
Reggie looked at her She was smiling Isnt it funny she said
I can say anything to you I always have been able to from the very
beginning

He tried to smile to say Im glad She went on Ive never known any
one I like as much as I like you Ive never felt so happy with any one
But Im sure its not what people and what books mean when they talk
about love Do you understand Oh if you only knew how horrid I feel
But wed be like like Mr and Mrs Dove

That did it That seemed to Reginald final and so terribly true that he
could hardly bear it Dont drive it home he said and he turned away
from Anne and looked across the lawn There was the gardeners cottage
with the dark ilextree beside it A wet blue thumb of transparent
smoke hung above the chimney It didnt look real How his throat
ached Could he speak He had a shot I must be getting along home he
croaked and he began walking across the lawn But Anne ran after him
No dont You cant go yet she said imploringly You cant possibly
go away feeling like that And she stared up at him frowning biting
her lip

Oh thats all right said Reggie giving himself a shake Ill
Ill And he waved his hand as much to say get over it

But this is awful said Anne She clasped her hands and stood in front
of him Surely you do see how fatal it would be for us to marry dont
you

Oh quite quite said Reggie looking at her with haggard eyes

How wrong how wicked feeling as I do I mean its all very well for
Mr and Mrs Dove But imagine that in real lifeimagine it

Oh absolutely said Reggie and he started to walk on But again Anne
stopped him She tugged at his sleeve and to his astonishment this
time instead of laughing she looked like a little girl who was going
to cry

Then why if you understand are you so ununhappy she wailed Why
do you mind so fearfully Why do you look so awawful

Reggie gulped and again he waved something away I cant help it he
said Ive had a blow If I cut off now Ill be able to

How can you talk of cutting off now said Anne scornfully She stamped
her foot at Reggie she was crimson How can you be so cruel I cant
let you go until I know for certain that you are just as happy as you
were before you asked me to marry you Surely you must see that its so
simple

But it did not seem at all simple to Reginald It seemed impossibly
difficult

Even if I cant marry you how can I know that youre all that
way away with only that awful mother to write to and that youre
miserable and that its all my fault

Its not your fault Dont think that Its just fate Reggie took her
hand off his sleeve and kissed it Dont pity me dear little Anne he
said gently And this time he nearly ran under the pink arches along
the garden path

Roocoocoocoo Roocoocoocoo sounded from the veranda Reggie
Reggie from the garden

He stopped he turned But when she saw his timid puzzled look she
gave a little laugh

Come back Mr Dove said Anne And Reginald came slowly across the
lawn




5 THE YOUNG GIRL

In her blue dress with her cheeks lightly flushed her blue blue eyes
and her gold curls pinned up as though for the first timepinned up
to be out of the way for her flightMrs Raddicks daughter might have
just dropped from this radiant heaven Mrs Raddicks timid faintly
astonished but deeply admiring glance looked as if she believed it
too but the daughter didnt appear any too pleasedwhy should sheto
have alighted on the steps of the Casino Indeed she was boredbored
as though Heaven had been full of casinos with snuffy old saints for
croupiers and crowns to play with

You dont mind taking Hennie said Mrs Raddick Sure you dont
Theres the car and youll have tea and well be back here on this
stepright herein an hour You see I want her to go in Shes not
been before and its worth seeing I feel it wouldnt be fair to her

Oh shut up mother said she wearily Come along Dont talk so
much And your bags open youll be losing all your money again

Im sorry darling said Mrs Raddick

Oh do come in I want to make money said the impatient voice Its
all jolly well for youbut Im broke

Heretake fifty francs darling take a hundred I saw Mrs Raddick
pressing notes into her hand as they passed through the swing doors

Hennie and I stood on the steps a minute watching the people He had a
very broad delighted smile

I say he cried theres an English bulldog Are they allowed to take
dogs in there

No theyre not

Hes a ripping chap isnt he I wish I had one Theyre such fun They
frighten people so and theyre never fierce with theirthe people they
belong to Suddenly he squeezed my arm I say do look at that old
woman Who is she Why does she look like that Is she a gambler

The ancient withered creature wearing a green satin dress a black
velvet cloak and a white hat with purple feathers jerked slowly slowly
up the steps as though she were being drawn up on wires She stared in
front of her she was laughing and nodding and cackling to herself her
claws clutched round what looked like a dirty bootbag

But just at that moment there was Mrs Raddick again withherand
another lady hovering in the background Mrs Raddick rushed at me She
was brightly flushed gay a different creature She was like a woman
who is saying goodbye to her friends on the station platform with
not a minute to spare before the train starts

Oh youre here still Isnt that lucky Youve not gone Isnt that
fine Ive had the most dreadful time withher and she waved to
her daughter who stood absolutely still disdainful looking down
twiddling her foot on the step miles away They wont let her in I
swore she was twentyone But they wont believe me I showed the man
my purse I didnt dare to do more But it was no use He simply
scoffed And now Ive just met Mrs MacEwen from New York and she just
won thirteen thousand in the Salle Priveeand she wants me to go back
with her while the luck lasts Of course I cant leaveher But if
youd

At that she looked up she simply withered her mother Why cant
you leave me she said furiously What utter rot How dare you make
a scene like this This is the last time Ill come out with you You
really are too awful for words She looked her mother up and down
Calm yourself she said superbly

Mrs Raddick was desperate just desperate She was wild to go back
with Mrs MacEwen but at the same time

I seized my courage Would youdo you care to come to tea withus

Yes yes shell be delighted Thats just what I wanted isnt it
darling Mrs MacEwen Ill be back here in an hour or less Ill

Mrs R dashed up the steps I saw her bag was open again

So we three were left But really it wasnt my fault Hennie looked
crushed to the earth too When the car was there she wrapped her dark
coat round herto escape contamination Even her little feet looked as
though they scorned to carry her down the steps to us

I am so awfully sorry I murmured as the car started

Oh I dont mind said she I dont want to look twentyone Who
wouldif they were seventeen Itsand she gave a faint shudderthe
stupidity I loathe and being stared at by old fat men Beasts

Hennie gave her a quick look and then peered out of the window

We drew up before an immense palace of pinkandwhite marble with
orangetrees outside the doors in goldandblack tubs

Would you care to go in I suggested

She hesitated glanced bit her lip and resigned herself Oh well
there seems nowhere else said she Get out Hennie

I went firstto find the table of courseshe followed But the worst
of it was having her little brother who was only twelve with us That
was the last final strawhaving that child trailing at her heels

There was one table It had pink carnations and pink plates with little
blue teanapkins for sails

Shall we sit here

She put her hand wearily on the back of a white wicker chair

We may as well Why not said she

Hennie squeezed past her and wriggled on to a stool at the end He felt
awfully out of it She didnt even take her gloves off She lowered her
eyes and drummed on the table When a faint violin sounded she winced
and bit her lip again Silence

The waitress appeared I hardly dared to ask her Teacoffee China
teaor iced tea with lemon

Really she didnt mind It was all the same to her She didnt really
want anything Hennie whispered Chocolate

But just as the waitress turned away she cried out carelessly Oh you
may as well bring me a chocolate too

While we waited she took out a little gold powderbox with a mirror in
the lid shook the poor little puff as though she loathed it and dabbed
her lovely nose

Hennie she said take those flowers away She pointed with her puff
to the carnations and I heard her murmur I cant bear flowers on
a table They had evidently been giving her intense pain for she
positively closed her eyes as I moved them away

The waitress came back with the chocolate and the tea She put the
big frothing cups before them and pushed across my clear glass Hennie
buried his nose emerged with for one dreadful moment a little
trembling blob of cream on the tip But he hastily wiped it off like a
little gentleman I wondered if I should dare draw her attention to
her cup She didnt notice itdidnt see ituntil suddenly quite by
chance she took a sip I watched anxiously she faintly shuddered

Dreadfully sweet said she

A tiny boy with a head like a raisin and a chocolate body came
round with a tray of pastriesrow upon row of little freaks little
inspirations little melting dreams He offered them to her Oh Im
not at all hungry Take them away

He offered them to Hennie Hennie gave me a swift lookit must have
been satisfactoryfor he took a chocolate cream a coffee eclair
a meringue stuffed with chestnut and a tiny horn filled with fresh
strawberries She could hardly bear to watch him But just as the boy
swerved away she held up her plate

Oh well give me one said she

The silver tongs dropped one two threeand a cherry tartlet I dont
know why youre giving me all these she said and nearly smiled I
shant eat them I couldnt

I felt much more comfortable I sipped my tea leaned back and even
asked if I might smoke At that she paused the fork in her hand opened
her eyes and really did smile Of course said she I always expect
people to

But at that moment a tragedy happened to Hennie He speared his pastry
horn too hard and it flew in two and one half spilled on the table
Ghastly affair He turned crimson Even his ears flared and one ashamed
hand crept across the table to take what was left of the body away

You utter little beast said she

Good heavens I had to fly to the rescue I cried hastily Will you be
abroad long

But she had already forgotten Hennie I was forgotten too She was
trying to remember something She was miles away

Idontknow she said slowly from that far place

I suppose you prefer it to London Its moremore

When I didnt go on she came back and looked at me very puzzled
More

Enfingayer I cried waving my cigarette

But that took a whole cake to consider Even then Oh well that
depends was all she could safely say

Hennie had finished He was still very warm

I seized the butterfly list off the table I saywhat about an ice
Hennie What about tangerine and ginger No something cooler What
about a fresh pineapple cream

Hennie strongly approved The waitress had her eye on us The order was
taken when she looked up from her crumbs

Did you say tangerine and ginger I like ginger You can bring me one
And then quickly I wish that orchestra wouldnt play things from
the year One We were dancing to that all last Christmas Its too
sickening

But it was a charming air Now that I noticed it it warmed me

I think this is rather a nice place dont you Hennie I said

Hennie said Ripping He meant to say it very low but it came out
very high in a kind of squeak

Nice This place Nice For the first time she stared about her trying
to see what there was She blinked her lovely eyes wondered A very
goodlooking elderly man stared back at her through a monocle on a black
ribbon But him she simply couldnt see There was a hole in the air
where he was She looked through and through him

Finally the little flat spoons lay still on the glass plates Hennie
looked rather exhausted but she pulled on her white gloves again She
had some trouble with her diamond wristwatch it got in her way She
tugged at ittried to break the stupid little thingit wouldnt break
Finally she had to drag her glove over I saw after that she couldnt
stand this place a moment longer and indeed she jumped up and turned
away while I went through the vulgar act of paying for the tea

And then we were outside again It had grown dusky The sky was
sprinkled with small stars the big lamps glowed While we waited for
the car to come up she stood on the step just as before twiddling her
foot looking down

Hennie bounded forward to open the door and she got in and sank back
withohsuch a sigh

Tell him she gasped to drive as fast as he can

Hennie grinned at his friend the chauffeur Allie veet said he Then
he composed himself and sat on the small seat facing us

The gold powderbox came out again Again the poor little puff was
shaken again there was that swift deadlysecret glance between her and
the mirror

We tore through the blackandgold town like a pair of scissors tearing
through brocade Hennie had great difficulty not to look as though he
were hanging on to something

And when we reached the Casino of course Mrs Raddick wasnt there
There wasnt a sign of her on the stepsnot a sign

Will you stay in the car while I go and look

But noshe wouldnt do that Good heavens no Hennie could stay She
couldnt bear sitting in a car Shed wait on the steps

But I scarcely like to leave you I murmured Id very much rather
not leave you here

At that she threw back her coat she turned and faced me her lips
parted Good heavenswhy II dont mind it a bit II like
waiting And suddenly her cheeks crimsoned her eyes grew darkfor
a moment I thought she was going to cry Llet me please she
stammered in a warm eager voice I like it I love waiting
Reallyreally I do Im always waitingin all kinds of places 

Her dark coat fell open and her white throatall her soft young body
in the blue dresswas like a flower that is just emerging from its dark
bud




6 LIFE OF MA PARKER

When the literary gentleman whose flat old Ma Parker cleaned every
Tuesday opened the door to her that morning he asked after her
grandson Ma Parker stood on the doormat inside the dark little hall
and she stretched out her hand to help her gentleman shut the door
before she replied We buried im yesterday sir she said quietly

Oh dear me Im sorry to hear that said the literary gentleman in
a shocked tone He was in the middle of his breakfast He wore a very
shabby dressinggown and carried a crumpled newspaper in one hand
But he felt awkward He could hardly go back to the warm sittingroom
without saying somethingsomething more Then because these people set
such store by funerals he said kindly I hope the funeral went off all
right

Beg parding sir said old Ma Parker huskily

Poor old bird She did look dashed I hope the funeral was
aasuccess said he Ma Parker gave no answer She bent her head
and hobbled off to the kitchen clasping the old fish bag that held
her cleaning things and an apron and a pair of felt shoes The literary
gentleman raised his eyebrows and went back to his breakfast

Overcome I suppose he said aloud helping himself to the marmalade

Ma Parker drew the two jetty spears out of her toque and hung it behind
the door She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too Then she
tied her apron and sat down to take off her boots To take off her boots
or to put them on was an agony to her but it had been an agony for
years In fact she was so accustomed to the pain that her face was
drawn and screwed up ready for the twinge before shed so much as untied
the laces That over she sat back with a sigh and softly rubbed her
knees

Gran Gran Her little grandson stood on her lap in his button boots
Hed just come in from playing in the street

Look what a state youve made your grans skirt intoyou wicked boy

But he put his arms round her neck and rubbed his cheek against hers

Gran gi us a penny he coaxed

Be off with you Gran aint got no pennies

Yes you ave

No I aint

Yes you ave Gi us one

Already she was feeling for the old squashed black leather purse

Well whatll you give your gran

He gave a shy little laugh and pressed closer She felt his eyelid
quivering against her cheek I aint got nothing he murmured

The old woman sprang up seized the iron kettle off the gas stove and
took it over to the sink The noise of the water drumming in the
kettle deadened her pain it seemed She filled the pail too and the
washingup bowl

It would take a whole book to describe the state of that kitchen During
the week the literary gentleman did for himself That is to say he
emptied the tea leaves now and again into a jam jar set aside for that
purpose and if he ran out of clean forks he wiped over one or two
on the roller towel Otherwise as he explained to his friends his
system was quite simple and he couldnt understand why people made
all this fuss about housekeeping

You simply dirty everything youve got get a hag in once a week to
clean up and the things done

The result looked like a gigantic dustbin Even the floor was littered
with toast crusts envelopes cigarette ends But Ma Parker bore him no
grudge She pitied the poor young gentleman for having no one to look
after him Out of the smudgy little window you could see an immense
expanse of sadlooking sky and whenever there were clouds they looked
very worn old clouds frayed at the edges with holes in them or dark
stains like tea

While the water was heating Ma Parker began sweeping the floor Yes
she thought as the broom knocked what with one thing and another Ive
had my share Ive had a hard life

Even the neighbours said that of her Many a time hobbling home with
her fish bag she heard them waiting at the corner or leaning over
the area railings say among themselves Shes had a hard life has Ma
Parker And it was so true she wasnt in the least proud of it It was
just as if you were to say she lived in the basementback at Number 27
A hard life

At sixteen shed left Stratford and come up to London as kitchingmaid
Yes she was born in StratfordonAvon Shakespeare sir No people
were always arsking her about him But shed never heard his name until
she saw it on the theatres

Nothing remained of Stratford except that sitting in the fireplace
of a evening you could see the stars through the chimley and Mother
always ad er side of bacon anging from the ceiling And there was
somethinga bush there wasat the front door that smelt ever so
nice But the bush was very vague Shed only remembered it once or
twice in the hospital when shed been taken bad

That was a dreadful placeher first place She was never allowed out
She never went upstairs except for prayers morning and evening It was a
fair cellar And the cook was a cruel woman She used to snatch away her
letters from home before shed read them and throw them in the range
because they made her dreamy And the beedles Would you believe
ituntil she came to London shed never seen a black beedle Here Ma
always gave a little laugh as thoughnot to have seen a black beedle
Well It was as if to say youd never seen your own feet

When that family was sold up she went as help to a doctors house and
after two years there on the run from morning till night she married
her husband He was a baker

A baker Mrs Parker the literary gentleman would say For
occasionally he laid aside his tomes and lent an ear at least to this
product called Life It must be rather nice to be married to a baker

Mrs Parker didnt look so sure

Such a clean trade said the gentleman

Mrs Parker didnt look convinced

And didnt you like handing the new loaves to the customers

Well sir said Mrs Parker I wasnt in the shop above a great deal
We had thirteen little ones and buried seven of them If it wasnt the
ospital it was the infirmary you might say

You might indeed Mrs Parker said the gentleman shuddering and
taking up his pen again

Yes seven had gone and while the six were still small her husband was
taken ill with consumption It was flour on the lungs the doctor told
her at the time Her husband sat up in bed with his shirt pulled over
his head and the doctors finger drew a circle on his back

Now if we were to cut him open here Mrs Parker said the doctor
youd find his lungs chockablock with white powder Breathe my
good fellow And Mrs Parker never knew for certain whether she saw or
whether she fancied she saw a great fan of white dust come out of her
poor dead husbands lips

But the struggle shed had to bring up those six little children and
keep herself to herself Terrible it had been Then just when they were
old enough to go to school her husbands sister came to stop with them
to help things along and she hadnt been there more than two months
when she fell down a flight of steps and hurt her spine And for five
years Ma Parker had another babyand such a one for cryingto look
after Then young Maudie went wrong and took her sister Alice with her
the two boys emigrated and young Jim went to India with the army and
Ethel the youngest married a goodfornothing little waiter who died
of ulcers the year little Lennie was born And now little Lenniemy
grandson

The piles of dirty cups dirty dishes were washed and dried The
inkblack knives were cleaned with a piece of potato and finished off
with a piece of cork The table was scrubbed and the dresser and the
sink that had sardine tails swimming in it

Hed never been a strong childnever from the first Hed been one of
those fair babies that everybody took for a girl Silvery fair curls he
had blue eyes and a little freckle like a diamond on one side of his
nose The trouble she and Ethel had had to rear that child The things
out of the newspapers they tried him with Every Sunday morning Ethel
would read aloud while Ma Parker did her washing

Dear SirJust a line to let you know my little Myrtil was laid out
for dead After four bottils gained 8 lbs in 9 weeks and is still
putting it on

And then the eggcup of ink would come off the dresser and the letter
would be written and Ma would buy a postal order on her way to work
next morning But it was no use Nothing made little Lennie put it
on Taking him to the cemetery even never gave him a colour a nice
shakeup in the bus never improved his appetite

But he was grans boy from the first

Whose boy are you said old Ma Parker straightening up from the stove
and going over to the smudgy window And a little voice so warm so
close it half stifled herit seemed to be in her breast under her
heartlaughed out and said Im grans boy

At that moment there was a sound of steps and the literary gentleman
appeared dressed for walking

Oh Mrs Parker Im going out

Very good sir

And youll find your halfcrown in the tray of the inkstand

Thank you sir

Oh by the way Mrs Parker said the literary gentleman quickly you
didnt throw away any cocoa last time you were heredid you

No sir Very strange I could have sworn I left a teaspoonful of
cocoa in the tin He broke off He said softly and firmly Youll
always tell me when you throw things awaywont you Mrs Parker And
he walked off very well pleased with himself convinced in fact
hed shown Mrs Parker that under his apparent carelessness he was as
vigilant as a woman

The door banged She took her brushes and cloths into the bedroom But
when she began to make the bed smoothing tucking patting the thought
of little Lennie was unbearable Why did he have to suffer so Thats
what she couldnt understand Why should a little angel child have to
arsk for his breath and fight for it There was no sense in making a
child suffer like that

 From Lennies little box of a chest there came a sound as though
something was boiling There was a great lump of something bubbling in
his chest that he couldnt get rid of When he coughed the sweat sprang
out on his head his eyes bulged his hands waved and the great lump
bubbled as a potato knocks in a saucepan But what was more awful than
all was when he didnt cough he sat against the pillow and never spoke
or answered or even made as if he heard Only he looked offended

Its not your poor old grans doing it my lovey said old Ma Parker
patting back the damp hair from his little scarlet ears But Lennie
moved his head and edged away Dreadfully offended with her he
lookedand solemn He bent his head and looked at her sideways as
though he couldnt have believed it of his gran

But at the last Ma Parker threw the counterpane over the bed No she
simply couldnt think about it It was too muchshed had too much
in her life to bear Shed borne it up till now shed kept herself
to herself and never once had she been seen to cry Never by a living
soul Not even her own children had seen Ma break down Shed kept a
proud face always But now Lennie gonewhat had she She had nothing
He was all shed got from life and now he was took too Why must it
all have happened to me she wondered What have I done said old Ma
Parker What have I done

As she said those words she suddenly let fall her brush She found
herself in the kitchen Her misery was so terrible that she pinned on
her hat put on her jacket and walked out of the flat like a person in
a dream She did not know what she was doing She was like a person so
dazed by the horror of what has happened that he walks awayanywhere
as though by walking away he could escape

It was cold in the street There was a wind like ice People went
flitting by very fast the men walked like scissors the women trod
like cats And nobody knewnobody cared Even if she broke down if at
last after all these years she were to cry shed find herself in the
lockup as like as not

But at the thought of crying it was as though little Lennie leapt in
his grans arms Ah thats what she wants to do my dove Gran wants
to cry If she could only cry now cry for a long time over everything
beginning with her first place and the cruel cook going on to the
doctors and then the seven little ones death of her husband the
childrens leaving her and all the years of misery that led up to
Lennie But to have a proper cry over all these things would take a
long time All the same the time for it had come She must do it She
couldnt put it off any longer she couldnt wait any more Where could
she go

Shes had a hard life has Ma Parker Yes a hard life indeed Her
chin began to tremble there was no time to lose But where Where

She couldnt go home Ethel was there It would frighten Ethel out
of her life She couldnt sit on a bench anywhere people would come
arsking her questions She couldnt possibly go back to the gentlemans
flat she had no right to cry in strangers houses If she sat on some
steps a policeman would speak to her

Oh wasnt there anywhere where she could hide and keep herself to
herself and stay as long as she liked not disturbing anybody and
nobody worrying her Wasnt there anywhere in the world where she could
have her cry outat last

Ma Parker stood looking up and down The icy wind blew out her apron
into a balloon And now it began to rain There was nowhere




7 MARRIAGE A LA MODE

On his way to the station William remembered with a fresh pang of
disappointment that he was taking nothing down to the kiddies Poor
little chaps It was hard lines on them Their first words always were
as they ran to greet him What have you got for me daddy and he had
nothing He would have to buy them some sweets at the station But that
was what he had done for the past four Saturdays their faces had fallen
last time when they saw the same old boxes produced again

And Paddy had said I had red ribbing on mine beefore

And Johnny had said Its always pink on mine I hate pink

But what was William to do The affair wasnt so easily settled In the
old days of course he would have taken a taxi off to a decent toyshop
and chosen them something in five minutes But nowadays they had Russian
toys French toys Serbian toystoys from God knows where It was over
a year since Isabel had scrapped the old donkeys and engines and so on
because they were so dreadfully sentimental and so appallingly bad
for the babies sense of form

Its so important the new Isabel had explained that they should
like the right things from the very beginning It saves so much time
later on Really if the poor pets have to spend their infant years
staring at these horrors one can imagine them growing up and asking to
be taken to the Royal Academy

And she spoke as though a visit to the Royal Academy was certain
immediate death to any one

Well I dont know said William slowly When I was their age I used
to go to bed hugging an old towel with a knot in it

The new Isabel looked at him her eyes narrowed her lips apart

Dear William Im sure you did She laughed in the new way

Sweets it would have to be however thought William gloomily fishing
in his pocket for change for the taximan And he saw the kiddies
handing the boxes roundthey were awfully generous little chapswhile
Isabels precious friends didnt hesitate to help themselves

What about fruit William hovered before a stall just inside the
station What about a melon each Would they have to share that too
Or a pineapple for Pad and a melon for Johnny Isabels friends could
hardly go sneaking up to the nursery at the childrens mealtimes All
the same as he bought the melon William had a horrible vision of one
of Isabels young poets lapping up a slice for some reason behind the
nursery door

With his two very awkward parcels he strode off to his train The
platform was crowded the train was in Doors banged open and shut
There came such a loud hissing from the engine that people looked dazed
as they scurried to and fro William made straight for a firstclass
smoker stowed away his suitcase and parcels and taking a huge wad of
papers out of his inner pocket he flung down in the corner and began to
read

Our client moreover is positive We are inclined to reconsider in
the event of Ah that was better William pressed back his flattened
hair and stretched his legs across the carriage floor The familiar dull
gnawing in his breast quietened down With regard to our decision He
took out a blue pencil and scored a paragraph slowly

Two men came in stepped across him and made for the farther corner A
young fellow swung his golf clubs into the rack and sat down opposite
The train gave a gentle lurch they were off William glanced up and saw
the hot bright station slipping away A redfaced girl raced along by
the carriages there was something strained and almost desperate in the
way she waved and called Hysterical thought William dully Then a
greasy blackfaced workman at the end of the platform grinned at the
passing train And William thought A filthy life and went back to
his papers

When he looked up again there were fields and beasts standing for
shelter under the dark trees A wide river with naked children
splashing in the shallows glided into sight and was gone again The sky
shone pale and one bird drifted high like a dark fleck in a jewel

We have examined our clients correspondence files  The last
sentence he had read echoed in his mind We have examined  William
hung on to that sentence but it was no good it snapped in the
middle and the fields the sky the sailing bird the water all said
Isabel The same thing happened every Saturday afternoon When he
was on his way to meet Isabel there began those countless imaginary
meetings She was at the station standing just a little apart from
everybody else she was sitting in the open taxi outside she was at
the garden gate walking across the parched grass at the door or just
inside the hall

And her clear light voice said Its William or Hillo William or
So William has come He touched her cool hand her cool cheek

The exquisite freshness of Isabel When he had been a little boy it was
his delight to run into the garden after a shower of rain and shake the
rosebush over him Isabel was that rosebush petalsoft sparkling and
cool And he was still that little boy But there was no running into
the garden now no laughing and shaking The dull persistent gnawing in
his breast started again He drew up his legs tossed the papers aside
and shut his eyes

What is it Isabel What is it he said tenderly They were in their
bedroom in the new house Isabel sat on a painted stool before the
dressingtable that was strewn with little black and green boxes

What is what William And she bent forward and her fine light hair
fell over her cheeks

Ah you know He stood in the middle of the room and he felt a
stranger At that Isabel wheeled round quickly and faced him

Oh William she cried imploringly and she held up the hairbrush
Please Please dont be so dreadfully stuffy andtragic Youre always
saying or looking or hinting that Ive changed Just because Ive got to
know really congenial people and go about more and am frightfully keen
onon everything you behave as though Id Isabel tossed back
her hair and laughedkilled our love or something Its so awfully
absurdshe bit her lipand its so maddening William Even this new
house and the servants you grudge me

Isabel

Yes yes its true in a way said Isabel quickly You think they are
another bad sign Oh I know you do I feel it she said softly every
time you come up the stairs But we couldnt have gone on living in
that other poky little hole William Be practical at least Why there
wasnt enough room for the babies even

No it was true Every morning when he came back from chambers it was to
find the babies with Isabel in the back drawingroom They were having
rides on the leopard skin thrown over the sofa back or they were
playing shops with Isabels desk for a counter or Pad was sitting on
the hearthrug rowing away for dear life with a little brass fire shovel
while Johnny shot at pirates with the tongs Every evening they each had
a pickaback up the narrow stairs to their fat old Nanny

Yes he supposed it was a poky little house A little white house with
blue curtains and a windowbox of petunias William met their friends at
the door with Seen our petunias Pretty terrific for London dont you
think

But the imbecile thing the absolutely extraordinary thing was that he
hadnt the slightest idea that Isabel wasnt as happy as he God what
blindness He hadnt the remotest notion in those days that she really
hated that inconvenient little house that she thought the fat Nanny
was ruining the babies that she was desperately lonely pining for new
people and new music and pictures and so on If they hadnt gone to that
studio party at Moira Morrisonsif Moira Morrison hadnt said as they
were leaving Im going to rescue your wife selfish man Shes like
an exquisite little Titaniaif Isabel hadnt gone with Moira to
Parisifif

The train stopped at another station Bettingford Good heavens Theyd
be there in ten minutes William stuffed that papers back into his
pockets the young man opposite had long since disappeared Now the
other two got out The late afternoon sun shone on women in cotton
frocks and little sunburnt barefoot children It blazed on a silky
yellow flower with coarse leaves which sprawled over a bank of rock The
air ruffling through the window smelled of the sea Had Isabel the same
crowd with her this weekend wondered William

And he remembered the holidays they used to have the four of them with
a little farm girl Rose to look after the babies Isabel wore a jersey
and her hair in a plait she looked about fourteen Lord how his nose
used to peel And the amount they ate and the amount they slept in that
immense feather bed with their feet locked together William couldnt
help a grim smile as he thought of Isabels horror if she knew the full
extent of his sentimentality



Hillo William She was at the station after all standing just as he
had imagined apart from the others andWilliams heart leaptshe was
alone

Hallo Isabel William stared He thought she looked so beautiful that
he had to say something You look very cool

Do I said Isabel I dont feel very cool Come along your horrid
old train is late The taxis outside She put her hand lightly on his
arm as they passed the ticket collector Weve all come to meet you
she said But weve left Bobby Kane at the sweet shop to be called
for

Oh said William It was all he could say for the moment

There in the glare waited the taxi with Bill Hunt and Dennis Green
sprawling on one side their hats tilted over their faces while on the
other Moira Morrison in a bonnet like a huge strawberry jumped up and
down

No ice No ice No ice she shouted gaily

And Dennis chimed in from under his hat Only to be had from the
fishmongers

And Bill Hunt emerging added With whole fish in it

Oh what a bore wailed Isabel And she explained to William how
they had been chasing round the town for ice while she waited for
him Simply everything is running down the steep cliffs into the sea
beginning with the butter

We shall have to anoint ourselves with butter said Dennis May thy
head William lack not ointment

Look here said William how are we going to sit Id better get up
by the driver

No Bobby Kanes by the driver said Isabel Youre to sit between
Moira and me The taxi started What have you got in those mysterious
parcels

Decapitated heads said Bill Hunt shuddering beneath his hat

Oh fruit Isabel sounded very pleased Wise William A melon and a
pineapple How too nice

No wait a bit said William smiling But he really was anxious I
brought them down for the kiddies

Oh my dear Isabel laughed and slipped her hand through his arm
Theyd be rolling in agonies if they were to eat them Noshe patted
his handyou must bring them something next time I refuse to part
with my pineapple

Cruel Isabel Do let me smell it said Moira She flung her arms
across William appealingly Oh The strawberry bonnet fell forward
she sounded quite faint

A Lady in Love with a Pineapple said Dennis as the taxi drew up
before a little shop with a striped blind Out came Bobby Kane his arms
full of little packets

I do hope theyll be good Ive chosen them because of the colours
There are some round things which really look too divine And just look
at this nougat he cried ecstatically just look at it Its a perfect
little ballet

But at that moment the shopman appeared Oh I forgot Theyre none of
them paid for said Bobby looking frightened Isabel gave the shopman
a note and Bobby was radiant again Hallo William Im sitting by the
driver And bareheaded all in white with his sleeves rolled up to the
shoulders he leapt into his place Avanti he cried

After tea the others went off to bathe while William stayed and made
his peace with the kiddies But Johnny and Paddy were asleep the
rosered glow had paled bats were flying and still the bathers had
not returned As William wandered downstairs the maid crossed the hall
carrying a lamp He followed her into the sittingroom It was a long
room coloured yellow On the wall opposite William some one had painted
a young man over lifesize with very wobbly legs offering a wideeyed
daisy to a young woman who had one very short arm and one very long
thin one Over the chairs and sofa there hung strips of black material
covered with big splashes like broken eggs and everywhere one looked
there seemed to be an ashtray full of cigarette ends William sat down
in one of the armchairs Nowadays when one felt with one hand down the
sides it wasnt to come upon a sheep with three legs or a cow that had
lost one horn or a very fat dove out of the Noahs Ark One fished
up yet another little papercovered book of smudgedlooking poems He
thought of the wad of papers in his pocket but he was too hungry and
tired to read The door was open sounds came from the kitchen The
servants were talking as if they were alone in the house Suddenly
there came a loud screech of laughter and an equally loud Sh They had
remembered him William got up and went through the French windows into
the garden and as he stood there in the shadow he heard the bathers
coming up the sandy road their voices rang through the quiet

I think its up to Moira to use her little arts and wiles

A tragic moan from Moira

We ought to have a gramophone for the weekends that played The Maid of
the Mountains

Oh no Oh no cried Isabels voice Thats not fair to William Be
nice to him my children Hes only staying until tomorrow evening

Leave him to me cried Bobby Kane Im awfully good at looking after
people

The gate swung open and shut William moved on the terrace they had
seen him Hallo William And Bobby Kane flapping his towel began to
leap and pirouette on the parched lawn Pity you didnt come William
The water was divine And we all went to a little pub afterwards and had
sloe gin

The others had reached the house I say Isabel called Bobby would
you like me to wear my Nijinsky dress tonight

No said Isabel nobodys going to dress Were all starving
Williams starving too Come along mes amis lets begin with
sardines

Ive found the sardines said Moira and she ran into the hall
holding a box high in the air

A Lady with a Box of Sardines said Dennis gravely

Well William and hows London asked Bill Hunt drawing the cork out
of a bottle of whisky

Oh Londons not much changed answered William

Good old London said Bobby very hearty spearing a sardine

But a moment later William was forgotten Moira Morrison began wondering
what colour ones legs really were under water

Mine are the palest palest mushroom colour

Bill and Dennis ate enormously And Isabel filled glasses and changed
plates and found matches smiling blissfully At one moment she said
I do wish Bill youd paint it

Paint what said Bill loudly stuffing his mouth with bread

Us said Isabel round the table It would be so fascinating in
twenty years time

Bill screwed up his eyes and chewed Lights wrong he said rudely
far too much yellow and went on eating And that seemed to charm
Isabel too

But after supper they were all so tired they could do nothing but yawn
until it was late enough to go to bed

It was not until William was waiting for his taxi the next afternoon
that he found himself alone with Isabel When he brought his suitcase
down into the hall Isabel left the others and went over to him She
stooped down and picked up the suitcase What a weight she said and
she gave a little awkward laugh Let me carry it To the gate

No why should you said William Of course not Give it to me

Oh please do let me said Isabel I want to really They walked
together silently William felt there was nothing to say now

There said Isabel triumphantly setting the suitcase down and she
looked anxiously along the sandy road I hardly seem to have seen you
this time she said breathlessly Its so short isnt it I feel
youve only just come Next time The taxi came into sight I hope
they look after you properly in London Im so sorry the babies have
been out all day but Miss Neil had arranged it Theyll hate missing
you Poor William going back to London The taxi turned Goodbye
She gave him a little hurried kiss she was gone

Fields trees hedges streamed by They shook through the empty
blindlooking little town ground up the steep pull to the station

The train was in William made straight for a firstclass smoker flung
back into the corner but this time he let the papers alone He folded
his arms against the dull persistent gnawing and began in his mind to
write a letter to Isabel



The post was late as usual They sat outside the house in long chairs
under coloured parasols Only Bobby Kane lay on the turf at Isabels
feet It was dull stifling the day drooped like a flag

Do you think there will be Mondays in Heaven asked Bobby childishly

And Dennis murmured Heaven will be one long Monday

But Isabel couldnt help wondering what had happened to the salmon they
had for supper last night She had meant to have fish mayonnaise for
lunch and now

Moira was asleep Sleeping was her latest discovery Its so wonderful
One simply shuts ones eyes thats all Its so delicious

When the old ruddy postman came beating along the sandy road on his
tricycle one felt the handlebars ought to have been oars

Bill Hunt put down his book Letters he said complacently and they
all waited But heartless postmanO malignant world There was only
one a fat one for Isabel Not even a paper

And mines only from William said Isabel mournfully

From Williamalready

Hes sending you back your marriage lines as a gentle reminder

Does everybody have marriage lines I thought they were only for
servants

Pages and pages Look at her A Lady reading a Letter said Dennis

My darling precious Isabel Pages and pages there were As Isabel
read on her feeling of astonishment changed to a stifled feeling What
on earth had induced William  How extraordinary it was What
could have made him  She felt confused more and more excited even
frightened It was just like William Was it It was absurd of course
it must be absurd ridiculous Ha ha ha Oh dear What was she to
do Isabel flung back in her chair and laughed till she couldnt stop
laughing

Do do tell us said the others You must tell us

Im longing to gurgled Isabel She sat up gathered the letter
and waved it at them Gather round she said Listen its too
marvellous A loveletter

A loveletter But how divine Darling precious Isabel But she had
hardly begun before their laughter interrupted her

Go on Isabel its perfect

Its the most marvellous find

Oh do go on Isabel

God forbid my darling that I should be a drag on your happiness

Oh oh oh

Sh sh sh

And Isabel went on When she reached the end they were hysterical Bobby
rolled on the turf and almost sobbed

You must let me have it just as it is entire for my new book said
Dennis firmly I shall give it a whole chapter

Oh Isabel moaned Moira that wonderful bit about holding you in his
arms

I always thought those letters in divorce cases were made up But they
pale before this

Let me hold it Let me read it mine own self said Bobby Kane

But to their surprise Isabel crushed the letter in her hand She
was laughing no longer She glanced quickly at them all she looked
exhausted No not just now Not just now she stammered

And before they could recover she had run into the house through the
hall up the stairs into her bedroom Down she sat on the side of
the bed How vile odious abominable vulgar muttered Isabel She
pressed her eyes with her knuckles and rocked to and fro And again she
saw them but not four more like forty laughing sneering jeering
stretching out their hands while she read them Williams letter Oh
what a loathsome thing to have done How could she have done it God
forbid my darling that I should be a drag on your happiness William
Isabel pressed her face into the pillow But she felt that even the
grave bedroom knew her for what she was shallow tinkling vain

Presently from the garden below there came voices

Isabel were all going for a bathe Do come

Come thou wife of William

Call her once before you go call once yet

Isabel sat up Now was the moment now she must decide Would she go
with them or stay here and write to William Which which should it be
I must make up my mind Oh but how could there be any question Of
course she would stay here and write

Titania piped Moira

Isabel

No it was too difficult IllIll go with them and write to William
later Some other time Later Not now But I shall certainly write
thought Isabel hurriedly

And laughing in the new way she ran down the stairs




8 THE VOYAGE

The Picton boat was due to leave at halfpast eleven It was a beautiful
night mild starry only when they got out of the cab and started to
walk down the Old Wharf that jutted out into the harbour a faint wind
blowing off the water ruffled under Fenellas hat and she put up her
hand to keep it on It was dark on the Old Wharf very dark the wool
sheds the cattle trucks the cranes standing up so high the little
squat railway engine all seemed carved out of solid darkness Here and
there on a rounded woodpile that was like the stalk of a huge black
mushroom there hung a lantern but it seemed afraid to unfurl its
timid quivering light in all that blackness it burned softly as if
for itself

Fenellas father pushed on with quick nervous strides Beside him her
grandma bustled along in her crackling black ulster they went so fast
that she had now and again to give an undignified little skip to keep up
with them As well as her luggage strapped into a neat sausage Fenella
carried clasped to her her grandmas umbrella and the handle which was
a swans head kept giving her shoulder a sharp little peck as if it too
wanted her to hurry Men their caps pulled down their collars turned
up swung by a few women all muffled scurried along and one tiny boy
only his little black arms and legs showing out of a white woolly shawl
was jerked along angrily between his father and mother he looked like a
baby fly that had fallen into the cream

Then suddenly so suddenly that Fenella and her grandma both leapt
there sounded from behind the largest wool shed that had a trail of
smoke hanging over it MiaooooOO

First whistle said her father briefly and at that moment they came
in sight of the Picton boat Lying beside the dark wharf all strung
all beaded with round golden lights the Picton boat looked as if she
was more ready to sail among stars than out into the cold sea People
pressed along the gangway First went her grandma then her father then
Fenella There was a high step down on to the deck and an old sailor in
a jersey standing by gave her his dry hard hand They were there they
stepped out of the way of the hurrying people and standing under
a little iron stairway that led to the upper deck they began to say
goodbye

There mother theres your luggage said Fenellas father giving
grandma another strappedup sausage

Thank you Frank

And youve got your cabin tickets safe

Yes dear

And your other tickets

Grandma felt for them inside her glove and showed him the tips

Thats right

He sounded stern but Fenella eagerly watching him saw that he looked
tired and sad MiaooooOO The second whistle blared just above
their heads and a voice like a cry shouted Any more for the gangway

Youll give my love to father Fenella saw her fathers lips say And
her grandma very agitated answered Of course I will dear Go now
Youll be left Go now Frank Go now

Its all right mother Ive got another three minutes To her
surprise Fenella saw her father take off his hat He clasped grandma in
his arms and pressed her to him God bless you mother she heard him
say

And grandma put her hand with the black thread glove that was worn
through on her ring finger against his cheek and she sobbed God
bless you my own brave son

This was so awful that Fenella quickly turned her back on them
swallowed once twice and frowned terribly at a little green star on a
mast head But she had to turn round again her father was going

Goodbye Fenella Be a good girl His cold wet moustache brushed her
cheek But Fenella caught hold of the lapels of his coat

How long am I going to stay she whispered anxiously He wouldnt look
at her He shook her off gently and gently said Well see about that
Here Wheres your hand He pressed something into her palm Heres a
shilling in case you should need it

A shilling She must be going away for ever Father cried Fenella
But he was gone He was the last off the ship The sailors put their
shoulders to the gangway A huge coil of dark rope went flying through
the air and fell thump on the wharf A bell rang a whistle shrilled
Silently the dark wharf began to slip to slide to edge away from them
Now there was a rush of water between Fenella strained to see with all
her might Was that father turning roundor wavingor standing
aloneor walking off by himself The strip of water grew broader
darker Now the Picton boat began to swing round steady pointing out to
sea It was no good looking any longer There was nothing to be seen but
a few lights the face of the town clock hanging in the air and more
lights little patches of them on the dark hills

The freshening wind tugged at Fenellas skirts she went back to her
grandma To her relief grandma seemed no longer sad She had put the
two sausages of luggage one on top of the other and she was sitting
on them her hands folded her head a little on one side There was an
intent bright look on her face Then Fenella saw that her lips were
moving and guessed that she was praying But the old woman gave her a
bright nod as if to say the prayer was nearly over She unclasped
her hands sighed clasped them again bent forward and at last gave
herself a soft shake

And now child she said fingering the bow of her bonnetstrings I
think we ought to see about our cabins Keep close to me and mind you
dont slip

Yes grandma

And be careful the umbrellas arent caught in the stair rail I saw a
beautiful umbrella broken in half like that on my way over

Yes grandma

Dark figures of men lounged against the rails In the glow of
their pipes a nose shone out or the peak of a cap or a pair of
surprisedlooking eyebrows Fenella glanced up High in the air a
little figure his hands thrust in his short jacket pockets stood
staring out to sea The ship rocked ever so little and she thought the
stars rocked too And now a pale steward in a linen coat holding a
tray high in the palm of his hand stepped out of a lighted doorway and
skimmed past them They went through that doorway Carefully over the
high brassbound step on to the rubber mat and then down such a terribly
steep flight of stairs that grandma had to put both feet on each step
and Fenella clutched the clammy brass rail and forgot all about the
swannecked umbrella

At the bottom grandma stopped Fenella was rather afraid she was going
to pray again But no it was only to get out the cabin tickets They
were in the saloon It was glaring bright and stifling the air smelled
of paint and burnt chopbones and indiarubber Fenella wished her
grandma would go on but the old woman was not to be hurried An immense
basket of ham sandwiches caught her eye She went up to them and touched
the top one delicately with her finger

How much are the sandwiches she asked

Tuppence bawled a rude steward slamming down a knife and fork

Grandma could hardly believe it

Twopence each she asked

Thats right said the steward and he winked at his companion

Grandma made a small astonished face Then she whispered primly to
Fenella What wickedness And they sailed out at the further door
and along a passage that had cabins on either side Such a very nice
stewardess came to meet them She was dressed all in blue and her
collar and cuffs were fastened with large brass buttons She seemed to
know grandma well

Well Mrs Crane said she unlocking their washstand Weve got you
back again Its not often you give yourself a cabin

No said grandma But this time my dear sons thoughtfulness

I hope began the stewardess Then she turned round and took a long
mournful look at grandmas blackness and at Fenellas black coat and
skirt black blouse and hat with a crape rose

Grandma nodded It was Gods will said she

The stewardess shut her lips and taking a deep breath she seemed to
expand

What I always say is she said as though it was her own discovery
sooner or later each of us has to go and thats a certingty She
paused Now can I bring you anything Mrs Crane A cup of tea I know
its no good offering you a little something to keep the cold out

Grandma shook her head Nothing thank you Weve got a few wine
biscuits and Fenella has a very nice banana

Then Ill give you a look later on said the stewardess and she went
out shutting the door

What a very small cabin it was It was like being shut up in a box with
grandma The dark round eye above the washstand gleamed at them dully
Fenella felt shy She stood against the door still clasping her luggage
and the umbrella Were they going to get undressed in here Already her
grandma had taken off her bonnet and rolling up the strings she fixed
each with a pin to the lining before she hung the bonnet up Her white
hair shone like silk the little bun at the back was covered with a
black net Fenella hardly ever saw her grandma with her head uncovered
she looked strange

I shall put on the woollen fascinator your dear mother crocheted for
me said grandma and unstrapping the sausage she took it out and
wound it round her head the fringe of grey bobbles danced at her
eyebrows as she smiled tenderly and mournfully at Fenella Then
she undid her bodice and something under that and something else
underneath that Then there seemed a short sharp tussle and grandma
flushed faintly Snip Snap She had undone her stays She breathed a
sigh of relief and sitting on the plush couch she slowly and carefully
pulled off her elasticsided boots and stood them side by side

By the time Fenella had taken off her coat and skirt and put on her
flannel dressinggown grandma was quite ready

Must I take off my boots grandma Theyre lace

Grandma gave them a moments deep consideration Youd feel a great
deal more comfortable if you did child said she She kissed Fenella
Dont forget to say your prayers Our dear Lord is with us when we
are at sea even more than when we are on dry land And because I am an
experienced traveller said grandma briskly I shall take the upper
berth

But grandma however will you get up there

Three little spiderlike steps were all Fenella saw The old woman gave
a small silent laugh before she mounted them nimbly and she peered over
the high bunk at the astonished Fenella

You didnt think your grandma could do that did you said she And as
she sank back Fenella heard her light laugh again

The hard square of brown soap would not lather and the water in the
bottle was like a kind of blue jelly How hard it was too to turn down
those stiff sheets you simply had to tear your way in If everything
had been different Fenella might have got the giggles At last she
was inside and while she lay there panting there sounded from above
a long soft whispering as though some one was gently gently rustling
among tissue paper to find something It was grandma saying her
prayers

A long time passed Then the stewardess came in she trod softly and
leaned her hand on grandmas bunk

Were just entering the Straits she said

Oh

Its a fine night but were rather empty We may pitch a little

And indeed at that moment the Picton Boat rose and rose and hung in the
air just long enough to give a shiver before she swung down again and
there was the sound of heavy water slapping against her sides Fenella
remembered she had left the swannecked umbrella standing up on the
little couch If it fell over would it break But grandma remembered
too at the same time

I wonder if youd mind stewardess laying down my umbrella she
whispered

Not at all Mrs Crane And the stewardess coming back to grandma
breathed Your little granddaughters in such a beautiful sleep

God be praised for that said grandma

Poor little motherless mite said the stewardess And grandma was
still telling the stewardess all about what happened when Fenella fell
asleep

But she hadnt been asleep long enough to dream before she woke up again
to see something waving in the air above her head What was it What
could it be It was a small grey foot Now another joined it They
seemed to be feeling about for something there came a sigh

Im awake grandma said Fenella

Oh dear am I near the ladder asked grandma I thought it was this
end

No grandma its the other Ill put your foot on it Are we there
asked Fenella

In the harbour said grandma We must get up child Youd better
have a biscuit to steady yourself before you move

But Fenella had hopped out of her bunk The lamp was still burning
but night was over and it was cold Peering through that round eye she
could see far off some rocks Now they were scattered over with foam
now a gull flipped by and now there came a long piece of real land

Its land grandma said Fenella wonderingly as though they had been
at sea for weeks together She hugged herself she stood on one leg and
rubbed it with the toes of the other foot she was trembling Oh it had
all been so sad lately Was it going to change But all her grandma
said was Make haste child I should leave your nice banana for
the stewardess as you havent eaten it And Fenella put on her black
clothes again and a button sprang off one of her gloves and rolled to
where she couldnt reach it They went up on deck

But if it had been cold in the cabin on deck it was like ice The sun
was not up yet but the stars were dim and the cold pale sky was the
same colour as the cold pale sea On the land a white mist rose and
fell Now they could see quite plainly dark bush Even the shapes of the
umbrella ferns showed and those strange silvery withered trees that are
like skeletons Now they could see the landingstage and some little
houses pale too clustered together like shells on the lid of a box
The other passengers tramped up and down but more slowly than they had
the night before and they looked gloomy

And now the landingstage came out to meet them Slowly it swam towards
the Picton boat and a man holding a coil of rope and a cart with a
small drooping horse and another man sitting on the step came too

Its Mr Penreddy Fenella come for us said grandma She sounded
pleased Her white waxen cheeks were blue with cold her chin trembled
and she had to keep wiping her eyes and her little pink nose

Youve got my

Yes grandma Fenella showed it to her

The rope came flying through the air and smack it fell on to the
deck The gangway was lowered Again Fenella followed her grandma on to
the wharf over to the little cart and a moment later they were bowling
away The hooves of the little horse drummed over the wooden piles then
sank softly into the sandy road Not a soul was to be seen there was
not even a feather of smoke The mist rose and fell and the sea still
sounded asleep as slowly it turned on the beach

I seen Mr Crane yestiddy said Mr Penreddy He looked himself then
Missus knocked him up a batch of scones last week

And now the little horse pulled up before one of the shelllike houses
They got down Fenella put her hand on the gate and the big trembling
dewdrops soaked through her glovetips Up a little path of round
white pebbles they went with drenched sleeping flowers on either side
Grandmas delicate white picotees were so heavy with dew that they were
fallen but their sweet smell was part of the cold morning The blinds
were down in the little house they mounted the steps on to the veranda
A pair of old bluchers was on one side of the door and a large red
wateringcan on the other

Tut tut Your grandpa said grandma She turned the handle Not a
sound She called Walter And immediately a deep voice that sounded
half stifled called back Is that you Mary

Wait dear said grandma Go in there She pushed Fenella gently
into a small dusky sittingroom

On the table a white cat that had been folded up like a camel rose
stretched itself yawned and then sprang on to the tips of its toes
Fenella buried one cold little hand in the white warm fur and smiled
timidly while she stroked and listened to grandmas gentle voice and the
rolling tones of grandpa

A door creaked Come in dear The old woman beckoned Fenella
followed There lying to one side on an immense bed lay grandpa
Just his head with a white tuft and his rosy face and long silver beard
showed over the quilt He was like a very old wideawake bird

Well my girl said grandpa Give us a kiss Fenella kissed him
Ugh said grandpa Her little nose is as cold as a button Whats
that shes holding Her grandmas umbrella

Fenella smiled again and crooked the swan neck over the bedrail Above
the bed there was a big text in a deep black frame

 Lost One Golden Hour
 Set with Sixty Diamond Minutes
 No Reward Is Offered
 For It Is Gone For Ever

Yer grandma painted that said grandpa And he ruffled his white tuft
and looked at Fenella so merrily she almost thought he winked at her




9 MISS BRILL

Although it was so brilliantly finethe blue sky powdered with gold
and great spots of light like white wine splashed over the Jardins
PubliquesMiss Brill was glad that she had decided on her fur The air
was motionless but when you opened your mouth there was just a faint
chill like a chill from a glass of iced water before you sip and now
and again a leaf came driftingfrom nowhere from the sky Miss Brill
put up her hand and touched her fur Dear little thing It was nice to
feel it again She had taken it out of its box that afternoon shaken
out the mothpowder given it a good brush and rubbed the life back
into the dim little eyes What has been happening to me said the sad
little eyes Oh how sweet it was to see them snap at her again from
the red eiderdown But the nose which was of some black composition
wasnt at all firm It must have had a knock somehow Never minda
little dab of black sealingwax when the time camewhen it was
absolutely necessary Little rogue Yes she really felt like that
about it Little rogue biting its tail just by her left ear She could
have taken it off and laid it on her lap and stroked it She felt
a tingling in her hands and arms but that came from walking she
supposed And when she breathed something light and sadno not sad
exactlysomething gentle seemed to move in her bosom

There were a number of people out this afternoon far more than last
Sunday And the band sounded louder and gayer That was because the
Season had begun For although the band played all the year round on
Sundays out of season it was never the same It was like some one
playing with only the family to listen it didnt care how it played if
there werent any strangers present Wasnt the conductor wearing a new
coat too She was sure it was new He scraped with his foot and flapped
his arms like a rooster about to crow and the bandsmen sitting in the
green rotunda blew out their cheeks and glared at the music Now there
came a little flutey bitvery prettya little chain of bright
drops She was sure it would be repeated It was she lifted her head
and smiled

Only two people shared her special seat a fine old man in a velvet
coat his hands clasped over a huge carved walkingstick and a big
old woman sitting upright with a roll of knitting on her embroidered
apron They did not speak This was disappointing for Miss Brill always
looked forward to the conversation She had become really quite expert
she thought at listening as though she didnt listen at sitting in
other peoples lives just for a minute while they talked round her

She glanced sideways at the old couple Perhaps they would go soon
Last Sunday too hadnt been as interesting as usual An Englishman
and his wife he wearing a dreadful Panama hat and she button boots And
shed gone on the whole time about how she ought to wear spectacles
she knew she needed them but that it was no good getting any theyd be
sure to break and theyd never keep on And hed been so patient Hed
suggested everythinggold rims the kind that curved round your ears
little pads inside the bridge No nothing would please her Theyll
always be sliding down my nose Miss Brill had wanted to shake her

The old people sat on the bench still as statues Never mind there was
always the crowd to watch To and fro in front of the flowerbeds and
the band rotunda the couples and groups paraded stopped to talk to
greet to buy a handful of flowers from the old beggar who had his tray
fixed to the railings Little children ran among them swooping and
laughing little boys with big white silk bows under their chins little
girls little French dolls dressed up in velvet and lace And sometimes
a tiny staggerer came suddenly rocking into the open from under the
trees stopped stared as suddenly sat down flop until its small
highstepping mother like a young hen rushed scolding to its rescue
Other people sat on the benches and green chairs but they were
nearly always the same Sunday after Sunday andMiss Brill had often
noticedthere was something funny about nearly all of them They were
odd silent nearly all old and from the way they stared they looked as
though theyd just come from dark little rooms or eveneven cupboards

Behind the rotunda the slender trees with yellow leaves down drooping
and through them just a line of sea and beyond the blue sky with
goldveined clouds

Tumtumtum tiddleum tiddleum tum tiddleyum tum ta blew the band

Two young girls in red came by and two young soldiers in blue met them
and they laughed and paired and went off arminarm Two peasant women
with funny straw hats passed gravely leading beautiful smokecoloured
donkeys A cold pale nun hurried by A beautiful woman came along and
dropped her bunch of violets and a little boy ran after to hand them to
her and she took them and threw them away as if theyd been poisoned
Dear me Miss Brill didnt know whether to admire that or not And now
an ermine toque and a gentleman in grey met just in front of her He
was tall stiff dignified and she was wearing the ermine toque shed
bought when her hair was yellow Now everything her hair her face
even her eyes was the same colour as the shabby ermine and her hand
in its cleaned glove lifted to dab her lips was a tiny yellowish paw
Oh she was so pleased to see himdelighted She rather thought
they were going to meet that afternoon She described where shed
beeneverywhere here there along by the sea The day was so
charmingdidnt he agree And wouldnt he perhaps But he shook his
head lighted a cigarette slowly breathed a great deep puff into her
face and even while she was still talking and laughing flicked the
match away and walked on The ermine toque was alone she smiled more
brightly than ever But even the band seemed to know what she was
feeling and played more softly played tenderly and the drum beat The
Brute The Brute over and over What would she do What was going to
happen now But as Miss Brill wondered the ermine toque turned raised
her hand as though shed seen some one else much nicer just over
there and pattered away And the band changed again and played more
quickly more gayly than ever and the old couple on Miss Brills seat
got up and marched away and such a funny old man with long whiskers
hobbled along in time to the music and was nearly knocked over by four
girls walking abreast

Oh how fascinating it was How she enjoyed it How she loved sitting
here watching it all It was like a play It was exactly like a play
Who could believe the sky at the back wasnt painted But it wasnt till
a little brown dog trotted on solemn and then slowly trotted off like
a little theatre dog a little dog that had been drugged that Miss
Brill discovered what it was that made it so exciting They were all
on the stage They werent only the audience not only looking on
they were acting Even she had a part and came every Sunday No doubt
somebody would have noticed if she hadnt been there she was part of
the performance after all How strange shed never thought of it like
that before And yet it explained why she made such a point of starting
from home at just the same time each weekso as not to be late for
the performanceand it also explained why she had quite a queer
shy feeling at telling her English pupils how she spent her Sunday
afternoons No wonder Miss Brill nearly laughed out loud She was on
the stage She thought of the old invalid gentleman to whom she read the
newspaper four afternoons a week while he slept in the garden She had
got quite used to the frail head on the cotton pillow the hollowed
eyes the open mouth and the high pinched nose If hed been dead she
mightnt have noticed for weeks she wouldnt have minded But suddenly
he knew he was having the paper read to him by an actress An actress
The old head lifted two points of light quivered in the old eyes An
actressare ye And Miss Brill smoothed the newspaper as though it
were the manuscript of her part and said gently Yes I have been an
actress for a long time

The band had been having a rest Now they started again And what they
played was warm sunny yet there was just a faint chilla something
what was itnot sadnessno not sadnessa something that made you
want to sing The tune lifted lifted the light shone and it seemed
to Miss Brill that in another moment all of them all the whole company
would begin singing The young ones the laughing ones who were moving
together they would begin and the mens voices very resolute and
brave would join them And then she too she too and the others on the
benchesthey would come in with a kind of accompanimentsomething low
that scarcely rose or fell something so beautifulmoving And Miss
Brills eyes filled with tears and she looked smiling at all the
other members of the company Yes we understand we understand she
thoughtthough what they understood she didnt know

Just at that moment a boy and girl came and sat down where the old
couple had been They were beautifully dressed they were in love The
hero and heroine of course just arrived from his fathers yacht And
still soundlessly singing still with that trembling smile Miss Brill
prepared to listen

No not now said the girl Not here I cant

But why Because of that stupid old thing at the end there asked the
boy Why does she come here at allwho wants her Why doesnt she keep
her silly old mug at home

Its her fuur which is so funny giggled the girl Its exactly like
a fried whiting

Ah be off with you said the boy in an angry whisper Then Tell me
ma petite chere

No not here said the girl Not yet



On her way home she usually bought a slice of honeycake at the bakers
It was her Sunday treat Sometimes there was an almond in her slice
sometimes not It made a great difference If there was an almond it was
like carrying home a tiny presenta surprisesomething that might very
well not have been there She hurried on the almond Sundays and struck
the match for the kettle in quite a dashing way

But today she passed the bakers by climbed the stairs went into
the little dark roomher room like a cupboardand sat down on the red
eiderdown She sat there for a long time The box that the fur came out
of was on the bed She unclasped the necklet quickly quickly without
looking laid it inside But when she put the lid on she thought she
heard something crying




10 HER FIRST BALL

Exactly when the ball began Leila would have found it hard to say
Perhaps her first real partner was the cab It did not matter that she
shared the cab with the Sheridan girls and their brother She sat back
in her own little corner of it and the bolster on which her hand rested
felt like the sleeve of an unknown young mans dress suit and away they
bowled past waltzing lampposts and houses and fences and trees

Have you really never been to a ball before Leila But my child how
too weird cried the Sheridan girls

Our nearest neighbour was fifteen miles said Leila softly gently
opening and shutting her fan

Oh dear how hard it was to be indifferent like the others She tried
not to smile too much she tried not to care But every single thing
was so new and exciting Megs tuberoses Joses long loop of amber
Lauras little dark head pushing above her white fur like a flower
through snow She would remember for ever It even gave her a pang to
see her cousin Laurie throw away the wisps of tissue paper he pulled
from the fastenings of his new gloves She would like to have kept those
wisps as a keepsake as a remembrance Laurie leaned forward and put his
hand on Lauras knee

Look here darling he said The third and the ninth as usual Twig

Oh how marvellous to have a brother In her excitement Leila felt that
if there had been time if it hadnt been impossible she couldnt have
helped crying because she was an only child and no brother had ever
said Twig to her no sister would ever say as Meg said to Jose that
moment Ive never known your hair go up more successfully than it has
tonight

But of course there was no time They were at the drill hall already
there were cabs in front of them and cabs behind The road was bright on
either side with moving fanlike lights and on the pavement gay couples
seemed to float through the air little satin shoes chased each other
like birds

Hold on to me Leila youll get lost said Laura

Come on girls lets make a dash for it said Laurie

Leila put two fingers on Lauras pink velvet cloak and they were
somehow lifted past the big golden lantern carried along the passage
and pushed into the little room marked Ladies Here the crowd was so
great there was hardly space to take off their things the noise was
deafening Two benches on either side were stacked high with wraps Two
old women in white aprons ran up and down tossing fresh armfuls
And everybody was pressing forward trying to get at the little
dressingtable and mirror at the far end

A great quivering jet of gas lighted the ladies room It couldnt wait
it was dancing already When the door opened again and there came a
burst of tuning from the drill hall it leaped almost to the ceiling

Dark girls fair girls were patting their hair tying ribbons again
tucking handkerchiefs down the fronts of their bodices smoothing
marblewhite gloves And because they were all laughing it seemed to
Leila that they were all lovely

Arent there any invisible hairpins cried a voice How most
extraordinary I cant see a single invisible hairpin

Powder my back theres a darling cried some one else

But I must have a needle and cotton Ive torn simply miles and miles
of the frill wailed a third

Then Pass them along pass them along The straw basket of programmes
was tossed from arm to arm Darling little pinkandsilver programmes
with pink pencils and fluffy tassels Leilas fingers shook as she took
one out of the basket She wanted to ask some one Am I meant to
have one too but she had just time to read Waltz 3 Two Two in
a Canoe Polka 4 Making the Feathers Fly when Meg cried Ready
Leila and they pressed their way through the crush in the passage
towards the big double doors of the drill hall

Dancing had not begun yet but the band had stopped tuning and the
noise was so great it seemed that when it did begin to play it would
never be heard Leila pressing close to Meg looking over Megs
shoulder felt that even the little quivering coloured flags strung
across the ceiling were talking She quite forgot to be shy she forgot
how in the middle of dressing she had sat down on the bed with one shoe
off and one shoe on and begged her mother to ring up her cousins and
say she couldnt go after all And the rush of longing she had had to be
sitting on the veranda of their forsaken upcountry home listening to
the baby owls crying More pork in the moonlight was changed to a rush
of joy so sweet that it was hard to bear alone She clutched her fan
and gazing at the gleaming golden floor the azaleas the lanterns
the stage at one end with its red carpet and gilt chairs and the band in
a corner she thought breathlessly How heavenly how simply heavenly

All the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors the
men at the other and the chaperones in dark dresses smiling rather
foolishly walked with little careful steps over the polished floor
towards the stage

This is my little country cousin Leila Be nice to her Find her
partners shes under my wing said Meg going up to one girl after
another

Strange faces smiled at Leilasweetly vaguely Strange voices
answered Of course my dear But Leila felt the girls didnt really
see her They were looking towards the men Why didnt the men begin
What were they waiting for There they stood smoothing their gloves
patting their glossy hair and smiling among themselves Then quite
suddenly as if they had only just made up their minds that that was
what they had to do the men came gliding over the parquet There was a
joyful flutter among the girls A tall fair man flew up to Meg seized
her programme scribbled something Meg passed him on to Leila May I
have the pleasure He ducked and smiled There came a dark man wearing
an eyeglass then cousin Laurie with a friend and Laura with a little
freckled fellow whose tie was crooked Then quite an old manfat with
a big bald patch on his headtook her programme and murmured Let me
see let me see And he was a long time comparing his programme
which looked black with names with hers It seemed to give him so much
trouble that Leila was ashamed Oh please dont bother she said
eagerly But instead of replying the fat man wrote something glanced at
her again Do I remember this bright little face he said softly Is
it known to me of yore At that moment the band began playing the fat
man disappeared He was tossed away on a great wave of music that came
flying over the gleaming floor breaking the groups up into couples
scattering them sending them spinning

Leila had learned to dance at boarding school Every Saturday afternoon
the boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission
hall where Miss Eccles of London held her select classes But the
difference between that dustysmelling hallwith calico texts on the
walls the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with
rabbits ears thumping the cold piano Miss Eccles poking the girls
feet with her long white wandand this was so tremendous that Leila was
sure if her partner didnt come and she had to listen to that marvellous
music and to watch the others sliding gliding over the golden floor
she would die at least or faint or lift her arms and fly out of one of
those dark windows that showed the stars

Ours I think Some one bowed smiled and offered her his arm she
hadnt to die after all Some ones hand pressed her waist and she
floated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool

Quite a good floor isnt it drawled a faint voice close to her ear

I think its most beautifully slippery said Leila

Pardon The faint voice sounded surprised Leila said it again And
there was a tiny pause before the voice echoed Oh quite and she was
swung round again

He steered so beautifully That was the great difference between dancing
with girls and men Leila decided Girls banged into each other and
stamped on each others feet the girl who was gentleman always clutched
you so

The azaleas were separate flowers no longer they were pink and white
flags streaming by

Were you at the Bells last week the voice came again It sounded
tired Leila wondered whether she ought to ask him if he would like to
stop

No this is my first dance said she

Her partner gave a little gasping laugh Oh I say he protested

Yes it is really the first dance Ive ever been to Leila was most
fervent It was such a relief to be able to tell somebody You see
Ive lived in the country all my life up till now 

At that moment the music stopped and they went to sit on two chairs
against the wall Leila tucked her pink satin feet under and fanned
herself while she blissfully watched the other couples passing and
disappearing through the swing doors

Enjoying yourself Leila asked Jose nodding her golden head

Laura passed and gave her the faintest little wink it made Leila wonder
for a moment whether she was quite grown up after all Certainly her
partner did not say very much He coughed tucked his handkerchief away
pulled down his waistcoat took a minute thread off his sleeve But
it didnt matter Almost immediately the band started and her second
partner seemed to spring from the ceiling

Floors not bad said the new voice Did one always begin with the
floor And then Were you at the Neaves on Tuesday And again Leila
explained Perhaps it was a little strange that her partners were not
more interested For it was thrilling Her first ball She was only at
the beginning of everything It seemed to her that she had never known
what the night was like before Up till now it had been dark silent
beautiful very oftenoh yesbut mournful somehow Solemn And now it
would never be like that againit had opened dazzling bright

Care for an ice said her partner And they went through the swing
doors down the passage to the supper room Her cheeks burned she was
fearfully thirsty How sweet the ices looked on little glass plates and
how cold the frosted spoon was iced too And when they came back to
the hall there was the fat man waiting for her by the door It gave her
quite a shock again to see how old he was he ought to have been on the
stage with the fathers and mothers And when Leila compared him with her
other partners he looked shabby His waistcoat was creased there was
a button off his glove his coat looked as if it was dusty with French
chalk

Come along little lady said the fat man He scarcely troubled to
clasp her and they moved away so gently it was more like walking than
dancing But he said not a word about the floor Your first dance
isnt it he murmured

How did you know

Ah said the fat man thats what it is to be old He wheezed
faintly as he steered her past an awkward couple You see Ive been
doing this kind of thing for the last thirty years

Thirty years cried Leila Twelve years before she was born

It hardly bears thinking about does it said the fat man gloomily
Leila looked at his bald head and she felt quite sorry for him

I think its marvellous to be still going on she said kindly

Kind little lady said the fat man and he pressed her a little
closer and hummed a bar of the waltz Of course he said you cant
hope to last anything like as long as that Noo said the fat man
long before that youll be sitting up there on the stage looking on
in your nice black velvet And these pretty arms will have turned into
little short fat ones and youll beat time with such a different kind
of fana black bony one The fat man seemed to shudder And youll
smile away like the poor old dears up there and point to your daughter
and tell the elderly lady next to you how some dreadful man tried to
kiss her at the club ball And your heart will ache achethe fat
man squeezed her closer still as if he really was sorry for that
poor heartbecause no one wants to kiss you now And youll say how
unpleasant these polished floors are to walk on how dangerous they are
Eh Mademoiselle Twinkletoes said the fat man softly

Leila gave a light little laugh but she did not feel like laughing Was
itcould it all be true It sounded terribly true Was this first ball
only the beginning of her last ball after all At that the music seemed
to change it sounded sad sad it rose upon a great sigh Oh how
quickly things changed Why didnt happiness last for ever For ever
wasnt a bit too long

I want to stop she said in a breathless voice The fat man led her to
the door

No she said I wont go outside I wont sit down Ill just stand
here thank you She leaned against the wall tapping with her foot
pulling up her gloves and trying to smile But deep inside her a little
girl threw her pinafore over her head and sobbed Why had he spoiled it
all

I say you know said the fat man you mustnt take me seriously
little lady

As if I should said Leila tossing her small dark head and sucking
her underlip

Again the couples paraded The swing doors opened and shut Now new
music was given out by the bandmaster But Leila didnt want to dance
any more She wanted to be home or sitting on the veranda listening to
those baby owls When she looked through the dark windows at the stars
they had long beams like wings

But presently a soft melting ravishing tune began and a young man
with curly hair bowed before her She would have to dance out of
politeness until she could find Meg Very stiffly she walked into
the middle very haughtily she put her hand on his sleeve But in one
minute in one turn her feet glided glided The lights the azaleas
the dresses the pink faces the velvet chairs all became one beautiful
flying wheel And when her next partner bumped her into the fat man
and he said Pardon she smiled at him more radiantly than ever She
didnt even recognise him again




11 THE SINGING LESSON

With despaircold sharp despairburied deep in her heart like a
wicked knife Miss Meadows in cap and gown and carrying a little baton
trod the cold corridors that led to the music hall Girls of all ages
rosy from the air and bubbling over with that gleeful excitement that
comes from running to school on a fine autumn morning hurried skipped
fluttered by from the hollow classrooms came a quick drumming of
voices a bell rang a voice like a bird cried Muriel And then there
came from the staircase a tremendous knockknockknocking Some one had
dropped her dumbbells

The Science Mistress stopped Miss Meadows

Good morning she cried in her sweet affected drawl Isnt it
cold It might be winter

Miss Meadows hugging the knife stared in hatred at the Science
Mistress Everything about her was sweet pale like honey You wold not
have been surprised to see a bee caught in the tangles of that yellow
hair

It is rather sharp said Miss Meadows grimly

The other smiled her sugary smile

You look frozen said she Her blue eyes opened wide there came a
mocking light in them Had she noticed anything

Oh not quite as bad as that said Miss Meadows and she gave the
Science Mistress in exchange for her smile a quick grimace and passed
on

Forms Four Five and Six were assembled in the music hall The noise
was deafening On the platform by the piano stood Mary Beazley Miss
Meadows favourite who played accompaniments She was turning the
music stool When she saw Miss Meadows she gave a loud warning Shsh
girls and Miss Meadows her hands thrust in her sleeves the baton
under her arm strode down the centre aisle mounted the steps turned
sharply seized the brass music stand planted it in front of her and
gave two sharp taps with her baton for silence

Silence please Immediately and looking at nobody her glance swept
over that sea of coloured flannel blouses with bobbing pink faces and
hands quivering butterfly hairbows and musicbooks outspread She
knew perfectly well what they were thinking Meady is in a wax Well
let them think it Her eyelids quivered she tossed her head defying
them What could the thoughts of those creatures matter to some one who
stood there bleeding to death pierced to the heart to the heart by
such a letter

 I feel more and more strongly that our marriage would be a mistake
Not that I do not love you I love you as much as it is possible for
me to love any woman but truth to tell I have come to the conclusion
that I am not a marrying man and the idea of settling down fills me
with nothing but and the word disgust was scratched out lightly and
regret written over the top

Basil Miss Meadows stalked over to the piano And Mary Beazley who was
waiting for this moment bent forward her curls fell over her cheeks
while she breathed Good morning Miss Meadows and she motioned
towards rather than handed to her mistress a beautiful yellow
chrysanthemum This little ritual of the flower had been gone through
for ages and ages quite a term and a half It was as much part of the
lesson as opening the piano But this morning instead of taking it up
instead of tucking it into her belt while she leant over Mary and said
Thank you Mary How very nice Turn to page thirtytwo what was
Marys horror when Miss Meadows totally ignored the chrysanthemum made
no reply to her greeting but said in a voice of ice Page fourteen
please and mark the accents well

Staggering moment Mary blushed until the tears stood in her eyes but
Miss Meadows was gone back to the music stand her voice rang through
the music hall

Page fourteen We will begin with page fourteen A Lament Now
girls you ought to know it by this time We shall take it all together
not in parts all together And without expression Sing it though
quite simply beating time with the left hand

She raised the baton she tapped the music stand twice Down came Mary
on the opening chord down came all those left hands beating the air
and in chimed those young mournful voices

 Fast Ah too Fast Fade the Rooses of Pleasure
 Soon Autumn yields unto Wiinter Drear
 Fleetly Ah Fleetly Muusics Gay Measure
 Passes away from the Listening Ear

Good Heavens what could be more tragic than that lament Every note was
a sigh a sob a groan of awful mournfulness Miss Meadows lifted her
arms in the wide gown and began conducting with both hands  I feel
more and more strongly that our marriage would be a mistake  she
beat And the voices cried Fleetly Ah Fleetly What could have
possessed him to write such a letter What could have led up to it
It came out of nothing His last letter had been all about a fumedoak
bookcase he had bought for our books and a natty little hallstand
he had seen a very neat affair with a carved owl on a bracket holding
three hatbrushes in its claws How she had smiled at that So like
a man to think one needed three hatbrushes From the Listening Ear
sang the voices

Once again said Miss Meadows But this time in parts Still without
expression Fast Ah too Fast With the gloom of the contraltos
added one could scarcely help shuddering Fade the Roses of Pleasure
Last time he had come to see her Basil had worn a rose in his
buttonhole How handsome he had looked in that bright blue suit with
that dark red rose And he knew it too He couldnt help knowing it
First he stroked his hair then his moustache his teeth gleamed when he
smiled

The headmasters wife keeps on asking me to dinner Its a perfect
nuisance I never get an evening to myself in that place

But cant you refuse

Oh well it doesnt do for a man in my position to be unpopular

Musics Gay Measure wailed the voices The willow trees outside
the high narrow windows waved in the wind They had lost half their
leaves The tiny ones that clung wriggled like fishes caught on a
line  I am not a marrying man  The voices were silent the piano
waited

Quite good said Miss Meadows but still in such a strange stony tone
that the younger girls began to feel positively frightened But now
that we know it we shall take it with expression As much expression as
you can put into it Think of the words girls Use your imaginations
Fast Ah too Fast cried Miss Meadows That ought to break outa
loud strong fortea lament And then in the second line Winter
Drear make that Drear sound as if a cold wind were blowing through
it Dreear said she so awfully that Mary Beazley on the music
stool wriggled her spine The third line should be one crescendo
Fleetly Ah Fleetly Musics Gay Measure Breaking on the first word
of the last line Passes And then on the word Away you must begin
to die to fade until The Listening Ear is nothing more than a
faint whisper You can slow down as much as you like almost on the last
line Now please

Again the two light taps she lifted her arms again Fast Ah too
Fast  and the idea of settling down fills me with nothing but
disgust Disgust was what he had written That was as good as to
say their engagement was definitely broken off Broken off Their
engagement People had been surprised enough that she had got engaged
The Science Mistress would not believe it at first But nobody had been
as surprised as she She was thirty Basil was twentyfive It had been
a miracle simply a miracle to hear him say as they walked home from
church that very dark night You know somehow or other Ive got fond
of you And he had taken hold of the end of her ostrich feather boa
Passes away from the Listening Ear

Repeat Repeat said Miss Meadows More expression girls Once
more

Fast Ah too Fast The older girls were crimson some of the younger
ones began to cry Big spots of rain blew against the windows and one
could hear the willows whispering  not that I do not love you 

But my darling if you love me thought Miss Meadows I dont mind
how much it is Love me as little as you like But she knew he didnt
love her Not to have cared enough to scratch out that word disgust
so that she couldnt read it Soon Autumn yields unto Winter Drear
She would have to leave the school too She could never face the
Science Mistress or the girls after it got known She would have to
disappear somewhere Passes away The voices began to die to fade to
whisper to vanish

Suddenly the door opened A little girl in blue walked fussily up the
aisle hanging her head biting her lips and twisting the silver bangle
on her red little wrist She came up the steps and stood before Miss
Meadows

Well Monica what is it

Oh if you please Miss Meadows said the little girl gasping Miss
Wyatt wants to see you in the mistresss room

Very well said Miss Meadows And she called to the girls I shall
put you on your honour to talk quietly while I am away But they were
too subdued to do anything else Most of them were blowing their noses

The corridors were silent and cold they echoed to Miss Meadows steps
The head mistress sat at her desk For a moment she did not look up She
was as usual disentangling her eyeglasses which had got caught in her
lace tie Sit down Miss Meadows she said very kindly And then she
picked up a pink envelope from the blottingpad I sent for you just
now because this telegram has come for you

A telegram for me Miss Wyatt

Basil He had committed suicide decided Miss Meadows Her hand flew
out but Miss Wyatt held the telegram back a moment I hope its not
bad news she said so more than kindly And Miss Meadows tore it open

Pay no attention to letter must have been mad bought hatstand
todayBasil she read She couldnt take her eyes off the telegram

I do hope its nothing very serious said Miss Wyatt leaning forward

Oh no thank you Miss Wyatt blushed Miss Meadows Its nothing bad
at all Itsand she gave an apologetic little laughits from my
fiance saying that saying that There was a pause I see said
Miss Wyatt And another pause ThenYouve fifteen minutes more of
your class Miss Meadows havent you

Yes Miss Wyatt She got up She half ran towards the door

Oh just one minute Miss Meadows said Miss Wyatt I must say I
dont approve of my teachers having telegrams sent to them in school
hours unless in case of very bad news such as death explained Miss
Wyatt or a very serious accident or something to that effect Good
news Miss Meadows will always keep you know

On the wings of hope of love of joy Miss Meadows sped back to the
music hall up the aisle up the steps over to the piano

Page thirtytwo Mary she said page thirtytwo and picking up
the yellow chrysanthemum she held it to her lips to hide her smile
Then she turned to the girls rapped with her baton Page thirtytwo
girls Page thirtytwo

 We come here Today with Flowers oerladen
 With Baskets of Fruit and Ribbons to boot
 Tooo Congratulate

Stop Stop cried Miss Meadows This is awful This is dreadful And
she beamed at her girls Whats the matter with you all Think girls
think of what youre singing Use your imaginations With Flowers
oerladen Baskets of Fruit and Ribbons to boot And Congratulate
Miss Meadows broke off Dont look so doleful girls It ought to sound
warm joyful eager Congratulate Once more Quickly All together
Now then

And this time Miss Meadows voice sounded over all the other
voicesfull deep glowing with expression




12 THE STRANGER

It seemed to the little crowd on the wharf that she was never going
to move again There she lay immense motionless on the grey crinkled
water a loop of smoke above her an immense flock of gulls screaming
and diving after the galley droppings at the stern You could just see
little couples paradinglittle flies walking up and down the dish on
the grey crinkled tablecloth Other flies clustered and swarmed at the
edge Now there was a gleam of white on the lower deckthe cooks apron
or the stewardess perhaps Now a tiny black spider raced up the ladder
on to the bridge

In the front of the crowd a stronglooking middleaged man dressed
very well very snugly in a grey overcoat grey silk scarf thick gloves
and dark felt hat marched up and down twirling his folded umbrella He
seemed to be the leader of the little crowd on the wharf and at the same
time to keep them together He was something between the sheepdog and
the shepherd

But what a foolwhat a fool he had been not to bring any glasses There
wasnt a pair of glasses between the whole lot of them

Curious thing Mr Scott that none of us thought of glasses We might
have been able to stir em up a bit We might have managed a little
signalling Dont hesitate to land Natives harmless Or A welcome
awaits you All is forgiven What Eh

Mr Hammonds quick eager glance so nervous and yet so friendly and
confiding took in everybody on the wharf roped in even those old chaps
lounging against the gangways They knew every manjack of them that
Mrs Hammond was on that boat and that he was so tremendously excited
it never entered his head not to believe that this marvellous fact meant
something to them too It warmed his heart towards them They were
he decided as decent a crowd of peopleThose old chaps over by the
gangways toofine solid old chaps What chestsby Jove And he
squared his own plunged his thickgloved hands into his pockets rocked
from heel to toe

Yes my wifes been in Europe for the last ten months On a visit to
our eldest girl who was married last year I brought her up here as
far as Salisbury myself So I thought Id better come and fetch her
back Yes yes yes The shrewd grey eyes narrowed again and searched
anxiously quickly the motionless liner Again his overcoat was
unbuttoned Out came the thin butteryellow watch again and for the
twentiethfiftiethhundredth time he made the calculation

Let me see now It was two fifteen when the doctors launch went off
Two fifteen It is now exactly twentyeight minutes past four That is
to say the doctors been gone two hours and thirteen minutes Two hours
and thirteen minutes Wheeooh He gave a queer little halfwhistle
and snapped his watch to again But I think we should have been told if
there was anything updont you Mr Gaven

Oh yes Mr Hammond I dont think theres anything toanything to
worry about said Mr Gaven knocking out his pipe against the heel of
his shoe At the same time

Quite so Quite so cried Mr Hammond Dashed annoying He paced
quickly up and down and came back again to his stand between Mr and
Mrs Scott and Mr Gaven Its getting quite dark too and he waved
his folded umbrella as though the dusk at least might have had the
decency to keep off for a bit But the dusk came slowly spreading like
a slow stain over the water Little Jean Scott dragged at her mothers
hand

I wan my tea mammy she wailed

I expect you do said Mr Hammond I expect all these ladies want
their tea And his kind flushed almost pitiful glance roped them all
in again He wondered whether Janey was having a final cup of tea in the
saloon out there He hoped so he thought not It would be just like her
not to leave the deck In that case perhaps the deck steward would bring
her up a cup If hed been there hed have got it for hersomehow And
for a moment he was on deck standing over her watching her little hand
fold round the cup in the way she had while she drank the only cup of
tea to be got on board But now he was back here and the Lord only
knew when that cursed Captain would stop hanging about in the stream
He took another turn up and down up and down He walked as far as the
cabstand to make sure his driver hadnt disappeared back he swerved
again to the little flock huddled in the shelter of the banana crates
Little Jean Scott was still wanting her tea Poor little beggar He
wished he had a bit of chocolate on him

Here Jean he said Like a lift up And easily gently he swung
the little girl on to a higher barrel The movement of holding her
steadying her relieved him wonderfully lightened his heart

Hold on he said keeping an arm round her

Oh dont worry about Jean Mr Hammond said Mrs Scott

Thats all right Mrs Scott No trouble Its a pleasure Jeans a
little pal of mine arent you Jean

Yes Mr Hammond said Jean and she ran her finger down the dent of
his felt hat

But suddenly she caught him by the ear and gave a loud scream Look
Mr Hammond Shes moving Look shes coming in

By Jove So she was At last She was slowly slowly turning round A
bell sounded far over the water and a great spout of steam gushed into
the air The gulls rose they fluttered away like bits of white paper
And whether that deep throbbing was her engines or his heart Mr Hammond
couldnt say He had to nerve himself to bear it whatever it was At
that moment old Captain Johnson the harbourmaster came striding down
the wharf a leather portfolio under his arm

Jeanll be all right said Mr Scott Ill hold her He was just in
time Mr Hammond had forgotten about Jean He sprang away to greet old
Captain Johnson

Well Captain the eager nervous voice rang out again youve taken
pity on us at last

Its no good blaming me Mr Hammond wheezed old Captain Johnson
staring at the liner You got Mrs Hammond on board aint yer

Yes yes said Hammond and he kept by the harbourmasters side
Mrs Hammonds there Hullo We shant be long now

With her telephone ringringing the thrum of her screw filling the air
the big liner bore down on them cutting sharp through the dark water
so that big white shavings curled to either side Hammond and the
harbourmaster kept in front of the rest Hammond took off his hat he
raked the decksthey were crammed with passengers he waved his hat and
bawled a loud strange Hullo across the water and then turned
round and burst out laughing and said somethingnothingto old Captain
Johnson

Seen her asked the harbourmaster

No not yet Steadywait a bit And suddenly between two great
clumsy idiotsGet out of the way there he signed with his
umbrellahe saw a hand raiseda white glove shaking a handkerchief
Another moment andthank God thank Godthere she was There was
Janey There was Mrs Hammond yes yes yesstanding by the rail and
smiling and nodding and waving her handkerchief

Well thats first classfirst class Well well well He positively
stamped Like lightning he drew out his cigarcase and offered it to
old Captain Johnson Have a cigar Captain Theyre pretty good Have
a couple Hereand he pressed all the cigars in the case on the
harbourmasterIve a couple of boxes up at the hotel

Thenks Mr Hammond wheezed old Captain Johnson

Hammond stuffed the cigarcase back His hands were shaking but hed
got hold of himself again He was able to face Janey There she was
leaning on the rail talking to some woman and at the same time watching
him ready for him It struck him as the gulf of water closed how
small she looked on that huge ship His heart was wrung with such a
spasm that he could have cried out How little she looked to have come
all that long way and back by herself Just like her though Just like
Janey She had the courage of aAnd now the crew had come forward and
parted the passengers they had lowered the rails for the gangways

The voices on shore and the voices on board flew to greet each other

All well

All well

Hows mother

Much better

Hullo Jean

Hillo Aun Emily

Had a good voyage

Splendid

Shant be long now

Not long now

The engines stopped Slowly she edged to the wharfside

Make way theremake waymake way And the wharf hands brought the
heavy gangways along at a sweeping run Hammond signed to Janey to stay
where she was The old harbourmaster stepped forward he followed As
to ladies first or any rot like that it never entered his head

After you Captain he cried genially And treading on the old mans
heels he strode up the gangway on to the deck in a beeline to Janey
and Janey was clasped in his arms

Well well well Yes yes Here we are at last he stammered It was
all he could say And Janey emerged and her cool little voicethe only
voice in the world for himsaid

Well darling Have you been waiting long

No not long Or at any rate it didnt matter It was over now But
the point was he had a cab waiting at the end of the wharf Was she
ready to go off Was her luggage ready In that case they could cut off
sharp with her cabin luggage and let the rest go hang until tomorrow
He bent over her and she looked up with her familiar halfsmile She
was just the same Not a day changed Just as hed always known her She
laid her small hand on his sleeve

How are the children John she asked

Hang the children Perfectly well Never better in their lives

Havent they sent me letters

Yes yesof course Ive left them at the hotel for you to digest
later on

We cant go quite so fast said she Ive got people to say goodbye
toand then theres the Captain As his face fell she gave his arm a
small understanding squeeze If the Captain comes off the bridge I
want you to thank him for having looked after your wife so beautifully
Well hed got her If she wanted another ten minutesAs he gave way
she was surrounded The whole firstclass seemed to want to say goodbye
to Janey

Goodbye dear Mrs Hammond And next time youre in Sydney Ill expect
you

Darling Mrs Hammond You wont forget to write to me will you

Well Mrs Hammond what this boat would have been without you

It was as plain as a pikestaff that she was by far the most popular
woman on board And she took it alljust as usual Absolutely composed
Just her little selfjust Janey all over standing there with her veil
thrown back Hammond never noticed what his wife had on It was all the
same to him whatever she wore But today he did notice that she wore a
black costumedidnt they call itwith white frills trimmings he
supposed they were at the neck and sleeves All this while Janey handed
him round

John dear And then I want to introduce you to

Finally they did escape and she led the way to her stateroom To
follow Janey down the passage that she knew so wellthat was so strange
to him to part the green curtains after her and to step into the cabin
that had been hers gave him exquisite happiness Butconfound itthe
stewardess was there on the floor strapping up the rugs

Thats the last Mrs Hammond said the stewardess rising and pulling
down her cuffs

He was introduced again and then Janey and the stewardess disappeared
into the passage He heard whisperings She was getting the tipping
business over he supposed He sat down on the striped sofa and took his
hat off There were the rugs she had taken with her they looked good as
new All her luggage looked fresh perfect The labels were written in
her beautiful little clear handMrs John Hammond

Mrs John Hammond He gave a long sigh of content and leaned back
crossing his arms The strain was over He felt he could have sat there
for ever sighing his reliefthe relief at being rid of that horrible
tug pull grip on his heart The danger was over That was the feeling
They were on dry land again

But at that moment Janeys head came round the corner

Darlingdo you mind I just want to go and say goodbye to the
doctor

Hammond started up Ill come with you

No no she said Dont bother Id rather not Ill not be a
minute

And before he could answer she was gone He had half a mind to run after
her but instead he sat down again

Would she really not be long What was the time now Out came the watch
he stared at nothing That was rather queer of Janey wasnt it Why
couldnt she have told the stewardess to say goodbye for her Why did
she have to go chasing after the ships doctor She could have sent
a note from the hotel even if the affair had been urgent Urgent Did
itcould it mean that she had been ill on the voyageshe was keeping
something from him That was it He seized his hat He was going off
to find that fellow and to wring the truth out of him at all costs He
thought hed noticed just something She was just a touch too calmtoo
steady From the very first moment

The curtains rang Janey was back He jumped to his feet

Janey have you been ill on this voyage You have

Ill Her airy little voice mocked him She stepped over the rugs and
came up close touched his breast and looked up at him

Darling she said dont frighten me Of course I havent Whatever
makes you think I have Do I look ill

But Hammond didnt see her He only felt that she was looking at him
and that there was no need to worry about anything She was here to look
after things It was all right Everything was

The gentle pressure of her hand was so calming that he put his over hers
to hold it there And she said

Stand still I want to look at you I havent seen you yet Youve
had your beard beautifully trimmed and you lookyounger I think and
decidedly thinner Bachelor life agrees with you

Agrees with me He groaned for love and caught her close again And
again as always he had the feeling that he was holding something that
never was quite hishis Something too delicate too precious that
would fly away once he let go

For Gods sake lets get off to the hotel so that we can be by
ourselves And he rang the bell hard for some one to look sharp with
the luggage



Walking down the wharf together she took his arm He had her on his arm
again And the difference it made to get into the cab after Janeyto
throw the redandyellow striped blanket round them bothto tell the
driver to hurry because neither of them had had any tea No more going
without his tea or pouring out his own She was back He turned to her
squeezed her hand and said gently teasingly in the special voice
he had for her Glad to be home again dearie She smiled she didnt
even bother to answer but gently she drew his hand away as they came to
the brighter streets

Weve got the best room in the hotel he said I wouldnt be put off
with another And I asked the chambermaid to put in a bit of a fire in
case you felt chilly Shes a nice attentive girl And I thought now
we were here we wouldnt bother to go home tomorrow but spend the day
looking round and leave the morning after Does that suit you Theres
no hurry is there The children will have you soon enough I thought a
days sightseeing might make a nice break in your journeyeh Janey

Have you taken the tickets for the day after she asked

I should think I have He unbuttoned his overcoat and took out his
bulging pocketbook Here we are I reserved a firstclass carriage to
Cooktown There it isMr and Mrs John Hammond I thought we might
as well do ourselves comfortably and we dont want other people butting
in do we But if youd like to stop here a bit longer

Oh no said Janey quickly Not for the world The day after
tomorrow then And the children

But they had reached the hotel The manager was standing in the broad
brilliantlylighted porch He came down to greet them A porter ran from
the hall for their boxes

Well Mr Arnold heres Mrs Hammond at last

The manager led them through the hall himself and pressed the
elevatorbell Hammond knew there were business pals of his sitting at
the little hall tables having a drink before dinner But he wasnt going
to risk interruption he looked neither to the right nor the left They
could think what they pleased If they didnt understand the more fools
theyand he stepped out of the lift unlocked the door of their room
and shepherded Janey in The door shut Now at last they were alone
together He turned up the light The curtains were drawn the fire
blazed He flung his hat on to the huge bed and went towards her

Butwould you believe itagain they were interrupted This time it
was the porter with the luggage He made two journeys of it leaving the
door open in between taking his time whistling through his teeth
in the corridor Hammond paced up and down the room tearing off his
gloves tearing off his scarf Finally he flung his overcoat on to the
bedside

At last the fool was gone The door clicked Now they were alone Said
Hammond I feel Ill never have you to myself again These cursed
people Janeyand he bent his flushed eager gaze upon herlets
have dinner up here If we go down to the restaurant well be
interrupted and then theres the confounded music the music hed
praised so highly applauded so loudly last night We shant be able
to hear each other speak Lets have something up here in front of the
fire Its too late for tea Ill order a little supper shall I How
does that idea strike you

Do darling said Janey And while youre awaythe childrens
letters

Oh later on will do said Hammond

But then wed get it over said Janey And Id first have time to

Oh I neednt go down explained Hammond Ill just ring and give the
order you dont want to send me away do you

Janey shook her head and smiled

But youre thinking of something else Youre worrying about
something said Hammond What is it Come and sit herecome and sit
on my knee before the fire

Ill just unpin my hat said Janey and she went over to the
dressingtable Aah She gave a little cry

What is it

Nothing darling Ive just found the childrens letters Thats all
right They will keep No hurry now She turned to him clasping them
She tucked them into her frilled blouse She cried quickly gaily Oh
how typical this dressingtable is of you

Why Whats the matter with it said Hammond

If it were floating in eternity I should say John laughed
Janey staring at the big bottle of hair tonic the wicker bottle of
eaudeCologne the two hairbrushes and a dozen new collars tied with
pink tape Is this all your luggage

Hang my luggage said Hammond but all the same he liked being laughed
at by Janey Lets talk Lets get down to things Tell meand as
Janey perched on his knees he leaned back and drew her into the deep
ugly chairtell me youre really glad to be back Janey

Yes darling I am glad she said

But just as when he embraced her he felt she would fly away so Hammond
never knewnever knew for dead certain that she was as glad as he
was How could he know Would he ever know Would he always have this
cravingthis pang like hunger somehow to make Janey so much part
of him that there wasnt any of her to escape He wanted to blot out
everybody everything He wished now hed turned off the light That
might have brought her nearer And now those letters from the children
rustled in her blouse He could have chucked them into the fire

Janey he whispered

Yes dear She lay on his breast but so lightly so remotely Their
breathing rose and fell together

Janey

What is it

Turn to me he whispered A slow deep flush flowed into his forehead
Kiss me Janey You kiss me

It seemed to him there was a tiny pausebut long enough for him to
suffer torturebefore her lips touched his firmly lightlykissing
them as she always kissed him as though the kisshow could he describe
itconfirmed what they were saying signed the contract But that
wasnt what he wanted that wasnt at all what he thirsted for He felt
suddenly horrible tired

If you knew he said opening his eyes what its been likewaiting
today I thought the boat never would come in There we were hanging
about What kept you so long

She made no answer She was looking away from him at the fire The
flames hurriedhurried over the coals flickered fell

Not asleep are you said Hammond and he jumped her up and down

No she said And then Dont do that dear No I was thinking As
a matter of fact she said one of the passengers died last nighta
man Thats what held us up We brought him inI mean he wasnt buried
at sea So of course the ships doctor and the shore doctor

What was it asked Hammond uneasily He hated to hear of death He
hated this to have happened It was in some queer way as though he and
Janey had met a funeral on their way to the hotel

Oh it wasnt anything in the least infectious said Janey She was
speaking scarcely above her breath It was heart A pause Poor
fellow she said Quite young And she watched the fire flicker and
fall He died in my arms said Janey

The blow was so sudden that Hammond thought he would faint He couldnt
move he couldnt breathe He felt all his strength flowingflowing
into the big dark chair and the big dark chair held him fast gripped
him forced him to bear it

What he said dully Whats that you say

The end was quite peaceful said the small voice He justand
Hammond saw her lift her gentle handbreathed his life away at the
end And her hand fell

Whoelse was there Hammond managed to ask

Nobody I was alone with him

Ah my God what was she saying What was she doing to him This would
kill him And all the while she spoke

I saw the change coming and I sent the steward for the doctor but the
doctor was too late He couldnt have done anything anyway

Butwhy you why you moaned Hammond

At that Janey turned quickly quickly searched his face

You dont mind John do you she asked You dontIts nothing to
do with you and me

Somehow or other he managed to shake some sort of smile at her Somehow
or other he stammered Nogoon go on I want you to tell me

But John darling

Tell me Janey

Theres nothing to tell she said wondering He was one of
the firstclass passengers I saw he was very ill when he came on
board But he seemed to be so much better until yesterday He had a
severe attack in the afternoonexcitementnervousness I think about
arriving And after that he never recovered

But why didnt the stewardess

Oh my dearthe stewardess said Janey What would he have felt And
besides he might have wanted to leave a message to

Didnt he muttered Hammond Didnt he say anything

No darling not a word She shook her head softly All the time I
was with him he was too weak he was too weak even to move a finger 

Janey was silent But her words so light so soft so chill seemed to
hover in the air to rain into his breast like snow

The fire had gone red Now it fell in with a sharp sound and the
room was colder Cold crept up his arms The room was huge immense
glittering It filled his whole world There was the great blind bed
with his coat flung across it like some headless man saying his prayers
There was the luggage ready to be carried away again anywhere tossed
into trains carted on to boats

 He was too weak He was too weak to move a finger And yet he died
in Janeys arms Shewhod nevernever once in all these yearsnever
on one single solitary occasion

No he mustnt think of it Madness lay in thinking of it No he
wouldnt face it He couldnt stand it It was too much to bear

And now Janey touched his tie with her fingers She pinched the edges of
the tie together

Youre notsorry I told you John darling It hasnt made you sad It
hasnt spoilt our eveningour being alone together

But at that he had to hide his face He put his face into her bosom and
his arms enfolded her

Spoilt their evening Spoilt their being alone together They would
never be alone together again




13 BANK HOLIDAY

A stout man with a pink face wears dingy white flannel trousers a blue
coat with a pink handkerchief showing and a straw hat much too small
for him perched at the back of his head He plays the guitar A little
chap in white canvas shoes his face hidden under a felt hat like
a broken wing breathes into a flute and a tall thin fellow with
bursting overripe button boots draws ribbonslong twisted streaming
ribbonsof tune out of a fiddle They stand unsmiling but not
serious in the broad sunlight opposite the fruitshop the pink
spider of a hand beats the guitar the little squat hand with a
brassandturquoise ring forces the reluctant flute and the fiddlers
arm tries to saw the fiddle in two

A crowd collects eating oranges and bananas tearing off the skins
dividing sharing One young girl has even a basket of strawberries
but she does not eat them Arent they dear She stares at the tiny
pointed fruits as if she were afraid of them The Australian soldier
laughs Here go on theres not more than a mouthful But he doesnt
want her to eat them either He likes to watch her little frightened
face and her puzzled eyes lifted to his Arent they a price He
pushes out his chest and grins Old fat women in velvet bodicesold
dusty pincushionslean old hags like worn umbrellas with a quivering
bonnet on top young women in muslins with hats that might have grown
on hedges and high pointed shoes men in khaki sailors shabby clerks
young Jews in fine cloth suits with padded shoulders and wide trousers
hospital boys in bluethe sun discovers themthe loud bold music
holds them together in one big knot for a moment The young ones are
larking pushing each other on and off the pavement dodging nudging
the old ones are talking So I said to im if you wants the doctor to
yourself fetch im says I

An by the time they was cooked there wasnt so much as you could put
in the palm of me and

The only ones who are quiet are the ragged children They stand as
close up to the musicians as they can get their hands behind their
backs their eyes big Occasionally a leg hops an arm wags A tiny
staggerer overcome turns round twice sits down solemn and then gets
up again

Aint it lovely whispers a small girl behind her hand

And the music breaks into bright pieces and joins together again and
again breaks and is dissolved and the crowd scatters moving slowly up
the hill

At the corner of the road the stalls begin

Ticklers Tuppence a tickler Ool ave a tickler Tickle em up
boys Little soft brooms on wire handles They are eagerly bought by
the soldiers

Buy a golliwog Tuppence a golliwog

Buy a jumping donkey All aliveoh

Superior chewing gum Buy something to do boys

Buy a rose Give er a rose boy Roses lady

Fevvers Fevvers They are hard to resist Lovely streaming feathers
emerald green scarlet bright blue canary yellow Even the babies wear
feathers threaded through their bonnets

And an old woman in a threecornered paper hat cries as if it were her
final parting advice the only way of saving yourself or of bringing him
to his senses Buy a threecornered at my dear an put it on

It is a flying day half sun half wind When the sun goes in a shadow
flies over when it comes out again it is fiery The men and women feel
it burning their backs their breasts and their arms they feel their
bodies expanding coming alive so that they make large embracing
gestures lift up their arms for nothing swoop down on a girl blurt
into laughter

Lemonade A whole tank of it stands on a table covered with a cloth
and lemons like blunted fishes blob in the yellow water It looks solid
like a jelly in the thick glasses Why cant they drink it without
spilling it Everybody spills it and before the glass is handed back
the last drops are thrown in a ring

Round the icecream cart with its striped awning and bright brass
cover the children cluster Little tongues lick lick round the cream
trumpets round the squares The cover is lifted the wooden spoon
plunges in one shuts ones eyes to feel it silently scrunching

Let these little birds tell you your future She stands beside the
cage a shrivelled ageless Italian clasping and unclasping her
dark claws Her face a treasure of delicate carving is tied in a
greenandgold scarf And inside their prison the lovebirds flutter
towards the papers in the seedtray

You have great strength of character You will marry a redhaired man
and have three children Beware of a blonde woman Look out Look
out A motorcar driven by a fat chauffeur comes rushing down the hill
Inside there a blonde woman pouting leaning forwardrushing through
your lifebeware beware

Ladies and gentlemen I am an auctioneer by profession and if what I
tell you is not the truth I am liable to have my licence taken away from
me and a heavy imprisonment He holds the licence across his chest the
sweat pours down his face into his paper collar his eyes look glazed
When he takes off his hat there is a deep pucker of angry flesh on his
forehead Nobody buys a watch

Look out again A huge barouche comes swinging down the hill with two
old old babies inside She holds up a lace parasol he sucks the knob
of his cane and the fat old bodies roll together as the cradle rocks
and the steaming horse leaves a trail of manure as it ambles down the
hill

Under a tree Professor Leonard in cap and gown stands beside his
banner He is here for one day from the London Paris and Brussels
Exhibition to tell your fortune from your face And he stands smiling
encouragement like a clumsy dentist When the big men romping and
swearing a moment before hand across their sixpence and stand before
him they are suddenly serious dumb timid almost blushing as the
Professors quick hand notches the printed card They are like little
children caught playing in a forbidden garden by the owner stepping
from behind a tree

The top of the hill is reached How hot it is How fine it is The
publichouse is open and the crowd presses in The mother sits on the
pavement edge with her baby and the father brings her out a glass of
dark brownish stuff and then savagely elbows his way in again A reek
of beer floats from the publichouse and a loud clatter and rattle of
voices

The wind has dropped and the sun burns more fiercely than ever Outside
the two swingdoors there is a thick mass of children like flies at the
mouth of a sweetjar

And up up the hill come the people with ticklers and golliwogs
and roses and feathers Up up they thrust into the light and heat
shouting laughing squealing as though they were being pushed by
something far below and by the sun far ahead of themdrawn up into
the full bright dazzling radiance to what




14 AN IDEAL FAMILY

That evening for the first time in his life as he pressed through the
swing door and descended the three broad steps to the pavement old
Mr Neave felt he was too old for the spring Springwarm eager
restlesswas there waiting for him in the golden light ready in front
of everybody to run up to blow in his white beard to drag sweetly on
his arm And he couldnt meet her no he couldnt square up once more
and stride off jaunty as a young man He was tired and although the
late sun was still shining curiously cold with a numbed feeling all
over Quite suddenly he hadnt the energy he hadnt the heart to stand
this gaiety and bright movement any longer it confused him He wanted
to stand still to wave it away with his stick to say Be off with
you Suddenly it was a terrible effort to greet as usualtipping his
wideawake with his stickall the people whom he knew the friends
acquaintances shopkeepers postmen drivers But the gay glance that
went with the gesture the kindly twinkle that seemed to say Im a
match and more for any of youthat old Mr Neave could not manage
at all He stumped along lifting his knees high as if he were walking
through air that had somehow grown heavy and solid like water And the
homewardlooking crowd hurried by the trams clanked the light carts
clattered the big swinging cabs bowled along with that reckless
defiant indifference that one knows only in dreams

It had been a day like other days at the office Nothing special had
happened Harold hadnt come back from lunch until close on four Where
had he been What had he been up to He wasnt going to let his father
know Old Mr Neave had happened to be in the vestibule saying goodbye
to a caller when Harold sauntered in perfectly turned out as usual
cool suave smiling that peculiar little halfsmile that women found so
fascinating

Ah Harold was too handsome too handsome by far that had been the
trouble all along No man had a right to such eyes such lashes and
such lips it was uncanny As for his mother his sisters and the
servants it was not too much to say they made a young god of him they
worshipped Harold they forgave him everything and he had needed some
forgiving ever since the time when he was thirteen and he had stolen
his mothers purse taken the money and hidden the purse in the cooks
bedroom Old Mr Neave struck sharply with his stick upon the pavement
edge But it wasnt only his family who spoiled Harold he reflected
it was everybody he had only to look and to smile and down they went
before him So perhaps it wasnt to be wondered at that he expected the
office to carry on the tradition Hm hm But it couldnt be done No
businessnot even a successful established big paying concerncould
be played with A man had either to put his whole heart and soul into
it or it went all to pieces before his eyes

And then Charlotte and the girls were always at him to make the whole
thing over to Harold to retire and to spend his time enjoying himself
Enjoying himself Old Mr Neave stopped dead under a group of ancient
cabbage palms outside the Government buildings Enjoying himself The
wind of evening shook the dark leaves to a thin airy cackle Sitting at
home twiddling his thumbs conscious all the while that his lifes
work was slipping away dissolving disappearing through Harolds fine
fingers while Harold smiled

Why will you be so unreasonable father Theres absolutely no need
for you to go to the office It only makes it very awkward for us when
people persist in saying how tired youre looking Heres this huge
house and garden Surely you could be happy ininappreciating it for
a change Or you could take up some hobby

And Lola the baby had chimed in loftily All men ought to have hobbies
It makes life impossible if they havent

Well well He couldnt help a grim smile as painfully he began to climb
the hill that led into Harcourt Avenue Where would Lola and her sisters
and Charlotte be if hed gone in for hobbies hed like to know Hobbies
couldnt pay for the town house and the seaside bungalow and their
horses and their golf and the sixtyguinea gramophone in the
musicroom for them to dance to Not that he grudged them these things
No they were smart goodlooking girls and Charlotte was a remarkable
woman it was natural for them to be in the swim As a matter of fact
no other house in the town was as popular as theirs no other family
entertained so much And how many times old Mr Neave pushing the cigar
box across the smokingroom table had listened to praises of his wife
his girls of himself even

Youre an ideal family sir an ideal family Its like something one
reads about or sees on the stage

Thats all right my boy old Mr Neave would reply Try one of
those I think youll like them And if you care to smoke in the garden
youll find the girls on the lawn I dare say

That was why the girls had never married so people said They could
have married anybody But they had too good a time at home They were
too happy together the girls and Charlotte Hm hm Well well
Perhaps so

By this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue
he had reached the corner house their house The carriage gates were
pushed back there were fresh marks of wheels on the drive And then he
faced the big whitepainted house with its wideopen windows its tulle
curtains floating outwards its blue jars of hyacinths on the broad
sills On either side of the carriage porch their hydrangeasfamous in
the townwere coming into flower the pinkish bluish masses of flower
lay like light among the spreading leaves And somehow it seemed to old
Mr Neave that the house and the flowers and even the fresh marks on
the drive were saying There is young life here There are girls

The hall as always was dusky with wraps parasols gloves piled on
the oak chests From the musicroom sounded the piano quick loud and
impatient Through the drawingroom door that was ajar voices floated

And were there ices came from Charlotte Then the creak creak of her
rocker

Ices cried Ethel My dear mother you never saw such ices Only two
kinds And one a common little strawberry shop ice in a sopping wet
frill

The food altogether was too appalling came from Marion

Still its rather early for ices said Charlotte easily

But why if one has them at all  began Ethel

Oh quite so darling crooned Charlotte

Suddenly the musicroom door opened and Lola dashed out She started
she nearly screamed at the sight of old Mr Neave

Gracious father What a fright you gave me Have you just come home
Why isnt Charles here to help you off with your coat

Her cheeks were crimson from playing her eyes glittered the hair
fell over her forehead And she breathed as though she had come running
through the dark and was frightened Old Mr Neave stared at his
youngest daughter he felt he had never seen her before So that was
Lola was it But she seemed to have forgotten her father it was not
for him that she was waiting there Now she put the tip of her crumpled
handkerchief between her teeth and tugged at it angrily The telephone
rang Aah Lola gave a cry like a sob and dashed past him The door of
the telephoneroom slammed and at the same moment Charlotte called Is
that you father

Youre tired again said Charlotte reproachfully and she stopped the
rocker and offered her warm plumlike cheek Brighthaired Ethel pecked
his beard Marions lips brushed his ear

Did you walk back father asked Charlotte

Yes I walked home said old Mr Neave and he sank into one of the
immense drawingroom chairs

But why didnt you take a cab said Ethel There are hundred of cabs
about at that time

My dear Ethel cried Marion if father prefers to tire himself out I
really dont see what business of ours it is to interfere

Children children coaxed Charlotte

But Marion wouldnt be stopped No mother you spoil father and its
not right You ought to be stricter with him Hes very naughty She
laughed her hard bright laugh and patted her hair in a mirror Strange
When she was a little girl she had such a soft hesitating voice she
had even stuttered and now whatever she saideven if it was only
Jam please fatherit rang out as though she were on the stage

Did Harold leave the office before you dear asked Charlotte
beginning to rock again

Im not sure said Old Mr Neave Im not sure I didnt see him
after four oclock

He said began Charlotte

But at that moment Ethel who was twitching over the leaves of some
paper or other ran to her mother and sank down beside her chair

There you see she cried Thats what I mean mummy Yellow with
touches of silver Dont you agree

Give it to me love said Charlotte She fumbled for her
tortoiseshell spectacles and put them on gave the page a little dab
with her plump small fingers and pursed up her lips Very sweet
she crooned vaguely she looked at Ethel over her spectacles But I
shouldnt have the train

Not the train wailed Ethel tragically But the trains the whole
point

Here mother let me decide Marion snatched the paper playfully from
Charlotte I agree with mother she cried triumphantly The train
overweights it

Old Mr Neave forgotten sank into the broad lap of his chair and
dozing heard them as though he dreamed There was no doubt about it he
was tired out he had lost his hold Even Charlotte and the girls were
too much for him tonight They were too too But all his drowsing
brain could think of wastoo rich for him And somewhere at the back
of everything he was watching a little withered ancient man climbing up
endless flights of stairs Who was he

I shant dress tonight he muttered

What do you say father

Eh what what Old Mr Neave woke with a start and stared across at
them I shant dress tonight he repeated

But father weve got Lucile coming and Henry Davenport and Mrs
Teddie Walker

It will look so very out of the picture

Dont you feel well dear

You neednt make any effort What is Charles for

But if youre really not up to it Charlotte wavered

Very well Very well Old Mr Neave got up and went to join that
little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressingroom

There young Charles was waiting for him Carefully as though everything
depended on it he was tucking a towel round the hotwater can Young
Charles had been a favourite of his ever since as a little redfaced
boy he had come into the house to look after the fires Old Mr Neave
lowered himself into the cane lounge by the window stretched out his
legs and made his little evening joke Dress him up Charles And
Charles breathing intensely and frowning bent forward to take the pin
out of his tie

Hm hm Well well It was pleasant by the open window very
pleasanta fine mild evening They were cutting the grass on the tennis
court below he heard the soft churr of the mower Soon the girls would
begin their tennis parties again And at the thought he seemed to
hear Marions voice ring out Good for you partner Oh played
partner Oh very nice indeed Then Charlotte calling from the
veranda Where is Harold And Ethel Hes certainly not here
mother And Charlottes vague He said

Old Mr Neave sighed got up and putting one hand under his beard he
took the comb from young Charles and carefully combed the white beard
over Charles gave him a folded handkerchief his watch and seals and
spectacle case

That will do my lad The door shut he sank back he was alone

And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights
that led to a glittering gay diningroom What legs he had They were
like a spidersthin withered

Youre an ideal family sir an ideal family

But if that were true why didnt Charlotte or the girls stop him Why
was he all alone climbing up and down Where was Harold Ah it was
no good expecting anything from Harold Down down went the little old
spider and then to his horror old Mr Neave saw him slip past the
diningroom and make for the porch the dark drive the carriage gates
the office Stop him stop him somebody

Old Mr Neave started up It was dark in his dressingroom the window
shone pale How long had he been asleep He listened and through
the big airy darkened house there floated faraway voices faraway
sounds Perhaps he thought vaguely he had been asleep for a long time
Hed been forgotten What had all this to do with himthis house and
Charlotte the girls and Haroldwhat did he know about them They were
strangers to him Life had passed him by Charlotte was not his wife
His wife

 A dark porch half hidden by a passionvine that drooped sorrowful
mournful as though it understood Small warm arms were round his neck
A face little and pale lifted to his and a voice breathed Goodbye
my treasure

My treasure Goodbye my treasure Which of them had spoken Why had
they said goodbye There had been some terrible mistake She was his
wife that little pale girl and all the rest of his life had been a
dream

Then the door opened and young Charles standing in the light put his
hands by his side and shouted like a young soldier Dinner is on the
table sir

Im coming Im coming said old Mr Neave




15 THE LADYS MAID

Eleven oclock A knock at the door I hope I havent disturbed you
madam You werent asleepwere you But Ive just given my lady her
tea and there was such a nice cup over I thought perhaps

 Not at all madam I always make a cup of tea last thing She drinks
it in bed after her prayers to warm her up I put the kettle on when she
kneels down and I say to it Now you neednt be in too much of a hurry
to say your prayers But its always boiling before my lady is half
through You see madam we know such a lot of people and theyve all
got to be prayed forevery one My lady keeps a list of the names in a
little red book Oh dear whenever some one new has been to see us and
my lady says afterwards Ellen give me my little red book I feel
quite wild I do Theres another I think keeping her out of her
bed in all weathers And she wont have a cushion you know madam she
kneels on the hard carpet It fidgets me something dreadful to see
her knowing her as I do Ive tried to cheat her Ive spread out
the eiderdown But the first time I did itoh she gave me such a
lookholy it was madam Did our Lord have an eiderdown Ellen she
said ButI was younger at the timeI felt inclined to say No but
our Lord wasnt your age and he didnt know what it was to have your
lumbago Wickedwasnt it But shes too good you know madam When
I tucked her up just now and seensaw her lying back her hands outside
and her head on the pillowso prettyI couldnt help thinking Now
you look just like your dear mother when I laid her out

 Yes madam it was all left to me Oh she did look sweet I did her
hair softlike round her forehead all in dainty curls and just to
one side of her neck I put a bunch of most beautiful purple pansies
Those pansies made a picture of her madam I shall never forget them
I thought tonight when I looked at my lady Now if only the pansies
was there no one could tell the difference

 Only the last year madam Only after shed got a
littlewellfeeble as you might say Of course she was never
dangerous she was the sweetest old lady But how it took her wasshe
thought shed lost something She couldnt keep still she couldnt
settle All day long shed be up and down up and down youd meet her
everywhereon the stairs in the porch making for the kitchen And
shed look up at you and shed sayjust like a child Ive lost it
Ive lost it Come along Id say come along and Ill lay out your
patience for you But shed catch me by the handI was a favourite of
hersand whisper Find it for me Ellen Find it for me Sad wasnt
it

 No she never recovered madam She had a stroke at the end Last
words she ever said wasvery slow Look intheLookin And then
she was gone

 No madam I cant say I noticed it Perhaps some girls But you
see its like this Ive got nobody but my lady My mother died of
consumption when I was four and I lived with my grandfather who kept
a hairdressers shop I used to spend all my time in the shop under a
table dressing my dolls haircopying the assistants I suppose They
were ever so kind to me Used to make me little wigs all colours the
latest fashions and all And there Id sit all day quiet as quietthe
customers never knew Only now and again Id take my peep from under the
tablecloth

 But one day I managed to get a pair of scissors andwould you
believe it madam I cut off all my hair snipped it off all in bits
like the little monkey I was Grandfather was furious He caught hold of
the tongsI shall never forget itgrabbed me by the hand and shut my
fingers in them Thatll teach you he said It was a fearful burn
Ive got the mark of it today

 Well you see madam hed taken such pride in my hair He used to
sit me up on the counter before the customers came and do it something
beautifulbig soft curls and waved over the top I remember the
assistants standing round and me ever so solemn with the penny
grandfather gave me to hold while it was being done But he always took
the penny back afterwards Poor grandfather Wild he was at the fright
Id made of myself But he frightened me that time Do you know what
I did madam I ran away Yes I did round the corners in and out I
dont know how far I didnt run Oh dear I must have looked a sight
with my hand rolled up in my pinny and my hair sticking out People must
have laughed when they saw me

 No madam grandfather never got over it He couldnt bear the sight
of me after Couldnt eat his dinner even if I was there So my aunt
took me She was a cripple an upholstress Tiny She had to stand on
the sofas when she wanted to cut out the backs And it was helping her I
met my lady

 Not so very madam I was thirteen turned And I dont remember ever
feelingwella child as you might say You see there was my uniform
and one thing and another My lady put me into collars and cuffs from
the first Oh yesonce I did That wasfunny It was like this My
lady had her two little nieces staying with herwe were at Sheldon at
the timeand there was a fair on the common

Now Ellen she said I want you to take the two young ladies for a
ride on the donkeys Off we went solemn little loves they were each
had a hand But when we came to the donkeys they were too shy to go on
So we stood and watched instead Beautiful those donkeys were They were
the first Id seen out of a cartfor pleasure as you might say They
were a lovely silvergrey with little red saddles and blue bridles and
bells jingajingling on their ears And quite big girlsolder than me
evenwere riding them ever so gay Not at all common I dont mean
madam just enjoying themselves And I dont know what it was but
the way the little feet went and the eyesso gentleand the soft
earsmade me want to go on a donkey more than anything in the world

 Of course I couldnt I had my young ladies And what would I have
looked like perched up there in my uniform But all the rest of the day
it was donkeysdonkeys on the brain with me I felt I should have burst
if I didnt tell some one and who was there to tell But when I went to
bedI was sleeping in Mrs Jamess bedroom our cook that was at
the timeas soon as the lights was out there they were my donkeys
jingling along with their neat little feet and sad eyes Well madam
would you believe it I waited for a long time and pretended to be
asleep and then suddenly I sat up and called out as loud as I could I
do want to go on a donkey I do want a donkeyride You see I had to
say it and I thought they wouldnt laugh at me if they knew I was only
dreaming Artfulwasnt it Just what a silly child would think

 No madam never now Of course I did think of it at one time But
it wasnt to be He had a little flowershop just down the road and
across from where we was living Funnywasnt it And me such a one for
flowers We were having a lot of company at the time and I was in and
out of the shop more often than not as the saying is And Harry and
I his name was Harry got to quarrelling about how things ought to be
arrangedand that began it Flowers you wouldnt believe it
madam the flowers he used to bring me Hed stop at nothing It was
liliesofthevalley more than once and Im not exaggerating Well of
course we were going to be married and live over the shop and it was
all going to be just so and I was to have the window to arrange Oh
how Ive done that window of a Saturday Not really of course madam
just dreaming as you might say Ive done it for Christmasmotto in
holly and alland Ive had my Easter lilies with a gorgeous star all
daffodils in the middle Ive hungwell thats enough of that The day
came he was to call for me to choose the furniture Shall I ever forget
it It was a Tuesday My lady wasnt quite herself that afternoon Not
that shed said anything of course she never does or will But I knew
by the way that she kept wrapping herself up and asking me if it was
coldand her little nose looked pinched I didnt like leaving her I
knew Id be worrying all the time At last I asked her if shed rather
I put it off Oh no Ellen she said you mustnt mind about me You
mustnt disappoint your young man And so cheerful you know madam
never thinking about herself It made me feel worse than ever I began
to wonder then she dropped her handkerchief and began to stoop down to
pick it up herselfa thing she never did Whatever are you doing I
cried running to stop her Well she said smiling you know madam
I shall have to begin to practise Oh it was all I could do not to
burst out crying I went over to the dressingtable and made believe
to rub up the silver and I couldnt keep myself in and I asked her if
shed rather I didnt get married No Ellen she saidthat was her
voice madam like Im giving youNo Ellen not for the wide world
But while she said it madamI was looking in her glass of course she
didnt know I could see hershe put her little hand on her heart just
like her dear mother used to and lifted her eyes Oh madam

When Harry came I had his letters all ready and the ring and a ducky
little brooch hed given mea silver bird it was with a chain in
its beak and on the end of the chain a heart with a dagger Quite
the thing I opened the door to him I never gave him time for a word
There you are I said Take them all back I said its all over
Im not going to marry you I said I cant leave my lady White he
turned as white as a woman I had to slam the door and there I
stood all of a tremble till I knew he had gone When I opened the
doorbelieve me or not madamthat man was gone I ran out into the
road just as I was in my apron and my houseshoes and there I stayed
in the middle of the road staring People must have laughed if they
saw me

 Goodness graciousWhats that Its the clock striking And here
Ive been keeping you awake Oh madam you ought to have stopped
me Can I tuck in your feet I always tuck in my ladys feet every
night just the same And she says Good night Ellen Sleep sound and
wake early I dont know what I should do if she didnt say that now

 Oh dear I sometimes think whatever should I do if anything were
to But there thinkings no good to any oneis it madam Thinking
wont help Not that I do it often And if ever I do I pull myself up
sharp Now then Ellen At it againyou silly girl If you cant find
anything better to do than to start thinking
