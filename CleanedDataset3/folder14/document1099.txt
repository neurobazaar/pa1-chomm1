THE RIVERMAN

by Stewart Edward White




I


The time was the year 1872 and the place a bend in the river above a
long pond terminating in a dam Beyond this dam and on a flat
lower than it stood a twostory mill structure Save for a small
stumpdotted clearing and the road that led from it all else was
forest Here in the bottomlands following the course of the stream
the hardwoods grew dense their uppermost branches just beginning to
spray out in the first green of spring Farther back where the higher
lands arose from the swamp could be discerned the graceful frond of
white pines and hemlock and the sturdy tops of Norways and spruce

A strong wind blew up the length of the pond It ruffled the surface of
the water swooping down in fanshaped scurrying catspaws turning
the darkblue surface as one turns the nap of velvet At the upper end
of the pond it even succeeded in raising quite respectable wavelets
which LAP LAP LAPPED eagerly against a barrier of floating logs that
filled completely the mouth of the inlet river And behind this barrier
were other logs and yet others as far as the eye could see so that
the entire surface of the stream was carpeted by the brown timbers A
man could have walked down the middle of that river as down a highway

On the bank and in a small woodsopening burned two fires their smoke
ducking and twisting under the buffeting of the wind The first of
these fires occupied a shallow trench dug for its accommodation and was
overarched by a rustic framework from which hung several pails kettles
and pots An injuredlooking chubby man in a battered brown derby hat
moved here and there He divided his time between the utensils and an
indifferent youthhis cookee The other and larger fire centred a
rectangle composed of tall racks built of saplings and intended for the
drying of clothes Two large tents gleamed white among the trees

About the dryingfire were gathered thirtyodd men Some were
halfreclining before the blaze others sat in rows on logs drawn close
for the purpose still others squatted like Indians on their heels
their hands thrown forward to keep the balance Nearly all were smoking
pipes

Every age was represented in this group but young men predominated All
wore woollen trousers stuffed into leather boots reaching just to the
knee These boots were armed on the soles with rows of formidable sharp
spikes or caulks a half and sometimes even three quarters of an inch in
length The tight drivers shoe and stagged trousers had not then come
into use From the waist down these men wore all alike as though in a
uniform the outward symbol of their calling From the waist up was more
latitude of personal taste One young fellow sported a brightcoloured
Mackinaw blanket jacket another wore a red knit sash with tasselled
ends a thirds fancy ran to a bright bandana about his neck Headgear
too covered wide variations of broader or narrower brim of higher or
lower crown and the faces beneath those hats differed as everywhere
the human countenance differs Only when the inspection passing the
gradations of broad or narrow thick or thin bony or rounded rested
finally on the eyes would the observer have caught again the castemark
which stamped these men as belonging to a distinct order and separated
them essentially from other men in other occupations Blue and brown
and black and gray these eyes were but all steady and clear with the
steadiness and clarity that comes to those whose daily work compels
them under penalty to pay close and undeviating attention to their
surroundings This is true of sailors hunters plainsmen cowboys
and tugboat captains It was especially true of the oldfashioned
riverdriver for a misstep a miscalculation a moments forgetfulness
of the sullen forces shifting and changing about him could mean for
him maiming or destruction So finally to one of an imaginative bent
these eyes like the cork boots grew to seem part of the uniform one
of the marks of their caste the outward symbol of their calling

Blow you son of a gun cried disgustedly one young fellow with a red
bandana apostrophising the wind I wonder if theres ANY side of this
fire that aint smoky

Keep your hair on bub advised a calm and grizzled oldtimer
Theres never no smoke on the OTHER side of the firewhichever
that happens to be And as for windshe just makes holiday for the
riverhogs

Holiday hell snorted the younger man We ought to be down to Bulls
Dam before now

And Bulls Dam is halfway to Redding mocked a reptilian and
redheaded giant on the log and Redding is the happy childhood home
of

The young man leaped to his feet and seized from a pile of tools a
peavya dangerous weapon like a heavy canthook but armed at the end
with a sharp steel shoe

Thats about enough he warned raising his weapon his face suffused
and angry The redheaded man quite unafraid rose slowly from the log
and advanced barehanded his small eyes narrowed and watchful

But immediately a dozen men interfered

Dry up advised the grizzled oldtimerTom North by name You
Purdy set down and you young squirt subside If youre going to have
ructions why have em but not on drive If you dont look out Ill
set you both to rustling wood for the doctor

At this threat the belligerents dropped muttering to their places The
wind continued to blow the fire continued to flare up and down the men
continued to smoke exchanging from time to time desultory and
aimless remarks Only Tom North carried on a consecutive lowvoiced
conversation with another of about his own age

Just the same Jim he was saying it is a little tough on the
boysthis new sluicegate business Theyve been sort of expectin a
chance for a day or two at Redding and now if this son of a gun of a
wind hangs out I dont know when well make her The shallows at Bulls
was always bad enough but this is worse

Yes I expected to pick you up way below admitted Jim whose
turkey or clothesbag at his side proclaimed him a newcomer Had
quite a tramp to find you

This stretch of slack water was always a terror went on North and
we had fairly to pikepole every stick through when the wind blew but
now that dams backed the water up until there reely aint no current at
all And this breeze has just stopped the drive dead as a smelt

Dont opening the sluicegates give her a draw inquired the newcomer

Not against this windand not much of a draw anyway I should guess

How long you been hung

Just today I expect Jack will be down from the rear shortly Ought
to see somethings wrong when he runs against the tail of this jam of
ours

At this moment the lugubrious roundfaced man in the derby hat stepped
aside from the row of steaming utensils he had been arranging

Grub pile he remarked in a conversational tone of voice

The group arose as one man and moved upon the heap of cutlery and of tin
plates and cups From the open fiftypound lard pails and kettles they
helped themselves liberally then retired to squat in little groups here
and there near the sources of supply Mere conversation yielded to an
industrious silence Sadly the cook surveyed the scene his arms folded
across the dirty white apron an immense mental reservation accenting
the melancholy of his countenance After some moments of contemplation
he mixed a fizzling concoction of vinegar and soda which he drank His
rotundity to the contrary notwithstanding he was ravaged by a
gnawing dyspepsia and the sight of six eggs eaten as a side dish to
substantials carried consternation to his interior

So busily engaged was each after his own fashion that nobody observed
the approach of a solitary figure down the highway of the river The
man appeared tiny around the upper bend momently growing larger as he
approached His progress was jerky and on an uneven zigzag according
as the logs lay by leaps short runs brief pauses as a riverman
goes Finally he stepped ashore just below the camp stamped his
feet vigorously free of water and approached the group around the
cookingfire

No one saw him save the cook who vouchsafed him a stately and
lugubrious inclination of the head

The newcomer was a man somewhere about thirty years of age squarely
built big of bone compact in bulk His face was burly jolly and
reddened rather than tanned by long exposure A pair of twinkling
blue eyes and a humorously quirked mouth redeemed his countenance from
commonplaceness

He spread his feet apart and surveyed the scene

Well boys he remarked at last in a rollicking big voice Im glad
to see the situation hasnt spoiled your appetites

At this they looked up with a spontaneous answering grin Tom North laid
aside his plate and started to arise

Sit still Tom interposed the newcomer Eat hearty Im going to
feed yet myself Then well see whats to be done I think first thing
youd better see to having this wind turned off

After the meal was finished North and his principal sauntered to the
waters edge where they stood for a minute looking at the logs and the
ruffled expanse of water below

Might as well have sails on them and be done with it remarked Jack
Orde reflectively Couldnt hold em any tighter Its a pity that old
mossback had to put in a mill The water was slack enough before but
now there seems to be no current at all

Case of wait for the wind agreed Tom North Old Daly will be
redheaded He must be about out of logs at the mill The floodwaters
going down every minute and itll make the riffles above Redding a holy
fright And I expect Johnsons drive will be down on our rear most any
time

Its there already Lets go take a look suggested Orde

They picked their way around the edge of the pond to the site of the new
mill

Sluice open all right commented Orde Thought she might be closed

I saw to that rejoined North in an injured tone

Course agreed Orde but he might have dropped her shut on you
between times when you werent looking

He walked out on the structure and looked down on the smooth water
rushing through

Ought to make a draw he reflected Then he laughed Tom look here
he called Climb down and take a squint at this

North clambered to a position below

The son of a gun he exclaimed

The sluice instead of bedding at the natural channel of the river
had been built a good six feet above that level so that even with the
gates wide open a head of six feet was retained in the slack water of
the pond

No wonder we couldnt get a draw said Orde Lets hunt up old
Whatshisname and have a powwow

His name is plain Reed explained North There he comes now

Sainted cats cried Orde with one of his big rollicking chuckles
Where did you catch it

The owner of the dam flapped into view as a lank and lengthy individual
dressed in loose long clothes and wearing atop a battered old plug
hat the nap of which seemed all to have been rubbed off the wrong way

As he bore down on the intruders with tremendous nervous strides
they perceived him to be an old man white of hair cadaverous of
countenance with thin straight lips and burning fanatic eyes beneath
stiff and bushy brows

Goodmorning Mr Reed shouted Orde above the noise of the water

Goodmorning gentlemen replied the apparition

Nice dam you got here went on Orde

Reed nodded his fiery eyes fixed unblinking on the riverman

But you havent been quite square to us said Orde You arent giving
us much show to get our logs out

How so snapped the owner his thin lips tightening

Oh I guess you know all right laughed Orde clambering leisurely
back to the top of the dam That sluice is a good six foot too high

Is that so cried the old man plunging suddenly into a craze of
excitement Well let me tell you this Mr Man Im giving you all the
law gives you and thats the natural flow of the river and not a thing
more will you get You that comes to waste and destroy to arrogate unto
yourselves the kingdoms of the yearth and all the fruits thereof let me
tell you you cant override Simeon Reed Im engaged here in a peaceful
and fittin operation which is to feed the hungry by means of this
gristmill not to rampage and bring destruction to the noble forests
God has planted Ive give you what the law gives you and nothin
more

Somewhat astonished at this outbreak the two rivermen stood for a
moment staring at the old man Then a steely glint crept into Ordes
frank blue eye and the corners of his mouth tightened

We want no trouble with you Mr Reed said he and Im no lawyer to
know what the law requires you to do and what it requires you not to do
But I do know that this is the only dam on the river with sluices built
up that way and I do know that well never get those logs out if we
dont get more draw on the water Goodday

Followed by the reluctant North he walked away leaving the gaunt figure
of the dam owner gazing after them his black garments flapping about
him his hands clasped behind his back his ruffled plug hat thrust from
his forehead

Well burst out North when they were out of hearing

Well mimicked Orde with a laugh

Are you going to let that old highbanker walk all over you

What are you going to do about it Tom Its his dam

I dont know But you aint going to let him bang us up here all
summer

Sure not But the winds shifting Lets see what the weathers like
tomorrow Todays pretty late




II


The next morning dawned clear and breathless Before daylight the
pessimistic cook was out his fire winking bravely against the darkness
His only satisfaction of the long day came when he aroused the men from
the heavy sleep into which daily toil plunged them With the first light
the entire crew were at the banks of the river

As soon as the wind died the logs had begun to drift slowly out into
the open water The surface of the pond was covered with the scattered
timbers floating idly After a few moments the clank of the bars and
ratchet was heard as two of the men raised the heavy sluicegate on the
dam A roar of water momently increasing marked the slow rise of the
barrier A very imaginative man might then have made out a tendency
forward on the part of those timbers floating nearest the centre of the
pond It was a very sluggish tendency however and the men watching
critically shook their heads

Four more had by this time joined the two men who had raised the
gate and all together armed with long pike poles walked out on the
funnelshaped booms that should concentrate the logs into the chute
Here they prodded forward the few timbers within reach and waited for
more

These were a long time coming Members of the driving crew leaped
shouting from one log to another Sometimes when the space across
was too wide to jump they propelled a log over either by rolling it
paddling it or projecting it by the shock of a leap on one end In
accomplishing these feats of tightrope balance they stood upright and
graceful quite unconscious of themselves their bodies accustomed
by long habit to nice and instant obedience to the almost unconscious
impulses of the brain Only their eyes intent preoccupied blazed out
by sheer willpower the unstable path their owners should follow Once
at the forefront of the drive the men began vigorously to urge the logs
forward This they accomplished almost entirely by main strength for
the sluggish current gave them little aid Under the pressure of their
feet as they pushed against their implements the logs dipped rolled
and plunged Nevertheless they worked as surely from the decks of these
unstable craft as from the solid earth itself

In this manner the logs in the centre of the pond were urged forward
until above the chute they caught the slightly accelerated current
which should bring them down to the pikepole men at the dam
Immediately when this stronger influence was felt the drivers
zigzagged back up stream to start a fresh batch In the meantime a great
many logs drifted away to right and left into stagnant water where
they lay absolutely motionless The moving of them was deferred for the
sacking crew which would bring up the rear

Jack Orde wandered back and forth over the work his hands clasped
behind his back a short pipe clenched between his teeth To the edge of
the drive he rode the logs then took to the bank and strolled down
to the dam There he stood for a moment gazing aimlessly at the water
making over the apron after which he returned to the work No cloud
obscured the serene goodnature of his face Meeting Tom Norths
troubled glance he grinned broadly

Told you wed have Johnson on our necks he remarked jerking his
thumb up river toward a rapidly approaching figure

This soon defined itself as a tall sunreddened very blond individual
with a choleric blue eye

What in hells the matter here he yelled as soon as he came within
hearing distance

Orde made no reply but stood contemplating the newcomer with a flicker
of amusement

What in hells the matter repeated the latter violently

Better go there and inquire rejoined Orde drolly What ails you
Johnson

Were right at your rear cried the other and you aint even made a
start gettin through this dam Well lose the water next Why in hell
aint you through and gone

Keep your shirt on advised Orde Were getting through as fast as
we can If you want these logs pushed any faster come down and do it
yourself

Johnson vouchsafed no reply but splashed away over the logs examining
in detail the progress of the work After a little he returned within
hailing distance

If you cant get out logs why do you take the job he roared with
a string of oaths If you hang my drive damn you youll catch it
for damages Its gettin to a purty pass when any old highbanker from
anywheres can get out and play jackstraws holdin up every drive in the
river I tell you our mills need logs and whats more theyre agoin to
GIT them

He departed in a rumble of vituperation

Orde laughed humorously at his foreman

Johnson gets so mad sometimes his skin cracks he remarked
However he went on more seriously theres a heap in what he means
if there aint so much in what he says Ill go labour with our old
friend below

He regained the bank stopped to light his pipe and sauntered with
every appearance of leisure down the bank past the dam to the mill
structure below

Here he found the owner occupying a chair tilted back against the wall
of the building His ruffled plug hat was thrust as usual well away
from his high and narrow forehead the long broadcloth coat fell back to
reveal an unbuttoned waistcoat the flapping black trousers were hitched
up far enough to display woollen socks wrinkled about bony shanks He
was whittling a pine stick which he held pointing down between his
spread knees and conversing animatedly with a young fellow occupying
another chair at his side

And there comes one of em now declaimed the old man dramatically

Orde nodded briefly to the stranger and came at once to business

I want to talk this matter over with you he began We arent making
much progress We cant afford to hang up the drive and the water is
going down every day Weve got to have more water Ill tell you what
well do If youll let us cut down the new sill well replace it in
good shape when we get all our logs through

No sir promptly vetoed the old man

Well well give you something for the privilege What do you think is
fair

I tell ye Ill give you your legal rights and not a cent more
replied the old man still quietly but with quivering nostrils

What is your name asked Orde

My name is Reed sir

Well Mr Reed stop and think what this means Its a more serious
matter than you think In a little while the water will be so low in the
river that it will be impossible to take out the logs this year That
means a large loss of course as you know

I dont know nothin about the pesky business and I dont wan to
snorted Reed

Well theres borers for one thing to spoil a good many of the logs
And think what it will mean to the mills No logs means no lumber That
is bankruptcy for a good many who have contracts to fulfil And no logs
means the mills must close Thousands of men will be thrown out of their
jobs and a good many of them will go hungry And with the stream full
of the old cutting that means less to do next winter in the woodsmore
men thrown out Getting out a seasons cut with the floodwater is
a pretty serious matter to a great many people and if you insist on
holding us up here in this slack water the situation will soon become
alarming

Ye finished demanded Reed grimly

Yes replied Orde

The old man cast from him his halfwhittled piece of pine He closed his
jackknife with a snap and thrust it in his pocket He brought to earth
the front legs of his chair with a thump and jammed his ruffled plug
hat to its proper place

And if the whole kit and kaboodle of ye starved outright said he
it would but be the fulfillin of the word of the prophet who says
So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts and they shall bereave
thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and I will bring
the sword upon thee I the Lord have spoken it

Thats your last word inquired Orde

Thats my last word and my first Ye that make of Gods smilin land
waste places and a wilderness by your own folly shall ye perish

Goodday said Orde whirling on his heel without further argument

The young man who had during this colloquy sat an interested and silent
spectator arose and joined him Orde looked at his new companion
a little curiously He was a very slender young man tautmuscled
tautnerved but impassive in demeanour He possessed a shrewd thin
face steelgray inscrutable eyes behind glasses His costume was quite
simply an old gray suit of business clothes and a gray felt hat At the
moment he held in his mouth an unlighted and badly chewed cigar

Nice amiable old party volunteered Orde with a chuckle

Seems to be agreed the young man drily

Well I reckon well just have to worry along without him remarked
Orde striking his steel caulks into the first log and preparing to
cross out into the river where the work was going on

Wait a minute said the young fellow Have you any objections to my
hanging around a little to watch the work My name is NewmarkJoseph
Newmark Im out in this country a good deal for my health This thing
interests me

Sure replied Orde puzzled Look all you want to The scenerys
free

Yes But can you put me up Can I get a chance to stay with you a
little while

Oh as far as Im concerned agreed Orde heartily But he
supplemented with one of his contagious chuckles Im only riverboss
Youll have to fix it up with the doctorthe cook I mean he
explained as Newmark look puzzled Youll find him at camp up behind
that brush Hes a slim handsome fellow with a jolly expression of
countenance

He leaped lightly out over the bobbing timbers leaving Newmark to find
his way

In the centre of the stream the work had been gradually slowing down to
a standstill with the subsidence of the first rush of water after the
sluicegate was opened Tom North leaning gracefully against the shaft
of a peavy looked up eagerly as his principal approached

Well Jack he inquired is it to be peace or war

War replied Orde briefly




III


At this moment the cook stepped into view and making a trumpet of his
two hands sent across the water a long weird and not unmusical cry
The men at once began slowly to drift in the direction of the camp
There when the tin plates had all been filled and each had found a
place to his liking Orde addressed them His manner was casual and
conversational

Boys said he the old mossback who owns that dam has come up here
loaded to scatter Hes built up the sill of that gate until we cant
get a draw on the water and he refuses to give lend or sell us the
right to cut her out Ive made him every reasonable proposition but
all I get back is quotations from the prophets Now weve got to get
those logs outthats what were here for A fine bunch of whitewater
birlers wed look if we got hung up by an old mossback in a plug hat
Johnny Sims whats the answer

Cut her out grinned Johnny Sims briefly

Correct replied Orde with a chuckle Cut her out But my son its
against the law to interfere with another mans property

This was so obviously humourous in intent that its only reception
consisted of more grins from everybody

But went on Orde more seriously its quite a job We cant work
more than six or eight men at it at a time We got to work as fast as we
can before the old man can interfere

The nearest sheriffs at Spruce Rapids commented some one
philosophically

We have sixty men all told said Orde We ought to be able to carry
it through

He filled his plate and walked across to a vacant place Here he found
himself next to Newmark

Hello he greeted that young man fixed it with the doctor all
right

Yes replied Newmark in his brief dry manner thanks I think I
ought to tell you that the sheriff is not at Spruce Rapids but at the
villageexpecting trouble

Orde whistled then broke into a roar of delight

Boys he called old Plug Hats got the sheriff right handy I guess
he sort of expected wed be thinking of cutting through that dam Howd
you like to go to jail

Id like to see any sheriff take us to jail unless he had an army with
him growled one of the riverjacks

Has he a posse inquired Orde of Newmark

I didnt see any but I understood in the village that the governor had
been advised to hold State troops in readiness for trouble

Orde fell into a brown study eating mechanically The men began an
eager and somewhat truculent discussion full of lawless and bloodthirsty
suggestion Some suggested the kidnapping and sequestration of Reed
until the affair should be finished

Howd he get hold of his old sheriff then they inquired with some
pertinence

Orde however paid no attention to all this talk but continued to
frown into space At last his face cleared and he slapped down his tin
plate so violently that the knife and fork jumped off into the dirt

I have it he cried aloud

But he would not tell what he had After the noon hour he instructed
a halfdozen men to provide themselves with saws axes picks and
shovels and all marched in the direction of the mill

When within a hundred yards or so of that structure the advancing
riverman saw the lank black figure of the mill owner flap into sight
astride a bony old horse and clatter away coattails flying up the
road and into the waiting forest

Now boys cried Orde crisply Hell be back in an hour with the
sheriff Lively He rapidly designated ten men of his crew You boys
get to work and make things hum Get as much done as you can before the
sheriff comes

Hell have to bring all of Spruce County to get me commented one of
those chosen spitting on his hands

Me too said others

Now listen said Orde holding them with an impressive gesture When
that sheriff comes with or without a posse I want you to go peaceably
Understand

Cave in Not much cried Purdy

See here and Orde drew them aside to an earnest lowvoiced
conversation that lasted several minutes When he had finished he
clapped each of them on the back and all moved off laughing to the
dam

Now boys he commanded the others no row without orders
Understand If theres going to be a fight Ill give you the word
when

The chopping crew descended to the bottom of the sluice the gate of
which had been shut and began immediately to chop away at the apron
As the water in the pond above had been drawn low by the mornings work
none overflowed the gate so the men were enabled to work dry Below the
apron of course had been filled in with earth and stones As soon
as the axemen had effected an entry to this deposit other men with
shovels and picks began to remove the filling

The work had continued nearly an hour when Orde commanded the fifty or
more idlers back to camp

Get out boys he ordered The sheriff will be here pretty quick now
and I dont want any row Get out of sight

And leave them to fight her out alone Guess not grumbled a tall
burly individual with a red face

Orde immediately walked directly to this man

Am I bossing this drive or am I not he demanded

The riverman growled something

SMACK SMACK sounded Ordes fists The man taken by surprise went
down in a heap but immediately rebounded to his feet as though made
of rubber But Orde had seized a peavy and stood over against his
antagonist the murderous weapon upraised

Lie down you hound or Ill brain you he roared at the top strength
of his great voice Want fight do you Well you wont have to wait
till the sheriff gets here You make a move

For a full half minute the man crouched breathless and Orde his ruddy
face congested held his threatening attitude Then he dropped his peavy
and stepped aside

March he commanded Get your turkey and hit the hay trail Youll
get your time at Redding

The man sullenly arose and slouched away grumbling under his breath
Orde watched him from sight then turned to the silent group a new
crispness in his manner

Well he demanded

Hesitating they turned to the river trail leaving the ten still
working at the sluice When well within the fringe of the brush Orde
called a halt His customary goodhumour seemed quite restored

Now boys he commanded squat down and lay low You give me an ache
Dont you suppose I got this thing all figured out If fight would do
any good you know mighty well Id fight And the boys wont be in jail
any longer than it takes to get a wire to Daly to bail them out Smoke
up and dont bother

They filled their pipes and settled down to an enjoyment of the
situation Ordinarily from very early in the morning until very late at
night the riverman is busy every instant at his dangerous and absorbing
work Those affairs which do not immediately concern his taskas the
swiftness of rapids the state of flood the curves of streams the
height of water the obstructions of channels the quantities of
logspass by the outer fringe of his consciousness if indeed they
reach him at all Thus often he works all day up to his waist in a
current bearing the rotten ice of the first breakup or endures the
drenching of an early spring rain or battles the rigours of a
belated snow with apparent indifference You or I would be exceedingly
uncomfortable would require an effort of fortitude to make the plunge
Yet these men absorbed in the mighty problems of their task have
little attention to spare to such things The cold the wet the
discomfort the hunger the weariness all pass as shadows on the
background In like manner the softer moods of the spring rarely
penetrate through the concentration of faculties on the work The warm
sun shines the birds by thousands flutter and twitter and sing their
way north the delicate green of spring showered from the hand of the
passing Sower sprinkles the tops of the trees and gradually sifts down
through the branches the great beautiful silver clouds sail down
the horizon like ships of a statelier age as totally without actual
existence to these men The logs the riverthose are enough to strain
all the faculties a man possesses and more

So when as now a chance combination of circumstances brings them
leisure to look about them the forest and the world of outofdoors
comes to them with a freshness impossible for the city dweller to
realise The surroundings are accustomed but they bring new messages
To most of them these impressions never reach the point of coherency
They brood and muse and expand in the actual and figurative warmth
and proffer the general opinion that it is a damn fine day

Another full half hour elapsed before the situation developed further
Then Tom Norths friend Jim who had gathered his long figure on the top
of a stump unclasped his knees and remarked that old Plug Hat was back

The men arose to their feet and peered cautiously through the brush
They saw Reed accompanied by a thickset man whom some recognised as
the sheriff of the county approach the edge of the dam A moment later
the working crew mounted to the top stacked their tools neatly resumed
their coats and jackets and departed up the road in convoy of the
sheriff

A gasp of astonishment broke from the concealed rivermen

Well Ill be damned ejaculated one What are we comin to Thats
the first time I ever see one lonesome sheriff gather in ten riverhogs
without the aid of a gatlin or an ambulance Whats the matter with
that chickenlivered bunch anyway

Orde watched them his eyes expressionless until they had disappeared
in the fringe of the forest Then he turned to the astonished group

Jim said he and you Ellis and you and you and you and you
get to work on that dam And remember this if you are arrested go
peaceably Any resistance will spoil the whole game

The men broke into mingled cheers and laughter as the full significance
of Ordes plan reached them They streamed back to the dam where they
perched proffering advice and encouragement to those about to descend

Immediately however Reed was out his eyes blazing either side his
hawk nose

Here he cried quit that Ill have ye arrested

Arrest ahead replied Orde coldly

Reed stormed back and forth for a moment then departed at full speed up
the road

Now boys get as much done as possible urged Orde We better get
back in the brush or he may try to take in the whole biling of us on
some sort of a blanket warrant

How about the other boys inquired North

I gave one of them a telegram to send to Daly replied Orde Daly
will be up to bail them out

Once more they hid in the woods and again after a longer interval the
mill owner and the sheriff reappeared Reed appeared to be expostulating
violently and a number of times pointed up river but the sheriff went
ahead stolidly to the dam summoned those working below and departed
up the road as before Reed stood uncertain until he saw the rivermen
beginning to reemerge from the brush then followed the officer at top
speed

Without the necessity of command a halfdozen men leaped down on the
apron The previous crews had made considerable progress in weakening
the heavy supports As soon as these should be cut out and the backing
removed the mere sawing through of the massive sill should carry away
the whole obstruction

Next time will decide it remarked Orde If the sheriff brings a
posse and sits down to lay for us of course we wont be able to get
near to finish the job

I didnt think that of George Morris commented Sims in an aggrieved
way He was a riverman himself once before he was sheriff

Hes got to obey orders and serve a warrant when its issued of
course replied Orde to this What did you expect

At the end of another hour which brought the time to four oclock the
sheriff made his third appearancethis time in a sidebar buggy

I wish I dared join that confab said Orde and hear whats going on
but Im afraid hed jug me sure

He wouldnt jug me spoke up Newmark Ill go down

Bully for you agreed Orde

The young man departed in his precise methodical manner picking his
way rather mincingly among the inequalities of the trail In spite of
the worn and wrinkled condition of his garments they retained something
of a city hang and smartness that sharply differentiated their wearer
from even the welldressed citizens of a smaller town They seemed to
match the refined shrewd but cold intelligence of his lean and nervous
face

About sunset he returned from a scene which the distant spectators had
watched with breathless interest It was in essence only a repetition of
the two that had preceded it but Reed had evidently gone almost to the
point of violence in his insistence and the sheriff had shaken him
off rudely Finally Morris and his six prisoners had trailed away The
sheriff and Norths friend occupied the seat of the buggy while the
other five trudged peaceably alongside Once again Reed clattered away
on his bony steed but this time ahead of the official party

With a whoop the river crew now reduced to a scant dozen rushed down
to meet the too deliberate Newmark

Well they demanded crowding about him

Reed wanted the sheriff to stay and protect the dam reported Newmark
in his brief dry manner Sheriff refused Said his duty was simply
to arrest on warrant and as often as Reed got out warrants hed serve
them Reed said then he should get a posse and hunt up Orde and the
rest of them Sheriff replied that as far as he could see the terms of
his warrant were covered by the men he found working on the dam Reed
demanded protection Sheriff said for him to get an injunction and it
would be enforced

Well thats all right interjected Orde with satisfaction Well
have her cut through before he gets that injunction and I guess Ive
got men enough here and down river to get through before were ALL
arrested

Yes said Newmark thats all very well But now hes gone to
telegraph the governor to send the troops

Orde whistled a jig tune

Kind of expected that boys said he Lets see The next train out
from ReddingTheyll be here by five in the morning at soonest Hope
itll be later

What will you do asked Newmark

Take chances replied Orde All you boys get to work Zeke he
commanded one of the cookees go up road and report if Morris comes
back I reckon this time well have to scatter if he comes after us I
hope we wont have to though Like to keep everything square on account
of this State troop business

The sun had dropped below the fringe of trees which immediately etched
their delicate outlines against a pale translucent green sky Two
straight thin columns of smoke rose from the neglected campfires
Orde glancing around him noticed these

Doctor he commanded sharply get at your grub Make some coffee
right off and bring it down Get the lanterns from the wanigan and
bring them to the dam Come on boys

Over a score of men attacked the sluiceway for by now part of the rear
crew had come down river The pond above had recovered its volume
Water was beginning to trickle over the top of the gate In a short time
progress became difficult almost impossible The men worked up to their
knees in swift water They could not see and the strokes of axe or pick
lost much of their force against the liquid Dusk fell The fringe of
the forest became mysterious in its velvet dark Silver streaks of a
supernal calm suggested the reaches of the pond Above the skys
day surface unfolded and receded and dissolved and melted away until
through the pale afterglow one saw beyond into the infinities Down
by the sluice a dozen lanterns flickered and blinked yellow against the
blueblackness of the night

After some time Orde called his crew off and opened the sluicegates
The water had become too deep for effective work and a half hours flow
would reduce the pressure The time was occupied in eating and in drying
off about the huge fire the second cookee had built close at hand

Water cold boys asked Orde

Some was his reply

Want to quit he inquired with mock solicitude

Nary quit

Ordes shout of laughter broke the night silence of the whispering
breeze and the rushing water

Well stick to em like death to a dead nigger was his comment

Newmark having extracted a kind of cardigan jacket from the bag he had
brought with him as far as the mill looked at the smooth ironblack
water and shivered

When the meal was finished the men lit their pipes and went back to
work philosophically With entire absorption in the task they dug
chopped and picked The dull sound of blows the gurgle and trickle
of the water the occasional grunt or brief comment of a riverman alone
broke the calm of evening Now that the sluicegate was down and the
water had ceased temporarily to flow over it the work went faster
Orde watching with the eye of an expert vouchsafed to the taciturn
Newmark that he thought theyd make it

Near midnight however a swaying lantern was seen approaching Orde
leaping to his feet with a curse at the boy on watch heard the sound of
wheels A moment later Dalys bulky form stepped into the illumination
of the fire

Orde wandered over to where his principal stood peering about him

Hullo said he

Oh there you are cried Daly angrily What in hell you up to here

Running logs replied Orde coolly

Running logs shouted Daly tugging at his overcoat pocket and
finally producing a muchfolded newspaper How about this

Orde unfolded the paper and lowered it to the campfire It was an extra
screaming with wood type He read it deliberately over


WAR


the headline ran


RIOTING AND BLOODSHED IN THE WOODS

RIVERMEN AND DAM OWNERS CLASH


There followed a vague and highly coloured statement to the effect that
an initial skirmish had left the field in possession of the rivermen
in spite of the sheriff and a large posse but that troops were being
rushed to the spot and that this highhanded defiance of authority
would undoubtedly soon be suppressed It concluded truthfully with the
statement that the loss of life was as yet unknown

Orde folded up the paper and handed it back

Dont you know any better than to get into that kind of a row down
here Daly had been saying Do you want to bring us up for good here
Dont you realise that this isnt the northern peninsula What are you
trying to do any way

Sure I do replied Orde placidly Come along here till I show you the
situation

Ten minutes later Daly relieved in his mind was standing by the fire
drinking hot coffee and laughing at Ordes description of Reeds plug
hat

To Ordes satisfaction the sheriff did not reappear Reed evidently now
pinned his faith to the State troops

All night the work went on the men spelling each other at intervals of
every few hours By three oclock the main abutments had been removed
The gate was then blocked to prevent its fall when its nether support
should be withdrawn and two men leaning over cautiously began at
armslength to deliver their axestrokes against the middle of the
silltimbers of the sluice itself notching each heavy beam deeply that
the force of the current might finally break it in two The night was
very dark and very still Even the night creatures had fallen into
the quietude that precedes the first morning hours The muffled spaced
blows of the axes the lowvoiced comments or directions of the workers
the crackle of the fire ashore were thrown by contrast into an undue
importance Men in blankets awaiting their turn slept close to the
blaze

Suddenly the vast silence of before dawn was broken by a loud and
exultant yell from one of the axemen At once the two scrambled to the
top of the dam The blanketed figures about the fire sprang to life
A brief instant later the snapping of wood fibres began like the rapid
explosions of infantry fire a crash and bang of timbers smote the air
and then the river exultant roaring with joy rushed from its pent
quietude into the new passage opened for it At the same moment as
though at the signal a single bird premonitor of the yet distant day
lifted up his voice clearly audible above the tumult

Orde stormed into the camp up stream his eyes bright his big voice
booming exultantly

Roll out you riverhogs he shouted to those who had worked out their
shifts earlier in the night Roll out you webfooted sons of guns and
hear the little birds sing praise

Newmark who had sat up the night through and now shivered sleepily by
the fire began to hunt around for the bedroll he had earlier in the
evening dumped down somewhere in camp

I suppose thats all said he Just a case of run logs now Ill turn
in for a little

But Orde a thick slice of bread halfway to his lips had frozen in an
attitude of attentive listening

Hark said he

Faint still in the depths of the forest the wandering morning breeze
bore to their ears a sound whose difference from the louder noises
nearer at hand alone rendered it audible

The troops exclaimed Orde

He seized a lantern and returned down the trail followed eagerly by
Newmark and every man in camp

Troops coming said Orde to Daly

The men drew a little to one side watching the dim line of the forest
dark against the paling sky Shadows seemed to stir in its blackness
They heard quite distinctly the clink of metal against metal A man rode
out of the shadow and reined up by the fire Halt commanded a harsh
voice The rivermen could make out the troopsthree or four score of
themstanding rigid at attention Reed afoot now in favour of the
commanding officer pushed forward

Who is in charge here inquired the officer crisply

I am replied Orde stepping forward

I wish to inquire sir if you have gone mad to counsel your men to
resist civil authority

I have not resisted civil authority replied Orde respectfully

It has been otherwise reported

The reports have been false The sheriff of this county has arrested
about twenty of my men singlehanded and without the slightest trouble

Mr Morris cried the officer sharply

Yes replied the sheriff

Is what this man says true

It sure is Never had so little fuss arrestin rivermen before in my
life

The officers face turned a slow brickred For a moment he said
nothing then exploded with the utmost violence

Then why the devil am I dragged up here with my men in the night he
cried Whos responsible for this insanity anyway Dont you know he
roared at Reed who that moment swung within his range of vision
that I have no standing in the presence of civil law What do you mean
getting me up here to your miserable little backwoods squabbles

Reed started to say something but was immediately cut short by the
irate captain

Ive nothing to do with that settle it in court And whats more
youll have something yourself to settle with the State About face
Forward march

The men faded into the gray light as though dissolved by it

A deep and respectful silence fell upon the men which was broken by
Ordes solemn and dramatic declamation


 The King of France and twice ten thousand men
 Marched up the hill and then marched down again


he recited then burst into his deep roar of laughter

Now you see boys he said digging his fists into his eyes if youd
put up a row what wed have got into No bluecoats in mine thank you
Well push the grub pile and then get at those logs Its a case of
floodwater now

But Reed having recovered from his astonishment had still his say

I tell ye Im not done with ye yet he threatened shaking his bony
forefinger in Ordes face Ill sue ye for damages and Ill GIT em
too

See here you old mossback said Orde thrusting his bulky form to the
fore you sue just as soon as you want to You cant get at it any too
quick to suit us But just now you get out of this camp and you stay
out Youre an old man and we dont want to be rough with you but
youre biting off more than you can chew Skedaddle

Reed hesitated waving his long arms about flaillike as though to
begin a new oration

Now do hop along urged Orde Well pay you any legitimate damages
of course but you cant expect to hang up a riverful of logs just on a
notion And were sick of you Oh hell then See here you two just
see that this man leaves camp

Orde turned square on his heel Reed after a glance at the two huge
rivermen approaching beat a retreat to his mill muttering and wrathful
still

Well goodbye boys said Daly pulling on his overcoat Ill just
get along and bail the boys out of that village calaboose I reckon
theyve had a good nights rest Be good

The fringe of trees to eastward showed clearly against the whitening
sky Hundreds of birds of all kinds sang in an ecstasy Another day
had begun Already men with pikepoles were guiding the sullen timbers
toward the sluiceway




IV


When Newmark awoke once more to interest in affairs the morning was
well spent On the river the work was going forward with the precision
of clockwork The sixfoot lowering of the sluiceway had produced a
fine current which sucked the logs down from above Men were busily
engaged in sacking them from the sides of the pond toward its centre
lest the lowering water should leave them stranded Below the dam
the jam crew was finding plenty to do in keeping them moving in the
whitewater and the shallows A fine sun tempered with a prophetic
warmth of later spring animated the scene Reed had withdrawn to the
interior of his mill and appeared to have given up the contest

Some of the logs shot away down the current running freely To these
the crews were not required to pay any attention With luck a few of
the individual timbers would float ten even twenty miles before some
chance eddy or fortuitous obstruction would bring them to rest Such
eddies and obstructions however drew a constant toll from the ranks of
the freemoving logs so that always the volume of timbers floating
with the current diminished and always the number of logs caught and
stranded along the sides of the river increased To restore these to
the faster water was the especial province of the last and most expert
crewthe rear

Orde discovered about noon that the jam crew was having its troubles
Immediately below Reeds dam ran a long chute strewn with boulders
which was alternately a shallow or a stretch of whitewater according
as the stream rose or fell Ordinarily the logs were flushed over this
declivity by opening the gate behind which a head of water had
been accumulated Now however the efficiency of the gate had been
destroyed Orde early discovered that he was likely to have trouble in
preventing the logs rushing through the chute from grounding into a bad
jam on the rapids below

For a time the jam crew succeeded in keeping the wings clear In the
centre of the stream however a small jam formed like a pier Along
the banks logs grounded and were rolled over by their own momentum into
places so shallow as to discourage any hope of refloating them unless
by main strength As the sluicing of the nine or ten million feet that
constituted this particular drive went forward the situation rapidly
became worse

Tom weve got to get floodwater unless we want to run into an awful
job there said Orde to the foreman I wonder if we cant drop that
gate way down to get something for a head

The two men examined the chute and the sluicegate attentively for some
time

If we could clear out the splinters and rubbish we might spike a
couple of saplings on each side for the gate to slide down into
speculated North Might try her on

The logs were held up in the pond and a crew of men set to work to cut
away as well as they might in the rush of water the splintered ends of
the old sill and apron It was hard work Newmark watching thought it
impracticable The current rendered footing impossible so all the work
had to be done from above Wet wood gripped the long saws vicelike
so that a mans utmost strength could scarcely budge them The water
deadened the force of axeblows Nevertheless with the sure persistence
of the riverman they held to it Orde watching them a few moments
satisfied himself that they would succeed and so departed up river to
take charge of the rear

This crew he found working busily among some overflowed woods They
were herding the laggards of the flock The subsidence of the water
consequent upon the opening of the sluicegate had left stranded and in
shallows many hundreds of the logs These the men sometimes waist deep
in the icy water owing to the extreme inequality of the bottom were
rolling over and over with their peavies until once more they floated
Some few the rivermen were forced to carry bodily ten men to a side
the peavies clamped in as handles When once they were afloat the task
became easier From the advantage of deadwood stumps or other logs
the sackers pushed the unwieldy timbers forward leaping splashing
heaving shoving until at last the steady current of the main river
seized the logs and bore them away With marvellous skill they topped
the dripping bobby rolling timbers treading them over and over back
and forth in unconscious preservation of equilibrium

There was a good deal of noise and fun at the rear The crew had been
divided and a half worked on either side the river A rivalry developed
as to which side should advance fastest in the sacking It became
a race Momentary success in getting ahead of the other fellow was
occasion for exultant crowing while a mishap called forth ironic cheers
and catcalls from the rival camp Just as Orde came tramping up the
trail one of the rivermens caulks failed to bite on an unusually
smooth barked surface His foot slipped the log rolled he tried in
vain to regain his balance and finally fell in with a heavy splash

The entire river suspended work to send up a howl of delight As the
unfortunate crawled out dripping from head to foot he was greeted by
a flood of sarcasm and profane inquiry that left no room for even his
acknowledged talents of repartee Cursing and ashamed he made his way
ashore over the logs spirting water at every step There he wrung out
his woollen clothes as dry as he could and resumed work

Hardly had Orde the opportunity to look about at the progress making
however before he heard his name shouted from the bank Looking up to
his surprise he saw the solemn cook waving a frantic dishtowel at him
Nothing could induce the cook to attempt the logs

What is it Charlie asked Orde leaping ashore and stamping the loose
water from his boots

Its all off confided the cook pessimistically Its no good Hes
stopped us now

Whats off Whos stopped what

Reed Hes druv the men from the dam with a shotgun We might as well
quit

Shotgun hey exclaimed Orde Well the old son of a gun He thought
a moment his lips puckered as though to whistle then as usual he
laughed amusedly Lets go take a look at the army said he

He swung away at a round pace followed rather breathlessly by the cook
The trail led through the brush across a little flat point up over a
high bluff where the river swung in down to another point and across a
pole trail above a marsh to camp

A pole trail consists of saplings laid end to end and supported three
or four feet above wet places by means of sawbucklike structures at
their extremities To a riverman or a tightrope dancer they are easy
walks All others must proceed cautiously in contrite memory of their
sins

Orde marched across the first two lengths confidently enough Then he
heard a splash and lamentations Turning he perceived Charlie covered
with mud in the act of clambering up one of the small trestles

Aint got no caulks ran the lamentations The  of a  of a
poletrail anyways

He walked ahead gingerly threw his hands aloft bent forward then
suddenly protruded his stomach held out one foot in front of him
spasmodically half turned and then realising the case hopeless wilted
like a wet rag to clasp the pole trail both by arm and leg This saved
him from falling off altogether but swung him underneath where he
hung like the sloths in the picturebooks A series of violent wriggles
brought him redfaced and panting astride the pole whence his
feelings beyond mere speech he sadly eyed his precious derby which
lay crown up in the mud below

Orde contemplated the spectacle seriously

Sorry I havent got time to enjoy you just now Charlie he remarked
Id take it slower if I were you

He departed catching fragments of vows anent never going on any more
errands for nobody and getting his time if ever again he went away from
his wanigan

Orde stopped short outside the fringe of brush to utter another
irrepressible chuckle of amusement

The centre of the dam was occupied by Reed The old man was still in
full regalia his plug hat fuzzier than ever and thrust even farther
back on his head his coattails and loose trousers flapping at his
every movement as he paced back and forth with military precision Over
his shoulder he carried a long percussionlock shotgun Not thirty
feet away perched along the bank for all the world like a row of
cormorants sat the rivermen watching him solemnly and in silence

Whats the matter inquired Orde approaching

The old man surveyed him with a snort of disgust

If the law of the land dont protect me Ill protect myself sir he
proclaimed I give ye fair warning I aint agoing to have my property
interfered with no more

But surely said Orde we have a right to run our logs through Its
an open river

And hev ye been running your logs through cried the old man
excitedly Hev ye First off ye begin to tear down my dam and then
when the river begins aroarin and aragin through then you tamper
with my improvements furthermore alowerin the gate and otherwise
amodifyin my structure

Orde stepped forward to say something further Immediately Reed wheeled
his thumb on the hammer

All right old Spirit of 76 replied Orde Dont shoot Ill come
down

He walked back to the waiting row smiling quizzically

Well you calamity howlers what do you think of it

Nobody answered but everybody looked expectant

Think hed shoot inquired Orde of Tom North

I know he would replied North earnestly That crazyheaded kind are
just the fellers to rip loose

I think myself he probably would agreed Orde

Surely spoke up Newmark whatever the status of the damage suits
you have the legal right to run your logs

Orde rolled a quizzical eye in his direction

Perfectly correct son he drawled but were engaged in the happy
occupation of getting out logs By the time the law was all adjusted and
a head of steam up the waterd be down In this game you get out logs
first and think about law afterward

How about legal damages insisted Newmark

Legal damages scoffed Orde Legal damages Why we count legal
damages as part of our regular expenseslike potatoes Its lucky its
so he added If anybody paid any attention to legal technicalities
thered never be a log delivered A man always has enemies

Well what are you going to do persisted Newmark

Orde thrust back his felt hat and ran his fingers through his short
crisp hair

There youve got me he confessed but if necessary well pile the
old warrior

He walked to the edge of the dam and stood looking down current For
perhaps a full minute he remained there motionless his hat clinging to
one side his hand in his hair Then he returned to the grimly silent
rivermen

Boys he commanded briefly get your peavies and come along

He led the way past the mill to the shallows below

Theres a trifle of wading to do he announced Bring down two
logsfairly bigand hold them by that old snag he ordered Whoaup
Easy Hold them end onno pointing up streamfix em about ten foot
apartthats it George drive a couple of stakes each side of them
to hold em Correct Now run down a couple dozen more and pile them
across those twoside on to the stream of course Roll em upthats
the ticket

Orde had been splashing about in the shallow water showing where
each timber was to be placed He drew back eyeing the result with
satisfaction It looked rather like a small and bristly pier

Next he cast his eye about and discovered a partially submerged boulder
on a line with the newly completed structure Against this he braced
the ends of two more logs on which he once more caused to be loaded
at right angles many timbers An old stub near shore furnished him the
basis of a third pier He staked a thirtyinch butt for a fourth and
so on until the piers in conjunction with the small centre jam already
mentioned extended quite across the river

All this was accomplished in a very short time and immediately below
the mill but beyond sight from the sluicegate of the dam

Now boys commanded Orde shove off some shore logs and let them
come down

Well have a jam sure objected Purdy stupidly

No my son would we mocked Orde I surely hope not

The stray logs floating down with the current the rivermen caught and
arranged to the best possible advantage about the improvised piers
A good riverman understands the correlation of forces represented by
sawlogs and waterpressure He knows how to look for the keylog in
breaking jams and by the inverse reasoning when need arises he can
form a jam as expertly as Koosyoonek himselfthat bad little god
who brings about the disagreeable and undesiredwho hides our pipes
steals our last match and brings rain on the just when they want to go
fishing

So in ten seconds after the shore logs began drifting down from above
the jam was taking shape Slowly it formed low and broad Then as the
water gathered pressure the logs began to slip over one another The
weight of the topmost sunk those beneath to the bed of the stream This
to a certain extent dammed back the water Immediately the pressure
increased More logs were piled on top The piers locked the structure
Below the improvised dam the water fell almost to nothing and above it
swirling in eddies grumbling fiercely bubbling gurgling searching
busily for an opening the river turned back on itself gathered its
swollen and angry forces

That will do boys said Orde with satisfaction

He led the way to the bank and sat down The men followed his example
Every moment the water rose and each instant as more logs came down
the current the jam became more formidable

Nothing can stand that pressure breathed Newmark fascinated

The bigger the pressure the tighter she locks replied Orde lighting
his pipe

The high bank where the men sat lay well above the reach of the water
Not so the flat on which stood Reeds mill In order to take full
advantage of the waterpower developed by the dam the old man had
caused his structure to be built nearly at a level with the stream
Now the river backing up rapidly overflowed this flat As the jam
tightened by its own weight and the accumulation of logs the water
fairly jumped from the lowest floor of the mill to the one above

Orde had not long to wait for Reeds appearance In less than five
minutes the old man descended on the group somewhat of his martial air
abated and something of a vague anxiety manifest in his eye

Whats the matter here he demanded

Matter inquired Orde easily Oh nothing much just a little jam

But its flooding my mill

So I perceive replied Orde striking a match

Well why dont you break it

Not interested

The old warrior ran up the bank to where he could get a good view of his
property The water was pouring into the firstfloor windows

Here he cried running back Ive a lot of grain upstairs Itll be
ruined

Not interested repeated Orde

Reed was rapidly losing control of himself

But Ive got a lot of money invested here he shouted You miserable
blackguard youre ruining me

Orde replaced his pipe

Reed ran back and forth frantically disappeared returned bearing an
antiquated pikepole and singlehanded and alone attacked the jam

Astonishment and delight held the rivermen breathless for a moment Then
a roar of laughter drowned even the noise of the waters Men pounded
each other on the back rolled over and over clutching handfuls of
earth struggled weak and redfaced for breath as they saw against the
skyline of the bristling jam the lank flapping figure with the old
plug hat pushing frantically against the immovable statics of a mighty
power The exasperation of delay the anxiety lest success be lost
through the mulish and narrowminded obstinacy of one man the
resentment against another obstacle not to be foreseen and not to be
expected in a task redundantly supplied with obstacles of its ownthese
found relief at last

By Jove breathed Newmark softly to himself Don Quixote and the
windmills Then he added vindictively The old fool although of
course the drive was not his personal concern

Only Orde seemed to see the other side And on Orde the responsibility
uncertainty and vexation had borne most heavily for the success of the
undertaking was in his hands With a few quick leaps he had gained the
old mans side

Look here Reed he said kindly you cant break this jam Come
ashore now and let up Youll kill yourself

Reed turned to him a wild light in his eye

Break it he pleaded Youre ruining me Ive got all my money in
that mill

Well said Orde weve got a lot of money in our logs too You
havent treated us quite right

Reed glanced frantically toward the flood up stream

Come said Orde taking him gently by the arm Theres no reason you
and I shouldnt get along together all right Maybe were both a little
hardheaded Lets talk it over

He led the old man ashore and out of earshot of the rivermen

At the end of ten minutes he returned

Wars over boys he shouted cheerfully Get in and break that jam

At once the crew swarmed across the log barrier to a point above the
centre pier This they attacked with their peavies rolling the top logs
off into the current below In less than no time they had torn out
quite a hole in the top layer The river rushed through the opening
Immediately the logs in the wings were tumbled in from either side
At first the men had to do all of the work but soon the river itself
turned to their assistance Timbers creaked and settled or rose
slightly buoyant as the water loosened the tangle Men trod on the edge
of expectation Constantly the logs shifted and as constantly the men
shifted also avoiding the upheavals and grindings together wary eyes
estimating the correlation of the forces into whose crushing reach a
single misstep would bring them The movement accelerated each instant
as the music of the play hastens to the climax Wood fibres smashed
The whole mass seemed to sink down and forward into a boiling of waters
Then with a creak and a groan the jam moved hesitated moved again
finally urged by the frantic river went out in a majestic crashing and
battering of logs

At the first movement Newmark expected the rivermen to make their
escape Instead they stood at attention their peavies poised watching
cateyed the symptoms of the break Twice or thrice several of the
men observing something not evident to Newmarks unpractised eye ran
forward used their peavies vigorously for a moment or so and stood
back to watch the result Only at the very last when it would seem that
some of them must surely he caught did the riverjacks using their
peavyshafts as balancing poles zigzag calmly to shore across the
plunging logs Newmark seemed impressed

That was a close shave said he to the last man ashore

What inquired the riverman Didnt see it Somebody fall down

Why no explained Newmark getting in off those logs without getting
caught

Oh said the man indifferently turning away

The going out of the jam drained the water from the lower floors of the
mill the upper stories and the grain were still safe

By evening the sluicegate had been roughly provided with pole guides
down which to slide to the bed of the river The following morning saw
the work going on as methodically as ever During the night a very
good head of water had gathered behind the lowered gate The rear crew
brought down the afterguard of logs to the pond The sluicers with their
long pikepoles thrust the logs into the chute The jam crew scattered
for many miles along the lower stretches kept the drive going running
out over the surface of the river like waterbugs to thrust apart logs
threatening to lock leaning for hours on the shafts of their peavies
watching contemplatively the orderly ranks as they drifted by sleepy
on the bosom of the river occasionally gathering as the filling of
the river gave warning to break a jam By the end of the second day the
pond was clear and as Charlies wanigan was drifting toward the chute
the first of Johnsons drive floated into the head of the pond




V


Charlies wanigan in case you do not happen to know what such a thing
may be was a scow about twenty feet long by ten wide It was
very solidly constructed of hewn timbers square at both ends was
inconceivably clumsy and weighed an unbelievable number of pounds
When loaded it carried all the bedrolls tents provisions cooking
utensils tools and a chest of tobacco clothes and other minor
supplies It was managed by Charlie and his two cookees by means of
pikepoles and a long sweep at either end The pikepoles assured
progress when the current slacked the sweeps kept her headon when
drifting with the stream

Charlies temperament was pessimistic at best When the wanigan was
to be moved he rose fairly to the heights of what might be called
destructive prophecy

The packing began before the men had finished breakfast Shortly after
daylight the wanigan pushed strongly from shore by the pikepoles
was drifting toward the chute When the heavy scow threatened to turn
sideon the sweeps at either end churned the water frantically in an
endeavour to straighten her out Sometimes by a misunderstanding they
worked against each other Then Charlie raging from one to the other of
his satellites frothed and roared commands and vituperations His voice
rose to a shriek The cookees bewildered by so much violence lost
their heads completely Then Charlie abruptly fell to an exaggerated
calm He sat down amidships on a pile of bags and gazed with
ostentatious indifference out over the pond Finally in a voice fallen
almost to a whisper and with an elaborate politeness Charlie proffered
a request that his assistants acquire the sense God gave a rooster
Newmark who had elected to accompany the wanigan on its voyage
evidently found it vastly amusing for his eyes twinkled behind his
glasses As the wanigan neared the sluice through which it must shoot
the floodwater the excitement mounted to fever pitch The water boiled
under the strokes of the long steering oars The air swirled with the
multitude and vigour of Charlies commands As many of the driving crew
as were within distance gathered to watch It was a supreme moment As
Newmark looked at the smooth rim of the water sucking into the chute he
began to wonder why he had come

However the noble ship was pointed right at last and caught the faster
water headon Even Charlie managed to look cheerful for an instant and
to grin at his passenger as he wiped his forehead with a very old red
handkerchief

All right now he shouted

Zeke and his mate took in the oars The wanigan shot forward below the
gate

WHACK BUMP BANG and the scow stopped so suddenly that its four men
plunged forward in a miscellaneous heap while Zeke narrowly escaped
going overboard Almost immediately the water backed up behind the
stern began to overflow into the boat Newmark clearing his vision
as well as he could for lack of his glasses saw that the scow had
evidently run her bow on an obstruction and had been brought to a
standstill square beneath the sluicegate Men seemed to be running
toward them The water was beginning to flow the entire length of the
boat Various lighter articles shot past him and disappeared over the
side Charlie had gone crazy and was grabbing at these quite uselessly
for as fast as he had caught one thing he let it go in favour of
another The cookees retaining some small degree of coolness were
pushing uselessly with pikepoles

Newmark had an inspiration The more important matters such as the
mens clothesbags the rolls of bedding and the heavier supplies of
provisions had not yet cut loose from their moorings although the
rapid backing of the water threatened soon to convert the wanigan into
a chute for nearly the full volume of the current He seized one of the
long oars thrust the blade under the edge of a thwart astern laid the
shaft of the oar across the cargo and by resting his weight on the
handle attempted to bring it down to bind the contents of the wanigan
to their places The cookees saw what he was about and came to his
assistance Together they succeeded in bending the long hickory sweep
far enough to catch its handleend under another forward thwart The
second oar was quickly locked alongside the first and not a moment too
soon A rush of water forced them all to cling for their lives The poor
old wanigan was almost buried by the river

But now help was at hand Two or three rivermen appeared at the edge of
the chute A moment later old man Reed ran up carrying a rope This
after some difficulty was made fast to the bow of the wanigan A dozen
men ran with the end of it to a position of vantage from which they
might be able to pull the bow away from the sunken obstruction but
Orde appearing above called a halt After consultation with
Reed another rope was brought and the end of it tossed down to the
shipwrecked crew Orde pointed to the stern of the boat revolving his
hands in pantomime to show that the wanigan would be apt to upset if
allowed to get sideon when freed A short rope led to the top of the
dam allowed the bow to be lifted free of the obstruction a cable astern
prevented the current from throwing her broadside to the rush of waters
another cable from the bow led her in the way she should go Ten
minutes later she was pulled ashore out of the eddy below very much
waterlogged and manned by a drenched and disgruntled crew

But Orde allowed them little chance for lamentation

Hard luck he said briefly Hope you havent lost much Now get a
move on you and bail out Youve got to get over the shallows while this
head is on

Thats all the thanks you get grumbled Charlie to himself and the
other three as Orde moved away Work slave get up in the night
drownd yourself

He happily discovered that the pails under the forward thwart had not
been carried away and all started in to bail It was a backbreaking
job and consumed the greater part of two hours Even at the end of that
time the wanigan though dry of loose water floated but sluggishly

Bout two ton of water in them bedrolls and turkeys grumbled
Charlie Well get at it

Newmark soon discovered that the progress of the wanigan was looked upon
in the light of a sideshow by the rivermen Its appearance was
signal for shouts of delighted and ironic encouragement its
tribulationswhich at first in the whitewater were manythe
occasion for unsympathetic and unholy joy Charlie looked on all
spectators as enemies Part of the time he merely glowered Part of the
time he tried to reply in kind To his intense disgust he was taken
seriously in neither case

In a couple of hours run the wanigan had overtaken and left far behind
the rear of the drive All about floated the logs caroming gently one
against the other shifting and changing the pattern of their brown
against the blue of the water The current flowed strongly and smoothly
but without obstruction Everything went well The banks slipped by
silently and mysteriously like the unrolling of a panoramalittle
strips of marshland stretches of woodland where the great trees leaned
out over the river thickets of overflowed swampland with the water
rising and draining among roots in a strange regularity of its own The
sun shone warm There was no wind Newmark wrung out his outer
garments and basked below the gunwale Zeke and his companion pulled
spasmodically on the sweeps Charlie having regained his equanimity
together with his old brown derby which he came upon floating sodden
in an eddy marched up and down the broad gunwale with his pikepole
thrusting away such logs as threatened interference

Well said he at last we better make camp Well be down in the jam
pretty soon

The cookees abandoned the sweeps in favour of more pikepoles By
pushing and pulling on the logs floating about them they managed to
work the wanigan in close to the bank

Charlie a coil of rope in his hand surveyed the prospects

Well stop right down there by that little knoll he announced

He leaped ashore made a turn around a tree and braced himself to snub
the boat but unfortunately he had not taken into consideration the
two ton of water soaked up by the cargo The weight of the craft
relentlessly dragged him forward In vain he braced and struggled The
end of the rope came to the tree he clung for a moment then let go
and ran around the tree to catch it before it should slip into the
water

By this time the wanigan had caught the stronger current at the bend and
was gathering momentum Charlie tried to snub at a sapling and broke
the sapling on a stub and uprooted the stub Down the banks and
through the brush he tore at the end of his rope clinging desperately
trying at every solid tree to stop the career of his runaway but in
every instance being forced by the danger of jamming his hands to let
go Again he lost his derby The landscape was a blur Dimly he made
out the howls of laughter as the outfit passed a group of rivermen Then
abruptly a ravine yawned before him and he let go just in time to save
himself a fall The wanigan trailing her rope drifted away

Nor did she stop until she had overtaken the jam There her momentum
reduced by the closer crowding of the logs she slowed down enough so
that Newmark and the cookees managed to work her to the bank and make
her fast

That evening after the wanigans crew had accomplished a hard
afternoons work pitching camp and drying blankets the first of the
rear drifted in very late after a vain search for camp farther up
stream

For Gods sake Charlie growled one its a wonder you wouldnt run
through to Redding and be done with it

Whereupon Charlie who had been preternaturally calm all the afternoon
uttered a shriek of rage and with a carvingknife chased that man out
into the brush Nor would he be appeased to the point of getting supper
until Orde himself had intervened

Well said Orde to Newmark later around the campfire how does
riverdriving strike you

It is extremely interesting replied Newmark

Like to join the wanigan crew permanently

No thanks returned Newmark drily

Well stay with us as long as youre having a good time invited Orde
heartily but turning away from his rather uncommunicative visitor

Thank you Newmark acknowledged this I believe I will

Well Tommy called Orde across the fire to North I reckon weve got
to rustle some more supplies That shipwreck of ours today mighty near
cleaned us out of some things Lucky Charlie held his head and locked in
the bedding with those sweeps or wed have been strapped

I didnt do it grumbled Charlie It was him

Oh Orde congratulated Newmark Good work Im tickled to death you
belonged to that crew

That old mossback Reed was right on deck with his rope remarked
Johnny Simms That was pretty decent of him

Old skunk growled North He lost us two days with his damn nonsense
You let him off too easy Jack

Oh hes a poor old devil replied Orde easily He means well enough
Thats the way the Lord made him He cant help how hes made




VI


During the thirtythree days of the drive Newmark to the surprise
of everybody stayed with the work Some of these days were very
disagreeable April rains are cold and persistentthe proverbs as to
showers were made for another latitude Drenched garments are bad enough
when a man is moving about and has daylight but when night falls
and the work is over he likes a dry place and a change with which to
comfort himself Dry places there were none Even the interior of the
tents became sodden by continual exits and entrances of dripping men
while dry garments speedily dampened in the shiftings of camp which in
the broader reaches of the lower river took place nearly every day Men
worked in soaked garments slept in damp blankets Charlie cooked only
by virtue of persistence The rivermen ate standing up as close to
the sputtering roaring fires as they could get Always the work went
forward

But there were other times when a golden sun rose each morning a little
earlier on a green and joyous world The river ran blue Migratory birds
fled busily northwardrobins flutevoiced bluebirds warblers of
many species sparrows of different kinds shore birds and ducks the
sweetsonged thrushes Little tepid breezes wandered up and down
warm in contrast to the faint snowchill that even yet lingered in the
shadows Sounds carried clearly so that the shouts and banter of the
rivermen were plainly audible up the reaches of the river Ashore moist
and aggressive green things were pushing up through the watery earth
from which in shade the last frost had not yet departed At camp the
fires roared invitingly Charlies grub was hot and grateful The fir
beds gave dreamless sleep

Newmark followed the work of the logdrive with great interest All day
long he tramped back and forthon jam one day on rear the next He
never said much but watched keenly and listened to the mens banter
both on the work and about the evenings fire as though he enjoyed
it Gradually the men got used to him and ceased to treat him as an
outsider His thin eager face his steelblue inquiring eyes behind
the glasses his gray felt hat his lank tense figure in its gray
became a familiar feature They threw remarks to him to which he
replied briefly and drily When anything interesting was going on
somebody told him about it Then he hurried to the spot no matter how
distant it might be He used always the river trail he never attempted
to ride the logs

He seemed to depend most on observation for he rarely asked any
questions What few queries he had to proffer he made to Orde himself
waiting sometimes until evening to interview that busy and goodnatured
individual Then his questions were direct and to the point They
related generally to the advisability of something he had seen done
only rarely did they ask for explanation of the work itself That
Newmark seemed capable of puzzling out for himself

The drive as has been said went down as far as Redding in thirtythree
days It had its share of tribulation The men worked fourteen and
sixteen hours at times Several bad jams relieved the monotony Three
dams had to be sluiced through Problems of mechanics arose to be solved
on the spot problems that an older civilisation would have attacked
deliberately and with due respect for the seriousness of the situation
and the dignity of engineering Orde solved them by a roughandready
but very effective rule of thumb He built and abandoned structures
which would have furnished opportunity for a winters discussion to some
committees just as earlier in the work the loggers had built through
a rough country some hundreds of miles of road better than railroad
grade solid in foundation and smooth as a turnpike the quarter of
which would have occupied the average county board of supervisors
for five years And while he was at it Orde kept his men busy and
satisfied Your whitewater birler is not an easy citizen to handle Yet
never once did the boss appear hurried or flustered Always he
wandered about his hands in his pockets chewing a twig his round
windreddened face puckered humorously his blue eyes twinkling his
square burly form lazily relaxed He seemed to meet his men almost
solely on the plane of goodnatured chaffing Yet the work was done and
done efficiently and Orde was the man responsible

The drive of which Orde had charge was to be delivered at the booms of
Morrison and Daly a mile or so above the city of Redding Redding was a
thriving place of about thirty thousand inhabitants situated on a long
rapids some forty miles from Lake Michigan The waterpower developed
from the rapids explained Reddings existence Most of the logs floated
down the river were carried through to the village at the lake coast
where strung up the river for eight or ten miles stood a dozen or so
big sawmills with concomitant booms yards and wharves Morrison and
Daly however had built a saw and planing mill at Redding where
they supplied most of the local trade and that of the surrounding
countryside

The drive then was due to break up as soon as the logs should be
safely impounded

The last camp was made some six or eight miles above the mill From that
point a good proportion of the rivermen eager for a taste of the town
tramped away down the road to return early in the morning more or less
drunk but faithful to their job One or two did not return

Among the revellers was the cook Charlie commonly called The Doctor
The rivermen early worked off the effects of their rather wild spree
and turned up at noon chipper as larks Not so the cook He moped about
disconsolately all day and in the evening after his work had been
finished he looked so much like a chicken with the pip that Ordes
attention was attracted

Got that darkbrown taste Charlie he inquired with mock solicitude

The cook mournfully shook his head

Large head Lets feel your pulse Stick out your tongue sonny

I aint been drinking I tell you growled Charlie

Drinking expostulated Orde horrified Of course not I hope none
of MY boys ever take a drink But that lemonpop didnt agree with your
stomachnow did it Charlie

I tell you I only had two glasses of beer cried Charlie goaded and
I can prove it by Johnny Challan

Orde turned to survey the pinkcheeked embarrassed young boy thus
designated

How many glasses did Johnny Challan have he inquired

He didnt drink none to speak of spoke up the boy

Then why this joyless demeanour begged Orde

Charlie grumbled fiercely inarticulate but Johnny Challan interposed
with a chuckle of enjoyment

He got bunked

Tell us cried Orde delightedly

It was down at McNeills place explained Johnny Challan encouraged
by the interest of his audience They was a couple of sports there who
throwed out three cards on the table and bet you couldnt pick the jack
They showed you where the jack was before they throwed and it surely
looked like a picnic but it wasnt

Threecard monte said Newmark

How much asked Simms

About fifty dollars replied the boy

Orde turned on the disgruntled cook

And you had fifty in your turkey camping with this outfit of hard
citizens he cried You ought to lose it

Johnny Challan was explaining to his companions exactly how the game was
played

Its a case of keep your eye on the card I should think said big Tim
Nolan If you got a quick enough eye to see him flip the card around
you ought to be able to pick her

Thats what this sport said agreed Challan Your eye agin my hand
says he

Well Id like to take a try at her mused Tim

But at this point Newmark broke into the discussion Have you a pack of
cards he asked in his dry incisive manner

Somebody rummaged in a turkey and produced the remains of an old deck

I dont believe this is a full deck said he and I think theys part
of two decks in it

I only want three assured Newmark reaching his hand for the pack

The men crowded around close those in front squatting those behind
looking over their shoulders

Newmark cleared a crackerbox of drying socks and drew it to him

These three are the cards he said speaking rapidly There is the
jack of hearts I pass my handsso Pick the jack one of you he
challenged leaning back from the crackerbox on which lay the three
cards back up Any of you he urged You North

Thus directly singled out the foreman leaned forward and rather
hesitatingly laid a blunt forefinger on one of the bits of pasteboard

Without a word Newmark turned it over It was the ten of spades

Let me try interposed Tim Nolan pressing his big shoulders forward
I bet I know which it was that time and I bet I can pick her next
time

Oh yes you BET shrugged Newmark And thats where the cardsharps
get you fellows every time Well pick it said he again deftly
flipping the cards

Nolan who had watched keenly indicated one without hesitation Again
it proved to be the ten of spades

Anybody else ambitious inquired Newmark Everybody was ambitious
and the young man with inexhaustible patience threw out the cards the
corners of his mouth twitching sardonically at each wrong guess

At length he called a halt

By this time Id have had all your money he pointed out Now Ill
pick the jack

For the last time he made his swift passes and distributed the cards
Then quite calmly without disturbing the three on the crackerbox he
held before their eyes the jack of hearts

An exclamation broke from the interested group Tim Nolan who was the
nearest leaned forward and turned over the three on the board They
were the eight of diamonds and two tens of spades

Thats how the thing is worked nine times out of ten announced
Newmark Once in a while youll run against a straight game but not
often

But you showed us the jack every time before you throwed them puzzled
Johnny Simms

Sleight of hand explained Newmark The simplest kind of palming

Well Charlie said big Tim looks to me as if you had just about as
much chance as a snowball in hell

Whered you get onto doing all that Newmark inquired North You
aint a tin horn yourself

Newmark laughed briefly Not I said he I learned a lot of those
tricks from a travelling magician in college

During this demonstration Orde had sat well in the background his chin
propped on his hand watching intently all that was going on After
the comment and exclamations following the exposure of the method had
subsided he spoke

Boys said he how game are you to get Charlies money backand then
some

Try us returned big Tim

This games at McNeills and McNeills is a tough hole warned Orde
Maybe everything will go peaceful and maybe not And you boys that go
with me have got to keep sober There isnt going to be any row unless
I say so and Im not taking any contract to handle a lot of drunken
riverhogs as well as go against a game

All right agreed Nolan Im with you

The thirty or so men of the rear crew then in camp signified their
intention to stay by the procession

You cant make those sharps disgorge counselled Newmark At the
first look of trouble they will light out They have it all fixed Force
wont do you much goodand may get some of you shot

Im not going to use force denied Orde Im just going to play their
game But I bet I can make it go Only I sort of want the moral support
of the boys

I tell you you CANT win cried Newmark disgustedly Its a brace
game pure and simple

I dont know about its being pure replied Orde drolly but its
simple enough if you know how to make the wheels go round How is it
boyswill you back my play

And such was their confidence that in face of Newmarks demonstration
they said they would




VII


After the men had been paid off perhaps a dozen of them hung around
the yards awaiting evening and the rendezvous named by Orde The rest
drifted away full of good intentions but did not show up again Orde
himself was busy up to the last moment but finally stamped out of the
office just as the boardinghouse bell rang for supper He surveyed what
remained of his old crew and grinned

Well boys ready for trouble he greeted them Come on

They set out up the long reach of Water Street their steel caulks
biting deep into the pitted boardwalks

For nearly a mile the street was flanked solely by lumberyards small
mills and factories Then came a strip of unimproved land followed
immediately by the wooden ramshackle structures of Hells HalfMile

In the old days every town of any size had its Hells HalfMile or the
equivalent Saginaw boasted of its Catacombs Muskegon Alpena Port
Huron Ludington had their Pens White Rows River Streets
Kilyubbin and so forth They supported row upon row of saloons alike
stuffy and squalid gambling hells of all sorts refreshment parlours
where drinks were served by dozens of pretty waitergirls and huge
dancehalls

The proprietors of these places were a bold and unscrupulous lot
In their everyday business they had to deal with the most dangerous
roughandtumble fighters this country has ever known with men bubbling
over with the joy of life ready for quarrel if quarrel also spelled
fun drinking deep and heavyhanded and fearless in their cups But
each of these rivermen had two or three hundred dollars to blow as
soon as possible The pickings were good Men got rich very quickly at
this business And there existed this great advantage in favour of the
divekeeper nobody cared what happened to a riverman You could pound
him over the head with a lead pipe or drug his drink or choke him to
insensibility or rob him and throw him out into the street or even
drop him tidily through a trapdoor into the river flowing conveniently
beneath Nobody botheredunless of course the affair was so bungled
as to become public The police knew enough to stay away when the drive
hit town They would have been annihilated if they had not The only fly
in the divekeepers ointment was that the riverman would fight back

And fight back he did until from one end of his street to the other he
had left the battered evidences of his skill as a warrior His constant
heavy lifting made him as hard as nails and as strong as a horse the
continual demand on his agility in riding the logs kept him active and
prevented him from becoming musclebound in his wild heart was not the
least trace of fear of anything that walked crawled or flew And
he was as tireless as machinery and apparently as indifferent to
punishment as a man cast in iron

Add to this a happy and complete disregard of consequencesto himself
or othersof anything he did and in his own words he was a hard man
to nick

As yet the season was too early for much joy along Hells HalfMile
Ordes little crew and the forty or fifty men of the drive that had
preceded him constituted the rank and file at that moment in town A
little later when all the drives on the river should be in and those
of its tributaries and the men still lingering at the woods camps at
least five hundred woodsweary men would be turned loose Then Hells
HalfMile would awaken in earnest from its hibernation The lights would
blaze from day to day From its opened windows would blare the music
the cries of men and women the shuffle of feet the noise of fighting
the shrieks of wild laughter curses deep and frank and unashamed songs
broken and interrupted Crews of men arms locked would surge up and
down the narrow sidewalks their little felt hats cocked one side
their heads back their fearless eyes challenging the devil and all his
worksand getting the challenge accepted Girls would flit across the
lit windows like shadows before flames or stand in the doorways hailing
the men jovially by name And every few moments above the roar of this
wild inferno would sound the sudden crash and the dull blows of combat
Only never was heard the bark of the pistol The fighting was fierce
and it included kicking with the sharp steel bootcaulks biting and
gouging but it barred knives and firearms And when Hells HalfMile
was thus in full eruption the citizens of Redding stayed away from
Water Street after dark Drives in said they and had business
elsewhere And the next group of rivermen hurrying toward the fun
broke into an eager dogtrot Taking the old town apart tonight they
told each other Lets get in the game

Tonight however the street was comparatively quiet The saloons were
of modified illumination In many of them men stood drinking but in
a sociable rather than a hilarious mood Old friends of the two
drives were getting together for a friendly glass The barkeepers were
listlessly wiping the bars The pretty waitergirls gossiped with each
other and yawned behind their hands From several doorways Ordes little
compact group was accosted by the burly saloonkeepers

Hullo boys said they invariably glad to see you back Come in and
have a drink on me

Well these men knew that one free drink would mean a dozen paid for But
the rivermen merely shook their heads

Huh sneered one of the girls Thems no riverjacks Thems just off
the hay trail I bet

But even this timehonoured and generally effective taunt was ignored

In the middle of the third block Orde wheeled sharp to the left down a
dark and dangerouslooking alley Another turn to the right brought him
into a very narrow street Facing this street stood a threestory wooden
structure into which led a higharched entrance up a broad halfflight
of wooden steps This was McNeills

As Orde and his men turned into the narrow street a figure detached
itself from the shadow and approached Orde uttered an exclamation

You here Newmark he cried

Yes replied that young man I want to see this through

With those clothes marvelled Orde Its a wonder some of these thugs
havent held you up long ago Ill get Johnny here to go back with you
to the main street

No argued Newmark I want to go in with you

Its dangerous explained Orde Youre likely to get slugged

I can stand it if you can returned Newmark

I doubt it said Orde grimly However its your funeral Come on if
you want to

McNeills lower story was given over entirely to drinking A bar ran
down all one side of the room Dozens of little tables occupied the
floor Pretty waitergirls were prepared to serve drinks at these
latterand to share in them at a commission The second floor was a
theatre and the third a dancehall Beneath the building were still
viler depths From this basement the riverman and the shanty boy
generally graduated penniless and perhaps unconscious to the street
Now your lumberjack did not customarily arrive at this stage without
more or less lively doings en route therefore McNeills maintained a
force of fighters They were burly sodden men in striking contrast to
the cleancut cleareyed rivermen but strong in their experience and
their discipline To be sure they might not last quite as long as their
antagonists coulda whisky training is not conducive to long windbut
they always lasted plenty long enough Sandbags and brass knuckles
helped some ruthless singleness of purpose counted and team work
finished the job At times the storm rose high but up to now McNeill
had always ridden it

Orde and his men entered the lower hall as though sauntering in without
definite aim Perhaps a score of men were in the room Two tables of
cards were under waywith a great deal of noisy cardslapping that
proclaimed the game merely friendly Eight or ten other men wandered
about idly chaffing loudly with the girls pausing to overlook the card
games glancing with purposeless curiosity at the professional gamblers
sitting quietly behind their various layouts It was a dull evening

Orde wandered about with the rest a wide goodnatured smile on his
face

Start your little ball to rolling for that he instructed the roulette
man tossing down a bill Dropped again he lamented humorously
Cant seem to have any luck

He drifted on to the crap game

Throw us the little bones pardner he said Ill go you a five on
it

He lost here and so found himself at the table presided over by the
threecard monte men The rest of his party who had according to
instructions scattered about the place now began quietly to gravitate
in his direction

What kind of a layout is this inquired Orde

The dealer held up the three cards face out

What kind of an eye have you got bub he asked

Oh I dont know A pretty fair eye Why

Do you think you could pick out the jack when I throw them out like
this asked the dealer

Sure Shes that one

Well exclaimed the gambler with a pretence of disgust damn if you
didnt I bet you five dollars you cant do it again

Take you replied Orde Put up your five

Again Orde was permitted to pick the jack

Youve got the best eye thats been in this place since I got here
claimed the dealer admiringly Here Dennis said he to his partner
try if you can fool this fellow

Dennis obligingly took the cards threw them and lost By this time
the men augmented by the idlers not busy with the card games had drawn
close

Sail into em bub encouraged one

Whether it was that the gamblers expert in the reading of a mans mood
and intentions sensed the fact that Orde might be led to plunge or
whether more simply they were using him as a capper to draw the crowd
into their game it would be difficult to say but twice more they
bungled the throw and permitted him to win

Newmark plucked him at the sleeve

Youre twenty dollars ahead he muttered Quit it I never saw
anybody beat this game that much before

Orde merely shrugged him off with an appearance of growing excitement
while an HABITUE of the place probably one of the hired fighters
growled into Newmarks ear

Shut up you damn dude warned this man Keep out of what aint none
of your business

What limit do you put on this game anyway Orde leaned forward his
eyes alight

The two gamblers spoke swiftly apart

How much do you want to bet asked one

Would you stand for five hundred dollars asked Orde

A dead silence fell on the group Plainly could be heard the mens
quickened breathing The shouts and noise from the card parties
blundered through the stillness Some one tiptoed across and whispered
in the ear of the nearest player A moment later the chairs at the two
tables scraped back One of them fell violently to the floor Their
occupants joined the tense group about the monte game All the girls
drew near Only behind the bar the whiteaproned bartenders wiped their
glasses with apparent imperturbability their eyes however on their
brass knuckles hanging just beneath the counter their ears pricked up
for the riot call

The gambler pretended to deliberate his cool shifty eyes running over
the group before him A small door immediately behind him swung slowly
ajar an inch or so

Got the money he asked

Have you countered Orde

Apparently satisfied the man nodded

Ill go you bub if I lose said he Lay out your money

Orde counted out nine fiftydollar bills and five tens Probably no one
in the group of men standing about had realised quite how much money
five hundred dollars meant until they saw it thus tallied out before
them

All right said the gambler taking up the cards

Hold on cried Orde Wheres yours

Oh thats all right the gambler reassured him Im with the house
I guess McNeills credit is good he laughed

That may all be insisted Orde but Im putting up my good money and
I expect to see good money put up in return

They wrangled over this point for some time but Orde was obstinate
Finally the gamblers yielded A canvass of the drawer helped out by the
bar and the other games made up the sum It bulked large on the table
beside Ordes higher denominations

The interested audience now consisted of the dozen men comprised by
Ordes friends nearly twice as many strangers evidently rivermen
eight hangerson of the joint probably fighters and bouncers half a
dozen professional gamblers and several waitresses The four barkeepers
still held their positions Of these the rivermen were scattered
loosely back of Orde although Ordes own friends had by now gathered
compactly enough at his shoulder The mercenaries and gamblers had
divided and flanked the table at either side Newmark a growing wonder
and disgust creeping into his usually unexpressive face recognised
the strategic advantage of this arrangement In case of difficulty
a determined push would separate the rivermen from the gamblers long
enough for the latter to disappear quietly through the small door at the
back

Satisfied inquired the gambler briefly

Let her flicker replied Orde with equal brevity

A gasp of anticipation went up Quite coolly the gambler made his
passes With equal coolness and not the slightest hesitation Orde
planted his great red fist on one of the cards

That is the jack he announced looking the gambler in the eye

Oh is it sneered the dealer Well turn it over and lets see

No roared Orde YOU TURN OVER THE OTHER TWO

A low oath broke from the gambler and his face contorted in a spasm
The barkeepers slid out from behind the bar For a moment the situation
was tense and threatening The dealer with a sweeping glance again
searched the faces of those before him In that moment probably he
made up his mind that an open scandal must be avoided Force and broken
bones even murder might be all right enough under colour of right If
Orde had turned up for a jack the card on which he now held his fist
and then had attempted to prove cheating a cry of robbery and a lively
fight would have given opportunity for making way with the stakes
But McNeills could not afford to be shown up before thirty interested
rivermen as running an openandshut bracegame However the gambler
made a desperate try at what he must have known was a very forlorn hope

That isnt the way this game is played said he Show up your jack

Its the way I play it replied Orde sternly These gentlemen heard
the bet He reached over and dexterously flipped over the other two
cards You see neither of these is the jack this must be

You win assented the gambler after a pause

Orde his fist still on the third card began pocketing the stakes with
the other hand The gambler reached palm up across the table

Give me the other card said he

Orde picked it up laughing For a moment he seemed to hesitate holding
the bit of pasteboard tantalisingly outstretched as though he were
going to turn also this one face up Then quite deliberately he looked
to right and to left where the fighters awaited their signal laughed
again and handed the card to the gambler

At once pandemonium broke loose The rivermen of Ordes party fairly
shouted with joy over the unexpected trick the employees of the resort
whispered apart the gambler explained lowvoiced and angry his
reasons for not putting up a fight for so rich a stake

All to the bar yelled Orde

They made a rush and lined up and ordered their drinks Orde poured his
on the floor and took the glass belonging to the man next him

Get them to give you another Tim said he No knockout drops if I
can help it

The men drank and some one ordered another round

Tim said Orde lowvoiced get the crowd together and well pull
out Ive a thousand dollars on me and theyll sandbag me sure if I go
alone And lets get out right off

Ten minutes later they all stood safely on the lighted thoroughfare of
Water Street

Goodnight boys said Orde Go easy and show up at the booms
Monday

He turned up the street toward the main part of the town Newmark joined
him

Ill walk a little ways with you he explained And I say Orde I
want to apologise to you Most of the evening Ive been thinking you
the worst fool I ever saw but you can take care of yourself at every
stage of the game The trick was good but your taking the other
fellows drink beat it




VIII


Orde heard no more of Newmarkand hardly thought of himuntil over two
weeks later

In the meantime the riverman assuming the more conventional garments
of civilisation lived with his parents in the old Orde homestead at the
edge of town This was a rather pretentious twostory brick structure
in the old solid square architecture surrounded by a small orchard
some hickories and a garden Ordes father had built it when he arrived
in the pioneer country from New England forty years before At that time
it was considered well out in the country Since then the town had
crept to it so that the row of grand old maples in front shaded a
stoneguttered street A little patch of corn opposite and many still
vacant lots above placed it however as about the present limit of
growth

Jack Orde was the youngest and most energetic of a large family that had
long since scattered to diverse cities and industries He and Grandpa
and Grandma Orde dwelt now in the big echoing oldfashioned house
alone save for the one girl who called herself the help rather than
the servant Grandpa Orde now above sixty was tall straight slender
His hair was quite white and worn a little long His features were
finely chiselled and aquiline From them looked a pair of piercing
young black eyes In his time Grandpa Orde had been a mighty breaker
of the wilderness but his time had passed and with the advent of a
more intensive civilisation he had fallen upon somewhat straitened ways
Grandma Orde on the other hand was a very small spry old lady with
a small face a small figure small hands and feet She dressed in the
then usual cap and black silk of old ladies Half her time she spent at
her housekeeping which she loved jingling about from cellar to attic
storeroom seeing that Amanda the help had everything in order
The other half she sat in a wooden Dutch rockingchair by a window
overlooking the garden Her silkshod feet rested neatly side by side
on a carpetcovered hassock her back against a gay tapestried cushion
Near her purred big Jim a maltese rumoured to weigh fifteen pounds
Above her twittered a canary

And the interior of the house itself was in keeping The low ceilings
the slight irregularities of structure peculiar to the rather
ruleofthumb methods of the earlier builders the deep window
embrasures due to the thickness of the walls the unexpected passages
leading to unsuspected rooms and the fact that many of these apartments
were approached by a step or so up or a step or so downthese lent
to it a quaint oldfashioned atmosphere enhanced further by the steel
engravings the antique furnishings the manypaned windows and all
the belongings of old people who have passed from a previous generation
untouched by modern ideas

To this house and these people Orde came direct from the greatness of
the wilderness and the ferocity of Hells HalfMile Such contrasts were
possible even ten or fifteen years ago The untamed country lay at the
doors of the most modern civilisation

Newmark reappearing one Sunday afternoon at the end of the two weeks
was apparently bothered He examined the Orde place for some moments
walked on beyond it finding nothing there he returned and after some
hesitation turned in up the tar sidewalk and pulled at the oldfashioned
wire bellpull Grandma Orde herself answered the door

At sight of her fine features her dainty lace cap and mitts and the
stiffness of her rustling black silks Newmark took off his gray felt
hat

Goodafternoon said he Will you kindly tell me where Mr Orde
lives

This is Mr Ordes replied the little old lady

Pardon me persisted Newmark I am looking for Mr Jack Orde and I
was directed here I am sorry to have troubled you

Mr Jack Orde lives here returned Grandma Orde He is my son Would
you like to see him

If you please assented Newmark gravely his thin shrewd face masking
itself with its usual expression of quizzical cynicism

Step this way please and Ill call him requested his interlocutor
standing aside from the doorway

Newmark entered the cool dusky interior and was shown to the left into
a dim long room He perched on a mahogany chair and had time to notice
the bookcases with the white owl atop the old piano with the yellowing
keys the haircloth sofa and chairs the steel engravings and the two
oil portraits when Ordes large figure darkened the door

For an instant the young man who must just have come in from the
outside sunshine blinked into the dimness Newmark too blinked back
although he could by this time see perfectly well

Newmark had known Orde only as a riverman Like most Easterners then
and now he was unable to imagine a man in rough clothes as being
anything but essentially a rough man The figure he saw before him
was decently and correctly dressed in what was then the proper Sunday
costume His big figure set off the cloth to advantage and even his
windreddened face seemed toned down and refined by the change in
costume and surroundings

Oh its you Mr Newmark cried Orde in his hearty way and holding
out his hand Im glad to see you Where you been Come on out of
there This is the company place Without awaiting a reply he led
the way into the narrow hall whence the two entered another brighter
room in which Grandma Orde sat the canary singing above her head

Mother said Orde this is Mr Newmark who was with us on the drive
this spring

Grandma Orde laid her goldbowed glasses and her black leather Bible on
the stand beside her

Mr Newmark and I spoke at the door said she extending her frail
hand with dignity If you were on the drive Mr Newmark you must have
been one of the High Privates in this dreadful war we all read about

Newmark laughed and made some appropriate reply A few moments later
at Ordes suggestion the two passed out a side door and back into the
remains of the old orchard

Its pretty nice here under the trees said Orde Sit down and light
up Where you been for the last couple of weeks

I caught Johnsons drive and went on down river with him to the lake
replied Newmark thrusting the offered cigar in one corner of his mouth
and shaking his head at Ordes proffer of a light

You must like camp life

I do not like it at all negatived Newmark emphatically but the
drive interested me It interested me so much that Ive come back to
talk to you about it

Fire ahead acquiesced Orde

Im going to ask you a few questions about yourself and you can answer
them or not just as you please

Oh Im not bashful about my career laughed Orde

How old are you inquired Newmark abruptly

Thirty

How long have you been doing that sort of thingdriving I mean

Off and on about six years

Why did you go into that particular sort of thing

Orde selected a twig and carefully threw it at a lump in the turf

Because theres nothing ahead of shovelling but dirt he replied with
a quaint grin

I see said Newmark after a pause Then you think theres more
future to that sort of thing than the sort of thing the rest of your
friends go in forlaw and wholesale groceries and banking and the
rest of it

There is for me replied Orde simply

Yet youre merely riverdriving on a salary at thirty

Orde flushed slowly and shifted his position

Exactly soMr District Attorney he said drily

Newmark started from his absorption in his questioning and shifted his
unlighted cigar

Does sound like it he admitted but Im not asking all this out of
idle curiosity Ive got a scheme in my head that I think may work out
big for us both

Well assented Orde reservedly in that caseIm foreman on this
drive because my outfit went kerplunk two years ago and Im making a
fresh go at it

Failed inquired Newmark

Partner skedaddled replied Orde Now if youre satisfied with my
family history suppose you tell me what the devil youre driving at

He was plainly restive under the crossexamination to which he had been
subjected

Look here said Newmark abruptly changing the subject you know that
rapids up river flanked by shallows where the logs are always going
aground

I do replied Orde still grim

Well why wouldnt it help to put a string of piers down both sides
with booms between them to hold the logs in the deeper water

It would said Orde

Why isnt it done then

Who would do it countered Orde leaning back more easily in the
interest of this new discussion If Daly did it for instance then all
the rest of the drivers would get the advantage of it for nothing

Get them to pay their share

Orde grinned Id like to see you get any three men to agree to
anything on this river

And a sort of dam would help at that Spruce Rapids

Sure If you improved the river for driving shed be easier to drive
That goes without saying

How many firms drive logs on this stream

Ten replied Orde without hesitation

How many men do they employ

Driving asked Orde

Driving

About five hundred a few more or less

Now suppose Newmark leaned forward impressively suppose a firm
should be organised to drive ALL the logs on the river Suppose it
improved the river with necessary piers dams and all the rest of it
so that the driving would be easier Couldnt it drive with less than
five hundred men and couldnt it save money on the cost of driving

It might agreed Orde

You know the conditions here If such a firm should be organised
and should offer to drive the logs for these ten firms at so much a
thousand do you suppose it would get the business

It would depend on the driving firm said Orde You see mill men
have got to have their logs They cant afford to take chances It
wouldnt pay

Then thats all right agreed Newmark with a gleam of satisfaction
across his thin face Would you form a partnership with me having such
an object in view

Orde threw back his head and laughed with genuine amusement

I guess you dont realise the situation said he Wed have to have a
few little things like distributing booms and tugs and a lot of tools
and supplies and works of various kinds

Well wed get them

It was now Ordes turn to ask questions

How much are you worth he inquired bluntly

About twenty thousand dollars replied Newmark

Well if I raise very much more than twenty thousand cents Im lucky
just now

How much capital would we have to have asked Newmark

Orde thought for several minutes twisting the petal of an old
appleblossom between his strong blunt fingers

Somewhere near seventyfive thousand dollars he estimated at last

Thats easy cried Newmark Well make a stock companysay a hundred
thousand shares Well keep just enough between us to control the
companysay fiftyone thousand Ill put in my pile and you can pay
for yours out of the earnings of the company

That doesnt sound fair objected Orde

You pay interest explained Newmark Then well sell the rest of the
stock to raise the rest of the money

If we can interjected Orde

I think we can asserted Newmark

Orde fell into a brown study occasionally throwing a twig or a particle
of earth at the offending lump in the turf Overhead the migratory
warblers balanced rightside up or upside down searching busily among
the new leaves uttering their simple calls The air was warm and soft
and still the sky bright Fat hens clucked among the grasses A feel of
Sunday was in the air

I must have something to live on said he thoughtfully at last

So must I said Newmark Well have to pay ourselves salaries of
course but the smaller the better at first Youll have to take charge
of the men and the work and all the rest of itI dont know anything
about that Ill attend to the incorporating and the routine and Ill
try to place the stock Youll have to see first of all whether you
can get contracts from the logging firms to drive the logs

How can I tell what to charge them

Well have to figure that very closely You know where these different
drives would start from and how long each of them would take

Oh yes I know the river pretty well

Well then well figure how many days driving there is for each and
how many men there are and what it costs for wages grub toolswell
just have to figure as near as we can to the actual cost and then add a
margin for profit and for interest on our investment

It might work out all right admitted Orde

Im confident it would asserted Newmark And thered be no harm
figuring it all out would there

No agreed Orde that would be fun all right

At this moment Amanda appeared at the back door and waved an apron

Mr Jack she called Come in to dinner

Newmark looked puzzled and as he arose glanced surreptitiously at his
watch Orde seemed to take the summons as one to be expected however
In fact the strange hour was the usual Sunday custom in the Redding of
that day and had to do with the latechurch freedom of Amanda and her
like

Come in and eat with us invited Orde Wed be glad to have you

But Newmark declined

Come up tomorrow night then at halfpast six for supper Orde
urged him We can figure on these things a little Im in Dalys all
day and hardly have time except evenings

To this Newmark assented Orde walked with him down the deepshaded
driveway with the clipped privet hedge on one side to the iron gate
that swung open when one drove over a projecting lever There he said
goodbye

A moment later he entered the long diningroom where Grandpa and
Grandma Orde were already seated An oldfashioned service of smooth
silver and ivoryhandled steel knives gave distinction to the plain
white linen A teapot smothered in a cosey stood at Grandma Ordes
right A sirloin roast on a noble platter awaited Grandpa Ordes knife

Orde dropped into his place with satisfaction

Shut up Cheep he remarked to a frantic canary hanging in the
sunshine

Your friend seems a niceappearing young man said Grandma Orde
Wouldnt he stay to dinner

I asked him replied Orde but he couldnt He and I have a scheme
for making our everlasting fortunes

Who is he asked grandma

Orde dropped his napkin into his lap with a comical chuckle of dismay

Blest if I have the slightest idea mother he said Newmark joined
us on the drive Said he was a lawyer and was out in the woods for his
health Hes been with us studying and watching the work ever since




IX


I think Ill go see Jane Hubbard this evening Orde remarked to his
mother as he arose from the table This was his method of announcing
that he would not be home for supper

Jane Hubbard lived in a low onestory house of blue granite situated
amid a grove of oaks at the top of the hill She was a kindly girl
whose parents gave her free swing and whose house in consequence was
popular with the younger people Every Sunday she offered to all who
came a Sundaynight lunch which consisted of cold meats cold salad
bread butter cottage cheese jam preserves and the like warmed by
a cup of excellent tea These refreshments were served by the guests
themselves It did not much matter how few or how many came

On the Sunday evening in question Orde found about the usual crowd
gathered Jane herself tall deliberate in movement and in speech
kindly and thoughtful talked in a corner with Ernest Colburn who was
just out of college and who worked in a bank Mignonne Smith a plump
rather pretty little body with a tremendous aureole of hair like spun
golden fire was trying to balance a croquetball on the end of a ruler
The ball regularly fell off Three young men standing in attentive
attitudes thereupon dove forward in an attempt to catch it before
it should hit the floorwhich it generally did with a loud thump
A collapsed chair of slender lines stacked against the wall attested
previous acrobatics This much Orde standing in the doorway looked
upon quite as the usual thing Only he missed the Incubus Searching the
room with his eyes he at length discovered that incoherent desiccated
but persistent youth VISAVIS with a stranger Orde made out the white
of her gown in the shadows the willowy outline of her small and slender
figure and the gracious forward bend of her head

The company present caught sight of Orde standing in the doorway and
suspended occupations to shout at him joyfully He was evidently a
favourite The strange girl in the corner turned to him a white long
face of which he could see only the outline and the redness of the lips
where the lamplight reached them She leaned slightly forward and the
lips parted Ordes muscular figure standing square and uncompromising
in the doorway the outofdoor freshness of his complexion the
steadiness of his eyes laughing back a greeting had evidently attracted
her Or perhaps anything was a relief from the Incubus

So youre back at last are you Jack drawled Jane in her lazy
goodnatured way Come and meet Miss Bishop Carroll I want to present
Mr Orde

Orde bowed ceremoniously into the penumbra cast by the lamps broad
shade The girl inclined gracefully her small head with the glossy hair
The Incubus his thin hands clasped on his knee his sallow face twisted
in one of its customary wry smiles held to the edge of his chair with
characteristic pertinacity

Well Walter Orde addressed him genially are you having a good
time

Yesindeed replied the Incubus as though it were one word

His chair was planted squarely to exclude all others Orde surveyed the
situation with goodhumour

Going to keep the other fellow from getting a chance I see

Yesindeed replied the Incubus

Orde bent over and with great ease lifted Incubus chair and all and
set him facing Mignonne Smith and the croquetball

Here Mignonne said he Ive brought you another assistant

He returned to the lamp to find the girl her dark eyes alight with
amusement watching him intently She held the tip of a closed fan
against her lips which brought her head slightly forward in an attitude
as though she listened Somehow there was about her an air of poise
of absolute balanced repose quite different from Janes rather awkward
statics and in direct contrast to Mignonnes dynamics

Walter is a very bright man in his own line said Orde swinging
forward a chair but he mustnt be allowed any monopolies

How do you know I want him so summarily removed the girl asked him
without changing either her graceful attitude of suspended motion or the
intentness of her gaze

Well argued Orde I got him to say all he ever says to any
girlYesindeedso you couldnt have any more conversation from
him If you want to look at him why there he is in plain sight
Besides I want to talk to you myself

Do you always get what you want inquired the girl

Orde laughed

Any one can get anything he wants if only he wants it bad enough he
asserted

The girl pondered this for a moment and finally lowered and opened her
fan and threw back her head in a more relaxed attitude

Some people she amended However I forgive you I will even flatter
you by saying I am glad you came You look to have reached the age of
discretion I venture to say that these boys idea of a lively evening
is to throw bread about the table

Orde flushed a little The last time he had supped at Jane Hubbards
that was exactly what they did do

They are young of course he said and you and I are very old and
wise But having a noisy good time isnt such a great crimeor is it
where you came from

The girl leaned forward a sparkle of interest in her eyes

Are you and I going to fight she demanded

That depends on you returned Orde squarely but with perfect
goodhumour

They eyed each other a moment Then the girl closed her fan and leaned
forward to touch him on the arm with it

You are quite right not to allow me to say mean things about your
friends and I am a nasty little snip

Orde bowed with sudden gravity

And they do throw bread said he

They both laughed She leaned back with a movement of satisfaction
seeming to sink into the shadows

Now tell me what do you do

What do I do asked Orde puzzled

Yes Everybody does something out West here Its a disgrace not to do
something isnt it

Oh my business Im a riverdriver just now

A riverdriver she repeated once more leaning forward Why Ive
just been hearing a great deal about you

That so he inquired

Yes from Mrs Baggs

Oh said Orde Then you know what a drunken swearing worthless lot
of bums and toughs we are dont you

For the first time in some subtle way she broke the poise of her
attitude

There is Hells HalfMile she reminded him

Oh yes said Orde bitterly theres Hells HalfMile Whose fault
is that My rivermens My boys Look here I suppose you couldnt
understand it if you tried a month but suppose you were working out in
the woods nine months of the year up early in the morning and in late
at night Suppose you slept in rough blankets on the ground or in
bunks ate rough food never saw a woman or a book undertook work to
scare your city men up a tree and into a hole too easy risked your life
a dozen times a week in a tangle of logs with the big river roaring
behind just waiting to swallow you saw nothing but woods and river
were cold and hungry and wet and so tired you couldnt wiggle until
you got to feeling like the thing was never going to end and until you
got sick of it way through in spite of the excitement and danger And
then suppose you hit town where there were all the things you hadnt
hadand the first thing you struck was Hells HalfMile Say youve
seen water behind a jam havent you Waterpowers a good thing in a
mill course where it has wheels to turn but behind a jam it just RIPS
thingsoh whats the use talking A girl doesnt know what it means
She couldnt understand

He broke off with an impatient gesture She was looking at him intently
her lips again halfparted

I think I begin to understand a little said she softly She smiled to
herself But they are a hard and heartless class in spite of all their
energy and courage arent they she drew him out

Hard and heartless exploded Orde Theres no kinder lot of men on
earth let me tell you Why there isnt a man on that river who doesnt
chip in five or ten dollars when a man is hurt or killed and that means
three or four days hard work for him And he may not know or like the
injured man at all Why

Whats all the excitement drawled Jane Hubbard behind them Cant
you make it a tobecontinuedinournext Were most starved

Yesindeed chimed in the Incubus

The company trooped out to the diningroom where the table spread with
all the good things awaited them

Ernest you light the candles drawled Jane drifting slowly along the
table with her eye on the arrangements and some of you boys go get the
butter and the milkpitcher from the icebox

To Ordes relief no one threw any bread although the wholehearted
fun grew boisterous enough before the close of the meal Miss Bishop sat
directly across from him He had small chance of conversation with her
in the hubbub that raged but he gained full leisure to examine her
more closely in the fuller illumination Throughout her note was of
fineness Her hands as he had already noticed were long the fingers
tapering her wrists were finely moulded but slender and running
without abrupt swelling of muscles into the long lines of her forearm
her figure was rounded but built on the curves of slenderness her
piled glossy hair was so fine that though it was full of wonderful
soft shadows denied coarser tresses its mass hardly did justice to
its abundance Her face again was long and oval with a peculiar
transparence to the skin and a peculiar faint healthy circulation
of the blood well below the surface which relieved her complexion of
pallor but did not give her a colour The lips on the contrary were
satin red and Orde was mildly surprised after his recent talk to find
them sensitively moulded and with a quaint childlike quirk at the
corners Her eyes were rather contemplative and so black as to resemble
spots

In spite of her halfscornful references to breadthrowing she joined
with evident pleasure in the badinage and more practical fun which
struck the note of the supper Only Orde thought to discern even in her
more boisterous movements a graceful courteous restraint to catch in
the bend of her head a dainty concession to the joy of the moment
to hear in the tones of her laughter a reservation of herself which
nevertheless was not at all a reservation against the others

After the meal was finished each had his candle to blow out and then
all returned to the parlour leaving the debris for the later attention
of the hired help

Orde with determination made his way to Miss Bishops side She smiled
at him

You see I am a hypocrite as well as a mean little snip said she I
threw a little bread myself

Threw bread repeated Orde I didnt see you

The moon is made of green cheese she mocked him and there are
countries where mens heads do grow beneath their shoulders She moved
gracefully away toward Jane Hubbard Do you Western business men
never deal in figures of speech as well as figures of the other sort
she wafted back to him over her shoulder

I was very stupid acknowledged Orde following her

She stopped and faced him in the middle of the room smiling
quizzically

Well she challenged

Well what asked Orde puzzled

I thought perhaps you wanted to ask me something

Why

Your following me she explained the corners of her mouth smiling I
had turned away

I just wanted to talk to you said Orde

And you always get what you want she repeated Well she conceded
with a shrug of mock resignation But the four other men here cut in
with a demand

Music they clamoured We want music

With a nod Miss Bishop turned to the piano sweeping aside her white
draperies as she sat She struck a few soft chords and then her long
hands wandering idly and softly up and down the keys she smiled at them
over her shoulder

What shall it be she inquired

Some one thrust an open songbook on the rack in front of her The
others gathered close about leaning forward to see

Song followed song at first quickly then at longer intervals At last
the members of the chorus dropped away one by one to occupations of
their own The girl still sat at the piano her head thrown back idly
her hands wandering softly in and out of melodies and modulations
Watching her Orde finally saw only the shimmer of her white figure and
the white outline of her head and throat All the rest of the room was
gray from the concentration of his gaze At last her hands fell in her
lap She sat looking straight ahead of her

Orde at once arose and came to her

That was a wonderfully quaint and beautiful thing said he What was
it

She turned to him and he saw that the mocking had gone from her eyes
and mouth leaving them quite simple like a childs

Did you like it she asked

Yes said Orde He hesitated and stammered awkwardly It was so still
and soothing it made me think of the river sometimes about dusk What
was it

It wasnt anything I was improvising

You made it up yourself

It was myself I suppose I love to build myself a garden and
wander on until I lose myself in it Im glad there was a river in the
gardena nice still twilight river

She flashed up at him her head sidewise

There isnt always She struck a crashing discord on the piano

Every one looked up at the sudden noise of it

Oh dont stop they cried in chorus as though each had been
listening intently

The girl laughed up at Orde in amusement Somehow this flash of an
especial understanding between them to the exclusion of the others sent
a warm glow to his heart

I do wish you had your harp here said Jane Hubbard coming indolently
forward You just ought to hear her play the harp she told the rest
Its just the best thing you ever DID hear

At this moment the outside door opened to admit Mr and Mrs Hubbard who
had according to their usual Sunday custom been spending the evening
with a neighbour This was the signal for departure The company began
to break up

Orde pushed his broad shoulders in to screen Carroll Bishop from the
others

Are you staying here he asked

She opened her eyes wide at his brusqueness

Im visiting Jane she replied at length with an affectation of
demureness

Are you going to be here long was Ordes next question

About a month

I am coming to see you announced Orde Goodnight

He took her hand dropped it and followed the others into the hall
leaving her standing by the lamp She watched him until the outer
door had closed behind him Not once did he look back Jane Hubbard
returning after a moment from the hall found her at the piano again
her head slightly one side playing with painful and accurate exactness
a simple onefinger melody

Orde walked home down the hill in company with the Incubus Neither had
anything to say Orde because he was absorbed in thought the Incubus
because nothing occurred to draw from him his one remark Their feet
clipped sharply against the tar walks or rang more hollow on the
boards Overhead the stars twinkled through the stillbare branches of
the trees With few exceptions the houses were dark People retired
early in Redding An occasional hall light burned dimly awaiting some
ones return At the gate of the Orde place Orde roused himself to say
goodnight He let himself into the dimlighted hall hung up his
hat and turned out the gas For some time he stood in the dark
quite motionless then with the accuracy of long habitude he walked
confidently to the narrow stairs and ascended them Subconsciously he
avoided the creaking step but outside his mothers door he stopped
arrested by a greeting from within

That you Jack queried Grandma Orde

For answer Orde pushed open the door which stood an inch or so ajar
and entered A dim light from a distant streetlamp filtered through
the branches of a tree flickered against the ceiling By its aid
he made out the great square bed and divined the tiny figure of his
mother He seated himself sidewise on the edge of the bed

Go to Janes queried grandma in a low voice to avoid awakening
grandpa who slept in the adjoining room

Yes replied Orde in the same tone

Who was there

Oh about the usual crowd

He fell into an abstracted silence which endured for several minutes

Mother said he abruptly at last Ive met the girl I want for my
wife

Grandma Orde sat up in bed

Who is she she demanded

Her name is Carroll Bishop said Orde and shes visiting Jane
Hubbard

Yes but WHO is she insisted Grandma Orde Where is she from

Orde stared at her in the dim light

Why mother he repeated for the second time that day blest if I
know that




X


Orde was up and out at six oclock the following morning By eight he
had reported for work at Dalys mill where with the assistance of a
portion of the river crew he was occupied in sorting the logs in the
booms Not until six oclock in the evening did the whistle blow for the
shutdown Then he hastened home to find that Newmark had preceded him
by some few moments and was engaged in conversation with Grandma Orde
The young man was talking easily though rather precisely and with
brevity He nodded to Orde and finished his remark

After supper Orde led the way up two flights of narrow stairs to his
own room This was among the gables a chamber of strangely diversified
ceiling which slanted here and there according to the demands of the
roof outside

Well said he Ive made up my mind today to go in with you It may
not work out but its a good chance and I want to get in something
that looks like money I dont know who you are nor how much of a
business man you are or what your experience is but Ill risk it

Im putting in twenty thousand dollars pointed out Newmark

And Im putting in my everlasting reputation said Orde If we tell
these fellows that well get out their logs for them and then dont do
it Ill be DEAD around here

So thats about a standoff said Newmark Im betting twenty
thousand on what Ive seen and heard of you and youre risking your
reputation that I dont want to drop my money

Orde laughed

And I reckon were both right he responded

Still Newmark pursued the subject Ive no objection to telling you
about myself New York born and bred experience with Cooper and Dunne
brokers eight years Money from a legacy Parents dead No relatives to
speak to

Orde nodded gravely twice in acknowledgment

Now said Newmark have you had time to do any figuring

Well replied Orde I got at it a little yesterday afternoon and
a little this noon I have a rough idea He produced a bundle of
scribbled papers from his coatpocket Here you are I take Daly as
a sample because Ive been with his outfit It costs him to run and
deliver his logs one hundred miles about two dollars a thousand feet
Hes the only big manufacturer up here the rest are all at Monrovia
where they can get shipping by water I suppose it costs the other
nine firms doing business on the river from two to two and a half a
thousand

Newmark produced a notebook and began to jot down figures

Do these men all conduct separate drives he inquired

All but Proctor and old Heinzman They pool in together

Now went on Newmark if we were to drive the whole river how could
we improve on that

Well I havent got it down very fine of course Orde told him but
in the first place we wouldnt need so many men I could run the river
on three hundred easy enough That saves wages and grub on two hundred
right there And of course a few improvements on the river would save
time which in our case would mean money We would not need so many
separate cook outfits and all that Of course that part of it wed have
to get right down and figure on and it will take time Then too if
we agreed to sort and deliver wed have to build sorting booms down at
Monrovia

Suppose we had all that What for example do you reckon you could
bring Dalys logs down for

Orde fell into deep thought from which he emerged occasionally to
scribble on the back of his memoranda

I suppose somewhere about a dollar he announced at last He looked
up a trifle startled Why he cried that looks like big money A
hundred per cent

Newmark watched him for a moment a quizzical smile wrinkling the
corners of his eyes

Hold your horses said he at last I dont know anything about this
business but I can see a few things In the first place close figuring
will probably add a few cents to that dollar And then of course all
our improvements will be absolutely valueless to anybody after weve
got through using them You said yesterday theyd probably stand us in
seventyfive thousand dollars Even at a dollar profit wed have to
drive seventyfive million before we got a cent back And of
course weve got to agree to drive for a little less than they could
themselves

Thats so agreed Orde his crest falling

However said Newmark briskly as he arose theres good money in it
as you say Now how soon can you leave Daly

By the middle of the week we ought to be through with this job

Thats good Then well go into this matter of expense thoroughly and
establish our schedule of rates to submit to the different firms

Newmark said a punctilious farewell to Mr and Mrs Orde

By the way said Orde to him at the gate where are you staying

At the Grand

I know most of the people hereall the young folks Id be glad to
take you around and get you acquainted

Thank you replied Newmark you are very kind But I dont go in much
for that sort of thing and I expect to be very busy now on this new
matter so I wont trouble you




XI


The new partners as soon as Orde had released himself from Daly gave
all their time to working out a schedule of tolls Orde drew on his
intimate knowledge of the river and its tributaries and the locations
of the different rollways to estimate as closely as possible the time
it would take to drive them He also hunted up Tom North and others
of the older men domiciled in the cheap boardinghouses of Hells
HalfMile talked with them and verified his own impressions Together
he and Newmark visited the supply houses got prices obtained lists
All the evenings they figured busily until at last Newmark expressed
himself as satisfied

Now Orde said he here is where you come in Its now your job to
go out and interview these men and get their contracts for driving their
next winters cut

But Orde drew back

Look here Joe he objected thats more in your line You can talk
business to them better than I can

Not a bit negatived Newmark They dont know me from Adam and they
do know you and all about you Weve got to carry this thing through at
first on our face and theyd be more apt to entrust the matter to you
personally

All right agreed Orde Ill start in on Daly

He did so the following morning Daly swung his bulk around in his
revolving officechair and listened attentively

Well Jack said he I think youre a good riverman and I believe
you can do it Id be only too glad to get rid of the nuisance of it
let alone get it done cheaper If youll draw up your contract and bring
it in here Ill sign it I suppose youll break out the rollways

No said Orde we hadnt thought of doing more than the driving
and distributing Youll have to deliver the logs in the river Maybe
another year after we get better organised well be able to break
rollwaysat a price per thousandbut until we get agoing well have
to rush her through

Orde repeated this to his associate

That was smooth enough sailing he exulted

Yes pondered Newmark removing his glasses and tapping his thumb with
their edge Yes he repeated that was smooth sailing What was that
about rollways

Oh I told him wed expect him to break out his own said Orde

Yes but what does that mean exactly

Why explained Orde with a slight stare of surprise when the
logs are cut and hauled during the winter they are banked on the
riverbanks and even in the riverchannel itself Then when the thaws
come in the spring these piles are broken down and set afloat in the
river

I see said Newmark Well but why shouldnt we undertake that part
of it I should think that would be more the job of the riverdrivers

It would hold back our drive too much to have to stop and break
rollways explained Orde

The next morning they took the early train for Monrovia where were
situated the big mills and the offices of the nine other lumber
companies Within an hour they had descended at the small frame terminal
station and were walking together up the village street

Monrovia was at that time a very spreadout little place of perhaps two
thousand population It was situated a half mile from Lake Michigan
behind the sparsely wooded sand hills of its shore From the river
which had here grown to a great depth and width its main street ran
directly at right angles Four brick blocks of three stories lent
impressiveness to the vista The stores in general however were low
frame structures All faced broad plank sidewalks raised above the
street to the level of a waggon body From this main street ran off
to right and left other streets rendered lovely by maple trees that
fairly met across the way In summer over sidewalk and roadway alike
rested a dense refreshing dark shadow that seemed to throw from itself
an odour of coolness This was rendered further attractive by the
warm spicy odour of damp pine that arose from the resilient surface of
sawdust and shingles broken beneath the wheels of traffic Back
from these trees in wide wellcultivated lawns stood the better
residences They were almost invariably built of many corners with
steep roofs meeting each other at all angles with wide and ornamented
red chimneys numerous windows and much scroll work adorning each apex
and cornice The ridge poles bristled in fancy foothigh palisades of
wood Chimneys were provided with lightningrods Occasionally an
older structure on square lines recorded the era of a more dignified
architecture Everywhere ran broad sidewalks and picket fences Beyond
the better residence districts were the board shanties of the mill
workers

Orde and Newmark tramped up the plank walk to the farthest brick
building When they came to a cross street they had to descend to it
by a short flight of steps on one side and ascend from it by a
corresponding flight on the other At the hotel Newmark seated himself
in a rockingchair next the big window

Good luck said he

Orde mounted a wide dark flight of stairs that led from the street to a
darker hall The smell of stale cigars and cocoa matting was in the
air Down the dim length of this hall he made his way to a door which
without ceremony he pushed open

He found himself in a railedoff space separated from the main part of
the room by a high walnut grill

Mr Heinzman in he asked of a clerk

I think so replied the clerk to whom evidently Orde was known

Orde spent the rest of the morning with Heinzman a very rotund
cautious person of German extraction and accent Heinzman occupied
the time in asking questions of all sorts about the new enterprise At
twelve he had not in any way committed himself nor expressed an opinion
He however instructed Orde to return the afternoon of the following
day

I vill see Proctor said he

Orde rather exhausted returned to find Newmark still sitting in the
rockingchair with his unlighted cigar The two had lunch together
after which Orde somewhat refreshed started out He succeeded in
getting two more promises of contracts and two more deferred interviews

Thats going a little faster he told Newmark cheerfully

The following morning also he was much encouraged by the reception
his plan gained from the other lumbermen At lunch he recapitulated to
Newmark

Thats four contracts already said he and three more practically
a sure thing Proctor and Heinzman are slower than molasses about
everything and mean as pusley and Johnsons up in the air the way he
always is for fear some ones going to do him

It isnt a bad outlook admitted Newmark

But Heinzman offered a new problem for Ordes consideration

I haf talked with Proctor said he and ve like your scheme If you
can deliffer our logs here for two dollars and a quarter why that is
better as ve can do it but how do ve know you vill do it

Ill guarantee to get them here all right laughed Orde

But what is your guarantee good for persisted Heinzman blandly
locking his fingers over his rotund little stomach Suppose the logs
are not delifferedwhat then How responsible are you financially

Well were investing seventyfive thousand dollars or so

Heinzman rubbed his thumb and forefinger together and wafted the
imaginary pulverisation away

Worth that for a judgment said he

He allowed a pause to ensue

If you vill give a bond for the performance of your contract pursued
Heinzman that vould be satisfactory

Ordes mind was struck chaotic by the reasonableness of this request
and the utter impossibility of acceding to it

How much of a bond he asked

Twentyfife thousand vould satisfy us said Heinzman Bring us a
suitable bond for that amount and ve vill sign your contract

Orde ran down the stairs to find Newmark Heinzman wont sign unless we
give him a bond for performance he said in a low tone as he dropped
into the chair next to Newmark

Newmark removed his unlighted cigar looked at the chewed end and
returned it to the corner of his mouth

Heinzman has sense said he drily I was wondering if ordinary
business caution was unknown out here

Can we get such a bond Nobody would go on my bond for that amount

Mine either said Newmark Well just have to let them go and drive
ahead without them I only hope they wont spread the idea Better get
those other contracts signed up as soon as we can

With this object in view Orde started out early the next morning
carrying with him the duplicate contracts on which Newmark had been
busy

Rope em in advised Newmark Its Saturday and we dont want to let
things simmer over Sunday if we can help it

About eleven oclock a clerk of the Welton Lumber Co entered Mr
Weltons private office to deliver to Orde a note

This just came by special messenger he explained

Orde with an apology tore it open It was from Heinzman and requested
an immediate interview Orde delayed only long enough to get Mr
Weltons signature then hastened as fast as his horse could take him
across the drawbridge to the village

Heinzman he found awaiting him The little German with his round rosy
cheeks his dot of a nose his big spectacles and his rotund body
looked even more than usual like a spider or a Santa ClauseOrde could
not decide which

I haf been thinking of that bond he began waving a pudgy hand toward
a seat and I haf been talking with Proctor

Yes said Orde hopefully

I suppose you would not be prepared to gif a bond

I hardly think so

Vell suppose ve fix him this way went on Heinzman clasping his
hands over his stomach and beaming through his spectacles Proctor and
I haf talked it ofer and ve are agreet that the probosition is a good
one Also ve think it is vell to help the young fellers along He
laughed silently in such a manner as to shake himself all over Ve do
not vish to be too severe and yet ve must be assured that ve get our
logs on time Now I unterstood you to say that this new concern is a
stock company

Orde did not remember having said so but he nodded

Vell if you gif us a bond secured with stock in the new company that
would be satisfactory to us

Ordes face cleared

Do you mean that Mr Heinzman

Sure Ve must haf some security but ve do not vish to be too hard on
you boys

Now I call that a mighty good way out cried Orde

Make your contract out according to these terms then said Heinzman
handing him a paper and bring it in Monday

Orde glanced over the slip It recited two and a quarter as the agreed
price specified the date of delivery at Heinzman and Proctors booms
named twentyfive thousand dollars as the amount of the bond to be
secured by fifty thousand dollars worth of stock in the new company
This looked satisfactory Orde arose

Im much obliged to you Mr Heinzman said he Ill bring it around
Monday

He had reached the gate to the grill before Heinzman called him back

By the vay the little German beamed up at him swinging his fat legs
as the officechair tipped back on its springs if it is to be a stock
company you vill be selling some of the stock to raise money is it not
so

Yes agreed Orde I expect so

How much vill you capitalise for

We expect a hundred thousand ought to do the trick replied Orde

Vell said Heinzman ven you put it on the market come and see me
He nodded paternally at Orde beaming through his thick spectacles

That evening well after six Orde returned to the hotel After
freshening up in the marbled and boarded washroom he hunted up Newmark

Well Joe said he Im as hungry as a bear Come on eat and Ill
tell you all about it

They deposited their hats on the racks and pushed open the swinging
screen doors that led into the diningroom There they were taken
in charge by a marvellously haughty and redundant headwaitress who
signalled them to follow down through ranks of small tables watched
by more stately damsels Newmark reserved and precise irreproachably
correct in his neat gray seemed enveloped in an aloofness as
impenetrable as that of the headwaitress herself Orde however was as
breezy as ever He hastened his stride to overtake the headwaitress

Annie be good he said in his jolly way Weve got business to talk
Put us somewhere alone

Newmark nodded approval and thrust his hand in his pocket But Annie
looked up into Ordes frank laughing face and her lips curved ever so
faintly in the condescension of a smile

Sure sorr said she in a most unexpected brogue

Well Ive got em all said Orde as soon as the waitress had gone
with the order But the best stroke of business youd never guess I
roped in Heinzman

Good approved Newmark briefly

It was really pretty decent of the little Dutchman He agreed to let us
put up our stock as security Of course that security is good only if
we win out and if we win out why then hell get his logs so he wont
have any use for security So its just one way of beating the devil
around the bush He evidently wanted to give us the business but
he hated like the devil to pass up his rulesyou know how those old
shellbacks are

Hm yes said Newmark

The waitress sailed in through a violently kicked swinging door bearing
aloft a tin tray heaped perilously She slanted around a corner in
graceful opposition to the centrifugal brought the tray to port on a
sort of landing stage by a pillar and began energetically to distribute
small ironware dishes each containing a dab of something When the
clash of arrival had died Orde went on

I got into your department a little too

Hows that asked Newmark spearing a baked potato Heinzman said
hed buy some of our stock He seems to think we have a pretty good
show

Newmark paused his potato halfway to his plate

Kind of him said he after a moment Did he sign a contract

It wasnt made out Orde reminded him Ive the memoranda here Well
make it out tonight I am to bring it in Monday

I see were hung up here over Sunday observed Newmark No Sunday
trains to Redding

Orde became grave

I know it I tried to hurry matters to catch the six oclock but
couldnt make it His round jolly face fell sombre as though a light
within had been extinguished After a moment the light returned Cant
be helped said he philosophically

They ate hungrily then drifted out into the office again where Orde
lit a cigar

Now lets see your memoranda said Newmark

He frowned over the three simple items for some time

Its got me he confessed at last

What inquired Orde

What Heinzman is up to

What do you mean asked Orde turning in his chair with an air of slow
surprise

It all looks queer to me Hes got something up his sleeve Why should
he take a bond with that security from us If we cant deliver the logs
our company fails that makes the stock worthless that makes the bond
worthlessjust when it is needed Of course its as plain as the nose
on your face that he thinks the proposition a good one and is trying to
get control

Oh no cried Orde astounded

Orde youre all right on the river said Newmark with a dry little
laugh but youre a babe in the woods at this game

But Heinzman is honest cried Orde Why he is a church member and
has a class in Sundayschool

Newmark selected a cigar from his case examined it from end to end
finally put it between his lips The corners of his mouth were twitching
quietly with amusement

Besides he is going to buy some stock added Orde after a moment

Heinzman has not the slightest intention of buying a dollars worth of
stock asserted Newmark

But why

Did he make that bluff finished Newmark Because he wanted to find
out how much stock would be issued You told him it would be a hundred
thousand dollars didnt you

Whyyes I believe I did said Orde pondering Newmark threw back
his head and laughed noiselessly

So now he knows that if we forfeit the bond hell have controlling
interest he pointed out

Orde smoked rapidly his brow troubled

But what I cant make out reflected Newmark is why hes so sure
well have to forfeit

I think hes just taking a long shot at it suggested Orde who seemed
finally to have decided against Newmarks opinion I believe youre
shying at mares nests

Not he He has some good reason for thinking we wont deliver the logs
Why does he insist on putting in a date for delivery None of the others
does

I dont know replied Orde Just to put some sort of a time limit on
the thing I suppose

You say you surely can get the drive through by then

Orde laughed

Sure Why it gives me two weeks leeway over the worst possible luck I
could have Youre too almighty suspicious Joe

Newmark shook his head

You let me figure this out said he

But bedtime found him without a solution He retired to his room under
fire of Ordes goodnatured raillery Orde himself shut his door the
smile still on his lips As he began removing his coat however the
smile died The week had been a busy one Hardly had he exchanged a
dozen words with his parents for he had even been forced to eat his
dinner and supper away from home This Sunday he had promised himself to
make his deferred but muchdesired call on Jane Hubbardand her guest
He turned out the gas with a shrug of resignation For the first
time his brain cleared of its turmoil of calculations of guesses of
estimates and of men He saw clearly the limited illumination cast
downward by the lamp beneath its wide shade the graceful white figure
against the shadow of the easy chair the oval face cut in half by the
lamplight to show plainly the red lips with the quaint upward quirks at
the corners and dimly the inscrutable eyes and the hair with the soft
shadows With a sigh he fell asleep

Some time in the night he was awakened by a persistent tapping on the
door In the woodsmans manner he was instantly broad awake He lit
the gas and opened the door to admit Newmark partially dressed over his
night gown

Orde said he briefly and without preliminary didnt you tell me the
other day that rollways were piled both on the banks and IN the river

Yes sometimes said Orde Why

Then they might obstruct the river

Certainly

I thought so cried Newmark with as near an approach to exultation as
he ever permitted himself Now just one other thing arent Heinzmans
rollways below most of the others

Yes I believe they are said Orde

And of course it was agreed as usual that Heinzman was to break out
his own rollways

I see said Orde slowly You think he intends to delay things enough
so we cant deliver on the date agreed on

I know it stated Newmark positively

But if he refuses to deliver the logs no court of law will

Law cried Newmark Refuse to deliver You dont know that kind He
wont refuse to deliver Therell just be a lot of inevitable delays
and his foreman will misunderstand and all that You ought to know more
about that than I do

Orde nodded his eye abstracted

Its a childlike scheme commented Newmark If Id had more
knowledge of the business Id have seen it sooner

Id never have seen it at all said Orde humbly You seem to be the
valuable member of this firm Joe

In my way said Newmark you in yours We ought to make a good team




XII


Sunday afternoon Orde leaving Newmark to devices of his own walked
slowly up the main street turned to the right down one of the shaded
side residence streets that ended finally in a beautiful glistening
sandhill Up this he toiled slowly starting at every step avalanches
and streams down the slope Shortly he found himself on the summit and
paused for a breath of air from the lake

He was just above the tops of the maples which seen from this angle
stretched away like a forest through which occasionally thrust roofs and
spires Some distance beyond a number of taller buildings and the red
of bricks were visible Beyond them still were other sandhills planted
raggedly with windtwisted and stunted trees But between the brick
buildings and these sandhills flowed the riverwide deep and
stillbordered by the steamboat landings on the town side and by
fishermens huts and netracks and small boats on the other Orde seated
himself on the smooth clean sand and removed his hat He saw these
things and in imagination the far upper stretches of the river with
the mills and yards and booms extending for miles and still above them
the marshes and the flats where the river widened below the Big Bend
That would be the location for the booms of the new companya cheap
property on which the partners had already secured a valuation And
below he dropped in imagination with the slackening current until
between two greater sandhills than the rest the river ran out through
the channel made by two long piers to the lakeblue restless
immeasurable To right and left stretched the long Michigan coast with
its low yellow hills topped with the green of twisted pines firs and
beeches with always its beach of sand deep and dry to the very edge of
its tideless sea strewn with sawlogs bark and the ancient remains of
ships

After he had cooled he arose and made his way back to a pleasant
hardwood forest of maple and beech Here the leaves were just bursting
from their buds Underfoot the early spring flowersthe hepaticas
the anemones the trilium the dogtooth violets the quaint early
brightgreen undergrowthswere just reaching their perfection
Migration was in full tide Birds little and big flashed into view and
out again busy in the mystery of their northward pilgrimage giving
the appearance of secret and silent furtiveness yet each uttering his
characteristic call from time to time as though for a signal to others
of the host The woods were swarming as city streets yet to Orde these
little creatures were as though invisible He stood in the middle of a
great multitude he felt himself under the observation of many bright
eyes he heard the murmuring and twittering that proclaimed a throng
he sensed an onward movement that flowed slowly but steadily toward the
pole nevertheless a flash of wings a fluttering little body the dip
of a hasty short flight represented the visible tokens Across the pale
silver sun of April their shadows flickered and with them flickered the
tracery of new leaves and the delicacy of the lacelike upper branches

Orde walked slowly farther and farther into the forest lost in an
enjoyment which he could not have defined accurately but which was so
integral a portion of his nature that it had drawn him from the banks
and wholesale groceries to the woods After a while he sat down on a
log and lit his pipe Ahead the ground sloped upward Dimly through the
halffronds of the early season he could make out the yellow of sands
and the deep complementary blue of the sky above them He knew the Lake
to lie just beyond With the thought he arose A few moments later he
stood on top the hill gazing out over the blue waters

Very blue they were with a contrasting snowy white fringe of waves
breaking gently as far up the coast as the eye could reach The beach
on these tideless waters was hard and smooth only in the narrow strip
over which ran the wash of the low surf All the rest of the expanse of
sand back to the clifflike hills lay dry and tumbled into hummocks and
drifts from which projected here a sawlog cast inland from a raft by
some longpast storm there a slab again a ships rib sticking gaunt
and defiant from the shifting restless medium that would smother it
And just beyond the edge of the hard sand following the long curves of
the wash lay a dark narrow line of bark fragments

The air was very clear and crystalline The lighthouses on the ends of
the twin piers though some miles distant seemed close at hand White
herring gulls cruising against the blue flashed white as the sails of
a distant ship A fresh breeze darkened the blue velvet surface of the
water tumbled the white foam hissing up the beach blew forward over
the dunes a fine hurrying mist of sand and bore to Orde at last the
refreshment of the wide spaces A woman walking slowly bent her head
against the force of this wind

Orde watched her idly She held to the better footing of the smooth
sand which made it necessary that she retreat often before the
inrushing wash sometimes rather hastily Orde caught himself admiring
the grace of her deft and sudden movements and the sway of her willowy
figure Every few moments she turned and faced the lake her head thrown
back the wind whipping her garments about her

As she drew nearer Orde tried in vain to catch sight of her face She
looked down watching the waters advance and recede she wore a brimmed
hat bent around her head by means of some sort of veil tied over the
top and beneath her chin When she had arrived nearly opposite Orde she
turned abruptly inland and a moment later began laboriously to climb
the steep sand

The process seemed to amuse her She turned her head sidewise to watch
with interest the hurrying tumbling little cascades that slid from her
every step From time to time she would raise her skirts daintily with
the tips of her fingers and lean far over in order to observe with
interest how her feet sank to the ankles and how the sand rushed from
either side to fill in the depressions The wind carried up to Orde low
joyous chuckles of delight like those of a happy child

As though directed by some unseen guide her course veered more and more
until it led directly to the spot where Orde stood When she was within
ten feet of him she at last raised her head so the young man could see
something besides the top of her hat Orde looked plump into her eyes

Hullo she said cheerfully and unsurprised and sank down crosslegged
at his feet

Orde stood quite motionless overcome by astonishment Her face its
long oval framed in the bands of the gray veil and the downturned brim
of the hat looked up smiling into his The fresh air had deepened the
colour beneath her skin and had blown loose stray locks of the fine
shadowfilled hair Her red lips with the quaintly upturned corners
smiled at him with a new frankness and the black eyesthe eyes so
black as to resemble spotshad lost their halfindolent reserve and
brimmed over quite frankly with the joy of life She scooped up a
handful of the dry clean sand from either side of her raised it aloft
and let it trickle slowly between her fingers The wind snatched at the
sand and sprayed it away in a beautiful plume

Isnt this REAL fun she asked him

Why Miss Bishop cried Orde finding his voice What are you doing
here

A faint shade of annoyance crossed her brow

Oh I could ask the same of you and then wed talk about how surprised
we are world without end said she The important thing is that here
is sand to play in and there is the Lake and here are we and the day
is charmed and its good to be alive Sit down and dig a hole Weve
all the common days to explain things in

Orde laughed and seated himself to face her Without further talk and
quite gravely they commenced to scoop out an excavation between
them piling the sand over themselves and on either side as was most
convenient As the hole grew deeper they had to lean over more and more
Their heads sometimes brushed ever so lightly their hands perforce
touched Always the dry sand flowed from the edges partially to fill in
the result their efforts Faster and faster they scooped it out again
The excavation thus took on the shape of a funnel Her cheeks glowed
pink her eyes shone like stars Entirely was she absorbed in the task
At last a tiny commotion manifested itself in the bottom of the funnel
Impulsively she laid her hand on Ordes to stop them Fascinated
they watched After incredible though lilliputian upheavals at
length appeared a tiny black insect struggling against the rolling
overwhelming sands With great care the girl scooped this newcomer
out and set him on the level ground She looked up happily at Orde
thrusting the loose hair from in front of her eyes

I was convinced we ought to dig a hole said she gravely Now lets
go somewhere else

She arose to her feet shaking the sand free from her skirts

I think through these woods she decided Can we get back to town
this way

Receiving Ordes assurance she turned at once down the slope through
the fringe of scrub spruces and junipers into the tall woods Here the
air fell still She remarked on how warm it seemed and began to untie
from over her ears the narrow band of veil that held close her hat

Yes replied Orde The lumberjacks say that the woods are the poor
mans overcoat

She paused to savour this her head on one side her arms upraised to
the knot

Oh I like that said she continuing her task In a moment or so the
veil hung free She removed it and the hat and swung them both from one
finger and threw back her head

Hear all the birds she said

Softly she began to utter a cheeping noise between her lips and teeth
low and plaintive At once the volume of birdsounds about increased
the halfseen flashes became more frequent A second later the twigs
were alive with tiny warblers and creepers flirting from branch to
branch with larger more circumspect chewinks catbirds and finches
hopping down from above very silent very grave In the depths of the
thickets the shyer hermit and olive thrushes and the oven birds revealed
themselves ghostlike or as seagrowths lift into a half visibility
through translucent shadows the colour of themselves All were very
intent very earnest very interested each after his own manner in the
comradeship of the featherhood he imagined to be uttering distressful
cries A few like the chickadees quivered their wings opened their
little mouths fluttered down tiny but aggressive against the disaster
Others hopped here and there restlessly uttering plaintive lowtoned
cheeps The shyest contented themselves by a discreet silent and
distant sympathy Three or four freebooting Jays attracted not so much
by the supposed calls for help as by curiosity fluttered among the tops
of the trees uttering their harsh notes

Finally the girl ended her performance in a musical laugh

Run away Brighteyes she called Its all right nobodys damaged

She waved her hand As though at a signal the host she had evoked
melted back into the shadows of the forest Only the chickadee impudent
as ever retreated scolding rather ostentatiously and the jays
splendid in their ornate blue screamed opinions at each other from the
tops of trees

How would you like to be a bird she inquired

Hadnt thought replied Orde

Dont you ever indulge in vain and idle speculations she inquired
Never mind dont answer Its too much to expect of a man

She set herself in idle motion down the slope swinging the hat at the
end of its veil pausing to look or listen humming a little melody
between her closed lips throwing her head back to breathe deep the warm
air revelling in the woods sounds and woods odours and woods life with
entire selfabandonment Orde followed her in silence She seemed to
be quite without responsibility in regard to him and yet an occasional
random remark thrown in his direction proved that he was not forgotten
Finally they emerged from the beach woods

They faced an open rolling country As far as the eye could reach were
the old stumps of pine trees Sometimes they stood in place burned and
scarred but attesting mutely the abiding place of a spirit long since
passed away Sometimes they had been uprooted and dragged to mark the
boundaries of fields where they raised an abatis of twisted roots to
the sky

The girl stopped short as she came face to face with this open country
The inner uplift that had lent to her aspect the wideeyed careless
joy of a child faded In its place came a new and serious gravity She
turned on him troubled eyes

You do this she accused him quite simply

For answer he motioned to the left where below them lay a wide and
cultivated countrysidefarmhouses surrounded by elms compact wood lots
of hardwood crops and orchards all fair and pleasant across the bosom
of a fertile nature

And this said he That valley was once nothing but a pine
forestand so was all the southern part of the State the peach belt
and the farms And for that matter Indiana too and all the other
forest States right out to the prairies Where would we be now if we
HADNT done that he pointed across at the stumpcovered hills

Mischief had driven out the gravity from the girls eyes She had
lowered her head slightly sidewise as though to conceal their expression
from him

I was beginning to be afraid youd say yesindeed said she

Orde looked bewildered then remembered the Incubus and laughed

I havent been very conversational he acknowledged

Certainly NOT she said severely That would have been very
disappointing There has been nothing to say She turned and waved her
hat at the beech woods falling sombre against the lowering sun

Goodbye she said gravely and pleasant dreams to you I hope those
very saucy little birds wont keep you awake She looked up at Orde
He was rather nice to us this afternoon she explained and its
always well to be polite to them anyway She gazed steadily at Orde for
signs of amusement He resolutely held his face sympathetic

Now I think well go home said she

They made their way between the stumps to the edge of the sandhill
overlooking the village With one accord they stopped The lowslanting
sun cast across the vista a sleepy light of evening

How would you like to live in a place like that all your life asked
Orde

I dont know She weighed her words carefully It would depend The
place isnt of so much importance it seems to me Its the life one is
called to Its whether one finds her souls realm or not that a place
is liveable or not I can imagine entering my kingdom at a railway
watertank she said quaintly or missing it entirely in a big city

Orde looked out over the raw little village with a new interest

Of course I can see how a mans work can lie in a small place said
he but a woman is different

Why is a woman different she challenged What is her work as you
call it and why shouldnt it as well as a mans lie in a small place
What is workoutside of drudgeryunless it is correspondence of ones
abilities to ones task

But the compensations began Orde vaguely

Compensations she cried What do you mean Here are the woods and
fields the river the lake the birds and the breezes Well check
them off against the theatre and balls Books can be had here as well
as anywhere As to people in a large city you meet a great many
and theyre all busy and unless you make an especial and particular
effortwhich youre not likely toyoull see them only casually and
once in a great while In a small place you know fewer people but you
know them intimately She broke off with a halflaugh Im from New
York she stated humorously and youve magicked me into an eloquent
defense of Podunk She laughed up at Orde quite frankly Giant
Strides she challenged suddenly She turned off the edge of the
sandhill and began to plunge down its slope leaning far back her
arms extended increasing as much as possible the length of each step
Orde followed at full speed When the bottom was reached he steadied
her to a halt She shook herself straightened her hat and wound the
veil around it Her whole aspect seemed to have changed with the descent
into the conventionality of the village street The old gentle though
capable and selfcontained reserve had returned She moved beside Orde
with dignity

I came down with Jane and Mrs Hubbard to see Mr Hubbard off on the
boat for Milwaukee last night she told him Of course we had to wait
over Sunday Mrs Hubbard and Jane had to see some relative or other
but I preferred to take a walk

Where are you staying asked Orde

At the Bennetts Do you know where it is

Yes replied Orde

They said little more until the Bennetts gate was reached Orde
declined to come in

Goodnight she said I want to thank you You did not once act as
though you thought I was silly or crazy And you didnt try as all the
rest of them would to act silly too You couldnt have done it and
you didnt try Oh you may have felt itI know She smiled one of her
quaint and quizzical smiles But men arent built for foolishness They
have to leave that to us Youve been very nice this afternoon and its
helped a lot Im good for quite a long stretch now Goodnight

She nodded to him and left him tonguetied by the gate

Orde however walked back to the hotel in a black rage with himself
over what he termed his imbecility As he remembered it he had made
just one consecutive speech that afternoon

Joe said he to Newmark at the hotel office whats the plural form
of Incubus I dimly remember it isnt busses

Incubi answered Newmark

Thanks said Orde gloomily




XIII


I have Heinzmans contract all drawn said Newmark the next morning
and I think Ill go around with you to the office

At the appointed time they found the little German awaiting them a
rotund smile of false goodnature illuminating his rosy face Orde
introduced his partner Newmark immediately took charge of the
interview

I have executed here the contract and the bonds secured by Mr Ordes
and my shares of stock in the new company he explained It is
only necessary that you affix your signature and summon the required
witnesses

Heinzman reached his hands for the papers beaming over his glasses at
the two young men

As he read however his smile vanished and he looked up sharply

Vat is this he inquired a new crispness in his voice You tolt me
he accused Orde dot you were not brepared to break out the rollways
You tolt me you would egspect me to do that for myself

Certainly agreed Orde

Vell why do you put in this demanded Heinzman reading from the
paper in his hand In case said rollways belonging to said parties
of the second part are not broken out by the time the drive has reached
them and in case on demand said parties of the second part do refuse
or do not exercise due diligence in breaking out said rollways the said
parties of the first part shall themselves break out said rollways and
the said parties of the second part do hereby agree to reimburse said
parties of the first part at the rate of a dollar per thousand board
feet

That is merely to protect ourselves struck in Newmark

But exploded Heinzman his face purpling a dollar a tousand is
absurd

Of course it is agreed Newmark We expect it to be But also we
expect you to break out your own rollways in time It is intended as a
penalty in case you dont

I vill not stand for such foolishness pounded Heinzman on the arm of
his chair

Very well said Newmark crisply reaching for the contract

But Heinzman clung to it

It is absurd he repeated in a milder tone See I vill strike it
out He did so with a few dashes of the pen

We have no intention stated Newmark with decision of giving you the
chance to hang up our drive

Heinzman caught his breath like a child about to cry out

So that is what you think he shouted at them Thats the sort of
men you think we are Ill show you you cannot come into honest mens
offices to insoolt them by such insinuations He tore the contract in
pieces and threw it in the waste basket Get oudt of here he cried

Newmark arose as dry and precise as ever Orde was going red and white
by turns and his hands twitched

Then I understand you to refuse our offer asked Newmark coolly

Refuse Yes You and your whole kapoodle yelled Heinzman

He hopped down and followed them to the grill door repeating over and
over that he had been insulted The clerks stared in amazement

Once at the foot of the dark stairs and in the open street Orde looked
up at the sky with a deep breath of relief

Whew said he that was a terror Weve gone off the wrong foot that
time

Newmark looked at him with some amusement

You dont mean to say that fooled you he marvelled

What asked Orde

All that talk about insults and the rest of the rubbish He saw we
had spotted his little scheme and he had to retreat somehow It was as
plain as the nose on your face

You think so doubted Orde

I know so If he was mad at all it was only at being found out

Maybe said Orde

Weve got an enemy on our hands in any case concluded Newmark and
one well have to look out for I dont know how hell do it but hell
try to make trouble on the river Perhaps hell try to block the stream
by not breaking his rollways

One of the first things well do will be to boom through a channel
where Mr Mans rollways will be said Orde

A faint gleam of approval lit Newmarks eyes

I guess youll be equal to the occasion said he drily

Before the afternoon train there remained four hours The partners at
once hunted out the little onestory frame building near the river in
which Johnson conducted his business

Johnson received them with an evident reserve of suspicion

I see no use in it said he passing his hand over his hair slicked
down in the lumberjack fashion I can run me own widout help from any
man

Which seems to settle that said Newmark to Orde after they had left

Oh well his drive is small and hes behind us Orde pointed out

True said Newmark thoughtfully

Now said Newmark as they trudged back to their hotel to get
lunch and their handbags Ill get to work at my part of it This
proposition of Heinzmans has given me an idea Im not going to try to
sell this stock outside but to the men who own timber along the river
Then they wont be objecting to the tolls for if the company makes any
profits part will go to them

Good idea cried Orde

Ill take these contracts to show we can do the business

All correct

And Ill see about incorporation Also Ill look about and get a proper
office and equipments and get hold of a bookkeeper Of course well
have to make this our headquarters

I suppose so said Orde a little blankly After an instant he laughed
Do you know I hadnt thought of that Well have to live here wont
we

Also went on Newmark calmly Ill buy the supplies to the best
advantage I can and see that they get here in good shape I have our
preliminary lists and as fast as you think you need anything send a
requisition in to me and Ill see to it

And I inquired Orde

Youll get right at the construction Get the booms built and improve
the river where it needs it Begin to get your crewIm not going to
tell you how you know better than I do Only get everything in shape
for next springs drive You can start right off We have my money to
begin on

Orde laughed and stretched his arms over his head

My Shes a nice big job isnt she he cried joyously




XIV


Orde in spite of his activities managed to see Carroll Bishop twice
during the ensuing week

On his return home late Monday afternoon Grandma Orde informed him
with a shrewd twinkle that she wanted him surely at home the following
evening

Ive asked in three or four of the young people for a candy pull said
she

Who mother asked Orde

Your crowd The Smiths Collinses Jane Hubbard and Her said Grandma
Orde which probably went to show that she had in the meantime been
making inquiries and was satisfied with them

Do you suppose theyll care for candy pulling hazarded Orde a little
doubtfully

You mean will she countered Grandma Well I hope for both your
sakes she is not beyond a little oldfashioned fun

So it proved The young people straggled in at an early hour after
supperevery one had supper in those days Carroll Bishop and Jane
arrived nearly the last Orde stepped into the hall to help them with
their wraps He was surprised as he approached Miss Bishop to lift her
cloak from her shoulders to find that the top of her daintily poised
head with its soft fine hair came well below the level of his eyes
Somehow her poise her slender grace of movement and of attitude had
lent her the impression of a stature she did not possess Tonight her
eyes while fathomless as ever shone quietly in anticipation

Do you know she told Orde delightedly I have never been to a real
candy pull in my life It was so good of your mother to ask me What a
dear she looks tonight And is that your father Im going to speak to
him

She turned through the narrow door into the lighted lowceilinged
parlour where the company were chatting busily Orde mechanically
followed her He was arrested by the sound of Jane Hubbards slow
goodhumoured voice behind him

Now Jack she drawled I agree with you perfectly but that is NO
reason why I should be neglected entirely Come and hang up my coat

Full of remorse Orde turned Jane Hubbard stood accusingly in the
middle of the hall her plain shrewd goodhumoured face smiling
faintly Orde met her frank wide eyes with some embarrassment

Here it is said Jane holding out the coat I dont much care
whether you hang it up or not I just wanted to call you back to wish
you luck Her slow smile widened and her gray eyes met his still more
knowingly

Orde seized the coat and her hand at the same time

Jane youre a trump said he No wonder youre the most popular girl
in town

Of course I am Jack she agreed indolently She entered the parlour

The candy pulling was a success Of course everybody got burned a
little and spattered a good deal but that was to be expected After
the product had been broken and been piled on dishes all trooped to the
informal back sittingroom where an open fire invited to stories and
games of the quieter sort Some of the girls sat in chairs though most
joined the men on the hearth

Carroll Bishop however seemed possessed of a spirit of restlessness
The place seemed to interest her She wandered here and there in the
room looking now at the walnutframed photograph of Uncle Jim Orde
now at the great pink conch shells either side the door now at the
marbletopped table with its square paperweight of polished agate and
its glass bell beneath which stood a very lifelike robin This back
sittingroom contained little in the way of ornament It was filled on
the contrary with old comfortable chairs and worn calfbacked books
The girl peered at the titles of these but the gasjets had been turned
low in favour of the firelight and she had to give over the effort
to identify the volumes Once she wandered close to Grandma Ordes
cushioned wooden rocker and passed her hand lightly over the old ladys
shoulder

Do you mind if I look at things she asked Its so dear and sweet
and old and different from our New York homes

Look all you want to dearie said Grandma Orde

After a moment she passed into the diningroom Here Orde found her her
hands linked in front of her

Oh it is so quaint and delightful she exhaled slowly This dear
dear old house with its low ceilings and its queer haphazard lines and
its deep windows and its old pictures and queer unexpected things that
take your breath away

It is one of the oldest houses in town said Orde and I suppose it
is picturesque But you see I was brought up here so Im used to it

Wait until you leave it said she prophetically and live away from
it Then all these things will come back to you to make your heart ache
for them

They rambled about together Ordes enthusiasm gradually kindling at the
flame of her own He showed her the marvellous and painstaking pencil
sketch of Napoleon looking out over a maltesecross sunset done by Aunt
Martha at the age of ten It hung framed in the upper hall

It has always been there ever since I can remember said Orde and
it has seemed to belong there Ive never thought of it as good or bad
just as belonging

I know she nodded

In this spirit also they viewed the plaster statue of Washington in the
lower hall and the Rogers group in the parlour The glass cabinet of
curiosities interested her greatlythe carved ivory chessmen the
dried seaweeds the stone from Sugar Loaf Rock the bit from the wreck
of the NORTH STAR the gold and silver shells the glittering geodes and
pyrites the sandalwood fan and all the hundred and one knickknacks
it was then the custom to collect under glass They even ventured
part way up the creaky attic stairs but it was too dark to enter that
mysterious region

I hear the drip of water she whispered her finger on her lips

Its the tank said Orde

And has it a Dark Place behind it she begged

Thats just what it has said he

Andtell meare there real hair trunks with brass knobs on em

Yes mother has two or three

Ooh she breathed softly Dont tell me whats in them I want to
believe in brocades and sashes Do you know she looked at him soberly
I never had any dark places behind the tank nor mysterious trunks
when I was a child

You might begin now suggested Orde

Do you mean to insinuate I havent grown up she mocked Thank you
Look OUT she cried suddenly the Boojum will catch us and picking
up her skirts she fairly flew down the narrow stairs Orde could hear
the light swish of her draperies down the hall and then the pat of her
feet on the stair carpet of the lower flight

He followed rather dreamily A glance into the sittingroom showed the
group gathered close around the fire listening to Lem Collins attempt
at a ghost story She was not there He found her then in the parlour
She was kneeling on the floor before the glass cabinet of curiosities
and she had quite flattened her little nose against the pane At his
exclamation she looked up with a laugh

This is the proper altitude from which to view a cabinet of
curiosities said she and something tells me you ought to flatten
your nose too She held out both hands to be helped up Oh WHAT a
house for a child she cried

After the company had gone Orde stood long by the front gate looking up
into the infinite spaces Somehow and vaguely he felt the night to be
akin to her elusive spirit Farther and farther his soul penetrated
into its depths and yet other depths lay beyond other mysteries other
unguessed realms And yet its beauty was the simplicity of space and
dark and the stars

The next time he saw her was at her own houseor rather the house of
the friend she visited Orde went to call on Friday evening and was
lucky enough to find the girls home and alone After a decent interval
Jane made an excuse and went out They talked on a great variety of
subjects and with a considerable approach toward intimacy Not until
nearly time to go did Orde stumble upon the vital point of the evening
He had said something about a plan for the week following

But you forget that by that time I shall be gone said she

Gone he echoed blankly Where

Home said she Dont you remember I am to go Sunday morning

I thought you were going to stay a month

I was but Icertain things came up that made it necessary for me to
leave sooner

IIm sorry youre going stammered Orde

So am I said she Ive had a very nice time here

Then I wont see you again said Orde still groping for realisation
I must go to Monrovia tomorrow But Ill be down to see you off

Do come said she

Its not to be for good he expostulated Youll be coming back

She threw her hands palm out with a pretty gesture of ignorance

That is in the lap of the gods said she

Will you write me occasionally he begged

As to that she beganIm a very poor correspondent

But wont you write he insisted

I do not make it a custom to write to young men

Oh he cried believing himself enlightened Will you answer if I
write you

That depends

On what

On whether there is a reply to make

But may I write you

I suppose I couldnt very well prevent you if you were sure to put on
a threecent stamp

Do you want me to persisted Orde

She began gently to laugh quite to herself as though enjoying a joke
entirely within her own personal privilege

You are so direct and persistent and boylike said she presently
Now if youll be very good and not whisper to the other little pupils
Ill tell you how they do such things usually She sat up straight from
the depths of her chair her white delicately tapering forearms resting
lightly on her knees Young men desiring to communicate with young
ladies do not ask them bluntly They make some excuse like sending
a book a magazine a marked newspaper or even a bit of desired
information At the same time they send notes informing the girl of the
fact The girl is naturally expected to acknowledge the politeness If
she wishes the correspondence to continue she asks a question or in
some other way leaves an opening Do you see

Yes I see said Orde slightly crestfallen But thats a long time
to wait I like to feel settled about a thing I wanted to know

She dropped back against the cushioned slant of her easy chair and
laughed again

And so you just up and asked she teased

I beg your pardon if I was rude he said humbly

The laughter died slowly from her eyes

Dont she said It would be asking pardon for being yourself You
wanted to know so you asked And Im going to answer I shall be very
glad to correspond with you and tell you about my sort of things if
you happen to be interested in them I warn you they are not very
exciting

They are yours said he

She half rose to bow in mock graciousness caught herself and sank
back

No I wont she said more than half to herself She sat brooding
for a moment then suddenly her mood changed She sprang up shook her
skirts free and seated herself at the piano To Orde who had also
arisen she made a quaint grimace over her shoulder

Admire your handiwork she told him You are rapidly bringing me
to tell the truth and shame the devil Oh he must be dying of
mortification this evening She struck a great crashing chord holding
the keys while the strings reverberated and echoed down slowly into
silence again It isnt fair she went on for you big simple men
to disarm us I dont care I have my private opinion of such brute
strength JE ME MOQUE

She wrinkled her nose and narrowed her eyes Then ruthlessly she drowned
his reply in a torrent of music Like mad she played rocking her
slender body back and forth along the keyboard holding rigid her
fingers her hands and the muscles of her arms The bass notes roared
like the rumbling of thunder the treble flashed like the dart of
lightnings Abruptly she muted the instrument Silence fell as something
that had been pent and suddenly released She arose from the piano stool
quite naturally both hands at her hair

Arent Mr and Mrs Hubbard dear old people said she

What is your address in New York demanded Orde She sank into a chair
nearby with a pretty uplifted gesture of despair

I surrender she cried and then she laughed until the tears started
from her eyes and she had to brush them away with what seemed to Orde an
absurd affair to call a handkerchief Oh you are delicious she said
at last Well listen I live at 12 West Ninth Street Can you remember
that Orde nodded And now any other questions the prisoner can reply
to without incriminating herself she is willing to answer She folded
her hands demurely in her lap

Two days later Orde saw the train carry her away He watched the rear
car disappear between the downward slopes of two hills and then finally
the last smoke from the locomotive dissipate in the clear blue

Declining Janes kindly meant offer of a lift he walked back to town




XV


The new firm plunged busily into its more pressing activities Orde
especially had an infinitude of details on his hands The fat notebook
in his side pocket filled rapidly with rough sketches lists and
estimates Constantly he interviewed men of all kindsrivermen mill
men contractors boat builders hardware dealers piledriver captains
builders wholesale grocery men cooks axemen chore boysall a
little world in itself

The signs of progress soon manifested themselves Below Big Bend the
piledrivers were at work the square masses of their hammers rising
rapidly to the tops of the derricks there to pause a moment before
dropping swiftly to a dull THUMP They were placing a long compact row
which should be the outer bulwarks separating the sortingbooms from
the channel of the river Ashore the carpenters were knocking together
a long low structure for the cookhouse and a larger building destined
to serve as bunkhouse for the regular boomcrew There would also be a
blacksmiths forge a storehouse a tool and supplyhouse a barn and
small separate shanties for the married men Below more labourers with
picks shovels axes and scrapers were cutting out and levelling a road
which would when finished meet the county road to town The numerous
bayous of great marsh were crossed by floatbridges lying flat on the
surface of the water which spurted up in rhythmical little jets under
the impact of hoofs Down stream eight miles below the mills and just
beyond where the drawbridge crossed over to Monrovia Duncan McLeods
shipyards clipped and sawed and steamed and bent and bolted away at two
tugboats the machinery for which was already being stowed in the hold
of a vessel lying at wharf in Chicago In the storerooms of hardware
firms porters carried and clerks checked off chains strap iron bolts
spikes staples band iron bar iron peavies canthooks pikepoles
sledgehammers blocks ropes and cables

These things took time and attention to details also a careful
supervision The spring increased burst into leaf and bloom and
settled into summer Orde was constantly on the move As soon as
low water came with midsummer however he arranged matters to run
themselves as far as possible left with Newmark minute instructions as
to personal supervision and himself departed to Redding Here he joined
a crew which Tom North had already collected and betook himself to the
head of the river

He knew exactly what he intended to do Far back on the headwaters he
built a dam The construction of it was crude consisting merely of log
cribs filled with stone and debris placed at intervals across the bed
of the stream against which slanted logs made a face The gate operated
simply and could be raised to let loose an entire flood And indeed
this was the whole purpose of the dam It created a reservoir from which
could be freed new supplies of water to eke out the dropping spring
freshets

Having accomplished this formidable labourfor the trees had to be cut
and hauled the stone carted and the earth shovelledthe crew next
moved down a good ten miles to where the river dropped over a rapids
rough and full of boulders Here were built and placed a row of
stonefilled log cribs in a double row down stream to define the channel
and to hold the drive in it and away from the shallows near either bank
The profile of these cribs was that of a rightangled triangle the
slanting side up stream Booms chained between them helped deflect the
drive from the shoals Their more important office however was to give
footing to the drivers

For twentyfive miles then nothing of importance was undertaken Two
or three particularly bad boulders were split out by the explosion
of powder charges a number of snags and old trees were cut away and
disposed of the channel was carefully examined for obstructions of any
kind whatever Then the party came to the falls

Here Orde purposed his most elaborate bit of rough engineering The
falls were only about fifteen feet high but they fell straight down to
a bed of sheer rock This had been eaten by the eddies into potholes
and crannies until a jagged irregular scoophollow had formed
immediately underneath the fall Naturally this implied a ledge below

In flood time the water boiled and roared through this obstruction in
a torrent The saw logs caught in the rush plunged end on into the
scoophollow hit with a crash and were spewed out below more or less
battered barked and stripped Sometimes however when the chance of
the drive brought down a hundred logs together they failed to shoot
over the barrier of the ledge Then followed a jam a bad jam difficult
and dangerous to break The falls had taken her usurious share of the
lives the river annually demands as her toll

This condition of affairs Orde had determined if possible to obviate
From the thirtyfive or forty miles of river that lay above and from
its tributaries would come the bulk of the white and Norway pine for
years to follow At least two thirds of each drive Orde figured would
come from above the fall

If said he to North we could carry an apron on a slant from just
under the crest and over the potholes it would shoot both the water
and the logs off a better angle

Sure agreed North but youll have fun placing your apron with all
that water running through Why it would drown us

Ive got a notion on that said Orde First thing is to get the
material together

A hardwood forest topped the slope Into this went the axemen The
straightest trees they felled trimmed and dragged down travoy trails
they constructed on sleds they built for the purpose to the banks of
the river Here they bored the two holes through either end to receive
the bolts when later they should be locked together side by side in
their places As fast as they were prepared men with canthooks rolled
them down the slope to a flat below the falls They did these things
swiftly and well because they were part of the practised days work
but they shook their heads at the falls

After the trees had been cut in sufficient numberthere were
seventyfive of them each twentysix feet longOrde led the way back
up stream a half mile to a shallows where he commanded the construction
of a number of exaggerated sawhorses with very widespread slanting legs
In the meantime the cookwagon and the bedwagon had evidently been
making many trips to Sand Creek fifteen miles away as was attested by
a large pile of heavy planks When the sawhorses were completed Orde
directed the picks and shovels to be brought up

At this point the river as has been hinted widened over shoals The
banks at either hand too were flat and comparatively low As is often
the case in bends of rivers subject to annual floods the banks sloped
back for some distance into a lower blackash swamp territory

Orde set his men to digging a channel through this bank It was no
slight job from one point of view as the slope down into the swamp
began only at a point forty or fifty feet inland but on the other hand
the earth was soft and free from rocks When completed the channel gave
passage to a rather feeble streamlet from the outer fringe of the river
The men were puzzled but Orde by the strange freak of his otherwise
frank and open nature as usual told nothing of his plans even to Tom
North

He cant expect to turn that river said Tim Nolan who was once more
with the crew Hed have to dig a long ways below that level to catch
the main currentand then some

Let him alone advised North puffing at his short pipe Hes wiser
than a tree full of owls

Next Orde assigned two men to each of the queershaped sawhorses and
instructed them to place the horses in a row across the shallowest
part of the river and broadside to the stream This was done The men
halfway to their knees in the swift water bore down heavily to keep
their charges in place Other men immediately began to lay the heavy
planks side by side perpendicular to and on the upstream side of the
horses The weight of the water clamped them in place big rocks and
gravel shovelled on in quantity prevented the lower ends from rising
the wide slant of the legs directed the pressure so far downward that
the horses were prevented from floating away And slowly the bulk of
the water thus raised a good three feet above its former level turned
aside into the new channel and poured out to inundate the blackash
swamp beyond

A good volume still poured over the top of the temporary dam and down to
the fall but it was by this expedient so far reduced that work became
possible

Now boys cried Orde Lively while weve got the chance

By means of blocks and tackles and the team horses the twentysixfoot
logs were placed side by side slanting from a point two feet below the
rim of the fall to the ledge below They were bolted together top
and bottom through the four holes bored for that purpose This was a
confusing and wet business Sufficient water still flowed in the natural
channel of the river to dash in spray over the entire work Men toiled
wet to the skin their garments clinging to them their eyes full of
water barely able to breathe yet groping doggedly at it and arriving
at last The weather was warm with the midsummer They made a joke of
the difficulty and found inexhaustible humour in the fact that one of
their number was an Immersion Baptist When the task was finished they
pried the flashboards from the improvised dam piled them neatly beyond
reach of high water rescued the sawhorses and piled them also for
a possible future use blocked the temporary channel with a tree or
soand earth The river restored to its immemorial channel by these
men who had so nonchalantly turned it aside roared on singing again
the song it had until now sung uninterruptedly for centuries Orde and
his crew tramped back to the falls and gazed on their handiwork with
satisfaction Instead of plunging over an edge into a turmoil of foam
and eddies now the water flowed smoothly almost without a break over
an incline of thirty degrees

Logsll slip over that slick as a gun barrel said Tom North How
long do you think shell last

Havent an idea replied Orde We may have to do it again next
summer but I dont think it Theres nothing but the smooth of the
water to wear those logs until they begin to rot

Quite cheerfully they took up their long painstaking journey back down
the river

Travel down the river was at times very pleasant and at times very
disagreeable The ground had now hardened so that a wanigan boat was
unnecessary Instead the camp outfit was transported in waggons which
often had to journey far inland to make extraordinary detours but
which always arrived somehow at the various camping places Orde and his
men of course took the river trail

The river trail ran almost unbroken for over a hundred miles of
meandering way It climbed up the high banks at the points it crossed
the bluffs along their sheer edges it descended to the thickets in
the flats it crossed the swamps on poletrails it skirted the great
solemn woods Sometimes in the lower reaches its continuity was broken
by a town but always after it recovered from its confusion it led on
with purpose unvarying Never did it desert for long the river The
cool green still reaches or the tumbling of the whitewater were
always within its sight sometimes beneath its very tread When
occasionally it cut in across a very long bend it always sent from
itself a little tributary trail which traced all the curves and
returned at last to its parent undoubtedly with a full report of its
task And the trail was beaten hard by the feet of countless men who
like Orde and his crew had taken grave interested charge of the river
from her birth to her final rest in the great expanses of the Lake It
is there today although the life that brought it into being has been
gone from it these many years

In midsummer Orde found the river trail most unfamiliar in appearance
Hardly did he recognise it in some places It possessed a wide
leisurely expansiveness an indolent luxury a lazy invitation born of
broad green leaves deep and mysterious shadows the growth of ferns
docks and the like cool in the shade of the forest the shimmer of
aspens and poplars through the heat the green of tangling vines the
drone of insects the lowvoiced call of birds the opulent splashing of
sungold through the woods quite lacking to the hard tight season in
which his river work was usually performed What in the early year
had been merely a whip of brush now had become a screen through whose
waving shifting interstices he caught glimpses of the river flowing
green and cool What had been bare timber amongst whose twigs and
branches the full daylight had shone unobstructed now had clothed
itself in foliage and leaned over to make black and mysterious the water
that flowed beneath Countless insects hovered over the polished surface
of that water Dragonflies cruised about Little birds swooped silently
down and fluttered back intent on their tiny prey Waterbugs skated
hither and thither in apparently purposeless diagonals Once in a great
while the black depths were stirred A bass rolled lazily over carrying
with him his captured insect leaving on the surface of the water
concentric rings which widened and died away

The trail led the crew through many minor labours all of which consumed
time At Reeds Mill Orde entered into diplomatic negotiations with Old
Man Reed whom he found singularly amenable The skirmish in the spring
seemed to have taken all the fight out of him or perhaps more simply
Ordes attitude toward him at that time had won him over to the young
mans side At any rate as soon as he understood that Orde was now in
business for himself he readily came to an agreement Thereupon Ordes
crew built a new sluiceway and gate far enough down to assure a good
head in the pond above Other dam owners farther down the stream also
signed agreements having to do with supplying water over and above what
the law required of them Above one particularly shallow rapid Orde
built a dam of his own

All this took time and the summer months slipped away Orde had fallen
into the wild life as into a habit He lived on the river or the
trail His face took on a ruddier hue than ever his clothes faded to a
nondescript neutral colour of their own his hair below his narrow felt
hat bleached three shades He did his work and figured on his schemes
and smoked his pipe and occasionally took little trips to the nearest
town where he spent the day at the hotel desks reading and answering
his letters The weather was generally very warm Thunderstorms were
not infrequent Until the latter part of August mosquitoes and black
flies were bad

About the middle of September the crew had worked down as far as
Redding leaving behind them a river tamed groomed and harnessed for
their uses Remained still the forty miles between Redding and the
Lake to be improved As however navigation for light draught vessels
extended as far as that city Orde here paid off his men A few days
work with a pile driver would fence the principal shoals from the
channel

He stayed over night with his parents and at once took the train for
Monrovia There he made his way immediately to the little office the new
firm had rented Newmark had just come down

Hullo Joe greeted Orde his teeth flashing in contrast to the tan of
his face Im done Anything new since you wrote last

Newmark had acquired his articles of incorporation and sold his stock
How many excursions demonstrations representations and arguments that
implied only one who has undertaken the floating of a new and untried
scheme can imagine Perhaps his task had in it as much of difficulty as
Ordes taming of the river Certainly he carried it to as successful a
conclusion The bulk of the stock he sold to the logowners themselves
the rest he scattered here and there and everywhere in small lots as
he was able Some five hundred and thousand dollar blocks even went to
Chicago His own little fortune of twenty thousand he paid in for the
shares that represented his half of the majority retained by himself and
Orde The latter gave a note at ten per cent for his proportion of the
stock Newmark then borrowed fifteen thousand more giving as security
a mortgage on the companys newly acquired propertythe tugs booms
buildings and real estate Thus was the financing determined It
left the company with obligations of fifteen hundred dollars a year in
interest expenses which would run heavily into the thousands and an
obligation to make good outside stock worth at par exactly fortynine
thousand dollars In addition Orde had charged against his account a
burden of two thousand dollars a year interest on his personal debt To
offset these liabilitiesoutside the river improvements and equipments
which would hold little or no value in case of failurethe firm held
contracts to deliver about one hundred million feet of logs After some
discussion the partners decided to allow themselves twentyfive hundred
dollars apiece by way of salary

If we dont make any dividends at first Orde pointed out Ive got
to keep even on my interest

You cant live on five hundred objected Newmark

Ill be on the river and at the booms six months of the year replied
Orde and I cant spend much there

Im satisfied said Newmark thoughtfully Im getting a little better
than good interest on my own investment from the start And in a few
years after weve paid up therell be mighty big money in it

He removed his glasses and tapped his palm with their edge

The only point that is at all risky to me said he is that we have
only oneseason contracts If for any reason we hang up the drive or
fail to deliver promptly were going to get left the year following
And then its BUST bust

Well well just try not to hang her replied Orde

Ordes bank account in spite of his laughing assertion to Newmark
contained some eleven hundred dollars After a brief but comprehensive
tour of inspection over all the works then forward he drew a hundred
of this and announced to Newmark that business would take him away for
about two weeks

I have some private affairs to attend to before settling down to
business for keeps he told Newmark vaguely

At Redding whither he went to pack his little soleleather trunk he
told Grandma Orde the same thing She said nothing at the time but
later when Grandpa Ordes slender figure had departed very courteous
very erect very dignified with its old linen duster flapping around
it she came and stood by the man leaning over the trunk

Speak to her Jack said she quietly She cares for you

Orde looked up in astonishment but he did not pretend to deny the
implied accusation as to his destination

Why mother he cried Shes only seen me three or four times Its
absurdyet

I know nodded Grandma Orde wisely I know But you mark my words
she cares for you

She said nothing more but stood looking while Orde folded and laid
away his head bent low in thought Then she placed her hand for
an instant on his shoulder and went away The Ordes were not a
demonstrative people

The journey to New York was at that time very long and disagreeable but
Orde bore it with his accustomed stoicism He had visited the metropolis
before so it was not unfamiliar to him He was very glad however to
get away from the dust and monotony of the railroad train The September
twilight was just falling Through its dusk the street lamps were
popping into illumination as the lamplighter made his rapid way Orde
boarded a horsecar and jingled away down Fourth Avenue He was pleased
at having arrived and stretched his legs and filled his lungs twice
with so evident an enjoyment that several people smiled

His comfort was soon disturbed however by an influx of people boarding
the car at Twentythird Street The seats were immediately filled and
late comers found themselves obliged to stand in the aisle Among these
were several women The men nearest buried themselves in the papers
after the almost universal metropolitan custom Two or three arose to
offer their seats among them Orde When however the latter had turned
to indicate to one of the women the vacated seat he discovered it
occupied by a chubby and flashily dressed youth of the sort common
enough in the vicinity of Fourteenth Street impudent of eye cynical of
demeanour and slightly contemptuous of everything unaccustomed He had
slipped in back of Orde when that young man arose whether under
the impression that Orde was about to get off the car or from sheer
impudence it would be impossible to say

Orde stared at him a little astonished

I intended that seat for this lady said Orde touching him on the
shoulder

The youth looked up coolly

You dont come that said he

Orde wasted no time in discussion which no doubt saved the necessity of
a more serious disturbance He reached over suddenly seized the
youth by the collar braced his knee against the seat and heaved the
interloper so rapidly to his feet that he all but plunged forward among
the passengers sitting opposite

Your seat madam said Orde

The woman frightened unwilling to become the participant of a scene
of any sort stood looking here and there Orde comprehending her
embarrassment twisted his antagonist about and before he could
recover his equilibrium sufficiently to offer resistance propelled him
rapidly to the open door the passengers hastily making way for them

Now my friend said Orde releasing his hold on the others collar
dont do such things any more They arent nice

Trivial as the incident was it served to draw Orde to the particular
notice of an elderly man leaning against the rear rail He was a very
wellgroomed man dressed in garments whose fit was evidently the
product of the highest art well buttoned up well brushed well cared
for in every way In his buttonhole he wore a pink carnation and in his
gloved hand he carried a straight goldheaded cane A silk hat covered
his head from beneath which showed a slightly empurpled countenance
with bushy white eyebrows a white moustache and a pair of rather
bloodshot but kindly blue eyes In spite of his somewhat pudgy
rotundity he carried himself quite erect in a manner that bespoke the
retired military man

You have courage sir said this gentleman inclining his bead gravely
to Orde

The young man laughed in his goodhumoured fashion

Not much courage required to root out that kind of a skunk said he
cheerfully

I refer to the courage of your convictions The young men of this
generation seem to prefer to avoid public disturbances That breed is
quite capable of making a row calling the police raising the deuce
and all that

What of it said Orde

The elderly gentleman puffed out his cheeks

You are from the West are you not he stated rather than asked

We call it the East out there said Orde Its Michigan

I should call that pretty far west said the old gentleman

Nothing more was said After a block or two Orde descended on his way to
a small hotel just off Broadway The old gentleman saluted Orde nodded
goodhumouredly In his private soul he was a little amused at the old
boy To his view a man and clothes carried to their last refinement were
contradictory terms

Orde ate dressed and set out afoot in search of Miss Bishops address
He arrived in front of the house a little past eight oclock and after
a moments hesitation mounted the steps and rang the bell

The door swung silently back to frame an impassive manservant dressed
in livery To Ordes inquiry he stated that Miss Bishop had gone out
to the theatre The young man left his name and a message of regret At
this the footman with an irony so subtle as to be quite lost on Orde
demanded a card Orde scribbled a line in his notebook tore it out
folded it and left it In it he stated his regret his short residence
in the city and desired an early opportunity to call Then he departed
down the brownstone steps totally unconscious of the contempt he had
inspired in the heart of the liveried man behind him

He retired early and arose early as had become his habit When he
descended to the office the night clerk who had not yet been relieved
handed him a note delivered the night before Orde ripped it open
eagerly


MY DEAR MR ORDE

I was so sorry to miss you that evening because of a stupid play Come
around as early as you can tomorrow morning I shall expect you

Sincerely yours

CARROLL BISHOP


Orde glanced at the clock which pointed to seven He breakfasted read
the morning paper finally started leisurely in the direction of West
Ninth Street He walked slowly so as to consume more time then at
University Place was seized with a panic and hurried rapidly to his
destination The door was answered by the same man who had opened the
night before but now in some indefinable way his calm while flawless
externally seemed to have lifted to a mere surface as though he might
hastily have assumed his coat To Ordes inquiry he stated with great
brevity that Miss Bishop was not yet visible and prepared to close the
door

You are mistaken said Orde with equal brevity and stepped inside
I have an engagement with Miss Bishop Tell her Mr Orde is here

The man departed in some doubt leaving Orde standing in the gloomy
hall That young man however quite cheerfully parted the heavy
curtains leading into a parlour and sat down in a spindlelegged chair
At his entrance a maid disappeared out another door carrying with her
the implements of dusting and brushing

Orde looked around the room with some curiosity It was long narrow
and very high Tall windows admitted light at one end The illumination
was however modified greatly by hangings of lace covering all the
windows supplemented by heavy draperies drawn back to either side The
embrasure was occupied by a small table over which seemed to flutter
a beautiful marble Psyche A rubber plant then as now the mark of the
city and suburban dweller sent aloft its spare shiny leaves alongside
a closed square piano The lack of ornaments atop the latter bespoke
the musician Through the filtered gloom of the demilight Orde surveyed
with interest the excellent reproductions of the Old World masterpieces
framed on the wallsMadonnas by Raphael Murillo and Perugino
the Mona Lisa and Botticellis Springthe three oil portraits
occupying the large spaces the spindlelegged chairs and tables the
tea service in the corner the tall bronze lamp by the piano the neat
little gratehearth with its mantel of marble the ormolu clock all
the decorous and decorated gentility which marked the irreproachable
correctness of whoever had furnished the apartment Dark and heavy
hangings depended in front of a double door leading into another room
beyond Equally dark and heavy hangings had closed behind Orde as he
entered An absolute and shrouded stillness seemed to settle down upon
him The ormolu clock ticked steadily Muffled sounds came at long
intervals from behind the portieres Orde began to feel oppressed and
subdued

For quite three quarters of an hour he waited without hearing any
other indications of life than the muffled sounds just remarked upon
Occasionally he shifted his position but cautiously as though he
feared to awaken some one The three oil portraits stared at him with
all the reserved aloofness of their painted eyes He began to doubt
whether the man had announced him at all

Then breaking the stillness with almost startling abruptness he heard
a clear high voice saying something at the top of the stairs outside
A rhythmical SWISH of skirts punctuated by the light PATPAT of a
girl tripping downstairs brought him to his feet A moment later the
curtains parted and she entered holding out her hand

Oh I did keep you waiting such a long time she cried

He stood holding her hand suddenly unable to say a word looking at her
hungrily A flood of emotion of which he had had no prevision swelled
up within him to fill his throat An almost irresistible impulse all but
controlled him to crush her to him to kiss her lips and her throat to
lose his fingers in the soft shadowy fineness of her hair The crest
of the wave passed almost immediately but it left him shaken A faint
colour deepened under the transparence of her skin her fathomless black
eyes widened ever so little she released her hand

It was good of you to come so promptly said she Im so anxious to
hear all about the dear people at Redding

She settled gracefully in one of the little chairs Orde sat down once
more master of himself but still inclined to devour her with his gaze
She was dressed in a morning gown all laces and ribbons and long
flowing lines Her hair was done low on the back of her head and on the
nape of her neck The blood ebbed and flowed beneath her clear skin
A faint fragrance of cleanliness diffused itself about herthe cool
sweet fragrance of daintiness They entered busily into conversation
Her attitudes were no longer relaxed and languidly graceful as in the
easy chairs under the lamplight She sat forward her hands crossed on
her lap a fire smouldering deep beneath the cool surface lights of her
eyes

The sounds in the next room increased in volume as though several
people must have entered that apartment In a moment or so the curtains
to the hall parted to frame the servant

Mrs Bishop wishes to know miss said that functionary if youre
not coming to breakfast

Orde sprang to his feet

Havent you had your breakfast yet he cried conscience stricken

Didnt you gather the fact that Im just up she mocked him I assure
you it doesnt matter The family has just come down

But cried Orde I wasnt here until nine oclock I thought of
course youd be around Im mighty sorry

Oh la la she cried cutting him short What a bother about nothing
Dont you seeIm ahead a whole hour of good talk

You see you told me in your note to come early said Orde

I forgot you were one of those dreadful outdoor men You didnt see any
worms did you Next time Ill tell you to come the day after

Orde was for taking his leave but this she would not have

You must meet my family she negatived For if youre here for so
short a time we want to see something of you Come right out now

Orde thereupon followed her down a narrow dark hall squeezed between
the stairs and the wall to a door that opened slantwise into a
diningroom the exact counterpart in shape to the parlour at the other
side of the house Only in this case the morning sun and more diaphanous
curtains lent an air of brightness further enhanced by a wire stand of
flowers in the bowwindows

The centre of the room was occupied by a round table about which
were grouped several people of different ages With her back to the
bowwindow sat a woman well beyond middle age but with evidently some
pretensions to youth She was tall desiccated quick in movement Dark
rings below her eyes attested either a nervous disease an hysterical
temperament or both Immediately at her left sat a boy of about
fourteen years of age his face a curious contradiction between a
naturally frank and open expression and a growing sullenness Next him
stood a vacant chair evidently for Miss Bishop Opposite lolled a young
man holding a newspaper in one hand and a coffee cup in the other He
was very handsome with a drooping black moustache dark eyes under
lashes almost too luxuriant and a long oval face dark in complexion
and a trifle sardonic in expression In the VISAVIS to Mrs Bishop
Orde was surprised to find his exmilitary friend of the street
car Miss Bishop performed the necessary introductions which each
acknowledged after his fashion but with an apparent indifference that
dashed Orde accustomed to a more Western cordiality Mrs Bishop held
out a languidly graceful hand the boy mumbled a greeting the young man
nodded lazily over his newspaper Only General Bishop recognising him
arose and grasped his hand with a real though rather fussy warmth

My dear sir he cried I am honoured to see you again This my
dear he addressed his wife is the young man I was telling you
aboutin the street car he explained

How very interesting said Mrs Bishop with evidently no
comprehension and less interest

Gerald Bishop cast an ironically amused glance across at Orde The boy
looked up at him quickly the sullenness for a moment gone from his
face

Carroll Bishop appeared quite unconscious of an atmosphere which seemed
to Orde strained but sank into her place at the table and unfolded
her napkin The silent butler drew forward a chair for Orde and stood
looking impassively in Mrs Bishops direction

You will have some breakfast with us she inquired No A cup of
coffee at least

She began to manipulate the coffee pot without paying the slightest
attention to Ordes disclaimer The general puffed out his cheeks and
coughed a bit in embarrassment

A good cup of coffee is never amiss to an old campaigner he said to
Orde Its as good as a full meal in a pinch I remember when I was a
major in the Eleventh down near the City of Mexico in 48 the time
Hardys command was so nearly wiped out by that viaduct He half
turned toward Orde his face lighting up his fingers reaching for the
fork with which after the custom of old soldiers to trace the chart of
his reminiscences

Mrs Bishop rattled her cup and saucer with an uncontrollably nervous
jerk of her slender body For some moments she had awaited a chance to
get the generals attention Spare us father she said brusquely
Will you have another cup of coffee

The old gentleman arrested in midcareer swallowed looked a trifle
bewildered but subsided meekly

No thank you my dear said he and went furiously at his breakfast

Orde overwhelmed by embarrassment discovered that none of the others
had paid the incident the slightest attention Only on the lips of
Gerald Bishop he surprised a fine detached smile

At this moment the butler entered bearing the mail Mrs Bishop tore
hers open rapidly dropping the mangled envelopes at her side The
contents of one seemed to vex her

Oh she cried aloud That miserable Marie She promised me to have it
done today and now she puts it off until Monday Its too provoking
She turned to Orde for sympathy Do you know ANYTHING more aggravating
than to work and slave to the limit of endurance and then have
everything upset by the stupidity of some one else

Orde murmured an appropriate reply to which Mrs Bishop paid no
attention whatever She started suddenly up from the table

I must see about it she cried I plainly see I shall have to do it
myself I WILL do it myself I promised it for Sunday

You mustnt do another stitch mother put in Carroll Bishop
decidedly You know what the doctor told you Youll have yourself down
sick

Well see for yourself cried Mrs Bishop Thats what comes of
leaving things to others If Id done it myself it would have saved me
all this bother and fuss and it would have been done And now Ive got
to do it anyway

My dear put in the general perhaps Carroll can see Marie about it
In any case theres nothing to work yourself up into such an excitement
about

Its very easy for you to talk isnt it cried Mrs Bishop turning
on him I like the way you all sit around like lumps and do nothing
and then tell me how I ought to have done it John have the carriage
around at once She turned tensely to Orde I hope youll excuse me
she said very briefly I have something very important to attend to

Carroll had also risen Orde held out his hand

I must be going said he

Well she conceded I suppose Id better see if I cant help mother
out But youll come in again Come and dine with us this evening
Mother will be delighted

As Mrs Bishop had departed from the room Orde had to take for granted
the expression of this delight He bowed to the other occupants of
the table The general was eating nervously Geralds eyes were fixed
amusedly on Orde

To Ordes surprise he was almost immediately joined on the street by
young Mr Bishop most correctly appointed

Going anywhere in particular he inquired Lets go up the avenue
then Everybody will be out

They turned up the great promenade a tour of which was then even more
than now considered obligatory on the gracefully idle Neither said
anythingOrde because he was too absorbed in the emotions this
sudden revelation of Carrolls environment had aroused in him Gerald
apparently because he was too indifferent Nevertheless it was the
young exquisite who finally broke the silence

It was an altar cloth said he suddenly

What asked Orde rather bewildered

Mother is probably the most devout woman in New York went on Geralds
even voice She is one of the hardest workers in the church She keeps
all the fast days and attends all the services Although she has no
strength to speak of she has just completed an elaborate embroidered
altar cloth The work she accomplished while on her knees Often she
spent five or six hours a day in that position It was very devout but
against the doctors orders and she is at present much pulled down
Finally she gave way to persuasion to the extent of sending the
embroidery out to be bound and corded As a result the altar cloth will
not be done for next Sunday

He delivered this statement in a voice absolutely colourless without
the faintest trace discernible of either approval or disapproval
without the slightest irony yet Orde felt vaguely uncomfortable

It must have been annoying to her he said gravely and I hope she
will get it done in time Perhaps Miss Bishop will be able to do it

That said Gerald is Madison Squareor perhaps you know New York
My sister would of course be only too glad to finish the work but I
fear that my mothers peculiarly ardent temperament will now insist on
her own accomplishment of the task But perhaps you do not understand
temperaments

Very little Im afraid confessed Orde

They walked on for some distance farther

Your father was in the Mexican War said Orde to change the trend of
his own thoughts

He was a most distinguished officer I believe he received the Medal of
Honour for a part in the affair of the Molina del Rey

What command had he in the Civil War asked Orde I fooled around the
outskirts of that a little myself

My father resigned from the army in 54 replied Gerald with his
cool impersonal courtesy

That was too bad just before the chance for more service said Orde

Army life was incompatible with my mothers temperament stated
Gerald

Orde said nothing more It was Geralds turn to end the pause

You are from Redding of course said he My sister is very
enthusiastic about the place You are in business there

Orde replied briefly but forced by the direct cold and polite
crossquestioning of his companion he gave the latter a succinct idea
of the sort of operations in which he was interested

And you he said at last I suppose youre either a broker or lawyer
most men are down here

I am neither one nor the other stated Gerald I am possessed of a
sufficient income from a legacy to make business unnecessary

I dont believe Id care tobe idle said Orde vaguely

There is plenty to occupy ones time replied Gerald I have my
clubs my gymnasium my horse and my friends

Isnt there anything that particularly attracts you asked Orde

The young mans languid eyes grew thoughtful and he puffed more
strongly on his cigarette

I should like said he slowly at last to enter the navy

Why dont you asked Orde bluntly

Certain family reasons make it inexpedient at present said Gerald
My mother is in a very nervous state she depends on us and any hint
of our leaving her is sufficient to render her condition serious

By this time the two young men were well uptown On Geralds initiative
they turned down a side street and shortly came to a stop

That is my gymnasium said Gerald pointing to a building across the
way Wont you come in with me I am due now for my practice




XVII


Ordes evening was a disappointment to him Mrs Bishop had by
Carrolls report worked feverishly at the altar cloth all the
afternoon As a consequence she had gone to bed with a bad headache
This state of affairs seemed to throw the entire family into a state
of indecision It was divided in mind as to what to do the absolute
inutility of any effort balancing strongly against a sense of what the
invalid expected

I wonder if mother wouldnt like just a taste of this beef speculated
the general moving fussily in his chair I believe somebody ought to
take some up She MIGHT want it

The man departed with the plate but returned a few moments later
impassivebut still with the plate

Has she got her hotwater bag asked the boy unexpectedly

Yes Master Kendrick replied the butler

After a preoccupied silence the general again broke out

Seems to me somebody ought to be up there with her

You know father that she cant stand any one in the room said
Carroll equably

Toward the close of the meal however a distant bell tinkled faintly
Every one jumped as though guilty Carroll said a hasty excuse and ran
out After ringing the bell the invalid had evidently anticipated its
answer by emerging from her room to the head of the stairs for Orde
caught the sharp tones of complaint and overheard something about take
all night to eat a simple meal when Im lying here suffering

At the end of an interval a maid appeared in the doorway to say that
Miss Carroll sent word she would not be down again for a time and did
not care for any more dinner This seemed to relieve the generals mind
of responsibility He assumed his little fussy air of cheerfulness
told several stories of the war and finally after Kendrick had left
brought out some whisky and water He winked slyly at Orde

Cant do this before the youngsters you know he chirruped craftily

Throughout the meal Gerald had sat back silent a faint amusement in his
eye After dinner he arose yawned consulted his watch and departed
pleading an engagement Orde lingered some time listening to the
general in the hope that Carroll would reappear She did not so
finally he took his leave

He trudged back to his hotel gloomily The day had passed in a most
unsatisfactory manner according to his way of looking at it Yet he had
come more clearly to an understanding of the girl her cheerfulness her
unselfishness and above all the sweet beautiful philosophy of life
that must lie back to render her so uncomplainingly the slave of the
selfwilled woman yet without the indifferent cynicism of Gerald the
sullen yet real partisanship of Kendrick or the generals weekkneed
acquiescence

The next morning he succeeded in making an arrangement by letter for an
excursion to the newly projected Central Park Promptly at two oclock
he was at the Bishops house To his inquiry the butler said that Mrs
Bishop had recovered from her indisposition and that Miss Bishop would
be down immediately Orde had not long to wait for her The SWISH
PATPAT of her joyous descent of the stairs brought him to his feet She
swept aside the portieres and stood between their folds bidding him
welcome

Im so sorry about last night said she but poor mother does depend
on me so at such times Isnt it a gorgeous day to walk It wont be
much like OUR woods will it But it will be something OH Im so glad
to get out

She was in one of her elfish moods the languid grace of her sleepyeyed
moments forgotten With a little cry of rapture she ran to the piano
and dashed into a gay tinkling air with brilliancy and abandon Her
head surmounted by a perky highpeaked narrowbrimmed hat with a
flaming red bird in front glorified by the braid and waterfall of
that day bent forward and turned to flash an appeal for sympathy toward
Orde

There I feel more able to stay on earth she cried springing to her
feet Now Ill get on my gloves and well start

She turned slowly before the mirror examining quite frankly the hang
of her skirt the fit of her closecut waist the turn of the adorable
round lowcut collars that were then the mode

It pays to be particular we are in New York she answered or
parried Ordes glance of admiration

The gloves finally drawn on and buttoned Orde held aside the portieres
and she passed fairly under his uplifted hand He wanted to drop his
arm about her this slender girl with her quaint dignity her birdlike
ways her gentle graceful mysterious feminine soul The flamered
bird lent its colour to her cheeks her eyes black and fathomless the
pupils wide in this dim light shone with two stars of delight

But as they moved toward the massive front doors Mrs Bishop came
down the stairs behind them She too was dressed for the street She
received Ordes greeting and congratulation over her improved health
in rather an absent manner Indeed as soon as she could hurry this
preliminary over she plunged into what evidently she considered a more
important matter

You arent thinking of going out are you she asked Carroll

I told you mother dont you remember Mr Orde and I are going to get
a little air in the park

Im sorry said Mrs Bishop with great brevity and decision but
Im going to the rectory to help Mr Merritt and I shall want you to go
too to see about the silver

But mother expostulated Carroll wouldnt Marie do just as well

You know very well she cant be trusted without direction

I DO so want to go to the park said Carroll wistfully Mrs Bishops
thin nervous figure jerked spasmodically There is very little asked
of you from morning until night she said with some asperity and I
should think youd have some slight consideration for the fact that Im
just up from a sick bed to spare me all you could Besides which you
do very little for the church I wont insist Do exactly as you think
best

Carroll threw a pathetic glance at Orde

How soon are you going she asked her mother

In about ten minutes replied Mrs Bishop as soon as Ive seen
Honorine about the dinner She seemed abruptly to realise that the
amenities demanded something of her Im sorry we must go so soon she
said briefly to Orde but of course church businessWe shall hope to
see you often

Once more Orde held aside the curtains The flamebird drooped from the
twilight of the hall into the dimness of the parlour All the brightness
seemed to have drained from the day and all the joy of life seemed
to have faded from the girls soul She sank into a chair and tried
pathetically to smile across at Orde

Im such a baby about disappointments said she

I know he replied very gently

And its such a blue and gold day

I know he repeated

She twisted her glove in her lap a bright spot of colour burning in
each cheek

Mother is not well and she has a great deal to try her Poor mother
she said softly her head cast down

I know said Orde in his gentle tones

After a moment he arose to go She remained seated her head down

Im sorry about this afternoon said he cheerfully but it couldnt
be helped could it Jane used to tell me about your harp playing Im
going to come in to hear you this evening May I

Yes she said in a stifled voice and held out her hand She sat
quite still until she heard the front door close after him then she ran
to the curtains and looked after his sturdy square figure as it swung
up the street

Well done oh well done gentle heart she breathed after him Then
she went back to the piano

But Ordes mouth could she have seen it was set in grim lines and
his feet could she have heard them rang on the pavement with quite
superfluous vigour He turned to the left and without pause walked
some ten or twelve miles

The evening turned out very well fortunately Orde could not have stood
much more They had the parlour quite to themselves Carroll took the
cover from the tall harp and leaning her cheek against it she played
dreamily for a half hour Her arms were bare and as her fingers reached
out lingeringly and caressingly to draw the pure golden chords from
the golden instrument her soft bosom pressed against the broad
sounding board There is about the tones of a harp well played something
luminous like rich warm sunlight When the girl muted the strings at
last it seemed to Orde as though all at once the room had perceptibly
darkened He took his leave finally his spirit soothed and restored

Tranquillity was not for long however Ordes visits were naturally
as frequent as possible To them almost instantly Mrs Bishop opposed
the strong and intuitive jealousy of egotism She had as yet no fears as
to the young mans intentions but instinctively she felt an influence
that opposed her own supreme dominance In consequence Orde had much
time to himself Carroll and the rest of the family with the possible
exception of Gerald shared the belief that the slightest real
opposition to Mrs Bishop would suffice to throw her into one of her
spells a condition of alarming and possibly genuine collapse To
drive mother into a spell was an expression of the worst possible
domestic crime It accused the perpetratorthrough Mrs Bishopof
forgetting the state of affairs of ingratitude for care and affection
of common inhumanity and of impiety in rendering impossible of
performance the multifarious church duties Mrs Bishop had invented and
assumed as so many particularly shining virtues Orde soon discovered
that Carroll went out in society very little for the simple reason that
she could never give an unqualified acceptance to an invitation At the
last moment when she had donned her street wraps and the carriage was
at the door she was liable to be called back either to assist at some
religious function which by its sacred character was supposed to have
precedence over everything or to attend a nervous crisis brought on
by some member of the household or by mere untoward circumstances The
girl always acquiesced most sweetly in these recurrent disappointments
And the very fact that she accepted few invitations gave Orde many more
chances to see her in spite of Mrs Bishops increasing exactions
He did not realise this fact however but ground his teeth and clung
blindeyed to his temper whenever the mother cut short his visits or
annulled his engagements on some petty excuse of her own He could
almost believe these interruptions malicious were it not that he soon
discovered Mrs Bishop well disposed toward him personally whenever he
showed himself ready to meet her even quarter way on the topics that
interested herthe church and her health

In this manner the week passed Orde saw as much as he could of Miss
Bishop The remainder of the time he spent walking the streets and
reading in the club rooms to which Geralds courtesy had given him
access Gerald himself seemed to be much occupied Precisely at eleven
every morning however he appeared at the gymnasium for his practice
and in this Orde dropped into the habit of joining him When the young
men first stripped in each others presence they eyed each other with
a secret surprise Geralds slender and elegant body turned out to be
smoothly and gracefully muscled on the long lines of the Flying Mercury
His bones were small but his flesh was hard and his skin healthy with
the flow of blood beneath Orde on the other hand had earned from the
river the torso of an ancient athlete The round full arch of his chest
was topped by a mass of cleancut muscle across his back beneath
the smooth skin the muscles rippled and ridged and dimpled with every
movement the beautiful curve of the deltoids from the point of the
shoulder to the arm met the other beautiful curve of the unflexed
biceps and that fulness of the back arm so often lacking in a onesided
development the surface of the abdomen showed the peculiar corrugation
of the very strong man the round columnar neck arose massive

By Jove said Gerald roused at last from his habitual apathy

Whats the matter asked Orde looking up from tying the rubbersoled
shoes that Gerald had lent him

Murphy called Gerald come here

A very hairy thickset bulletheaded man the type of
semiprofessional handlers emerged from somewhere across the
gymnasium

Do you think you could down this fellow asked Gerald

Murphy looked Orde over critically

Who ye ringin in on me he inquired

This is a friend of mine said Gerald severely

Beg your pardon The gentleman is well put up How much experience has
he had

Ever box much Gerald asked Orde

Box Orde laughed Never had time for that sort of thing Had the
gloves on a few times

Where did you get your training sir asked the handler

My training repeated Orde puzzled Oh I see I was always pretty
heavy and I suppose the work on the river keeps a man in pretty good
shape

Geralds languor had vanished and a glint had appeared in his eye that
would have reminded Orde of Miss Bishops most mischievous mood could he
have seen it

Put on the gloves with Murphy he suggested will you Id like to
see you two at it

Surely agreed Orde goodnaturedly Im not much good at it but Id
just as soon try He was evidently not in the least afraid to meet the
handler though as evidently without much confidence in his own skill

All right Ill be with you in a second said Gerald disappearing In
the anteroom he rung a bell and to the boy who leisurely answered its
summons he said rapidly

Run over to the club and find Mr Winslow Mr Clark and whoever
else is in the smoking room and tell them from me to come over to the
gymnasium Tell them theres some fun on

Then he returned to the gymnasium floor where Murphy was answering
Ordes questions as to the apparatus While the two men were pulling on
the gloves Gerald managed a word apart with the trainer

Can you do him Murph he whispered

Sure said the handler Them kinds always as slow as drayhorses
They gets musclebound

Give it to him said Gerald but dont kill him Hes a friend of
mine

Then he stepped back the same joy in his soul that inspires a
riverman when he encounters a highbanker a hunter when he takes out a
greenhorn or a cowboy as he watches the tenderfoot about to climb the
bronco

Time said he

The first round was sharp When Gerald called the end Orde grinned at
him cheerfully

Dont look like I was much at this game does it said he I wouldnt
pull down many persimmons out of that tree Your confounded mans too
lively I couldnt hit him with a shotgun

Orde had stood like a rock his feet planted to the floor while Murphy
had circled around him hitting at will Orde hit back but without
landing Nevertheless Murphy when questioned apart did not seem
satisfied

The mans pigiron said he I punched him plenty hard enough and it
didnt seem to jar him

The gallery at one end the running track had by now half filled with
interested spectators

Time called Gerald for round two

This time Murphy went in more viciously aiming and measuring his blows
accurately Orde stood as before a humourous smile of selfdepreciation
on his face hitting back at the elusive Murphy but without much
effect his feet never stirring in their tracks The handler used his
best tactics and landed almost at will but without apparent damage He
grew uglyfinally lost his head

Well if ye will have it he muttered and aimed what was intended as
a knockout blow

Gerald uttered a half cry of warning as his practised eye caught
Murphys intention The blow landed Ordes head snapped back but to
the surprise of every one the punch had no other effect and a quick
exchange of infighting sent Murphy staggering back from the encounter
The smile had disappeared from Ordes face and his eye had calmed

Look here he called to Gerald I dont understand this game very
well At school we used taps Is a man supposed to hit hard

Gerald hesitated then looked beyond Orde to the gallery To a man it
made frantic and silent demonstration

Of course you hit he replied You cant hurt any one with those big
gloves

Orde turned back to his antagonist The latter advanced once more
his bullet head sunk between his shoulders his little eyes twinkling
Evidently Mr Bishops friend would now take the aggressive and forward
movement would deliver an extra force to the professionals blows

Orde did not wait for Murphy however Like a tiger he sprang forward
hitting out fiercely first with one hand then with the other Murphy
gave ground blocked ducked exerted all a ring generals skill either
to stop or avoid the rush Orde followed him insistent Several times he
landed but always when Murphy was on the retreat so the blows had
not much weight Several times Murphy ducked in and planted a number of
shortarm jabs at close range The round ended almost immediately to a
storm of applause from the galleries

What do you think of his being musclebound Gerald asked Murphy as
the latter flung himself panting on the wrestling mat for his rest

Hes quick as chained lightning acknowledged the other grudgingly
But Ill get him He cant keep that up hell be winded in half a
minute

Orde sat down on a roll of mat His smile had quite vanished and he
seemed to be awaiting eagerly the beginning of the next round

Time called Gerald for the third

Orde immediately sprang at his adversary repeating the headlong rush
with which the previous round had ended Murphy blocked ducked and
kept away occasionally delivering a jolt as opportunity offered
awaiting the time when Ordes weariness would leave him at the others
mercy That moment did not come The young man hammered away tirelessly
insistently delivering a hurricane of his twohanded blows pressing
relentlessly in as Murphy shifted and gave ground his head up his
eyes steady oblivious to the return hammering the now desperate handler
opposed to him Two minutes passed without perceptible slackening
in this terrific pace The gallery was in an uproar and some of the
members were piling down the stairs to the floor Perspiration stood out
all over Murphys body His blows failed of their effect and some of
Ordes were landing At length bewildered more by the continuance than
the violence of the attack he dropped his ring tactics and closed in to
straight slugging blow against blow stand up give and take

As he saw his opponent stand Orde uttered a sound of satisfaction
He dropped slightly his right shoulder behind his next blow The glove
crashed straight as a piledriver through Murphys upraised hands to
his face which it met with a smack The trainer lifted bodily from
the ground was hurled through the air to land doubled up against the
supports of a parallel bars There he lay quite still his palms up his
head sunk forward

Orde stared at him a moment in astonishment as though expecting him
to arise When however he perceived that Murphy was in reality
unconscious he tore off the gloves and ran forward to kneel by the
professionals side

I didnt suppose one punch like that would hurt him he muttered to
the men crowding around Especially with the gloves Do you suppose
hes killed

But already Murphys arms were making aimless motions and a deep breath
raised his chest

Hes just knocked out reassured one of the men examining the
prostrate handler with a professional attention Hell be as good as
ever in five minutes Here he commanded one of the gymnasium rubbers
who had appeared lend a hand here with some water

The clubmen crowded about all talking at once

Youre a wonder my friend said one

By Jove hes hardly breathing fast after all that rushing said a
second

So you didnt think one punch like that would hurt him quoted another
with goodnatured sarcasm

No said Orde simply Ive hit men that hard before with my bare
fist

Did they survive

Surely

What kind of armourplates were they in heavens name

Orde had recovered his balance and humour

Just plain ordinary rivermen said he with a laugh

Gentlemen struck in Gerald I want to introduce you to my friend
He performed the introductions It was necessary for him to explain
apart that Orde was in reality his friend an amateur a chance visitor
in the city All in all the affair made quite a little stir and went
far to give Orde a standing with these sportloving youths

Finally Gerald and Orde were permitted to finish their gymnasium
practice Murphy had recovered and came forward

You have a strong punch sir and youre a born natural fighter sir
said he If you had a few lessons in boxing sir Id put you against
the best

But later when the young men were resting each under his sheet after
a rubdown the true significance of the affair for Orde came out Since
the fight Geralds customary lassitude of manner seemed quite to have
left him His eye was bright a colour mounted beneath the pale olive of
his skin the almost effeminate beauty of his countenance had animated
He looked across at Orde several times hesitated and at last decided
to speak

Look here Orde said he I want to confess something to you When
you first came here three days ago I had lots of fun with myself about
you You know your clothes arent quite the thing and I thought your
manner was queer and all that I was a cad I want to apologise Youre
a man and I like you better than any fellow Ive met for a long time
And if theres any troublein the futurethat isoh hang it Im on
your sideyou know what I mean

Orde smiled slowly

Bishop was his unexpected reply youre not near so much of a dandy
as you think you are




XVIII


Affairs went thus for a week Orde was much at the Bishop residence
where he was cordially received by the general where he gained an
occasional halfhour with Carroll and where he was almost ignored by
Mrs Bishop in her complete selfabsorption Indeed it is to be doubted
whether he attained any real individuality to that lady who looked on
all the world outside her family as useful or useless to the church

In the course of the happy moments he had alone with Carroll he
arrived at a more intimate plane of conversation with her He came to an
understanding of her unquestioning acceptance of Mrs Bishops attitude
Carroll truly believed that none but herself could perform for her
mother the various petty offices that lady demanded from her next of
kin and that her practical slavery was due by every consideration of
filial affection To Ordes occasional tentative suggestion that the
service was of a sort better suited to a paid companion or even a
housemaid she answered quite seriously that it made mother nervous to
have others about her and that it was better to do these things than to
throw her into a spell Orde chafed at first over seeing his precious
opportunities thus filched from him later he fretted because he
perceived that Carroll was forced however willingly to labours beyond
her strength to irksome confinement and to that intimate and wearing
close association with the abnormal which in the long run is bound to
deaden the spirit He lost sight of his own grievance in the matter
With perhaps somewhat of exaggeration he came mightily to desire for her
more of the open air both of body and spirit Often when tramping back
to his hotel he communed savagely with himself turning the problem over
and over in his mind until like a snowball it had gathered to itself
colossal proportions

And in his hotel room he brooded over the state of affairs until his
thoughts took a very gloomy tinge indeed To begin with in spite of his
mothers assurance he had no faith in his own cause His acquaintance
with Carroll was but an affair of months and their actual meetings
comprised incredibly few days Orde was naturally humbleminded It
did not seem conceivable to him that he could win her without a long
courtship And superadded was the almost intolerable weight of Carrolls
ideas as to her domestic duties Although Orde held Mrs Bishops
exactions in very slight esteem and was most sceptical in regard to
the disasters that would follow their thwarting nevertheless he had to
confess to himself that all Carrolls training life the very purity
and sweetness of her disposition lent the situation an iron reality for
her He became much discouraged

Nevertheless at the very moment when he had made up his mind that it
would be utterly useless even to indulge in hope for some years to come
he spoke It came about suddenly and entirely without premeditation

The two had escaped for a breath of air late in the evening Following
the conventions they merely strolled to the end of the block and back
always within sight of the house Fifth Avenue was gay with illumination
and the prancing of horses returning uptown or down to the Washington
Square district In contrast the side street with its austere rows of
brownstone houses each with its area and flight of steps its spaced
gas lamps its deserted roadway seemed very still and quiet Carroll
was in a tired and pensive mood She held her head back breathing
deeply

Its only a little strip but its the stars said she looking up to
the sky between the houses Theyre so quiet and calm and big

She seemed to Orde for the first time like a little girl The maturer
complexities which we put on with years with experience and with the
knowledge of life had for the moment fallen from her leaving merely the
simple soul of childhood gazing in its eternal wonder at the stars A
wave of tenderness lifted Orde from his feet He leaned over his breath
coming quickly

Carroll he said

She looked up at him and shrank back

No no You mustnt she cried She did not pretend to misunderstand
The preliminaries seemed in some mysterious fashion to have been said
long ago

Its life or death with me he said

I must not she cried fluttering like a bird I promised myself long
ago that I must always ALWAYS take care of mother

Please please dear pleaded Orde He had nothing more to say than
this just the simple incoherent symbols of pleading but in such crises
it is rather the soul than the tongue that speaks His hand met hers and
closed about it It did not respond to his grasp nor did it draw away
but lay limp and warm and helpless in his own

She shook her head slowly

Dont you care for me dear asked Orde very gently

I have no right to tell you that answered she I have tried oh so
hard to keep you from saying this for I knew I had no right to hear
you

Ordes heart leaped with a wild exultation

You do care for me he cried

They had mounted the steps and stood just within the vestibule Orde
drew her toward him but she repulsed him gently

No she shook her head Please be very good to me Im very weak

Carroll cried Orde Tell me that you love me Tell me that youll
marry me

It would kill mother if I should leave her she said sadly

But you must marry me pleaded Orde We are made for each other God
meant us for each other

It would have to be after a great many years she said doubtfully

She pulled the bell which jangled faintly in the depths of the house

Goodnight she said Come to me tomorrow No you must not come
in She cut short Ordes insistence and the eloquence that had just
found its life by slipping inside the halfopen door and closing it
after her

Orde stood for a moment uncertain then turned away and walked up the
street his eyes so blinded by the greater glory that he all but ran
down an inoffensive passerby

At the hotel he wrote a long letter to his mother The first part was
full of the exultation of his discovery He told of his good fortune
quite as something just born utterly forgetting his mothers
predictions before he came East Then as the first effervescence died
a more gloomy view of the situation came uppermost To his heated
imagination the deadlock seemed complete Carrolls devotion to what she
considered her duty appeared unbreakable In the reaction Orde doubted
whether he would have it otherwise And then his fighting blood surged
back to his heart All the eloquence the arguments the pleadings he
should have commanded earlier in the evening hurried belated to their
posts After the manner of the young and imaginative when in the
white fire of emotion he began dramatising scenes between Carroll and
himself He saw them plainly He heard the sound of his own voice as
he rehearsed the arguments which should break her resolution A womans
duty to her own soul her obligation toward the man she could make or
mar by her love her selfrespect the necessity of a break some time
the advantage of having the crisis over with now rather than later a
belief in the ultimate good even to Mrs Bishop of throwing that
lady more on her own resources and so forth and so on down a list of
arguments obvious enough or trivial enough but all inspired by the soul
of fervour all ennobled by the spirit of truth that lies back of the
major premise that a woman should cleave to a man forsaking all others
Orde sat back in his chair his eyes vacant his pen all but falling
from his hand He did not finish the letter to his mother After a while
he went upstairs to his own room

The fever of the argument coursed through his veins all that long night
Over and over again he rehearsed it in wearisome repetition until it had
assumed a certain and almost invariable form And when he had reached
the end of his pleading he began it over again until the daylight found
him weary and fevered He arose and dressed himself He could eat no
breakfast By a tremendous effort of the will he restrained himself from
going over to Ninth Street until the middle of the morning

He entered the drawingroom to find her seated at the piano His heart
bounded and for an instant he stood still summoning his forces to the
struggle for which he had so painfully gathered his ammunition She did
not look up as he approached until he stood almost at her shoulder Then
she turned to him and held out both her hands

It is no use Jack she said I care for you too much I will marry
you whenever you say




XIX


Orde left that evening early This was at Carrolls request She
preferred herself to inform her family of the news

I dont know yet how mother is going to get along said she Come
back tomorrow afternoon and see them all

The next morning Orde having at last finished and despatched the letter
to his mother drifted up the avenue and into the club As he passed
the smoking room he caught sight of Gerald seated in an armchair by the
window He entered the room and took a seat opposite the young fellow

Gerald held out his hand silently which the other took

Im glad to hear it said Gerald at last Very glad I told you I
was on your side He hesitated then went on gravely Poor Carroll is
having a hard time though I think its worse than she expected Its
no worse than I expected You are to be one of the family so I am going
to give you a piece of advice Its something naturally I wouldnt
speak of otherwise But Carroll is my only sister and I want her to be
happy I think you are the man to make her so but I want you to avoid
one mistake Fight it out right now and never give back the ground you
win

I feel that replied Orde quietly

Mother made father resign from the army and while hes a dear old boy
hes never done anything since She holds mealthough I see through
herpossibly because Im weak or indifferent possibly because I have
a silly idea I can make a bad situation better by hanging around She is
rapidly turning Kendrick into a sullen little prig because he believes
implicitly all the grievances against the world and the individual she
pours out to him You see I have no illusions concerning my family
Only Carroll has held to her freedom of soul because thats the joyous
free sweet nature of her bless her For the first time shes pitted
her will against mothers and its a bad clash

Your mother objected asked Orde

Gerald laughed a little bitterly It was very bad said he Youve
grown horns hoofs and a tail overnight Theres nothing too criminal
to have escaped your notice I have been forbidden to consort with you
So has the general The battle of last night had to do with your coming
to the house at all As it is not Carrolls house naturally she has no
right to insist

I shall not be permitted to see her cried Orde

I did not say that Carroll announced then quite openly that she would
see you outside I fancy that was the crux of the matter Dont you
see The whole affair shifted ground Carroll has offered direct
disobedience Oh shes a bully little fighter he finished in admiring
accents You cant quite realise what shes doing for your sake shes
not only fighting mother but her own heart

Orde found a note at the hotel asking him to be in Washington Square at
halfpast two

Carroll met him with a bright smile

Things arent quite right at home she said It is a great shock to
poor mother at first and she feels very strongly Oh it isnt you
dear its the notion that I can care for anybody but her You see
shes been used to the other idea so long that I suppose it seemed a
part of the universe to her Shell get used to it after a little but
it takes time

Orde examined her face anxiously Two bright red spots burned on her
cheeks her eyes flashed with a nervous animation and a faint shade had
sketched itself beneath them

You had a hard time he murmured you poor dear

She smiled up at him

We have to pay for the good things in life dont we dear And they
are worth it Things will come right after a little We must not be too
impatient Now lets enjoy the day The park isnt so bad is it

At five oclock Orde took her back to her doorstep where he left her

This went on for several days

At the end of that time Orde could not conceal from himself that the
strain was beginning to tell Carrolls worried expression grew from
day to day while the animation that characterised her manner when
freed from the restraint became more and more forced She was as though
dominated by some inner tensity which she dared not relax even for a
moment To Ordes questionings she replied as evasively as she could
assuring him always that matters were going as well as she had expected
that mother was very difficult that Orde must have patience for things
would surely come all right She begged him to remain quiescent until
she gave him the word and she implored it so earnestly that Orde
though he chafed was forced to await the turn of events Every
afternoon she met him from two to five The situation gave little
opportunity for lovers demonstrations She seemed entirely absorbed by
the inner stress of the struggle she was going through so that hardly
did she seem able to follow coherently even plans for the future She
appeared however to gain a mysterious refreshment from Ordes
mere proximity so gradually he with that streak of almost feminine
intuition which is the especial gift to lovers came to the point of
sitting quite silent with her clasping her hand out of sight of the
chance passerby When the time came to return they arose and walked
back to Ninth Street still in silence At the door they said goodbye
He kissed her quite soberly

I wish I could help sweetheart said he

She shook her head at him

You do help she replied

From Gerald at the club Orde sought more intimate news of what was
going on For several days however the young man absented himself from
his usual haunts It was only at the end of the week that Orde succeeded
in finding him

No Gerald answered his greeting I havent been around much Ive
been sticking pretty close home

Little by little Ordes eager questions drew out the truth of the
situation Mrs Bishop had shut herself up in a blind and incredible
obstinacy whence she sallied with floods of complaints tears
accusations despairs reproaches vows hystericsall the battery
of the woman misunderstood but in which she refused to listen to a
consecutive conversation If Carroll undertook to say anything
the third word would start her mother off into one of her long and
hysterical tirades It was very wearing and there seemed to be nothing
gained from day to day Her child had disobeyed her And as a climax
she had assumed the impregnable position of a complete prostration
wherein she demanded the minute care of an invalid in the crisis of a
disorder She could bear no faintest ray of illumination no lightest
footfall In a hushed twilight she lay her eyes swathed moaning feebly
that her early dissolution at the hands of ingratitude was imminent
Thus she established a deadlock which was likely to continue
indefinitely The mere mention of the subject nearest Carrolls heart
brought the feeble complaint

Do you want to kill me

The only scrap of victory to be snatched from this stricken field
was the fact that Carroll insisted on going to meet her lover every
afternoon The invalid demanded every moment of her time either for
personal attendance or in fulfilment of numerous and exacting church
duties An attempt however to encroach thus on the afternoon hours met
a stone wall of resolution on Carrolls part

This was the situation Orde gathered from his talk with Gerald Though
he fretted under the tyranny exacted he could see nothing which could
relieve the situation save his own withdrawal He had already long
overstayed his visit important affairs connected with his work
demanded his attention he had the comfort of Carrolls love assured
and the lapse of time alone could be depended on to change Mrs Bishops
attitude a consummation on which Carroll seemed set Although Orde felt
all the lively dissatisfaction natural to a newly accepted lover who
had gained slight opportunity for favours for confidences even for the
making of plans nevertheless he could see for the present nothing else
to do

The morning after he had reached this conclusion he again met Gerald
at the gymnasium That young man while as imperturbable and languid in
movement as ever concealed an excitement He explained nothing until
the two after a shower and rubdown were clothing themselves leisurely
in the empty couchroom

Orde said Gerald suddenly Im worried about Carroll

Orde straightened his back and looked steadily at Gerald but said
nothing

Mother has commenced bothering her again It wasnt so bad as long as
she stuck to daytime but now shes taken to prowling in a dozen times a
night I hear their voices for an hour or so at a time Im afraid its
beginning to wear on Carroll more than you realise

Thank you said Orde briefly

That afternoon with Carroll he took the affair firmly in hand

This thing has come to the point where it must stop said he and
Im going to stop it I have some rights in the matter of the health and
comfort of the girl I love

What do you intend to do asked Carroll frightened

I shall have it out with your mother replied Orde

You mustnt do that implored Carroll It would do absolutely no
good and would just result in a quarrel that could never be patched
up

I dont know as I care particularly said Orde

But I do Thinkshe is my mother

Orde stirred uneasily with a mental reservation as to selfishness but
said nothing

And think what it means to a girl to be married and go away from home
finally without her parents consent Its the most beautiful and sacred
thing in her life and she wants it to be perfect Its worth waiting
and fighting a little for After all we are both young and we have
known each other such a very short time

So she pleaded with him bringing forward all the unanswerable arguments
built by the long average experience of the worldarguments which
Orde could not refute but whose falsity to the situation he felt most
keenly He could not specify without betraying Geralds confidence
Raging inwardly he consented to a further armistice

At his hotel he found a telegram He did not open it until he had
reached his own room It was from home urging his immediate return for
the acceptance of some contracted work

To hell with the contracted work he muttered savagely and calling a
bellboy sent an answer very much to that effect Then he plunged his
hands into his pockets stretched out his legs and fell into a deep and
gloomy meditation

He was interrupted by a knock on the door

Come in he called without turning his head

He heard the door open and shut After a moment he looked around
Kendrick Bishop stood watching him

Orde lit the gas

Hello Kendrick said he Sit down The boy made no reply Orde
looked at him curiously and saw that he was suffering from an intense
excitement His frame trembled convulsively his lips were white his
face went red and pale by turns Evidently he had something to say but
could not yet trust his voice Orde sat down and waited

Youve got to let my mother alone he managed to say finally

I have done nothing to your mother Kendrick said Orde kindly

Youve brought her to the point of death asserted Keudrick violently
Youre hounding her to her grave Youre turning those she loves best
against her

Orde thought to catch the echo of quotation in these words

Did your mother send you to me he asked

If we had any one else worth the name of man in the family I wouldnt
have to come said Kendrick almost in the manner of one repeating a
lesson

What do you want me to do asked Orde after a moment of thought

Go away cried Kendrick Stop this unmanly contest against a
defenceless woman

I cannot do that replied Orde quietly

Kendricks face assumed a livid pallor and his eyes seemed to turn
black with excitement Trembling in every limb but without hesitation
he advanced on Orde drew a short ridingwhip from beneath his coat and
slashed the young man across the face Orde made an involuntary movement
to arise but sank back and looked steadily at the boy Once again
Kendrick hit raised his arm for the third time hesitated His lips
writhed and then with a sob he cast the little whip from him and
burst from the room

Orde sat without moving while two red lines slowly defined themselves
across his face The theatrical quality of the scene and the turgid
rhetorical bathos of the boys speeches attested his youth and the
unformed violence of his emotions Did they also indicate a rehearsal
or had the boy merely been goaded to vague action by implicit belief in
a womans vagaries Orde did not know but the incident brought home to
him as nothing else could the turmoil of that household

Poor youngster he concluded his reverie and went to wash his face in
hot water

He had left Carroll that afternoon in a comparatively philosophical
and hopeful frame of mind The next day she came to him with hurried
nervous steps her usually pale cheeks mounting danger signals of
flaming red her eyes swimming When she greeted him she choked and two
of the tears overflowed Quite unmindful of the nursemaids across the
square Orde put his arm comfortingly about her shoulder She hid her
face against his sleeve and began softly to cry

Orde did not attempt as yet to draw from her the cause of this unusual
agitation A park bench stood between two dense bushes screened from
all directions save one To this he led her He comforted her as one
comforts a child stroking clumsily her hair murmuring trivialities
without meaning letting her emotion relieve itself After awhile she
recovered somewhat her control of herself and sat up away from him
dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief dampened into a tiny wad But
even after she had shaken her head vigorously at last and smiled up at
him rather tremulously in token that the storm was over she would not
tell him that anything definite had happened to bring on the outburst

I just needed you she said thats all Its just nothing but being
a woman I think Youll get used to little things like that

This thing has got to quit said he grimly

She said nothing but reached up shyly and touched his face where
Kendricks whip had stung and her eyes became very tender A carriage
rolled around Washington Arch and coming to a stand discharged its
single passenger on the pavement

Why its Gerald cried Carroll surprised

The young man catching sight of them picked his way daintily and
leisurely toward them He was as usual dressed with meticulous nicety
the carnation in his buttonhole the gloss on his hat and shoes the
freshness on his gloves the correct angle on his stick His dark long
face with its romantic moustache and its almost effeminate soft eyes
was as unemotional and wearied as ever As he approached he raised his
stick slightly by way of salutation

I have brought said he a carriage and I wish you would both do me
the favour to accompany me on a short excursion

Taking their consent for granted he signalled the vehicle which
rapidly approached

The threeCarroll and Orde somewhat bewilderedtook their seats
During a brief drive Gerald made conversation on different topics
apparently quite indifferent as to whether or not his companions
replied After an interval the carriage drew up opposite a brownstone
dwelling on a side street Gerald rang the bell and a moment later the
three were ushered by a discreet and elderly maid into a little square
receptionroom immediately off the hall The maid withdrew

Gerald carefully deposited his top hat on the floor placed in it his
gloves and leaned his stick against its brim

I have brought you here among other purposes to hear from me a little
brief wisdom drawn from experience and the observation of life he
began addressing his expectant and curious guests That wisdom is
briefly this there comes a time in the affairs of every household when
a man must assert himself as the ruler In all the details he may depend
on the womans judgment experience and knowledge but when it comes to
the big crises where life is deflected into one channel or the other
then unless the man does the deciding he is lost for ever and
his happiness and the happiness of those who depend on him This is
abstruse but I come to the particular application shortly

But moments of decision are always clouded by many considerations The
decision is sure to cut across much that is expedient much that seems
to be necessary much that is dear Carroll remembers the case of our
own father The general would have made a name for himself in the army
his wife demanded his retirement he retired and his career ended That
was the moment of his decision It is very easy to say in view of that
simple statement that the general was weak in yielding to his wife but
a consideration of the circumstances

Why do you say all this interrupted Orde

Gerald raised his hand

Believe me it is necessary as you will agree when you have heard me
through Mrs Bishop was in poor health the general in poor financial
circumstances The doctors said the Riviera Mrs Bishops parents who
were wealthy furnished the money for her sojourn in that climate She
could not bear to be separated from her husband A refusal to resign
then a refusal to accept the financial aid offered would have been
cast against him as a reproachhe did not love his wife enough to
sacrifice his pride his ambition his whatyouwill Nevertheless that
was his moment of decision

I could multiply instances yet it would only accumulate needless
proof My point is that in these great moments a man can afford to
take into consideration only the affair itself Never must he think of
anything but the simple elements of the problemhe must ignore whose
toes are trodden upon whose feelings are hurt whose happiness is
apparently marred For note this if a man does fearlessly the right
thing I am convinced that in the readjustment all these conflicting
interests find themselves bettered instead of injured You want a
concrete instance I believe firmly that if the general had kept to his
army life and made his wife conform to it after the storm had passed
she would have settled down to a happy existence I cannot prove itI
believe it

This may be all very true Gerald said Orde but I fail to see why
you have brought us to this strange house to tell it

In a moment replied Gerald Have patience Believing that
thoroughly I have come in the last twentyfour hours to a decision
That this happens not to affect my own immediate fortunes does not seem
to me to invalidate my philosophy

He carefully unbuttoned his frock coat crossed his legs produced a
paper and a package from his inside pocket and eyed the two before him

I have here he went on suddenly marriage papers duly made out
in this package is a plain gold ring in the next room is waiting by
prearrangement a very good friend of mine in the clergy Personally I
am at your disposal

He looked at them expectantly

The very thing Oh no cried Orde and Carroll in unison

Nevertheless in spite of this divergence of opinion ten minutes later
the three passed through the door into the back apartmentCarroll still
hesitant Orde in triumph Gerald as correct and unemotional as ever

In this back room they found waiting a young clergyman conversing easily
with two young girls At the sight of Carroll these latter rushed
forward and overwhelmed her with endearments Carroll broke into a
quickly suppressed sob and clasped them close to her

Oh you dears she cried Im so glad youre here She flashed a
grateful look in Geralds direction and a moment later took occasion to
press his arm and whisper

Youve thought of everything Youre the dearest brother in the world

Gerald received this calmly and set about organising the ceremony In
fifteen minutes the little party separated at the front door amid a
chatter of congratulations and good wishes Mr and Mrs Orde entered
the cab and drove away

Oh it IS the best way dear after all cried Carroll pressing close
to her husband A few minutes ago I was all doubts and fears but now
I feel so safe and settled she laughed happily It is as though I
had belonged to you always you old Rock of Gibraltar and anything that
happens now will come from the outside and not from the inside wont
it dear

Yes sweetheart said Orde

Poor mother I wonder how shell take it

Well soon know anyway replied Orde a little grimly

In the hallway of the Bishop house Orde kissed her

Be brave sweetheart said he but remember that now youre my wife

She nodded at him gravely and disappeared

Orde sat in the dim parlour for what seemed to be an interminable
period Occasionally the sounds of distant voices rose to his ear and
died away again The front door opened to admit some one but Orde
could not see who it was Twice a scurrying of feet overhead seemed to
indicate the bustle of excitement The afternoon waned A faint whiff
of cooking escaping through some carelessly open door was borne to
his nostrils It grew dark but the lamps remained unlighted Finally he
heard the rustle of the portieres and turned to see the dim form of the
general standing there

Bad business bad business muttered the old man Its very hard
on me Perhaps you did the right thingyou must be good to herbut I
cannot countenance this affair It was most highhanded sir

The portieres fell again and he disappeared

Finally after another interval Carroll returned She went immediately
to the gasfixture which she lit Orde then saw that she was sobbing
violently She came to him and for a moment hid her face against his
breast He patted her hair waiting for her to speak After a little she
controlled herself

How was it asked Orde then

She shivered

I never knew people could be so cruel she complained in almost a
bewildered manner Jack we must go tonight Sheshe has ordered me
out of the house and says she never wants to see my face again She
broke down for a second Oh Jack she cant mean that Ive always
been a good daughter to her And shes very bitter against Gerald Oh
I told her it wasnt his fault but she wont listen She sent for
that odious Mr Merritther rector you knowand he supported her I
believe hes angry because we did not go to him Could you believe
such a thing And shes shut herself up in her air of high virtue and
underneath it shes oh so angry

Well its natural she should be upset comforted Orde Dont think
too much of what she does now Later shell get over it

Carroll shivered again

You dont know dear and Im not going to tell you Why she cried
she told me that you and I were in a conspiracy to drive her to her
grave so we could get her money

She must be a little crazy said Orde still pacifically

Come help me said Carroll I must get my things

Cant you just pack a bag and leave the rest until tomorrow Its about
hungry time

She says I must take every stitch belonging to me tonight

They packed trunks until late that night quite alone Gerald had
departed promptly after breaking the news probably without realising
to what a pass affairs would come A frightened servant evidently in
disobedience of orders and in fear of destruction brought them a tray
of food which she put down on a small table and hastily fled In a room
down the hall they could hear the murmur of voices where Mrs Bishop
received spiritual consolation from her adviser When the trunks were
packed Orde sent for a baggage waggon Carroll went silently from place
to place saying farewell to such of her treasures as she had made up
her mind to leave Orde scribbled a note to Gerald requesting him
to pack up the miscellanies and send them to Michigan by freight The
baggage man and Orde carried the trunks downstairs No one appeared
Carroll and Orde walked together to the hotel Next morning an interview
with Gerald confirmed them in their resolution of immediate departure

She is set in her opposition now and at present she believes firmly
that her influence will separate you Such a state of mind cannot be
changed in an hour

And you asked Carroll

Oh I he shrugged will go on as usual I have my interests

I wish you would come out in our part of the country ventured Orde

Gerald smiled his fine smile

Goodbye said he Going to a train is useless and a bore to
everybody

Carroll threw herself on his neck in an access of passionate weeping

You WILL write and tell me of everything wont you she begged

Of course There now goodbye

Orde followed him into the hall

It would be quite useless to attempt another interview he inquired

Gerald made a little mouth

I am in the same predicament as yourselves said he and have since
nine this morning taken up my quarters at the club Please do not tell
Carroll it would only pain her

At the station just before they passed in to the train the general
appeared

There there he fussed If your mother should hear of my being here
it would be a very bad business very bad This is very sad butwell
goodbye dear and you sir be good to her And write your daddy
Carroll Hell be lonesome for you He blew his nose very loudly and
wiped his glasses Now run along run along he hurried them Let us
not have any scenes Here my dear open this envelope when you are well
started It may help cheer the journey Not a word

He hurried them through the gate paying no heed to what they were
trying to say Then he steamed away and bustled into a cab without once
looking back

When the train had passed the Harlem River and was swaying its uneven
way across the open country Carroll opened the envelope It contained a
check for a thousand dollars

Dear old daddy she murmured Our only wedding present

You are the capitalist of the family said Orde You dont know
how poor a man youve married I havent much more than the proverbial
silver watch and bad nickel

She reached out to press his hand in reassurance He compared it
humorously with his own

What a homely knotted tanned old thing it is by yours said he

Its a strong hand she replied soberly its a dear hand Suddenly
she snatched it up and pressed it for a fleeting instant against her
cheek looking at him half ashamed

The winter months were spent at Monrovia where Orde and his wife lived
for a time at the hotel This was somewhat expensive but Orde was not
quite ready to decide on a home and he developed unexpected opposition
to living at Redding in the Orde homestead

No Ive been thinking about it he told Grandma Orde A young couple
should start out on their own responsibility I know youd be glad to
have us but I think its better the other way Besides I must be at
Monrovia a good deal of the time and I want Carroll with me She can
make you a good long visit in the spring when I have to go up river

To this Grandma Orde being a wise old lady had to nod her assent
although she would much have liked her son near her

At Monrovia then they took up their quarters Carroll soon became
acquainted with the life of the place Monrovia like most towns of its
sort and size consisted of an upper stratum of mill owners and lumber
operators possessed of considerable wealth some cultivation
and definite social ideas a gawky countrified middle estate of
storekeepers catering both to the farm and local trade and the lumber
mill operatives generally of Holland extraction who dwelt in simple
unpainted board shanties The class first mentioned comprised a small
coterie among whom Carroll soon found two or three congenialsEdith
Fuller wife of the young cashier in the bank Valerie Cathcart whose
husband had been killed in the Civil War Clara Taylor wife of the
leading young lawyer of the village and strangely enough Mina
Heinzman the sixteenyearold daughter of old Heinzman the lumberman
Nothing was more indicative of the absolute divorce of business and
social life than the unbroken evenness of Carrolls friendship for the
younger girl Though later the old German and Orde locked in serious
struggle on the river they continued to meet socially quite as usual
and the daughter of one and the wife of the other never suspected
anything out of the ordinary This impersonality of struggle has always
been characteristic of the pioneer business mans goodnature

Newmark received the news of his partners sudden marriage without
evincing any surprise but with a sardonic gleam in one corner of his
eye He called promptly conversed politely for a half hour and then
took his leave

How do you like him asked Orde when he had gone

He looks like a very shrewd man replied Carroll picking her words
for fear of saying the wrong thing

Orde laughed

You dont like him he stated

I dont dislike him said Carroll Ive not a thing against him
But we could never be in the slightest degree sympathetic He and I
dontdont

Dont jibe Orde finished for her I didnt much think you would Joe
never was much of a society bug It was on the tip of Carrolls
tongue to reply that society bugs were not the only sort she could
appreciate but she refrained She had begun to realise the extent of
her influence over her husbands opinion

Newmark did not live at the hotel Early in the fall he had rented a
small onestory house situated just off Main Street set well back from
the sidewalk among clumps of oleanders Into this he retired as a snail
into its shell At first he took his meals at the hotel but later he
imported an impassive secretive manservant who took charge of
him completely Neither master nor man made any friends and in fact
rebuffed all advances One Sunday Carroll and Orde out for a walk
passed this quaint little place with its picket fence

Lets go in and return Joes call suggested Orde

Their knock at the door brought the calm valet

Mr Newmark is hout sir said he Yes sir Ill tell him that you
called

They turned away As they sauntered down the little bricklaid walk
Carroll suddenly pressed close to her husbands arm

Jack she begged I want a little house like that for our very own

We cant afford it sweetheart

Not to own she explained just to rent It will be next best to
having a home of our own

Wed have to have a girl dear said Orde and we cant even afford
that yet

A girl cried Carroll indignantly For us two

You couldnt do the housework and the cooking said Orde Youve
never done such a thing in your life and I wont have my little girl
slaving

It wont be slaving it will be funjust like playhousekeeping
protested Carroll And Ive got to learn some time I was brought up
most absurdly and I realise it now

Well see said Orde vaguely

The subject was dropped for the time being Later Carroll brought it up
again She was armed with several sheets of hotel stationery covered
with figures showing how much cheaper it would be to keep house than to
board

You certainly make out a strong caseon paper laughed Orde If you
buy a rooster and a hen and she raises two broods at the end of a
year youll have twentysix and if they all breedeven allowing half
roostersyoull have over three hundred and if they all breed youll
have about thirtyfive hundred and if

Stop stop cried Carroll covering her ears

All right agreed Orde equably but thats the way it figures Funny
the earth isnt overrun with chickens isnt it

She thrust her tables of figures into her desk drawer Youre just
making fun of me always she said reproachfully

Two days later Orde took her one block up the street to look at a
tiny little house tucked on a fiftyfoot lot beneath the shadow of the
church

Its mighty little said he Ill have to go out in the hall to
change my collar and we couldnt have more than two people at a time to
call on us

Its a dear said she and Im not so enormous myself whatever YOU
may be

They ended by renting the little house and Carroll took charge of it
delightedly What difficulties she overcame and what laughable and
cryable mistakes she made only those who have encountered a like
situation could realise She learned fast however and took a real
pride in her tiny box of a home A piano was of course out of the
question but the great golden harp occupied one corner or rather
one side of the parlour Standing thus enshrouded in its covering it
rather resembled an august and tremendous veiled deity To Carrolls
great delight Orde used solemnly to go down on all fours and knock
his forehead thrice on the floor before it when he entered the house
at evening When the very cold weather came and they had to light the
baseburner stove which Orde stoutly maintained occupied all the other
half of the parlour the harps delicate constitution necessitated its
standing in the hall Nevertheless Carroll had great comfort from it
While Orde was away at the office she whispered through its mellow
strings her great happiness the dreams for her young motherhood which
would come in the summer the vague and lingering pain over the hapless
but beloved ones she had left behind her in her other life Then she
arose refreshed and went about the simple duties of her tiny domain

The winter was severe All the world was white The piles of snow along
the sidewalks grew until Carroll could hardly look over them Great
fierce winds swept in from the lake Sometimes Orde and his wife drove
two miles to the top of the sand hills where first they had met in this
their present home and looked out beyond the tumbled shore ice to the
steelgray angry waters The wind pricked their faces and going
home the sleighbells jingled the snowballs from the horses hoofs hit
against the dash the cold air seared the inside of their nostrils When
Orde helped Carroll from beneath the warm buffalo robes she held up to
him a face glowing with colour framed in the soft fluffy fur of a hood

You darling he cried and stooped to kiss her smooth cold cheek

When he had returned from the stable around the corner he found the lit
lamp throwing its modified light and shade over the little round table
He shook down the baseburner vigorously thrust several billets of wood
in its door and turned to meet her eyes across the table

Kind of fun being married isnt it said he

Kind of she admitted nodding gravely

The business of the firm was by now about in shape All the boom
arrangements had been made the two tugs were in the water and their
machinery installed supplies and equipments were stored away the
foremen of the crews engaged and the crews themselves pretty well
picked out Only there needed to build the wanigan and to cart in the
supplies for the upper river works before the spring breakup and the
almost complete disappearance of the roads Therefore Orde had the good
fortune of unusual leisure to enjoy these first months with his
bride They entered together the Unexplored Country and found it more
wonderful than they had dreamed Almost before they knew it January and
February had flown

We must pack up sweetheart said Orde

Its only yesterday that we came she cried regretfully

They took the train for Redding were installed in the gable room
explored together for three days the delights of the oldfashioned
house the spicy joys of Grandma Ordes and Amandas cookery the almost
adoring adulation of the old folks Then Orde packed his turkey
assumed his woods clothes and marched off down the street carrying his
bag on his back

He looks like an old tramp in that rig said Grandma Orde closing the
storm door

He looks like a conqueror of wildernesses cried Carroll straining
her eyes after his vanishing figure Suddenly she darted after him
calling in her high birdlike tones He turned and came back to her
She clasped him by the shoulders reluctant to let him go

Goodbye she said at last Youll take better care of my sweetheart
than you ever did of Jack Orde wont you dear

Orde had reconnoitred the river as a general reconnoitres his
antagonist and had made his dispositions as the general disposes of his
army his commissary his reserves At this point five men could keep
the river clear at that rapid it would require twenty there a dozen
would suffice for ordinary contingencies and yet an emergency might
call for thirtythose thirty must not be beyond reach In his minds
eye he apportioned the sections of the upper river Among the remoter
wildernesses every section must have its driving camp The crews of
each whether few or many would be expected to keep clear and running
their own beats on the river As far as the rear crew should overtake
these divisions either it would absorb them or the members of them
would be thrown forward beyond the lowermost beat to take charge of a
new division down stream When the settled farm country or the little
towns were reached many of the driving camps would become unnecessary
the men could be boarded out at farms lying in their beats A continual
advance would progress toward the Lake the drive crews passing and
repassing each other like pigeons in the sown fields Each of these
sections would be in charge of a foreman whose responsibility ceased
with the delivery of the logs to the men next below A walking boss
would trudge continually the river trail or ride the logs down stream
holding the correlation of these many units Orde himself would drive up
and down the river overseeing the whole plan of campaign throwing the
camps forward concentrating his forces here spreading them elsewhere
keeping accurately in mind the entire situation so that he could say
with full confidence Open Dam Number One for three hours at nine
oclock Dam Number Two for two hours and a half at ten thirty and so
on down the line sure that the flood waters thus released would arrive
at the right moment would supplement each other and would so space
themselves as to accomplish the most work with the least waste In that
one point more than in any other showed the expert The water was his
ammunition a definite and limited quantity of it To get the logs out
with the water was the last word of praise to be said for the river
driver The more logs the greater the glory

Thus it can readily be seen this matter was rather a campaign than a
mere labour requiring the men the munitions the organisation the
tactical ability the strategy the resourcefulness the boldness and
the executive genius of a military commander

To all these things and to the distribution of supplies and implements
among the various camps Orde had attended The wanigan for the rear
crew was built The foremen and walking boss had been picked out
Everything was in readiness Orde was satisfied with the situation
except that he found himself rather shorthanded He had counted on
three hundred men for his crews but scrape and scratch as he would he
was unable to gather over two hundred and fifty This matter was not
so serious however as later when the woods camps should break up he
would be able to pick up more workmen

They wont be rivermen like my old crew though said Orde regretfully
to Tom North the walking boss Id like to steal a few from some of
those Muskegon outfits

Until the logs should be well adrift Orde had resolved to boss the rear
crew himself

As the rear was naturally the farthest up stream Orde had taken also
the contract to break the rollways belonging to Carlin which in the
seasons work would be piled up on the bank Thus he could get to work
immediately at the breakup and without waiting for some one else The
seven or eight million feet of lumber comprised in Carlins drive would
keep the men below busy until the other owners farther down and up the
tributaries should also have put their seasons cut afloat

The ice went out early to Ordes satisfaction As soon as the river
ran clear in its lower reaches he took his rear crew in to Carlins
rollways

This crew was forty in number and had been picked from the besta
hardbitten tough band of veterans weather beaten scarred in numerous
fights or by the backwoods scourge of smallpox compact muscular
fearless loyal cynically aloof from those not of their cult
outspoken and free to criticisein short men to do great things under
the strong leader and to mutiny at the end of three days under the
weak They piled off the train at Sawyers stamped their feet on the
board platform of the station shouldered their turkeys and straggled
off down the toteroad It was an eighteenmile walk in The ground had
loosened its frost The footing was ankledeep in mud and snowwater

Next morning bright and early the breaking of the rollways began
During the winter the logs had been hauled down ice roads to the river
where they were banked in piles twenty and even thirty feet in
height The bed of the stream itself was filled with them for a mile
save in a narrow channel left down through the middle to allow for some
flow of water the banks were piled with them side on ready to roll
down at the urging of the men

First of all the entire crew set itself by means of its peavies to
rolling the lower logs into the current where they were rapidly borne
away As the waters were now at flood this was a quick and easy labour
Occasionally some tiers would be stuck together by ice in which case
considerable prying and heaving was necessary in order to crack them
apart But forty men all busily at work soon had the river full Orde
detailed some six or eight to drop below in order that the river might
run clear to the next section where the next crew would take up the
task These men quite simply walked to the edges of the rollway
rolled a log apiece into the water stepped aboard leaned against their
peavies and were swept away by the swift current The logs on which
they stood whirled in the eddies caromed against other timbers
slackened speed shot away never did the riders alter their poses of
easy equilibrium From time to time one propelled his craft ashore
by hooking to and pushing against other logs There he stood on some
prominent point leaning his chin contemplatively against the thick
shaft of his peavy watching the endless procession of the logs drifting
by Apparently he was idle but in reality his eyes missed no shift of
the ordered ranks When a slight hitch or pause a subtle change in the
pattern of the brown carpet caught his attention he sprang into life
Balancing his peavy across his body he made his way by short dashes
to the point of threatened congestion There working vigorously swept
down stream with the mass he pulled hauled and heaved forcing the
heavy reluctant timbers from the cohesion that threatened trouble
later Oblivious to his surroundings he wrenched and pried desperately
The banks of the river drifted by Point succeeded point as though
withdrawn up stream by some invisible manipulator The river appeared
stationary the banks in motion Finally he heard at his elbow the voice
of the man stationed below him who had run out from his own point

Hullo Bill he replied to this man you old slough hog Tie into
this this

All the time agreed Bill cheerfully

In a few moments the danger was averted the logs ran free The rivermen
thereupon made their uncertain way back to shore where they took the
river trail up stream again to their respective posts

At noon they ate lunches they had brought with them in little canvas
bags snatched before they left the rollways from a supply handy by the
cook In the meantime the main crew were squatting in the lea of the
brush devouring a hot meal which had been carried to them in wooden
boxes strapped to the backs of the chore boys Down the river and up its
tributaries other crews both in the employ of Newmark and Orde and of
others were also pausing from their cold and dangerous toil The river
refreshed after its long winter bent its mighty back to the great
annual burden laid upon it

By the end of the second day the logs actually in the bed of the stream
had been shaken loose and a large proportion of them had floated
entirely from sight It now became necessary to break down the rollways
piled along the tops of the banks

The evening of this day however Orde received a visit from Jim
Denning the foreman of the next section below bringing with him
Charlie the cook of Dalys last years drive Leaving him by the larger
fire Jim Denning drew his principal one side

This fellow drifted in tonight two days late after a drunk and he
tells an almighty queer story said he He says a crew of bad men
from the Saginaw sixty strong have been sent in by Heinzman He says
Heinzman hired them to come over not to work but just to fight and
annoy us

That so said Orde Well where are they

Dont know But he sticks by his story and tells it pretty straight

Bring him over and lets hear it said Orde

Hullo Charlie he greeted the cook when the latter stood before him
Whats this yarn Jims telling me

Its straight Mr Orde said the cook Theres a big crew brought in
from the Saginaw Waters to do you up Theyre supposed to be over here
to run his drive but really theyre goin to fight and raise hell For
why would he want sixty men to break out them little rollways of hisn
up at the headwaters

Is that where theyve gone asked Orde like a flash

Yes sir And he only owns a forty up there and it aint moren half
cut anyway

I didnt know he owned any

Yes sir He bought that little Johnson piece last winter I been
workin up there with a little twohorse crew since January We didnt
put up moren a couple hundred thousand

Is he breaking out his rollways below Orde asked Denning

No sir struck in Charlie he aint

How do you happen to be so wise inquired Orde Seems to me you know
about as much as old man Solomon

Well explained Charlie you see its like this When I got back from
the woods last week I just sort of happened into McNeills place I
wasnt drinkin a drop he cried virtuously in answer to Ordes smile

Of course not said Orde I was just thinking of the last time we
were in there together

Thats just it cried Charlie They was always sore at you about
that Well I was lyin on one of those there benches back of the
Merican flags in the dance hall cause I was very sleepy when in blew
old man Heinzman and McNeill himself I just lay low for black ducks
and heard their talk They took a look around but didnt see no one so
they opened her up wide

What did you hear asked Orde

Well McNeill he agreed to get a gang of bad ones from the Saginaw to
run in on the river and I heard Heinzman tell him to send em in to
headwaters And McNeill said Thats all right about the cash Mr
Heinzman but I been figgerin on gettin even with Orde for some
myself

Is that all inquired Orde

Thats about all confessed Charlie

How do you know he didnt hire them to carry down his drive for him
Hed need sixty men for his lower rollways and maybe they werent all
to go to headwaters asked Orde by way of testing Charlies beliefs

Hes payin them four dollars a day replied Charlie simply Now
whod pay that fer just river work

Orde nodded at Jim Denning

Hold on Charlie said he Why are you giving all this away if you
were working for Heinzman

Im working for you now replied Charlie with dignity And besides
you helped me out once yourself

I guess its a straight tip all right said Orde to Denning when the
cook had resumed his place by the fire

Thats what I thought Thats why I brought him up

If that crews been sent in there it means only one thing at that end
of the line said Orde

Sure Theyre sent up to waste out the water in the reservoir and hang
this end of the drive replied Denning

Correct said Orde The old skunk knows his own rollways are so far
down stream that hes safe flood water or no flood water

A pause ensued during which the two smoked vigorously

What are you going to do about it asked Denning at last

What would you do countered Orde

Well said Denning slowly and with a certain grim joy I dont bet
those Saginaw riverpigs are any more twofisted than the boys on this
river Id go up and clean em out

Wont do negatived Orde briefly In the first place as you know
very well were shorthanded now and we cant spare the men from the
work In the second place wed hang up sure then to go up in that
wilderness fifty miles from civilisation would mean a firstclass row
of too big a size to handle Wont do

Suppose you get a lawyer suggested Denning sarcastically

Orde laughed with great goodhumour

Whered our water be by the time he got an injunction for us

He fell into a brown study during which his pipe went out

Jim he said finally it isnt a fair game I dont know what to do
Delay will hang us taking men off the work will hang us Ive just got
to go up there myself and see what can be done by talking to them

Talking to them Denning snorted You might as well whistle down the
draughtpipe of hell If theyre just up there for a row therell be
whisky in camp and you can bet McNeills got some of em instructed on
YOUR account Theyll kill you sure

I agree with you its risky replied Orde Im scared Im willing to
admit it But I dont see what else to do Of course hes got no rights
but what the hell good does that do us after our water is gone And Jim
my son if we hang this drive Ill be buried so deep I never will dig
out No Ive got to go You can stay up here in charge of the rear
until I get back Send word by Charlie whos to boss your division while
youre gone




XXIII


Orde tramped back to Sawyers early next morning hitched into the light
buckboard the excellent team with which later when the drive should
spread out he would make his longest jumps and drove to headwaters
He arrived in sight of the dam about three oclock At the edge of the
clearing he pulled up to survey the scene

A group of three small logcabins marked the Johnson and later the
Heinzman camp From the chimneys a smoke arose Twenty or thirty
rivermen lounged about the sunny side of the largest structure They
had evidently just arrived for some of their turkeys were still piled
outside the door Orde clucked to his horses and the spidery wheels of
the buckboard swung lightly over the wet hummocks of the clearing to
come to a stop opposite the men Orde leaned forward against his knees

Hullo boys said he cheerfully

No one replied though two or three nodded surlily Orde looked them
over with some interest

They were a dirty unkempt unshaven hardlooking lot with bloodshot
eyes a flicker of the daredevil in expression beyond the first youth
hardened into an enduring toughness of fibrebad men from the Saginaw
in truth and unless Orde was mistaken men just off a drunk and
therefore especially dangerous men eager to fight at the drop of
the hat or sooner to be accommodating and ready to employ in
their assaults all the formidable and terrifying weapons of the
roughandtumble reckless hard irreverrent blasphemous to be gained
over by no words fair or foul absolutely scornful of any and all
institutions imposed on them by any other but the few men whom they
acknowledged as their leaders And to master these mens respect
there needed either superlative strength superlative recklessness or
superlative skill

Whos your boss asked Orde

The Rough Red growled one of the men without moving

Orde had heard of this man of his personality and his deeds Like
Silver Jack of the Muskegon his exploits had been celebrated in song A
big broadfaced man with a red beard they had told him with little
flickering eyes a huge voice that bellowed through the woods in a
torrent of commands and imprecations strong as a bull and savage as
a wild beast A hint of his quality will suffice from the many stories
circulated about him It was said that while jobbing for Morrison and
Daly in some of that firms Saginaw Valley holdings the Rough Red had
discovered that a horse had gone lame He called the driver of that team
before him seized an iron starting bar and with it broke the mans
leg Try th lameness yourself Barney Mallan said he To appeal to
the charity of such a man would be utterly useless Orde saw this point
He picked up his reins and spoke to his team

But before the horses had taken three steps a huge riverman had planted
himself squarely in the way The others rising slowly surrounded the
rig

I dont know what youre up here for growled the man at the horses
heads but you wanted to see the boss and I guess youd better see
him

I intend to see him said Orde sharply Get out of the way and let me
hitch my team

He drove deliberately ahead forcing the man to step aside and stopped
his horses by a stub He tied them there and descended to lean his back
also against the log walls of the little house

After a few moments a huge form appeared above the river bank at some
forty rods distance

Yonder he comes now vouchsafed the man nearest Orde

Orde made out the great square figure of the boss his soft hat his
flaming red beard his dingy mackinaw coat his dingy blackandwhite
checked flannel shirt his dingy blue trousers tucked into high socks
and instead of driving boots his ordinary lumbermans rubbers As a
spot of colour he wore a flaming red knit sash with tassels Before
he had approached near enough to be plainly distinguishable he began
to bellow at the men commanding them with a mighty array of oaths
to wake up and get the sluicegate open In a moment or so he had
disappeared behind some bushes that intervened in his approach to the
house His course through them could be traced by the top of his cap
which just showed above them In a moment he thrust through the brush
and stood before Orde

For a moment he stared at the young man and then with a wild Irish
yell leaped upon him Orde caught unawares and in an awkward position
was hardly able even to struggle against the gigantic riverman
Indeed before he had recovered his faculties to the point of offering
determined resistance he was pinned back against the wall by his
shoulders and the Rough Reds face was within two feet of his own

And how are ye ye ould darlint shouted the latter with a roll of
oaths

Why Jimmy Bourke cried Orde and burst into a laugh

The Rough Red jerked him to his feet delivered a bear hug that nearly
crushed his ribs and pounded him mightily on the back

You ould snoozer he bellowed Where the blankety blank in blank did
you come from Byes he shouted to the men its me ould boss on th
Au Sable six year backthat time ye mind whin we had th ice jam
Glory be but Im glad to see ye

Orde was still laughing

I didnt know youd turned into the Rough Red Jimmy said he I
dont believe we were either of us old enough for whiskers then were
we

The Rough Red grinned

Thrue for ye said he And what have ye been doing all these years

Thats just it Jimmy said Orde drawing the giant one side out of
earshot All my eggs are in one basket and its a mean trick of you
to hire out for filthy lucre to kick that basket

What do ye mane asked the Rough Red fixing his twinkling little eyes
on Orde

You dont mean to tell me countered Orde glancing down at the
others rubbershod feet that this crew has been sent up here just to
break out those measly little rollways

Thim said the Rough Red Thim Hell NO Thims my bodyguard They
can lick their weight in wild cats and Id loike well to see the gang
of highbankers that infists this river thry to pry thim out We werent
sint here to wurrk we were sint here to foight

Fight Why asked Orde

Oh I dunno replied the Rough Red easily Me boss and the blank of a
blank blanked blank thats attimptin to droive this river has some sort
of a row

Jimmy said Orde didnt you know that I am the gentleman last
mentioned

What

Im driving this river and thats my damkeeper youve got hid away
somewhere here and thats my water youre planning to waste

What repeated the Rough Red but in a different tone of voice

Thats right said Orde

In a tone of vast astonishment the Rough Red mentioned his probable
deserts in the future life

Luk here Jack said he after a moment heres a crew of whitewater
birlers that ye cant beat nowheres What do you want us to do Were
now gettin four dollars a day AN board from that murderin ould
villain Heinzman SO WE CAN AFFORD TO WURRK FOR YOU CHEAP

Orde hesitated

Oh please do now darlint wheedled the Rough Red his little eyes
agleam with mischief Sind us some oakum and pitch and well caulk yure
wanigan for ye Or maybe some more peavies and well hilp ye on yure
rollways And till us afore ye go how ye want this dam and thats the
way shell be Come now dear and aint ye shorthanded now

Orde slapped his knee and laughed

This is sure one hell of a joke he cried

And aint it now said the Rough Red smiling with as much
ingratiation as he was able

Ill take you boys on said Orde at last at the usual wagesdollar
and a half for the jam three for the rear I doubt if youll see much
of Heinzmans money when this leaks out

Thus Orde by the sheer good luck that sometimes favours men engaged in
large enterprises not only frustrated a plan likely to bring failure to
his interests but filled up his crews It may be remarked here as well
as later that the terrors of the Saginaw stayed with the drive to
its finish and proved reliable and tractable in every particular Orde
scattered them judiciously so there was no friction with the local men
The Rough Red he retained on the rear

Here the breaking of the rollways had reached a stage more exciting both
to onlooker and participant than the mere opening of the river channel
Huge stacks of logs piled sidewise to the bank lined the stream for
miles When the lowermost log on the river side was teased and pried
out the upper tiers were apt to cascade down with a roar a crash and
a splash The man who had done the prying had to be very quickeyed
very cool and very agile to avoid being buried under the tons of timber
that rushed down on him Only the most reliable men were permitted at
this initial breaking down Afterwards the crew rolled in what logs
remained

The Rough Reds enormous strength daredevil spirit and nimbleness of
body made him invaluable at this dangerous work Orde too often took a
hand in some of the more ticklish situations In old days before he
had attained the position of responsibility that raised the value of his
time beyond manual work he had been one of the best men on the river at
breaking bank rollways A slim graceful handsome boy of twenty known
as Rollway Charlie also distinguished himself by the quickness and
certainty of his work Often the men standing near lost sight of him
entirely in the spray the confusion the blur of the breaking rollways
until it seemed certain he must have perished Nevertheless always he
appeared at right or left sometimes even on a log astream nonchalant
smiling escaped easily from the destructive power he had loosed Once
in the stream the logs ran their appointed course watched by the men
who herded them on their way And below from the tributaries from the
other rollways a neverending procession of recruits joined this great
brown army on its way to the lake until for miles and miles the river
was almost a solid mass of logs

The crews on the various beats now had their hands full to keep the logs
running The slightest check at any one point meant a jam for there
was no way of stopping the unending procession The logs behind
floated gently against the obstruction and came to rest The brown mass
thickened As far as the eye could reach the surface of the water was
concealed And then as the slow pressure developed from the three
or four miles of logs forced against each other by the pushing of the
current the breast of the jam began to rise Timbers upended crossed
interlocked slid one over the other mounted higher and higher in the
formidable game of jackstraws the loss of which spelled death to the
players

Immediately and with feverish activity the men nearest at hand
attacked the work Logs on top they tumbled and rolled into the current
below Men beneath the breast tugged and pried in search of the key logs
causing all the trouble Others flattened out the wings hoping to get
a draw around the ends As the stoppage of the drive indicated to
the men up and down stream that a jam had formed they gathered at the
scenethose from above over the logs those from below up the river
trail

Rarely unless in case of unusual complications did it take more than
a few hours at most to break the jam The breast of it went out with a
rush More slowly the wings sucked in Reluctantly the mass floating on
the surface for miles up stream stirred silently moved forward For a
few minutes it was necessary to watch carefully until the flow onward
steadied itself until the congestion had spaced and ordered as before
Then the men moved back to their posts the drive was resumed At night
the river was necessarily left to its own devices Rivermen with the
touch of superstition inseparably connected with such affairs believe
implicitly that logs run free at night Certainly though it might
be expected that each morning would reveal a big jam to break such was
rarely the case The logs had usually stopped to be sure but generally
in so peaceful a situation as easily to be started on by a few minutes
work Probably this was because they tended to come to rest in the slow
still reaches of the river through which in daytime they would be
urged by the rivermen

Jams on the river contrary to general belief are of very common
occurrence Throughout the length of the drive there were probably
three or four hangups a day Each of these had to be broken and in the
breaking was danger The smallest misstep the least slowness in reading
the signs of the break the slightest lack of promptness in acting on
the hint or of agility in leaping from one to the other of the plunging
timbers the faintest flicker from rigid attention to the antagonist
crouching on the spring would mean instant death to the delinquent
Thus it was literally true that each one of these men was called upon
almost daily to wager his personal skill against his destruction

In the meantime the rear was sacking its way as fast as possible
moving camp with the wanigan whenever necessary working very hard and
very cold and very long In its work however beyond the breaking of
the rollways was little of the spectacular

Orde after the rear was well started patrolled the length of the
drive in his light buckboard He had a firstclass team of young
horseshighspirited somewhat fractious but capable on a pinch
of their hundred miles in a day He handled them well over the rough
corduroys and swamp roads From jam to rear and back again he travelled
pausing on the river banks to converse earnestly with one of the
foremen surveying the situation with the birdseye view of the
general At times he remained at one camp for several days watching the
trend of the work The improvements made during the preceding summer
gave him the greatest satisfaction especially the apron at the falls

Wed have had a dozen bad jams here before now with all these logs in
the river said he to Tim Nolan who was in charge of that beat

And as it is said Tim weve had but the one little wing jam

The piers to define the channel along certain shallows also saved the
rear crew much labour in the matter of stranded logs Everything was
very satisfactory Even old man Reed held to his chastened attitude
and made no trouble In fact he seemed glad to turn an honest penny by
boarding the small crew in charge of sluicing the logs

No trouble was experienced until Heinzmans rollways were reached
Here Orde had as he had promised his partner boomed a free channel to
prevent Heinzman from filling up the entire riverbed with his rollways
When the jam of the drive had descended the river as far as this Orde
found that Heinzman had not yet begun to break out Hardly had Ordes
first crew passed however when Heinzmans men began to break down the
logs into the drive Long before the rear had caught up all Heinzmans
drive was in the water inextricably mingled with the sixty or eighty
million feet Orde had in charge

The situation was plain All Heinzman now had to do was to retain a
small crew which should follow after the rear in order to sack what
logs the latter should leave stranded This amounted practically to
nothing As it was impossible in so great a mass of timbers and in the
haste of a pressing labour to distinguish or discriminate against
any single brand Heinzman was in a fair way to get his logs sent down
stream with practically no expense

Vell my boy remarked the German quite frankly to Orde as they met on
the road one day looks like I got you dis time eh

Orde laughed also with entire goodhumour

If you mean your logs are going down with ours why I guess you have
But you paste this in your hat youre going to keep awful busy and
its going to cost you something yet to get em down

To Newmark on one of his occasional visits to the camps Orde detailed
the situation

It doesnt amount to much said he except that it complicates
matters Well make him scratch gravel if we have to sit up nights and
work overtime to do it We cant injure him or leave his logs but we
can annoy him a lot

The state of affairs was perfectly well known to the men and the entire
river entered into the spirit of the contest The drivers kept a sharp
lookout for H logs and whenever possible thrust them aside into
eddies and backwaters This of course merely made work for the sackers
Heinzman had left above the rear Soon they were in charge of a very
fair little drive of their own Their lot was not enviable Indeed only
the pressure of work prevented some of the more aggressive of Ordes
rearamong whom could be numbered the Rough Redfrom going back and
cleaning out this impertinent band of hangerson One day two of the
latter conducting the jam of the miniature drive astern came within
reach of the Rough Red The latter had lingered in hopes of rescuing his
peavy which had gone overboard To lose ones peavy is among rivermen
the most mortifying disgrace Consequently the Rough Red was in a fit
mood for trouble He attacked the two singlehanded A desperate battle
ensued which lasted upward of an hour The two rivermen punched
kicked and battered the Rough Red in a manner to tear his clothes
deprive him to some extent of red whiskers bloody his face cut his
shoulder and knock loose two teeth The Rough Red more than the equal
of either man singly had reciprocated in kind Orde driving in toward
the rear from a detour to avoid a swamp heard and descended from his
buckboard Tying his horses to trees he made his way through the brush
to the scene of conflict So winded and wearied were the belligerents
by now that he had no difficulty in separating them He surveyed their
wrecks with a sardonic half smile

I call this a draw said he finally His attitude became threatening
as the two upriver men recovering somewhat showed ugly symptoms
Git he commanded Scat I guess you dont know me Im Jack Orde
Jimmy and I together could do a dozen of you He menaced them until
muttering they had turned away

Well Jimmy said he humorously you look as if youd been run
through a thrashing machine

Those fellers make me sick growled the Rough Red

Orde looked him over again

You look sick said he

When the buckboard drew into camp Orde sent Bourke away to repair
damages while he called the cookee to help unpack several heavy boxes
of hardware They proved to contain about thirty small hatchets well
sharpened and each with a leather guard When the rear crew had come in
that night Orde distributed the hatchets

Boys said he while youre on the work I want you all to keep a
watchout for these H logs and whenever you strike one I want you to
blaze it plainly so there wont be any mistake about it

What for asked one of the Saginaw men as he received his hatchet

But the riverman who squatted next nudged him with his elbow

The less questions you ask Jack the more answers youll get Just do
what youre told to on this river and youll see fun sure

Three days later the rear crew ran into the head of the pond above
Reeds dam To every ones surprise Orde called a halt on the work and
announced a holiday

Now holidays are unknown on drive Barely is time allowed for eating
and sleeping Nevertheless all that day the men lay about in complete
idleness smoking talking sleeping in the warm sun The river
silenced by the closed sluicegates slept also The pond filled with
logs From above the current aided by a fair wind was driving down
still other logsthe forerunners of the little drive astern At sight
of these some of the men grumbled Were losin what we made said
they We left them logs and sorted em out once already

Orde sent a couple of axemen to blaze the newcomers A little before
sundown he ordered the sluicegates of the dam opened

Night work said the men to one another They knew of course that
in sluicing logs the gate must be open a couple of hours before the
sluicing begins in order to fill the riverbed below Logs run ahead
faster than the water spreads

Sure enough after supper Orde suddenly appeared among them the
wellknown devil of mischief dancing in his eyes and broadening his
goodnatured face

Get organised boys said he briskly Weve got to get this pond all
sluiced before morning and theres enough of us here to hustle it right
along

The men took their places Orde moved here and there giving his
directions

Sluice through everything but the H logs he commanded Work them
off to the left and leave them

Twilight then dark fell After a few moments the moon then just past
its full rose behind the newbudding trees The sluicing under the
impetus of a big crew went rapidly

I bet theres mighty near a million an hour going through there
speculated Orde watching the smooth swift but burdened waters of the
chute

And in this work the men distinguished easily the new white blazemarks
on Heinzmans logs so they were able without hesitation to shunt them
one side into the smoother water as Orde had commanded

About two oclock the last log shot through

Now boys said Orde tear out the booms

The chute to the dam was approached as has been earlier explained by
two rows of booms arranged in a V or funnel the apex of which emptied
into the sluiceway and the wide projecting arms of which embraced
the width of the stream The logs floating down the pond were thus
concentrated toward the sluice Also the rivermen walking back and
forth the length of the booms were able easily to keep the drive
moving

Now however Orde unchained these boom logs The men pushed them
ashore There as many as could find room on either side the boompoles
clamped in their peavies and using these implements as handles
carried the booms some distance back into the woods Then everybody
tramped back and forth round and about to confuse the trail Orde was
like a mischievous boy at a school prank When the last timber had been
concealed he lifted up his deep voice in a roar of joy in which the
crew joined

Now lets turn in for a little sleep said be

This situation perhaps a little cloudy in the readers mind would
have cleared could he have looked out over the dam pond the following
morning The blazed logs belonging to Heinzman drifting slowly had
sucked down into the corner toward the power canal where caught against
the grating they had jammed These logs would have to be floated
singly and pushed one by one against the current across the pond and
into the influence of the sluicegate Some of them would be hard to
come at

I guess that will keep them busy for a day or two commented Orde as
he followed the rear down to where it was sacking below the dam

This as Orde had said would be sufficiently annoying to Heinzman
but would have little real effect on the main issue which was that the
German was getting down his logs with a crew of less than a dozen men
Nevertheless Orde in a vast spirit of fun took delight in inventing
and executing practical jokes of the general sort just described For
instance at one spot where he had boomed the deeper channel from the
rocks on either side he shunted as many of Heinzmans logs as came by
handily through an opening he had made in the booms There they grounded
on the shallowsmore work for the men following Many of the logs in
charge of the latter however catching the free current overtook the
rear so that the number of the H logs in the drive was not materially
diminished

At first as has been hinted these various tactics had little effect
One day however the chore boy who had been over to Spruce Rapids
after mail reported that an additional crew of twenty had been sent in
to Heinzmans drive This was gratifying

Were making him scratch gravel boys anyway said Orde

The men entered into the spirit of the thing In fact their enthusiasm
was almost too exuberant Orde had constantly to negative new and
ingenious schemes

No boys said he I want to keep on the right side of the law We
may need it later

Meanwhile the entire length of the river was busy and excited
Heinzmans logs were all blazed inside a week The men passed the
hatchets along the line and slim chance did a marked log have of
rescue once the poor thing fell into difficulties With the strange
and interesting tendency rivermen and woodsmen have of personifying the
elements of their daily work the men addressed the helpless timbers in
tones of contempt

Thought youd ride that rock you    said they and got
left did you Well lie there and be  to you

And if chance offered and time was not pressing the riverman would
give his helpless victim a jerk or so into a more difficult position
Times of rising waterwhen the sluicegates above had been openedwere
the most prolific of opportunities Logs rarely jam on rising water
for the simple reason that constantly the surface area of the river
is increasing thus tending to separate the logs On the other hand
falling water tending to crowd the drive closer together is especially
prolific of trouble Therefore on flood water the watchers scattered
along the stretches of the river had little to dosave strand
Heinzmans logs for him And when flood water had passed some of those
logs were certainly high and dry

Up to a certain point this was all very well Orde took pains not to
countenance it officially and caused word to be passed about that
while he did not expect his men to help drive Heinzmans logs they must
not go out of their way to strand them

If things get too bad hell have spies down here to collect evidence
on us said Orde and hell jug some of us for interference with his
property We dont own the river

How about them booms asked the Rough Red

I did own them explained Orde and I had a right to take them up
when I had finished with them

This hint was enough The men did not cease from a labour that tickled
them mightily but they adopted a code of signals Strangers were not
uncommon Spectators came out often from the little towns and from
the farms roundabout When one of these appeared the riverman nearest
raised a long falsetto cry This was taken up by his next neighbour and
passed on In a few minutes all that section of the drive knew that it
would be wise to lie low And inside of two weeks Orde had the great
satisfaction of learning that Heinzman was workingand working harda
crew of fifty men

A pretty fair crew even if he was taking out his whole drive
commented Orde

The gods of luck seemed to be with the new enterprise Although Orde
had of course taken the utmost pains to foresee every contingency
possible to guard against nevertheless as always when dealing with
Natures larger forces he anticipated some of those gigantic obstacles
which continually render uncertain wilderness work Nothing of the kind
happened There formed none of the tremendous whitewater jams that pile
up several million feet of logs tax every resource of men horses and
explosives and require a week or so to break No men were killed and
only two injured No unexpected floods swept away works on which the
drive depended The water held out to carry the last stick of timber
over the shallowest rapids Weather conditions were phenomenaland
perfect All up and down the river the work went with that vim and dash
that is in itself an assurance of success The Heinzman affair which
under auspices of evil augury might have become a serious menace to the
success of the young undertaking now served merely to add a spice
of humour to the situation Among the men gained currency a
halfaffectionate belief in Ordes luck

After this happy fashion the drive went until at last it entered the
broad deep and navigable stretches of the river from Redding to the
lake Here barring the accident of an extraordinary flood the troubles
were over On the broad placid bosom of the stream the logs would
float A crew following would do the easy work of sacking what logs
would strand or eddy in the lazy current would roll into the faster
waters the component parts of what were by courtesy called jams but
which were in reality pileups of a few hundred logs on sand bars
midstream and in the growing tepid warmth of summer would tramp
pleasantly along the river trail Of course a dry year would make
necessary a larger crew and more labour of course a big flood might
sweep the logs past all defences into the lake for an irretrievable
loss But such floods come once in a century and even the dryest of dry
years could not now hang the drive As Orde sat in his buckboard ready
to go into town for a first glimpse of Carroll in more than two months
he gazed with an immense satisfaction over the broad river moving brown
and glacierlike as though the logs that covered it were viscid and
composed all its substance The enterprise was practically assured of
success

For a while now Orde was to have a breathing spell A large number
of men were here laid off The remainder under the direction of Jim
Denning would require little or no actual supervision Until the jam
should have reached the distributing booms above Monrovia the affair
was very simple Before he left however he called Denning to him

Jim said he Ill be down to see you through the sluiceways at
Redding of course But now that you have a good still stretch of
river I want you to have the boys let up on sacking out those H logs
And I want you to include in our drive all the Heinzman logs from above
you possibly can If you can fix it let their drive drift down into
ours

Then well have to drive their logs for them objected Denning

Sure rejoined Orde but its easy driving and if that crew of his
hasnt much to do perhaps hell lay most of them off here at Redding

Denning looked at his principal for a moment then a slow grin
overspread his face Without comment he turned back to camp and Orde
took up his reins




XXV


Oh Im so GLAD to get you back cried Carroll over and over again
as she clung to him I dont live while youre away And every drop of
rain that patters on the roof chills my heart because I think of it as
chilling you and every creak of this old house at night brings me
up broad awake because I hear in it the crash of those cruel great
timbers Oh oh OH Im so glad to get you Youre the light of my
life youre my whole life itselfshe smiled at him from her perch on
his kneeIm silly am I not she said Dear heart dont leave me
again

Ive got to support an extravagant wife you know Orde reminded her
gravely

I know of course she breathed bending lightly to him You have
your work in the world to do and I would not have it otherwise It is
great workwonderful workIve been asking questions

Orde laughed

Its work just like any other And its hard work said he

She shook her head at him slowly a mysterious smile on her lips
Without explaining her thought she slipped from his knee and glided
across to the tall golden harp which had been brought from Monrovia
The light and diaphanous silk of her loose peignoir floated about her
defining the maturing grace of her figure Abruptly she struck a great
crashing chord

Then with an abandon of ecstasy she plunged into one of those wild and
seablown sagalike rhapsodies of the Hungarians full of the wind in
rigging the storm in the pines of shrieking vast forces hurtling
unchained through a resounding and infinite space as though deep down
in primeval nature the powers of the world had been loosed Back and
forth here and there erratic and swift and sudden as lightning the
theme played breathless It fell

What is that gasped Orde surprised to find himself tense his blood
rioting his soul stirred

She ran to him to hide her face in his neck

Oh its you you you she cried

He held her to him closely until her excitement had died

Do you think it is good to get quite so nervous sweetheart he asked
gently then Remember

Oh I do I do she broke in earnestly Every moment of my waking and
sleeping hours I remember him Always I keep his little soul before me
as a light on a shrine But tonightoh tonight I could laugh and
shout aloud like the people in the Bible with clapping of hands She
snuggled herself close to Orde with a little murmur of happiness I
think of all the beautiful things she whispered and of the noble
things and of the great things He is going to be sturdy like his
father a wonderful boy a boy all of fire

Like his mother said Orde

She smiled up at him I want him just like you dear she pleaded

Three days later the jam of the drive reached the dam at Redding
Orde took Carroll downtown in the buckboard There a seat by the
damwatchers little house was given her back of the brick factory
buildings next the power canal whence for hours she watched the slow
onward movement of the sullen brown timbers the smooth polishedsteel
rush of the waters through the chute the graceful certain movements of
the rivermen Some of the latter were brought up by Orde and introduced
They were very awkward and somewhat embarrassed but they all looked
her straight in the eye and Carroll felt somehow that back of their
diffidence they were quite dispassionately appraising her After a few
gracious speeches on her part and monosyllabic responses on theirs they
blundered away In spite of the scant communication these interviews
left something of a friendly feeling on both sides

I like your Jim Denning she told Orde hes a nice cleancut
fellow And Mr Bourke she laughed Isnt he funny with his fierce
red beard and his little eyes But he simply adores you

Orde laughed at the idea of the Rough Reds adoring anybody

Its so she insisted and I like him for itonly I wish he were a
little cleaner

She thought the feats of logriding little less than wonderful
and you may be sure the knowledge of her presence did not discourage
spectacular display Finally Johnny Challan uttering a loud whoop
leaped aboard a log and went through the chute standing bolt upright By
a marvel of agility he kept his balance through the whitewater below
and emerged finally into the lower waters still proudly upright and dry
above the knees

Carroll had arisen the better to see

Why she cried aloud its marvellous Circus riding is nothing to
it

No maam replied a gigantic riverman who was working near at hand
that aint nothin Ordinary however we travel that way on the river
At night we have the cookee pass us out each a goosehar piller and
lay down for the night

Carroll looked at him in reproof He grinned slowly

Dont git worried about me maam said he Im hopeless For
twenty year now I been wearin crape on my hat in memory of my departed
virtues

After the rear had dropped down river from Redding Carroll and Orde
returned to their deserted little box of a house at Monrovia

Orde breathed deep of a new satisfaction in walking again the streets of
this little sandy sawdustpaved shantyfied town with its yellow hills
and its wide blue river and its glimpse of the lake far in the offing
It had never meant anything to him before Now he enjoyed every brick
and board of it he trod the broken aromatic shingles of the roadway
with pleasure he tramped up the broad stairs and down the dark hall of
the block with anticipation he breathed the compounded office odour
of ledgers cocoa matting and old cigar smoke in a long reminiscent
whiff he took his seat at his rolltop desk enchanted to be again in
these homely though familiar surroundings

Hanged if I know whats struck me he mused Never experienced any
remarkable joy before in getting back to this sort of truck

Then with a warm glow at the heart the realisation was brought to him
This was home and over yonder under the shadow of the heavenpointing
spire a slip of a girl was waiting for him

He tried to tell her this when next he saw her

I felt that I ought to make you a little shrine and burn candles to
you the way the Catholics do

To the Mater Dolorosa she mocked

He looked at her dark eyes so full of the sweetness of content at her
sensitive lips with the quaintly upturned corners and he thought of
what her home life had been and of the real sorrow that even yet must
smoulder somewhere down in the deeps of her being

No said he slowly not that I think my shrine will be dedicated to
Our Lady of the Joyous Soul

The rest of the week Orde was absent up the river superintending in a
general way the latter progress of the drive looking into the needs
of the crews arranging for supplies The mills were all working now
busily cutting into the residue of last seasons logs Soon they would
need more

At the booms everything was in readiness to receive the jam The long
swing arm slanting across the river channel was attached to its winch
which would operate it When shut it would close the main channel and
shunt into the booms the logs floating in the river There penned at
last by the piles driven in a row and held together at the top by bolted
timbers they would lie quiet Men armed with pikepoles would then take
up the work of distribution according to the brands stamped on the ends
Each brand had its own separate sorting pens the lower end leading
again into the open river From these each owners property was rafted
and towed to his private booms at his mill below

Orde spent the day before the jam appeared in constructing what he
called a boomerang

Invention of my own he explained to Newmark Secret invention just
yet Im going to hold up the drive in the main river until we have
things bunched then Im going to throw a big crew down here by the
swing Heinzman anticipates of course that Ill run the entire drive
into the booms and do all my sorting there Naturally if I turn his
logs loose into the river as fast as I run across them he will be able
to pick them up one at a time for hell only get them occasionally If
I keep them until everything else is sorted only Heinzmans logs will
remain and as we have no right to hold logs well have to turn them
loose through the lower sorting booms where he can be ready to raft
them In that way he gets them all right without paying us a cent See

Yes I see said Newmark

Well said Orde with a laugh here is where I fool him Im going
to rush the drive into the booms all at once but Im going to sort out
Heinzmans logs at these openings near the entrance and turn them into
the main channel

What good will that do asked Newmark sceptically He gets them
sorted just the same doesnt he

The currents fairly strong Orde pointed out and the rivers
almighty wide When you spring seven or eight million feet on a man all
at once and unexpected and he with no crew to handle them hes going
to keep almighty busy And if he dont stop them this side his mill
hell have to raft and tow them back and if he dont stop em this side
the lake he may as well kiss them all good byeexcept those that drift
into the bayous and inlets and marshes and other ungodly places

I see said Newmark drily

But dont say a word anywhere warned Orde Secrecy is the watchword
of success with this merry little joke

The boomerang worked like a charm The men had been grumbling at an
apparently peaceful yielding of the point at issue and would have
sacked out many of the blazed logs if Orde had not held them rigidly
to it Now their spirits flamed into joy again The sorting went like
clockwork Orde in personal charge watched that through the different
openings in his boomerang the H logs were shunted into the river
Shortly the channel was full of logs floating merrily away down the
little blue wavelets After a while Orde handed over his job to Tom
North

Cant stand it any longer boys said he Ive got to go down and see
how the Dutchman is making it

Come back and tell us yelled one of the crew

You bet I will Orde shouted back

He drove the team and buckboard down the marsh road to Heinzmans mill
There he found evidences of the wildest excitement The mill had been
closed down and all the men turned in to rescue logs Boats plied in
all directions A tug darted back and forth Constantly the number of
floating logs augmented however Many had already gone by

If you think youre busy now said Orde to himself with a chuckle
just wait until you begin to get LOGS

He watched for a few moments in silence

Whats he doing with that tug thought he Oho Hes stringing booms
across the river to hold the whole outfit

He laughed aloud turned his team about and drove frantically back to
the booms Every few moments he chuckled His eyes danced Hardly could
he wait to get there Once at the camp he leaped from the buckboard
with a shout to the stableman and ran rapidly out over the booms to
where the sorting of H logs was going merrily forward

Hes shut down his mill shouted Orde and hes got all that gang of
highbankers out and every old rumblossom in Monrovia and I bet if you
say logs to him hed chase his tail in circles

Want this job North asked him

No said Orde suddenly fallen solemn havent time Im going to
take Marsh and the SPRITE and go to town Old Heinzman he added as
an afterthought is stringing booms across the riverobstructing
navigation

He ran down the length of the whole boom to where lay the two tugs

Marsh he called when still some distance away got up steam

There appeared a short square blueclad man with hard brown cheeks
a heavy bleached flaxen moustache and eyes steady unwavering and as
blue as the sky

Up in two minutes he answered and descended from the pilot house to
shout down a low door leading from the deck into the engine room

Harvey he commanded fire her up

A tall goodnatured negro reached the upper half of his body from the
low door to seize an armful of the slabs piled along the narrow deck
Ten minutes later the SPRITE a cloud of white smoke pouring from her
funnel was careening down the stretch of the river

Captain Marsh guided his energetic charge among the logs floating in the
stream with the marvellous second instinct of the expert tugboat man
A whirl of the wheel to the right a turn to the leftthe craft
heeled strongly under the forcing of her powerful rudder to avoid by
an armslength some timbers fairly flung aside by the wash The
displacement of the rapid running seemed almost to press the water
above the level of the deck on either side and about ten feet from the
gunwale As the low marshes and cattails flew past Orde noted with
satisfaction that many of the logs urged one side by the breeze had
found lodgment among the reeds and in the bayous and inlets One at a
time and painfully these would have to be salvaged

In a short time the mills tall smokestacks loomed in sight The logs
thickened until it was with difficulty that Captain Marsh could thread
his way among them at all Shortly Orde standing by the wheel in the
pilothouse could see down the stretches of the river a crowd of men
working antlike

Theyve got em stopped commented Orde Look at that gang working
from boats They havent a dozen cork boots among em

What do you want me to do asked Captain Marsh

This is a navigable river isnt it replied Orde Run through

Marsh rang for halfspeed and began to nose his way gently through the
loosely floating logs Soon the tug had reached the scene of activity
and headed straight for the slender line of booms hitched end to end and
stretching quite across the river

Im afraid well just ride over them if we hit them too slow
suggested Marsh

Orde looked at his watch

Well be late for the mail unless we hurry said he Marsh whirled
the spokes of his wheel over and rang the engineroom bell The water
churned white behind the tug careened

Vat you do Stop cried Heinzman from one of the boats

Orde stuck his head from the pilothouse door

Youre obstructing navigation he yelled Ive got to go to town to
buy a postagestamp

The prow of the tug accurately aimed by Marsh hit square in the
junction of two of the booms Immediately the water was agitated on both
sides and for a hundred feet or so by the pressure of the long poles
sidewise There ensued a moment of strain then the links snapped and
the SPRITE plunged joyously through the opening The booms swept aside
by the current floated to either shore The river was open

Orde his head still out the door looked back Slow down Marsh said
he Lets see the show Already the logs caught by the booms had taken
their motion and had swept past the opening Although the lonesome tug
Heinzman had on the work immediately picked up one end of the broken
boom and with it started out into the river she found difficulty in
making headway against the sweep of the logs After a long struggle she
reached the middle of the river where she was able to hold her own

Wonder what next speculated Orde How are they going to get the
other end of the booms out from the other bank

Captain Marsh had reversed the SPRITE The tug lay nearly motionless
amidstream her propeller slowly revolving

Up river all the small boats gathered in a line connected one to the
other by a rope The tug passed over to them the cable attached to the
boom Evidently the combined efforts of the rowboats were counted on
to hold the halfboom across the current while the tug brought out the
other half When the tug dropped the cable Orde laughed

Nobody but a Dutchman would have thought of that he cried Now for
the fun

Immediately the weight fell on the small boats they were dragged
irresistibly backward Even from a distance the three men on the SPRITE
could make out the whitewater as the oars splashed and churned and
frantically caught crabs in a vain effort to hold their own Marsh
lowered his telescope the tears streaming down his face

Its better than a goat fight said he

Futilely protesting the rowboats were dragged backward turned as a
whip is snapped and strung out along the bank below

Theyll have to have two tugs before they can close the break that
way commented Orde

Sure thing replied Captain Marsh

But at that moment a black smoke rolled up over the marshes and shortly
around the bend from above came the LUCY BELLE

The LUCY BELLE was the main excuse for calling the river navigable She
made trips as often as she could between Redding and Monrovia In luck
she could cover the forty miles in a day It was no unusual thing
however for the LUCY BELLE to hang up indefinitely on some one of
the numerous shifting sand bars For that reason she carried more
imperishable freight than passengers In appearance she was
twostoried with twin smokestacks an iron Indian on her top and a
splutterbehind paddlewheel

There comes his help said Orde Old Simpson would stop to pick up a
bogus threecent piece

Sure enough on hail from one of the rowboats the LUCY BELLE slowed
down and stopped After a short conference she steamed clumsily over to
get hold of one end of the booms The tug took the other In time and
by dint of much splashing some collisions and several attempts the
ends of the booms were united

By this time however nearly all the logs had escaped The tug towing
a string of rowboats set out in pursuit

The SPRITE continued on her way until beyond sight Then she slowed down
again The LUCY BELLE churned around the bend and turned in toward the
tug

Shes going to speak us marvelled Orde I wonder what the dickens
she wants

Tug ahoy bellowed a redfaced individual from the upper deck He was
dressed in blue and brass buttons carried a telescope in one hand and
was liberally festooned with gold braid and embroidered anchors

Answer him Orde commanded Marsh

Hullo there commodore what is it replied the tug captain

The redfaced figure glared down for a moment

They want a tug up there at Heinzmans Can you go

Sure cried Marsh choking

The LUCY BELLE sheered off magnificently

What do you think of that Marsh asked Orde

The commodore always acts as if that old raft was a sixtygun frigate
was Ordes noncommittal answer Head up stream again

Heinzman saw the SPRITE coming and rowed out frantically splashing at
every stroke and yelling with every breath

Dont you go through there Vait a minute Stop I tell you

Hold up said Orde to Marsh

Heinzman rowed alongside dropped his oars and mopped his brow

Vat you do he demanded heatedly

I forgot the money to buy my stamp with said Orde sweetly Im going
back to get it

Not through my pooms cried Heinzman

Mr Heinzman said Orde severely you are obstructing a navigable
stream I am doing business and I cannot be interfered with

But my logs cried the unhappy mill man

I have nothing to do with your logs You are driving your own logs
Orde reminded him

Heinzman vituperated and pounded the gunwale

Go ahead Marsh said Orde

The tug gathered way Soon Heinzman was forced to let go For a second
time the chains were snapped Orde and Marsh looked back over the
churning wake left by the SPRITE The severed ends of the booms were
swinging back toward either shore Between them floated a rowboat In
the rowboat gesticulated a pudgy man The river was well sprinkled with
logs Evidently the sorting was going on well

May as well go back to the works said Orde He wont string them
together again todaynot if he waits for that tug he sent Simpson
for

Accordingly they returned to the booms where work was suspended while
Orde detailed to an appreciative audience the happenings below This
tickled the men immensely

Why we haint sorted out moren a million feet of his logs cried
Rollway Charlie He haint SEEN no logs yet

They turned with new enthusiasm to the work of shunting H logs into
the channel

In ten minutes however the stableman picked his way out over the booms
with a message for Orde

Mr Heinzmans ashore and wants to see you said he

Orde and Jim Denning exchanged glances

Coons come down said the latter

Orde found the mill man pacing restlessly up and down before a
steaming pair of horses Newmark perched on a stump was surveying him
sardonically and chewing the end of an unlighted cigar

Here you poth are burst out Heinzman when Orde stepped ashore Now
this must stop I must not lose my logs Vat is your probosition

Newmark broke in quickly before Orde could speak

Ive told Mr Heinzman said he that we would sort and deliver the
rest of his logs for two dollars a thousand

That will be about it agreed Orde

But exploded Heinzman that is as much as you agreet to drive and
deliffer my whole cut

Precisely said Newmark

Put I haf all the eggspence of driving the logs myself Why shoult I
pay you for doing what I haf alretty paid to haf done

Orde chuckled

Heinzman said he I told you Id make you scratch gravel Now its
time to talk business You thought you were boring with a mighty auger
but its time to revise We arent forced to bother with your logs and
youre lucky to get out so easy If I turn your whole drive into the
river youll lose more than half of it outright and itll cost you a
heap to salvage the rest And whats more Ill turn em in before you
can get hold of a piledriver Ill sort night and day he bluffed
and by tomorrow morning you wont have a stick of timber above my
booms He laughed again You want to get down to business almighty
sudden

When finally Heinzman had driven sadly away and the whole drive H
logs included was pouring into the main boom Orde stretched his arms
over his head in a luxury of satisfaction

That just about settles that campaign he said to Newmark

Oh no it doesnt replied the latter decidedly

Why asked Orde surprised You dont imagine hell do anything
more

No but I will said Newmark

Early in the fall the baby was born It proved to be a boy Orde
nervous as a cat after the ordeal of doing nothing tiptoed into the
darkened room He found his wife weak and pale her dark hair framing
her face a new look of rapt inner contemplation rendering even more
mysterious her always fathomless eyes To Orde she seemed fragile
aloof enshrined among her laces and dainty ribbons Hardly dared he
touch her when she held her hand out to him weakly but fell on his
knees beside the bed and buried his face in the clothes She placed a
gentle hand caressingly on his head

So they remained for some time Finally he raised his eyes She held her
lips to him He kissed them

It seems sort of makebelieve even yet sweetheart she smiled at him
whimsically that we have a real live baby all of our own

Like other people said Orde

Not like other people at all she disclaimed with a show of
indignation

Grandma Orde brought the newcomer in for Ordes inspection He looked
gravely down on the puckered discoloured bit of humanity with some
feeling of disappointment and perhaps a faint uneasiness After a
moment he voiced the latter

Isdo you thinkthat is he hesitated does the doctor say hes
going to be all right

All right cried Grandma Orde indignantly Id like to know if he
isnt all right now What in the world do you expect of a newborn
baby

But Carroll was laughing softly to herself on the bed She held out her
arms for the baby and cuddled it close to her breast

Hes a little darling she crooned and hes going to grow up big
and strong just like his daddy She put her cheek against the sleeping
babes and looked up sidewise at the two standing above her But I know
how you feel she said to her husband When they first showed him to
me I thought he looked like a peanut a thousand years old

Grandma Orde fairly snorted with indignation

Come to your old grandmother who appreciates you she cried
possessing herself of the infant Hes a beautiful baby one of the
bestlooking newborn babies I ever saw

Orde escaped to the open air He had to go to the office to attend to
some details of the business With every step his elation increased At
the office he threw open his desk with a slam Newmark jumped nervously
and frowned Ordes big open and brusque manners bothered him as they
would have bothered a cat

Got a son and heir over at my place called Orde in his big voice

This old firms got to rustle now I tell you

Congratulate you Im sure said Newmark rather shortly Mrs Orde is
doing well I hope

Fine fine cried Orde

Newmark dropped the subject and plunged into a business matter Ordes
attention however was flighty After a little while he closed his desk
with another bang

No use said he Got to make it a vacation Im going to run over to
see how the family is

Strangely enough the young couple had not discussed before the question
of a name One evening at twilight when Orde was perched at the foot of
the bed Carroll brought up the subject

He ought to be named for you she began timidly I know that Jack
and Id love to have another Jack Orde in the family but dear Ive
been thinking about father Hes a poor forlorn old man who doesnt
get much out of life And it would please him sooh more than you can
imagine such a thing could please anybody

She looked up at him doubtfully Orde said nothing but walked around
the bed to where the baby lay in his little cradle He leaned over and
took the infant up in his gingerly awkward fashion

How are you today Bobby Orde he inquired of the blinking mite




XXVIII


The first season of the Boom Company was most successful Its prospects
for the future were bright The drive had been delivered to its various
owners at a price below what it had cost them severally and without the
necessary attendant bother Therefore the loggers were only too willing
to renew their contracts for another year This did not satisfy Newmark
however

What we want he told Orde is a charter giving us exclusive rights
on the river and authorising us to ask toll Im going to try and get
one out of the legislature

He departed for Lansing as soon as the Assembly opened and almost
immediately became lost in one of those fierce struggles of politics not
less bitter because concealed Heinzman was already on the ground

Newmark had the shadow of right on his side for he applied for the
charter on the basis of the river improvements already put in by his
firm Heinzman however possessed much political influence a deep
knowledge of the subterranean workings of plot and counterplot and a
barrel Although armed with an apparently incontestable legal right
Newmark soon found himself fighting on the defensive Heinzman wanted
the improvements already existing condemned and sold as a public utility
to the highest bidder He offered further guarantees as to future
improvements In addition were other and more potent arguments proffered
behind closed doors Many cases resolved themselves into a bald question
of cash Others demanded diplomacy Jobs fat contracts business
favours influence were all flung out freelybribes as absolute as
though stamped with the dollar mark Newspapers all over the State were
pressed into service These bought up by Heinzman and his prospective
partners in a lucrative business spoke virtuously of private piracy
of what are now called public utilities the exploiting of the peoples
natural wealths and all the rest of a specious reasoning the more
convincing in that it was in many other cases only too true The
independent journals uninformed of the rights of the case either
remained silent on the matter or groped in a puzzled and undecided
manner on both sides

Against this secret but effective organisation Newmark most unexpectedly
found himself pitted He had anticipated being absent but a week he
became involved in an affair of months

With decision he applied himself to the problem He took rooms at the
hotel sent for Orde and began at once to set in motion the machinery
of opposition The refreshed resources of the company were strained to
the breaking point in order to raise money for this new campaign opening
before it Orde returning to Lansing after a trip devoted to the
carrying out of Newmarks directions as to finances was dismayed at
the tangle of strategy and crossstrategy innuendo vague and formless
cobweb forces by which he was surrounded He could make nothing of them
They brushed his face he felt their influence yet he could place his
finger on no tangible and comprehensible solidity Among these delicate
and complicated crosscurrents Newmark moved silent cold secret He
seemed to understand them to play with them to manipulate them as
elements of the game Above them was the hollow shock of the ostensible
battlethe speeches the loud talk in lobbies the newspaper virtue
indignation accusations but the real struggle was here in the furtive
ways in whispered words delivered hastily aside in hotel halls on the
way to and from the stairs behind closed doors of rooms without open
transoms

Orde in comic despair acknowledged that it was all too deep for him
Nevertheless it was soon borne in on him that the new company was
struggling for its very right to existence It had been doing that
from the first but now to Orde the fight the existence had a new
importance The company up to this point had been a scheme merely an
experiment that might win or lose Now with the history of a drive
behind it it had become a living entity Orde would have fought against
its dissolution as he would have fought against a murder Yet he had
practically to stand one side watching Newmarks slender grayclad
tense figure gliding here and there more silent more reserved more
watchful every day

The fight endured through most of the first half of the session When
finally it became evident to Heinzman that Newmark would win he made
the issue of toll rates the ditch of his last resistance trying to
force legal charges so low as to eat up the profits At the last
however the bill passed the board The company had its charter

At what price only Newmark could have told He had fought with the tense
earnestness of the nervous temperament that fights to win without count
of the cost The firm was established but it was as heavily in debt as
its credit would stand Newmark himself though as calm and reserved and
precise as ever seemed to have turned gray and one of his eyelids had
acquired a slight nervous twitch which persisted for some months He
took his seat at the desk however as calmly as ever In three days
the scandalised howls of bribery and corruption had given place in the
newspapers to some other sensation

Joe said Orde to his partner how about all this talk Is there
really anything in it You havent gone in for that business have you

Newmark stretched his arms wearily

Press bought up he replied I know for a fact that old Stanford got
five hundred dollars from some of the Heinzman interests I could have
swung him back for an extra hundred but it wasnt worth while They
howl bribery at us to distract attention from their own performances

With this evasive reply Orde contented himself Whether it satisfied
him or whether he was loath to pursue the subject further it would be
impossible to say

Its cost us plenty anyway he said after a moment The
propositions got a load on it It will take us a long time to get
out of debt The river driving wont pay quite so big as we thought it
would he concluded with a rueful little laugh

It will pay plenty well enough replied Newmark decidedly and it
gives us a vantage point to work from You dont suppose we are going to
quit at river driving do you We want to look around for some timber
of our own theres where the big money is And perhaps we can buy a
schooner or two and go into the carrying tradethe countrys alive with
opportunity Newmark and Orde means something to these fellows now We
can have anything we want if we just reach out for it

His thin figure ordinarily slightly askew had straightened his
steelgray impersonal eyes had lit up behind the bowed glasses and were
seeing things beyond the wall at which they gazed Orde looked up at him
with a sudden admiration

Youre the brains of this concern said he

Well get on replied Newmark the fire dying from his eyes




XXIX


In the course of the next eight years Newmark and Orde floated high on
that flood of apparent prosperity that attends a business well conceived
and passably well managed The Boom and Driving Company made money
of course for with the margin of fifty per cent or thereabouts
necessitated by the temporary value of the improvements good years
could hardly fail to bring good returns This it will be remembered
was a stock company With the profits from that business the two men
embarked on a separate copartnership They made money at this too but
the burden of debt necessitated by new ventures constantly weighted
by the heavy interest demanded at that time kept affairs on the ragged
edge

In addition both Orde and Newmark were more inclined to extension of
interests than to playing safe The assets gained in one venture
were promptly pledged to another The ramifications of debt property
mortgages and expectations overlapped each other in a cobweb of
interests

Orde lived at ease in a new house of some size surrounded by grounds
He kept two servants a blooded team of horses drew the successor to the
original buckboard Newmark owned a sail yacht of five or six tons in
which quite solitary he took his only pleasure Both were considered
men of substance and property as indeed they were Only they
risked dollars to gain thousands A succession of bad years a
paniccontraction of money markets any one of a dozen possible though
not probable contingencies would render it difficult to meet the
obligations which constantly came due and which Newmark kept busy
devising ways and means of meeting If things went welland it may be
remarked that legitimately they shouldNewmark and Orde would some day
be rated among the millionaire firms If things went ill bankruptcy
could not be avoided There was no middle ground Nor were Orde and
his partner unique in this practically every firm then developing or
exploiting the natural resources of the country found itself in the same
case

Immediately after the granting of the charter to drive the river the
partners had offered them an opportunity of acquiring about thirty
million feet of timber remaining from Morrison and Dalys original
holdings That firm was very anxious to begin development on a large
scale of its Beeson Lake properties in the Saginaw waters Daly proposed
to Orde that he take over the remnant and having confidence in the
young mans abilities agreed to let him have it on longtime notes
After several consultations with Newmark Orde finally completed the
purchase Below the booms they erected a mill the machinery for which
they had also bought of Daly at Redding The following winter Orde
spent in the woods By spring he had banked ready to drive about six
million feet

For some years these two sorts of activity gave the partners about all
they could attend to As soon as the drive had passed Redding Orde left
it in charge of one of his foremen while he divided his time between the
booms and the mill Late in the year his woods trips began the tours of
inspection of surveying for new roads the inevitable preparation for
the long winter campaigns in the forest As soon as the spring thaws
began once more the drive demanded his attention And in marketing the
lumber manipulating the firms financial affairs collecting its dues
paying its bills making its purchases and keeping oiled the
intricate bearing points of its office machinery Newmark was busyand
invaluable

At the end of the fifth year the opportunity came through a combination
of a bad debt and a mans death to get possession of two lake
schooners Orde at once suggested the contract for a steam barge
Towing was then in its infancy The bulk of lake traffic was by means
of individual sailing shipsa method uncertain as to time Orde thought
that a steam barge could be built powerful enough not only to carry its
own hold and deck loads but to tow after it the two schooners In this
manner the crews could be reduced and an approximate date of delivery
could be guaranteed Newmark agreed with him Thus the firm in
accordance with his prophecy went into the carrying trade for the
vessels more than sufficed for its own needs The freighting of lumber
added much to the income and the carrying of machinery and other heavy
freight on the return trip grew every year

But by far the most important acquisition was that of the northern
peninsula timber Most operators called the white pine along and back
from the river inexhaustible Orde did not believe this He saw the
time not far distant when the world would be compelled to look
elsewhere for its lumber supply and he turned his eyes to the almost
unknown North After a long investigation through agents and a months
landlooking on his own account he located and purchased three hundred
million feet This was to be paid for as usual mostly by the firms
notes secured by its other property It would become available only
in the future but Orde believed as indeed the event justified this
future would prove to be not so distant as most people supposed

As these interests widened Orde became more and more immersed in them
He was forced to be away all of every day and more than the bulk of
every year Nevertheless his home life did not suffer for it

To Carroll he was always the same big hearty wholesouled boy she
had first learned to love She had all his confidence If this did not
extend into business affairs it was because Orde had always tried to
get away from them when at home At first Carroll had attempted to keep
in the current of her husbands activities but as the latter broadened
in scope and became more complex she perceived that their explanation
wearied him She grew out of the habit of asking him about them Soon
their rapid advance had carried them quite beyond her horizon To her
also as to most women the word business connoted nothing but a
turmoil and a mystery

In all other things they were to each other what they had been from the
first No more children had come to them Bobby however had turned out
a sturdy honest little fellow with more than a streak of his mothers
charm and intuition His future was the subject of all Ordes plans

I want to give him all the chance there is he explained to Carroll
A boy ought to start where his father left off and not have to do the
same thing all over again But being a rich mans son isnt much of a
job

Why dont you let him continue your business smiled Carroll secretly
amused at the idea of the small person before them ever doing anything

By the time Bobbys grown up this business will all be closed out
replied Orde seriously

He continued to look at his minute son with puckered brow until Carroll
smoothed out the wrinkles with the tips of her fingers

Of course having only a few minutes to decide she mocked perhaps
wed better make up our minds right now to have him a streetcar
driver

Yes agreed Bobby unexpectedly and with emphasis

Three years after this conversation which would have made Bobby just
eight Orde came back before six of a summer evening his face alight
with satisfaction

Hullo bub he cried to Bobby tossing him to his shoulder Hows the
kid

They went out together while awaiting dinner to see the new setter
puppy in the woodshed

Named him yet asked Orde

Duke said Bobby

Orde surveyed the animal gravely

Seems like a good name said he

After dinner the two adjourned to the library where they sat together
in the big chair and Bobby squirmed a little sidewise in order the
better to see watched the smoke from his fathers cigar as it eddied
and curled in the air

Tell a story he commanded finally

Well acquiesced Orde there was once a man who had a cow

Once upon a time corrected Bobby

He listened for a moment or so

I dont like that story he then announced Tell the story about the
bears

But this is a new story protested Orde and youve heard about the
bears so many times

Bears insisted Bobby

Well once upon a time there were three bearsa big bear and a
middlesized bear and a little bear began Orde obediently

Bobby with a sigh of rapture and content curled up in a snug warm
little ball The twilight darkened

Blindmans holiday warned Carroll behind them so suddenly that they
both jumped And the sand mans been at somebody I know

She bore him away to bed Orde sat smoking in the darkness staring
straight ahead of him into the future He believed he had found the
opportunitytwenty years distantfor which he had been looking so
long




XXX


After a time Carroll descended the stairs chuckling Jack she called
into the sittingroom come out on the porch What do you suppose the
young man did tonight

Give it up replied Orde promptly No good guessing when its a
question of that youngsters performances What was it

He said his Now I lay me and asked blessings on you and me and the
grandpas and grandmas and Auntie Kate as usual Then he stopped
What else I reminded him And he finished with a rush
makeBobbyagoodboyandgivehimplentyofbreadnbuttern
applesauce

They laughed delightedly over this clinging together like two children
Then they stepped out on the little porch and looked into the fathomless
night The sky was full of stars aloof and calm but waiting breathless
on the edge of action attending the word of command or the celestial
vision or whatever it is for which stars seem to wait Along the
street the dense velvet shade of the maples threw the sidewalks into
impenetrable blackness Sounds carried clearly From the Weltons down
the street came the tinkle of a mandolin and an occasional low laugh
from the group of young people that nightly frequented the front steps
Tree toads chirped in unison or fell abruptly silent as though by
signal All up and down the rows of houses whirred the low monotone of
the lawn sprinklers and the aroma of their wetness was borne cool and
refreshing through the tepid air

Orde and his wife sat together on the top step He slipped his arm about
her They said nothing but breathed deep of the quiet happiness that
filled their lives

The gate latch clicked and two shadowy figures defined themselves
approaching up the concrete walk

Hullo called Orde cheerfully into the darkness

Hullo a mans voice instantly responded

Taylor and Clara said Orde to Carroll with satisfaction Just the
man I wanted to see

The lawyer and his wife mounted the steps He was a quick energetic
spare man with lean cheeks a bristling clipped moustache and
a slight stoop to his shoulders She was small piquant almost
childlike with a dainty upturned nose a large and lustrous eye
a constant birdlike animation of mannerthe Folly of artists the
adorable lovable harmless Folly standing tiptoe on a complaisant
world

Just the man I wanted to see repeated Orde as the two approached

Clara Taylor stopped short and considered him for a moment

Let us away she said seriously to Carroll My prophetic soul tells
me they are going to talk business and if any more business is talked
in my presence I shall EXPIRE

Both men laughed but Orde explained apologetically

Well you know Mrs Taylor these are my especially busy days for the
firm and I have to work my private affairs in when I can

I thought Frank was very solicitous about my getting out in the air
cried Clara Come Carroll lets wander down the street and see Mina
Heinzman

The two interlocked arms and sauntered along the walk Both men lit
cigars and sat on the top step of the porch

Look here Taylor broke in Orde abruptly you told me the other day
you had fifteen or twenty thousand you wanted to place somewhere

Yes replied Taylor

Well I believe I have just the proposition

What is it

California pine replied Orde

California pine repeated Taylor after a slight pause Why
California Thats a long way off And theres no market is there Why
way out there

Its cheap replied Orde succinctly I dont say it will be good
for immediate returns nor even for returns in the near future but in
twenty or thirty years it ought to pay big on a small investment made
now

Taylor shook his head doubtfully

I dont see how you figure it he objected We have more timber than
we can use in the East Why should we go several thousand miles west for
the same thing

When our timber gives out then well HAVE to go west said Orde

Taylor laughed

Laugh all you please rejoined Orde but I tell you Michigan and
Wisconsin pine is doomed Twenty or thirty years from now there wont be
any white pine for sale

Nonsense objected Taylor Youre talking wild We havent even begun
on the upper peninsula After that theres Minnesota And I havent
observed that were quite out of timber on the river or the Muskegon
or the Saginaw or the Grand or the Cheboyganwhy Great Scott man
our childrens childrens children may be thinking of investing in
California timber but thats about soon enough

All tight said Orde quietly Well what do you think of Indiana as a
good field for timber investment

Indiana cried Taylor amazed Why theres no timber there its a
prairie

There used to be And all the southern Michigan farm belt was timbered
and around here We have our stumps to show for it but there are no
evidences at all farther south Youd have hard work for instance to
persuade a stranger that Van Buren County was once forest

Was it asked Taylor doubtfully

It was You take your map and see how much area has been cut already
and how much remains Thatll open your eyes And remember all that has
been done by crude methods for a relatively small demand The demand
increases as the country grows and methods improve It would not
surprise me if some day thirty or forty millions would constitute an
average cut  Michigan pine exhaustlessthose fellows make me sick

  At the present day some firms cut as high as 150000000
 feet

Sounds a little more reasonable said Taylor slowly

Itll sound a lot more reasonable in five or ten years insisted
Orde and then youll see the big men rushing out into that Oregon and
California country But now a man can get practically the pick of the
coast There are only a few big concerns out there

Why is it that no one

Because Orde cut him short the big things are for the fellow who
can see far enough ahead

What kind of a proposition have you asked Taylor after a pause

I can get ten thousand acres at an average price of eight dollars an
acre replied Orde

Acres What does that mean in timber

On this particular tract it means about four hundred million feet

Thats about twenty cents a thousand

Orde nodded

And of course you couldnt operate for a long time

Not for twenty maybe thirty years replied Orde calmly

Theres your interest on your money and taxes and the risk of fire
and

Of course of course agreed Orde impatiently but youre getting
your stumpage for twenty cents or a little more and in thirty years it
will be worth as high as a dollar and a half 

  At the present time 1908 sugar pine such as Orde
 described would cost 350 to 4

What cried Taylor

That is my opinion said Orde

Taylor relapsed into thought

Look here Orde he broke out finally how old are you

Thirtyeight Why

How much timber have you in Michigan

About ten million that weve picked up on the river since the Daly
purchase and three hundred million in the northern peninsula

Which will take you twenty years to cut and make you a million dollars
or so

Hope so

Then why this investment thirty years ahead

Its for Bobby explained Orde simply A man likes to have his son
continue on in his business I cant do it here but there I can It
would take fifty years to cut that pine and that will give Bobby a
steady income and a steady business

Bobby will be well enough off anyway He wont have to go into
business

Ordes brow puckered

I know a manBobby is going to work A man is not a success in life
unless he does something and Bobby is going to be a success Why
Taylor he chuckled the little rascal fills the woodbox for a cent a
time and thats all the pocketmoney he gets Hes saving now to buy a
thousanddollar boat Ive agreed to pool in half At his present rate
of income Im safe for about sixty years yet

How soon are you going to close this deal asked Taylor rising as he
caught sight of two figures coming up the walk

I have an option until November 1 replied Orde If you cant make
it I guess I can swing it myself By the way keep this dark

Taylor nodded and the two turned to defend themselves as best they
could against Claras laughing attack

Orde had said nothing to Newmark concerning this purposed new
investment nor did he intend doing so

It is for Bobby he told himself and I want Bobby and no one else
to run it Joe would want to take charge naturally Taylor wont He
knows nothing of the business

He walked downtown next morning busily formulating his scheme At the
office he found Newmark already seated at his desk a pile of letters
in front of him Upon Ordes boisterous greeting his nerves crisped
slightly but of this there was no outward sign beyond a tightening of
his hands on the letter he was reading Behind his eyeglasses his
blue cynical eyes twinkled like frost crystals As always he was
immaculately dressed in neat gray clothes and carried in one corner of
his mouth an unlighted cigar

Joe said Orde spinning a chair to Newmarks rolltop desk and
speaking in a low tone just how do we stand on that upper peninsula
stumpage

What do you mean How much of it is there You know that as well as I
doabout three hundred million

No I mean financially

Weve made two payments of seventyfive thousand each and have still
two to make of the same amount

What could we borrow on it

We dont want to borrow anything on it returned Newmark in a flash

Perhaps not but if we should

We might raise fifty or seventyfive thousand I suppose

Joe said Orde I want to raise about seventyfive thousand dollars
on my share in this concern if it can be done

Whats up inquired Newmark keenly

Its a private matter

Newmark said nothing but for some time thought busily his light blue
eyes narrowed to a slit

Ill have to figure on it a while said he at last and turned back
to his mail All day he worked hard with only a fifteenminute
intermission for a lunch which was brought up from the hotel below At
six oclock he slammed shut the desk He descended the stairs with Orde
from whom he parted at their foot and walked precisely away his tall
thin figure held rigid and slightly askew his pale eyes slitted behind
his eyeglasses the unlighted cigar in one corner of his straight lips
To the occasional passerby he bowed coldly and with formality At the
corner below he bore to the left and after a short walk entered the
small onestory house set well back from the sidewalk among the clumps
of oleanders Here he turned into a study quietly and richly furnished
ten years in advance of the taste then prevalent in Monrovia where he
sank into a deepcushioned chair and lit the muchchewed cigar For some
moments he lay back with his eyes shut Then he opened them to look with
approval on the dark walnut bookcases the framed prints and etchings
the bronzed students lamp on the square table desk the rugs on the
polished floor He picked up a magazine into which he dipped for ten
minutes

The door opened noiselessly behind him

Mr Newmark sir came a respectful voice it is just short of
seven

Very well replied Newmark without looking around

The man withdrew as softly as he had come After a moment Newmark
replaced the magazine on the table yawned threw aside the cigar of
which he had smoked but an inch and passed from his study into
his bedroom across the hall This contained an exquisite Colonial
fourposter with a lowboy and dresser to match and was papered and
carpeted in accordance with these its chief ornaments Newmark bathed
in the adjoining bathroom shaved carefully between the two wax
lights which were his whim and dressed in what were then known as
swallowtail clothes Probably he was the only man in Monrovia at that
moment so apparelled Then calmly and with all the deliberation of one
under fire of a hundred eyes he proceeded to the diningroom where
waited the man who had a short time before reminded him of the hour He
was a solemn dignified man whose like was not to be found elsewhere
this side the city He too wore the swallowtail but its buttons
were of gilt

Newmark seated himself in a leatherupholstered mahogany chair before a
small round mahogany table The room was illuminated only by four wax
candles with red shades They threw into relief the polish of mahogany
the glitter of glass the shine of silver but into darkness the detail
of massive sideboard dull panelling and the two or three darktoned
sporting prints on the wall

You may serve dinner Mallock said Newmark

He ate deliberately and with enjoyment the meal exquisitely prepared
and exquisitely presented to him With it he drank a single glass of
Burgundya deed that would in the eyes of Monrovia have condemned him
as certainly as driving a horse on Sunday or playing cards for a stake
Afterward he returned to the study whither Mallock brought coffee He
lit another cigar opened a drawer in his desk extracted therefrom some
bankbooks and small personal account books From these he figured all
the evening His cigar went out but he did not notice that and chewed
away quite contentedly on the dead butt When he had finished his cold
eye exhibited a gleam of satisfaction He had resolved on a course of
action At ten oclock he went to bed

Next morning Mallock closed the door behind him promptly upon the stroke
of eight It was strange that not one living soul but Mallock had ever
entered Newmarks abode Curiosity had at first brought a few callers
but these were always met by the imperturbable servant with so plausible
a reason for his masters absence that the visitors had departed without
a suspicion that they had been deliberately excluded And as Newmark
made no friends and excited little interest the attempts to cultivate
him gradually ceased

Orde said Newmark as the former entered the office I think I can
arrange this matter

Orde drew up a chair

I talked last evening with a man from Detroit named Thayer who thinks
he may advance seventyfive thousand dollars on a mortgage on our
northern peninsula stumpage For that of course we will give the
firms note with interest at ten per cent I will turn this over to
you

Thats began Orde

Hold on interrupted Newmark As collateral security you will deposit
for me your stock in the Boom Company indorsed in blank If you do not
pay the full amount of the firms note to Thayer then the stock will be
turned in to me

I see said Orde

Now dont misunderstand me said Newmark drily This is your own
affair and I do not urge it on you If we raise as much as seventyfive
thousand dollars on that upper peninsula stumpage it will be all it
can stand for next year we must make a third payment on it If you take
that money it is of course proper that you pay the interest on it

Certainly said Orde

And if theres any possibility of the foreclosure of the mortgage it
is only right that you run all the risk of lossnot myself

Certainly repeated Orde

From another point of view went on Newmark you are practically
mortgaging your interest in the Boom Company for seventyfive thousand
dollars That would make on the usual basis of a mortgage your share
worth above two hundred thousandand four hundred thousand is a high
valuation of our property

That looks more than decent on your part said Orde

Of course its none of my business what you intend to do with this
went on Newmark but unless youre SURE you can meet these notes I
should strongly advise against it

The same remark applies to any mortgage rejoined Orde

Exactly

For how long a time could I get this asked Orde at length

I couldnt promise it for longer than five years replied Newmark

That would make about fifteen thousand a year

And interest

Certainlyand interest Well I dont see why I cant carry that
easily on our present showing and prospects

If nothing untoward happens insisted Newmark determined to put
forward all objections possible

Its not much risk said Orde hopefully Theres nothing surer
than lumber Well pay the notes easily enough as we cut and the Boom
Companys on velvet now What do our earnings figure anyway

Were driving one hundred and fifty million at a profit of about sixty
cents a thousand said Newmark

Thats ninety thousand dollarsin five years four hundred and fifty
thousand said Orde sucking his pencil

We ought to clean up five dollars a thousand on our mill

Thats about a hundred thousand on what weve got left

And that little barge business nets us about twelve or fifteen thousand
a year

For the five years about sixty thousand more Lets seethats a total
of say six hundred thousand dollars in five years

We will have to take up in that time said Newmark who seemed to have
the statistics at his fingertips the two payments on our timber
the note on the First National the Commercial note the remaining
liabilities on the Boom Companyabout three hundred thousand all told
counting the interest

Orde crumpled the paper and threw it into the waste basket

Correct said he Good enough I ought to get along on a margin like
that

He went over to his own desk where he again set to figuring on his
pad The results he eyed a little doubtfully Each year he must pay in
interest the sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars Each year
he would have to count on a proportionate saving of fifteen thousand
dollars toward payment of the notes In addition he must live

The Orde family is going to be mighty hard up said he whistling
humorously

But Orde was by nature and training sanguine and fond of big risks

Never mind its for Bobby said he to himself And maybe the rate
of interest will go down And Ill be able to borrow on the California
tract if anything does go wrong

He put on his hat thrust a bundle of papers into his pocket and
stepped across the hall into Taylors office

The lawyer he found tipped back in his revolving chair reading a
printed brief

Frank began Orde immediately I came to see you about that
California timber matter

Taylor laid down the brief and removed his eyeglasses with which he
began immediately to tap the fingers of his left hand

Sit down Jack said he Im glad you came in I was going to try
to see you some time today Ive been thinking the matter over very
carefully since the other day and Ive come to the conclusion that it
is too steep for me I dont doubt the investment a bit but the returns
are too far off Fifteen thousand means a lot more to me than it does to
you and Ive got to think of the immediate future I hope you werent
counting on me

Oh thats all right broke in Orde As I told you I can swing the
thing myself and only mentioned it to you on the off chance you might
want to invest Now what I want is this he proceeded to outline
carefully the agreement between himself and Newmark while the lawyer
took notes and occasionally interjected a question

All right said the latter when the details had been mastered Ill
draw the necessary notes and papers

Now went on Orde producing the bundle of papers from his pocket
heres the abstract of title I wish youd look it over Its a long
one but not complicated as near as I can make out Trace seems to have
acquired this tract mostly from the original homesteaders and the like
who of course take title direct from the government But naturally
there are a heap of them and I want you to look it over to be sure
everythings shipshape

All right agreed Taylor reaching for the papers

One other thing concluded Orde uncrossing his legs I want this
investment to get no further than the office door You see this is
for Bobby and Ive given a lot of thought to that sort of thing and
nothing spoils a man sooner than to imagine the things all cut and
dried for him and nothing keeps him going like the thought that hes
got to rustle his own opportunities You and I know that Bobbys
going to have the best education possible hes going to learn to be a
lumberman by practical experience and that practical experience hell
get with other people No working for his dad in Bobbys I can tell
you When he gets through college Ill get him a little job clerking
with some good firm and hell have a chance to show what is in him and
to learn the business from the ground up the way a man ought to Of
course Ill make arrangements that he has a real chance Then when
hes worked into the harness a little the old man will take him out and
show him the fine big sugar pine and say to him There my boy theres
your opportunity and youve earned it How does ORDE AND SON sound to
you What do you think of it Frank

Taylor nodded several times

I believe youre on the right track and Ill help you all I can said
he briefly

So of course I want to keep the thing dead secret continued Orde
Youre the only man who knows anything about it Im not even going
to buy directly under my own name Im going to incorporate myself he
said with a grin You know how those things will get out and how they
always get back to the wrong people

Count on me Taylor assured him

As Orde walked home that evening after a hot day his mind was full of
speculation as to the immediate future He had a local reputation for
wealth and no one knew better than himself how important it is for a
man in debt to keep up appearances Nevertheless decided retrenchment
would be necessary After Bobby had gone to bed he explained this to
his wife

Whats the matter she asked quickly Is the firm losing money

No replied Orde its a matter of reinvestment He hesitated Its
a dead secret which I dont want to get out but Im thinking of buying
some western timber for Bobby when he grows up

Carroll laughed softly

You so relieve my mind she smiled at him I was afraid youd decided
on the streetcardriver idea Why sweetheart you know perfectly well
we could go back to the little house next the church and be as happy as
larks

In the meantime Newmark had closed his desk picked his hat from the
nail and marched precisely down the street to Heinzmans office He
found the little German in Newmark demanded a private interview and
without preliminary plunged into the business that had brought him He
had long since taken Heinzmans measure as indeed he had taken
the measure of every other man with whom he did or was likely to do
business

Heinzman said he abruptly my partner wants to raise seventyfive
thousand dollars for his personal use I have agreed to get him that
money from the firm

Heinzman sat immovable his round eyes blinking behind his big
spectacles

Proceed said he shrewdly

As security in case he cannot pay the notes the firm will have to give
he has signed an agreement to turn over to me his undivided onehalf
interest in our enterprises

Vell You vant to borrow dot money of me asked Heinzman I could not
raise it

I know that perfectly well replied Newmark coolly You are going to
have difficulty meeting your July notes as it is

Heinzman hardly seemed to breathe but a flicker of red blazed in his
eye

Proceed he repeated noncommittally after a moment I intend went
on Newmark to furnish this money myself It must however seem to be
loaned by another I want you to lend this money on mortgage

What for asked Heinzman

For a one tenth of Ordes share in case he does not meet those notes

But he vill meet the notes objected Heinzman You are a prosperous
concern I know somethings of YOUR business also

He thinks he will rejoined Newmark grimly I will merely point
out to you that his entire income is from the firm and that from this
income he must save twentyodd thousand a year

If the firm has hard luck said Heinzman

Exactly finished Newmark

Vy you come to me demanded Heinzman at length

Well Im offering you a chance to get even with Orde I dont imagine
you love him

Vats de matter mit my gettin efen with you too cried Heinzman
Aint you beat me out at Lansing

Newmark smiled coldly under his clipped moustache

Im offering you the chance of making anywhere from thirty to fifty
thousand dollars

Perhaps And suppose this liddle scheme dont work out

And pursued Newmark calmly Ill carry you over in your present
obligations He suddenly hit the arm of his chair with his clenched
fist Heinzman if you dont make those July payments whats to become
of you Wheres your timber and your mills and your new houseand that
pretty daughter of yours

Heinzman winced visibly

I vill get an extension of time said he feebly

Will you countered Newmark

The two men looked each other in the eye for a moment

Vell maybe laughed Heinzman uneasily It looks to me like a
winner

All right then said Newmark briskly Ill make out a mortgage at
ten per cent for you and youll lend the money on it At the proper
time if things happen that way you will foreclose Thats all you
have to do with it Then when the timber land comes to you under the
foreclose you will reconvey an undivided ninetenths interestfor
proper consideration of course and without recording the deed

Heinzman laughed with assumed lightness

Suppose I fool you said he I guess I joost keep it for mineself

Newmark looked at him coldly

I wouldnt he advised You may remember the member from Lapeer
County in that charter fight And the five hundred dollars for his vote
Try it on and see how much evidence I can bring up Its called bribery
in this State and means penitentiary usually

You dont take a joke complained Heinzman

Newmark arose

Its understood then he asked

How so I know you play fair asked the German

You dont Its a case where we have to depend more or less on each
other But I dont see what you stand to loseand anyway youll get
carried over those July payments Newmark reminded him

Heinzman was plainly uneasy and slightly afraid of these new waters in
which he swam

If you reduce the firms profits he iss going to suspect he
admonished

Who said anything about reducing the firms profits said Newmark
impatiently If it does work out that way well win a big thing if it
does not well lose nothing

He nodded to Heinzman and left the office His demeanour was as dry and
precise as ever No expression illuminated his impassive countenance If
he felt the slightest uneasiness over having practically delivered his
intentions to the keeping of another he did not show it For one thing
an accomplice was absolutely essential And too he held the German by
his strongest passionshis avarice his dread of bankruptcy his pride
and his fear of the penitentiary As he entered the office of his own
firm his eye fell on Ordes bulky form seated at the desk He paused
involuntarily and a slight shiver shook his frame from head to
footthe dainty instinctive repulsion of a cat for a large robustious
dog Instantly controlling himself he stepped forward

Ive made the loan he announced

Orde looked up with interest

The banks wouldnt touch northern peninsula said Newmark steadily
so I had to go to private individuals

So you said Dont care who deals it out laughed Orde

Thayer backed out so finally I got the whole amount from Heinzman
Newmark announced

Didnt know the old Dutchman was that well off said Orde after a
slight pause

Cant tell about those secretive old fellows said Newmark

Orde hesitated

I didnt know he was friendly enough to lend us money

Business is business replied Newmark




XXXIII


There exists the legend of an eastern despot who wishing to rid himself
of a courtier armed the man and shut him in a dark room The victim
knew he was to fight something but whence it was to come when or of
what nature he was unable to guess In the event while groping tense
for an enemy he fell under the fatal fumes of noxious gases

From the moment Orde completed the secret purchase of the California
timber lands from Trace he became an unwitting participant in one of
the strangest duels known to business history Newmark opposed to him
all the subtleties all the ruses and expedients to which his position
lent itself Orde sublimely unconscious deployed the magnificent
resources of strength energy organisation and combative spirit that
animated his pioneers soul The occult manoeuverings of Newmark called
out fresh exertions on the part of Orde

Newmark worked under this disadvantage he had carefully to avoid the
slightest appearance of an attitude inimical to the firms very best
prosperity A breath of suspicion would destroy his plans If the
smallest untoward incident should ever bring it clearly before Orde that
Newmark might have an interest in reducing profits he could not fail
to tread out the logic of the latters devious ways For this reason
Newmark could not as yet fight even in the twilight He did not dare
make bad sales awkward transactions In spite of his best efforts he
could not succeed without the aid of chance in striking a blow from
which Orde could not recover The profits of the first year were not
quite up to the usual standard but they sufficed Newmarks finesse cut
in two the firms income of the second year Orde roused himself With
his oldtime energy of resource he hurried the woods work until an
especially big cut gave promise of recouping the losses of the year
before Newmark found himself struggling against a force greater than
he had imagined it to be Blinded and bound it nevertheless made head
against his policy Newmark was forced to a temporary quiescence He
held himself watchful intent awaiting the opportunity which chance
should bring

Chance seemed by no means in haste The end of the fourth year found
Newmark puzzled Orde had paid regularly the interest on his notes
How much he had been able to save toward the redemption of the notes
themselves his partner was unable to decide It depended entirely on how
much the Ordes had disbursed in living expenses whether or not Orde had
any private debts and whether or not he had private resources In the
meantime Newmark contented himself with tying up the firms assets in
such a manner as to render it impossible to raise money on its property
when the time should come

What Orde regarded as a series of petty annoyances had made the problem
of paying for the California timber a matter of greater difficulty than
he had supposed it would be A pressure whose points of support he could
not place was closing slowly on him Against this pressure he exerted
himself It made him a trifle uneasy but it did not worry him The
margin of safety was not as broad as he had reckoned but it existed
And in any case if worse came to worst he could always mortgage
the California timber for enough to make up the differenceand more
Against this expedient however he opposed a sentimental obstinacy
It was Bobbys and he objected to encumbering it In fact Orde
was capable of a prolonged and bitter struggle to avoid doing so
Nevertheless it was therean asset A loan on its security would with
what he had set aside more than pay the notes on the northern peninsula
stumpage Orde felt perfectly easy in his mind He was in the position
of many of our rich mens sons who quite sincerely and earnestly go
penniless to the city to make their way They live on their nine dollars
a week and go hungry when they lose their jobs They stand on their own
feet and yetin case of severe illness or actual starvationthe old
man is there It gives them a courage to be contented on nothing So
Orde would have gone to almost any lengths to keep free Bobbys tract
but it stood always between himself and disaster And a loan on western
timber could be paid off just as easily as a loan on eastern timber
when you came right down to that Even could he have known his partners
intentions they would on this account have caused him no uneasiness
however angry they would have made him or however determined to break
the partnership Even though Newmark destroyed utterly the firms
profits for the remaining year and a half the notes had to run he could
not thereby ruin Ordes chances A loan on the California timber would
solve all problems now In this reasoning Orde would have committed
the mistake of all large and generous temperaments when called upon to
measure natures more subtle than their own He would have underestimated
both Newmarks resources and his own grasp of situations 


  The author has considered it useless to burden the course
 of the narrative with a detailed account of Newmarks
 financial manoeuvres Realising however that a large class
 of his readers might be interested in the exact particulars
 he herewith gives a sketch of the transactions

 It will be remembered that at the time1878Orde first
 came in need of money for the purpose of buying the
 California timber the firm Newmark and Orde owned in the
 northern peninsula 300000000 feet of pine On this they
 had paid 150000 and owed still a like amount They
 borrowed 75000 on it giving a note secured by mortgage
 due in 1883 Orde took this giving in return his note
 secured by the Boom Companys stock In 1879 and 1880 they
 made the two final payments on the timber so that by the
 latter date they owned the land free of encumbrance save for
 the mortgage of 75000 Since Newmarks plan had always
 contemplated the eventual foreclosure of this mortgage it
 now became necessary further to encumber the property
 Otherwise since a property worth considerably above
 300000 carried only a 75000 mortgage it would be
 possible when the latter came due to borrow a further sum
 on a second mortgage with which to meet the obligations of
 the first Therefore Newmark in 1881 approached Orde with
 the request that the firm raise 70000 by means of a second
 mortgage on the timber This 70000 he proposed to borrow
 personally giving his note due in 1885 and putting up the
 same collateral as Orde hadthat is to say his stock in
 the Boom Company To this Orde could hardly in reason oppose
 an objection as it nearly duplicated his own transaction of
 1878 Newmark therefore through Heinzman lent this sum to
 himself

 It may now be permitted to forecast events in the line of
 Newmarks reasoning

 If his plans should work out this is what would happen in
 1883 the firms note for 75000 would come due Orde would
 be unable to pay it Therefore at once his stock in the Boom
 Company would become the property of Newmark and Orde
 Newmark would profess himself unable to raise enough from
 the firm to pay the mortgage The second mortgage from which
 he had drawn his personal loan would render it impossible
 for the firm to raise more money on the land A foreclosure
 would follow Through Heinzman Newmark would buy in As he
 had himself loaned the money to himselfagain through
 Heinzmanon the second mortgage the latter would occasion
 him no loss

 The net results of the whole transaction would be first
 that Newmark would have acquired personally the 300000000
 feet of northern peninsula timber and second that Ordes
 personal share in the stock company would flow be held in
 partnership by the two Thus in order to gain so large a
 stake it would pay Newmark to suffer considerable loss
 jointly with Orde in the induced misfortunes of the firm

 Incidentally it might be remarked that Newmark of course
 purposed paying his own note to the firm when it should fall
 due in 1885 thus saving for himself the Boom Company stock
 which he had put up as collateral


Affairs stood thus in the autumn before the year the notes would come
due The weather had been beautiful A perpetual summer seemed to have
embalmed the world in its forgetfulness of times and seasons Navigation
remained open through October and into November No severe storms had as
yet swept the lakes The barge and her two tows had made one more trip
than had been thought possible It had been the intention to lay them
up for the winter but the weather continued so mild that Orde suggested
they be laden with a consignment for Jones and Mabley of Chicago

Did intend to ship by rail said he Theyre all uppers so it
would pay all right But we can save all kinds of money by water and
they ought to skip over there in twelve to fifteen hours

Accordingly the three vessels were laid alongside the wharves at the
mill and as fast as possible the selected lumber was passed into their
holds Orde departed for the woods to start the cutting as soon as the
first belated snow should fall

This condition seemed however to delay During each night it grew
cold The leaves after their blaze and riot of colour turned crisp and
crackly and brown Some of the little still puddles were filmed with
what was almost but not quite ice A sheen of frost whitened the house
roofs and silvered each separate blade of grass on the lawns But by
noon the sun rising red in the veil of smoke that hung low in the
snappy air had mellowed the atmosphere until it lay on the cheek like a
caress No breath of wind stirred Sounds came clearly from a distance
Long Vshaped flights of geese swept athwart the sky very high up but
their honking came faintly to the ear And yet when the sun swollen
to the great dimensions of the rising moon dipped bloodred through the
haze the first premonitory tingle of cold warned one that the grateful
warmth of the day had been but an illusion of a season that had gone
This was not summer but in the quaint old phrase Indian summer and
its end would be as though the necromancer had waved his wand

To Newmark sitting at his desk reported Captain Floyd of the steam
barge NORTH STAR

All loaded by noon sir he said

Newmark looked up in surprise

Well why do you tell me he inquired

I want your orders

My orders Why

This is a bad time of year explained Captain Floyd and the storm
signals up All the signs are right for a blow

Newmark whirled in his chair

A blow he cried What of it You dont come in every time it blows
do you

You dont know the lakes sir at this time of year insisted Captain
Floyd

Are you afraid sneered Newmark

Captain Floyds countenance burned a dark red

I only want your orders was all he said I thought we might wait to
see

Then go snapped Newmark That lumber must get to the market You
heard Mr Ordes orders to sail as soon as you were loaded

Captain Floyd nodded curtly and went out without further comment

Newmark arose and looked out of the window The sun shone as balmily
soft as ever English sparrows twittered and fought outside The warm
smell of pine shingles rose from the street Only close down to the
horizon lurked cold flat greasylooking clouds and in the direction
of the Government flagpole he caught the flash of red from the lazily
floating signal He was little weatherwise and he shook his head
sceptically Nevertheless it was a chance and he took it as he had
taken a great many others




XXXIV


To Carrolls delight Orde returned unexpectedly from the woods late
that night He was so busy these days that she welcomed any chance to
see him Much to his disappointment Bobby had been taken duckhunting
by his old friend Mr Kincaid Next morning however Orde told Carroll
his stay would be short and that his day would be occupied

Id take old Prince and get some air he advised Youre too much
indoors Get some friend and drive around Its fine and blowy out and
youll get some colour in your cheeks

After breakfast Carroll accompanied her husband to the front door When
they opened it a blast of air rushed in whirling some dead leaves with
it

I guess the fine weathers over said Orde looking up at the sky

A dull lead colour had succeeded the soft gray of the preceding balmy
days The heavens seemed to have settled down closer to the earth
A rising wind whistled through the branches of the big maple trees
snatching the remaining leaves in handfuls and tossing them into the
air The tops swayed like whips Whirlwinds scurried among the piles of
dead leaves on the lawns scattering them chasing them madly around and
around in circles

Brrr shivered Carroll Winters coming

She kept herself busy about the house all the morning ate her lunch in
solitude Outside the fierce wind rising in a crescendo shriek howled
around the eaves The day darkened but no rain fell At last Carroll
resolved to take her husbands advice She stopped for Mina Heinzman
and the two walked around to the stable where the men harnessed old
Prince into the phaeton

They drove the wind at their backs across the drawbridge past the
shipyards and out beyond the mills to the Marsh Road There on either
side the causeway miles and miles of cattails and reeds bent and
recovered under the snatches of the wind Here and there showed glimpses
of ponds or little inlets the surface of the water ruffled and dark
blue Occasionally one of these bayous swung in across the road Then
the two girls could see plainly the fanlike catspaws skittering here
and there as though panicstricken by the swooping invisible monster
that pursued them

Carroll and Mina Heinzman had a good time They liked each other very
much and always saw a great deal to laugh at in the things about them
and in the subjects about which they talked When however they turned
toward home they were forced silent by the mighty power of the wind
against them The tears ran from their eyes as though they were crying
they had to lower their heads Hardly could Carroll command vision clear
enough to see the road along which she was driving This was really
unnecessary for Prince was buffeted to a walk Thus they crawled along
until they reached the turnbridge where the rightangled change
in direction gave them relief The river was full of choppy waves
considerable in size As they crossed the SPRITE darted beneath them
lowering her smokestack as she went under the bridge

They entered Main Street where was a great banging and clanging of
swinging signs and a few loose shutters All the sidewalk displays of
vegetables and other goods had been taken in and the doors customarily
wide open were now shut fast This alone lent to the street quite a
deserted air which was emphasised by the fact that actually not a rig
of any sort stood at the curbs Up the empty roadway whirled one after
the other clouds of dust hurried by the wind

I wonder where all the farmers wagons are marvelled the practical
Mina Surely they would not stay home Saturday afternoon just for this
wind

Opposite Randalls hardware store her curiosity quite mastered her

Do stop she urged Carroll I want to run in and see whats the
matter

She was gone but a moment and returned her eyes shining with
excitement

Oh Carroll she cried there are three vessels gone ashore off the
piers Everybodys gone to see

Jump in said Carroll Well drive out Perhaps theyll get out the
lifesaving crew

They drove up the plank road over the sandhill through the beech
woods to the bluff above the shore In the woods they were somewhat
sheltered from the wind although even there the crash of falling
branches and the whirl of twigs and dead leaves advertised that the
powers of the air were abroad but when they topped the last rise the
unobstructed blast from the open Lake hit them square between the eyes

Probably a hundred vehicles of all descriptions were hitched to trees
just within the fringe of woods Carroll however drove straight ahead
until Prince stood at the top of the plank road that led down to the
bath houses Here she pulled up

Carroll saw the lake slate blue and angry with whitecapped billows
to the limit of vision Along the shore were rows and rows of breakers
leaping breaking and gathering again until they were lost in a tumble
of white foam that rushed and receded on the sands These did not look
to be very large until she noticed the twin piers reaching out from the
rivers mouth Each billow as it came in rose sullenly above them
broke tempestuously to overwhelm the entire structure of their ends and
ripped inshore along their lengths the crest submerging as it ran every
foot of the massive structures The piers and the lighthouses at their
ends looked like little toys and the compact black crowd of people on
the shore below were as small as Bobbys tin soldiers

Look thereout farther pointed Mina

Carroll looked and rose to her feet in excitement

Three little toy shipsor so they seemed compared to the mountains of
waterlay broadsideto just inside the farthest line of breakers Two
were sailing schooners These had been thrown on their beam ends their
masts pointing at an angle toward the beach Each wave as it reached
stirred them a trifle then broke in a deluge of water that for a moment
covered their hulls completely from sight With a mighty suction the
billow drained away carrying with it wreckage The third vessel was a
steam barge She too was broadside to the seas but had caught in some
hole in the bar so that she lay far down by the head The shoreward side
of her upper works had for some freakish reason given away first so
now the interior of her staterooms and saloons was exposed to view as in
the crosssection of a model ship Over her too the great waves
hurled themselves each carrying away its spoil To Carroll it seemed
fantastically as though the barge were made of sugar and that each sea
melted her precisely as Bobby loved to melt the lump in his chocolate by
raising and lowering it in a spoon

And the queer part of it all was that these waves so mighty in their
effects appeared to the woman no different from those she had often
watched in the light summer blows that for a few hours raise the white
caps on the lake They came in from the open in the same swift yet
deliberate ranks they gathered with the same leisurely pauses they
broke with the same rush and roar They seemed no larger but everything
else had been struck smallthe tiny ships the toy piers the antlike
swarm of people on the shore She looked on it as a spectacle It had as
yet no human significance

Poor fellows cried Mina

What asked Carroll

Dont you see them queried the other

Carroll looked and in the rigging of the schooner she made out a number
of black objects

Are those menup the masts she cried

She set Prince in motion toward the beach

At the foot of the bluff the plank road ran out into the deep sand
Through this the phaeton made its way heavily The fine particles were
blown in the air like a spray mingling with the spume from the lake
stinging Carrolls face like so many needles Already the beach was
strewn with pieces of wreckage some of it cast high above the wash
others still thrown up and sucked back by each wave others again rising
and falling in the billows This wreckage constituted a miscellaneous
jumble although most of it was lumber from the deckloads of the
vessels Intermingled with the split and broken yellow boards were bits
of carving and of painted wood Carroll saw one piece half buried in the
sand which bore in gilt two huge letters A R A little farther bent
and twisted projected the ornamental spear which had pointed the way
before the steamers bow Portions of the usual miscellaneous freight
cargo carried on every voyage were scattered along the shoreboxes
barrels and crates Five or six men had rolled a whisky barrel beyond
the reach of the water had broached it and now were drinking in turn
from a broken and dingy fragment of a beerschooner They were very
dirty their hair had fallen over their eyes which were bloodshot
the expression of their faces was imbecile As the phaeton passed they
hailed its occupants in thick voices shouting against the wind maudlin
invitations to drink

The crowd gathered at the pier comprised fully half the population of
Monrovia It centred about the life saving crew whose mortar was
being loaded A stovein lifeboat mutely attested the failure of other
efforts The men worked busily ramming home the powder sack placing
the projectile with the light line attached attending that the reel ran
freely Their chief watched the seas and winds through his glasses When
the preparations were finished he adjusted the mortar and pulled
the string Carroll had seen this done in practice Now with the
recollection of that experience in mind she was astonished at the
feeble report of the piece and its freedom from the dense white clouds
of smoke that should have enveloped it The wind snatched both noise and
vapour away almost as soon as they were born The dart with its trailer
of line rose on a long graceful curve The reel sang Every member of
the crowd unconsciously leaned forward in attention But the resistance
of the wind and the line early made itself felt Slower and slower
hummed the reel There came a time when the missile seemed to hesitate
then fairly to stand in equilibrium Finally in an increasingly abrupt
curve it descended into the sea By a good three hundred yards the shot
had failed to carry the line over the vessels

Theres Mr Bradford said Carroll waving her hand I wish hed come
and tell us something about it

The banjoplaying village Brummell saw the signal and came his face
grave

Couldnt they get the lifeboats out to them asked Carroll as he
approached

You see that one said Bradford pointing Well the others in
kindling wood farther up the beach

Anybody drowned asked Mina quickly

No we got em out Mr Cams shoulder is broken He glanced down at
himself comically and the girls for the first time noticed that beneath
the heavy overcoat his garments were dripping

But surely theyll never get a line over with the mortar said
Carroll That last shot fell so far short

They know it Theyve shot a dozen times Might as well do something

I should think said Mina that theyd shoot from the end of the
pier Theyd be ever so much nearer

Tried it replied Bradford succinctly Nearly lost the whole
business

Nobody said anything for some time but all looked helplessly to where
the vesselsfrom this elevation insignificant among the tumbling
waterswere pounding to pieces

At this moment from the river a trail of black smoke became visible over
the point of sandhill that ran down to the pier A smokestack darted
into view slowed down and came to rest well inside the riverchannel
There it rose and fell regularly under the influence of the swell that
swung in from the lake The crowd uttered a cheer and streamed in the
direction of the smokestack

Come and see whats up suggested Bradford

He hitched Prince to a log sticking up at an angle from the sand and
led the way to the pier

There they had difficulty in getting close enough to see but Bradford
preceding the two women succeeded by patience and diplomacy in forcing
a way The SPRITE was lying close under the pier the top of her
pilothouse just about level with the feet of the people watching
her She rose and fell with the restless waters Fat ropeyarn bumpers
interposed between her sides and the piling The pilothouse was empty
but Harvey the negro engineer leaned elbows crossed against the sill
of his little square door smoking his pipe

I wouldnt go out there for a million dollars cried a man excitedly
to Carroll and Bradford Nothing on earth could live in that sea
Nothing Ive run a tug myself in my time and I know what Im talking
about

What are they going to do asked Carroll

Havent you heard cried the other turning to her Where you been
This is one of Ordes tugs and shes going to try to get a line to them
vessels But I wouldnt

Bradford did not wait for him to finish He turned abruptly and with an
air of authority brushed toward the tug followed closely by Carroll and
Mina At the edge of the pier was the tugs captain Marsh listening
to earnest expostulation by a halfdozen of the leading men of the town
among whom were both Newmark and Orde

As the three came within earshot Captain Marsh spit forth the stump of
cigar he had been chewing

Gentlemen said he crisply that isnt the question I think I can
do it and Im entirely willing to take all personal risks The thing is
hazardous and its Mr Ordes tug Its for him to say whether he wants
to risk her

Good Lord man whats the tug in a case like this cried Orde
who was standing near Carroll looked at him proudly but she did not
attempt to make her presence known

I thought so replied Captain Marsh So its settled Ill take her
out if I can get a crew Harvey step up here

The engineer slowly hoisted his long figure through the breasthigh
doorway dragged his legs under him then with extraordinary agility
swung to the pier his teeth shining like ivory in his black face

Yas suh said he

Harvey said Captain Marsh briskly were going to try to get a line
aboard those vessels out there Its dangerous You dont have to go if
you dont want to Will you go

Harvey removed his cap and scratched his wool The grin faded from his
goodnatured countenance

Youall goin suh he asked

Of course

I reckon Ill done haif to go too said Harvey simply Without
further word he swung lightly back to the uneasy craft below him and
began to toss the slabs from the deck into the hold

I want a man with me at the wheel two to handle the lines and one to
fire for Harvey said Captain Marsh to the crowd in general

Thats our job announced the lifesaving captain

Well come on then No use in delay said Captain Marsh

The four men from the lifesaving service dropped aboard The five then
went over the tug from stem to stern tossing aside all movables
and lashing tight all essentials From the pilothouse Captain Marsh
distributed life preservers Harvey declined his

Whaffor I want dat he inquired Lots of good he gwine do me down
here

Then all hatches were battened down Captain Marsh reached up to shake
the hand which Orde stooping offered him

Ill try to bring her back all right sir said he

To hell with the tug cried Orde impatient at this insistence on the
mere property aspect Bring yourself back

Captain Marsh deliberately lit another cigar and entered the pilothouse
with the other men

Cast off he cried and the silent crowd heard clearly the single
sharp bell ringing for attention and then the jangler that called for
full speed ahead Awed they watched the tiny sturdy craft move out into
the stream and point to the fury of the open lake

Brave chaps Brave chaps said Dr McMullen to Carroll as they turned
away The physician drew his tall slender figure to its height Brave
chaps every one of them But do you know to my mind the bravest of
them all are that niggerand his firemannailed down in the hold where
they cant see nor know whats going on and ifif the good doctor
blew his nose vigorously five or six timeswell its just like a rat
in a hole He shook his head vigorously and looked out to sea I read
last evening sir said he to Bradford in a blasted fool medical
journal I take that the race is degenerating Good God

The tug had rounded the end of the pier The first of her thousand
enemies sweeping in from the open had struck her fair A great sheet
of white water slanting back and up shot with terrific impact against
the house and beyond For an instant the little craft seemed buried
but almost immediately the gleam of her black hull showed her plunging
forward dauntlessly

Thats nothin said the tug captain who had first spoken Wait til
she gets outside The watchers streamed down from the pier for a better
view Carroll and Miss Heinzman followed They saw the staunch little
craft drive into three big seas each of which appeared to bury her
completely save for her upper works She managed however to keep her
headway

She can stand that all right said one of the lifesaving crew who
had been watching her critically The trouble will come when she drops
down to the vessels

In spite of the heavy smashing of headon seas the SPRITE held her
course straight out

Wheres she going anyway marvelled little Mr Smith the stationer
Shes away beyond the wrecks already

Probably Marsh has found the seas heavier than he thought and is afraid
to turn her broadside guessed his companion

Afraid hell snorted a riverman who overheard

Nevertheless the SPRITE was now so distant that the loom of the great
seas on the horizon swallowed her from view save when she rose on the
crest of some mighty billow

Well what is he doing way out there then challenged Mr Smiths
friend with some asperity

Dono replied the riverman but whatever it is its all right as
long as Buck Marsh is at the wheel

There shes turned now Mr Smith interposed

Beneath the trail of black smoke she had shifted direction And then
with startling swiftness the SPRITE darted out of the horizon into full
view For the first time the spectators realised the size and weight of
the seas Not even the sullen pounding to pieces of the vessels on the
bar had so impressed them as the sight of the tug coasting with railroad
speed down the rush of a comber like a childs toyboat in the surf One
moment the whole of her deck was visible as she was borne with the wave
the next her bow alone showed high as the back suction caught her and
dragged her from the crest into the hollow A sea rose behind Nothing
of the tug was to be seen It seemed that no power or skill could
prevent her feeling overwhelmed Yet somehow always she staggered out
of the gulf until she caught the force of the billow and was again cast
forward like a chip

Maybe they aint catchin pticular hell at that wheel to hold her from
yawing muttered the tug captain to his neighbour who happened to be
Mr Duncan the minister

Almost before Carroll had time to see that the little craft was coming
in she had arrived at the outer line of breakers Here the combers
dragged by the bar underneath crested curled over and fell with a
roar just as in milder weather the surf breaks on the beach When the
SPRITE rushed at this outer line of whitewater a woman in the crowd
screamed

But at the edge of destruction the SPRITE came to a shuddering stop Her
powerful propellers had been set to the reverse They could not hold
her against the forward fling of the water but what she lost thus she
regained on the seaward slopes of the waves and in their hollows Thus
she hovered on the edge of the breakers awaiting her chance

As long as the seas rolled in steadily and nothing broke she was safe
But if one of the waves should happen to crest and break as many of
them did the weight of water catching the tug on her flat broad stern
deck would indubitably bury her The situation was awful in its extreme
simplicity Would Captain Marsh see his opportunity before the law of
chances would bring along the wave that would overwhelm him

A realisation of the crisis came to the crowd on the beach At once
the terrible strain of suspense tugged at their souls Each conducted
himself according to his nature The hardy men of the river and
the woods set their teeth until the cheek muscles turned white and
blasphemed softly and steadily Two or three of the townsmen walked up
and down the space of a dozen feet One the woman who had screamed
prayed aloud in short hysterical sentences

O God Save them O Lord O Lord

Orde stood on top of a halfburied log his hat in his hand his
entire being concentrated on the manoeuvre being executed Only Newmark
apparently remained as calm as ever leaning against an upright timber
his arms folded and an unlighted cigar as usual between his lips

Methodically every few moments he removed his eyeglasses and wiped the
lenses free of spray

Suddenly without warning occurred one of those inexplicable lulls that
interpose often amid the wildest uproars For the briefest instant other
sounds than the roar of the wind and surf were permitted the multitude
on the beach They heard the grinding of timbers from the stricken
ships and the draining away of waters And distinctly they heard the
faint far tinkle of the jangler calling again for full speed ahead

Between two waves the SPRITE darted forward directly for the nearest of
the wrecks Straight as an arrows flight she held until from the crowd
went up a groan

Shell collide some one put it into words

But at the latest moment the tug swerved raced past and turned on a
long diagonal across the end of the bar toward the piers

Captain Marsh had chosen his moment with exactitude To the utmost he
had taken advantage of the brief lull of jumbled seas after the three
largest waves had swept by Yet in shallow water and with the strong
inshore set even that lull was all too short The SPRITE was staggered
by the buffets of the smaller breakers her speed was checked her stern
was dragged around For an instant it seemed that the back suction would
hold her in its grip She tore herself from the grasp of the current
Enveloped in a blinding hail of spray she struggled desperately to
extricate herself from the maelstrom in which she was involved before
the resumption of the larger seas should roll her over and over to
destruction

Already these larger seas were racing in from the open To Carroll
watching breathless and wideeyed in that strange passive and receptive
state peculiar to imaginative natures they seemed alive And the
SPRITE too appeared to be not a fabric and a mechanism controlled by
men but a sentient creature struggling gallantly on her own volition

Far out in the lake against the tumbling horizon she saw heave up for
a second the shoulder of a mighty wave And instinctively she perceived
this wave as a deadly enemy of the little tug and saw it bending all
its great energies to hurrying in on time to catch the victim before it
could escape To this wave she gave all her attention watching for
it after it had sunk momentarily below its fellows recognising it
instantly as it rose again The spasms of dismay and relief among the
crowd about her she did not share at all The crises they indicated did
not exist for her Until the wave came in Carroll knew the SPRITE
no matter how battered and tossed would be safe Her whole being was
concentrated in a continually shifting calculation of the respective
distances between the tug and the piers the tug and the relentlessly
advancing wave

Oh go she exhorted the SPRITE under her breath

Then the crowd too caught with its slower perceptions the import
of the wave Carroll felt the electric thrill of apprehension shiver
through it Huge and towering green and flecked with foam the wave came
on now calmly and deliberately as though sure The SPRITE was off the
end of the pier when the wave lifted her just in the position her enemy
would have selected to crush her life out against the cribs Slowly the
tug rose against its shoulder was lifted onward poised and then
with a swift forward thrust the wave broke smothering the pier and
lighthouse beneath tons of water

A low agonised wail broke from the crowd And thenand thenover
beyond the pier down which the wave broken and spent but formidable
still was ripping its way they saw gliding a battered black stack from
which still poured defiantly clouds of gray smoke

For ten seconds the spectators could not believe their eyes They had
distinctly seen the SPRITE caught between a resistless wall of water
and the pier where she should have been crushed like the proverbial
eggshell Yet there she wasor her ghost

Then a great cheer rose up against the wind The crowd went crazy Mere
acquaintances hugged each other and danced around and around through
the heavy sands Several women had hysterics The riverman next to Mr
Duncan opened his mouth and swore so picturesquely that as he afterward
told his chum I mustve been plumb inspired for the occasion Yet it
never entered Mr Duncans ministerial head to reprove the blasphemy
Orde jumped down from his halfburied log and clapped his hat on his
head Newmark did not alter his attitude nor his expression

The SPRITE was safe For the few moments before she glided the length of
the long pier to stiller water this fact sufficed

I wonder if she got the line aboard speculated the tugboat captain
at last

The crowd surged over to the piers again Below them rose and fell the
SPRITE All the fancy scrollwork of her upper works the cornice of her
deck house the light rigging of her cabin had disappeared leaving raw
and splintered wood to mark their attachments The tall smokestack
was bent awry but its supports had held which was fortunate since
otherwise the fires would have been drowned out At the moment Captain
Marsh was bending over examining a bad break in the overhangthe only
material damage the tug had sustained

At sight of him the crowd set up a yell He paid no attention One of
the lifesaving men tossed a mooring line ashore It was seized by a
dozen men Then for the first time somebody noticed that although the
tug had come to a standstill her screw was still turning slowly over
and over holding her against the erratic strong jerking of a slender
rope that ran through her stern chocks and into the water

He got it aboard yelled the man pointing

Another cheer broke out The lifesaving crew leaped to the deck
They were immediately followed by a crowd of enthusiasts eager to
congratulate and question But Captain Marsh would have none of them

Get off my tug he shouted Do you want to swamp her What do you
suppose we put that line aboard for Fun Get busy and use it Rescue
that crew now

Abashed the enthusiasts scrambled back The lifesaving crew took
charge It was necessary to pass the line around the end of the pier
and back to the beach This was a dangerous job and one requiring
considerable power and ingenuity for the strain on the line imposed
by the waters was terrific and the breaking seas rendered work on the
piers extremely hazardous However the lifesaving captain took charge
confidently enough His crew began to struggle out the pier while
volunteers under his personal direction manipulated the reel

A number of the curious lingered about the SPRITE Marsh and Orde were
in consultation over the smashed stern and did not look as though they
cared to be disturbed Harvey leaned out his little square door

Don know nuffin bout it said he ceptin she done rolled way
over bout foh times Yass she did suh I know I felt her doin it

No he answered a query I wasnt what youall would call scairt
that is not really SCAIRTjess a little nevous All I had to do was
to feed her slabs and listen foh my bell You see Capn Mash he was
in chage

No sir Captain Marsh was saying emphatically to his employer
I cant figure it out except on one thing You see its stove from
UNDERNEATH A sea would have smashed it from above

Perhaps you grounded in between seas out there suggested Orde

Marsh smiled grimly

I reckon Id have known it said he No sir It sounds wild but
its the only possible guess That last sea mustve lifted us bodily
right over the corner of the pier

Wellmaybe assented Orde doubtfully

Sure thing repeated Marsh with conviction

Well youd better not tell em so unless you want to rank in with Old
Man Ananias ended Orde It was a good job Pretty dusty out there
wasnt it

Pretty dusty grinned Marsh

They turned away together and were at once pounced on by Leopold Lincoln
Bunn the local reporter a callow youth aflame with the chance for a
big story of more than local interest

Oh Captain Marsh he cried How did you get around the pier It
looked as though the wave had you caught

Orde glanced at his companion in curiosity

On roller skates replied Marsh

Leopold tittered nervously

Could you tell me how you felt when you were out there in the worst of
it he inquired

Oh hell said Marsh grumpily stalking away

Dont interview for a cent does he grinned Orde

Oh Mr Orde Perhaps you

Dont you think wed better lend a hand below suggested Orde
pointing to the beach

The wild and picturesque work of rescue was under way The line had
been successfully brought to the left of the lighthouse To it had been
attached the rope and to that the heavy cable These the crew of the
schooner had dragged out and made fast to a mast The shore end passed
over a tall scissors When the cable was tightened the breeches buoy was
put into commission and before long the first member of the crew was
hauled ashore plunging in and out of the waves as the rope tightened or
slackened He was a flaxenhaired Norwegian who stamped his feet shook
his body and grinned comically at those about him He accepted with
equanimity a dozen drinks of whisky thrust at him from all sides
swigged a mug of the coffee a few practical women were making over
an open fire and opposed to Leopold Lincoln Bunns frantic efforts a
stolid and baffling density Of none of these attentions did he seem to
stand in especial need

The crew and its volunteers worked quickly When the last man had come
ashore the captain of the lifesaving service entered the breeches buoy
and caused himself to be hauled through the smother to the wreck After
an interval a signal jerked back The buoy was pulled in empty and the
surf car substituted In it were piled various utensils of equipment
One man went with it and several more on its next trip until nearly
the whole crew were aboard the wreck

Carroll and Mina stayed until dusk and after watching the long heavy
labour of rescue Lines had to be rocketed from the schooner to the
other vessels Then by their means cable communication had to be
established with the shore After this it was really a matter of routine
to run the crew to the beach though cruel hard work and dangerous
The wrecks were continually swept by the great seas and at any moment
the tortured fabrics might give way might dissolve completely in the
elements that so battered them The women making the hot coffee found
their services becoming valuable Big fires of driftwood were ignited
They were useful for light as well as warmth

By their illumination finally Orde discovered the two girls standing
and paused long enough in his own heavy labour of assistance to draw
Carroll one side

Youd better go home now sweetheart said he Bobbyll be waiting
for you and the girls may be here in the crowd somewhere Therell be
nobody to take care of him

I suppose so she assented But hasnt it been exciting Whose
vessels were they do you know

Orde glanced at her strangely

They were ours said he

She looked up at him catching quickly the wrinkles of his brow and the
harassed anxiety in his eyes Impulsively she pulled him down to her and
kissed him

Never mind dear said she I care only if you do

She patted his great shoulders lightly and smiled up at him

Run help she cried And come home as soon as you can Ill have
something nice and hot all ready for you

She turned away the smile still on her lips but as soon as she was out
of sight her face fell grave

Come Mina she said to the younger girl Time to go

They toiled through the heavy sand to where hours ago they had left
Prince That faithful animal dozed in his tracks and awoke reluctantly

Carroll looked back The fires leaped red and yellow Against them
were the silhouettes of people and in the farther circle of their
illumination were more people cast in bronze that flickered red In
contrast to their glow the night was very dark Only from the lake there
disengaged a faint gray light where the waters broke The strength of
the failing wind still lifted the finer particles of sand The organ of
the pounding surf filled the night with the grandeur of its music

Orde mounted the office stairs next day with a very heavy step The loss
of the NORTH STAR and of the two schooners meant a great deal to him at
that time

It kicks us into somewhat of a hole he grumbled to Newmark

A loss is never pleasant replied the latter and it puts us out of
the carrying business for awhile But were insured

I cant understand why Floyd started said Orde He ought to know
better than to face sure prospects of a fall blow Ill tan his soul for
that all right

Im afraid Im partly responsible for his going put in Newmark

You cried Orde

Yes You see that Smith and Mabley shipment was important enough
to strain a point forand its only twentyfour hours or soand it
certainly didnt look to see me as if it were going to blow very soon
Poor Floyd feels bad enough Hes about sick

Orde for the first time began to appreciate the pressure of his
circumstances The loss on the cargo of uppers reached about 8000000
feet which represented 20000 in money As for the NORTH STAR and her
consorts save for the insurance they were simply eliminated They had
represented property Now they were gone The loss of 60000 or so on
them however did not mean a diminution of the companys present cash
resources to that amount and so did not immediately affect Ordes
calculations as to the payment of the notes which were now soon to come
due

At this time the woods work increasingly demanded his attention
He disappeared for a week his organising abilities claimed for the
distribution of the road crews When he returned to the office Newmark
with an air of small triumph showed him contracts for the construction
of three new vessels

I get them for 55000 said he with 30000 of it on long time

Without consulting me cried Orde

Newmark explained carefully that the action seemingly so abrupt had
really been taking advantage of a lucky opportunity

Otherwise he finished we shouldnt have been able to get the
job done for another year at least If that big Cronin contract goes
throughwell you know what that would mean in the shipyardsnobody
would get even a lookin And McLeod is willing in the meantime to
give us a price to keep his men busy So you see I had to close at once
You can see what a short chance it was

Its a good chance all right admitted Orde butwhythat is
I thought perhaps wed job our own freighting for awhileit never
occurred to me wed build any more vessels until wed recovered a
little

Recovered Newmark repeated coldly I dont see what recovered has
to do with it If the mill burned down wed rebuild wouldnt we Even
if we were embarrassedwhich were notwed hardly care to acknowledge
publicly that we couldnt keep up our equipment And as were making
twelve or fifteen thousand a year out of our freighting it seems to me
too good a business to let slip into other hands

I suppose so agreed Orde a trifle helplessly

Therefore I had to act without you Newmark finished I knew youd
agree Thats right isnt it he insisted

Yes thats right agreed Orde drearily

Youll find copies of the contract on your desk Newmark closed the
matter And theres the tax lists I wish youd run them over

Joe replied Orde II dont think Ill stay down town this morning
I

Newmark glanced up keenly

You dont look a bit well said he kind of pale around the gills
Bilious Dont believe that camp grub quite agrees with you for a steady
diet

Yes that must be it assented Orde

He closed his desk and went out Newmark turned back to his papers His
face was expressionless From an inner pocket he produced a cigar which
he thrust between his teeth The corners of his mouth slowly curved in a
grim smile

Orde did not go home Instead he walked down Main Street to the docks
where he jumped into a rowboat lying in a slip and with a few rapid
strokes shot out on the stream In his younger days he had belonged to
a boat club and had rowed in the four He still loved the oar and
though his racing days were past he maintained a cleanlined rather
unstable little craft which it was his delight to propel rapidly with
long spoonoars whenever he needed exercise Today however he was
content to drift

The morning was still and golden The crispness of late fall had infused
a wine into the air The sky was a soft bluegray the sandhills
were a dazzling yellow Orde did not try to think he merely faced the
situation staring it in the face until it should shrink to its true
significance

One thing he felt distinctly yet could not without a struggle bring
himself to see The California lands must be mortgaged If he could
raise a reasonable sum of money on them he would still be perfectly
able to meet his notes He hated fiercely to raise that money

It was entirely a matter of sentiment Orde realised the fact clearly
and browbeat his other self with a savage contempt Nevertheless his
dream had been to keep the western timber free and unencumberedfor
Bobby Dreams are harder to give up than realities

He fell into the deepest reflections which were broken only when the
pounding of surf warned him he had drifted almost to the open lake
After all there was no essential difference between owing money to a
man in Michigan and to a man in California That was the net result of
his struggle

When the time comes well just borrow that money on a longtime
mortgage like sensible people he said aloud and quit this
everlasting scrabbling

Back to town he pulled with long vigorous strokes skittering his
feathered spoonoars lightly over the tops of the wavelets At the slip
he made fast the boat and a few minutes later reentered the office
his step springy his face glowing Newmark glanced up

Hullo said he Back again You look better

Exercise said Orde in his hearty manner Exercise old boy You
ought to try it Greatest thing in the world Just took a row to the end
of the piers and back and Im as fit as a fiddle




XXXVI


Orde immediately set into motion the machinery of banking to borrow on
the California timber Taylor took charge of this as the only man in
Monrovia who had Ordes confidence At the end of a necessary delay Orde
received notice that the West had been heard from He stepped across the
hall to the lawyers office

Well Frank said he glad we managed to push it through with so
little trouble

Taylor arose shut carefully the door into his outer office walked
to the window looked contemplatively out upon the hotel backyard and
returned to his desk

But there is trouble said he curtly

Whats the matter asked Orde

The banks refuse the loan

Orde stared at him in blank astonishment

Refuse he echoed

Absolutely

What grounds can they possibly have for that

I cant make out exactly from these advices Its something about the
title

But I thought you went over the title

I did stated Taylor emphatically and Ill stake my reputation as
a lawyer that everything is straight and clear from the Land Office
itself Ive wired for an explanation and we ought surely to know
something definite by tomorrow

With this uncertainty Orde was forced to be content For the first time
in his business career a real anxiety gnawed at his vitals He had been
in many tight places but somehow heretofore success or failure had
seemed to him about immaterial like points gained or conceded in the
game a fresh start was always so easy and what had been already won as
yet unreal Now the game itself was at issue Property reputation and
the familys future were at stake When the three had lived in the tiny
house by the church it had seemed that no adversity could touch them
But now that long use had accustomed them to larger quarters servants
luxuries Orde could not conceive the possibility of Carrolls ever
returning to that simplest existence Carroll could have told him
otherwise but of course he did not as yet bring the possibility before
her She had economised closely these last few years Orde was proud
of her He was also fiercely resentful that his own foolishness or
untoward circumstances or a combination of both should jeopardise her
future Therefore he awaited further news with the greatest impatience

The message came the following day as Taylor had predicted Taylor
handed it to him without comment

Land Office under investigation Orde read Fraudulent entries
suspected All titles clouded until decision is reached

What do you suppose that means asked Orde although he knew well
enough

Taylor glanced up at his dull eyes with commiseration

They simply wont lend good money on an uncertainty said he

Frank said Orde rousing himself with an effort Ive got to be
here I couldnt get away this winter if my life depended on it And I
wont even have time to pay much attention to it from here I want you
to go to California and look after those interests for me Never mind
your practice man as Taylor tried to interrupt him Make what
arrangements you please but go Itll be like a sort of vacation to
you You need one And Ill make it worth your while Take Clara
with you Shell like California Now dont say no Its important
Straighten it out as quick as you can and the minute it IS straight
borrow that money on it and send it on pdq

Taylor thoughtfully tapped his palm with the edge of his eyeglasses

All right he said at last

Good cried Orde rising and holding out his hand

He descended the dark stairs to the street where he turned down toward
the river There he sat on a pile for nearly an hour quite oblivious to
the keen wind of latter November which swept up over the scum ice from
the Lake At length he hopped down and made his way to the office of the
Welton Lumber Co

Look here Welton he demanded abruptly when he had reached that
operators private office how much of a cut are you going to make this
year

About twenty million replied Welton Why

Just figuring on the drive said Orde nodding a farewell

He had the team harnessed and assuming his buffalofur coat drove to
the offices of all the men owning timber up and down the river When he
had collected his statistics he returned to his desk where he filled
the backs of several envelopes with his characteristically minute
figures At the close of his calculations he nodded his head vigorously
several times

Joe he called across to his partner Im going to cut that whole
forty million we have left

Newmark did not turn After a moment his dry expressionless voice came
back

I thought that we figured that as a twoyears job

We did but Im going to clean up the whole thing this year

Do you think you can do it

Sure thing replied Orde Then under his breath and quite to himself
he added Ive got to

The duel had now come to grapples Orde was fighting for his very life
The notes given by Newmark and Orde would come due by the beginning of
the following summer Before that time Orde must be able to meet them
personally or as by the agreement with Newmark his stock in the Boom
Company would be turned in to the firm This would of course spell
nearly a total loss of it as far as Orde was concerned

The chief anxiety under which the riverman laboured however was
the imminent prospect of losing under the mortgage all the Northern
Peninsula timber He had thought that the firm would be able to step in
for its redemption even if he personally found himself unable to
meet the obligation Three hundred million feet would seem to be too
important a matter to let go under so small a mortgage Now as the time
approached he realised that if he could not pay the notes the firm
would certainly be unable to do so What with the second mortgage
due two years later and to be met by Newmark with the outstanding
obligations with the new enterprise of the vessels ordered from Duncan
McLeod Newmark and Orde would be unable to raise anything like the
necessary amount To his personal anxieties Orde added a deep and bitter
selfreproach at having involved his partner in what amounted to a total
loss

Spurred doubly by these considerations then he fell upon the woods
work with unparalleled ferocity A cut and sale of the forty million
feet remaining of the firms upriver holdings together with the tolls
to be collected for driving the river that spring would if everything
went right and no change in the situation took place bring Orde through
the venture almost literally by the skin of his teeth To cut forty
million feet even in these latter days of improvements then unknown
would be a task to strain to the utmost every resource of energy
pluck equipment and organisation In 188081 the operators on the river
laughed goodhumouredly over an evident madness

Nevertheless Orde accomplished the task To be sure he was largely
helped by a favourable winter The cold weather came early and continued
late Freezing preceded the snow which was deep enough for good
travoying and to assure abundant freshet water in the spring but not
too deep to interfere with the work Orde increased his woods force
and contrary to his custom he drove them mercilessly He was that
winter his own walkingboss and lived constantly in the woods The
Rough Red had charge of the banking where his aggressive brutal
personality kept the rollways free from congestion For congestion there
means delay in unloading the sleighs and that in turn means a drag in
the woods work near the skidways at the other end of the line Tom North
and Tim Nolan and Johnny Sims and Jim Denning were foremen back in the
forest Every one had an idea more or less vague that the Old Fellow
had his back to the wall Late into the night the rude torches made
quite simply from brown stone jugs full of oil and with wicks in their
necks cast their flickering glare over the ice of the haulroads And
though generally in that part of Michigan the thaws begin by the first
or second week in March this year zero weather continued even to the
eighth of April When the drive started far up toward headwaters the
cut was banked for miles along the stream forty million feet of it to
the last timber

The strain over Orde slept the clock around and awoke to the further
but familiar task of driving the river He was very tired but his
spirit was at peace As always after the event he looked back on his
anxieties with a faint amusement over their futility

From Taylor he had several communications The lawyer confessed himself
baffled as to the purpose and basis of the Land Office investigation
The whole affair appeared to be tangled in a maze of technicalities and
a snarl of redtape which it would take some time to unravel In the
meantime Taylor was enjoying himself and was almost extravagant in his
delight over the climate and attractions of Southern California

Orde did not much care for this delay He saw his way clear to meeting
his obligations without the necessity of hypothecating the California
timber and was the better pleased for it With the breakup of spring
he started confidently with the largest drive in the history of the
river a matter of over two hundred million feet

This tremendous mass of timber moved practically in three sections The
first and smallest comprised probably thirty millions It started
from the lowermost rollways on the river drove rapidly through the
more unobstructed reaches and was early pocketed above Monrovia in
the Companys distributing booms The second and largest section of a
hundred million came from the main river and its largest tributaries It
too made a safe drive and was brought to rest in the main booms and in
a series of temporary or emergency booms built along the right bank and
upstream from the main works The third section containing a remainder
of about seventy million had by the twentysixth of June reached the
slack water above the city of Redding




XXXVIII


The morning of June twentysixth dawned clear Orde was early on the
road before the heat of the day He drove his buckboard rapidly over the
twelve miles that separated his home from the distributing booms for he
wanted at once to avoid the heat of the first sun and to arrive at the
commencement of the days work After a glance at the river he entered
the tiny office and set about the examination of the tally sheets left
by the foreman While he was engaged in this checking the foreman Tom
North entered

The rivers rising a little he remarked conversationally as he
reached for the second set of tally boards

Youre crazy muttered Orde without looking up Its clear as a
bell and there have been no rains reported from anywhere

Its rising a little just the same insisted North going out

An hour later Orde having finished his clerical work walked out over
the booms The water certainly had risen and considerably at that A
decided current sucked through the interstices in the piling The penned
logs moved uneasily

I should think it was rising said Orde to himself as he watched the
slowly moving water I wonder whats up It cant be merely those rains
three days ago

He called one of the younger boys to him Jimmy Powers by name

Here Jimmy said he mark one of these piles and keep track of how
fast the water rises

For some time the river remained stationary then resumed its slow
increase Orde shook his head

I dont like June floods he told Tom North A fellow can understand
an ordinary spring freshet and knows about how far it will go but
these summer floods are so confounded mysterious I cant figure out
whats struck the old stream unless theyre having almighty heavy rains
up near headwaters

By three oclock in the afternoon Jimmy Powers reported a rise since
morning of six inches The current had proportionately increased in
power

Tom said Orde to the old riverman Im going to send Marsh down for
the piledrivers and some cable The barge company has some fifteen inch
manilla

North laughed

What in blazes do you expect to do with that he inquired

We may need them Orde stated with conviction Everythings safe
enough now and probably will continue so but I cant afford to take
chances If those logs ever break through theyll go on out to Lake
Michigan and there they wouldnt be worth the salvage

Tom North stared at his principal in surprise

Thats a mighty long chance he commented Never knew you to come so
near croaking before Jack

If this drive goes out it surely busts me replied Orde and Im not
taking even long chances

Captain Marsh returning with the SPRITE brought an evening paper
and news from the telegraph offices A cloudburst in the China Creek
district followed by continued heavy rains was responsible for the
increased water The papers mentioned this only incidentally and in
explanation Their columns were filled with an account of the big log
jam that had formed above the iron railroad bridge The planing mills
booms had given way under pressure and the contents had piled down
stream against the buttresses Before steps could be taken to clear the
way the head of the drive hurried by the excess water had piled in on
top Immediately a jam formed increasing in weight each moment until
practically the entire third section had piled up back of the bridge

The papers occupied themselves with the picturesque side of the affair
None expressed any anxiety as to the bridge It was a new structure
each of whose bents weighed over a hundred tons A fall of a few inches
only would suffice to lock the jam solidly thus relieving whatever
pressure the mass exerted against the iron bridge That the water would
shortly go down was of course inevitable at this time of year It would
be a big jam for the rivermen to break however

Do you think youll go up there asked North

Orde shook his head

Theyre in a nice pickle he acknowledged but Nolans in charge and
will do his best I think we may have troubles of our own right here at
home

He slept that night at the booms The water contrary to all
expectation rose steadily By morning it had crept so far up the piles
that there began to be danger that it would overflow their tops In that
case of course the logs in the booms would also run out

Guess its time we did a little work remarked Orde

He set a crew of men to raising the height of the piling by tying logs
firmly to the bolted timbers atop This would take care of an extra
two feet of water a two feet beyond all previous records Another crew
stretched the fifteen inch manilla cables across the field of logs in
order to segregate them into several units of mass and so prevent them
from piling up at the downstream end of the enclosure The piledriver
began to drop its hammer at spots of weakness In spite of the
accelerated current and the increased volume of the river everything
was soon shipshape and safe

Were all right now said Orde The only thing Im a little uneasy
about is those confounded temporary booms upstream Still theyre all
right unless they get to piling up Then well have to see what we can
do to hold them I think as soon as the driver is through down at the
sorting end shed better drive a few clumps of piles to strengthen the
swing when it is shut Then if the logs pile down on us from above we
can hold them there

About two hours later the piledriver moved up The swing was opened
and the men began to drive clumps of piles in such a position as to
strengthen the swing when the latter should be shut It was a slow
job Each pile had to be taken from the raft at the stern of the scow
erected in the carrier and pounded into place by the heavy hammer
raised and let drop in the derrick at the bow

Long before the task was finished the logs in the temporary booms had
begun to slide atop one another to cross and tangle until at last
the river bed inside the booms was filled with a jam of formidable
dimensions From beneath it the water boiled in eddies Orde looking at
it roused himself to sudden activity

Get a move on he advised Captain Aspinwall of the driver If that
jam breaks on us we want to be ready and if it dont break before you
get this swing strengthened maybe we can hold her where she is Theres
no earthly doubt that those boom piles will never stand up when they get
the full pressure of the freshet

He departed up river on a tour of inspection from which he returned
almost immediately

Hurry up Hurry up he cried She cant last much longer

Indeed even to the men on the piledriver evidences of the pressure
sustained by the slender boom piles were not wanting Above the steady
gurgle of the water and the intermittent puffing and other noises of the
work they could hear a creaking and groaning of timbers full of portent
to those who could read the signs

The drivers crew laboured desperately hoisting the piles into the
carriage tripping the heavy hammer sending it aloft again binding
feverishly the clumps of piles together by means of cables Each man
worked with an eye over his shoulder fearful of the power that menaced
him

Two of the clumps had been placed and bound a third was nearly
finished when suddenly with a crack and a roar the upper booms gave
way projecting their logs upon the opening and the driver

The half dozen members of the crew caught utterly unaware in spite
of the half warning they had been receiving for an hour past were
scattered by the winds of a panic Two or three flung themselves on
their faces several ran from one end of the scow to the other one
leaped into the river Imminent destruction seemed upon them

Tom North at the winch that operated the arm of the swing however
retained his presence of mind At the first sag outward of the boom
piles he set in operation the machinery that closed the gate Clumsy and
slow as was his mechanism he nevertheless succeeded in getting the
long arm started The logs rushing in back of it hurried it shut
Immediately they jammed again and heaped up in a formidable tangle
behind the barrier Tom North his little black pipe between his teeth
stood calm the lever of his winch in his hand A short three feet from
the spot on which he stood the first saw log of the many that might
have overwhelmed him thrust forward its ugly head The wash of the water
lifted the huge piledriver bodily and deposited it with a crash half on
the bank and half in the water

Instantly after the first break Orde had commenced running out over the
booms from the shore

Good boy Tom he shot at North as he passed

Across the breast of the jam he hurried and to the other bank where
the piledriver lay The crew had recovered from their panic and were
ashore gazing curiously underneath the scow Captain Aspinwall examined
the supports of the derrick on deck

That was lucky said Orde briefly to Aspinwall Hows the damage
Stove you in

II dont think so replied the captain turning a rather perturbed
face to Orde

Thats good Ill send over the tug to help get her afloat Weve got
our work cut out for us now As soon as youre afloat blow your whistle
and Ill come over to tell you what to do

You dont expect me to work my driver under the face of that jam
cried the captain

Certainly snapped Orde wheeling

Not me said Aspinwall positively I know when Ive got enough

Whats the matter asked Orde

It isnt safe replied the captain and I dont intend to risk my men
or my driver

Orde stood for a moment stockstill then with a snort of anger he
leaped to the deck seized the man by the neck and thrust him bodily
over the side to the bank

Safe you whitelivered skunk he roared Safe Go over in the middle
of that tenacre lot and lie down on your face and see if you feel safe
there Get out the whole pack of you Im in charge here now

Captain Aspinwall picked himself up his face red with anger

Get off my driver he snarled Put that man off

Orde seized a short heavy bar

This driver is requisitioned said he Get out I havent time to
fool with you Ive got to save my logs

They hesitated and while they did so Tom North and some others of the
crew came running across the jam

Get a cable to the winch Orde shouted at these as soon as they were
within hearing And get Marsh up here with the SPRITE Weve got to get
afloat

He paid no more attention to the ejected crew The latter overawed
by the rivermen who now gathered in full force took the part of
spectators

A few minutes hard work put the driver afloat Fortunately its raft of
piles had not become detached in the upheaval

Tom said Orde briskly to North you know the piledriver business
Pick out your crew and take charge

In ten seconds of time the situation had changed from one of comparative
safety to one of extreme gravity The logs broken loose from the upper
temporary booms now jammed against the swing and against the other logs
already filling the main booms Already the pressure was beginning to
tell as the water banked up behind the mass The fifteeninch cables
tightened slowly but mightily some of the piles began to groan and rub
one against the other here and there a log deliberately upended above
the level

Orde took charge of the situation in its entirety as a general might
He set North immediately to driving clumps each of sixteen piles bound
to solidity by chains and so arranged in angles and slants as to direct
the enormous pressure toward either bank thus splitting the enemys
power The small driver owned by the Boom Company drove similar clumps
here there and everywhere that need arose or weakness developed
Seventyfive men opposed to the weight of twenty million tons of logs
and a river of water the expedients invented by determination and
desperation

As in a virulent disease the symptoms developed rapidly when once the
course of the malady was assured After the first rush when the upper
booms broke nothing spectacular occurred Steadily and relentlessly the
logs packed close together down to the very bed of the stream pressed
outward against the frail defences Orde soon found himself forced from
the consideration of definite plans of campaign He gave over formal
defences and threw his energies to saving the weak places which rapidly
developed By the most tremendous exertions he seemed but just able
to keep even So closely balanced was the equilibrium between the
improvisation of defence and the increase of pressure behind the jam
that it seemed as if even a moments breathing spell would bring the
deluge Piles quivered bent slowly outwardimmediately before the
logs behind them could stir the piledriver must do its work Back
and forth darted the SPRITE and her sistertug the SPRAY towing the
piledrivers or the strings of piles Under the frowning destruction
that a breath might loosen the crews had to do their work And if ever
that breath should come there would be no chance for escape Crushed
and buried the men and their craft alike would be borne with the
breaking jam to an unknown grave in the Lake Every man knew it

Darkness came No one stopped for food By the light of lanterns the
struggle went on doubly terrifying in the mystery of night By day
the men practised in such matters could at least judge of the
probabilities of a break At night they had to work blindly uncertain
at what moment the forces they could not see would cut loose to
overwhelm them

Morning found no change in the situation The water rose steadily
the logs grew more and more restive the defences weaker and more
inadequate Orde brought out steaming pails of coffee which the men
gulped down between moments No one thought of quitting They were afire
with the flame of combat and were set obstinately on winning even in
the face of odds About ten oclock they were reinforced by men from the
mills downstream The Owners of those mills had no mind to lose their
logs Another piledriver was also sent up from the Government work
Without this assistance the jam must surely have gone out Spectators
marvelled how it held as it did The mass seemed constantly to quiver
on the edge of motion Here and there over the surface of the jam single
logs could be seen popping suddenly into the air propelled as an apple
seed is projected from between a boys thumb and forefinger Some of
the fifteeninch cables stretched to the shore parted One which passed
once around an oak tree before reaching its shore anchorage actually
buried itself out of sight in the hard wood Bunches of piles bent
twisted or were cut off as though they had been but shocks of Indian
corn The current had become so swift that the tugs could not hold the
drivers against it and as a consequence before commencing operations
special mooring piles had to be driven Each minute threatened to bring
an end to the jam yet it held and without rest the dogged little
insects under its face toiled to gain an inch on the waters




XXXIX


All that day and the next night the fight was hand to hand without the
opportunity of a breathing space Then Orde bareheaded and dishevelled
strung to a high excitement but cool as a veteran under fire began to
be harassed by annoyances The piles provided for the drivers gave out
Newmark left ostensibly to purchase more He did not return Tom North
and Jim Denning their eyes burning deep in their heads for lack of
sleep came to Orde holding to him symbolically their empty hands

No more piles they said briefly

Get em said Orde with equal brevity Newmark will have enough here
shortly In the meantime get them

North and his friend disappeared taking with them the crews of the
drivers and the two tugs After an interval they returned towing small
rafts of the long timbers Orde did not make any inquiries nor until
days later did he see a copy of the newspaper telling how a lawless gang
of rivermen had driven away the railroad men and stolen the railroads
property These piles lasted five or six hours Tom North placed and
drove them accurately and deliberately quite unmindful of the constant
danger A cold fire seemed to consume the man inflaming his courage and
his dogged obstinacy Once a wing of the jam broke suddenly just as his
crew had placed a pile in the carrier The scow was picked up whirled
around carried bodily a hundred feet and deposited finally with a
crash The instant the craft steadied and even before any one could tell
whether or no the danger was past Tom cut loose the hammer and drove
that pile

I put you in that carrier to be DROVE he shouted viciously and
drove youll be if we ARE goin to hell

When the SPRAY shouldered the scow back to position that one pile
was left standing upright in the channel a monument to the blind
determination of the man

Fortunately the wing break carried with it but a few logs but it
sufficed to show if demonstration were needed what would happen if any
more serious break should occur

Orde was everywhere Long since he had lost his hat and over his
forehead and into his eyes the strands of his hair whipped tousled and
unkempt Miles and miles he travelled running along the tops of the
booms over the surface of the jam spying the weakening places and
hurrying to them a rescue He seemed tireless omnipresent alive to
every need It was as though his personality alone held in correlation
these struggling forces as though were he to relax for an instant his
effort they would burst forth with the explosion of longpent energies

Toward noon the piles gave out again

Where in HELL is Newmark exploded Orde and immediately was himself
again controlled and resourceful He sent North and a crew of men to
cut piles from standing timber in farm wood lots near the river

Haul them out with your winch said he If the owners object stand
them off with your peavies Get them anyway

About three of the afternoon the LUCY BELLE splattered up stream from
the village carrying an excursion to see the jam Captain Simpson
brought her as close in as possible The waves raised by her awkward
paddlewheel and her clumsy lines surged among the logs and piles Orde
looked on this with distrust

Go tell him to pull out of that he instructed Jimmy Powers The
confounded old fool ought to know better than that Tell him its
dangerous If the jam goes out itll carry him to Kingdom Come

Jimmy Powers returned redfaced from his interview

He told me to go to hell he said shortly

Oh he did snapped Orde I should think we had enough without that
old idiot

With the short nervous leaps of a suppressed anger he ran down to where
the SPRITE had just towed the Number One driver into a new position

Lay me alongside the LUCY BELLE he told Marsh

But Simpson in a position of importance at last was disinclined to
listen He had worn his blue clothes and brass buttons for a good many
years in charge only of boxes and barrels Now at a stroke he found
himself commander over tenscore people Likewise at fifty cents a head
he foresaw a good thing as long as high water should last He had risen
nobly to the occasion for he had even hoisted his bunting and brought
with him the local brass band Orde brusque in his desire to hurry
through an affair of minor importance rubbed the man the wrong way

I reckon Ive some rights on this river Captain Simpson concluded the
argument and I aint agoin to be bulldozed out of them

The excursionists typical trippers from Redding Holland Monrovia
and Muskegon cheered this sentiment and jeered at Orde

Orde nodded briefly

Marsh said he to his captain in a low voice get a crew and take
them in charge Run em off

As soon as the tug touched the piling he was off and away paying no
further attention to a matter already settled Captain Marsh called a
dozen rivermen to him laid the SPRITE alongside the LUCY BELLE and in
spite of Simpsons scandalised protests and an incipient panic among
the passengers thrust aside the regular crew of the steamship and
took charge Quite calmly he surveyed the scene From the height of the
steamers bridge he could see abroad over the country A warm June sun
flooded the landscape which was filled with the peace of early summer
The river seemed to flow smoothly and quietly enough in spite of the
swiftness of its current and the swollen volume of its waters Only up
stream where the big jam shrugged and groaned did any element jar on
the peace of the scene and even that in contrast to the rest of the
landscape afforded small hint to the inexperienced eye of the imminence
of a mighty destruction

Captain Marsh paid little attention to all this His eye swept rapidly
up and down where the banks used to be until he saw a cross current
deeper than the rest sweeping in athwart the inundated fields He swung
over the wheel and rang to the engineroom for half speed ahead Slowly
the LUCY BELLE answered Quite calmly Captain Marsh rammed her through
the opening and out over the cornfields The LUCY BELLE was a typical
river steamboat built light in the draught in order to slide over the
numerous shifting bars to be encountered in her customary business When
Captain Marsh saw that he had hit the opening he rang for full speed
and rammed the poor old LUCY BELLE hard aground in about a foot of water
through which a few mournful dried cornstalks were showing their heads
Then his hands in his pockets he sauntered out of the pilothouse to
the deck

Now if you want to picnic he told the astonished and frightened
excursionists go to it

With entire indifference to the water he vaulted over the low rail and
splashed away The rivermen and the engineer who had accompanied him
lingered only long enough to start up the band

Now youre safe as a cow tied to a brick wall said the Rough Red
whose appearance alone had gone far toward overawing the passengers Be
joyful Start up the music Start her up I tell you

The band hastily began to squawk very much out of time and somewhat
out of tune

Thats right grinned the Rough Red savagely keep her up If you
quit before I get back to work Ill come back and take you apart

They waded through the shallow water in the cornfield After them wafted
the rather disorganised strains of WHOA EMMA Captain Simpson was
indulging in what resembled heat apoplexy After a time the LUCY BELLES
crew recovered their scattered wits sufficiently to transport the
passengers in small boats to a point near the county road whence all
trudged to town The LUCY BELLE grew in the cornfield until several
weeks later when time was found to pull her off on rollers

Arrived at the booms Captain Marsh shook the loose water from his legs

All right sir he reported to Orde I ran em ashore yonder

Orde looked up brushing the hair from his eyes He glanced in the
direction of the cornfield and a quick grin flickered across the
absorbed expression of his face

I should think you did said he briefly I guess thatll end the
excursion business Now take Number Two up below the swing and then
run down and see if you can discover Tom He went somewhere after piles
about an hour ago

Down river the various mill owners were busy with what men they had left
in stringing defences across the river in case Ordes works should go
out When Orde heard this he swore vigourously

Crazy fools he spat out Theyd be a lot better off helping here If
this goes out their little booms wont amount to a whiff of wind

He sent word to that effect but lacking the enforcement of his
personal presence his messages did not carry conviction and the
panicstricken owners continued to labour each according to his ideas
on what Ordes clearer vision saw to be a series of almost comical
futilities However Welton answered the summons Orde hailed his coming
with a shout

I want a dredge he yelled as soon as the lumberman was within
distance I believe we can relieve the pressure somewhat by a channel
into Steams bayou Get that Government dredge up and through the bayou
as soon as you can

All right said Welton briefly Can you hold her

Ive got to hold her replied Orde between his clenched teeth Have
you seen Newmark Where in HELL is Newmark I need him for fifty things
and hes disappeared off the face of the earth Purdy that second
cable Shes snapped a strand Get a reinforcing line on her He ran in
the direction of the new danger without another thought of Welton

By the late afternoon casual spectators from the countryside had
gathered in some number The bolder or more curious of these added a
further touch of anxiety to the situation by clambering out over the jam
for a better view Orde issued instructions that these should keep off
the logs but in spite of that with the impertinent perseverance of the
sightseer many persisted from time to time when the rivermen were too
busily engaged to attend to them in venturing out where they were not
only in danger but also in the way Tom North would have none of this on
his piledriver If a man was not actually working he had no business
on Number One

But protested a spectator mildly I OWN this driver I havent
any objections to your grabbing her in this emergency even if you did
manhandle my captain but surely you are not going to keep me off my own
property

I dont give a tinkers damn who you are replied North sturdily If
youre not working you get off

And get off he did

The broad deck of the piledriver scow was a tempting point from which
to survey the work and the ugly jam and the water boiling angrily and
the holloweyed dishevelled maniacs who worked doggedly with set teeth
as though they had not already gone without two nights sleep North
had often to order ashore intruders until his temper shortened to
the vanishing point One big hulking countryman attempted to argue
the point North promptly knocked him overboard into the shallow water
between the driver and the bank He did not rise so North fished for
him in the most matteroffact way with a boat hook threw him on the
bank unconscious and went on driving piles The incident raised a laugh
among the men

But flesh and blood has its limit of endurance and that limit was
almost reached Orde heard the first premonitions of reaction in
the mild grumblings that arose He knew these men well from his long
experience with them Although the need for struggle against the
tireless dynamics of the river was as insistent as ever although it
seemed certain that a moments cessation of effort would permit the
enemy an irretrievable gain he called a halt on the whole work

Boys said he irrelevantly lets have a smoke

He set the example by throwing himself full length against a slanting
pile and most leisurely filling his pipe The men stared a moment
then followed his example A great peace of evening filled the sky The
horizon lay low and black against the afterglow Beneath it the river
shone like silver Only the groaning the heave and shrugging of the
jam and the low threatening gurgle of hurrying waters reminded the
toilweary men of the enemys continued activity Over beyond the rise
of land that lay between the river and Stearns Bayou could be seen
the cloud of mingled smoke and steam that marked the activities of the
dredge For ten minutes they rested in the solace of tobacco Orde
was apparently more at ease than any of the rest but each instant
he expected to hear the premonitory CRACK that would sound the end of
everything Finally he yawned knocked the ashes from his pipe and got
to his feet

Now said he a new ring in his voice come on and lets get
something DONE

They responded to a man

By midnight the water seemed to have gone down slightly Half the
crew snatched a little sleep For several hours more the issue hung
aggravatingly in equilibrium Then with the opening of the channel into
Stearns Bayou the heaviest pressure was relieved For the moment the
acute danger point was passed

Orde spent the next two days in strengthening the defences The men were
able to take their quota of meals and of sleep Merely the working
hours were longer than usual Orde himself slept little and was still
possessed by a feverish activity The flood continued at about the
same volume Until the water should subside the danger could not be
considered completely over with

In these few days of comparative leisure Orde had time to look about
him and to receive news The jam had been successfully held at the iron
railroad bridge above Redding but only by the most strenuous efforts
Braces of oak beams had been slanted where they would do the most good
chains strengthened the weaker spots and on top of all ton after ton of
railroad iron held the whole immovably Nolan had enjoyed the advantage
of a floating jam of convenient facilities incident to a large city
and of an aroused public sentiment that proffered him all the help he
could use Monrovia little village that it was had not grasped
the situation Redding saw it clearly The loss of the timber
alonerepresenting some millions of dollars worth of the sawed
productwould mean failure of mill companies of banks holding their
paper and so of firms in other lines of business and besides would
throw thousands of men out of employment Furthermore what was quite as
serious should the iron bridge give way the wooden bridges below
could hardly fail to go out Railroad communication between eastern and
western Michigan would be entirely cut off For a season industry of
every description would be practically paralysed Therefore Nolan had
all the help he required Every device known was employed to strengthen
the jam For only a few hours was the result in doubt Then as the
CLARION jubilantly expressed it Its a hundred dollars to an old hat
she holds

Orde received all this with satisfaction but with a slight scepticism

Its a floating jam and it gets a push from underneath he pointed
out Its probably safe but another flood might send it out

The floods are going down said North

Good Lord I hope so said Orde

Newmark sent word that a sudden fit of sickness had confined him to the
house

Didnt think of a little thing like piles said Orde to himself
Well thats hardly fair Joe couldnt have realised when he left here
just how bad things were

For two days as has been said nothing happened Then Orde decided
to break out a channel through the jam itself This was a necessary
preliminary to getting the logs in shape for distribution An opening
was made in the piles and the rivermen with pikepole and peavy began
cautiously to dig their way through the tangled timbers The Government
piledriver which had finally been sent up from below began placing
five extra booms at intervals down stream to capture the drift as fast
as it was turned loose From the mills and private booms crews came to
assist in the labour The troubles appeared to be quite over when word
came from Redding that the waters were again rising Ten minutes later
Leopold Lincoln Bunn the local reporter came flapping in on Randalls
old white horse like a second Paul Revere crying that the iron bridge
had gone and the logs were racing down river toward the booms

It just went out he answered the eager exclamations of the men who
crowded around him Thats all I know It went out And the other
bridges Sure All but the Lake Shore Dont know why that didnt go
out No the logs didnt jam there just slid right under

That settles it said Welton turning away

You arent going to quit cried Orde

Certainly Youre crazy said Welton with some asperity If they
cant stop a little jam with iron what are your wooden defences going
to amount to against the whole accumulation When those logs hit the
tail of this jam shell go out before you can wink

He refused to listen to argument

Its sure death said he and Im not going to sacrifice my men for
nothing even if theyd stay

Other owners among the bystanders said the same thing An air of
profound discouragement had fallen on them all The strain of the fight
was now telling The utmost that human flesh and blood was capable
of had been accomplished a hardwon victory had been gained by the
narrowest of narrow margins In this new struggle the old odds were
still against them and in addition the strength that had pushed aside
Reddings best effort augmented by the momentum of a powerful current
It was small wonder they gave up

Already the news was spreading among the workers on the jams As man
shouted to man each shouldered his peavy and came running ashore eager
question on his lips Orde saw the Government driver below casting loose
from her moorings A moment later her tug towed her away to some side
bayou of safety out of the expected rush to the Lake

But we can hold her cried Orde in desperation Have a little nerve
with you You arent going to quit like that

He swept them with his eye then turned away from them with a gesture of
despair They watched him gravely and silently

Its no use boy said old Carlin its sure death

Sure death Orde laughed bitterly All right sure death then Isnt
there a man in this crowd that will tackle this sort of sure death with
me

Im with you

And me said North and the Rough Red in a breath

Good cried Orde You too Johnny Sims and Purdy and Jimmy Powers
Bully boys

I reckon youll need the tug said Marsh

A dozen more of Ordes personal following volunteered At once his good
humour returned and his easy leisurely confidence in himself

Weve got to close that opening first thing said he Marsh tow the
piledriver up there

He caused a heavy line to be run from a tree situated around the bend
down stream to the stern of the driver

Now if you have to he told North who had charge let go all holds
and the line will probably swing you around out of danger We on the tug
will get out as best we can

The opening was to be closed by piles driven in groups of sixteen bound
together by chains The clumps were connected one to the other by a
system of boom logs and ropes to interpose a continuous barrier The
piledriver placed the clumps while the tug attended to the connecting
defences

Now boys said Orde as his last word if she starts to go save
yourselves the best way you can Never mind the driver STAY ON TOP

Slowly the tug and her consort nosed up through the boiling water

Shes rising already said Orde to Marsh watching the water around
the piles

Yes and that jams going out before many minutes supplemented the
tugboat captain grimly

Both these statements were only too true Although not fifteen minutes
before the jam had lain locked in perfect safety now the slight rise
of the waters had lifted and loosened the mass until it rose fairly on
the quiver

Work fast Orde called to the men on the piledriver If we can close
the opening before those Redding logs hit us we may be able to turn
them into our new channel

He did not add that if the opening were not closed before the jam broke
as break it would in a very few moments the probabilities were that
both piledriver and tug would be destroyed Every man knew that
already

Tom North ordered a pile placed in the carriage the hammer descended
At once like battering rams logs began to shoot up from the depths of
the river end foremost all about them These timbers were projected with
tremendous force leaping sometimes half their length above the surface
of the water If any of them had hit either the tug or the piledriver
squarely it would have stove and sunk the craft Fortunately this did
not happen but Marsh hastily towed the scow back to a better position
The pile had evidently been driven into the foot of the jam itself thus
loosening timbers lying at the bottom of the river

The work went forward as rapidly as possible Four times the jam
shrugged and settled but four times it paused on the brink of
discharge Three of the clumps had been placed and bound and fifteen
piles of the last clump had been driven

One more pile breathed Orde his breath quickening a trifle as he
glanced up stream

The hammer in the high derrick ran smoothly to the top paused and
fell A half dozen times more it ripped Then without delay the heavy
chains were thrown around the winch and the steam power began to draw
the clumps together

Done cried Tom North straightening his back

And a job in time too said Johnny Sims indicating the creaking and
tottering jam

North unmoored and the driver dropped back with the current and around
the bend where she was snubbed by the safety line already mentioned

Immediately the tug churned forward to accomplish the last duty that
of binding the defences together by means of chains and cables Two men
leaped to the floating booms and moved her fore and aft Orde and the
Rough Red set about the task Methodically they worked from either end
toward the middle When they met finally Orde directed his assistant to
get aboard the tug

Ill tie this one Jimmy said he

Aboard the tug all was tense preparation Marsh grasped alertly
the spokes of the wheel In the engineroom Harvey his hand on the
throttle stood ready to throw her wide open at the signal Armed with
sharp axes two men prepared to cut the mooring lines on a sign from the
Rough Red They watched his upraised hand When it should descend their
axes must fall

Look out the Rough Red warned Orde who was methodically tying the
last cumbersome knot shes getting ready

Orde folded the knot over without reply Up stream the jam creaked
groaned settled deliberately forward cutting a clump of piles like
straw

Shes coming cried the Rough Red

Give me every second you can said Orde without looking up He was
just making the last turns

The mass toppled slowly fell into the swift current and leaped with a
roar The Rough Red watched with catlike attention

Jump he cried at last and his right arm descended

With the shout and the motion several things happened simultaneously
Orde leaped blindly for the rail where he was seized and dragged aboard
by the Rough Red the axes fell Marsh whirled over the wheel Harvey
threw open his throttle The tug sprang from its leash like a hound
And behind the barrier the logs tossing and tumbling the white spray
flying before their onslaught beat in vain against the barrier like
raging wild beasts whose prey has escaped

Close call said Orde briefly

Bet you replied Marsh

Neither referred to the tugs escape but to the fortunate closing of
the opening




XLI


Orde now took steps to deflect into the channel recently dredged to
Stearns Bayou the mass of the logs racing down stream from Redding He
estimated that he had still two hours or so in which to do the work In
this time he succeeded by the severest efforts in establishing a rough
shunt into the new channel The logs would come down running free Only
the shock of their impact against the tail of the jam already formed was
to be feared Orde hoped to be able to turn the bulk of them aside

This at first he succeeded in doing and very successfully as affecting
the pressure on the jam below The first logs came scattering Then in
a little while the surface of the river was covered with them they
shouldered each other aside in their eagerness to outstrip the rushing
water finally they crowded down more slowly hardly able to make their
way against the choking of the river banks but putting forth in the
very effort to proceed a tremendous power To the crew working in the
channel dredged through to Steams Bayou the affair was that of driving
a rather narrow and swift stream only exaggerated By quick and skilful
work they succeeded in keeping the logs in motion A large proportion of
the timbers found their way into the bayou Those that continued on down
the river could hardly have much effect on the jam

The work was breathless in its speed From one to another sweatbathed
panting man the logs were handed on As yet only the advance of the big
jam had arrived at the dredged channel

Orde looked about him and realised this

We cant keep this up when the main body hits us he panted to his
neighbour Jim Denning Well have to do some more piledriver work

He made a rapid excursion to the boom camp whence he returned with
thirty or forty of the men who had given up work on the jam below

Here boys said he you can at least keep these logs moving in this
channel for a couple of hours This isnt dangerous

He spoke quite without sarcastic intent but the rivermen already over
their first panic looked at each other a trifle shamefacedly

Ill tie into her wherever you say said one big fellow If you
fellows are going back to the jam Im with you

Two or three more volunteered The remainder said nothing but in
silence took charge of the dredged channel

Orde and his men now returned to the jam where on the piledriver the
tugs and the booms they set methodically to strengthening the defences
as well as they were able

Shes holding strong and dandy said Orde to Tom North examining
critically the clumps of piles That channel helps a lot in more ways
than one It takes an awful lot of water out of the river As long as
those fellows keep the logs moving I really believe were all right

But shortly the water began to rise again this time fairly by leaps
In immediate response the jam increased its pressure For the hundredth
time the frail wooden defences opposed to millions of pounds were tested
to the very extreme of their endurance The clumps of piles sagged
outward the network of chains and cables tightened and tightened
again drawing ever nearer the snapping point Suddenly almost without
warning the situation had become desperate

And for the first time Orde completely lost his poise and became
fluently profane He shook his fist against the menacing logs he
apostrophised the river the high water the jam the deserters Newmark
and his illness ending finally in a general anathema against any and
all streams logs and floods Then he stormed away to see if anything
had gone wrong at the dredged channel

Well said Tom North theyve got the old man real good and mad this
time

The crew went on driving piles stringing cables binding chains
although now that the inspiration of Ordes combative spirit was
withdrawn the labours seemed useless futile a mere filling in of the
time before the supreme moment when they would be called upon to pay the
sacrifice their persistence and loyalty had proffered for the altar of
selfrespect and the invincibility of the human Soul

At the dredged channel Orde saw the rivermen standing idle and
halfblind with anger he burst upon them demanding by this that and the
other what they meant Then he stopped short and stared

Square across the dredged channel and completely blocking it lay a
single span of an iron bridge Although twisted and misshapen it was
still intact the framework of its overhead trusswork retaining its
cagelike shape Behind it the logs had of course piled up in a jam
which sinking rapidly to the bed of the channel had dammed back the
water

Where in hell did that drop from cried Orde

Come down on top the jam explained a riverman Must have come way
from Redding We just couldnt SCARE her out of here

Orde suddenly fallen into a cold rage stared at the obstruction both
fists clenched at his side

Too bad boy said Welton at his elbow But dont take it too hard
Youve done more than any of the rest of us could And were all losers
together

Orde looked at him strangely

That about settles it repeated Welton

Settle cried Orde I should think not

Welton smiled quaintly

Dont you know when youre licked

Licked hell said Orde Weve just begun to fight

What can you do

Get that bridge span out of there of course

How

Cant we blow her up with powder

Ever try to blow up iron

There must be some way

Oh there is replied Welton Of coursetake her apart bolt by bolt
and nut by nut

Send for the wrenches then snapped Orde

But it would take two or three days even working night and day

What of it

But it would be too lateit would do no good

Perhaps not interrupted Orde but it will be doing something
anyway Look here Welton are you game If youll get that bridge out
in two days Ill hold the jam

You cant hold that jam two hours let alone two days said Welton
decidedly

Thats my business Youre wasting time Will you send for lanterns and
wrenches and keep this crew working

I will said Welton

Then do it

During the next two days the old scenes were all relived with back of
them the weight of the struggle that had gone before The little crew
worked as though mad Excepting them no one ventured on the river
for to be caught in the imminent break meant to die Old spars refuse
timbers of all sortsanything and everything was requisitioned that
might help form an obstruction above or below water Piles were taken
where they could be found Farmers trees were cut down Pines belonging
to divers and protesting owners were felled and sharpened Some
were brought in by rail Even the inviolate Government supply was
commandeered The Railroad Company had a fine lot which with remarkable
shortsightedness and lack of public spirit they refused to sell at any
price The crew took them by force Once Captain Marsh was found up to
his waist in water himself felling the trees of a wood and dragging
them to the river by a cable attached to the winch of his tug Night
followed day and day night again None of the crews realised the fact
The men were caught in the toils of a labour ceaseless and eternal
Never would it end just as never had it begun Always were they to
handle piles steam hammers and the implements of their trade menaced
by a jam on the point of breaking wet by a swollen and angry flood
overarched by a clear calm sky or by the twinkling peaceful stars Long
since had they ceased to reckon with the results of what they did
the consequences either to themselves or to the jam Mechanically they
performed their labour Perhaps the logs would kill them Perhaps these
long black dripping piles they drove were having some effect on the
situation Neither possibility mattered

Then all at once as though a faucet had been turned off the floods
slackened

Theyve opened the channel said Orde dully His voice sounded to
himself very far away Suddenly the external world too seemed removed
to a distance far from his centre of consciousness He felt himself
moving in strange and distorted surroundings he heard himself repeating
to each of a number of wavering gigantic figures the talismanic words
that had accomplished the dissolution of the earth for himself Theyve
opened the channel At last he felt hard planks beneath his feet and
shaking his head with an effort he made out the pilothouse of the
SPRITE and a holloweyed man leaning against it Theyve opened the
channel Marsh he repeated I guess thatll be all Then quite
slowly he sank to the deck sound asleep

Welton returning from his labours with the iron bridge and the
jam found them thus Men slept on the deck of the tug aboard the
piledriver Two or three had even curled up in the crevices of the jam
resting in the arms of the monster they had subdued




XLII


When Newmark left in the early stages of the jam he gave scant thought
to the errand on which he had ostensibly departed Whether or nor Orde
got a supply of piles was to him a matter of indifference His hope
or rather preference was that the jam should go out but he saw clearly
what Orde blinded by the swift action of the struggle was as yet
unable to perceive Even should the riverman succeed in stopping the
jam the extraordinary expenses incidental to the defence and to the
subsequent salvaging untangling and sorting would more than eat up the
profits of the drive Orde would then be forced to ask for an extension
of time on his notes

On arriving in Monrovia he drove to his own house To Mallock he issued
orders

Go to the office and tell them I am ill said he and then hunt
up Mr Heinzman wherever he is and tell him I want to see him
immediately

He did not trouble to send word directly to Orde up river but left
him to be informed by the slow process of filtration through the
bookkeepers The interim of several hours before Heinzman appeared he
spent very comfortably in his easy chair dipping into a small volume of
Montaigne

At length the German was announced He entered rather red and
breathless obviously surprised to find Newmark at home

Dot was a terrible jam said he mopping his brow and sinking into a
chair I got lots of logs in it

Newmark dismissed the subject with an abrupt flip of his unlighted
cigar

Heinzman said he in three weeks at the latest Orde will come to you
asking for a renewal of the notes you hold against our firm You must
refuse to make such a renewal

All righdt agreed Heinzman

Hell probably offer you higher interest You must refuse that Then
when the notes are overdue you must begin suit in foreclosure

All righdt repeated Heinzman a little restlessly Do you think he
vill hold that jam

Newmark shrugged his shoulders swiftly

I got lots of logs in that jam If that jam goes out I vill lose a heap
of money

Well youll make quite a heap on this deal said Newmark carelessly

Suppose he holds it said Heinzman pausing I hate like the mischief
to joomp on him

Rot said Newmark decisively Thats what hes there for He looked
at the German sharply I suppose you know just how deep youre in
this

Oh I aint backing oudt negatived Heinzman Not a bit

Well then you know what to do said Newmark terminating the
interview




XLIII


Little by little the water went down The pressure already considerably
relieved by the channel into Stearns Bayou slackened every hour Orde
still half dazed with his longdelayed sleep drove back along the marsh
road to town

His faculties were still in the torpor that follows rest after
exhaustion The warm July sun the breeze from the Lake the flash of
light from the roadside water these were all he had room for among his
perceptions He was content to enjoy them and to anticipate drowsily
the keen pleasure of seeing Carroll again In the rush of the jam he had
heard nothing from her For all he knew she and Bobby might have been
among the spectators on the bank he had hardly once left the river It
did not seem to him strange that Carroll should not have been there to
welcome him after the struggle was over Rarely did she get to the booms
in ordinary circumstances This episode of the big jam was after all
nothing but part of the days work to Orde a crisis exaggerated it is
true but like many other crises a man must meet and cope with on the
river There was no reason why Carroll should drive the twelve miles
between Monrovia and the booms unless curiosity should take her

As the team left the marsh road for the county turnpike past the mills
and lumberyards Orde shook himself fully awake He began to review
the situation As Newmark had accurately foreseen he came almost
immediately to a realisation that the firm would not be able to meet
the notes given to Heinzman Orde had depended on the profits from the
seasons drive to enable him to make up the necessary amount Those
profits would be greatly diminished if not wiped out entirely by the
expenses both regular and irregular incurred in holding the jam by
the damage suits surely to be brought by the owners of the piles trees
piledrivers and other supplies and materials requisitioned in the heat
of the campaign and by the extra labour necessary to break out the jam
and to sort the logs according to their various destinations

Ill have to get an extension of time said Orde to himself Of
course Joe will let me have more time on my own personal note to the
firm And Heinzman surely ought toI saved a lot of his logs in that
jam And if he doesnt want to I guess an offer of a little higher
interest will fetch him

Ordinarily the state of affairs would have worried him for it was
exactly the situation he had fought against so hard But now he was too
wearied in soul and body He dismissed the subject from his mind The
horses left almost to themselves lapsed into a sleepy jog After a
little they passed the bridge and entered the town Warm spicy odours of
pine disengaged themselves from the broken shingles and sawdust of the
roadway and floated upward through the hot sunshine The beautiful
maples with their dense shadows threw the sidewalks into coolness
Up one street and down another the horses took their accustomed way
Finally they pulled up opposite the Orde house Orde hitched the horses
and his step quickening in anticipation sprang up the walk and into
the front door

Hullo sweetheart he called cheerily

The echoes alone answered him He cried again and yet again with a
growing feeling of disappointment that Carroll should happen to be from
home Finally a door opened and shut in the back part of the house A
moment later Mary the Irish servant girl came through the diningroom
caught sight of Orde threw her apron over her head and burst into
one of those extravagant demonstrations of grief peculiar to the
warmhearted of her class

Orde stopped short a sinking at his heart

What is it Mary he asked very quietly

But the girl only wept the louder rocking back and forth in a fresh
paroxysm of grief Beside himself with anxiety Orde sprang forward
to shake her by the arm to shower her with questions These elicited
nothing but broken and incoherent fragments concerning the missus
oh the sad day and me lift all alone with Bobby me heart
that heavy and the like which served merely to increase Ordes
bewilderment and anxiety At this moment Bobby himself appeared from the
direction of the kitchen Orde frantic with alarm fell upon his son
Bobby much bewildered by all this pother could only mumble something
about smallpox and took mamma away with doctor

Where where Bobby cried Orde fairly shaking the small boy by the
shoulder He felt like a man in a bad dream trying to reach a goal that
constantly eluded him

At this moment a calm dry voice broke through the turmoil of questions
and exclamations Orde looked up to see the tall angular form of Doctor
McMullen standing in the doorway

Its all right said the doctor in answer to Ordes agonised
expression Your wife was exposed to smallpox and is at my house to
avoid the danger of spreading contagion She is not ill

Having thus in one swift decisive sentence covered the ground of Ordes
anxiety he turned to the sniffling servant

Mary said he sternly Im ashamed of you What kind of an exhibition
is this Go out to the kitchen and cook us some lunch He watched her
depart with a humourous quirk to his thin lips Fool Irish he said
with a Scotchmans contempt I meant to head you off before you got
home but I missed you Come in and sit down and Ill tell you about
it

Youre quite sure Mrs Orde is well insisted Orde

Absolutely Never better As well as you are

Where was she exposed

Down at Heinzmans You knowor perhaps you dontthat old Heinzman
is the worst sort of antivaccination crank Well hes reaped the
reward

Has he smallpox asked Orde Why I thought I remembered seeing him
up river only the other day

No his daughter

Mina

Yes Lord knows where she got it But get it she did Mrs Orde
happened to be with her when she was taken with the fever and
distressing symptoms that begin the disease As a neighbourly deed she
remained with the girl Of course no one could tell it was smallpox at
that time Next day however the characteristic rash appeared on the
thighs and armpits and I diagnosed the case Dr McMullen laughed
a little bitterly Lord you ought to have seen them run Servants
neighbours friendsthey all skedaddled and you couldnt have driven
them back with a steamroller I telegraphed to Redding for a nurse
Until she came Mrs Orde stayed by like a brick Dont know what I
should have done without her There was nobody to do anything at all
As soon as the nurse came Mrs Orde gave up her post I tell you
cried Doctor McMullen with as near an approach to enthusiasm as he ever
permitted himself theres a sensible woman None of your storybook
twaddle about nursing through the illness and all that When her
usefulness was ended she knew enough to step aside gracefully There
was not much danger as far as she was concerned I had vaccinated her
myself you know last year But she MIGHT take the contagion and she
wanted to spare the youngster Quite right So I offered her quarters
with us for a couple of weeks

How long ago was this asked Orde who had listened with a warm glow
of pride to the doctors succinct statement

Seven days

How is Mina getting on

Shell get well It was a mild case Fever never serious after the
eruption appeared I suppose Ill have old Heinzman on my hands
though

Why has he taken it

No but he will Emotional old German fool Rushed right in when he
heard his daughter was sick Couldnt keep him out And hes been with
her or near her ever since

Then you think hes in for it

Sure to be replied Dr McMullen Unless a man has been vaccinated
continuous exposure means infection in the great majority of cases

Hard luck said Orde thoughtfully Im going to step up to your house
and see Mrs Orde

You can telephone her said the doctor And you can see her if you
want to Only in that case I should advise your remaining away from
Bobby until we see how things turn out

I see said Orde Well he concluded with a sigh after a moments
thought I suppose Id better stay by the ship

He called up Dr McMullens house on the telephone

Oh its good to hear your voice again cried Carroll even if I
cant see you You must promise me right after lunch to walk up past the
house so I can see you Ill wave at you from the window

Youre a dear brave girl and Im proud of you said Orde

Nonsense There was no danger at all Id been vaccinated recently And
somebody had to take care of poor Mina until we could get help Hows
Bobby




XLIV


After lunch Orde went downtown to his office where for some time he sat
idly looking over the mail About three oclock Newmark came in

Hullo Joe said Orde with a slight constraint sorry to hear youve
been under the weather You dont look very sick now

Im better replied Newmark briefly this is my first appearance

Too bad you got sick just at that time said Orde we needed you

So I hear You may rest assured Id have been there if possible

Sure thing said Orde heartily his slight resentment dissipating as
always in the presence of anothers personality Well we had a lively
time you bet all right and got through about by the skin of our
teeth He arose and walked over to Newmarks desk on the edge of which
he perched Its cost us considerable and its going to cost us a lot
more Ill have to get an extension on those notes

Whats that asked Newmark quickly

Orde picked up a paper knife and turned it slowly between his fingers

I dont believe Ill be able to meet those notes So many things have
happened

But broke in Newmark the firm certainly cannot do so Ive been
relying on your assurance that you would take them up personally Our
resources are all tied up

Cant we raise anything more on the Northern Peninsula timber asked
Orde

You ought to know we cant cried Newmark with an appearance of
growing excitement The last seventyfive thousand we borrowed for me
finishes that

Cant you take up part of your note

My note comes due in 1885 rejoined Newmark with cold disgust I
expect to take it up then But I cant until then I hadnt expected
anything like this

Well dont get hot said Orde vaguely I only thought that Northern
Peninsula stuff might be worth saving any way we could figure it

Worth saving snorted Newmark whirling in his chair

Well keep your hair on said Orde on whom Newmarks manner was
beginning to have its effect as Newmark intended it should You have
my Boom Company stock as security

Pretty security for the loss of a tract like the Upper Peninsula
timber

Well its the security you asked for and suggested said Orde

I thought youd surely be able to pay it retorted Newmark now secure
in the position he desired to take that of putting Orde entirely in the
wrong

Well I expected to pay it and Ill pay it yet rejoined Orde I
dont think Heinzman will stand in his own light rather than renew the
notes

He seized his hat and departed Once in the street however his
irritation passed As was the habit of the man he began more clearly
to see Newmarks side and so more emphatically to blame himself
After all when he got right down to the essentials he could not but
acknowledge that Newmarks anger was justified For his own private ends
he had jeopardised the firms property More of a business man might
have reflected that Newmark as financial head should have protected
the firm against all contingencies should have seen to it that it met
Heinzmans notes instead of tying up its resources in unnecessary
ways Ordes own delinquency bulked too large in his eyes to admit his
perception of this By the time he had reached Heinzmans office the
last of his irritation had vanished Only he realised clearly now that
it would hardly do to ask Newmark for a renewal of the personal note on
which depended his retention of his Boom Company stock unless he could
renew the Heinzman note also This is probably what Newmark intended

Mr Heinzman he asked briefly of the first clerk

Mr Heinzman is at home ill replied the bookkeeper

Already said Orde He drummed on the black walnut rail thoughtfully
The notes came due in ten days How bad is he

The clerk looked up curiously Cant say Probably wont be back for a
long time Its smallpox you know

True said Orde Well whos in charge

Mr Lambert Youll find him in the private office

Orde passed through the grill into the inner room

Hullo Lambert he addressed the individual seated at Heinzmans desk
So youre the boss eh

Lambert turned showing a perfectly round face ornamented by a dot of a
nose two dots of eyes set rather close together and a pursed up
mouth His skin was very brown and shiny and was so filled by the flesh
beneath as to take the appearance of having been inflated

Yes Im the boss said he noncommittally

Orde dropped into a chair

Heinzman holds some notes due against our people in ten days said he
I came in to see about their renewal Can you attend to it

Yes I can attend to it replied Lambert He struck a bell and to the
bookkeeper who answered he said John bring me those Newmark and Orde
papers

Orde heard the clang of the safe door In a moment the clerk returned
and handed to Lambert a long manilla envelope Lambert opened this quite
deliberately spread its contents on his knee and assumed a pair of
round spectacles

Note for seventyfive thousand dollars with interest at ten per cent
Interest paid to January tenth Mortgage deed on certain lands described
herein

Thats it said Orde

Lambert looked up over his spectacles

I want to renew the note for another year Orde explained

Cant do it replied Lambert removing and folding the glasses

Why not

Mr Heinzman gave me especial instructions in regard to this matter
just before his daughter was taken sick He told me if you came when
he was not herehe intended to go to Chicago yesterdayto tell you he
would not renew

Why not asked Orde blankly

I dont know that

But Ill give him twelve per cent for another year

He said not to renew even if you offered higher interest

Do you happen to know whether he intends anything in regard to this
mortgage

He instructed me to begin suit in foreclosure immediately

I dont understand this said Orde

Lambert shook his head blandly Orde thought for a moment

Wheres your telephone he demanded abruptly

He tried in vain to get Heinzman at his house Finally the telephone
girl informed him that although messages had come from the stricken
household she had been unable to get an answer to any of her numerous
calls and suspected the bell had been removed Finally Orde left the
office at a loss how to proceed next Lambert secretly overjoyed at
this opportunity of exercising an unaccustomed and autocratic power
refused to see beyond his instructions Heinzmans attitude puzzled
Orde A foreclosure could gain Heinzman no advantage of immediate
cash Orde was forced to the conclusion that the German saw here a
good opportunity to acquire cheap a valuable property In that case a
personal appeal would avail little

Orde tramped out to the end of the pier and back mulling over the
tangled problem He was pressed on all sidesby the fatigue after his
tremendous exertions of the past two weeks by his natural uneasiness in
regard to Carroll and finally by this new complication which threatened
the very basis of his prosperity Nevertheless the natural optimism of
the man finally won its ascendency

Theres the year of redemption on that mortgage he reminded himself
We may be able to do something in that time I dont know just what
he added whimsically with a laugh at himself He became grave Poor
Joe he said this is pretty tough on him Ill have to make it up to
him somehow I can let him in on that California deal when the titles
are straightened out

Orde did not return to the office he felt unwilling to face Newmark
until he had a little more thoroughly digested the situation He spent
the rest of the afternoon about the place picking up the tool house
playing with Bobby training Duke the black and white setter dog Three
or four times he called up Carroll by telephone and three or four times
he passed Dr McMullens house to shout his half of a longdistance and
fragmentary conversation with her He ate solemnly with Bobby at six
oclock the two quite subdued over the vacant chair at the other end
of the table After dinner they sat on the porch until Bobbys bedtime
Orde put his small son to bed and sat talking with the youngster as
long as his conscience would permit Then he retired to the library
where for a long time he sat in twilight and loneliness Finally when
he could no longer distinguish objects across the room he arose with a
sigh lit the lamp and settled himself to read

The last of the twilight drained from the world and the window panes
turned a burnished black Through the halfopen sashes sucked a warm
little breeze swaying the long lace curtains back and forth The hum
of lawnsprinklers and the chirping of crickets and treefrogs came with
it

One by one the lawnsprinklers fell silent Gradually there descended
upon the world the deep slumbrous stillness of late night a stillness
compounded of a thousand and one mysterious little noises repeated
monotonously over and over until their identity was lost in
accustomedness Occasionally the creak of timbers or the sharp scurrying
of a mouse in the wall served more to accentuate than to break this
night silence

Orde sat lost in reverie his book in his lap At stated intervals the
student lamp at his elbow flared slightly then burned clear again after
a swallow of satisfaction in its reservoir These regular replenishments
of the oil supply alone marked the flight of time

Suddenly Orde leaned forward his senses at the keenest attention After
a moment he arose and quietly walked toward the open window Just as he
reached the casement and looked out a man looked in The two stared at
each other not two feet apart

Good Lord Heinzman cried Orde in a guarded voice He stepped
decisively through the window seized the German by the arm and drew
him one side

What are you doing here he demanded

Heinzman was trembling violently as though from a chill

Dake me somewheres he whispered hoarsely Somewheres quick I haf
broke quarantine and dey vill be after me

The place for you is at your own house said Orde his anger rising
What do you mean by coming here and exposing my house to infection

Heinzman began to blubber choked shivered all over and cried aloud
with an expression of the greatest agony

You must dake me somewheres I must talk with you and your goot wife I
haf somedings to say to you He in his turn grasped Orde by the arm I
haf broke quarantine to gome and tell you Dey are dere mit shotguns to
kill me if I broke quarantine And I haf left my daughter my daughter
Mina all alone mit dose people to come and tell you And now you dont
listen

He wrung his hands dramatically his soft pudgy body shaking

Come with me said Orde briefly

He led the way around the house to the tool shed Here he lit a lantern
thrust forward one nail keg and sat down on another

Heinzman sat down on the nail keg almost immediately arose walked up
and down two or three times and resumed his seat

Orde looked at him curiously He was half dressed without a collar
his thin hair unkempt The usual bright colour of his cheeks had become
livid and the flesh ordinarily firm and elastic had fallen in folds
and wrinkles His eyes burned bright as though from some internal fire
A great restlessness possessed him Impulsively Orde leaned forward to
touch his hand It was dry and hot

What is it Heinzman he asked quietly fully prepared for the
vagaries of a half delirium

Ach Orde cried the German I am tortured mit HOLLENQUALLEwhat you
callhells fire You whose wife comes in and saves my Mina when the
others runs away You my best friends It is SCHRECKLICH She vas the
noblest the best the most kindest

If you mean Mrs Ordes staying with Mina broke in Orde it was only
what any one should have done in humanity and I for one am only too
glad she had the chance You mustnt exaggerate And now youd better
get home where you can be taken care of Youre sick

No no my friend said Heinzman vigourously shaking his head She
might take the disease She might die It vas noble He shuddered My
Mina left to die all alone

Orde rose to his feet with decision

That is all right said he Carroll was glad of the chance Now let
me get you home

But Heinzmans excitement had suddenly died

No said he extending his trembling hand sit down I want to talk
business

You are in no condition to talk business said Orde

No cried Heinzman with unexpected vigour Sit down Listen to me
Dots better I haf your note for sefentyfive tousand dollars No

Orde nodded

Dot money I never lent you NO Im not crazy Sit still I know my
name is on dot note But the money came from somewheres else It came
from your partner Joseph Newmark

Orde half rose from his keg

Why What he asked in bewilderment

Den ven you could not pay the note I vas to foreclose and hand over
dot Northern Peninsula land to Joseph Newmark your partner

Impossible cried Orde

I vas to get a share It vas a trick

Go on said Orde grimly

Dere is no go on Dot is all

Why do you come to tell me now

Because for more than one year now I say to mineself Carl Heinzman
you vas one dirty scoundrel You vas dishonest a sneak a thief
I dont like to call myself names like dose It iss all righdt to be
smart but to be a thief

Why didnt you pull out asked Orde

I couldnt cried Heinzman piteously How could I He haf me cold
I paid Stanford five hundred dollars for his vote on the charter and
Joseph Newmark he know dot he can PROVE it He tell me if I dont do
what he say he put me in jail Think of dot All my friends go back on
me all my money gone maybe my daughter Mina go back on me too How
could I

Well he can still put you in prison said Orde

Vot I care cried Heinzman throwing up both his arms You and your
wife are my friends She save my Mina DU LIEBER GOTT If my daughter
had died vot good iss friends and money Vot good iss anything I dont
vant to live And ven I sit dere by her always something ask me Vy you
do dot to the peoples dot safe your Mina And ven she look at me her
eyes say it and in the night everything cry out at me and I get sick
and I cant stand it no longer and I dont care if he send me to prison
or to hell no more

His excitement died He sat listless his eyes vacant his hands between
his knees

Vell I go he said at last

Have you that note asked Orde

Joseph Newmark he keeps it most times replied Heinzman but now it
is at my office for the foreclosure I vill not foreclose he can send
me to the penitentiary

Telephone Lambert in the morning to give it to me No here Write an
order in this notebook

Heinzman wrote the required order

I go said he suddenly weary

Orde accompanied him down the street The German was again lightheaded
with the fever mumbling about his daughter the notes Carroll the
voices that had driven him to righteousness By some manoeuvring Orde
succeeded in slipping him through the improvised quarantine without
discovery Then the riverman with slow and thoughtful steps returned
to where the lamp in the study still marked off with the spaced
replenishments from its oil reservoir the early morning hours




XLVI


Morning found Orde still seated in the library chair His head was sunk
forward on his chest his hands were extended listless palms up along
the arms of the chair his eyes were vacant and troubled Hardly once in
the long hours had he shifted by a hairs breadth his position His body
was suspended in an absolute inaction while his spirit battered at the
walls of an impasse For strangely enough Orde did not once even
for a single instant give a thought to the business aspects of the
situationwhat it meant to him and his prospects or what he could
do about it Hurt to the soul he stared at the wreck of a friendship
Nothing will more deeply sicken the heart of a naturally loyal man than
to discover baseless his faith in some one he has thoroughly trusted

Orde had liked Newmark He had admired heartily his clearness of
vision his financial skill his knowledge of business intricacies
his imperturbable coolness all the abilities that had brought him to
success With a man of Ordes temperament to admire is to like and to
like is to invest with all good qualities He had constructed his ideal
of a friend with Newmark as a basis and now that this which had
seemed to him as solid a reality as a brick block had dissolved into
nothing he found himself in the necessity of refashioning his whole
world He was not angry at Newmark But he was grieved down to the
depths of his being

When the full sun shone into the library he aroused himself to change
his clothes Then carrying those he had just discarded he slipped out
of the house and down the street Duke the black and white setter dog
begged to follow him Orde welcomed the animals company He paused only
long enough to telephone from the office telling Carroll he would be out
of town all day Then he set out at a long swinging gait over the hills
By the time the sun grew hot he was some miles from the village and in
the high beech woods There he sat down his back to a monster tree
All day long he gazed steadily on the shifting shadows and splotches
of sunlight on the patches of blue sky the dazzling white clouds that
sailed across them on the waving whispering frond that overarched
him and the deep cool shadows beneath The woods creatures soon became
accustomed to his presence Squirrels of the several varieties that
abounded in the Michigan forests scampered madly after each other in
spirals around the tree trunks or bounded across the ground in long
undulating leaps Birds flashed and called and disappeared mysteriously
A chewink brave in his black and white and tan uniform scratched
mightily with great twofooted swoops that threw the vegetable mould
over Ordes very feet Blazoned butterfliesthe yellow and black
turnus the dark troilus the shadeloving nymphalisflickered in and
out of the patches of sunlight Orde paid them no attention The noon
heat poured down through the forest isles like an incense Overhead
swung the sun and down the slope until the long shafts of its light
lifted wandlike across the tree trunks

At this hint of evening Orde shook himself and arose He was little
nearer the readjustment he sought than he had been the previous night

He reached home a little before six oclock To his surprise he found
Taylor awaiting him The lawyer had written nothing as to his return

I had things pretty well in shape he said after the first greetings
had been exchanged and it would do no good to stay away any longer

Then the trouble is over asked Orde

I wouldnt say that replied Taylor but you can rest easy as to the
title to your lands The investigation had no real basis to it There
may have been some small individual cases of false entry but nothing on
which to ground a real attack

When can I borrow on it

Not for a year or two I should say Theres an awful lot of redtape
to unwind as there always is in such cases

Oh said Orde in some disappointment

Taylor hesitated removed his eyeglasses wiped them carefully and
replaced them He glanced at Orde sidelong through his keen shrewd
eyes

I have something more to tell you something that will be painful
said he

Orde looked up quickly

Well what is it he asked

The general cussedness of all this investigation business had me
puzzled until at last I made up my mind to do a little investigating on
my own account It all looked foolish to me Somebody or something must
be back of all this performance I was at it all the time I was West
between times on regular business of course I didnt make much out of
my direct effortsthey cover things up well in those mattersbut at
last I got on a clue by sheer accident There was one man behind all
this He was

Joe Newmark said Orde quietly

How did you know that cried Taylor in astonishment

I didnt know Frank I just guessed

Well you made a good guess It was Newmark Hed tied up the land in
this trumpedup investigation so you could not borrow on it

How did he find out I owned any land asked Orde

That I couldnt tell you Must have been a leak somewhere

Quite likely said Orde calmly

Taylor looked at his principal in some wonder

Well I must say you take it coolly enough said he at last

Orde smiled

Do I said he

Of course went on Taylor after a moment we have a strong
presumption of conspiracy to get hold of your Boom Company stock
which I believe you put up as security But I dont see how we have any
incontestable proof of it

Proof What more do we want

Wed have no witness to any of these transactions nor have we
documentary proofs Its merely moral certainty and moral certainty
isnt much in a court of law Ill see him if you say so though and
scare him into some sort of an arrangement

Orde shook his head

No said he decidedly Rather not Ill run this Please say
nothing

Of course not interjected Taylor a trifle indignantly

And Ill figure out what I want to do

Orde pressed Taylor to stay to supper but the latter declined After
a few moments conversation on general topics the lawyer took his
departure secretly marvelling over the phlegmatic way in which Orde
had taken what had been to Taylor when he first stumbled against it a
shocking piece of news




XLVII


Orde did not wish to return to the office until he had worked his
problem out so to lend his absence the colour of naturalness he
drove back next morning to the booms There he found enough to keep him
occupied all that day and the next As in those times the long distance
telephone had not yet been attempted he was cut off from casual
communication with the village Late in the afternoon he returned home

A telephone to Carroll apprised him that all was well with her A few
moments later the call sounded and Orde took a message that caused him
to look grave and to whistle gently with surprise He ate supper with
Bobby About startime he took his hat and walked slowly down the street
beneath the velvet darkness of the maples At Newmarks he turned in
between the oleanders

Mallock answered his ring

No sir Mr Newmark is out sir said Mallock Ill tell him you
called sir and started respectfully but firmly to close the door

But Orde thrust his foot and knee in the opening

Ill come in and wait said he quietly

Yes sir this way sir said Mallock trying to indicate the
diningroom where he wished Orde to sit until he could come at his
masters wishes in the matter

Orde caught the aroma of tobacco and the glimmer of light to the left
Without reply he turned the knob of the door and entered the library

There he found Newmark in evening dress seated in a low easy chair
beneath a lamp smoking and reading a magazine At Ordes appearance
in the doorway he looked up calmly his paper knife poised keeping the
place

Oh its you Orde said he

Your man told me you were not in said Orde

He was mistaken Wont you sit down

Orde entered the room and mechanically obeyed Newmarks suggestion
his manner preoccupied For some time he stared with wrinkled brow at a
point above the illumination of the lamp Newmark over the end of his
cigar poised a foot from his lips watched the riverman with a cool
calculation

Newmark Orde began abruptly at last I know all about this deal

What deal asked Newmark after a barely perceptible pause

This arrangement you made with Heinzman

I borrowed some money from Heinzman for the firm

Yes and you supplied that money yourself

Newmarks eyes narrowed but he said nothing Orde glanced toward him
then away again as though ashamed

Well said Newmark at last what of it

If you had the money to lend why didnt you lend it direct

Because it looks better to mortgage to an outside holder

An expression of profound disgust flitted across Ordes countenance
Newmark smiled covertly and puffed once or twice strongly on his nearly
extinct cigar

That was not the reason went on Orde You agreed with Heinzman to
divide when you succeeded in foreclosing me out of the timber lands
given as security Furthermore you instructed Floyd to go out on the eve
of that blow in spite of his warnings and you contracted with McLeod
for the new vessels and youve tied us up right and left for the sole
purpose of pinching us down where we couldnt meet those notes Thats
the only reason you borrowed the seventyfive thousand on your own
account so we couldnt borrow it to save ourselves

It strikes me you are interesting but inconclusive said Newmark as
Orde paused again

That sort of thing is somewhat of a facer went on Orde without the
slightest attention to the interjection It took me some days to work
it out in all its details but I believe I understand it all now I
dont quite understand how you discovered about my California timber
That investigation was a very pretty move

How the devil did you get onto that cried Newmark startled for a
moment out of his cool attitude of cynical aloofness

Then you acknowledge it shot in Orde quick as a flash

Newmark laughed in amusement

Why shouldnt I Of course Heinzman blabbed You couldnt have got it
all anywhere else

Orde arose to his feet and half sat again on the arm of his chair

Now Ill tell you what we will do in this matter said he crisply

But Newmark unexpectedly took the aggressive

Well follow said he the original programme as laid down by
myself Im tired of dealing with blundering fools Heinzmans mortgage
will be foreclosed and you will hand over as per the agreement your
Boom Company stock

Orde stared at him in amazement

I must say you have good nerve he said you dont seem to realise
that you are pretty well tangled up I dont know what they call it
criminal conspiracy or something of that sort I suppose So far from
handing over to you the bulk of my property I can send you to the
penitentiary

Nonsense rejoined Newmark leaning forward in his turn I know you
too well Jack Orde Youre a fool of more kinds than I care to count
and this is one of the kinds Do you seriously mean to say that you dare
try to prosecute me Just as sure as you do Ill put Heinzman in the
pen too Ive got it on him COLD Hes a bribe giverand somewhat of a
criminal conspirator himself

Well said Orde

Newmark leaned back with an amused little chuckle If the man hadnt
come to you and given the whole show away youd have lost every cent
you owned He did you the biggest favour in his power And for your
benefit Ill tell you what you can easily substantiate I forced him
into this deal with me I had this bribery case on him and in addition
his own affairs were all tied up

I knew that replied Orde

What had the man to gain by telling you pursued Newmark Nothing at
all What had he to lose Everything his property his social position
his daughters esteem which the old fool holds higher than any of them
You could put me in the pen perhapswith Heinzmans testimony But
the minute Heinzman appears on the stand Ill land him high and dry and
gasping without a chance to flop

He paused a moment to puff at his cigar Finding it had gone out he
laid the butt carefully on the ash tray at his elbow

Im not much used to giving advice he went on least of all when it
is at all likely to be taken But Ill offer you some Throw Heinzman
over Let him go to the pen Hes been crooked and a fool

Thats what youd do I suppose said Orde

Exactly that You owe nothing to Heinzman but something to what
you would probably call repentance but which is in reality a mawkish
sentimentality of weakness However I know you Jack Orde from top to
bottom and I know youre fool enough not to do it Im so sure of it
that I dare put it to you straight you could never bring yourself to
the point of destroying a man who had sacrificed himself for you

You seem to have this game all figured out said Orde with contempt

Newmark leaned back in his chair Two bright red spots burned in his
ordinarily sallow cheeks He half closed his eyes

Youre right said he with an illconcealed satisfaction If you play
a game play it through Each man is different for each a different
treatment is required The game is infinite wonderful fascinating to
the skilful He opened his eyes and looked over at Orde with a mild
curiosity I suppose men are about all of one kind to you

Two said Orde grimly the honest men and the scoundrels

Well said the other lets settle this thing The fact remains that
the firm owes a note to Heinzman which it cannot pay You owe a note to
the firm which you cannot pay All this may be slightly irregular but
for private reasons you do not care to make public the irregularity Am
I right so far

Orde who had been watching him with a slightly sardonic smile nodded

Well what I want out of this

You might hear the other side interrupted Orde In the first place
said he producing a bundle of papers I have the note and the mortgage
in my possession

Whence Heinzman will shortly rescue them as soon as I get to see him
countered Newmark You acknowledge that I can force Heinzman and you
can hardly refuse him

If you force Heinzman hell land you Orde pointed out

There is Canada for me with no extradition He travels with heavier
baggage I have the better trumps

Youd lose everything

Not quite smiled Newmark And as usual you are forgetting the
personal equation Heinzman isHeinzman And I am I

Then I suppose this affidavit from Heinzman as to the details of all
this is useless for the same reason

Newmarks thin lips parted in another smile

Correct said he

But youre ready to compromise below the face of the note

I am

Why

Newmark hesitated

Ill tell you said he because I know you well enough to realise
that there is a point where your loyalty to Heinzman would step aside in
favour of your loyalty to your family

And you think you know where that point is

Its the basis of my compromise

Orde began softly to laugh Newmark youre as clever as the devil
said he But arent you afraid to lay out your cards this way

Not with you replied Newmark boldly with anybody else on earth
yes With you no

Orde continued to laugh still in the low undertone

The worst of it is I believe youre right said he at last You have
the thing sized up and there isnt a flaw in your reasoning I always
said that you were the brains of this concern If it were not for one
thing Id compromise sure and that one thing was beyond your power to
foresee

He paused Newmarks eyes halfclosed again in a quick darting effort
of his brain to run back over all the elements of the game he was
playing Orde waited in patience for him to speak

What is it asked Newmark at last Heinzman died of smallpox at four
oclock this afternoon said Orde




XLVIII


Newmark did not alter his attitude nor his expression but his face
slowly went gray For a full minute he sat absolutely motionless his
breath coming and going noisily through his contracted nostrils Then
he arose gropingly to his feet and started toward one of the two doors
leading from the room

Where are you going asked Orde quietly

Newmark steadied himself with an effort

Im going to get myself a drink in my bedroom he snapped Any
objections

No replied Orde None After you get your drink come back I want
to talk to you

Newmark snarled at him You neednt be afraid Ill run away Howd I
get out of town

I know it wouldnt pay you to run away said Orde

Newmark passed out through the door Orde looked thoughtfully at
Heinzmans affidavit which duly disinfected had been handed him by
Dr McMullen as important and thrust it and the other papers into his
inside pocket Then he arose to his feet and glided softly across the
room to take a position close to the door through which Newmark had
departed in quest of his drink For a half minute he waited Finally
the door swung briskly inward Like a panther as quickly and as
noiselessly Orde sprang forward A short but decisive struggle ensued
In less than ten seconds Orde had pinioned Newmarks arms to his side
where he held them immovable with one of his own The other hand he ran
down Newmarks right arm to the pocket There followed an instant of
silent resistance Then with a sharp cry of mingled anger and pain
Newmark snatched his hand out and gazed a trifle amazedly at the half
crushed fingers Orde drew forth the revolver Newmark had grasped
concealed in the coat pocket

Without hesitation he closed and locked the bedroom door turned the key
in the lock of the other tried and fastened the window The revolver
he opened spilled out the cartridges into his hand and then tossed the
empty weapon to Newmark who had sunk into the chair by the lamp

Theres your plaything said he So you wanted that affidavit did
you Now we have the place to ourselves and well thresh this matter
out

He paused collecting his thoughts

I dont need to tell you that Ive got you about where you live said
he finally Nor what I think of you The case is open and shut and I
can send you over the road for the best part of your natural days Also
Ive got these notes and the mortgage

Quit it growled Newmark youve got me Send me up and be damned

Thats the question went on Orde slowly Ive been at it three days
without much time off for sleep You hurt me pretty bad Joe I trusted
you and I thought of you as a friend

Newmark stirred slightly with impatience

I had a hard time getting over that part of it and about
threequarters of what was left in the world looked mighty like ashes
for awhile Then I began to see this thing a little clearer Weve been
together a good many years now and as near as I can make out youve
been straight as a string with me for eight of them Then I suppose the
chance came and before you knew it you were in over your neck

He looked halfpleading toward Newmark Newmark made no sign

I know thats the way it might be A man thinks hes mighty brave and
so he is as long as he can see whats coming and get ready for it But
some day an emergency just comes up and touches him on the shoulder
and he turns around and sees it all of a sudden Then he finds hes a
coward Its pretty hard for me to understand dishonesty or how a man
can be dishonest Ive tried but I cant do it Crookedness isnt my
particular kind of fault But I do know this that we every one of us
have something to be forgiven for by some one I guess Ive got a temper
that makes me pretty sorry sometimes Probably you dont see how its
possible for a man to get crazy mad about little things That isnt your
particular kind of fault

Oh for Gods sake drop that preaching It makes me sick broke out
Newmark

Orde smiled whimsically

Im not preaching he said and even if I were Ive paid a good
many thousands of dollars it seems to buy the right to say what I
damn please And if you think Im working up to a Christian forgiveness
racket youre very much mistaken Im not I dont forgive you and I
surely despise your sort But Im explaining to youno to myselfjust
what Ive been at for three days

Well turn me over to your sheriff and lets get through with this
said Newmark sullenly I suppose youve got that part of it all fixed

Orde rose

Look here Newmark thats just what Ive been coming to just what
Ive had such a hard time to get hold of I felt it but I couldnt
put my finger on it Now I know Im not going to hand you over to any
sheriff Im going to let you off No he continued in response to
Newmarks look of incredulous amazement it isnt from any fool notion
of forgiveness I told you I didnt forgive you But Im not going to
burden my future life with you Thats just plain ordinary selfishness
I suppose I really ought to jug you but if I do Ill always carry with
me the thought that Ive taken it on myself to judge a man And I dont
believe any man is competent to judge another I told you whyor tried
toa minute or so ago Ive lived clean and Ive enjoyed the world
as a clean openair sort of propositionlike a windy dayand I always
hope to Id rather drop this whole matter In a short time Id forget
you youd pass out of my life entirely But if we carry this thing
through to a finish Id always have the thought with me that Id put
you in the pen that you are there now I dont like the notion Id
rather finish this up right here and now and get it over and done with
and take a fresh start He paused and wiped his brow wet with the
unusual exertion of this selfanalysis I think a fellow ought to act
always as if he was making the world He ought to try not to put things
in it that are going to make it an unpleasant or an evil world We
dont always do it but we ought to try Now if I were making a world I
wouldnt put a man in a penitentiary in it Of course theres dangerous
criminals He glanced at Newmark a little anxiously I dont believe
youre that Youre sharp and dishonest and need punishment but you
dont need extinction Anyway Im not going to bother my future with
you

Newmark who had listened to this long and rambling exposition with
increasing curiosity and interest broke into a short laugh

Youve convicted me he said Im a most awful failure I thought I
knew you but this passes all belief

Orde brushed this speech aside as irrelevant

Our association of course comes to an end There remain the terms of
settlement I could fire you out of this without a cent and youd have
to git But that wouldnt be fair I dont give a damn for you but it
wouldnt be fair to me Now as for the Northern Peninsula timber you
have had seventyfive thousand out of that and have lent me the same
amount Call that quits I will take up your note when it comes due and
destroy the one given to Heinzman For all your holdings in our common
business I will give you my note without interest and without time for
one hundred thousand dollars That is not its face value nor anything
like it but you have caused me directly and indirectly considerable
loss I dont know how soon I can pay this note but it will be paid

All right agreed Newmark

Does that satisfy you

I suppose its got to

Very well I have the papers here all made out They need simply to be
signed and witnessed Timbull is the nearest notary

He unlocked the outside door

Come said he

In silence the two walked the block and a half to the notarys house
Here they were forced to wait some time while Timbull dressed himself
and called the necessary witnesses Finally the papers were executed In
the street Newmark paused significantly But Orde did not take the hint

Are you coming with me asked Newmark

I am replied Orde There is one thing more

In silence once more they returned to the shadowy low library filled
with its evidences of good taste Newmark threw himself into the
armchair He was quite recovered once again the imperturbable coldly
calculating cynical observer Orde relocked the door and turned to
face him

You have five days to leave town he said crisply Dont ever show up
here again Let me have your address for the payment of this note

He took two steps forward

Ive let you off from the pen because I didnt want my life bothered
with the thought of you But youve treated me like a hound Ive been
loyal to the firms interests from the start and Ive done my best by
it You knifed me in the back Youre a dirty lowlived skunk If you
think youre going to get off scotfree youre mightily mistaken

He advanced two steps more Newmark half arose

What do you mean he asked in some alarm

I mean that Im going to give you about the worst licking you ever
heard TELL of replied Orde buttoning his coat




XLIX


Five minutes later Orde emerged from Newmarks house softly rubbing the
palm of one hand over the knuckles of the other At the front gate he
paused to look up at the stars Then he shut it decisively behind him

Up through the maple shaded streets he walked at a brisk pace breathing
deep unconsciously squaring back his shoulders The incident was
behind him In his characteristic decisive manner he had wiped the whole
disagreeable affair off the slate The copartnership with its gains and
losses its struggles and easy sailing was a thing of the past Only
there remained as after a flood the sediment a final result of it all
the balance between successes and failures a ground beneath the feet
of new aspirations Orde had the Northern Peninsula timber the Boom
Company and the carrying trade They were all burdened with debt it
is true but the riverman felt surging within him the reawakened and
powerful energy for which optimism is another name He saw stretching
before him a long life of endeavour the sort of endeavour he enjoyed
exulted in and in it he would be untrammelled and alone The idea
appealed to him Suddenly he was impatient for the morrow that he might
