Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

SCENE II A Camp near Forres

Alarum within Enter King Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Lennox
with Attendants meeting a bleeding Soldier

DUNCAN
What bloody man is that He can report
As seemeth by his plight of the revolt
The newest state

MALCOLM
This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
Gainst my captivityHail brave friend
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it

SOLDIER
Doubtful it stood
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
And choke their art The merciless Macdonwald
Worthy to be a rebelfor to that
The multiplying villainies of nature
Do swarm upon himfrom the Western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
And fortune on his damned quarrel smiling
Showd like a rebels whore But alls too weak
For brave Macbethwell he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune with his brandishd steel
Which smokd with bloody execution
Like valors minion
Carvd out his passag tTill he facd the slave
And neer shook hands nor bade farewell to him
Till he unseamd him from the nave to the chaps
And fixd his head upon our battlements

DUNCAN
O valiant cousin worthy gentleman

SOLDIER
As whence the sun gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break
So from that spring whence comfort seemd to come
Discomfort swells Mark King of Scotland mark
No sooner justice had with valor armd
Compelld these skipping kerns to trust their heels
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage
With furbishd arms and new supplies of men
Began a fresh assault

DUNCAN
Dismayd not this
Our captains Macbeth and Banquo

SOLDIER
Yes
As sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
If I say sooth I must report they were
As cannons overchargd with double cracks
So they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
Or memorize another Golgotha
I cannot tell
But I am faint my gashes cry for help

DUNCAN
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds
They smack of honor bothGo get him surgeons

Exit Soldier attended

MALCOLM

That seems to speak things strange

Enter Ross

ROSS
God save the King

DUNCAN
Whence camst thou worthy thane

ROSS
From Fife great king
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold
Norway himself with terrible numbers
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The Thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict
Till that Bellonas bridegroom lappd in proof
Confronted him with selfcomparisons
Point against point rebellious arm gainst arm
Curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
The victory fell on us

DUNCAN
Great happiness

ROSS
That now
Sweno the Norways king craves composition
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colmesinch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use

DUNCAN
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interestgo pronounce his present death
And with his former title greet Macbeth

ROSS
Ill see it done

DUNCAN
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won

And mounchd and mounchd and mounchdGive me quoth I

Her husbands to Aleppo gone master o the Tiger

FIRST WITCH
Thou art kind

THIRD WITCH

FIRST WITCH
I myself have all the other
And the very ports they blow
All the quarters that they know
I the shipmans card
I will drain him dry as hay
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his penthouse lid
He shall live a man forbid
Weary sevennights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle peak and pine
Though his bark cannot be lost
Yet it shall be tempesttost
Look what I have

SECOND WITCH
Show me show me

FIRST WITCH
Here I have a pilots thumb
Wreckd as homeward he did come

Drum within

THIRD WITCH
A drum a drum
Macbeth doth come

ALL
The weird sisters hand in hand
Posters of the sea and land
Thus do go about about
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again to make up nine
Peacethe charms wound up

Enter Macbeth and Banquo

MACBETH
So foul and fair a day I have not seen

BANQUO
How far ist calld to ForresWhat are these
So witherd and so wild in their attire
That look not like the inhabitants o the earth
And yet are ontLive you or are you aught
That man may question You seem to understand me
By each at once her chappy finger laying
Upon her skinny lipsyou should be women
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so

MACBETH
Speak if you canwhat are you

FIRST WITCH
All hail Macbeth hail to thee Thane of Glamis

SECOND WITCH
All hail Macbeth hail to thee Thane of Cawdor

THIRD WITCH
All hail Macbeth that shalt be king hereafter

BANQUO
Good sir why do you start and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair I the name of truth
Are ye fantastical or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope
That he seems rapt withalto me you speak not
If you can look into the seeds of time
And say which grain will grow and which will not
Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear
Your favors nor your hate

FIRST WITCH
Hail

SECOND WITCH
Hail

THIRD WITCH
Hail

FIRST WITCH
Lesser than Macbeth and greater

SECOND WITCH
Not so happy yet much happier

THIRD WITCH
Thou shalt get kings though thou be none
So all hail Macbeth and Banquo

FIRST WITCH
Banquo and Macbeth all hail

MACBETH
Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
By Sinels death I know I am Thane of Glamis
But how of Cawdor The Thane of Cawdor lives
A prosperous gentleman and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief
No more than to be Cawdor Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greetingSpeak I charge you

Witches vanish

BANQUO
The earth hath bubbles as the water has
And these are of themwhither are they vanishd

MACBETH
Into the air and what seemd corporal melted
As breath into the windWould they had stayd

BANQUO
Were such things here as we do speak about
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner

MACBETH
Your children shall be kings

BANQUO
You shall be king

MACBETH
And Thane of Cawdor too went it not so

BANQUO
To the selfsame tune and words Whos here

Enter Ross and Angus

ROSS
The king hath happily receivd Macbeth
The news of thy success and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels fight
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his silencd with that
In viewing oer the rest o the selfsame day
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make
Strange images of death As thick as hail
Came post with post and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdoms great defense
And pourd them down before him

ANGUS
We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks
Only to herald thee into his sight
Not pay thee

ROSS
And for an earnest of a greater honor
He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor
In which addition hail most worthy thane
For it is thine

BANQUO
What can the devil speak true

MACBETH
The Thane of Cawdor lives why do you dress me
In borrowd robes

ANGUS
Who was the Thane lives yet
But under heavy judgement bears that life
Which he deserves to lose Whether he was combind
With those of Norway or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage or that with both
He labourd in his countrys wreck I know not
But treasons capital confessd and proved
Have overthrown him

MACBETH
Aside Glamis and Thane of Cawdor
The greatest is behindThanks for your pains
Do you not hope your children shall be kings
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
Promisd no less to them

BANQUO
That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown
Besides the Thane of Cawdor But tis strange
And oftentimes to win us to our harm
The instruments of darkness tell us truths
Win us with honest trifles to betrays
In deepest consequence
Cousins a word I pray you

MACBETH
Aside Two truths are told
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial themeI thank you gentlemen
Aside This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill cannot be goodif ill
Why hath it given me earnest of success
Commencing in a truth I am Thane of Cawdor
If good why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
Against the use of nature Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings
My thought whose murder yet is but fantastical
Shakes so my single state of man that function
Is smotherd in surmise and nothing is
But what is not

BANQUO
Look how our partners rapt

MACBETH
Aside If chance will have me king why chance may crown me
Without my stir

BANQUO
New honors come upon him
Like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use

MACBETH
Aside Come what come may
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day

BANQUO
Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure

MACBETH
Give me your favormy dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten Kind gentlemen your pains
Are registerd where every day I turn
The leaf to read themLet us toward the king
Think upon what hath chancd and at more time
The interim having weighd it let us speak
Our free hearts each to other

BANQUO
Very gladly

MACBETH
Till then enoughCome friends

Exeunt



SCENE IV Forres A Room in the Palace

Flourish Enter Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Lennox and
Attendants

DUNCAN
Is execution done on Cawdor Are not
Those in commission yet returnd

MALCOLM
My liege
They are not yet come back But I have spoke
With one that saw him die who did report
That very frankly he confessd his treasons
Implord your highness pardon and set forth
A deep repentance nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it he died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owd
As twere a careless trifle

DUNCAN
Theres no art
To find the minds construction in the face
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust

Enter Macbeth Banquo Ross and Angus

O worthiest cousin
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee Would thou hadst less deservd
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine only I have left to say
More is thy due than more than all can pay

MACBETH
The service and the loyalty I owe
In doing it pays itself Your highness part
Is to receive our duties and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants
Which do but what they should by doing everything
Safe toward your love and honor

DUNCAN
Welcome hither
I have begun to plant thee and will labor
To make thee full of growingNoble Banquo
That hast no less deservd nor must be known
No less to have done solet me infold thee
And hold thee to my heart

BANQUO
There if I grow
The harvest is your own

DUNCAN
My plenteous joys
Wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrowSons kinsmen thanes
And you whose places are the nearest know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland which honor must
Not unaccompanied invest him only
But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
On all deserversFrom hence to Inverness
And bind us further to you

MACBETH
The rest is labor which is not usd for you
Ill be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach
So humbly take my leave

DUNCAN
My worthy Cawdor

MACBETH
Aside The Prince of CumberlandThat is a step
On which I must fall down or else oerleap
For in my way it lies Stars hide your fires
Let not light see my black and deep desires
The eye wink at the hand yet let that be
Which the eye fears when it is done to see

Exit

DUNCAN
True worthy Banquohe is full so valiant
And in his commendations I am fed
It is a banquet to me Let us after him
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome
It is a peerless kinsman

Flourish Exeunt



SCENE V Inverness A Room in Macbeths Castle

Enter Lady Macbeth reading a letter

LADY MACBETH
They met me in the day of success and I have
learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
mortal knowledge When I burned in desire to question them
further they made themselves air into which they vanished
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from
the king who allhailed me Thane of Cawdor by which title
before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
coming on of time with Hail king that shalt be This have
I thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of
greatness that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by
being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee Lay it to thy
heart and farewell

Glamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt be
What thou art promisd yet do I fear thy nature
It is too full o the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great
Art not without ambition but without
The illness should attend it What thou wouldst highly
That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false
And yet wouldst wrongly win thoudst have great Glamis
That which cries Thus thou must do if thou have it
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone Hie thee hither
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear
And chastise with the valor of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crownd withal

Enter an Attendant

What is your tidings

ATTENDANT
The king comes here tonight

LADY MACBETH
Thourt mad to say it
Is not thy master with him who weret so
Would have informd for preparation

ATTENDANT
So please you it is trueour thane is coming
One of my fellows had the speed of him
Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more
Than would make up his message

LADY MACBETH
Give him tending
He brings great news

Exit Attendant

The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements Come you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here
And fill me from the crown to the toe topfull
Of direst cruelty make thick my blood
Stop up the access and passage to remorse
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
The effect and it Come to my womans breasts
And take my milk for gall your murdering ministers
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on natures mischief Come thick night
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
To cry Hold hold

Enter Macbeth

Great Glamis Worthy Cawdor
Greater than both by the allhail hereafter
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present and I feel now
The future in the instant

MACBETH
My dearest love
Duncan comes here tonight

LADY MACBETH
And when goes hence

MACBETH
Tomorrowas he purposes

LADY MACBETH
O never
Shall sun that morrow see
Your face my thane is as a book where men
May read strange mattersto beguile the time
Look like the time bear welcome in your eye
Your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower
But be the serpent undert He thats coming
Must be provided for and you shall put
This nights great business into my despatch
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom

MACBETH
We will speak further

LADY MACBETH
Only look up clear
To alter favor ever is to fear
Leave all the rest to me

Exeunt



SCENE VI The same Before the Castle

Hautboys Servants of Macbeth attending

Enter Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Banquo Lennox Macduff Ross
Angus and Attendants

DUNCAN
This castle hath a pleasant seat the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses

BANQUO
This guest of summer
The templehaunting martlet does approve
By his lovd mansionry that the heavens breath
Smells wooingly here no jutty frieze buttress
Nor coigne of vantage but this bird hath made
His pendant bed and procreant cradle
Where they most breed and haunt I have observd
The air is delicate

Enter Lady Macbeth

DUNCAN
See see our honourd hostess
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble
Which still we thank as love Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God ild us for your pains
And thank us for your trouble

LADY MACBETH
All our service
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house for those of old
And the late dignities heapd up to them
We rest your hermits

DUNCAN
Wheres the Thane of Cawdor
We coursd him at the heels and had a purpose
To be his purveyor but he rides well
And his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him
To his home before us Fair and noble hostess
We are your guest tonight

LADY MACBETH
Your servants ever
Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt
To make their audit at your highness pleasure
Still to return your own

DUNCAN
Give me your hand
Conduct me to mine host we love him highly
And shall continue our graces towards him
By your leave hostess

Exeunt



SCENE VII The same A Lobby in the Castle

Hautboys and torches Enter and pass over a Sewer and divers
Servants with dishes and service Then enter Macbeth

MACBETH
If it were done when tis done then twere well
It were done quickly If the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence and catch
With his surcease success that but this blow
Might be the beall and the endallhere
But here upon this bank and shoal of time
Wed jump the life to come But in these cases
We still have judgement here that we but teach
Bloody instructions which being taught return
To plague the inventor this evenhanded justice
Commends the ingredients of our poisond chalice
To our own lips Hes here in double trust
First as I am his kinsman and his subject
Strong both against the deed then as his host
Who should against his murderer shut the door
Not bear the knife myself Besides this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been
So clear in his great office that his virtues
Will plead like angels trumpettongued against
The deep damnation of his takingoff
And pity like a naked newborn babe
Striding the blast or heavens cherubin horsd
Upon the sightless couriers of the air
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye
That tears shall drown the windI have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent but only
Vaulting ambition which oerleaps itself
And falls on the other

Enter Lady Macbeth

How now what news

LADY MACBETH
He has almost suppd why have you left the chamber

MACBETH
Hath he askd for me

LADY MACBETH
Know you not he has

MACBETH
We will proceed no further in this business
He hath honourd me of late and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss
Not cast aside so soon

LADY MACBETH
Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dressd yourself hath it slept since
And wakes it now to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely From this time
Such I account thy love Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valor
As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteemst the ornament of life
And live a coward in thine own esteem
Letting I dare not wait upon I would
Like the poor cat i the adage

MACBETH
Prythee peace
I dare do all that may become a man
Who dares do more is none

LADY MACBETH
What beast wast then
That made you break this enterprise to me
When you durst do it then you were a man
And to be more than what you were you would
Be so much more the man Nor time nor place
Did then adhere and yet you would make both
They have made themselves and that their fitness now
Does unmake you I have given suck and know
How tender tis to love the babe that milks me
I would while it was smiling in my face
Have pluckd my nipple from his boneless gums
And dashd the brains out had I so sworn as you
Have done to this

MACBETH
If we should fail

LADY MACBETH
We fail
But screw your courage to the stickingplace
And well not fail When Duncan is asleep
Whereto the rather shall his days hard journey
Soundly invite him his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory the warder of the brain
Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
A limbec only when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death
What cannot you and I perform upon
The unguarded Duncan what not put upon
His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell

MACBETH
Bring forth menchildren only
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males Will it not be receivd
When we have markd with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and usd their very daggers
That they have dont

LADY MACBETH
Who dares receive it other
As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
Upon his death

MACBETH
I am settled and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat
Away and mock the time with fairest show
False face must hide what the false heart doth know

Exeunt



ACT II

SCENE I Inverness Court within the Castle

Enter Banquo preceeded by Fleance with a torch

BANQUO
How goes the night boy

FLEANCE
The moon is down I have not heard the clock

BANQUO
And she goes down at twelve

FLEANCE
I taket tis later sir

BANQUO
Hold take my swordTheres husbandry in heaven
Their candles are all outtake thee that too
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me
And yet I would not sleepmerciful powers
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in reposeGive me my sword
Whos there

Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch

MACBETH
A friend

BANQUO
What sir not yet at rest The kings abed
He hath been in unusual pleasure and
Sent forth great largess to your officers
This diamond he greets your wife withal
By the name of most kind hostess and shut up
In measureless content

MACBETH
Being unprepard
Our will became the servant to defect
Which else should free have wrought

BANQUO
Alls well
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters
To you they have showd some truth

MACBETH
I think not of them
Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve
We would spend it in some words upon that business
If you would grant the time

BANQUO
At your kindst leisure

MACBETH
If you shall cleave to my consentwhen tis
It shall make honor for you

BANQUO
So I lose none
In seeking to augment it but still keep
My bosom franchisd and allegiance clear
I shall be counselld

MACBETH
Good repose the while

BANQUO
Thanks sir the like to you

Exeunt Banquo and Fleance

MACBETH
Go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready
She strike upon the bell Get thee to bed

Exit Servant

Is this a dagger which I see before me
The handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee
I have thee not and yet I see thee still
Art thou not fatal vision sensible
To feeling as to sight or art thou but
A dagger of the mind a false creation
Proceeding from the heatoppressed brain
I see thee yet in form as palpable
As this which now I draw
Thou marshallst me the way that I was going
And such an instrument I was to use
Mine eyes are made the fools o the other senses
Or else worth all the rest I see thee still
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
Which was not so beforeTheres no such thing
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyesNow oer the one halfworld
Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse
The curtaind sleep now witchcraft celebrates
Pale Hecates offerings and witherd murder
Alarumd by his sentinel the wolf
Whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace
With Tarquins ravishing strides towards his design
Moves like a ghostThou sure and firmset earth
Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout
And take the present horror from the time
Which now suits with itWhiles I threat he lives
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives

A bell rings

I go and it is done the bell invites me
Hear it not Duncan for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell

Exit

Enter Lady Macbeth

LADY MACBETH
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold
What hath quenchd them hath given me fireHarkPeace
It was the owl that shriekd the fatal bellman
Which gives the sternst good night He is about it
The doors are open and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores I have druggd their possets
That death and nature do contend about them
Whether they live or die

MACBETH
Within Whos therewhat ho

LADY MACBETH
Alack I am afraid they have awakd
And tis not done the attempt and not the deed
Confounds usHarkI laid their daggers ready
He could not miss emHad he not resembled
My father as he slept I had donetMy husband

Reenter Macbeth

MACBETH
I have done the deedDidst thou not hear a noise

LADY MACBETH
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
Did not you speak

MACBETH
When

LADY MACBETH
Now

MACBETH
As I descended

LADY MACBETH
Ay

MACBETH
Hark
Who lies i the second chamber

LADY MACBETH
Donalbain

MACBETH
This is a sorry sight

Looking on his hands

LADY MACBETH
A foolish thought to say a sorry sight

MACBETH
Theres one did laugh ins sleep and one cried Murder
That they did wake each other I stood and heard them
But they did say their prayers and addressd them
Again to sleep

LADY MACBETH
There are two lodgd together

MACBETH
One cried God bless us and Amen the other
As they had seen me with these hangmans hands
Listening their fear I could not say Amen
When they did say God bless us

LADY MACBETH
Consider it not so deeply

MACBETH
But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen
I had most need of blessing and Amen
Stuck in my throat

LADY MACBETH
These deeds must not be thought
After these ways so it will make us mad

MACBETH
I heard a voice cry Sleep no more
Macbeth does murder sleepthe innocent sleep
Sleep that knits up the ravelld sleave of care
The death of each days life sore labours bath
Balm of hurt minds great natures second course
Chief nourisher in lifes feast

LADY MACBETH
What do you mean

MACBETH
Still it cried Sleep no more to all the house
Glamis hath murderd sleep and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no moreMacbeth shall sleep no more

LADY MACBETH
Who was it that thus cried Why worthy thane
You do unbend your noble strength to think
So brainsickly of thingsGo get some water
And wash this filthy witness from your hand
Why did you bring these daggers from the place
They must lie there go carry them and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood

MACBETH
Ill go no more
I am afraid to think what I have done
Look ont again I dare not

LADY MACBETH
Infirm of purpose
Give me the daggers the sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil If he do bleed
Ill gild the faces of the grooms withal
For it must seem their guilt

Exit Knocking within

MACBETH
Whence is that knocking
How ist with me when every noise appals me
What hands are here Ha they pluck out mine eyes
Will all great Neptunes ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand No this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas incarnadine
Making the green one red

Reenter Lady Macbeth

LADY MACBETH
My hands are of your color but I shame
To wear a heart so white Knocking within I hear knocking
At the south entryretire we to our chamber
A little water clears us of this deed
How easy is it then Your constancy
Hath left you unattendedKnocking within Hark more
knocking
Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us
And show us to be watchersbe not lost
So poorly in your thoughts

MACBETH
To know my deed twere best not know myself Knocking within
Wake Duncan with thy knocking I would thou couldst

Exeunt

Enter a Porter Knocking within

Opens the gate

Enter Macduff and Lennox

MACDUFF
Was it so late friend ere you went to bed
That you do lie so late

PORTER
Faith sir we were carousing till the second cock and
drink sir is a great provoker of three things

MACDUFF
What three things does drink especially provoke

PORTER
Marry sir nosepainting sleep and urine Lechery sir
it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the desire but it
takes away the performance therefore much drink may be said to
be an equivocator with lechery it makes him and it mars him it
sets him on and it takes him off it persuades him and
disheartens him makes him stand to and not stand to in
conclusion equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie
leaves him

MACDUFF
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night

PORTER
That it did sir i the very throat o me but I requited
him for his lie and I think being too strong for him
though he took up my legs sometime yet I made a shift to cast
him

MACDUFF
Is thy master stirring
Our knocking has awakd him here he comes

Enter Macbeth

LENNOX
Good morrow noble sir

MACBETH
Good morrow both

MACDUFF
Is the king stirring worthy thane

MACBETH

MACDUFF
He did command me to call timely on him
I have almost slippd the hour

MACBETH
Ill bring you to him

MACDUFF
I know this is a joyful trouble to you
But yet tis one

MACBETH
The labour we delight in physics pain
This is the door

MACDUFF
Ill make so bold to call
For tis my limited service

Exit Macduff

LENNOX
Goes the king hence today

MACBETH
He does he did appoint so

LENNOX
The night has been unruly where we lay
Our chimneys were blown down and as they say
Lamentings heard i the air strange screams of death
And prophesying with accents terrible
Of dire combustion and confusd events
New hatchd to the woeful time the obscure bird
Clamourd the livelong night some say the earth
Was feverous and did shake

MACBETH
Twas a rough night

LENNOX
My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it

Reenter Macduff

MACDUFF
O horror horror horror Tongue nor heart
Cannot conceive nor name thee

MACBETH LENNOX
Whats the matter

MACDUFF
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lords anointed temple and stole thence
The life o the building

MACBETH
What ist you say the life

LENNOX
Mean you his majesty

MACDUFF
Approach the chamber and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgondo not bid me speak
See and then speak yourselves

Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox

Awake awake
Ring the alarum bellmurder and treason
Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm awake
Shake off this downy sleep deaths counterfeit
And look on death itself up up and see
The great dooms image Malcolm Banquo
As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites
To countenance this horror

Alarumbell rings

Reenter Lady Macbeth

LADY MACBETH
Whats the business
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house speak speak

MACDUFF
O gentle lady
Tis not for you to hear what I can speak
The repetition in a womans ear
Would murder as it fell

Reenter Banquo

O Banquo Banquo
Our royal masters murderd

LADY MACBETH
Woe alas
What in our house

BANQUO
Too cruel any where
Dear Duff I prythee contradict thyself
And say it is not so

Reenter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross

MACBETH
Had I but died an hour before this chance
I had livd a blessed time for from this instant
Theres nothing serious in mortality
All is but toys renown and grace is dead
The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of

Enter Malcolm and Donalbain

DONALBAIN
What is amiss

MACBETH
You are and do not knowt
The spring the head the fountain of your blood
Is stoppd the very source of it is stoppd

MACDUFF
Your royal fathers murderd

MALCOLM
O by whom

LENNOX
Those of his chamber as it seemd had donet
Their hands and faces were all badgd with blood
So were their daggers which unwipd we found
Upon their pillows
They stard and were distracted no mans life
Was to be trusted with them

MACBETH
O yet I do repent me of my fury
That I did kill them

MACDUFF
Wherefore did you so

MACBETH
Who can be wise amazd temperate and furious
Loyal and neutral in a moment No man
The expedition of my violent love
Outrun the pauser reason Here lay Duncan
His silver skin lacd with his golden blood
And his gashd stabs lookd like a breach in nature
For ruins wasteful entrance there the murderers
Steepd in the colours of their trade their daggers
Unmannerly breechd with gore who could refrain
That had a heart to love and in that heart
Courage to makes love known

LADY MACBETH
Help me hence ho

MACDUFF
Look to the lady

MALCOLM
Why do we hold our tongues
That most may claim this argument for ours

DONALBAIN
What should be spoken here where our fate
Hid in an auger hole may rush and seize us
Lets away
Our tears are not yet brewd

MALCOLM
Nor our strong sorrow
Upon the foot of motion

BANQUO
Look to the lady

Lady Macbeth is carried out

And when we have our naked frailties hid
That suffer in exposure let us meet
And question this most bloody piece of work
To know it further Fears and scruples shake us
In the great hand of God I stand and thence
Against the undivulgd pretense I fight
Of treasonous malice

MACDUFF
And so do I

ALL
So all

MACBETH
Lets briefly put on manly readiness
And meet i the hall together

ALL
Well contented

Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain

MALCOLM
What will you do Lets not consort with them
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy Ill to England

DONALBAIN
To Ireland I our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer where we are
Theres daggers in mens smiles the near in blood
The nearer bloody

MALCOLM
This murderous shaft thats shot
Hath not yet lighted and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim Therefore to horse
And let us not be dainty of leavetaking
But shift away theres warrant in that theft
Which steals itself when theres no mercy left

Exeunt



SCENE II The same Without the Castle

Enter Ross and an old Man

OLD MAN
Threescore and ten I can remember well
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
Hath trifled former knowings

ROSS
Ah good father
Thou seest the heavens as troubled with mans act
Threaten his bloody stage by the clock tis day
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp
Ist nights predominance or the days shame
That darkness does the face of earth entomb
When living light should kiss it

OLD MAN
Tis unnatural
Even like the deed thats done On Tuesday last
A falcon towering in her pride of place
Was by a mousing owl hawkd at and killd

ROSS
And Duncans horsesa thing most strange and certain
Beauteous and swift the minions of their race
Turnd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out
Contending gainst obedience as they would make
War with mankind

OLD MAN
Tis said they eat each other

ROSS
They did so to the amazement of mine eyes
That lookd upont
Here comes the good Macduff

Enter Macduff

How goes the world sir now

MACDUFF
Why see you not

ROSS
Ist known who did this more than bloody deed

MACDUFF
Those that Macbeth hath slain

ROSS
Alas the day
What good could they pretend

MACDUFF
They were subornd
Malcolm and Donalbain the kings two sons
Are stoln away and fled which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed

ROSS
Gainst nature still
Thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up
Thine own lifes meansThen tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth

MACDUFF
He is already namd and gone to Scone
To be invested

ROSS
Where is Duncans body

MACDUFF
Carried to Colmekill
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
And guardian of their bones

ROSS
Will you to Scone

MACDUFF
No cousin Ill to Fife

ROSS
Well I will thither

MACDUFF
Well may you see things well done thereadieu
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new

ROSS
Farewell father

OLD MAN
Gods benison go with you and with those
That would make good of bad and friends of foes

Exeunt



ACT III

SCENE I Forres A Room in the Palace

Enter Banquo

BANQUO
Thou hast it nowking Cawdor Glamis all
As the weird women promisd and I fear
Thou playdst most foully fort yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings If there come truth from them
As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine
Why by the verities on thee made good
May they not be my oracles as well
And set me up in hope But hush no more

Sennet sounded Enter Macbeth as King Lady Macbeth
as Queen Lennox Ross Lords Ladies and Attendants

MACBETH
Heres our chief guest

LADY MACBETH
If he had been forgotten
It had been as a gap in our great feast
And allthing unbecoming

MACBETH
Tonight we hold a solemn supper sir
And Ill request your presence

BANQUO
Let your highness
Command upon me to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit

MACBETH
Ride you this afternoon

BANQUO
Ay my good lord

MACBETH
We should have else desird your good advice
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous
In this days council but well take tomorrow
Ist far you ride

BANQUO
As far my lord as will fill up the time
Twixt this and supper go not my horse the better
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain

MACBETH
Fail not our feast

BANQUO
My lord I will not

MACBETH
We hear our bloody cousins are bestowd
In England and in Ireland not confessing
Their cruel parricide filling their hearers
With strange invention but of that tomorrow
When therewithal we shall have cause of state
Craving us jointly Hie you to horse adieu
Till you return at night Goes Fleance with you

BANQUO
Ay my good lord our time does call upons

MACBETH
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot
And so I do commend you to their backs
Farewell

Exit Banquo

Let every man be master of his time
Till seven at night to make society
The sweeter welcome we will keep ourself
Till supper time alone while then God be with you

Exeunt Lady Macbeth Lords Ladies c

Sirrah a word with you attend those men
Our pleasure

ATTENDANT
They are my lord without the palace gate

MACBETH
Bring them before us

Exit Attendant

To be thus is nothing
But to be safely thusour fears in Banquo
Stick deep and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be feard tis much he dares
And to that dauntless temper of his mind
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
To act in safety There is none but he
Whose being I do fear and under him
My genius is rebukd as it is said
Mark Antonys was by Caesar He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me
And bade them speak to him then prophetlike
They haild him father to a line of kings
Upon my head they placd a fruitless crown
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe
Thence to be wrenchd with an unlineal hand
No son of mine succeeding Ift be so
For Banquos issue have I fild my mind
For them the gracious Duncan have I murderd
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man
To make them kings the seed of Banquo kings
Rather than so come fate into the list
And champion me to the utteranceWhos there

Reenter Attendant with two Murderers

Now go to the door and stay there till we call

Exit Attendant

Was it not yesterday we spoke together

FIRST MURDERER
It was so please your highness

MACBETH
Well then now
Have you considerd of my speeches Know
That it was he in the times past which held you
So under fortune which you thought had been
Our innocent self this I made good to you
In our last conference passd in probation with you
How you were borne in hand how crossd the instruments
Who wrought with them and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazd
Say Thus did Banquo

FIRST MURDERER
You made it known to us

MACBETH
I did so and went further which is now
Our point of second meeting Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
That you can let this go Are you so gospelld
To pray for this good man and for his issue
Whose heavy hand hath bowd you to the grave
And beggard yours forever

FIRST MURDERER
We are men my liege

MACBETH
Ay in the catalogue ye go for men
As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
Shoughs waterrugs and demiwolves are clept
All by the name of dogs the valud file
Distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
The housekeeper the hunter every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closd whereby he does receive
Particular addition from the bill
That writes them all alike and so of men
Now if you have a station in the file
Not i the worst rank of manhood say it
And I will put that business in your bosoms
Whose execution takes your enemy off
Grapples you to the heart and love of us
Who wear our health but sickly in his life
Which in his death were perfect

SECOND MURDERER
I am one my liege
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Have so incensd that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world

FIRST MURDERER
And I another
So weary with disasters tuggd with fortune
That I would set my life on any chance
To mend it or be rid ont

MACBETH
Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy

BOTH MURDERERS
True my lord

MACBETH
So is he mine and in such bloody distance
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my nearst of life and though I could
With barefacd power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it yet I must not
For certain friends that are both his and mine
Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down and thence it is
That I to your assistance do make love
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons

SECOND MURDERER
We shall my lord
Perform what you command us

FIRST MURDERER
Though our lives

MACBETH
Your spirits shine through you Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time
The moment ont fort must be done tonight
And something from the palace always thought
That I require a clearness and with him
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work
Fleance his son that keeps him company
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his fathers must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour Resolve yourselves apart
Ill come to you anon

BOTH MURDERERS
We are resolvd my lord

MACBETH
Ill call upon you straight abide within

Exeunt Murderers

It is concludedBanquo thy souls flight
If it find heaven must find it out tonight

Exit



SCENE II The same Another Room in the Palace

Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant

LADY MACBETH
Is Banquo gone from court

SERVANT
Ay madam but returns again tonight

LADY MACBETH
Say to the king I would attend his leisure
For a few words

SERVANT
Madam I will

Exit

LADY MACBETH
Naughts had alls spent
Where our desire is got without content
Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy

Enter Macbeth

How now my lord why do you keep alone
Of sorriest fancies your companions making
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on Things without all remedy
Should be without regard whats done is done

MACBETH
We have scotchd the snake not killd it
Shell close and be herself whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth
But let the frame of things disjoint
Both the worlds suffer
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly better be with the dead
Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy Duncan is in his grave
After lifes fitful fever he sleeps well
Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
Malice domestic foreign levy nothing
Can touch him further

LADY MACBETH
Come on
Gently my lord sleek oer your rugged looks
Be bright and jovial mong your guests tonight

MACBETH
So shall I love and so I pray be you
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo
Present him eminence both with eye and tongue
Unsafe the while that we
Must lave our honors in these flattering streams
And make our faces vizards to our hearts
Disguising what they are

LADY MACBETH
You must leave this

MACBETH
O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
Thou knowst that Banquo and his Fleance lives

LADY MACBETH
But in them natures copys not eterne

MACBETH
Theres comfort yet they are assailable
Then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown
His cloisterd flight ere to black Hecates summons
The shardborne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung nights yawning peal there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note

LADY MACBETH
Whats to be done

MACBETH
Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
Till thou applaud the deed Come seeling night
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me paleLight thickens and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse
Whiles nights black agents to their preys do rouse
Thou marvellst at my words but hold thee still
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
So prythee go with me

Exeunt

MURDERER
Ay my good lord safe in a ditch he bides
With twenty trenched gashes on his head
The least a death to nature

MACBETH
Thanks for that
There the grown serpent lies the worm thats fled
Hath nature that in time will venom breed
No teeth for the presentGet thee gone tomorrow
Well hear ourselves again

Exit Murderer

LADY MACBETH
My royal lord
You do not give the cheer the feast is sold
That is not often vouchd while tis amaking
Tis given with welcome to feed were best at home
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony
Meeting were bare without it

MACBETH
Sweet remembrancer
Now good digestion wait on appetite
And health on both

LENNOX
Mayt please your highness sit

The Ghost of Banquo rises and sits in Macbeths place

MACBETH
Here had we now our countrys honor roofd
Were the gracd person of our Banquo present
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance

ROSS
His absence sir
Lays blame upon his promise Pleaset your highness
To grace us with your royal company

MACBETH
The tables full

LENNOX
Here is a place reservd sir

MACBETH
Where

LENNOX
Here my good lord What ist that moves your highness

MACBETH
Which of you have done this

LORDS
What my good lord

MACBETH
Thou canst not say I did it never shake
Thy gory locks at me

ROSS
Gentlemen rise his highness is not well

LADY MACBETH
Sit worthy friendsmy lord is often thus
And hath been from his youth pray you keep seat
The fit is momentary upon a thought
He will again be well if much you note him
You shall offend him and extend his passion
Feed and regard him notAre you a man

MACBETH
Ay and a bold one that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil

LADY MACBETH
O proper stuff
This is the very painting of your fear
This is the airdrawn dagger which you said
Led you to Duncan O these flaws and starts
Impostors to true fearwould well become
A womans story at a winters fire
Authorizd by her grandam Shame itself
Why do you make such faces When alls done
You look but on a stool

MACBETH
Prythee see there behold look lo how say you
Why what care I If thou canst nod speak too
If charnel houses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back our monuments
Shall be the maws of kites

Ghost disappears

LADY MACBETH
What quite unmannd in folly

MACBETH
If I stand here I saw him

LADY MACBETH
Fie for shame

MACBETH
Blood hath been shed ere now i the olden time
Ere humane statute purgd the gentle weal
Ay and since too murders have been performd
Too terrible for the ear the time has been
That when the brains were out the man would die
And there an end but now they rise again
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns
And push us from our stools this is more strange
Than such a murder is

LADY MACBETH
My worthy lord
Your noble friends do lack you

MACBETH
I do forget
Do not muse at me my most worthy friends
I have a strange infirmity which is nothing
To those that know me Come love and health to all
Then Ill sit downGive me some wine fill full
I drink to the general joy o the whole table
And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss
Would he were here to all and him we thirst
And all to all

LORDS
Our duties and the pledge

Ghost rises again

MACBETH
Avaunt and quit my sight let the earth hide thee
Thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with

LADY MACBETH
Think of this good peers
But as a thing of custom tis no other
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time

MACBETH
What man dare I dare
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear
The armd rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger
Take any shape but that and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble or be alive again
And dare me to the desert with thy sword
If trembling I inhabit then protest me
The baby of a girl Hence horrible shadow
Unreal mockery hence

Ghost disappears

Why sobeing gone
I am a man againPray you sit still

LADY MACBETH
You have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting
With most admird disorder

MACBETH
Can such things be
And overcome us like a summers cloud
Without our special wonder You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe
When now I think you can behold such sights
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
When mine are blanchd with fear

ROSS
What sights my lord

LADY MACBETH
I pray you speak not he grows worse and worse
Question enrages him at once goodnight
Stand not upon the order of your going
But go at once

LENNOX
Goodnight and better health
Attend his majesty

LADY MACBETH
A kind goodnight to all

Exeunt all Lords and Atendants

MACBETH
It will have blood they say blood will have blood
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak
Augurs and understood relations have
By magotpies and choughs and rooks brought forth
The secretst man of bloodWhat is the night

LADY MACBETH
Almost at odds with morning which is which

MACBETH
How sayst thou that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding

LADY MACBETH
Did you send to him sir

MACBETH
I hear it by the way but I will send
Theres not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant feed I will tomorrow
And betimes I will to the weird sisters
More shall they speak for now I am bent to know
By the worst means the worst For mine own good
All causes shall give way I am in blood
Stept in so far that should I wade no more
Returning were as tedious as go oer
Strange things I have in head that will to hand
Which must be acted ere they may be scannd

LADY MACBETH
You lack the season of all natures sleep

MACBETH
Come well to sleep My strange and selfabuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use
We are yet but young in deed

Exeunt



SCENE V The heath

Thunder Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate

FIRST WITCH
Why how now Hecate you look angerly

HECATE
Have I not reason beldams as you are
Saucy and overbold How did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death
And I the mistress of your charms
The close contriver of all harms
Was never calld to bear my part
Or show the glory of our art
And which is worse all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son
Spiteful and wrathful who as others do
Loves for his own ends not for you
But make amends now get you gone
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me i the morning thither he
Will come to know his destiny
Your vessels and your spells provide
Your charms and everything beside
I am for the air this night Ill spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end
Great business must be wrought ere noon
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vaporous drop profound
Ill catch it ere it come to ground
And that distilld by magic sleights
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion
He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear
His hopes bove wisdom grace and fear
And you all know security
Is mortals chiefest enemy

Music and song within Come away come away c

Hark I am calld my little spirit see
Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me

Exit

FIRST WITCH
Come lets make haste shell soon be back again

Exeunt



SCENE VI Forres A Room in the Palace

Enter Lennox and another Lord

LENNOX
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts
Which can interpret further only I say
Things have been strangely borne The gracious Duncan
Was pitied of Macbethmarry he was dead
And the right valiant Banquo walkd too late
Whom you may say ift please you Fleance killd
For Fleance fled Men must not walk too late
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father damned fact
How it did grieve Macbeth did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
Was not that nobly done Ay and wisely too
For twould have angerd any heart alive
To hear the men denyt So that I say
He has borne all things well and I do think
That had he Duncans sons under his key
As ant please heaven he shall notthey should find
What twere to kill a father so should Fleance
But peacefor from broad words and cause he faild
His presence at the tyrants feast I hear
Macduff lives in disgrace Sir can you tell
Where he bestows himself

LORD
The son of Duncan
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
Lives in the English court and is receivd
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward
That by the help of thesewith Him above
To ratify the workwe may again
Give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
Do faithful homage and receive free honours
All which we pine for now and this report
Hath so exasperate the king that he
Prepares for some attempt of war

LENNOX
Sent he to Macduff

LORD
He did and with an absolute Sir not I
The cloudy messenger turns me his back
And hums as who should say Youll rue the time
That clogs me with this answer

LENNOX
And that well might
Advise him to a caution to hold what distance
His wisdom can provide Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England and unfold
His message ere he come that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accursd

LORD
Ill send my prayers with him

Exeunt

SCENE II Fife A Room in Macduffs Castle

Enter Lady Macduff her Son and Ross

LADY MACDUFF
What had he done to make him fly the land

ROSS
You must have patience madam

LADY MACDUFF
He had none
His flight was madness when our actions do not
Our fears do make us traitors

ROSS
You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear

LADY MACDUFF
Wisdom to leave his wife to leave his babes
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly He loves us not
He wants the natural touch for the poor wren
The most diminutive of birds will fight
Her young ones in her nest against the owl
All is the fear and nothing is the love
As little is the wisdom where the flight
So runs against all reason

ROSS
My dearest coz
I pray you school yourself but for your husband
He is noble wise Judicious and best knows
The fits o the season I dare not speak much further
But cruel are the times when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves when we hold rumour
From what we fear yet know not what we fear
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and moveI take my leave of you
Shall not be long but Ill be here again
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
To what they were beforeMy pretty cousin
Blessing upon you

LADY MACDUFF
Fatherd he is and yet hes fatherless

ROSS
I am so much a fool should I stay longer
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort
I take my leave at once

Exit

LADY MACDUFF
Sirrah your fathers dead
And what will you do now How will you live

SON
As birds do mother

LADY MACDUFF
What with worms and flies

SON
With what I get I mean and so do they

LADY MACDUFF
Poor bird thoudst never fear the net nor lime
The pitfall nor the gin

SON
Why should I mother Poor birds they are not set for
My father is not dead for all your saying

LADY MACDUFF
Yes he is dead how wilt thou do for father

SON
Nay how will you do for a husband

LADY MACDUFF
Why I can buy me twenty at any market

SON
Then youll buy em to sell again

LADY MACDUFF
Thou speakst with all thy wit and yet i faith
With wit enough for thee

SON
Was my father a traitor mother

LADY MACDUFF
Ay that he was

SON
What is a traitor

LADY MACDUFF
Why one that swears and lies

SON
And be all traitors that do so

LADY MACDUFF
Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be hanged

SON
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie

LADY MACDUFF
Every one

SON
Who must hang them

LADY MACDUFF
Why the honest men

SON
Then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars
and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them

LADY MACDUFF
Now God help thee poor monkey But how wilt
thou do for a father

SON
If he were dead yould weep for him if you would not it
were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father

LADY MACDUFF
Poor prattler how thou talkst

Enter a Messenger

MESSENGER
Bless you fair dame I am not to you known
Though in your state of honor I am perfect
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly
If you will take a homely mans advice
Be not found here hence with your little ones
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage
To do worse to you were fell cruelty
Which is too nigh your person Heaven preserve you
I dare abide no longer

Exit

LADY MACDUFF
Whither should I fly
I have done no harm But I remember now
I am in this earthly world where to do harm
Is often laudable to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly why then alas
Do I put up that womanly defence
To say I have done no harmWhat are these faces

Enter Murderers

FIRST MURDERER
Where is your husband

LADY MACDUFF
I hope in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him

FIRST MURDERER
Hes a traitor

SON
Thou liest thou shaghaard villain

FIRST MURDERER
What you egg

Stabbing him

Young fry of treachery

SON
He has killd me mother
Run away I pray you

Dies Exit Lady Macduff crying Murder and pursued by the
Murderers



SCENE III England Before the Kings Palace

Enter Malcolm and Macduff

MALCOLM
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty

MACDUFF
Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
Bestride our downfalln birthdom each new morn
New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland and yelld out
Like syllable of dolour

MALCOLM
What I believe Ill wail
What know believe and what I can redress
As I shall find the time to friend I will
What you have spoke it may be so perchance
This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
Was once thought honest you have loved him well
He hath not touchd you yet I am young but something
You may deserve of him through me and wisdom
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
To appease an angry god

MACDUFF
I am not treacherous

MALCOLM
But Macbeth is
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge But I shall crave your pardon
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
Angels are bright still though the brightest fell
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
Yet grace must still look so

MACDUFF
I have lost my hopes

MALCOLM
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts
Why in that rawness left you wife and child
Those precious motives those strong knots of love
Without leavetakingI pray you
Let not my jealousies be your dishonors
But mine own safetiesyou may be rightly just
Whatever I shall think

MACDUFF
Bleed bleed poor country
Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure
For goodness dare not check thee wear thou thy wrongs
The title is affeerdFare thee well lord
I would not be the villain that thou thinkst
For the whole space thats in the tyrants grasp
And the rich East to boot

MALCOLM
Be not offended
I speak not as in absolute fear of you
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke
It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands but for all this
When I shall tread upon the tyrants head
Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever
By him that shall succeed

MACDUFF
What should he be

MALCOLM
It is myself I mean in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That when they shall be opend black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb being compard
With my confineless harms

MACDUFF
Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damnd
In evils to top Macbeth

MALCOLM
I grant him bloody
Luxurious avaricious false deceitful
Sudden malicious smacking of every sin
That has a name but theres no bottom none
In my voluptuousness your wives your daughters
Your matrons and your maids could not fill up
The cistern of my lust and my desire
All continent impediments would oerbear
That did oppose my will better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign

MACDUFF
Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny it hath been
The untimely emptying of the happy throne
And fall of many kings But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours you may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
We have willing dames enough there cannot be
That vulture in you to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves
Finding it so inclind

MALCOLM
With this there grows
In my most illcomposd affection such
A stanchless avarice that were I king
I should cut off the nobles for their lands
Desire his jewels and this others house
And my morehaving would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
Destroying them for wealth

MACDUFF
This avarice
Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root
Than summerseeming lust and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings yet do not fear
Scotland hath foysons to fill up your will
Of your mere own all these are portable
With other graces weighd

MALCOLM
But I have none the kingbecoming graces
As justice verity temperance stableness
Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
Devotion patience courage fortitude
I have no relish of them but abound
In the division of each several crime
Acting it many ways Nay had I power I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
Uproar the universal peace confound
All unity on earth

MACDUFF
O Scotland Scotland

MALCOLM
If such a one be fit to govern speak
I am as I have spoken

MACDUFF
Fit to govern
No not to liveO nation miserable
With an untitled tyrant bloodyscepterd
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accursd
And does blaspheme his breedThy royal father
Was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet
Died every day she lived Faretheewell
These evils thou repeatst upon thyself
Have banishd me from ScotlandO my breast
Thy hope ends here

MALCOLM
Macduff this noble passion
Child of integrity hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples reconcild my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
From overcredulous haste but God above
Deal between thee and me for even now
I put myself to thy direction and
Unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself
For strangers to my nature I am yet
Unknown to woman never was forsworn
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own
At no time broke my faith would not betray
The devil to his fellow and delight
No less in truth than life my first false speaking
Was this upon myselfwhat I am truly
Is thine and my poor countrys to command
Whither indeed before thy hereapproach
Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men
Already at a point was setting forth
Now well together and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel Why are you silent

MACDUFF
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
Tis hard to reconcile

Enter a Doctor

MALCOLM
Well more anonComes the king forth I pray you

DOCTOR
Ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls
That stay his cure their malady convinces
The great assay of art but at his touch
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand
They presently amend

MALCOLM
I thank you doctor

Exit Doctor

MACDUFF
Whats the disease he means

MALCOLM
Tis calld the evil
A most miraculous work in this good king
Which often since my hereremain in England
I have seen him do How he solicits heaven
Himself best knows but strangelyvisited people
All swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye
The mere despair of surgery he cures
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
Put on with holy prayers and tis spoken
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
The healing benediction With this strange virtue
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy
And sundry blessings hang about his throne
That speak him full of grace

MACDUFF
See who comes here

MALCOLM
My countryman but yet I know him not

Enter Ross

MACDUFF
My evergentle cousin welcome hither

MALCOLM
I know him now Good God betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers

ROSS
Sir amen

MACDUFF
Stands Scotland where it did

ROSS
Alas poor country
Almost afraid to know itself It cannot
Be calld our mother but our grave where nothing
But who knows nothing is once seen to smile
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air
Are made not markd where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy the dead mans knell
Is there scarce askd for who and good mens lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps
Dying or ere they sicken

MACDUFF
O relation
Too nice and yet too true

MALCOLM
Whats the newest grief

ROSS
That of an hours age doth hiss the speaker
Each minute teems a new one

MACDUFF
How does my wife

ROSS
Why well

MACDUFF
And all my children

ROSS
Well too

MACDUFF
The tyrant has not batterd at their peace

ROSS
No they were well at peace when I did leave em

MACDUFF
Be not a niggard of your speech how goest

ROSS
When I came hither to transport the tidings
Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumour
Of many worthy fellows that were out
Which was to my belief witnessd the rather
For that I saw the tyrants power afoot
Now is the time of help your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers make our women fight
To doff their dire distresses

MALCOLM
Bet their comfort
We are coming thither gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out

ROSS
Would I could answer
This comfort with the like But I have words
That would be howld out in the desert air
Where hearing should not latch them

MACDUFF
What concern they
The general cause or is it a feegrief
Due to some single breast

ROSS
No mind thats honest
But in it shares some woe though the main part
Pertains to you alone

MACDUFF
If it be mine
Keep it not from me quickly let me have it

ROSS
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard

MACDUFF
Humh I guess at it

ROSS
Your castle is surprisd your wife and babes
Savagely slaughterd to relate the manner
Were on the quarry of these murderd deer
To add the death of you

MALCOLM
Merciful heaven
What man neer pull your hat upon your brows
Give sorrow words the grief that does not speak
Whispers the oerfraught heart and bids it break

MACDUFF
My children too

ROSS
Wife children servants all
That could be found

MACDUFF
And I must be from thence
My wife killd too

ROSS
I have said

MALCOLM
Be comforted
Lets make us medicines of our great revenge
To cure this deadly grief

MACDUFF
He has no childrenAll my pretty ones
Did you say allO hellkiteAll
What all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop

MALCOLM
Dispute it like a man

MACDUFF
I shall do so
But I must also feel it as a man
I cannot but remember such things were
That were most precious to meDid heaven look on
And would not take their part Sinful Macduff
They were all struck for thee naught that I am
Not for their own demerits but for mine
Fell slaughter on their souls heaven rest them now

MALCOLM
Be this the whetstone of your sword Let grief
Convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it

MACDUFF
O I could play the woman with mine eye
And braggart with my tongueBut gentle heavens
Cut short all intermission front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself
Within my swords length set him if he scape
Heaven forgive him too

MALCOLM
This tune goes manly
Come go we to the king our power is ready
Our lack is nothing but our leave Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking and the powers above
Put on their instruments Receive what cheer you may
The night is long that never finds the day

Exeunt

rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her
closet take forth paper fold it write upon it read it
afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this
while in a most fast sleep

DOCTOR
A great perturbation in natureto receive at once the
benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching In this
slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual
performances what at any time have you heard her say

GENTLEWOMAN

DOCTOR

speech Lo you here she comes

her stand close

DOCTOR

GENTLEWOMAN
Why it stood by her she has light by her continually tis her
command

DOCTOR
You see her eyes are open

GENTLEWOMAN
Ay but their sense is shut

DOCTOR
What is it she does now Look how she rubs her hands

GENTLEWOMAN
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her
hands I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour

LADY MACBETH
Yet heres a spot

DOCTOR
Hark she speaks I will set down what comes from her to
satisfy my remembrance the more strongly

LADY MACBETH
Out damned spot out I say One two why then tis
time to dot Hell is murkyFie my lord fie a soldier
and afeard What need we fear who knows it when none can call
our power to accountYet who would have thought the old man to
have had so much blood in him

DOCTOR

LADY MACBETH
The Thane of Fife had a wife where is she nowWhat
will these hands neer be clean No more o that my lord no
more o that you mar all with this starting

dignity of the whole body

DOCTOR
Foul whisperings are abroad unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets

And still keep eyes upon herso goodnight
My mind she has mated and amazd my sight
I think but dare not speak

GENTLEWOMAN
Goodnight good doctor

Exeunt



SCENE II The Country near Dunsinane

Enter with drum and colours Menteith Caithness Angus
Lennox and Soldiers

MENTEITH
The English power is near led on by Malcolm
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff
Revenges burn in them for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man

ANGUS
Near Birnam wood
Shall we well meet them that way are they coming

CAITHNESS
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother

LENNOX
For certain sir he is not I have a file
Of all the gentry there is Siwards son
And many unrough youths that even now
Protest their first of manhood

MENTEITH
What does the tyrant

CAITHNESS
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies
Some say hes mad others that lesser hate him
Do call it valiant fury but for certain
He cannot buckle his distemperd cause
Within the belt of rule

ANGUS
Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faithbreach
Those he commands move only in command
Nothing in love now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him like a giants robe
Upon a dwarfish thief

MENTEITH
Who then shall blame
His pesterd senses to recoil and start
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there

CAITHNESS
Well march we on
To give obedience where tis truly owd
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal
And with him pour we in our countrys purge
Each drop of us

LENNOX
Or so much as it needs
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds
Make we our march towards Birnam

Exeunt marching



SCENE III Dunsinane A Room in the Castle

Enter Macbeth Doctor and Attendants

MACBETH
Bring me no more reports let them fly all
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear Whats the boy Malcolm
Was he not born of woman The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronouncd me thus
Fear not Macbeth no man thats born of woman
Shall eer have power upon theeThen fly false thanes
And mingle with the English epicures
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear

Enter a Servant

The devil damn thee black thou creamfacd loon
Where gottst thou that goose look

SERVANT
There is ten thousand

MACBETH
Geese villain

SERVANT
Soldiers sir

MACBETH
Go prick thy face and overred thy fear
Thou lilyliverd boy What soldiers patch
Death of thy soul those linen cheeks of thine
Are counsellors to fear What soldiers wheyface

SERVANT
The English force so please you

MACBETH
Take thy face hence

Exit Servant

SeytonI am sick at heart
When I beholdSeyton I say This push
Will chair me ever or disseat me now
I have livd long enough my way of life
Is falln into the sear the yellow leaf
And that which should accompany old age
As honour love obedience troops of friends
I must not look to have but in their stead
Curses not loud but deep mouthhonour breath
Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not
Seyton

Enter Seyton

SEYTON
Whats your gracious pleasure

MACBETH
What news more

SEYTON
All is confirmd my lord which was reported

MACBETH
Ill fight till from my bones my flesh be hackd
Give me my armour

SEYTON
Tis not needed yet

MACBETH
Ill put it on
Send out more horses skirr the country round
Hang those that talk of fearGive me mine armour
How does your patient doctor

DOCTOR
Not so sick my lord
As she is troubled with thickcoming fancies
That keep her from her rest

MACBETH
Cure her of that
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseasd
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow
Raze out the written troubles of the brain
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuffd bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart

DOCTOR
Therein the patient
Must minister to himself

MACBETH
Throw physic to the dogsIll none of it
Come put mine armour on give me my staff
Seyton send outDoctor the Thanes fly from me
Come sir despatchIf thou couldst doctor cast
The water of my land find her disease
And purge it to a sound and pristine health
I would applaud thee to the very echo
That should applaud againPullt off I say
What rhubarb senna or what purgative drug
Would scour these English hence Hearst thou of them

DOCTOR
Ay my good lord your royal preparation
Makes us hear something

MACBETH
Bring it after me
I will not be afraid of death and bane
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane

Exeunt all except Doctor

DOCTOR
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear
Profit again should hardly draw me here

Exit



SCENE IV Country nearDunsinane a Wood in view

Enter with drum and colours Malcolm old Siward and his Son
Macduff Menteith Caithness Angus Lennox Ross and Soldiers
marching

MALCOLM
Cousins I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe

MENTEITH
We doubt it nothing

SIWARD
What wood is this before us

MENTEITH
The wood of Birnam

MALCOLM
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And beart before him thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us

SOLDIERS
It shall be done

SIWARD
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
Our setting down beforet

MALCOLM
Tis his main hope
For where there is advantage to be given
Both more and less have given him the revolt
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too

MACDUFF
Let our just censures
Attend the true event and put we on
Industrious soldiership

SIWARD
The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate
Towards which advance the war

Exeunt marching



SCENE V Dunsinane Within the castle

Enter with drum and colours Macbeth Seyton and Soldiers

MACBETH
Hang out our banners on the outward walls
The cry is still They come our castles strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up
Were they not forcd with those that should be ours
We might have met them dareful beard to beard
And beat them backward home

A cry of women within

What is that noise

SEYTON
It is the cry of women my good lord

Exit

MACBETH
I have almost forgot the taste of fears
The time has been my senses would have coold
To hear a nightshriek and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were int I have suppd full with horrors
Direness familiar to my slaughtrous thoughts
Cannot once start me

Reenter Seyton

Wherefore was that cry

SEYTON
The queen my lord is dead

MACBETH
She should have died hereafter
There would have been a time for such a word
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death Out out brief candle
Lifes but a walking shadow a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more it is a tale
Told by an idiot full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing

Enter a Messenger

Thou comst to use thy tongue thy story quickly

MESSENGER
Gracious my lord
I should report that which I say I saw
But know not how to do it

MACBETH
Well say sir

MESSENGER
As I did stand my watch upon the hill
I lookd toward Birnam and anon methought
The wood began to move

MACBETH
Liar and slave

Strikimg him

MESSENGER
Let me endure your wrath ift be not so
Within this three mile may you see it coming
I say a moving grove

MACBETH
If thou speakst false
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive
Till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
I care not if thou dost for me as much
I pull in resolution and begin
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
That lies like truth Fear not till Birnam wood
Do come to Dunsinane and now a wood
Comes toward DunsinaneArm arm and out
If this which he avouches does appear
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
I gin to be aweary of the sun
And wish the estate o the world were now undone
Ring the alarum bellBlow wind come wrack
At least well die with harness on our back

Exeunt



SCENE VI The same A Plain before the Castle

Enter with drum and colours Malcolm old Siward Macduff c
and their Army with boughs

MALCOLM
Now near enough your leafy screens throw down
And show like those you areYou worthy uncle
Shall with my cousin your rightnoble son
Lead our first battle worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upons what else remains to do
According to our order

SIWARD
Fare you well
Do we but find the tyrants power tonight
Let us be beaten if we cannot fight

MACDUFF
Make all our trumpets speak give them all breath
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death

Exeunt



SCENE VII The same Another part of the Plain

Alarums Enter Macbeth

MACBETH
They have tied me to a stake I cannot fly
But bearlike I must fight the courseWhats he
That was not born of woman Such a one
Am I to fear or none

Enter young Siward

YOUNG SIWARD
What is thy name

MACBETH
Thoult be afraid to hear it

YOUNG SIWARD
No though thou callst thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell

MACBETH
My names Macbeth

YOUNG SIWARD
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear

MACBETH
No nor more fearful

YOUNG SIWARD
Thou liest abhorred tyrant with my sword
Ill prove the lie thou speakst

They fight and young Seward is slain

MACBETH
Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn
Brandishd by man thats of a woman born

Exit

Alarums Enter Macduff

MACDUFF
That way the noise isTyrant show thy face
If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine
My wife and childrens ghosts will haunt me still
I cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves either thou Macbeth
Or else my sword with an unbatterd edge
I sheathe again undeeded There thou shouldst be
By this great clatter one of greatest note
Seems bruited Let me find him fortune
And more I beg not

Exit Alarums

Enter Malcolm and old Siward

SIWARD
This way my lordthe castles gently renderd
The tyrants people on both sides do fight
The noble thanes do bravely in the war
The day almost itself professes yours
And little is to do

MALCOLM
We have met with foes
That strike beside us

SIWARD
Enter sir the castle

Exeunt Alarums



SCENE VIII The same Another part of the field

Enter Macbeth

MACBETH
Why should I play the Roman fool and die
On mine own sword whiles I see lives the gashes
Do better upon them

Enter Macduff

MACDUFF
Turn hellhound turn

MACBETH
Of all men else I have avoided thee
But get thee back my soul is too much chargd
With blood of thine already

MACDUFF
I have no words
My voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out

They fight

MACBETH
Thou losest labour
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests
I bear a charmed life which must not yield
To one of woman born

MACDUFF
Despair thy charm
And let the angel whom thou still hast servd
Tell thee Macduff was from his mothers womb
Untimely rippd

MACBETH
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so
For it hath cowd my better part of man
And be these juggling fiends no more believd
That palter with us in a double sense
That keep the word of promise to our ear
And break it to our hopeIll not fight with thee

MACDUFF
Then yield thee coward
And live to be the show and gaze o the time
Well have thee as our rarer monsters are
Painted upon a pole and underwrit
Here may you see the tyrant

MACBETH
I will not yield
To kiss the ground before young Malcolms feet
And to be baited with the rabbles curse
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane
And thou opposd being of no woman born
Yet I will try the last Before my body
I throw my warlike shield lay on Macduff
And damnd be him that first cries Hold enough

Exeunt fighting

Retreat Flourish Enter with drum and colours Malcolm old
Siward Ross Lennox Angus Caithness Menteith and Soldiers

MALCOLM
I would the friends we miss were safe arrivd

SIWARD
Some must go off and yet by these I see
So great a day as this is cheaply bought

MALCOLM
Macduff is missing and your noble son

ROSS
Your son my lord has paid a soldiers debt
He only livd but till he was a man
The which no sooner had his prowess confirmd
In the unshrinking station where he fought
But like a man he died

SIWARD
Then he is dead

FLEANCE
Ay and brought off the field your cause of sorrow
Must not be measurd by his worth for then
It hath no end

SIWARD
Had he his hurts before

ROSS
Ay on the front

SIWARD
Why then Gods soldier be he
Had I as many sons as I have hairs
I would not wish them to a fairer death
And so his knell is knolld

MALCOLM
Hes worth more sorrow
And that Ill spend for him

SIWARD
Hes worth no more
They say he parted well and paid his score
And so God be with himHere comes newer comfort

Reenter Macduff with Macbeths head

MACDUFF
Hail king for so thou art behold where stands
The usurpers cursed head the time is free
I see thee compassd with thy kingdoms pearl
That speak my salutation in their minds
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine
Hail King of Scotland

ALL
Hail King of Scotland

Flourish

MALCOLM
We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves
And make us even with you My thanes and kinsmen
Henceforth be earls the first that ever Scotland
In such an honour namd Whats more to do
Which would be planted newly with the time
As calling home our exild friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queen
Who as tis thought by self and violent hands
Took off her lifethis and what needful else
That calls upon us by the grace of Grace
We will perform in measure time and place
So thanks to all at once and to each one
Whom we invite to see us crownd at Scone

Flourish Exeunt
