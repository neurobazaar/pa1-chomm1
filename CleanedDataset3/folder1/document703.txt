 INTRODUCTION

There is scarcely an UNDRAMATIC writer of the Seventeenth Century
whose poems exhibit so many and such gross corruptions as those
of the author of LUCASTA In the present edition which is the
first attempt to present the productions of a celebrated and
elegant poet to the admirers of this class of literature in a
readable shape both the text and the pointing have been amended
throughout the original reading being always given in the footnotes
but some passages still remain which I have not succeeded
in elucidating to my satisfaction and one or two which have defied
all my attempts at emendation though as they stand they are
unquestionably nonsense It is proper to mention that several
rather bold corrections have been hazarded in the course of the
volume but where this has been done the deviation from the
original has invariably been pointed out in the notes

On the titlepage of the copy of LUCASTA 1649 preserved among
the Kings Pamphlets in the British Museum the original possessor
has according to his usual practice marked the date of purchase
viz June 21 perhaps and indeed probably that was also
the date of publication A copy of LUCASTA 1649 occasionally
appears in catalogues purporting to have belonged to Anne
Lady Lovelace but the autograph which it contains was taken
from a copy of Massingers BONDMAN edit 1638 4to which her
Ladyship once owned This copy of Lovelaces LUCASTA is bound up
with the copy of the POSTHUME POEMS once in the possession
of Benjamin Rudyerd Esq grandson and heir of the distinguished
Sir Benjamin Rudyerd as appears also from his autograph
on the title11

In the original edition of the two parts of LUCASTA 164959
the arrangement of the poems appears like that of the text
to have been left to chance and the result has been a total
absence of method I have therefore felt it part of my duty to
systematise the contents of the volume and so far as it lay in my
power to place the various pieces of which it consisted in their
proper order all the odes sonnets c addressed or referring to
the lady who is concealed under the names of LUCASTA and AMARANTHA
have now been for the first time brought together and the copies
of commendatory and gratulatory verses with one exception prefixed
by Lovelace to various publications by friends during his lifetime
either prior to the appearance of the first part of his own
poems in 1649 or between that date and the issue of his Remains
ten years later have been placed by themselves as an act of
justice to the writer of whose style and genius they are as is
generally the case with all compositions of the kind by no means
favourable specimens The translations from Catullus Ausonius
c have been left as they stood they are for the most part
destitute of merit but as they were inserted by the Poets
brother when he edited the posthumous volume I did not think it
right to disturb them and they have been retained in their full
integrity

Lovelaces LUCASTA was included by the late S W Singer Esq
in his series of Early English Poets but that gentleman
besides striking out certain passages which he somewhat
unaccountably and inconsistently regarded as indelicate
omitted a good deal of preliminary matter in the form of
commendatory verses which though possibly of small worth
were necessary to render the book complete it is possible
that Mr Singer made use of a copy of LUCASTA which was deficient
at the commencement It may not be generally known that
independently of its imperfections in other respects
Mr Singers reprint abounds with the grossest blunders

The old orthography has been preserved intact in this edition
but with respect to the employment of capitals the entirely
arbitrary manner in which they are introduced into the book as
originally published has made it necessary to reduce them as well
as the singularly capricious punctuation to modern rules At the
same time in those cases where capitals seemed more characteristic
or appropriate they have been retained

It is a singular circumstance that Mr Singer in common with
Wood Bliss Ellis Headley and all other biographers overlooked
the misprint of ARAMANTHA for AMARANTHA which the old compositor
made with one or two exceptions wherever the word occurred In
giving a correct representation of the original titlepage I have
been obliged to print ARAMANTHA

In the hope of discovering the exact date of Lovelaces birth
and baptism I communicated with the Rev A J Pearman incumbent
of Bethersden near Ashford and that gentleman obligingly examined
the registers for me but no traces of Lovelaces name are to be
found

 BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE

With the exception of Sir Egerton Brydges who contributed to the
GENTLEMANS MAGAZINE for 17912 a series of articles on the life
and writings of the subject of the present memoir all the
biographers of Richard Lovelace have contented themselves with
following the account left by Anthony Wood of his short and unhappy
career I do not think that I can do better than commence at
least by giving word for word the narrative of Wood in his own
language to which I purpose to add such additional particulars in
the form of notes or otherwise as I may be able to supply But
the reader must not expect much that is new for I regret to say
that after the most careful researches I have not improved to
any large extent the state of knowledge respecting this elegant
poet and unfortunate man

Richard Lovelace writes Wood the eldest son of Sir William
Lovelace21 of Woollidge in Kent knight was born in that
country in 1618 educated in grammar learning in
Charterhouse22 School near London became a gent commoner of
Gloucester Hall in the beginning of the year 163423 and in that
of his age sixteen being then accounted the most amiable and
beautiful person that ever eye beheld a person also of innate
modesty virtue and courtly deportment which made him then but
especially after when he retired to the great city much admired
and adored by the female sex In 1636 when the king and queen
were for some days entertained at Oxon he was at the request of a
great lady belonging to the queen made to the Archbishop of
Canterbury Laud then Chancellor of the University actually
created among other persons of quality Master of Arts though but
of two years standing at which time his conversation being made
public and consequently his ingenuity and generous soul
discovered he became as much admired by the male as before by the
female sex After he had left the University he retired in great
splendour to the court and being taken into the favour of Lord
George Goring afterwards Earl of Norwich was by him adopted a
soldier and sent in the quality of an ensign in the Scotch
expedition an 1639 Afterwards in the second expedition he was
commissionated a captain in the same regiment and in that time
wrote a tragedy called THE SOLDIER but never acted because the
stage was soon after suppressed After the pacification of
Berwick he retired to his native country and took possession of
his estate at Lovelace Place in the parish of Bethersden24 at
Canterbury Chart Halden c worth at least pounds500 per
annum About which time he being then on the commission of the
peace was made choice of by the whole body of the county of Kent
at an assize to deliver the Kentish petition25 to the House of
Commons for the restoring the king to his rights and for settling
the government c For which piece of service he was committed
April 30 1642 to the Gatehouse at Westminster26 where he
made that celebrated song called STONE WALLS DO NOT A PRISON MAKE
c After three or four months six or seven weeks imprisonment
he had his liberty upon bail of pounds40000 pounds4000
not to stir out of the lines of communication without a pass from
the speaker During the time of this confinement to London
he lived beyond the income of his estate either to keep up
the credit and reputation of the kings cause by furnishing
men with horses and arms or by relieving ingenious men in want
whether scholars musicians soldiers c Also by furnishing
his two brothers Colonel Franc Lovelace and Captain William
Lovelace afterwards slain at Caermarthen27 with men and
money for the kings cause and his other brother called Dudley
Posthumus Lovelace with moneys for his maintenance in Holland
to study tactics and fortification in that school of war After
the rendition of Oxford garrison in 1646 he formed a regiment
for the service of the French king was colonel of it and
wounded at Dunkirk28 and in 1648 returning into England he
with Dudley Posthumus before mentioned then a captain under him
were both committed prisoners to Peter House29 in London where
he framed his poems for the press entitled LUCASTA EPODES ODES
SONNETS SONGS c Lond 1649 Oct The reason why he gave that
title was because some time before he had made his amours to a
gentlewoman of great beauty and fortune named Lucy Sacheverell
whom he usually called LUX CASTA but she upon a stray report that
Lovelace was dead of his wound received at Dunkirk soon after
married210 He also wrote ARAMANTHA Amarantha A PASTORAL
printed with LUCASTA211 Afterwards a musical composition of two
parts was set to part of it by Henry Lawes212 sometimes servant
to king Charles I in his public and private music

After the murther of king Charles I Lovelace was set at liberty
and having by that time consumed all his estate213 grew
very melancholy which brought him at length into a consumption
became very poor in body and purse was the object of charity
went in ragged cloaths whereas when he was in his glory he wore
cloth of gold and silver and mostly lodged in obscure and dirty
places more befitting the worst of beggars and poorest of
servants c After his death his brother Dudley before
mentioned made a collection of his poetical papers fitted them
for the press and entitled them LUCASTA POSTHUME POEMS Lond
1659214 Oct the second part with his picture before
them215 These are all the things that he hath extant those
that were never published were his tragedy called THE SOLDIER or
SOLDIERS before mentioned and his comedy called THE
SCHOLAR216 which he composed at sixteen years of age when he
came first to Gloucester hall acted with applause afterwards in
Salisbury Court He died in a very mean lodging in Gunpowder
Alley217 near Shoe Lane218 and was buried at the westend
of the church of S Bride alias Bridget in London near to the
body of his kinsman Will Lovelace of Grays Inn Esq in sixteen
hundred fifty and eight219 having before been accounted by all
those that well knew him to have been a person well versed in the
Greek220 and Latin221 poets in music whether practical or
theoretical instrumental or vocal and in other things befitting a
gentleman Some of the said persons have also added in my
hearing that his common discourse was not only significant and
witty but incomparably graceful which drew respect from all men
and women Many other things I could now say of him relating
either to his most generous mind in his prosperity or dejected
estate in his worst state of poverty but for brevitys sake I
shall now pass them by At the end of his Posthume Poems are
several elegies written on him by eminent poets of that time
wherein you may see his just character

Such is Woods account it is to be regretted that that writer
did not supply the additional information which he tantalizes us
by saying that he possessed and could have published had he not
been afraid of being tedious His love of brevity is in this
case most provoking

As might be expected the Journals of Parliament cast additional
light on the personal connexion of Lovelace with the Kentish
Petition of 1642 which was for the GENERAL redress of existing
grievances not as the editor of the VERNEY PAPERS seems to have
considered merely for the adjustment of certain points relative to
the Militia Parliamentary literature has not a very strong
fascination for the editors of old authors and the biographers of
Lovelace have uniformly overlooked the mine of information which
lies in the LORDS AND COMMONS JOURNALS The subject was
apparently introduced for the first time into Parliament on the
28th March 1642 when a conference of both Houses took place
respecting a petition from Kent which praying for a Restoration
of the Bishops Liturgy and Common Prayer and other constitutional
measures was voted seditious and against privilege and the peace
of the kingdom on the same occasion Lord Bristol and Mr Justice
Mallett were committed to the Tower for having in their possession
a copy of the document On the 7th April it was ordered by both
Houses that the Kentish Petition should be burned by the hands of
the common hangman

On the 28th April the Commons acquainted the Upper House
by Mr Oliver Cromwell that a great meeting was to be held
next day on Blackheath to back the rejected Kentish
Petition222

Two days later a strange scene occurred at Westminster
Let the Commons Journals tell the story in their own language

30 April 1642 The House being informed that divers gentlemen
of the county of Kent were at the door that desired to present
a petition to the House

They were called in presented their Petition and withdrew

And their Petition was read and appeared to be the same
that was formerly burnt by order of both Houses by the hands
of the common hangman Captain LEIGH reports that being at
the Quarter Sessions held at MAIDSTONE he observed certain
passages which he delivered in writing

Captain Lovelace who presented the Petition was called in
and Mr Speaker was commanded to ask him from whose hand
he had this Petition and who gave him warrant to present it

Mr GEO CHUTE delivered him he replied the Petition the next
day after the Assizes

The gentlemen he continued that were assembled at BLACKHEATH
commanded him to deliver it

The Speaker then inquired whether he knew that the like was
burnt by the order of this House and that some were here
questioned for the business

He understood a general rumour that some gentlemen were
questioned

He had heard a fortnight since that the like Petition was burned
by the hand of the common hangman

He knew nothing of the bundle of printed petitions

He likewise said that there was a petition at the Quarter
Sessions disavowed by all the Justices there which he tore

Sir William Boteler was likewise called in and asked when he
was at Yorke

He answered On Wednesday last was sevennight he came from
Yorke and came to his house in London

He heard of a petition that was never delivered

He never heard of any censure of the Parliament

He heard that a paper was burnt for being irregularly burnt
presented

He had heard that the Petition that went under the name of
the Kentish Petition was burnt by the hands of the common hangman

He never heard of any order of either or of both the Houses
concerning the Petition

He was at Hull on Thursday or Friday was a sevennight as he
came from Yorke he took Hull in the way He had heard that
Sir Roger Twisden was questioned for the like Petition

He was yesterday at BLACKHEATH

Resolved upon the question that Captain Lovelace shall be
presently Committed prisoner to the Gatehouse

Resolved upon the question that Sir William Boteler shall be
presently committed prisoner to the Fleet

Ordered that the sergeant shall apprehend them and carry them
in safe custody and deliver them as prisoners to the several
prisons aforesaid

On the 4th May 1642 the House of Commons ordered Mr Whittlock
and others to prepare a charge against Mr Lovelace and Sir William
Boteler with all expedition but nothing further is heard of the
matter till the 17th June When Lovelace223 and Boteler
petitioned the House separately for their release from custody
Hereupon Sir William was discharged on finding personal bail to the
extent of pounds10000 with a surety for pounds5000 and in
the case of his companion in misfortune it was ordered on the
question that he be forthwith bailed upon GOOD security This
good security surely did not reach the sum mentioned by Wood
namely pounds40000 but it is likely that the author of the
ATHENAE is ONLY wrong by a cypher and that the amount fixed was
pounds4000 as it has been already suggested Thus Lovelaces
confinement did not exceed seven weeks in duration and the
probability is that the sole inconvenience which he subsequently
experienced was the loss of the bail

The description left by Wood and Aubrey of the end of Lovelace
can only be reconciled with the fact that his daughter and heiress
conveyed Kingsdown Hever224 and a moiety of Chipsted
to the Cokes by marriage with Mr Henry Coke by presuming that
those manors were entailed while Lovelace Place as well perhaps
as Bayford and Goodneston not being similarly secured were sold
to defray the owners incumbrances At any rate it is not
upon the whole very probable that he died in a hovel in a state
of absolute poverty225 that he received a pound a week
equal to about pounds4 of our money from two friends
Cotton and another Aubrey himself admits and we may rest
satisfied that however painful the contrast may have been between
the opening and close of that career the deplorable account given
in the ATHENAE and in the socalled LIVES OF EMINENT MEN is much
exaggerated and overdrawn

It has not hitherto been remarked that among the Kentish gentry
who from time to time elected to change the nature of their
tenure from gavelkind to primogeniture were the Lovelaces
themselves in the person of Thomas Lovelace226 who by Act of
Parliament 2 and 3 Edw VI obtained concurrently with several
other families the power of conversion This Thomas Lovelace was
not improbably the same who was admitted a student of Grays Inn
in 1541 and that he was of the Kentish Lovelaces there is not much
reason to doubt although at the same time I am unable to fix the
precise degree of consanguinity between him and Serjeant William
Lovelace of Grays Inn who died in 1576 and who was greatgrandfather
to the author of LUCASTA The circumstance that the real property
of Thomas Lovelace aforesaid situated in Kent was released by Act
of Parliament 2 and 3 Edw VI from the operations of gavelkind tenure
assuming as is most likely to have been the case that he was of the
same stock as the poet though not an immediate ancestor seems to
explain the following allusion by Dudley Lovelace in the verses
prefixed by him to LUCASTA 1649

 Those by the landed have been writ
 Mines but a youngerbrother wit

As well as the subjoined lines by Lovelace in the poem entitled
To Lucasta from Prison see p 44 of present edition

 Next would I court my LIBERTY
 And then my birthright PROPERTY

There is evidence to prove that Lovelace was on intimate terms
with some of the wits of his time and that he had friendly
relations with many of themsuch as Hall Rawlins Lenton and
particularly the Cottons John Tatham the City Poet and author
of THE FANCIES THEATER 1640 knew him well and addressed to him
some stanzas not devoid of merit during his stay abroad
In 1643 Henry Glapthorne a celebrated dramatist and poet
of the same age dedicated to Lovelace his poem of WHITEHALL
printed in that year in a quarto pamphlet with elegies
on the Earls of Bedford and Manchester227 The pages
of LUCASTA bear testimony to the acquaintance of the author
with Anthony Hodges of New College Oxford translator of
CLITOPHON AND LEUCIPPE from the Greek of Achilles Tatius
or rather probably from a Latin version of the original
and with other228 members of the University229

Although it is stated by Wood that LUCASTA was prepared for the
press by Lovelace himself on his return from the Continent in
1648 it is impossible to believe that any care was bestowed on the
correction of the text or on the arrangement of the various pieces
which compose the volume nor did his brother Dudley Posthumus who
edited the second part of the book in 1659 perform his task in any
degree better In both instances the printer seems to have been
suffered to do the work in his own way and very infamously he has
done it To supply all the shortcomings of the author and his
literary executor at this distance of time is unfortunately out
of the power of any editor but in the present republication I have
taken the liberty of rearranging the poems to a certain extent in
the order in which it may be conjectured that they were written
and where Lovelace contributed commendatory verses to other works
either before or after the appearance of the first portion of
LUCASTA the two texts have been collated and improved readings
been occasionally obtained

The few poems on which the fame of Lovelace may be said to rest
are emanations not only of the stirring period in which he lived
but of the peculiar circumstances into which he was thrown
at different epochs of his life Lovelace had not the melodious
and exquisite taste of Herrick the wit of Suckling or the power
of Randolph so often second only to his master Jonson
Mr Singer has praised the exuberant fancy of Lovelace but
in my thinking Lovelace was inferior in fancy as well as in
grace both to Carew and the author of HESPERIDES Yet Lovelace
has left behind him one or two things which I doubt if any of
those writers could have produced and which our greatest poets
would not have been ashamed to own Winstanley was so far right in
instituting a comparison between Lovelace and Sydney that it is
hard to name any one in the entire circle of early English
literature except Sydney and Wither who could have attempted with
any chance of success the SONG TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON and how
differently Sydney at least would have handled it We know what
Herrick would have made of it it would have furnished the theme
for one more invocation to Julia From Suckling we should have had
a bantering playfulness or a fescennine gaiety equally unsuited
to the subject Waller had once an opportunity of realizing the
position which has been described by his contemporary in immortal
stanzas but Waller when he was under confinement was thinking
too much of his neck to write verses with much felicity and
preferred waiting till he got back to Beaconsfield when his
inspiration had evaporated to pour out his feelings to Lady
Dorothy or Lady Sophia Withers song Shall I wasting in
Despair is certainly superior to the SONG TO ALTHEA Wither was
frequently equal to Lovelace in poetical imagery and sentiment and
he far excelled him in versification The versification of
Lovelace is indeed more rugged and unmusical than that of any other
writer of the period and this blemish is so conspicuous throughout
LUCASTA and is noticeable in so many cases where it might have
been avoided with very little trouble that we are naturally led to
the inference that Lovelace in writing accepted from indolence or
haste the first word which happened to occur to his mind Daniel
Drayton and others were it is well known indefatigable revisers
of their poems they added and altered many times mostly
for the better occasionally for the worse We can scarcely
picture to ourselves Lovelace blotting a line though it would
have been well for his reputation if he had blotted many

In the poem of the LOOSE SARABAND p 34 there is some resemblance
to a piece translated from Meleager in Eltons SPECIMENS OF CLASSIC
POETS i 411 and entitled by Elton Playing at Hearts

 Love acts the tennisplayers part
 And throws to thee my panting heart
 Heliodora ere it fall
 Let desire catch swift the ball
 Let her in the ballcourt move
 Follow in the game with love
 If thou throw me back again
 I shall of foul play complain

And an address to the Cicada by the same writer IBID i 415
opens with these lines

 Oh shrillvoiced insect that with dewdrops sweet
 Inebriate dost in desert woodlands sing

In the poem called The Grasshopper p 94 the author speaks
of the insect as

 Drunk evry night with a delicious tear
 Dropped thee from heaven

The similarity in each case I believe to have been entirely
accidental nor am I disposed to think that Lovelace was under any
considerable or direct obligations to the classics I have taken
occasion to remark that Lovelace seems to have helped to furnish
a model to Cleveland who carried to an extraordinary length that
fondness for words and figures derived from the alchymists
vocabulary but as regards the author of LUCASTA himself it may
be asserted that there are few writers whose productions exhibit
less of booklore than his and even in those places where he has
employed phrases or images similar to some found in Peele
Middleton Herrick and others there is great room to question
whether the circumstance can be treated as amounting to more than
a curious coincidence

The Master of Dulwich College has obligingly informed me
that the picture of ALTHEA as well as that of Lovelace himself
bequeathed by Cartwright the actor to Dulwich College in 1687
bears no clue to date of composition or to the artists name
and that it does not assist in the identification of the lady
This is the more vexatious inasmuch as it seems probable that
ALTHEA whoever she was became the poets wife after LUCASTAS
marriage to another The CHLOES c mentioned in the following
pages were merely more or less intimate acquaintances of Lovelace
like the ELECTRA PERILLA CORINNA c of Herrick But at the
same time an obscurity has hitherto hung over some of the persons
mentioned under fictitious names in the poems of Lovelace
which a little research and trouble would have easily removed
For instance no one who reads Amarantha a Pastoral
doubts that LUCASTA and AMARANTHA are one and the same person
ALEXIS is Lovelace himself ELLINDA is a female friend of
the poet who occasionally stayed at her house and on one
occasion p 79 had a serious illness there ELLINDA marries
AMYNTOR under which disguise I suspect lurks the well known
Maecenas of his time Endymion Porter If Porter be AMYNTOR of
course ELLINDA must be the Lady Olivia Porter his wife ARIGO
see the poem of AMYNTORS GROVE signifies Porters friend
Henry Jermyn It may be as well to add that the LETTICE mentioned
at p 121 was the Lady Lettice Goring wife of Lovelaces friend
and third daughter of Richard Boyle first Earl of Cork This lady
died before her husband to whom she brought no issue

The following lines are prefixed to FONS LACHRYMARUM c
by John Quarles 1648 8vo and are subscribed as will be seen
R L they may be from the pen of Lovelace but if so
it is strange that they were not admitted with other productions
of a similar character into the volume published by the poet
himself in 1649 or into that edited by his brother in 1659

 TO MY DEAR FRIEND THE AUTHOR

 The Son begins to rise the Fathers set
 Heavn took away one light and pleasd to let
 Another rise Quarles thy lights divine
 And it shall teach Darkness it self to shine
 Each word revives thy Fathers name his art

 The rare Endeavors of a modest mind
 Proceed as well as thou hast well begun
 That we may see the Father by the Son

The above has been partly derived from a communication to the
GENTLEMANS MAGAZINE for Dec 1791 by Sir Egerton Brydges
who chiefly compiled it from Hasted compared with Berrys
KENT GENEALOGIES 474 where there are a few inaccuracies
It is of course a mere skeletontree and furnishes no
information as to the collateral branches the connexion between
the houses of Stanley and Lovelace c Sir Egerton Brydges
series of articles on Lovelace in the GENTLEMANS MAGAZINE with
the exception of that from which the foregoing table is taken
does not contain much if anything that is new On the 3rd of
May 1577 Henry Binneman paid vipence and a copie to the
Stationers Company for the right to print the Briefe Course of
the Accidents of the Deathe of Mr Serjeant Lovelace and on the
30th of August following Richard Jones obtained a licence to print
A Short Epitaphe of Serjeant Lovelace This was the same person
who is described in the pedigree as dying in 1576 His death
happened no doubt like that of Sir Robert Bell and others at the
Oxford Summer assizes for 1576 See Stows ANNALES fol 1154

In 1563 Barnaby Googe the poet dedicated his EGLOGS EPITAPHES
AND SONNETTES NEWLY WRITTEN to the Ryght Worshypfull M Richard

The following is a list of the members of the Lovelace family
who belonged to the Honourable Society of Grays Inn from 1541
to 1646

 Francis Lovelace  1609 Perhaps the same who was Recorder
 of Canterbury in 1638
 Francis Lovelace  1640 Probably the poets younger
 of Canterbury brother
 William Lovelace  1646

For these names and dates I am indebted to the courtesy
of the Steward of Grays Inn

Sir William Lovelace the poets grandfather who according to
Berry died in 1629 was a correspondent of Sir Dudley Carleton
see CALENDARS OF STATE PAPERS DOMESTIC SERIES 161118 pp 443
521 533 Ibid 161823 p 17 It appears from some Latin lines
before the first portion of LUCASTA that the poets father served
with distinction in Holland and probably it was this circumstance
which led to Lovelace himself turning his attention in a similar
direction for the latter was on service in the Low Countries
perhaps under his father of whose death we do not know the date
though Hasted intimates that he fell at the Gryll when his friend
Tatham afterwards the city poet addressed to him some verses
printed in a volume entitled OSTELLA printed in 1650

22 Mr A Keightley Registrar of the Charterhouse with his
usual kindness examined for me the books of the institution
in the hope of finding the date of Lovelaces admission c
but without success Mr Keightley has suggested to me that
perhaps Lovelace was not on the foundation which is of course
highly probable and which as Mr Keightley seems to think
may account for the omission of his name from the registers

24 Bethersden is a parish in the Weald of Kent eastward
of Smarden near Surrenden The manor of Lovelace says Hasted
HISTORY OF KENT iii 239 is situated at a very small distance
SOUTHWESTWARD from the church of Bethersden It was in early
times the property of a family named Grunsted or Greenstreet
as they were sometimes called the last of whom HENRY DE GRUNSTED
a man of eminent repute as all the records of this county testify
in the reigns of both King Edward II and III passed away this
manor to KINET in which name it did not remain long for WILLIAM
KINET in the 41st year of King Edward III conveyed it by sale
to JOHN LOVELACE who erected that mansion here which from hence
bore his name in addition being afterwards styled BETHERSDENLOVELACE
from which sprang a race of gentlemen who in the
military line acquired great reputation and honour and by their
knowledge in the municipal laws deserved well of the Commonwealth
from whom descended those of this name seated at BAYFORD in
SITTINGBORNE and at KINGSDOWN in this county the Lords Lovelace
of Hurley and others of the county of Berks The same writer
in his HISTORY OF CANTERBURY has preserved many memorials
of the connexion of the Lovelaces from the earliest times
with Canterbury and its neighbourhood William Lovelace
in the reign of Philip and Mary died possessed of the mansion
belonging to the abbey of St Lawrence near Canterbury
after the death of his son William it passed to other hands
In 1621 Lancelot Lovelace Esq was Recorder of Canterbury
in 1638 Richard Lovelace Esq held that office and in the
year of the Restoration Richard Lovelace the poets brother was
Recorder In the Public Library at Plymouth there is a folio MS
mentioned in Mr Halliwells catalogue 1853 containing
Original Papers of the Molineux and LOVELACE Families I regret
that I have not had an opportunity of inspecting it Mr Halliwell
does not seem to have examined the volume at all events that
gentleman does not furnish any particulars as to the nature of the
contents or as to the period to which the papers belong This
information in the case of a MS deposited in a provincial library
in a remote district would have been peculiarly valuable It is
possible that the documents refer only to the Lovelaces of Hurley
co Berks

25 The Humble Petition of the Gentry Ministers and
Commonalty for the county of Kent agreed upon at the General
Assizes for that county See JOURNALS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS iv
67567 The framers and contrivers of this petition were Sir
Edward Dering Bart of SurrendenDering Sir Roger Twysden the
wellknown scholar Sir George Strode and Mr Richard Spencer On
the 21st May 1641 Dering had unsuccessfully attempted to bring in
a bill for the ABOLITION of church government by bishops
archbishops c whereas one of the articles of the petition of
1642 usually known as DERINGS PETITION was a prayer for the
restoration of the Liturgy and the maintenance of the episcopal
bench in its integrity A numerously signed petition had also
been addressed to both Houses by the county in 1641 in which
the strongest reasons were given for the adoption of Derings
proposed act From 1641 to 1648 indeed the Houses were
overwhelmed by Kentish petitions of various kinds This portion
of Woods narrative is confirmed by Marvells lines prefixed to
LUCASTA 1649

 And one the Book prohibits because Kent
 Their first Petition by the Authour sent

Sir William Boteler of Kent returning about the beginning of
APRIL 1642 from his attendance being then Gentleman Pentioner
on the king at YORKE then celebrating St GEORGES feast
was by the earnest solicitation of the Gentry of Kent ingaged
to joyn with them in presenting the most honest and famous Petition
of theirs to the House of Commons delivered by Captain RICHARD
LOVELACE for which service the Captain was committed Prisoner to
the GATE HOUSE and SIR WILLIAM BOTELER to the Fleet from whence
after some weeks close imprisonment no impeachment in all that
time brought in against him Boteler many Petitions being
delivered and read in the House for his inlargement he was at last
upon bail of pounds20000 pounds15000 remitted to his house
in LONDON to attend DE DIE IN DIEM the pleasure of the HouseMERCURIUS
RUSTICUS 1646 edit 1685 pp 7 8 The fact was
that although on the 7th of April 1642 the Kentish petition in
favour of the Liturgy c had been ordered by the House of Commons
to be burned by the common hangman PARLIAMENTS AND COUNCILS
OF ENGLAND 1839 p 384 Boteler and Lovelace had the temerity
on the 30th of the same month to come up to London and present it
again to the House It was this which occasioned their committal

following memorandum

in Tathams OSTELLA 1650 4to that Lovelace made a stay
in the Netherlands about this time if indeed he did not serve
there with his regiment

 UPON MY NOBLE FRIEND RICHARD LOVELACE ESQ HIS
 BEING IN HOLLAND AN INVITATION

 Come Adonis come again
 What distaste could drive thee hence
 Where so much delight did reign
 Sateing evn the soul of sense
 And though thou unkind hast provd
 Never youth was more belovd
 Then lovd Adonis come away
 For Venus brooks not thy delay

 Wert thou sated with the spoil
 Of so many virgin hearts
 And therefore didst change thy soil
 To seek fresh in other parts
 Dangers wait on foreign game
 We have deer more sound and tame
 Then lovd Adonis come away
 For Venus brooks not thy delay

 Phillis fed with thy delights
 In thy absence pines away
 And love too hath lost his rites
 Not one lass keeps holiday
 They have changed their mirth for cares
 And do onely sigh thy airs
 Then lovd Adonis come away
 For Venus brooks not thy delay

 Elpine in whose sager looks
 Thou wert wont to take delight
 Hath forsook his drink and books
 Cause he cant enjoy thy sight
 He hath laid his learning by
 Cause his wit wants company
 Then lovd Adonis come away
 For friendship brooks not thy delay

 All the swains that once did use
 To converse with Love and thee
 In the language of thy Muse
 Have forgot Loves deity
 They deny to write a line
 And do only talk of thine
 Then lovd Adonis come away
 For friendship brooks not thy delay

 By thy sweet Altheas voice
 We conjure thee to return
 Or well rob thee of that choice
 In whose flames each heart would burn
 That inspird by her and sack
 Such company we will not lack
 That poets in the age to come
 Shall write of our Elisium

29 Peter or rather PETRE House in Aldersgate Street
belonged at one time to the antient family by whose name it was
known The third Lord Petre dying in 1638 left it with other
possessions in and about the city of London to his son William
Collinss PEERAGE by Brydges vii 10 11 When Lovelace was
committed to Peter House and probably long before MERCURIUS
RUSTICUS ed 1685 pp 7679 this mansion was used as a house of
detention for political prisoners but in Wards DIARY ed Severn
p 167 there is the following entry like almost all Wards
entries unluckily without dateMy Lord Peters is an Essex man
hee hath a house in Aldersgate Street wherein lives the Marquis
of Dorchester implying that at that period perhaps about 1660
the premises still belonged to the Petre family though temporarily
let to Lord Dorchester Another celebrated house in the same
street was London House which continued for some time to be the
town residence of the Bishops of London When it had ceased to be
an episcopal abode it was adapted to the purposes of an ordinary
dwelling and among the occupants at a somewhat later period was
Tom Rawlinson the great bookcollector See Stow ed 1720 ii
lib iii p 121

210 How different was the conduct under similar circumstances
of the lady whom Charles Gerbier commemorates in his ELOGIUM
HEROINUM 1651 p 127 Democion the Athenian virgin he tells
us hearing that Leosthenes to whom she was contracted was slain
in the wars she killed herself but before her death she thus
reasoned with herself Although my body is untoucht yet should I
fall into the imbraces of another I should but deceive the second
since I am still married to the former in my heart

211 Woods story about LUCASTA having been a Lucy Sacheverell
a lady of great beauty and fortune may reasonably be doubted
Lucasta whoever she was seems to have belonged to Kent
the SACHEVERELLS were not a Kentish family Besides the
corruption of Lucy Sacheverell into Lucasta is not very obvious
and rather violent and the probability is that the author of
the ATHENAE was misled by his informant on this occasion
The plate etched by Lely and engraved by Faithorne which
is found in the second part of LUCASTA 1659 can scarcely
be regarded as a portrait it was in all likelihood a mere
fancy sketch and we are not perhaps far from the truth in our
surmise that the artist was nearly if not quite as much
in the dark as to who Lucasta was as we are ourselves
at the present day

212 This is a mistake on the part of Wood which with many
others ought to be corrected in a new edition of the ATHENAE
Lawes did not set to music AMARANTHA A PASTORAL nor any portion
of it but he harmonized two stanzas of a little poem to be found
at p 29 of the present volume and called To Amarantha that she
would dishevel her Hair

213 Hasted states that soon after the death of Charles I the
manor of LovelaceBethersden passed by purchase to Richard Hulse
Esq

214 On the titlepage of this portion of LUCASTA as well as
on that which had appeared in 1649 the author is expressly styled
RICHARD LOVELACE ESQ yet in Berrys KENT GENEALOGIES p 474
he is curiously enough called SIR Richard Lovelace KNT It is
scarcely necessary to observe that the error is on Berrys side

215 The most pleasing likeness of Lovelace the only one
indeed which conveys any just idea to us of the handsomest man of
his time is the picture at Dulwich which has been twice copied
in both instances with very indifferent success One of these
copies was made for Hardings BIOGRAPHICAL MIRROR Bromley
DICTIONARY OF ENGRAVED BRITISH PORTRAITS 1793 p 101 correctly
names Francis Lovelace the writers brother as the designer
of the portrait before the POSTHUME POEMS

216 Winstanley perhaps intended some allusion to these two
lost dramas from the pen of Lovelace when he thus characterizes
him in his LIVES OF THE POETS 1687 p 170I can compare no
man he says so like this Colonel LOVELACE as SIR PHILIP SIDNEY
of which latter it is said by one in an epitaph made of him

 Nor is it fit that more I should acquaint
 Lest men adore in one
 A Scholar SOULDIER Lover and a Saint

As to the comparison Winstanley must be understood to signify
a resemblance between Lovelace and Sydney as men rather than
as writers Winstanleys extract is from WITS RECREATIONS
but the text as he gives it varies from that printed by
the editor of the reprint of that work in 1817

217 Gunpowder Alley still exists but it is not the Gunpowder
Alley which Lovelace knew having been rebuilt more than once
since 1658 It is now a tolerably wide and airy court without
any conspicuous appearance of squalor There is no tradition
I am sorry to say respecting Lovelace all such recollections
have long been swept away When one of the old inhabitants
told me and there are one or two persons who have lived here
all their life that a great poet once resided thereabout
I naturally became eager to catch the name but it turned out
to be Dr Johnson not Lovelace the latter of whom might have
been contemporary with Homer for aught they knew to the contrary
in Gunpowder Alley It appears from Decker and Websters play
of WESTWARD HOE 1607 Websters Works ed Hazlitt i 67
that there was another Gunpowder Alley near Crutched Friars

218 Hone EVERYDAY BOOK ii 561 edit 1827 states
under date of April 28 that during this month in 1658
the accomplished Colonel Richard Lovelace died IN THE GATEHOUSE
AT WESTMINSTER whither he had been committed c No authority
however is given for in assertion so wholly at variance with
the received view on the subject and I am afraid that Hone has
here fallen into a mistake

219 Aubrey in what are called his LIVES OF EMINENT MEN
but which are in fact merely rough biographical memoranda
states under the head of LovelaceObiit in a cellar in
Long acre a little before the restauration of his Matie
Mr Edm WyldAN1 c had made collections for him
and given him moneyGeo Petty haberdasher in Fleet street
carried xxshillings to him every Monday morning from SrMany
and Charles Cotton Esq formoneths BUT WAS NEVER REPAYD
Aubrey was certainly a contemporary of Lovelace and Wood seems
to have been indebted to him for a good deal of information
but all who are acquainted with Aubrey are probably aware that
he took in many instances very little trouble to examine for
himself but accepted statements on hearsay Wood does not
in the case of Lovelace adopt Aubreys account and it is to
be observed that IF the poet died as poor as he is represented
by both writers to have died he would have been buried by the
parish and dying in Long Acre the parochial authorities would
not have carried him to Fleet Street for sepulture

AN1 P xxiv MR EDMUND WYLD
This gentleman the friend of Aubrey Author of the MISCELLANIES
c and  the son of Sir Edmund Wyld seems to have furnished
the former with a variety of information on matters of current
interest See Thoms ANECDOTES AND TRADITIONS 1839 p 99
He is no doubt the E W Esq whom Aubrey cites as his
authority on one or two occasions in his REMAINS OF GENTILISM
AND JUDAISM He was evidently a person of the most benevolent
character and Aubrey LIVES OF EMINENT MEN ii 483 pays him
a handsome tribute where he describes him as a great fautor
of ingenious and good men for meer merits sake

220 See p 149 NOTE 3ie note 634 His acquaintance
with Hellenic literature possibly extended very little beyond
the pages of the ANTHOLOGIA

221 His favourites appear to have been Ausonius and Catullus

222 On the 5th May 1642 a counterpetition was presented
by some Kentish gentlemen to the House of Commons disclaiming
and condemning the former oneJOURNALS OF THE H OF C ii 558

HouseJOURNALS ii 629

224 This property which was of considerable extent and value
was purchased of the Cheney family toward the latter part
of the reign of Henry VI by Richard Lovelace of Queenhithe

225 I do not think that there is any proof that Gunpowderalley
was at the time when Lovelace resided there a particularly poor
or mean locality

226 See Lambarde PERAMBULATION OF KENT 1570 ed 1826
p 533

227 As so little is known of the personal history of Lovelace
the reader may not be displeased to see this Dedication and it is
therefore subjoined

 To my Noble Friend And Gossip CAPTAIN RICHARD LOVELACE
 Sir
 I have so long beene in your debt that I am almost desperate
 in my selfe of making you paiment till this fancy by
 ravishing from you a new curtesie in its patronage promised
 me it would satisfie part of my former engagements to you
 Wonder not to see it invade you thus on the sudden gratitude
 is aeriall and like that element nimble in its motion and
 performance though I would not have this of mine of a French
 disposition to charge hotly and retreat unfortunately there
 may appeare something in this that may maintaine the field
 courageously against Envy nay come off with honour if you
 Sir please to rest satisfied that it marches under your
 ensignes which are the desires of
 Your true honourer
 Hen Glapthorne

228 It has never so far as I am aware been suggested that
the friend to whom Sir John Suckling addressed his capital ballad

 I tell thee Dick where I have been

may have been Lovelace It was a very usual practice then even
more so than now among familiar acquaintances to use the
abbreviated Christian name in addressing each other thus Suckling
was JACK Davenant WILL Carew TOM c in the preceding
generation Marlowe had been KIT Jonson BEN Greene ROBIN and so
forth and although there is no positive proof that Lovelace and
Suckling were intimate it is extremely probable that such was the
case more especially as they were not only brother poets but both
country gentlemen belonging to neighbouring counties Suckling
had besides some taste and aptitude for military affairs and
could discourse about strategics in a city tavern over a bowl of
canary with the author of LUCASTA notwithstanding that he was a
little troubled by nervousness according to report when the
enemy was too near

229 From Andrew Marvells lines prefixed to LUCASTA 1649
it seems that Lovelace and himself were on tolerably good terms
and that when the former presented the Kentish petition and was
imprisoned for so doing his friends who exerted themselves to
procure his release suspected Marvell of a share in his disgrace
which Marvell according to his own account earnestly disclaimed
See the lines commencing

 But when the beauteous ladies came to know c

To the faire bright Magazin
Hath impoverisht Loves Queen
To th Exchequer of all honour
All take pensions but from her
To the taper of the thore
Which the god himselfe but bore
To the Sea of Chaste Delight
Let me cast the Drop I write
 And as at Lorettos shrine
Caesar shovels in his mine
Th Empres spreads her carkanets
The lords submit their coronets
Knights their chased armes hang by
Maids diamondruby fancies tye
Whilst from the pilgrim she wears
One poore false pearl but ten true tears
 So among the Orient prize
Saphyronyx eulogies
Offerd up unto your fame
Take my GARNETDUBLET name
And vouchsafe midst those rich joyes
With devotion these TOYES

Lovelace who suffered so severely for his attachment to the Kings
cause and daughter to the equally unfortunate Thomas Earl of
Cleveland who was equally devoted to his sovereign and whose
estates were ordered by the Parliament to be sold July 26 1650

 VERSES ADDRESSED TO THE AUTHOR



 TO MY BEST BROTHER ON HIS POEMS CALLED LUCASTA

Now y have obliegd the age thy wel known worth
Is to our joy auspiciously brought forth
Good morrow to thy son thy first borne flame
Which as thou gavst it birth stamps it a name
That Fate and a discerning age shall set
The chiefest jewell in her coronet

Why then needs all this paines those seasond pens
That standing lifeguard to a booke kinde friends
That with officious care thus guard thy gate
As if thy Child were illigitimate
Forgive their freedome since unto their praise
They write to give not to dispute thy bayes

As when some glorious queen whose pregnant wombe
Brings forth a kingdome with her firstborne Sonne
Marke but the subjects joyfull hearts and eyes
Some offer gold and others sacrifice
This slayes a lambe that not so rich as hee
Brings but a dove this but a bended knee
And though their giftes be various yet their sence
Speaks only this one thought Long live the prince

So my best brother if unto your name
I offer up a thin blewburning flame
Pardon my love since none can make thee shine
Vnlesse they kindle first their torch at thine
Then as inspird they boldly write nay that
Which their amazed lights but twinkld at
And their illustrate thoughts doe voice this right
Lucasta held their torch thou gavst it light
 Francis Lovelace Col

 ON THE POEMS

How humble is thy muse Deare that can daign
Such servants as my pen to entertaine
When all the sonnes of wit glory to be
Clad in thy muses gallant livery
I shall disgrace my master prove a staine
And no addition to his honourd traine
Though all that read me will presume to swear
I neer read thee yet if it may appear
I love the writer and admire the writ
I my owne want betray not wrong thy wit
Did thy worke want a prayse my barren brain
Could not afford it my attempt were vaine
It needs no foyle All that ere writ before
Are foyles to thy faire Poems and no more
Then to be lodgd in the same sheets with thine
May prove disgrace to yours but grace to mine
 Norris Jephson Col



 TO MY MUCH LOVED FRIEND RICHARD LOVELACE Esq

 CARMEN EROTICUM

Deare Lovelace I am now about to prove
I cannot write a verse but can write love
On such a subject as thy booke I cood
Write books much greater but not half so good
But as the humble tenant that does bring
A chicke or egges fors offering
Is tane into the buttry and does fox51
Equall with him that gave a stalled oxe
So since the heart of evry cheerfull giver
Makes pounds no more accepted than a stiver52
Though som thy prayse in rich stiles sing I may
In stiverstile write love as well as they
I write so well that I no criticks feare
For whole read mine when as thy bookes so neer
Vnlesse thy selfe then you shall secure mine
From those and Ile engage my selfe for thine
Theyl dot themselves thee this allay youl take
I love thy book and yet not for thy sake
 John Jephson Col53

51 TO FOX usually means to intoxicate To fox oneself
is TO GET DRUNK and to fox a person is TO MAKE HIM DRUNK
The word in this sense belongs to the cant vocabulary
But in the present case fox merely signifies TO FARE or TO FEAST

52 A Dutch penny It is very likely that this individual
had served with the poet in Holland

53 Three members of this family or at least three persons
of this name probably related figure in the history of the
present period viz Colonel John Jephson apparently a military
associate of Lovelace Norris Jephson who contributed a copy
of verses to LUCASTA and to the first folio edition of Beaumont
and Fletchers plays 1647 and William Jephson whose name occurs
among the subscribers to the SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT 1643



 TO MY NOBLE AND MOST INGENIOUS FRIEND
 COLONEL RICHARD LOVELACE UPON HIS LUCASTA

So from the pregnant braine of Jove did rise
Pallas the queene of wit and beautious eyes
As faire Lucasta from thy temples flowes
Temples no lesse ingenious then Joves
Alike in birth so shall she be in fame
And be immortall to preserve thy Name



 ANOTHER UPON THE POEMS

Now when the wars augment our woes and fears
And the shrill noise of drums oppresse our ears
Now peace and safety from our shores are fled
To holes and cavernes to secure their head
Now all the graces from the land are sent
And the nine Muses suffer banishment
Whence spring these raptures whence this heavenly rime
So calme and even in so harsh a time
Well might that charmer his faire Caelia61 crowne
And that more polisht Tyterus62 renowne
His Sacarissa when in groves and bowres
They could repose their limbs on beds of flowrs
When wit had prayse and merit had reward
And every noble spirit did accord
To love the Muses and their priests to raise
And interpale their browes with flourishing bayes
But in a time distracted so to sing
When peace is hurried hence on rages wing
When the fresh bayes are63 from the Temple torne
And every art and science made a scorne
Then to raise up by musicke of thy art
Our drooping spirits and our grieved hearts
Then to delight our souls and to inspire
Our breast with pleasure from thy charming lyre
Then to divert our sorrowes by thy straines
Making us quite forget our seven yeers paines
In the past wars unlesse that Orpheus be
A sharer in thy glory for when he
Descended downe for his Euridice
He stroke his lute with like admired art
And made the damned to forget their smart

Pinchback neither is nor was I believe a name of common
occurrence and it is just possible that the Colonel may be the
very old Jack Pinchbacke mentioned by Sir Nicholas LEstrange
in his MERRY PASSAGES AND JESTS of which a selection was given
by Mr Thoms in his ANECDOTES AND TRADITIONS 1839 LEstrange
it is true describes the Colonel as a gamester and rufler
daubed with gold lace but this is not incompatible with the
identity between the PINCHBACKE who figures in LUCASTA and
OLD JACK who had perhaps not always been a gamester and ruffler
and whose gold lace had no doubt once been in better company than
that which he seems to have frequented when LEstrange knew him
The daubed gold lace after all only corresponds with the
picture which Lovelace himself may have presented in GUNPOWDER
ALLEY days

 TO HIS MUCH HONOURED FRIEND MR RICHARD LOVELACE ON HIS POEMS

He that doth paint the beauties of your verse
Must use your pensil be polite soft terse
Forgive that man whose best of art is love
If he no equall master to you prove
My heart is all my eloquence and that
Speaks sharp affection when my words fall flat
I reade you like my mistresse and discry
In every line the quicknesse of her eye
Her smoothnesse in each syllable her grace
To marshall evry word in the right place
It is the excellence and soule of wit
When evry thing is free as well as fit
For metaphors packt up and crowded close
Swath ye minds sweetnes and display the throws
And like those chickens hatcht in furnaces
Produce or one limbe more or one limbe lesse
Then nature bids Survey such when they write
No clause buts justld with an epithite
So powerfully you draw when you perswade
Passions in you in us are vertues made
Such is the magick of that lawfull shell
That where it doth but talke it doth compell
 For no Apelles till this time ere drew
 A Venus to the waste so well as you

The world shall now no longer mourne nor vex
For th obliquity of a crossgraind sex
Nor beauty swell above her bankes and made
For ornament the universe invade
So fiercely that tis questiond in our bookes
Whether kils most the Amazons sword or lookes
Lucasta in loves game discreetly makes
Women and men joyntly to share the stakes
And lets us know when women scorne it is
Mens hot love makes the antiparisthesis
And a lay lover here such comfort finds
As Holy Writ gives to affected minds
The wilder nymphs lovs power could not comand
Are by thy almighty numbers brought to hand
And flying Daphnes caught amazed vow
They never heard Apollo court till now
Tis not by force of armes this feat is done
For that would puzzle even the Knight o th Sun81
But tis by powr of art and such a way
As Orpheus usd when he made fiends obay

old writers Sir Thomas Overbury in his CHARACTERS represents

 TO HIS NOBLE FRIEND MR RICHARD LOVELACE UPON HIS POEMS

SIR
 Ovr times are much degenerate from those
Which your sweet Muse which your fair fortune chose
And as complexions alter with the climes
Our wits have drawne th infection of our times
That candid age no other way could tell
To be ingenious but by speaking well
Who best could prayse had then the greatest prayse
Twas more esteemd to give then wear the bayes
Modest ambition studid only then
To honour not her selfe but worthy men
These vertues now are banisht out of towne
Our Civill Wars have lost the civicke crowne
He highest builds who with most art destroys
And against others fame his owne employs
I see the envious caterpillar sit
On the faire blossome of each growing wit
 The ayres already tainted with the swarms
Of insects which against you rise in arms
Wordpeckers paperrats bookscorpions
Of wit corrupted the unfashiond sons
The barbed censurers begin to looke
Like the grim Consistory on thy booke
And on each line cast a reforming eye
Severer then the yong presbytery
Till when in vaine they have thee all perusd
You shall for being faultlesse be accusd
Some reading your LUCASTA will alledge
You wrongd in her the Houses priviledge
Some that you under sequestration are
Because you write when going to the Warre
And one the book prohibits because Kent
Their first Petition by the Authour sent
 But when the beauteous ladies came to know
That their deare Lovelace was endangerd so
Lovelace that thawd the most congealed brest
He who lovd best and them defended best
Whose hand so rudely grasps the steely brand
Whose hand so gently melts the ladies hand
They all in mutiny though yet undrest
Sallyd and would in his defence contest
And one the loveliest that was yet ere seen
Thinking that I too of the rout had been
Mine eyes invaded with a female spight
She knew what pain t would be to lose that sight
O no mistake not I replyd for I
In your defence or in his cause would dy
But he secure of glory and of time
Above their envy or mine aid doth clime
Him valianst men and fairest nymphs approve
His booke in them finds judgement with you love
 Andr Marvell



 TO COLONEL RICHARD LOVELACE
ON THE PUBLISHING OF HIS INGENIOUS POEMS

 If the desire of glory speak a mind
More nobly operative and more refind
What vast soule moves thee or what heros spirit
Kept ints traduction pure dost thou inherit
That not contented with one single fame
Dost to a double glory spread thy name
And on thy happy temples safely set
Both th Delphick wreath and civic coronet
 Wast not enough for us to know how far
Thou couldst in season suffer act and dare
But we must also witnesse with what height
And what Ionick sweetnesse thou canst write
And melt those eager passions that are
Stubborn enough t enrage the god of war
Into a noble love which may expire91
In an illustrious pyramid of fire
Which having gained his due station may
Fix there and everlasting flames display
This is the braver path time soone can smother
The dearbought spoils and tropheis of the other
How many fiery heroes have there been
Whose triumphs were as soone forgot as seen
Because they wanted some diviner one
To rescue thee from night and make thee known
 Such art thou to thy selfe While others dream
Strong flattries on a faind or borrowd theam
Thou shalt remaine in thine owne lustre bright
And adde unto t LUCASTAS chaster light
 For none so fit to sing great things as he
That can act ore all lights of poetry
Thus had Achilles his owne gests designd
He had his genius Homer far outshind

 TO THE HONORABLE VALIANT AND INGENIOUS COLONEL RICHARD LOVELACE
 ON HIS EXQUISITE POEMS

 Poets and painters have some near relation
Compard with fancy and imagination
The one paints shadowed persons in pure kind
The other paints the pictures of the mind
In purer verse And as rare Zeuxes fame
Shind till Apelles art eclipsd the same
By a more exquisite and curious line
In Zeuxeses with pensill far more fine
So have our modern poets late done well
Till thine appeard which scarce have paralel
 They like to Zeuxes grapes beguile the sense
But thine do ravish the intelligence
Like the rare banquet of Apelles drawn
And covered over with most curious lawn
 Thus if thy careles draughts are cald the best
What would thy lines have beene hadst thou profest
That faculty infusd of poetry
Which adds such honour unto thy chivalry
Doubtles thy verse had all as far transcended
As Sydneyes Prose who Poets once defended
 For when I read thy much renowned pen
My fancy there finds out another Ben
In thy brave language judgement wit and art
Of every piece of thine in every part
Where thy seraphique Sydneyan fire is raised high
In valour vertue love and loyalty
 Virgil was styld the loftiest of all
Ovid the smoothest and most naturall
Martiall concise and witty quaint and pure
Iuvenall grave and learned though obscure
 But all these rare ones which I heere reherse
Do live againe in Thee and in thy Verse
Although not in the language of their time
Yet in a speech as copious and sublime
 The rare Apelles in thy picture wee
Perceive and in thy soule Apollo see
Wel may each Grace and Muse then crown thy praise
With Mars his banner and Minervas bayes
 Fra Lenton101

and other poetical works Singer does not give these lines

of the time of Charles I to which Lovelace might have sat
had he been old enough at the time But Lenton had no want
of sitters for his portrait



 TO HIS HONOURED AND INGENIOUS FRIEND COLONEL RICHARD LOVELACE
 ON HIS LUCASTA

Chast as Creation meant us and more bright
Then the first day in s uneclipsed light
Is thy LUCASTA and thou offerest heere
Lines to her name as undefild and cleere
Such as the first indeed more happy dayes
When vertue wit and learning wore the bayes
Now vice assumes would to her memory give
A Vestall flame that should for ever live
Plact in a christal temple reard to be
The Embleme of her thoughts integrity
And on the porch thy name insculpt my friend
Whose love like to the flame can know no end
The marble step that to the alter brings
The hallowed priests with their clean offerings
Shall hold their names that humbly crave to be
Votaries to th shrine and grateful friends to thee
So shal we live although our offrings prove
Meane to the world for ever by thy love
 Tho Rawlins111

 TO MY DEAR BROTHER COLONEL RICHARD LOVELACE

Ile doe my nothing too and try
To dabble to thy memory
Not that I offer to thy name
Encomiums of thy lasting fame
Those by the landed have been writ
Mines but a yongerbrother wit
A wit thats hudled up in scarres
Borne like my rough selfe in the warres
And as a Squire in the fight
Serves only to attend the Knight
So tis my glory in this field
Where others act to beare thy shield

 TO LUCASTA GOING BEYOND THE SEAS

 I
 If to be absent were to be
 Away from thee
 Or that when I am gone
 You or I were alone
Then my LUCASTA might I crave
Pity from blustring winde or swallowing wave

 II
 But Ile not sigh one blast or gale
 To swell my saile
 Or pay a teare to swage
 The foaming blewgods rage
For whether he will let me passe
Or no Im still as happy as I was

 III
 Though seas and land betwixt us both
 Our faith and troth
 Like separated soules
 All time and space controules
Above the highest sphere wee meet
Unseene unknowne and greet as angels greet

 IV
 So then we doe anticipate
 Our afterfate
 And are alive ith skies
 If thus our lips and eyes
Can speake like spirits unconfind
In Heavn their earthy bodies left behind

Of thy chaste breast and quiet minde

And with a stronger faith imbrace
 A sword a horse a shield

Yet this inconstancy is such
 As you too shall adore
I could not love thee dear so much
 Lovd I not Honour more



 A PARADOX

 I
Tis true the beauteous Starre171
 To which I first did bow
Burnt quicker brighter far
 Than that which leads me now
 Which shines with more delight
 For gazing on that light
 So long neere lost my sight

 II
Through foul we follow faire
 For had the world one face
And earth been bright as ayre
 We had knowne neither place
 Indians smell not their neast
 A Swisse or Finne tastes best
 The spices of the East172

 III
So from the glorious Sunne
 Who to his height hath got
With what delight we runne
 To some black cave or grot
 And heavnly Sydney you
 Twice read had rather view
 Some odde romance so new

 IV
The god that constant keepes
 Unto his deities
Is poore in joyes and sleepes
 Imprisond in the skies
 This knew the wisest who
 From Juno stole below
 To love a bear or cow

 As my curious hand or eye
Hovering round thee let it flye

As its calme ravisher the winde
 Who hath left his darling th East
To wanton ore that183 spicie neast

 Evry tresse must be confest
But neatly tangled at the best
 Like a clue of golden thread
Most excellently ravelled

 IV
 Doe not then winde up that light
In ribands and oercloud in night
 Like the sun ins early ray
But shake your head and scatter day

 V
 See tis broke within this grove
The bower and the walkes of love
 Weary lye we downe and rest
And fanne each others panting breast

 VI
 Heere weell strippe and coole our fire
In creame below in milkbaths184 higher
 And when all wells are drawne dry
Ill drink a teare out of thine eye

 VII
 Which our very joys shall leave
That sorrowes thus we can deceive
 Or our very sorrowes weepe
That joyes so ripe so little keepe

 Full of spite and envy blowne
At her constant marble heart
He drawes his swiftest surest dart
 Which bounded back and hit his owne

 Flames in the luster of her eyes
Triumphant she refuses scornes
He submits adores and mournes
 And is his votresse sacrifice

Ah me the little tyrant theefe
 As once my heart was playing
He snatcht it up and flew away
 Laughing at all my praying

 II
Proud of his purchase201 he surveys
 And curiously sounds it
And though he sees it full of wounds
 Cruel one still202 he wounds it

 III
And now this heart is all his sport
 Which as a ball he boundeth
From hand to breast from breast to lip
 And all its203 rest confoundeth

 IV
Then as a top he sets it up
 And pitifully whips it
Sometimes he cloathes it gay and fine
 Then straight againe he strips it

 V
He coverd it with false reliefe204
 Which gloriously showd it
And for a morningcushionet
 Ons mother he bestowd it

 VI
Each day with her small brazen stings
 A thousand times she racd it
But then at night bright with her gemmes
 Once neere her breast she placd it

 VII
There warme it gan to throb and bleed
 She knew that smart and grieved
At length this poore condemned heart
 With these rich drugges repreeved

 VIII
She washt the wound with a fresh teare
 Which my LUCASTA dropped
And in the sleave205silke of her haire
 Twas hard bound up and wrapped

 IX
She proabd it with her constancie
 And found no rancor nigh it
Only the anger of her eye
 Had wrought some proud flesh by it

 X
Then prest she narde in evry veine
 Which from her kisses trilled
And with the balme heald all its paine
 That from her hand distilled

 XI
But yet this heart avoyds me still
 Will not by me be owned
Buts fled to its physitians breast
 There proudly sits inthroned

Alex But part we when thy figure I retaine
 Still in my heart still strongly in mine eye
Lu Shadowes no longer than the sun remaine
 But whee his beams that made em fly they fly
Cho Vaine dreames of love that only so much blisse
 Allow us as to know our wretchednesse
 And deale a larger measure in our paine
 By showing joy then hiding it againe

 II
But when her teares his heate orecame
 In cloudes he quensht his beames
And grievd wept out his eye of flame
 So drowned her sad streames

 III241
At this she smiled when straight the sun
 Cleerd by her kinde desires
And by her eyes reflexion
 Fast kindld there his fires

241 This stanza is not found in the printed copy of LUCASTA
1649 but it occurs in a MS of this poem written with many
compositions by Lovelace and other poets in a copy of Crashaws
POEMS 1648 12mo a portion of which having been formed of the
printers proofsheets some of the pages are printed only on one
side the reverse being covered with MSS poems among the rest
with epigrams by MR THOMAS FULLER about fifty in number There
can be little doubt from the character of the majority of these
little poems that by Mr Thomas Fuller we may understand the
churchhistorian



 TO LUCASTA FROM PRISON
 AN EPODE251

 I
Long in thy shackels liberty
I ask not from these walls but thee
Left for awhile anothers bride
To fancy all the world beside

 II
Yet ere I doe begin to love
See how I all my objects prove
Then my free soule to that confine
Twere possible I might call mine

 III
First I would be in love with PEACE
And her rich swelling breasts increase
But how alas how may that be
Despising earth she will love me

 IV
Faine would I be in love with WAR
As my deare just avenging star
But War is lovd so evrywhere
Evn he disdaines a lodging here

 V
Thee and thy wounds I would bemoane
Faire thoroughshot RELIGION
But he lives only that kills thee
And who so bindes thy hands is free

 VI
I would love a PARLIAMENT
As a maine prop from Heavn sent
But ah whos he that would be wedded
To th fairest body thats beheaded

 VII
Next would I court my LIBERTY
And then my birthright PROPERTY
But can that be when it is knowne
Theres nothing you can call your owne

 VIII
A REFORMATION I would have
As for our griefes a SOVRAIGNE salve
That is a cleansing of each wheele
Of state that yet some rust doth feele

 IX
But not a reformation so
As to reforme were to orethrow
Like watches by unskilfull men
Disjoynted and set ill againe

 X
The PUBLICK FAITH252 I would adore
But she is bankerupt of her store
Nor how to trust her can I see
For she that couzens all must me

 XI
Since then none of these can be
Fit objects for my love and me
What then remaines but th only spring
Of all our loves and joyes the King

 XII
He who being the whole ball
Of day on earth lends it to all
When seeking to ecclipse his right
Blinded we stand in our owne light

 XIII
And now an universall mist
Of error is spread ore each breast
With such a fury edgd as is
Not found in th inwards of th abysse

 XIV
Oh from thy glorious starry waine
Dispense on me one sacred beame
To light me where I soone may see
How to serve you and you trust me

251 This was written perhaps during the poets confinement
in Peterhouse to which he was committed a prisoner on his return
from abroad in 1648 At the date of its composition there can be
little doubt from expressions in stanzas vi and xii that the
fortunes of Charles I were at their lowest ebb and it may be
assigned without much risk of error to the end of 1648

252 The publick faith why tis a word of kin
 A nephew that dares COZEN any sin
 A term of art great BEHOMOTHS younger brother
 Old MACHAVIEL and half a thousand other
 Which when subscribd writes LEGION names on truss

 LUCASTAS FANNE WITH A LOOKINGGLASSE IN IT261

 I
Eastrich262 thou featherd foole and easie prey
 That larger sailes to thy broad vessell needst
Snakes through thy gutturneck hisse all the day
 Then on thy iron messe at supper feedst263

 II
O what a glorious transmigration
 From this to so divine an edifice
Hast thou straight made heere264 from a winged stone
 Transformd into a bird of paradice

 III
Now doe thy plumes for hiew and luster vie
 With th arch of heavn that triumphs ore past wet
And in a rich enameld pinion lye
 With saphyres amethists and opalls set

 IV
Sometime they wing her side265 thee strive to drown
 The days eyes piercing beames whose amrous heat
Sollicites still till with this shield of downe
 From her brave face his glowing fires are beat

 V
But whilst a plumy curtaine she doth draw
 A chrystall mirror sparkles in thy breast
In which her fresh aspect when as she saw
 And then her foe266 retired to the west

 VI
Deare engine that oth sun gotst me the day
 Spite of his hot assaults madst him retreat
No wind said she dare with thee henceforth play
 But mine own breath to coole the tyrants heat

 VII
My lively shade thou ever shalt retaine
 In thy inclosed featherframed glasse
And but unto our selves to all remaine
 Invisible thou feature of this face

 VIII
So said her sad swaine overheard and cried
 Yee Gods for faith unstaind this a reward
Feathers and glasse toutweigh my vertue tryed
 Ah show their empty strength the gods accord

 IX
Now falln the brittle favourite lyes and burst
 Amasd LUCASTA weepes repents and flies
To her ALEXIS vowes her selfe acurst
 If hence she dresse her selfe but in his eyes

261 This adaptation of the fan to the purposes of a mirror
now so common was as we here are told familiar to the ladies
of Lovelaces time Mr Fairholt in his COSTUME IN ENGLAND
1846 p 496 describes many various forms which were given at
different periods to this article of use and ornament but the
present passage in LUCASTA appears to have escaped his notice

262 Ostrich Lyly in his EUPHUES 1579 sig c 4
has ESTRIDGE The fan here described was composed of
ostrichfeathers set with precious stones

263 In allusion to the digestive powers of this bird

264 Original reads NEERE

265 The poet means that Lucasta when she did not require
her fan for immediate use wore it suspended at her side or
from her girdle

266 The sun



 LUCASTA TAKING THE WATERS AT TUNBRIDGE271

 I
Yee happy floods that now must passe
 The sacred conduicts of her wombe
Smooth and transparent as your face
 When you are deafe and windes are dumbe

 II
Be proud and if your waters be
 Fould with a counterfeyted teare
Or some false sigh hath stained yee
 Haste and be purified there

 III
And when her rosie gates yhave tracd
 Continue yet some Orient wet
Till turnd into a gemme yare placd
 Like diamonds with rubies set

 IV
Yee drops that dew th Arabian bowers
 Tell me did you ere smell or view
On any leafe of all your flowers
 Soe sweet a sent so rich a hiew

 V
But as through th Organs of her breath
 You trickle wantonly beware
Ambitious Seas in their just death
 As well as Lovers must have share

 VI
And see you boyle as well as I
 You that to coole her did aspire
Now troubled and neglected lye
 Nor can your selves quench your owne fire

 VII
Yet still be happy in the thought
 That in so small a time as this
Through all the Heavens you were brought
 Of Vertue Honour Love and Blisse

271 From this it might be conjectured though the ground for
doing so would be very slight that LUCASTA was a native of Kent
or of one of the adjoining shires but against this supposition
we have to set the circumstance that elsewhere this lady is called
a northern star



 TO LUCASTA
 ODE LYRICK

 I
Ah LUCASTA why so bright
Spread with early streaked light
If still vailed from our sight
What ist but eternall night

 II
Ah LUCASTA why so chaste
With that vigour ripenes gract
Not to be by Man imbract
Makes that Royall coyne imbacet
And this golden Orchard waste

 III
Ah LUCASTA why so great
That thy crammed coffers sweat
Yet not owner of a seat
May shelter you from Natures heat
And your earthly joyes compleat

 IV
Ah Lucasta why so good
Blest with an unstained flood
Flowing both through soule and blood
If it be not understood
Tis a Diamond in mud

 V
LUCASTA stay why dost thou flye
Thou art not bright but to the eye
Nor chaste but in the mariagetye
Nor great but in this treasurie
Nor good but in that sanctitie

 VI
Harder then the Orient stone
Like an apparition
Or as a pale shadow gone
Dumbe and deafe she hence is flowne

 VII
Then receive this equall dombe
Virgins strow no teare or bloome
No one dig the Parian wombe
Raise her marble heart ith roome
And tis both her coarse and tombe



 LUCASTA PAYING HER OBSEQUIES TO THE CHAST MEMORY
 OF MY DEAREST COSIN MRS BOWES BARNES281

 I
See what an undisturbed teare
 She weepes for her last sleepe
But viewing her straight wakd a Star
 She weepes that she did weepe

 II
Griefe nere before did tyranize
 On th honour of that brow
And at the wheeles of her brave eyes
 Was captive led til now

 III
Thus for a saints apostacy
 The unimagind woes
And sorrowes of the Hierarchy
 None but an angel knowes

 IV
Thus for lost soules recovery
 The clapping of all wings
And triumphs of this victory
 None but an angel sings

 V
So none but she knows to bemone
 This equal virgins fate
None but LUCASTA can her crowne
 Of glory celebrate

 VI
Then dart on me CHAST LIGHT282 one ray
 By which I may discry
Thy joy cleare through this cloudy day
 To dresse my sorrow by

281 This lady was probably the wife of a descendant of
Sir William Barnes of Woolwich whose only daughter and heir
Anne married the poets father and brought him the seat in Kent

Oh stay that covetous hand first turn all eye
All depth and minde then mystically spye
Her souls faire picture her faire souls in all

 LUCASTAS WORLD
 EPODE

 I
Cold as the breath of winds that blow
To silver shot descending snow
 Lucasta sight301 when she did close
 The world in frosty chaines
 And then a frowne to rubies frose
 The blood boyld in our veines
Yet cooled not the heat her sphere
Of beauties first had kindled there

 II
Then movd and with a suddaine flame
Impatient to melt all againe
 Straight from her eyes she lightning hurld
 And earth in ashes mournes
 The sun his blaze denies the world
 And in her luster burnes
Yet warmed not the hearts her nice
Disdaine had first congeald to ice

 III
And now her teares nor grievd desire
Can quench this raging pleasing fire
 Fate but one way allowes behold
 Her smiles divinity
 They fannd this heat and thawd that cold
 So framd up a new sky
Thus earth from flames and ice repreevd
Ere since hath in her sunshine livd

301 Original reads SIGHT



 THE APOSTACY OF ONE AND BUT ONE LADY

 I
That frantick errour I adore
 And am confirmd the earth turns round
Now satisfied ore and ore
 As rowling waves so flowes the ground
And as her neighbour reels the shore
 Finde such a woman says she loves
 Shes that fixt heavn which never moves

 II
In marble steele or porphyrie
 Who carves or stampes his armes or face
Lookes it by rust or storme must dye
 This womans love no time can raze
Hardned like ice in the suns eye
 Or your reflection in a glasse
 Which keepes possession though you passe

 III
We not behold a watches hand
 To stir nor plants or flowers to grow
Must we infer that this doth stand
 And therefore that those do not blow
This she acts calmer like Heavns brand
 The stedfast lightning slow loves dart
 She kils but ere we feele the smart

 IV
Oh she is constant as the winde
 That revels in an evnings aire
Certaine as wayes unto the blinde
 More reall then her flattries are
Gentle as chaines that honour binde
 More faithfull then an Hebrew Jew
 But as the divel not halfe so true



 AMYNTOR311 FROM BEYOND THE SEA TO ALEXIS312

 A DIALOGUE

 Amyntor
 Alexis ah Alexis can it be
 Though so much wet and drie
 Doth drowne our eye
 Thou keepst thy winged voice from me

 Alexis
 Amyntor a profounder sea I feare
 Hath swallowd me where now
 My armes do row
 I floate ith ocean of a teare

 Lucasta weepes lest I look back and tread
 Your Watry land againe
Amyn Id through the raine
 Such showrs are quickly overspread

 Conceive how joy after this short divorce
 Will circle her with beames
 When like your streames
 You shall rowle back with kinder force

 And call the helping winds to vent your thought
Alex Amyntor Chloris where
 Or in what sphere
 Say may that glorious fair be sought

Amyn Shes now the center of these armes ere blest
 Whence may she never move
 Till Time and Love
 Haste to their everlasting rest

Alex Ah subtile swaine doth not my flame rise high
 As yours and burne as hot
 Am not I shot
 With the selfe same artillery

 And can I breath without her airAmyn
 Why then
 From thy tempestuous earth
 Where blood and dearth
 Raigne stead of kings agen

 Wafte thy selfe over and lest storms from far
 Arise bring in our sight
 The seas delight
 Lucasta that bright northerne star

Alex But as we cut the rugged deepe I feare
 The green god stops his fell
 Chariot of shell
 And smooths the maine to ravish her

Amyn Oh no the prince of waters fires are done
 He as his empires old
 And rivers cold
 His queen now runs abed to th sun

 But all his treasure he shall ope that day
 Tritons shall sound his fleete
 In silver meete
 And to her their rich offrings pay

Alex We flye Amyntor not amazd how sent
 By water earth or aire
 Or if with her
 By fire evn there
 I move in mine owne element

 CALLING LUCASTA FROM HER RETIREMENT
 ODE

 I
From the dire monument of thy black roome
Wher now that vestal flame thou dost intombe
As in the inmost cell of all earths wombe

 II
Sacred Lucasta like the powrfull ray
Of heavenly truth passe this Cimmerian way
Whilst all the standards of your beames display

 III
Arise and climbe our whitest highest hill
There your sad thoughts with joy and wonder fill
And see seas calme321 as earth earth as your will

 IV
Behold how lightning like a taper flyes
And guilds your charit but ashamed dyes
Seeing it selfe outgloried by your eyes

 V
Threatning and boystrous tempests gently bow
And to your steps part in soft paths when now
There no where hangs a cloud but on your brow

 VI
No showrs but twixt your lids nor gelid snow
But what your whiter chaster brest doth ow322
Whilst winds in chains colder for323 sorrow blow

 VII
Shrill trumpets doe only sound to eate
Artillery hath loaden evry dish with meate
And drums at evry health alarmes beate

 VIII
All things Lucasta but Lucasta call
Trees borrow tongues waters in accents fall
The aire doth sing and fire is324 musicall

 IX
Awake from the dead vault in which you dwell
Alls loyall here except your thoughts rebell
Which so let loose often their genrall quell

 X
See she obeys By all obeyed thus
No storms heats colds no soules contentious
Nor civill war is found I meane to us

 XI
Lovers and angels though in heavn they show
And see the woes and discords here below
What they not feele must not be said to know

321 Original has COLME

322 ie own

323 Original reads YOUR

324 Original has FIRES but FIRE IS is required by the metre

 AMARANTHA
 A PASTORALL331

 Up with the jolly bird of light
Who sounds his third retreat to night
Faire Amarantha from her bed
Ashamed starts and rises red
As the carnationmantled morne
Who now the blushing robe doth spurne
And puts on angry gray whilst she
The envy of a deity
Arayes her limbes too rich indeed
To be inshrind in such a weed
Yet lovely twas and strait but fit
Not made for her but she to it
By nature it sate close and free
As the just bark unto the tree
Unlike Loves martyrs of the towne
All day imprisond in a gown
Who rackt in silke stead of a dresse
Are cloathed in a frame or presse
And with that liberty and room
The dead expatiate in a tombe
 No cabinets with curious washes
Bladders and perfumed plashes
No venometemperd waters here
Mercury is banished this sphere
Her payles all this in which wet glasse
She both doth cleanse and view her face
 Far hence all Iberian smells
Hot amulets Pomander spells
Fragrant gales cool ayr the fresh
And naturall odour of her flesh
Proclaim her sweet from th wombe as morne
Those colourd things were made not borne
Which fixt within their narrow straits
Do looke like their own counterfeyts
So like the Provance rose she walkt
Flowerd with blush with verdure stalkt
Th officious wind her loose hayre curles
The dewe her happy linnen purles
But wets a tresse which instantly
Sol with a crisping beame doth dry
 Into the garden is she come
Love and delights Elisium
If ever earth showd all her store
View her discolourd budding floore
Here her glad eye she largely feedes
And stands mongst them as they mong weeds
The flowers in their best aray
As to their queen their tribute pay
And freely to her lap proscribe
A daughter out of evry tribe
Thus as she moves they all bequeath
At once the incense of their breath
 The noble Heliotropian
Now turnes to her and knowes no sun
 And as her glorious face doth vary
So opens loyall golden Mary332
Who if but glanced from her sight
Straight shuts again as it were night
The violet else lost ith heap
Doth spread fresh purple for each step
With whose humility possest
Sh inthrones the Poore Girle333 in her breast
The Julyflowr334 that hereto thrivd
Knowing her self no longerlivd
But for one look of her upheaves
Then stead of teares straight sheds her leaves
 Now the rich robed Tulip who
Clad all in tissue close doth woe
Her sweet to th eye but smelling sower
She gathers to adorn her bower
 But the proud Honysuckle spreads
Like a pavilion her heads
Contemnes the wanting commonalty
That but to two ends usefull be
And to her lips thus aptly plact
With smell and hue presents her tast
 So all their due obedience pay
Each thronging to be in her way
Faire Amarantha with her eye
Thanks those that live which else would dye
The rest in silken fetters bound
By crowning her are crown and crownd335
 And now the sun doth higher rise
Our Flora to the meadow hies
The poore distressed heifers low
And as sh approacheth gently bow
Begging her charitable leasure
To strip them of their milkie treasure
 Out of the yeomanry oth heard
With grave aspect and feet prepard
A revrend ladycow drawes neare
Bids Amarantha welcome here
And from her privy purse lets fall
A pearle or two which seemes to call
This adornd adored fayry
To the banquet of her dayry
 Soft Amarantha weeps to see
Mongst men such inhumanitie
That those who do receive in hay
And pay in silver336 twice a day
Should by their cruell barbrous theft
Be both of that and life bereft
 But tis decreed when ere this dies
That she shall fall a sacrifice
Unto the gods since those that trace
Her stemme show tis a godlike race
Descending in an even line
From heifers and from steeres divine
Making the honourd extract full
In Io and Europas bull
She was the largest goodliest beast
That ever mead or altar blest
Round was her udder and more white
Then is the Milkie Way in night
Her full broad eye did sparkle fire
Her breath was sweet as kind desire
And in her beauteous crescent shone
Bright as the argenthorned moone
 But see this whiteness is obscure
Cynthia spotted she impure
Her body writheld337 and her eyes
Departing lights at obsequies
Her lowing hot to the fresh gale
Her breath perfumes the field withall
To those two suns that ever shine
To those plump parts she doth inshrine
To th hovering snow of either hand
That love and cruelty command
 After the breakfast on her teat
She takes her leave oth mournfull neat
Who by her toucht now prizeth her338 life
Worthy alone the hollowed knife
 Into the neighbring wood shes gone
Whose roofe defies the telltale Sunne
And locks out evry prying beame
Close by the lips of a cleare streame
She sits and entertaines her eye
With the moist chrystall and the frye339
With burnishtsilver mald whose oares3310
Amazed still make to the shoares
What need she other bait or charm
What hook3311 or angle but her arm
The happy captive gladly tan
Sues ever to be slave in vaine
Who instantly confirmd ins feares
Hasts to his element of teares
 From hence her various windings roave
To a wellorderd stately grove
This is the pallace of the wood
And court oth Royall Oake where stood
The whole nobility the Pine
Strait Ash tall Firre and wanton Vine
The proper Cedar and the rest
Here she her deeper senses blest
Admires great Nature in this pile
Floord with greenevelvet Camomile
Garnisht with gems of unset fruit
Supplyd still with a self recruit
Her bosom wrought with pretty eyes
Of neverplanted Strawberries
Where th winged musick of the ayre
Do richly feast and for their fare
Each evening in a silent shade
Bestow a gratefull serenade
 Thus evn tyerd with delight
Sated in soul and appetite
Full of the purple Plumme and Peare
The golden Apple with the faire
Grape that mirth fain would have taught her
And nuts which squirrells cracking brought her
She softly layes her weary limbs
Whilst gentle slumber now beginnes
To draw the curtaines of her eye
When straight awakend with a crie
And bitter groan again reposes
Again a deep sigh interposes
And now she heares a trembling voyce
Ah can there ought on earth rejoyce
Why weares she this gay livery
Not black as her dark entrails be
Can trees be green and to the ayr
Thus prostitute their flowing hayr
Why do they sprout not witherd dy
Must each thing live save wretched I
Can dayes triumph in blew and red
When both their light and life is fled
Fly Joy on wings of Popinjayes
To courts of fools where3312 as your playes
Dye laught at and forgot whilst all
Thats good mourns at this funerall
Weep all ye Graces and you sweet
Quire that at the hill inspird meet
Love put thy tapers out that we
And th world may seem as blind as thee
And be since she is lost ah wound
Not Heavn it self by any found
 Now as a prisoner new cast3313
Who sleepes in chaines that night his last
Next morn is wakt with a repreeve
And from his trance not dream bid live
Wonders his sence not having scope
Who speaks his friend or his false hope
 So Amarantha heard but feare
Dares not yet trust her tempting care
And as againe her arms oth ground
Spread pillows for her head a sound
More dismall makes a swift divorce
And starts her thusRage rapine force
Ye blewflamd daughters oth abysse
Bring all your snakes here let them hisse
Let not a leaf its freshnesse keep
Blast all their roots and as you creepe
And leave behind your deadly slime
Poyson the budding branch ins prime
Wast the proud bowers of this grove
That fiends may dwell in it and move
As in their proper hell whilst she
Above laments this tragedy
Yet pities not our fate oh faire
Vowbreaker now betrothd to th ayr
Why by those lawes did we not die
As live but one Lucasta why
As he Lucasta namd a groan
Strangles the fainting passing tone
But as she heard Lucasta smiles
Posses3314 her round shes slipt mean whiles
Behind the blind of a thick bush
When each word tempring with a blush
She gently thus bespake Sad swaine
If mates in woe do ease our pain
Heres one full of that antick grief
Which stifled would for ever live
But told expires pray then reveale
To show our wound is half to heale
What mortall nymph or deity
Bewail you thus Who ere you be
The shepheard sight3315 my woes I crave
Smotherd in me me3316 in my grave
Yet be in show or truth a saint
Or fiend breath anthemes heare my plaint
For her and thy breaths symphony
Which now makes full the harmony
Above and to whose voice the spheres
Listen and call her musick theirs
This was I blest on earth with so
As Druids amorous did grow
Jealous of both for as one day
This star as yet but set in clay
By an imbracing river lay
They steept her in the hollowed brooke
Which from her humane nature tooke
And straight to heaven with winged feare3317
Thus ravisht with her ravish her
 The nymph replyd This holy rape
Became the gods whose obscure shape
They clothd with light whilst ill you grieve
Your better life should ever live
And weep that she to whom you wish
What heavn could give has all its blisse
Calling her angell here yet be
Sad at this true divinity
Shes for the altar not the skies
Whom first you crowne then sacrifice
 Fond man thus to a precipice
Aspires till at the top his eyes
Have lost the safety of the plain
Then begs of Fate the vales againe
 The now confounded shepheard cries
Ye allconfounding destines
How did you make that voice so sweet
Without that glorious form to it
Thou sacred spirit of my deare
Where ere thou hoverst ore us hear
Imbark thee in the lawrell tree
And a new Phebus follows thee
Who stead of all his burning rayes
Will strive to catch thee with his layes
Or if within the Orient Vine
Thou art both deity and wine
But if thou takest the mirtle grove
That Paphos is thou Queene of Love
And I thy swain who else must die
By no beasts but thy cruelty
But you are rougher than the winde
Are souls on earth then heavn3318 more kind
Imprisoned in mortality
Lucasta would have answered me
Lucasta Amarantha said
Is she that virginstar a maid
Except her prouder livery
In beauty poore and cheap as I
Whose glory like a meteor shone
Or aery apparition
Admird a while but slighted known
 Fierce as the chafed lyon hies
He rowses him and to her flies
Thinking to answer with his speare
 Now as in warre intestine where
Ith mist of a black battell each
Layes at his next then makes a breach
Through th entrayles of another whom
He sees nor knows whence he did come
Guided alone by rage and th drumme
But stripping and impatient wild
He finds too soon his onely child
 So our expiring desprate lover
Fard when amazd he did discover
Lucasta in this nymph his sinne
Darts the accursed javelin
Gainst his own breast which she puts by
With a soft lip and gentle eye
Then closes with him on the ground
And now her smiles have heald his wound
Alexis too again is found
But not untill those heavy crimes
She hath kisd off a thousand times
Who not contented with this pain
Doth threaten to offend again
 And now they gaze and sigh and weep
Whilst each cheek doth the others steep
Whilst tongues as exorcisd are calm
Onely the rhetrick of the palm
Prevailing pleads untill at last
Theyre chaind in one another fast
Lucasta to him doth relate
Her various chance and diffring fate
How chacd by Hydraphil and tract
The numrous foe to Philanact
Who whilst they for the same things fight
As Bards decrees and Druids rite
For safeguard of their proper joyes
And shepheards freedome each destroyes
The glory of this Sicilie
Since seeking thus the remedie
They fancy building on false ground
The means must them and it confound
Yet are resolved to stand or fall
And win a little or lose all
 From this sad storm of fire and blood
She fled to this yet living wood
Where she mongst savage beasts doth find
Her self more safe then humane3319 kind
 Then she relates how Caelia3320
The ladyhere strippes her array
And girdles her in homespunne bayes
Then makes her conversant in layes
Of birds and swaines more innocent
That kenne not guile nor courtship ment
 Now walks she to her bowr to dine
Under a shade of Eglantine
Upon a dish of Natures cheere
Which both grew drest and servd up there
That done she feasts her smell with poses
Pluckt from the damask cloath of Roses
Which there continually doth stay
And onely frost can take away
Then wagers which hath most content
Her eye eare hand her gust or sent
 Intranct Alexis sees and heares
As walking above all the spheres
Knows and adores this and is wilde3321
Untill with her he live thus milde3322
So that which to his thoughts he meant
For losse of her a punishment
His armes hung up and his sword broke
His ensignes folded he betook
Himself unto the humble crook
And for a full reward of all
She now doth him her shepheard call
And in a see of flowrs install
Then gives her faith immediately
Which he returns religiously
Both vowing in her peacefull cave
To make their bridallbed and grave
 But the true joy this pair conceivd
Each from the other first bereavd
And then found after such alarmes
Fastpiniond in each others armes

singularly corrupt I have found it necessary to amend it

332 The marigold

333 A flower so called

334 More commonly known as THE GILLIFLOWER

335 ie the lady gathers the flowers and binds them in her
hair with a silken fillet making of them a kind of chaplet
or crown

336 ie silvery or white milk

337 An uncommon word signifying WRINKLED Bishop Hall seems
to be with the exception of Lovelace almost the only writer who
used it Compare however the following passage

 Like to a WRITHELD Carion I have seen
 Instead of fifty write her down fifteen
 Wearing her bought complexion in a box
 And evry morn her closetface unlocks

3314 This word does not appear to have any very exact meaning
See Halliwells DICTIONARY OF ARCHAIC WORDS art POSSE and

 TO ELLINDA THAT LATELY I HAVE NOT WRITTEN

 I
If in me anger or disdaine
In you or both made me refraine
From th noble intercourse of verse
That only vertuous thoughts rehearse
 Then chaste Ellinda might you feare
 The sacred vowes that I did sweare

 II
But if alone some pious thought
Me to an inward sadnesse brought
Thinking to breath your soule too welle
My tongue was charmed with that spell
 And left it since there was no roome
 To voyce your worth enough strooke dumbe

 III
So then this silence doth reveal
No thought of negligence but zeal
For as in adoration
This is loves true devotion
 Children and fools the words repeat
 But anchrites pray in tears and sweat



 ELLINDAS GLOVE
 SONNET

 I
Thou snowy farme with thy five tenements341
 Tell thy white mistris here was one
 That calld to pay his dayly rents
But she agathering flowrs and hearts is gone
And thou left voyd to rude possession

 II
But grieve not pretty Ermin cabinet
 Thy alabaster lady will come home
 If not what tenant can there fit
The slender turnings of thy narrow roome
But must ejected be by his owne dombe342

 III
Then give me leave to leave my rent with thee
 Five kisses one unto a place
 For though the lutes too high for me
Yet servants knowing minikin343 nor base
Are still allowd to fiddle with the case

342 Doom

343 A description of musical pin attached to a lute It was
only brought into play by accomplished musicians In the address
of The Country Suiter to his Love printed in Cotgraves WITS

 Fair Wench I cannot court thy sprightly eyes
 With a baseviol placd betwixt my thighs
 I cannot lisp nor to a fiddle sing
 Nor run upon a highstrecht minikin

In Middletons FAMILIE OF LOVE 1608 Works by Dyce ii 127
there is the following passage

 GUDGEON Ay and to all that forswear marriage and can be
 content with other mens wives
 GERARDINE Of which consort you two are grounds one touches
 the bass and the other tickles the minikin



 BEING TREATED
 TO ELLINDA

 For cherries plenty and for corans
Enough for fifty were there more ons
For elles of beere351 flutes352 of canary
That well did wash downe pastiesMary353
For peason chickens sawces high
Pig and the widdowvensonpye354
With certaine promise to your brother
Of the virginity of another
Where it is thought I too may peepe in
With knuckles far as any deepe in355
For glasses heads hands bellies full
Of wine and loyne rightworshipfull356
Whether all of or more behinda
Thankes freest freshest faire Ellinda
Thankes for my visit not disdaining
Or at the least thankes for your feigning
For if your mercy doore were locktwell
I should be justly soundly knocktwell
Cause that in dogrell I did mutter
Not one rhime to you from damRotter357

 Next beg I to present my duty
To pregnant sister in prime beauty
Whom well I deeme ere few months elder
Will take out Hans from pretty Kelder
And to the sweetly fayre Mabella
A match that vies with Arabella
In each respect but the misfortune
Fortune Fate I thee importune

 Nor must I passe the lovely Alice
Whose health Id quaffe in golden chalice
But since that Fate hath made me neuter
I only can in beaker pewter
But whod forget or yet left unsung
The doughty acts of George the yongson
Who yesterday to save his sister
Had slaine the snake had he not mist her
But I shall leave him till a nag on
He gets to prosecute the dragon
And then with helpe of sun and taper
Fill with his deeds twelve reames of paper
That Amadis358 Sir Guy and Topaz
With his fleet neigher shall keep nopace
 But now to close all I must switchhard
 Your servant ever
 LOVELACE RICHARD

351 This expression has reference to the old practice
of drinking beer and wine out of very high glasses with
divisions marked on them A yard of ale is even now a well
understood term nor is the custom itself out of date since
in some parts of the country one is asked to take not a glass
but A YARD The ell was of course strictly speaking a larger
measure than a yard but it was often employed as a mere synonyme
or equivalent Thus in MAROCCUS EXTATICUS 1595 Bankes says
Measure Marocco nay nay they that take up commodities make no
difference for measure between a Flemish elle and an English yard

352 In the new edition of Nares 1859 this very passage is
quoted to illustrate the meaning of the word which is defined
rather vaguely to be A CASK Obviously the word signifies
something of the kind but the explanation does not at all satisfy
me I suspect that a flute OF CANARY was so called from the cask
having several ventholes in the same way that the French call a
lamprey FLEUTE DALEMAN from the fish having little holes in the
upper part of its body

353 Forsyth in his ANTIQUARYS PORTFOLIO 1825 mentions
certain gluttonfeasts which used formerly to be celebrated
periodically in honour of the Virgin perhaps the pasties used on
these occasions were thence christened PASTIESMARY

354 Venison pies or pasties were the most favourite dish in
this country in former times innumerable illustrations might be
furnished of the high esteem in which this description of viand
was held by our ancestors who regarded it as a thoroughly English
luxury The anonymous author of HORAE SUBSECIVAE 1620 p 38
this volume is supposed to have been written by Giles Brydges
Lord Chandos describes an affected Englishman who has been
travelling on the Continent as sweating at the sight of a pasty
of venison and as swearing that the only delicacies be
mushrooms or CAVIARE or snayles

 The fullcramd dishes made the table crack
 Gammons of bacon brawn and what was chief
 King in all feasts a tall Sir Loyne of BEEF
 Fat venison pasties smoaking tis no fable
 Swans in their broath came swimming to the table

 TO ELLINDA
 VPON HIS LATE RECOVERY
 A PARADOX

 I
How I grieve that I am well
 All my health was in my sicknes
Go then Destiny and tell
 Very death is in this quicknes

 II
Such a fate rules over me
 That I glory when I languish
And do blesse the remedy
 That doth feed not quench my anguish

 III
Twas a gentle warmth that ceasd
 In the vizard of a feavor
But I feare now I am easd
 All the flames since I must leave her

 IV
Joyes though witherd circled me
 When unto her voice inured
Like those who by harmony
 Only can be throughly cured

 V
Sweet sure was that malady
 Whilst the pleasant angel hoverd
Which ceasing they are all as I
 Angry that they are recoverd

 VI
And as men in hospitals
 That are maimd are lodgd and dined
But when once their danger fals
 Ah th are healed to be pined

 VII
Fainting so I might before
 Sometime have the leave to hand her
But lusty am beat out of dore
 And for Love compelld to wander



 TO CHLOE COURTING HER FOR HIS FRIEND

 I
Chloe behold againe I bowe
Againe possest againe I woe
 From my heat hath taken fire
 Damas noble youth and fries361
 Gazing with one of mine eyes
 Damas halfe of me expires
Chloe behold Our fates the same
Or make me cinders too or quench his flame

 II
Id not be King unlesse there sate
Lesse lords that shard with me in state
 Who by their cheaper coronets know
 What glories from my diadem flow
 Its use and rate362 values the gem
 Pearles in their shells have no esteem
And I being sun within thy sphere
Tis my chiefe beauty thinner lights shine there

 III
The Usrer heaps unto his store
By seeing others praise it more
 Who not for gaine or want doth covet
 But cause another loves doth love it
 Thus gluttons cloyd afresh invite
 Their gusts from some new appetite
And after cloth removd and meate
Fall too againe by seeing others eate

of BURN

 GRATIANA DAUNCING AND SINGING

 I
See with what constant motion
Even and glorious as the sunne
 Gratiana steeres that noble frame
Soft as her breast sweet as her voyce
That gave each winding law and poyze
 And swifter then the wings of Fame

 II
She beat the happy pavement
By such a starremade firmament
 Which now no more the roofe envies
But swells up high with Atlas evn
Bearing the brighter nobler Heavn
 And in her all the Dieties

 III
Each step trod out a lovers thought
And the ambitious hopes he brought
 Chaind to her brave feet with such arts
Such sweet command and gentle awe
As when she ceasd we sighing saw
 The floore lay pavd with broken hearts

 IV
So did she move so did she sing
Like the harmonious spheres that bring
 Unto their rounds their musicks ayd
Which she performed such a way
As all th inamourd world will say
 The Graces daunced and Apollo playd

 AN ELOGIE

 It was373 Amyntors Grove that Chloris
For ever ecchoes and her glories
Chloris the gentlest sheapherdesse
That ever lawnes and lambes did blesse
Her breath like to the whispering winde
Was calme as thought sweet as her minde
Her lips like coral gates kept in
The perfume and374 the pearle within
Her eyes a doubleflaming torch
That alwayes shine and never scorch
Her375 selfe the Heavn in which did meet
The all of bright of faire and sweet
 Here was I brought with that delight
That seperated soules take flight
And when my reason calld my sence
Back somewhat from this excellence
That I could see I did begin
T observe the curious ordering
Of every roome where ts hard to know
Which most excels in sent or show
Arabian gummes do breathe here forth
And th Easts come over to the North
The windes have brought their hyre376 of sweet
To see Amyntor Chloris greet
Balme and nard and each perfume
To blesse this payre377 chafe and consume
And th Phoenix see already fries
Her neast a fire in Chloris378 eyes
 Next379 the great and powerful hand
Beckens my thoughts unto a stand
Of Titian Raphael Georgone
Whose art even Nature hath outdone
For if weake Nature only can
Intend not perfect what is man
These certainely we must prefer
Who mended what she wrought and her
And sure the shadowes of those rare
And kind incomparable fayre
Are livelier nobler company
Then if they could or speake or see
For these3710 I aske without a tush
Can kisse or touch without a blush
And we are taught that substance is
If uninjoyd but th3711 shade of blisse
 Now every saint cleerly divine
Is closd so in her severall shrine
The gems so rarely richly set
For them wee love the cabinet
So intricately plact withall
As if th imbrordered the wall
So that the pictures seemd to be
But one continued tapistrie3712
 After this travell of mine eyes
We sate and pitied Dieties
Wee bound our loose hayre with the vine
The poppy and the eglantine
One swelld an oriental bowle
Full as a grateful loyal soule
To Chloris Chloris Heare oh heare
Tis pledgd above in evry sphere
 Now streight the Indians richest prize
Is kindled in3713 glad sacrifice
Cloudes are sent up on wings of thyme
Amber pomgranates jessemine
And through our earthen conduicts sore
Higher then altars fumd before
 So drencht we our oppressing cares
And choakt the wide jawes of our feares
Whilst ravisht thus we did devise
If this were not a Paradice
In all except these harmlesse sins
Behold flew in two cherubins
Cleare as the skye from whence they came
And brighter than the sacred flame
The boy adornd with modesty
Yet armed so with majesty
That if the Thunderer againe
His eagle sends she stoops in vaine3714
Besides his innocence he tooke
A sword and casket and did looke
Like Love in armes he wrote but five
Yet spake eighteene each grace did strive
And twenty Cupids thronged forth
Who first should shew his prettier worth
But oh the Nymph Did you ere know
Carnation mingled with snow3715
Or have you seene the lightning shrowd
And straight breake through th opposing cloud
So ran her blood such was its hue
So through her vayle her bright haire flew
And yet its glory did appeare
But thinne because her eyes were neere
 Blooming boy and blossoming mayd
May your faire sprigges be neere betrayd
To3716 eating worme or fouler storme
No serpent lurke to do them harme
No sharpe frost cut no Northwinde teare
The verdure of that fragrant hayre
But3717 may the sun and gentle weather
When you are both growne ripe together
Load you with fruit such as your Father
From you with all the joyes doth gather
And may you when one branch is dead
Graft such another in its stead
Lasting thus ever in your prime
Till th sithe is snatcht away from Time3718

372 ARIGO or ARRIGO is the Venetian form of HENRICO I have no
means of identifying CHLORIS or GRATIANA but AMYNTOR was probably
as I have already suggested Endymion Porter and ARIGO was
unquestionably no other than Henry Jermyn or Jarmin who though
no poet was like his friend Porter a liberal and discerning
patron of men of letters

Tooke for her winged wagge disguisd
But viewing then whereas she made
Not a distrest but lively shade
Of ECCHO whom he had betrayd
Now wanton and ith coole oth Sunne
With her delight a hunting gone
And thousands more whom he had slaine

Half in his armes halfe in the flood

Hangs no where now but on her neck

Gay as his youth now offering

See heere a powr above the slow
Weake execution of thy bow
 So said she rivd the wood in two
Unedged all his arrowes too

To that part whence we have our wound

Are bright Loysas pencills turnd

 A FORSAKEN LADY TO HER FALSE SERVANT
 THAT IS DISDAINED BY HIS NEW MISTRISS401

 Were it that you so shun me cause you wish
Cruelst a fellow in your wretchednesse
Or that you take some small ease in your owne
Torments to heare another sadly groane
I were most happy in my paines to be
So truely blest to be so curst by thee
But oh my cries to that doe rather adde
Of which too much already thou hast had
And thou art gladly sad to heare my moane
Yet sadly hearst me with derision

 Thou most unjust that really dust know
And feelst thyselfe the flames I burne in Oh
How can you beg to be set loose from that
Consuming stake you binde another at

 Uncharitablest both wayes to denie
That pity me for which yourself must dye
To love not her loves you yet know the pain
What tis to love and not be lovd againe

 Flye on flye on swift Racer untill she
Whom thou of all adorst shall learne of thee
The pace toutfly thee and shall teach thee groan
What terrour tis toutgo and be outgon

 Nor yet looke back nor yet must we
Run then like spoakes in wheeles eternally
And never overtake Be draggd on still
By the weake cordage of your untwind will
Round without hope of rest No I will turne
And with my goodnes boldly meete your scorne
My goodnesse which Heavn pardon and that fate
MADE YOU HATE LOVE AND FALL IN LOVE WITH HATE

 But I am changd Bright reason that did give
My soule a noble quicknes made me live
One breath yet longer and to will and see
Hath reacht me powr to scorne as well as thee
That thou which proudly tramplest on my grave
Thyselfe mightst fall conquerd my double slave
That thou mightst sinking in thy triumphs moan
And I triumph in my destruction

 Hayle holy cold chaste temper hayle the fire
Ravd402 ore my purer thoughts I feel t expire
And I am candied ice Yee powrs if ere
I shall be forct unto my sepulcher
Or violently hurld into my urne
Oh make me choose rather to freeze than burne

 TO MY NOBLE FRIEND MR CHARLES COTTON411
 ODE

Oh thou that swingst upon the waving eare412
 Of some wellfilled oaten beard413
Drunk evry night with a delicious teare414
 Dropt thee from Heavn where now thart reard

 II
The joyes of earth and ayre are thine intire
 That with thy feet and wings dost hop and flye
And when thy poppy workes thou dost retire
 To thy carvd acornbed to lye

 III
Up with the day the Sun thou welcomst then
 Sportst in the guilt plats415 of his beames
And all these merry dayes makst merry men416
 Thy selfe and melancholy streames

 IV
But ah the sickle golden eares are cropt

Sharpe frosty fingers all your flowrs have topt
 And what sithes spard winds shave off quite

 V
Poore verdant foole and now green ice thy joys
 Large and as lasting as thy peirch417 of grasse
Bid us lay in gainst winter raine and poize
 Their flouds with an oerflowing glasse

 VI
Thou best of men and friends we will create
 A genuine summer in each others breast
And spite of this cold Time and frosen Fate
 Thaw us a warme seate to our rest

 VII
Our sacred harthes shall burne eternally
 As vestal flames the Northwind he
Shall strike his froststretchd winges dissolve and flye
 This Aetna in epitome

 VIII
Dropping December shall come weeping in
 Bewayle th usurping of his raigne
But when in showrs of old Greeke418 we beginne
 Shall crie he hath his crowne againe

 IX
Night as cleare Hesper shall our tapers whip
 From the light casements where we play
And the darke hagge from her black mantle strip
 And sticke there everlasting day

 X
Thus richer then untempted kings are we
 That asking nothing nothing need
Though lord of all what seas imbrace yet he
 That wants himselfe is poore indeed

411 Charles Cotton the elder father of the poet He died
in 1658 This poem is extracted in CENSURA LITERARIA ix 352
as a favourable specimen of Lovelaces poetical genius The
text is manifestly corrupt but I have endeavoured to amend it
In Eltons SPECIMENS OF CLASSIC POETS 1814 i 148 is a
translation of Anacreons Address to the Cicada or TreeLocust
Lovelaces grasshopper which is superior to the modern poem
being less prolix and more natural in its manner In all
Lovelaces longer pieces there are too many obscure and feeble
conceits and too many evidences of a leaning to the metaphysical
and antithetical school of poetry

 AN ELEGIE
 ON THE DEATH OF MRS CASSANDRA COTTON
 ONLY SISTER TO MR C COTTON421

 Hither with hallowed steps as is the ground
That must enshrine this saint with lookes profound
And sad aspects as the dark vails you weare
Virgins opprest draw gently gently neare
Enter the dismall chancell of this rooome
Where each pale guest stands fixt a living tombe
With trembling hands helpe to remove this earth
To its last death and first victorious birth
Let gums and incense fume who are at strife
To enter th hearse and breath in it new life
Mingle your steppes with flowers as you goe
Which as they haste to fade will speake your woe

 And when y have plact your tapers on her urn
How poor a tribute tis to weep and mourn
That flood the channell of your eyelids fils
When you lose trifles or whats lesse your wills
If youl be worthy of these obsequies
Be blind unto the world and drop your eyes
Waste and consume burn downward as this fire
Thats fed no more so willingly expire
Passe through the cold and obscure narrow way
Then light your torches at the spring of day
There with her triumph in your victory
Such joy alone and such solemnity
Becomes this funerall of virginity

 Or if you faint to be so blest oh heare
If not to dye dare but to live like her
Dare to live virgins till the honourd age
Of thrice fifteen cals matrons on the stage
Whilst not a blemish or least staine is scene
On your white roabe twixt fifty and fifteene
But as it in your swathingbands was given
Bringt in your winding sheet unsoyld to Heavn
Daere to do purely without compact good
Or herald by no one understood
But him who now in thanks bows either knee
For th early benefit and secresie

 Dare to affect a serious holy sorrow
To which delights of pallaces are narrow
And lasting as their smiles dig you a roome
Where practise the probation of your tombe
With everbended knees and piercing prayr
Smooth the rough passe through craggy earth to ayr
Flame there as lights that shipwrackt mariners
May put in safely and secure their feares
Who adding to your joyes now owe you theirs

 Virgins if thus you dare but courage take
To follow her in life else through this lake
Of Nature wade and breake her earthly bars
Y are fixt with her upon a throne of stars
Arched with a pure Heavn chrystaline
Where round you love and joy for ever shine

 But you are dumbe as what you do lament
More senseles then her very monument
Which at your weaknes weeps Spare that vaine teare
Enough to burst the revrend sepulcher
Rise and walk home there groaning prostrate fall
And celebrate your owne sad funerall
For howsoere you move may heare or see
YOU ARE MORE DEAD AND BURIED THEN SHEE

Sing out pent soules sing cheerefully
Care shackles you in liberty
Mirth frees you in captivity
 Would you double fetters adde

Drink oth strong the rich the old

 Then if still your jollitie
 And throats are free

Tryumph in your bonds and paines
And daunce to the music of your chaines

 ON THE DEATH OF MRS ELIZABETH FILMER441
 AN ELEGIACALL EPITAPH

 You that shall live awhile before
Old time tyrs and is no more
When that this ambitious stone
Stoopes low as what it tramples on
Know that in that age when sinne
Gave the world law and governd Queene
A virgin livd that still put on
White thoughts though out of fashion
That tract the stars spite of report
And durst be good though chidden fort
Of such a soule that infant Heavn
Repented what it thus had givn
For finding equall happy man
Th impatient powrs snatch it agen
Thus chaste as th ayre whither shees fled
She making her celestiall bed
In her warme alablaster lay
As cold is in this house of clay
Nor were the rooms unfit to feast
Or circumscribe this angelguest
The radiant gemme was brightly set
In as divine a carkanet
Of442 which the clearer was not knowne
Her minde or her complexion
Such an everlasting grace
Such a beatifick face
Incloysters here this narrow floore
That possest all hearts before

 Blest and bewayld in death and birth
The smiles and teares of heavn and earth
Virgins at each step are afeard
Filmer is shot by which they steerd
Their star extinct their beauty dead
That the yong world to honour led
But see the rapid spheres stand still
And tune themselves unto her will

 Thus although this marble must
As all things crumble into dust
And though you finde this fairebuilt tombe
Ashes as what lyes in its wombe
Yet her saintlike name shall shine
A living glory to this shrine
And her eternall fame be read
When all but VERY VERTUES DEAD443

of East Sutton co Kent by his wife Eliza daughter of Richard

 TO MY WORTHY FRIEND MR PETER LILLY451
 ON THAT EXCELLENT PICTURE OF HIS MAJESTY AND THE DUKE OF YORKE
 DRAWNE BY HIM AT HAMPTONCOURT

 See what a clouded majesty and eyes
Whose glory through their mist doth brighter rise
 See what an humble bravery doth shine
And griefe triumphant breaking through each line
How it commands the face so sweet a scorne
Never did HAPPY MISERY adorne
So sacred a contempt that others show
To this oth height of all the wheele below
That mightiest monarchs by this shaded booke
May coppy out their proudest richest looke

 Whilst the true eaglet this quick luster spies
And by his SUNS enlightens his owne eyes
He cures452 his cares his burthen feeles then streight
Joyes that so lightly he can beare such weight
Whilst either eithers passion doth borrow
And both doe grieve the same victorious sorrow

 These my best LILLY with so bold a spirit
And soft a grace as if thou didst inherit
For that time all their greatnesse and didst draw
With those brave eyes your royal sitters saw

 Not as of old when a rough hand did speake
A strong aspect and a faire face a weake
When only a black beard cried villaine and
By hieroglyphicks we could understand
When chrystall typified in a white spot
And the bright ruby was but one red blot
Thou dost the things Orientally the same
Not only paintst its colour but its flame
Thou sorrow canst designe without a teare
And with the man his very hope or feare
So that th amazed world shall henceforth finde
None but my LILLY ever drew a MINDE

Lilly or Lilley by his contemporaries and Lilley is Pepys

picture of King Charles I holding a letter directed au roi
monseigneur and the Duke of York aet 14 presenting a penknife
to him to cut the strings It was drawn at Hampton Court when
the King was last there by Mr Lely who was earnestly recommended
to him I should have taken it for the hand of Fuller or Dobson
It is certainly very unlike Sir Peters latter manner and is
stronger than his former The King has none of the melancholy
grace which Vandyck alone of all his painters always gave him
It has a sterner countenance and expressive of the tempests he
had experiencedWalpoles ANECDOTES OF PAINTING IN ENGLAND

 THE LADY A L461
 MY ASYLUM IN A GREAT EXTREMITY

 With that delight the Royal captivs462 brought
Before the throne to breath his farewell thought
To tel his last tale and so end with it
Which gladly he esteemes a benefit
When the brave victor at his great soule dumbe
Findes something there fate cannot overcome
Cals the chaind prince and by his glory led
First reaches him his crowne and then his head
Who nere til now thinks himself slave and poor
For though nought else he had himselfe before
He weepes at this faire chance nor wil allow
But that the diadem doth brand his brow
And underrates himselfe below mankinde
Who first had lost his body now his minde

 With such a joy came I to heare my dombe
And haste the preparation of my tombe
When like good angels who have heavnly charge
To steere and guide mans sudden giddy barge
She snatcht me from the rock I was upon
And landed me at lifes pavillion
Where I thus wound out of th immense abysse
Was straight set on a pinacle of blisse

 Let me leape in againe and by that fall
Bring me to my first woe so cancel all
Ah s this a quitting of the debt you owe
To crush her and her goodnesse at one blowe
 Defend me from so foule impiety
Would make friends grieve and furies weep to see

 Now ye sage spirits which infuse in men
That are oblidgd twice to oblige agen
Informe my tongue in labour what to say
And in what coyne or language to repay
But you are silent as the evnings ayre
When windes unto their hollow grots repaire463
 Oh then accept the all that left me is
Devout oblations of a sacred wish

 When she walks forth ye perfumd wings oth East
Fan her til with the Sun she hastes to th West
And when her heavnly course calles up the day
And breakes as bright descend some glistering ray
To circle her and her as glistering haire
That all may say a living saint shines there
Slow Time with woollen feet make thy soft pace
And leave no tracks ith snow of her pure face
But when this vertue must needs fall to rise
The brightest constellation in the skies
When we in characters of fire shall reade
How cleere she was alive how spotless dead
All you that are a kinne to piety
For onely you can her close mourners be
Draw neer and make of hallowed teares a dearth
Goodnes and justice both are fled the earth

 If this be to be thankful Iv a heart
Broaken with vowes eaten with grateful smart
And beside this the vild464 world nothing hath
Worth anything but her provoked wrath
So then who thinkes to satisfie in time
Must give a satisfaction for that crime
Since she alone knowes the gifts value she
Can onely to her selfe requitall be
And worthyly to th life paynt her owne story
In its true colours and full native glory
Which when perhaps she shal be heard to tell
Buffoones and theeves ceasing to do ill
Shal blush into a virgininnocence
And then woo others from the same offence
The robber and the murderer in spite
Of his red spots shal startle into white
All good rewards layd by shal stil increase
For love of her and villany decease465
Naught466 be ignote not so much out of feare
Of being punisht as offending her

 So that when as my future daring bayes
Shall bow it selfe467 in lawrels to her praise
To crown her conquring goodnes and proclaime
The due renowne and glories of her name
My wit shal be so wretched and so poore
That stead of praysing I shal scandal her
And leave when with my purest art Iv done
Scarce the designe of what she is begunne
Yet men shal send me home admird exact
Proud that I could from her so wel detract

 Where then thou bold instinct shal I begin
My endlesse taske To thanke her were a sin
Great as not speake and not to speake a blame
Beyond whats worst such as doth want a name
So thou my all poore gratitude evn thou
In this wilt an unthankful office do
Or wilt I fling all at her feet I have
My life my love my very soule a slave
Tye my free spirit onely unto her
And yeeld up my affection prisoner
Fond thought in this thou teachest me to give
What first was hers since by her breath I live
And hast but showd me how I may resigne
Possession of those thing are none of mine

461 ie Anne Lady Lovelace the poets kinswoman who seems
to have assisted him in some emergency unknown to us except
through the present lines

462 Caractacus

463 The mythology of Greece assigned to each wind a separate
cave in which it was supposed to await the commands of its
sovereign Aeolus or Aeolos It is to this myth that Lovelace
alludes

464 A very common form of VILE among early writers

465 This reads like a parody on the fourth Eclogue of Virgil
The early English poets were rather partial to the introduction
of miniaturepictures of the Golden Age on similar occasions
to the present Thus Carew in his poem TO SAXHAM says

 The Pheasant Partridge and the Lark
 Flew to thy house as to the Ark
 The willing Oxe of himself came
 Home to the slaughter with the Lamb
 And every beast did thither bring
 Himself to be an offering

Wast not enough but thou must lead
 Bound too the Princesse of the aire

 Unhappy crawler on the land

 That her brave eyes do not command

 From her bright powr to shelter thee

 A PROLOGUE TO THE SCHOLARS
 A COMAEDY PRESENTED AT THE WHITE FRYERS471

 A gentleman to give us somewhat new
Hath brought up OXFORD with him to show you
Pray be not frightedTho the scaene and gowns
The Universities the wits the towns
The lines each honest Englishman may speake
Yet not mistake his mothertongue for Greeke
For stil twas part of his vowd liturgie
From learned comedies deliver me
Wishing all those that lovd em here asleepe
Promising SCHOLARS but no SCHOLARSHIP

 Youd smile to see how he dos vex and shake
Speakes naught but if the PROLOGUE dos but take
Or the first act were past the pikes once then
Then hopes and joys then frowns and fears agen
Then blushes like a virgin now to be
Robd of his comicall virginity
In presence of you all In short youd say
More hopes of mirth are in his looks then play

 These feares are for the noble and the wise
But if mongst you there are such fowle dead eyes
As can damne unaraignd cal law their powrs
Judging it sin enough that it is ours
And with the house shift their decreed desires
FAIRE still to th BLACKE BLACKE still to the WHITEFRYERS472
He dos protest he wil sit down and weep
Castles and pyramids   
      No he wil on
Proud to be raisd by such destruction
So far from quarrlling with himselfe and wit
That he wil thank them for the benefit
Since finding nothing worthy of their hate
They reach him that themselves must envy at

471 This was the theatre in Salisbury Court See Collier
H E D P iii 289 and Halliwells DICTIONARY OF OLD PLAYS
art SCHOLAR From the terms of the epilogue it seems to have
been a piece occupying two hours in the performance Judging
I presume from the opening lines Mr Halliwell supposes it
to have been originally acted at Gloucester Hall Probably
Mr Halliwell is right

472 A quibble on the two adjacent theatres in Whitefriars
and Blackfriars



 THE EPILOGUE

 The stubborne author of the trifle481 crime
That just now cheated you of two hours time
Presumptuous it likt him482 began to grow
Carelesse whether it pleased you or no

 But we who ground th excellence of a play
On what the women at the dores wil say
Who judge it by the benches and afford
To take your money ere his oath or word
His SCHOLLARS schoold sayd if he had been wise
He should have wove in one two COMEDIES
The first for th gallery in which the throne
To their amazement should descend alone
The rosinlightning flash and monster spire
Squibs and words hotter then his fire

 Th other for the gentlemen oth pit
Like to themselves all spirit fancy wit
In which plots should be subtile as a flame
Disguises would make PROTEUS stil the same
Humours so rarely humourd and exprest
That evn they should thinke em so not drest
Vices acted and applauded too times
Tickled and th actors acted not their crimes
So he might equally applause have gaind
Of th hardned sooty and the snowy hand483

 Where now one SO SO484 spatters tother no
Tis his first play twere solecisme tshould goe
The next t showd pritily but searcht within
It appeares bare and bald as is his chin
The townewit sentences A SCHOLARS PLAY
Pish I know not why but thave not the way485

 We whose gaine is all our pleasure evn these
Are bound by justice and religion to please
Which he whose pleasures all his gaine goes by
As slightly as they doe his comaedy

 Culls out the few the worthy at whose feet
He sacrifices both himselfe and it
His fancies first fruits profit he knowes none
Unles that of your approbation
Which if your thoughts at going out will pay
Heel not looke farther for a second day486

481 Perhaps TRIFLING was the word written by Lovelace
A VENIAL OFFENCE is meant

482 It would be difficult to point out a writer so unpardonably
slovenly in his style or phraseology as Lovelace By Presumptuous
it likt him we must of course understand Presumptuous that
he liked it himself or presumptuously selfsatisfied

483 ie the rough and dirty occupants of the gallery and
the fair spectators in the boxes

484 An exclamation of approval when an actor made a hit
The phrase seems to be somewhat akin to the Italian SI SI
a corruption of SIA SIA

485 ie they do not know how to act a play

486 This prologue and epilogue were clearly not attached
to the play when it was first performed by the fellowcollegians
of the poet at Gloucester Hall as an amateur attempt in the
dramatic line but were first added when The Scholars was
reproduced in London and the parts sustained by ordinary actors



 AGAINST THE LOVE OF GREAT ONES

 Vnhappy youth betrayd by Fate
To such a love491 hath sainted hate
And damned those celestiall bands492
Are onely knit with equal hands
The love of great ones is a love493
Gods are incapable to prove
For where there is a joy uneven
There never never can be Heavn
Tis such a love as is not sent
To fiends as yet for punishment
IXION willingly doth feele
The gyre of his eternal wheele
Nor would he now exchange his paine
For cloudes and goddesses againe

 Wouldst thou with tempests lye Then bow
To th rougher furrows of her brow
Or make a thunderbolt thy choyce
Then catch at her more fatal voyce
Or gender with the lightning trye
The subtler494 flashes of her eye
Poore SEMELE495 wel knew the same
Who496 both imbract her God and flame
And not alone in soule did burne
But in this love did ashes turne

 How il doth majesty injoy
The bow and gaity oth boy
As if the purpleroabe should sit
And sentence give ith chayr of wit

 Say everdying wretch to whom
Each answer is a certaine doom497
What is it that you would possesse
The Countes or the naked Besse498
Would you her gowne or title do
Her box or gem the499 thing or show
If you meane HER the very HER
Abstracted from her caracter
Unhappy boy you may as soone
With fawning wanton with the Moone
Or with an amorous complaint
Get prostitute your very saint
Not that we are not mortal or
Fly VENUS altars and4910 abhor
The selfesame knack for which you pine
But we defend us are divine
Not female but madam born4911 and come
From a righthonourable wombe
Shal we then mingle with the base
And bring a silvertinsell race
Whilst th issue noble wil not passe
The gold alloyd4912 almost halfe brasse
And th blood in each veine doth appeare
Part thick Booreinn part Lady Cleare
Like to the sordid insects sprung
From Father Sun and Mother Dung
Yet lose we not the hold we have
But faster graspe the trembling slave
Play at baloon withs heart and winde
The strings like scaines steale into his minde
Ten thousand false4913 and feigned joyes
Far worse then they whilst like whipt boys
After this scourge hees hush with toys

 This4914 heard Sir play stil in her eyes
And be a dying live4915 like flyes

 TO ALTHEA
 FROM PRISON
 SONG
 SET BY DR JOHN WILSON501

 I
When love with unconfined wings
 Hovers within my gates
And my divine ALTHEA brings
 To whisper at the grates
When I lye tangled in her haire502
 And fetterd to her eye503
The birds504 that wanton in the aire
 Know no such liberty

 II
When flowing cups run swiftly round
 With no allaying THAMES
Our carelesse heads with roses bound
 Our hearts with loyal flames
When thirsty griefe in wine we steepe
 When healths and draughts go free
Fishes that tipple in the deepe
 Know no such libertie

 III
When like committed linnets505 I
 With shriller throat shall sing
The sweetnes mercy majesty
 And glories of my King
When I shall voyce aloud how good
 He is how great should be
Inlarged winds that curle the flood
 Know no such liberty

 IV
Stone walls doe not a prison make
 Nor iron bars a cage
Mindes innocent and quiet take
 That for an hermitage
If I have freedome in my love
 And in my soule am free
Angels alone that sore above
 Enjoy such liberty

501 The first stanza of this famous song is harmonized in
CHEERFULL AYRES OR BALLADS FIRST COMPOSED FOR ONE SINGLE VOICE
AND SINCE SET FOR THREE VOICES By John Wilson Dr in Music
Professor of the same in the University of Oxford Oxford 1660
Sept 20 1659 4to p 10 I have sometimes thought that
when Lovelace composed this production he had in his recollection
some of the sentiments in Withers SHEPHERDS HUNTING 1615 See
more particularly the sonnet at p 248 of Mr Gutchs Bristol
edition commencing

 I that erst while the worlds sweet air did draw

502 Peele in KING DAVID AND FAIR BETHSABE 1599 has a similar
figure where David says

 Now comes my lover tripping like the roe
 And brings my longings tangled in her hair

The lover is of course Bethsabe

503 Thus Middleton in his MORE DISSEMBLERS BESIDES WOMEN
printed in 1657 but written before 1626 says

 But for modesty
 I should fall foul in words upon fond man
 That can forget his excellence and honour
 His serious meditations being the end
 Of his creation to learn well to die
 And live a PRISONER TO A WOMANS EYE

504 Original reads GODS the present word is substituted
in accordance with a MS copy of the song printed by the late
Dr Bliss in his edition of Woods ATHENAE If Dr Bliss had
been aware of the extraordinary corruptions under which the text
of LUCASTA laboured he would have had less hesitation in adopting
BIRDS as the true reading The Song to Althea is a favourable
specimen of the class of composition to which it belongs but
I fear that it has been overestimated

505 Percy very unnecessarily altered LIKE COMMITTED LINNETS
to LINNETLIKE CONFINED Percys RELIQUES ii 247 Moxons ed
Ellis SPECIMENS OF EARLY ENGLISH POETS ed 1801 iii 252
says that this latter reading is more intelligible It is not
however either what Lovelace wrote or what it may be presumed
he intended to write and nothing it would seem can be clearer
than the passage as it stands COMMITTED signifying in fact
nothing more than CONFINED It is fortunate for the lovers
of early English literature that Bp Percy had comparatively
little to do with it Emendation of a text is well enough
but the wholesale and arbitrary slaughter of it is quite another
matter

 SIR THOMAS WORTLEYS SONNET ANSWERED

 THE SONNET

 I
 No more
Thou little winged archer now no more
 As heretofore
Thou maist pretend within my breast to bide
 No more
Since cruell Death of dearest LYNDAMORE
 Hath me deprivd
I bid adieu to love and all the world beside

 II
 Go go
Lay by thy quiver and unbend thy bow
 Poore sillie foe
Thou spendst thy shafts but at my breast in vain
 Since Death
My heart hath with a fatall icie deart
 Already slain
Thou canst not ever hope to warme her wound
 Or wound it ore againe


 THE ANSWER

 I
 Againe
Thou witty cruell wanton now againe
 Through evry veine
Hurle all your lightning and strike evry dart
 Againe
Before I feele this pleasing pleasing paine
 I have no heart
Nor can I live but sweetly murderd with
 So deare so deare a smart

 II
 Then flye
And kindle all your torches at her eye
 To make me dye
Her martyr and put on my roabe of flame
 So I
Advanced on my blazing wings on high
 In death became
Inthroand a starre and ornament unto
 Her glorious glorious name

Heark faire one how what ere here is
 Doth laugh and sing at thy distresse
Not out of hate to thy reliefe
 But joy t enjoy thee though in griefe

 II
See that which chaynes you you chaine here
 The prison is thy prisoner
How much thy jaylors keeper art
 He bindes your hands but you his heart

 III
The gyves to rase so smooth a skin
 Are so unto themselves within
But blest to kisse so fayre an arme
 Haste to be happy with that harme

 IV
And play about thy wanton wrist
 As if in them thou so wert drest
But if too rough too hard they presse
 Oh they but closely closely kisse

 V
And as thy bare feet blesse the way
 The people doe not mock but pray
And call thee as amasd they run
 Instead of prostitute a nun

 VI
The merry torch burnes with desire
 To kindle the eternall fire
And lightly daunces in thine eyes
 To tunes of epithalamies

 VII
The sheets tyd ever to thy wast
 How thankfull to be so imbract
And see thy very very bonds
 Are bound to thee to binde such hands

A pearle for each wet bead Id pay

Too fruitfull of her selfe is anguish
We need no cherishing to languish

Like little children uses when
He whips us first untill we weepe
Then cause we still a weeping keepe

 IV
Then from thy firme selfe never swerve
Teares fat the griefe that they should sterve
Iron decrees of destinie
Are nere wipet out with a wet eye

But this way you may gaine the field
Oppose but sorrow and twill yield
One gallant thoroughmade resolve
Doth starry influence dissolve

 This is the prittiest motion
Madam th alarums of a drumme
That cals your lord set to your cries
To mine are sacred symphonies

 What though tis said I have a voice
I know tis but that hollow noise
Which as it through my pipe doth speed
Bitterns do carol through a reed
In the same key with monkeys jiggs
Or dirges of proscribed piggs
Or the soft Serenades above
In calme of night532 when533 cats make534 love

 Was ever such a consort seen
Fourscore and fourteen with forteen
Yet535 sooner theyl agree one paire
Then we in our springwinter aire
They may imbrace sigh kiss the rest
Our breath knows nought but east and west
Thus have I heard to childrens cries
The faire nurse still such lullabies
That well all sayd for what there lay
The pleasure did the sorrow pay

 Sure thers another way to save
Your phansie536 madam thats to have
Tis but a petitioning kinde fate
The organs sent to Bilingsgate
Where they to that soft murmring quire
Shall teach537 you all you can admire
Or do but heare how lovebang Kate
In pantry darke for freage of mate
With edge of steele the square wood shapes
And DIDO538 to it chaunts or scrapes
The merry Phaeton oth carre
Youl vow makes a melodious jarre
Sweeter and sweeter whisleth He
To unanointed539 axeltree
Such swift notes he and s wheels do run
For me I yeeld him Phaebus son
 Say faire Comandres can it be
You should ordaine a mutinie
For where I howle all accents fall
As kings harangues to one and all5310

 Ulisses art is now withstood5311
You ravish both with sweet and good
Saint Syren sing for I dare heare
But when I ope oh stop your eare

 Far lesse bet aemulation
To passe me or in trill or5312 tone
Like the thin throat of Philomel
And the5313 smart lute who should excell
As if her soft cords should begin
And strive for sweetnes with the pin5314

 Yet can I musick too but such
As is beyond all voice or5315 touch
My minde can in faire order chime
Whilst my true heart still beats the time
My soules so full of harmonie
That it with all parts can agree
If you winde up to the highest fret5316
It shall descend an eight from it
And when you shall vouchsafe to fall
Sixteene above you it shall call
And yet so disassenting one
They both shall meet in5317 unison

 Come then bright cherubin begin
My loudest musick is within
Take all notes with your skillfull eyes
Hearke if mine do not sympathise
Sound all my thoughts and see exprest
The tablature5318 of my large brest
Then youl admit that I too can
Musick above dead sounds of man
Such as alone doth blesse the spheres
Not to be reacht with humane eares

531 Madam A L is not in MS copy The Lady A L and
Madam A L may very probably be two different persons for
Carew in his Poems edit 1651 8vo p 2 has a piece To A L
Persuasions to Love and it is possible that the A L of Carew
and the A L mentioned above are identical The following poem
is printed in Durfeys PILLS TO PURGE MELANCHOLY v 120 but
whether it was written by Lovelace and addressed to the same lady
whom he represents above as requesting him to join her in a song
or whether it was the production of another pen I cannot at all
decide It is not particularly unlike the style of the author of
LUCASTA At all events I am not aware that it has been
appropriated by anybody else and as I am reluctant to omit any
piece which Lovelace is at all likely to have composed I give
these lines just as I find them in Durfey where they are set to
music

 TO HIS FAIREST VALENTINE MRS A L

 Come pretty birds present your lays
 And learn to chaunt a goddess praise
 Ye woodnymphs let your voices be
 Employd to serve her deity
 And warble forth ye virgins nine
 Some music to my Valentine

 Her bosom is loves paradise
 There is no heavn but in her eyes
 Shes chaster than the turtledove
 And fairer than the queen of love
 Yet all perfections do combine
 To beautifie my Valentine

 Shes Natures choicest cabinet
 Where honour beauty worth and wit
 Are all united in her breast
 The graces claim an interest
 All virtues that are most divine
 Shine clearest in my Valentine

538 This must refer I suppose to the ballad of Queen Dido
which the woman sings as she works The signification of LOVEBANG
is not easily determined BANG in Suffolk is a term applied
to a particular kind of cheese but I suspect that lovebang Kate
merely signifies noisy Kate here As to the old ballad of Dido
see Stafford Smiths MUSICA ANTIQUA i 10 ii 158 and Colliers
EXTRACTS FROM THE REGISTERS OF THE STATIONERS COMPANY i 98
I subjoin the first stanza of Dido as printed in the MUSICA
ANTIQUA

 Dido was the Carthage Queene
 And lovd the Troian knight
 That wandring many coasts had seene
 And many a dreadfull fight
 As they ahunting road a showr
 Drove them in a loving bower
 Down to a darksome cave
 Where Aenaeas with his charmes
 Lockt Queene Dido in his armes
 And had what he would have

 VALIANT LOVE

 I
Now fie upon that everlasting life I dye
 She hates Ah me It makes me mad
As if love fird his torch at a moist eye
 Or with his joyes ere crownd the sad
Oh let me live and shout when I fall on
 Let me evn triumph in the first attempt
 Loves duellist from conquest s not exempt
When his fair murdresse shall not gain one groan
And he expire evn in ovation

 II
Let me make my approach when I lye downe
 With counterwrought and travers eyes541
With peals of confidence batter the towne
 Had ever beggar yet the keyes
No I will vary stormes with sun and winde
 Be rough and offer calme condition
 March in and pread542 or starve the garrison
Let her make sallies hourely yet Ile find
Though all beat of shees to be undermind

 III
Then may it please your little excellence
 Of hearts t ordaine by sound of lips
That henceforth none in tears dare love comence
 Her thoughts ith full his in th eclipse
On paine of having s launce broke on her bed
 That he be branded all free beauties slave
 And his own hollow eyes be dombd his grave
Since in your hoast that coward nere was fed
Who to his prostrate ere was prostrated

541 This seems to be it phrase borrowed by the poet from
his military vocabulary He wishes to express that he had
fortified his eyes to resist the glances of his fair opponent

 TO MY LADY H
 ODE

 I
Tell me ye subtill judges in loves treasury
Inform me which hath most inricht mine eye
This diamonds greatnes or its clarity

 II
Ye cloudy spark lights whose vast multitude
Of fires are harder to be found then viewd
Waite on this star in her first magnitude

 III
Calmely or roughly Ah she shines too much
That now I lye her influence is such
Chrusht with too strong a hand or soft a touch

 IV
Lovers beware a certaine double harme
Waits your proud hopes her looks alkilling charm
Guarded by her as true victorious arme

 V
Thus with her eyes brave Tamyris spake dread
Which when the kings dull breast not entered
Finding she could not looke she strook him dead

551 This word though generally used in a bad sense by early
writers does not seem to bear in the present case any offensive
meaning The late editors of Nares quote a passage from one of
Cowleys ESSAYS in which that writer seems to imply by the term
merely a fine woman

TOC1 Since the note at p 133 ie note 551 was written
the following description by Aubrey LIVES c ii 332
of a picture of the Lady Venetia Digby has fallen under my notice
Also at Mr Roses a jeweller in Henrietta Street in Covent
Garden is an excellent piece of hers drawne after she was newly
dead She had a most lovely sweetturned face delicate darke
browne haire She had a perfect healthy constitution strong
good skin wellproportioned inclining to a BONAROBA

I cannot tell who loves the skeleton
Of a poor marmoset nought but boan boan
Give me a nakednesse with her cloaths on

 II
Such whose whitesattin upper coat of skin
Cut upon velvet rich incarnadin561
Has yet a body and of flesh within

 III
Sure it is meant good husbandry562 in men
Who do incorporate with aery leane

561 ie Carnation hue a species of red As an adjective
the word is peculiarly rare

562 Management or economy

563 ie Essay

564 A RASCAL DEER was formerly a wellknown term among
sportsmen signifying a lean beast not worth pursuit Thus
in A C MERY TALYS 1525 No 29 we findthey apoynted
thys Welchman to stand still and forbade him in any wyse
to shote at no rascal dere but to make sure of the greate male
and spare not In the new edition of Nares other and more recent
examples of the employment of the term are given But in the
BOOK OF SAINT ALBANS 1486 RASCAL is used in the signification
merely of a beast other than one of enchace

 And where that ye come in playne or in place
 I shall you tell whyche ben bestys of enchace
 One of them is the bucke a nother is the doo
 The foxe and the marteron and the wylde roo
 And ye shall my dere chylde other bestys all
 Where so ye theym finde Rascall ye shall them call

Carew has a similar sentiment

 Give me more Love or more Disdain

 Either extreme of Love or Hate
 Is sweeter than a calme estate
 Carews POEMS ed 1651 p 14

 A DIALOGUE BETWIXT CORDANUS AND AMORET ON A LOST HEART

Cord Distressed pilgrim whose dark clouded eyes
 Speak thee a martyr to loves cruelties
 Whither away
Amor What pitying voice I hear
 Calls back my flying steps
Cord Prythee draw near
Amor I shall but say kind swain what doth become
 Of a lost heart ere to Elysium
 It wounded walks
Cord First it does freely flye
 Into the pleasures of a lovers eye
 But once condemnd to scorn it fetterd lies
 An everbowing slave to tyrannies
Amor I pity its sad fate since its offence
 Was but for love Can591 tears recall it thence
Cord O no such tears as do for pity call
 She proudly scorns and glories at their fall
Amor Since neither sighs nor tears kind shepherd tell
 Will not a kiss prevail
Cord Thou mayst as well
 Court Eccho with a kiss
Amor Can no art move
 A sacred violence to make her love
Cord O no tis only Destiny or592 Fate
 Fashions our wills either to love or hate
Amor Then captive heart since that no humane spell
 Hath power to graspe thee his farewell
Cord593 Farewell

 May back return by chance but not594 by tears595

 AN ELEGIE
PRINCESSE KATHERINE601AN3 BORNE CHRISTENED BURIED
 IN ONE DAY

 You that can haply602 mixe your joyes with cries
And weave white Ios with black Elegies
Can caroll out a dirge and in one breath
Sing to the tune either of life or death
You that can weepe the gladnesse of the spheres
And pen a hymne in stead of inke with teares
Here here your unproportiond wit let fall
To celebrate this newborne funerall
And greete that little greatnesse which from th wombe
Dropt both a load to th cradle and the tombe

 Bright soule teach us to warble with what feet
Thy swathing linnen and thy winding sheet
Weepe603 or shout forth that fonts solemnitie
Which at once christnd and buried604 thee
And change our shriller passions with that sound
First told thee into th ayre then to605 the ground

 Ah wert thou borne for this only to call
The King and Queen guests to your buriall
To bid good night your day not yet begun
And shew606 a setting ere a rising sun

 Or wouldst thou have thy life a martyrdom
Dye in the act of thy religion
Fit excellently innocently good
First sealing it with water then thy blood
As when on blazing wings a blest man sores
And having past to God through fiery dores
Straight s roabd with flames when the same element
Which was his shame proves now his ornament
Oh how he hastned death burnt to be fryed607
Killd twice with each delay till deified
So swift hath been thy race so full of flight
Like him condemnd evn aged with a night
Cutting all lets with clouds as if th hadst been
Like angels plumd and borne a Cherubin

 Or in your journey towards heavn say
Tooke you the world a little in your way
Sawst and dislikst its vaine pompe then didst flye
Up for eternall glories to the skye
Like a religious ambitious one
Aspiredst for the everlasting crowne

 Ah holy traytour to your brother prince
Robd of his birthright and preheminence
Could you ascend yon chaire of state ere him
And snatch from th heire the starry diadem
Making your honours now as much uneven
As gods on earth are lesse then saints in heavn

 Triumph sing triumphs then Oh put on all
Your richest lookes drest for this festivall
Thoughts full of ravisht reverence with eyes
So fixt as when a saint we canonize
Clap wings with Seraphins before the throne
At this eternall coronation
And teach your soules new mirth such as may be
Worthy this birthday to divinity

 But ah these blast your feasts the jubilies
We send you up are sad as were our cries
And of true joy we can expresse no more
Thus crownd then when we buried thee before

 Princesse in heavn forgivenes whilst we
Resigne our office to the HIERARCHY

601 All historical and genealogical works are deficient
in minute information relative to the family of Charles I
Even in Andersons ROYAL GENEALOGIES 1732 and in the folio
editions of Rapin and Tindal these details are overlooked
At page 36 of his DESCENDANTS OF THE STUARTS 1858 Mr Townend
observes that two of the children of Charles I died in infancy
and of these the Princesse Katherine commemorated by Lovelace
was perhaps one The present verses were originally printed
in MUSARUM OXONIENSIUM CHARISTERIA Oxon 1638 4to from which
a few better readings have been obtained With the exceptions
mentioned in the notes the variations of the earlier text from
that found here are merely literal

AN3 P 140 PRINCESSE KATHERINE BORNE C IN ONE DAY
In Elliss ORIGINAL LETTERS Second Series iii 265 is printed
a scrap from Harl MS 6988 in the handwriting of the Princess
Elizabeth daughter of Charles I giving a list of the children
of that prince by Henrietta Maria with the dates of their birth
There mention is made of a Princess Katherine born Jan 29 1639
1639 is I believe a slip of the pen for 1637 that is to say
the princess was born on the 29th of January 16378 This
discrepancy between the CHARISTERIA and the memorandum in Harl MS
escaped Sir H Ellis who was possibly unaware of the existence of
the former For unless a mistake is assumed on the part of the
writer of the MS the existence of TWO Princesses Katherine must
be granted

602 This reading from CHARISTERIA 1638 seems preferable to
APTLY as it stands in the LUCASTA

603 So the CHARISTERIA The reading in LUCASTA is MOURNE

604 In LUCASTA the reading is BURIED AND CHRISTNED

605 This word is omitted in the LUCASTA it is here supplied
from the CHARISTERIA

606 LUCASTA reads SHOWES SHEW as printed in CHARISTERIA
is clearly the true word

607 ie freed FREE and FREED were sometimes formerly
pronounced like FRY and FRYED for Lord North in his
FOREST OF VARIETIES 1645 has these lines

 Birds that long have lived free
 Caught and cagd but pine and die

Here evidently FREE is intended to rhyme with DIE

Betwixt the Greekes and Latines whose
Temples should be bound with glory

to which Lovelace contributed the commendatory verses here
republished was executed by his friend Anthony Hodges AM

There had been already a translation by W Burton purporting
to be done from the Greek in 1597 4to The text of 1649 and
that of 1638 exhibit so many variations that the reader may be
glad to have the opportunity of comparison

612 There can be no doubt that Sidneys ARCADIA was formerly
as popular in its way among the readers of both sexes as Sir
Richard Bakers CHRONICLE appears to have been The former was
especially recommended to those who sought occasional relaxation
from severer studies See Higfords INSTITUTIONS 1658 8vo
p 467 In his poem of THE SURPRIZE Cotton describes his
nymph as reading the ARCADIA on the bank of a river

 The happy OBJECT of her eye
 Was SIDNEYS living ARCADY
 Whose amorous tale had so betraid
 Desire in this alllovely maid
 That whilst her check a blush did warm
 I read LOVES story in her form

614 The allusion is to the celebrated story of THEAGENES AND
CHARICLEA which was popular in this country at an early period
A drama on the subject was performed before Court in 1574

615 Lovelace refers it may be presumed to an edition
of ACHILLES TATIUS in which the Greek text was printed
with a Latin translation

 TO FLETCHER REVIVD631

 How have I bin religious what strange good
Has scapt me that I never understood
Have I helguarded Haeresie orthrowne
Heald wounded states made kings and kingdoms one
That FATE should be so merciful to me
To let me live t have said I have read thee

 Faire star ascend the joy the life the light
Of this tempestuous age this darke worlds sight
Oh from thy crowne of glory dart one flame
May strike a sacred reverence whilest thy name
Like holy flamens to their god of day
We bowing sing and whilst we praise we pray

 Bright spirit whose aeternal motion
Of wit like Time stil in it selfe did run
Binding all others in it and did give
Commission how far this or that shal live
Like DESTINY of poems who as she
Signes death to all her selfe cam never dye

 And now thy purplerobed Traegedy632
In her imbroiderd buskins cals mine eye
Where the brave Aetius we see betrayd
T obey his death whom thousand lives obeyd
Whilst that the mighty foole his scepter breakes
And through his genrals wounds his own doome speakes
Weaving thus richly VALENTINIAN
The costliest monarch with the cheapest man

 Souldiers may here to their old glories adde
The LOVER love and be with reason MAD633
Not as of old Alcides furious634
Who wilder then his bull did teare the house
Hurling his language with the canvas stone
Twas thought the monster rord the sobrer tone

 But ah when thou thy sorrow didst inspire
With passions blacke as is her darke attire
Virgins as sufferers have wept to see
So white a soule so red a crueltie
That thou hast grievd and with unthought redresse
Drid their wet eyes who now thy mercy blesse
Yet loth to lose thy watry jewell when
Joy wipt it off laughter straight sprungt agen

 Now ruddy checked Mirth with rosie wings635
Fans evry brow with gladnesse whilst she sings
Delight to all and the whole theatre
A festivall in heaven doth appeare
Nothing but pleasure love and like the morne
Each face a genral smiling doth adorne

 Heare ye foul speakers that pronounce the aire
Of stewes and shores636 I will informe you where
And how to cloath aright your wanton wit
Without her nasty bawd attending it637
View here a loose thought sayd with such a grace
Minerva might have spoke in Venus face
So well disguisd that twas conceivd by none
But Cupid had Dianas linnen on
And all his naked parts so vaild th expresse
The shape with clowding the uncomlinesse
That if this Reformation which we
Receivd had not been buried with thee
The stage as this worke might have livd and lovd
Her lines the austere Skarlet638 had approvd
And th actors wisely been from that offence
As cleare as they are now from audience639

 Thus with thy Genius did the scaene expire6310
Wanting thy active and correcting fire
That now to spread a darknesse over all
Nothing remaines but Poesie to fall
And though from these thy Embers we receive

That we dare praise thee blushlesse in the head

And feast each other with remembring it
That we dare speak thy thought thy acts recite
Yet all men henceforth be afraid to write

had no doubt some tincture of Greek scholarship See Woods ATH

 THE DEDICATION

 TO THE RIGHT H0N0RABLE JOHN LOVELACE ESQUIRE641

SIR

LUCASTA fair but hapless maid
Once flourisht underneath the shade
Of your illustrious Mother now
An orphan grown she bows to you
To you her vertues noble heir
Oh may she find protection there
Nor let her welcome be the less
Cause a rough hand makes her address
One to whom foes the Muses are
Born and bred up in rugged war
For conscious how unfit I am
I only have pronouncd her name
To waken pity in your brest
And leave her tears to plead the rest
 Sir
 Your most obedient
 Servant and kinsman

 DUDLEY POSTHUMUSLOVELACE


641 This gentleman was the eldest son of John second Lord
Lovelace of Hurley co Berks by Anne daughter of Thomas
Earl of Cleveland The first part of LUCASTA was inscribed
by the poet himself to Lady Lovelace his mother



 POEMS



 TO LVCASTA

 HER RESERVED LOOKS

LUCASTA frown and let me die
 But smile and see I live
The sad indifference of your eye
 Both kills and doth reprieve
You hide our fate within its screen
 We feel our judgment ere we hear
So in one picture I have seen
 An angel here the devil there



 LUCASTA LAUGHING

Heark how she laughs aloud
Although the world put on its shrowd
Wept at by the fantastic crowd
 Who cry one drop let fall
From her might save the universal ball
 She laughs again
 At our ridiculous pain
 And at our merry misery
 She laughs until she cry
 Sages forbear
 That illcontrived tear
 Although your fear
Doth barricado hope from your soft ear
That which still makes her mirth to flow
 Is our sinisterhanded woe
Which downwards on its head doth go
 And ere that it is sown doth grow
 This makes her spleen contract
 And her just pleasure feast
 For the unjustest act
 Is still the pleasantst jest



 NIGHT

 TO LUCASTA

Night loathed jaylor of the lockd up sun
 And tyrantturnkey on committed day
Bright eyes lye fettered in thy dungeon
 And Heaven it self doth thy dark wards obey
 Thou dost arise our living hell
 With thee grones terrors furies dwell
 Until LUCASTA doth awake
And with her beams these heavy chaines off shake

Behold with opening her almighty lid
Bright eyes break rowling and with lustre spread
 And captive day his chariot mounted is
 Night to her proper hell is beat
 And screwed to her ebon seat
Till th Earth with play oppressed lies
And drawes again the curtains of her eyes

But bondslave I know neither day nor night
 Whether she murthring sleep or saving wake
Now broyld ith zone of her reflected light
 Then frose my isicles not sinews shake
 Smile then new Nature your soft blast
 Doth melt our ice and fires waste
Whilst the scorchd shivring world new born
Now feels it all the day one rising morn



 LOVE INTHROND

 ODE

 I
Introth I do my self perswade
 That the wilde boy is grown a man
And all his childishnesse off laid
 Ere since LUCASTA did his fires fan
 H has left his apish jigs
 And whipping hearts like gigs
 For t other day I heard him swear
That beauty should be crownd in honours chair

 II
With what a true and heavenly state
 He doth his glorious darts dispence
Now cleansd from falsehood blood and hate
 And newly tipt with innocence
 Love Justice is become
 And doth the cruel doome
 Reversed is the old decree
Behold he sits inthrond with majestie

 III
Inthroned in LUCASTAS eye
 He doth our faith and hearts survey
Then measures them by sympathy
 And each to th others breast convey
 Whilst to his altars now
 The frozen vestals bow
 And strickt Diana too doth go
Ahunting with his feard exchanged bow

 IV
Th imbracing seas and ambient air
 Now in his holy fires burn
Fish couple birds and beasts in pair
 Do their own sacrifices turn
 This is a miracle
 That might religion swell
 But she that these and their god awes
Her crowned self submits to her own laws



 HER MUFFE

 I
Twas not for some calm blessing to deceive
Thou didst thy polishd hands in shaggd furs weave
 It were no blessing thus obtaind
 Thou rather wouldst a curse have gaind
Then let thy warm driven snow be ever staind

 II
Not that you feared the discoloring cold
Might alchymize their silver into gold
 Nor could your ten white nuns so sin
 That you should thus pennance them in
Each in her coarse hair smock of discipline

 III
Nor Herolike who on their crest still wore
A lyon panther leopard or a bore
 To looke their enemies in their herse
 Thou wouldst thy hand should deeper pierce
And in its softness rough appear more fierce

 IV
No no LUCASTA destiny decreed
That beasts to thee a sacrifice should bleed
 And strip themselves to make you gay
 For ner yet herald did display
A coat where SABLES upon ERMIN lay

 V
This for laylovers that must stand at dore
Salute the threshold and admire no more
 But I in my invention tough
 Rate not this outward bliss enough
But still contemplate must the hidden muffe



 A BLACK PATCH651 ON LUCASTAS FACE

Dull as I was to think that a court fly
 Presumd so neer her eye
 When twas th industrious bee
 Mistook her glorious face for paradise
To summe up all his chymistry of spice
 With a brave pride and honour led
 Neer both her suns he makes his bed
And though a spark struggles to rise as red
 Then aemulates the gay
 Daughter of day
 Acts the romantick phoenix fate
 When now with all his sweets layd out in state
 LUCASTA scatters but one heat
And all the aromatick pills do sweat
And gums calcind themselves to powder beat
 Which a fresh gale of air
 Conveys into her hair
 Then chaft hes set on fire
And in these holy flames doth glad expire
 And that black marble tablet there
 So neer her either sphere
 Was placd nor foyl nor ornament
But the sweet little bees large monument

651 The following is a poets lecture to the ladies of his
time on the long prevailing practice of wearing patches
in which it seems that Lucasta acquiesced

 BLACK PATCHES
 VANITAS VANITATUM
 LADIES turn conjurers and can impart
 The hidden mystery of the black art
 Black artificial patches do betray
 They more affect the works of night than day
 The creature strives the Creator to disgrace
 By patching that which is a perfect face
 A little stain upon the purest dye
 Is both offensive to the heart and eye
 Defile not then with spots that face of snow
 Where the wise God His workmanship doth show
 The light of nature and the light of grace
 Is the complexion for a ladys face
 FLAMMA SINE FUMO by R Watkyns 1662 p 81

In a poem entitled THE BURSSE OF REFORMATION in praise of
the New Exchange printed in WIT RESTORED 1658 patches are
enumerated among the wares of all sorts to be procured there

 Heer patches are of every cut
 For pimples and for scars

They were also used for rheum as appears from a passage in
WESTWARD HOE 1607

 JUDITH I am so troubled with the rheum too Mouse whats
 good for it
 HONEY How often I have told you you must get a patch

Durfeys PILLS TO PURGE MELANCHOLY v 197

Mrs Pepys wore patches and so did my Lady Sandwich and her
daughterDIARY 30 Aug and 20 Oct 1660



 ANOTHER

 I
As I beheld a winters evening air
Curld in her courtfalselocks of living hair
Butterd with jessamine the sun left there

 II
Galliard and clinquant she appeard to give
A serenade or ball to us that grieve
And teach us A LA MODE more gently live

 III
But as a Moor who to her cheeks prefers
White spots t allure her black idolaters
Me thought she lookd all orebepatchd with stars

 IV
Like the dark front of some Ethiopian queen
Vailed all ore with gems of red blew green
Whose ugly night seemd masked with days skreen

 V
Whilst the fond people offerd sacrifice
To saphyrs stead of veins and arteries
And bowd unto the diamonds not her eyes

 VI
Behold LUCASTAS face howt glows like noon
A sun intire is her complexion
And formd of one whole constellation

 VII
So gently shining so serene so cleer
Her look doth universal Nature cheer
Only a cloud or two hangs here and there



 TO LUCASTA

 I
 I laugh and sing but cannot tell
 Whether the folly ont sounds well
 But then I groan
 Methinks in tune
Whilst grief despair and fear dance to the air
 Of my despised prayer

 II
 A pretty antick love does this
 Then strikes a galliard with a kiss
 As in the end
 The chords they rend
So you but with a touch from your fair hand
 Turn all to saraband



 TO LUCASTA

 I
Like to the sentnel stars I watch all night
 For still the grand round of your light
 And glorious breast
 Awake661 in me an east
Nor will my rolling eyes ere know a west

 II
Now on my down Im tossd as on a wave
 And my repose is made my grave
 Fluttering I lye
 Do beat my self and dye
But for a resurrection from your eye

 III
Ah my fair murdresse dost thou cruelly heal
 With various pains to make me well
 Then let me be
 Thy cut anatomie
And in each mangled part my heart youl see

 LUCASTA AT THE BATH

 I
I th autumn of a summers day
When all the winds got leave to play
LUCASTA that fair ship is lanchd
And from its crust this almond blanchd

 II
Blow then unruly northwind blow
Till in their holds your eyes you stow
And swell your cheeks bequeath chill death
See she hath smild thee out of breath

 III
Court gentle zephyr court and fan
Her softer breasts carnation wan
Your charming rhethorick of down
Flyes scatterd from before her frown

 IV
Say my white waterlilly say
How ist those warm streams break away
Cut by thy chast cold breast which dwells
Amidst them armd in isicles

 V
And the hot floods more raging grown
In flames of thee then in their own
In their distempers wildly glow
And kisse thy pillar of fixd snow

 VI
No sulphur through whose each blew vein
The thick and lazy currents strein
Can cure the smarting nor the fell
Blisters of love wherewith they swell

 VII
These great physicians of the blind
The lame and fatal blains of Inde
In every drop themselves now see
Speckled with a new leprosie

 VIII
As sick drinks are with old wine dashd
Foul waters too with spirits washd
Thou greivd perchance one tear letst fall
Which straight did purifie them all

 IX
And now is cleansd enough the flood
Which since runs cleare as doth thy blood
Of the wet pearls uncrown thy hair
And mantle thee with ermin air

 X
Lucasta hail fair conqueresse
Of fire air earth and seas
Thou whom all kneel to yet even thou
Wilt unto love thy captive bow



 THE ANT671

 I
Forbear thou great good husband little ant
 A little respite from thy flood of sweat
Thou thine own horse and cart under this plant
 Thy spacious tent fan thy prodigious heat
Down with thy double load of that one grain
It is a granarie for all thy train

 II
Cease large example of wise thrift awhile
 For thy example is become our law
And teach thy frowns a seasonable smile
 So Cato sometimes the nakd Florals saw672
And thou almighty foe lay by thy sting
Whilst thy unpayd musicians crickets sing

 III
LUCASTA she that holy makes the day
 And stills new life in fields of fueillemort673
Hath back restord their verdure with one ray
 And with her eye bid all to play and sport
Ant to work still age will thee truant call
And to save now thart worse than prodigal

 IV
Austere and cynick not one hour t allow
 To lose with pleasure what thou gotst with pain
But drive on sacred festivals thy plow
 Tearing highways with thy orecharged wain
Not all thy lifetime one poor minute live
And thy orelabourd bulk with mirth relieve

 V
Look up then miserable ant and spie
 Thy fatal foes for breaking of their674 law
Hovring above thee Madam MARGARET PIE
 And her fierce servant meagre Sir JOHN DAW
Thy self and storehouse now they do store up
And thy whole harvest too within their crop

 VI
Thus we unthrifty thrive within earths tomb
 For some more ravnous and ambitious jaw
The grain in th ants the ant675 in the pies womb
 The pie in th hawks the hawk676 ith eagles maw
So scattering to hord gainst a long day
Thinking to save all we cast all away

671 A writer in CENSURA LITERARIA x 292 first editthe
late E V Utterson Esqhighly praises this little poem and
says that it is not unworthy of Cowper I think it highly
probable that the translation from Martial lib vi Ep 15
at the end of the present volume was executed prior to the
composition of these lines and that the latter were suggested
by the former Compare the beautiful description of the ant in
the PROVERBS OF SOLOMONGo to the ant thou sluggard consider
her ways and be wise which having no guide overseer or ruler
provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the
harvestPROVERBS vi 68

In the poems of John Cleveland 1669 is a piece entitled
Fuscara or the Bee Errant which is of a somewhat similar
character and is by no means a contemptible production though
spoiled by that LUES ALCHYMISTICA which disfigures so much of the
poetry of Clevelands time The abilities of Cleveland as a
writer seem to have been underrated by posterity in proportion
to the undue praise lavished upon him by his contemporaries

 SONG

 I
 Strive not vain lover to be fine
 Thy silks the silkworms and not thine
You lessen to a fly your mistriss thought
To think it may be in a cobweb caught
 What though her thin transparent lawn
 Thy heart in a strong net hath drawn
Not all the arms the god of fire ere made
Can the soft bulwarks of nakd love invade

 II
 Be truly fine then and yourself dress
 In her fair souls immaclate glass
Then by reflection you may have the bliss
Perhaps to see what a true fineness is
 When all your gawderies will fit
 Those only that are poor in wit
She that a clinquant outside doth adore
Dotes on a gilded statue and no more

 THE FALCON

 Fair Princesse of the spacious air
That hast vouchsafd acquaintance here
With us are quarterd below stairs
That can reach heavn with nought but prayrs
Who when our activst wings we try
Advance a foot into the sky

 Bright heir t th bird imperial
From whose avenging penons fall
Thunder and lightning twisted spun
Brave cousingerman to the Sun
That didst forsake thy throne and sphere
To be an humble prisner here
And for a pirch of her soft hand
Resign the royal woods command

 How often wouldst thou shoot heavns ark
Then mount thy self into a lark
And after our short faint eyes call
When now a fly now nought at all
Then stoop so swift unto our sence
As thou wert sent intelligence

 Free beauteous slave thy happy feet
In silver fetters vervails701 meet
And trample on that noble wrist
The gods have kneeld in vain t have kist
But gaze not bold deceived spye
Too much oth lustre of her eye
The Sun thou dost out stare alas
Winks at the glory of her face

 Be safe then in thy velvet helm
Her looks are calms that do orewhelm
Then the Arabian bird more blest
Chafe in the spicery of her breast
And loose you in her breath a wind
Sowrs the delicious gales of Inde

 But now a quill from thine own wing
I pluck thy lofty fate to sing
Whilst we behold the varions fight
With mingled pleasure and affright
The humbler hinds do fall to prayr
As when an armys seen i th air
And the prophetick spannels run
And howle thy epicedium

 The heron mounted doth appear
On his own Pegsus a lanceer
And seems on earth when he doth hut
A proper halberdier on foot
Secure i th moore about to sup
The dogs have beat his quarters up

 And now he takes the open air
Drawes up his wings with tactick care
Whilst th expert falcon swift doth climbe
In subtle mazes serpentine
And to advantage closely twind
She gets the upper sky and wind
Where she dissembles to invade
And lies a poltick ambuscade

 The hedgdin heron whom the foe
Awaits above and dogs below
In his fortification lies
And makes him ready for surprize
When roused with a shrill alarm
Was shouted from beneath they arm

 The falcon charges at first view
With her brigade of talons through
Whose shoots the wary heron beat
With a well counterwheeld retreat
But the bold genral never lost
Hath won again her airy post
Who wild in this affront now fryes
Then gives a volley of her eyes

 The desprate heron now contracts
In one design all former facts
Noble he is resolvd to fall
His and his enmies funerall
And to be rid of her to dy
A publick martyr of the sky

 When now he turns his last to wreak
The palizadoes of his beak
The raging foe impatient
Wrackd with revenge and fury rent
Swift as the thunderbolt he strikes
Too sure upon the stand of pikes
There she his naked breast doth hit
And on the case of rapierss split

 But evn in her expiring pangs
The herons pouncd within her phangs
And so above she stoops to rise
A trophee and a sacrifice
Whilst her own bells in the sad fall
Ring out the double funerall

 Ah victory unhaply wonne
Weeping and red is set the Sun
Whilst the whole field floats in one tear
And all the air doth mourning wear
Closehooded all thy kindred come
To pay their vows upon thy tombe
The hobby702 and the musket703 too
Do march to take their last adieu

 The lanner704 and the lanneret705
Thy colours bear as banneret
The GOSHAWK and her TERCEL706 rowsd
With tears attend thee as new bowsd
All these are in their dark array
Led by the various heraldjay

 But thy eternal name shall live
Whilst quills from ashes fame reprieve
Whilst open stands renowns wide dore
And wings are left on which to soar
Doctor robbin the prelate pye
And the poetick swan shall dye
Only to sing thy elegie

 LOVE MADE IN THE FIRST AGE

 TO CHLORIS

 I
In the nativity of time
Chloris it was not thought a crime
 In direct Hebrew for to woe
Now wee make love as all on fire
Ring retrograde our lowd desire
 And court in English backward too

 II
Thrice happy was that golden age
When complement was construd rage
 And fine words in the center hid
When cursed NO staind no maids blisse
And all discourse was summd in YES
 And nought forbad but to forbid

 III711
Love then unstinted love did sip
And cherries pluckd fresh from the lip
 On cheeks and roses free he fed
Lasses like Autumne plums did drop
And lads indifferently did drop
 A flower and a maidenhead

 IV
Then unconfined each did tipple
Wine from the bunch milk from the nipple
 Paps tractable as udders were
Then equally the wholsome jellies
Were squeezd from olivetrees and bellies
 Nor suits of trespasse did they fear

 V
A fragrant bank of strawberries
Diaperd with violets eyes
 Was table tablecloth and fare
No palace to the clouds did swell
Each humble princesse then did dwell
 In the Piazza of her hair

 VI
Both broken faith and th cause of it
Alldamning gold was damnd to th pit
 Their troth seald with a clasp and kisse
Lasted until that extreem day
In which they smild their souls away
 And in each other breathd new blisse

 VII
Because no fault there was no tear
No grone did grate the granting ear
 No false foul breath their delcat smell
No serpent kiss poysond the tast
Each touch was naturally chast
 And their mere Sense a Miracle

 VIII
Naked as their own innocence
And unembroyderd from offence
 They went above poor riches gay
On softer than the cignets down
In beds they tumbled off their own
 For each within the other lay

 IX
Thus did they live thus did they love
Repeating only joyes above
 And angels were but with cloaths on
Which they would put off cheerfully
To bathe them in the Galaxie
 Then gird them with the heavenly zone

 X
Now Chloris miserably crave
The offerd blisse you would not have
 Which evermore I must deny
Whilst ravishd with these noble dreams
And crowned with mine own soft beams
 Injoying of my self I lye

TO A LADY WITH CHILD THAT ASKD AN OLD SHIRT721AN4

 And why an honourd ragged shirt that shows
Like tatterd ensigns all its bodies blows
Should it be swathed in a vest so dire
It were enough to set the child on fire
Dishevelld queens should strip them of their hair
And in it mantle the new rising heir
Nor do I know ought worth to wrap it in
Except my parchment uppercoat of skin
And then expect no end of its chast tears
That first was rowld in down now furs of bears

 But since to ladies t hath a custome been
Linnen to send that travail and lye in
To the nine sempstresses my former friends
I sud but they had nought but shreds and ends
At last the jollist of the three times three
Rent th apron from her smock and gave it me
Twas soft and gentle subtly spun no doubt
Pardon my boldnese madam HERES THE CLOUT

721 A portion of this little poem is quoted in Brands
POPULAR ANTIQUITIES edit 1849 ii 70 as an illustration
of the custom to which it refers No second example of such
an usage seems to have been known to Brand and his editors

AN4 P 183 TO A LADY WITH CHILDE THAT ASKT AN OLD SHIRT
The custom to which the Poet here refers was no doubt common
in his time although the indefatigable Brand does not appear
to have met with any illustration of it except in LUCASTA
But since the note at p 183 ie note 721 was written the
following passage in the old morality of THE MARRIAGE OF WIT
AND WISDOM circa 1570 has come under my notice

 INDULGENCE to her son WIT
 Well yet before the goest hold heare
 MY BLESSING IN A CLOUTE
 WELL FARE THE MOTHER AT A NEEDE
 Stand to thy tackling stout

The allusion is to the contemplated marriage of WIT to his
betrothed WISDOM



 SONG

 I
In mine one monument I lye
 And in my self am buried
Sure the quick lightning of her eye
 Melted my soul ith scabberd dead
And now like some pale ghost I walk
And with anothers spirit talk

 II
Nor can her beams a heat convey
 That may my frozen bosome warm
Unless her smiles have powr as they
 That a cross charm can countercharm
But this is such a pleasing pain
Im loth to be alive again



 ANOTHER

I did believe I was in heavn
When first the heavn her self was givn
That in my heart her beams did passe
As some the sun keep in a glasse
So that her beauties thorow me
Did hurt my rivalenemy
But fate alas decreed it so
That I was engine to my woe
For as a cornerd christal spot
My heart diaphanous was not
But solid stuffe where her eye flings
Quick fire upon the catching strings
Yet as at triumphs in the night
You see the Princes Arms in light
So when I once was set on flame
I burnt all ore the letters of her name



 ODE

 I
You are deceivd I sooner may dull fair
Seat a dark Moor in Cassiopeas731 chair
 Or on the glowworms uselesse light
 Bestow the watching flames of night
 Or give the roses breath
 To executed death
 Ere the bright hiew
 Of verse to you
It is just Heaven on beauty stamps a fame
And we alas its triumphs but proclaim

 II
What chains but are too light for me should I
Say that Lucasta in strange arms could lie
 Or that Castara732 were impure
 Or Saccarisas733 faith unsure
 That Chloris love as hair
 Embracd each enmies air
 That all their good
 Ran in their blood
Tis the same wrong th unworthy to inthrone
As from her proper sphere t have vertue thrown

 III
That strange force on the ignoble hath renown
As AURUM FULMINANS it blows vice down
 Twere better heavy one to crawl
 Forgot then raised trod on to fall
 All your defections now
 Are not writ on your brow
 Odes to faults give
 A shame must live
When a fat mist we view we coughing run
But that once meteor drawn all cry undone

 IV
How bright the fair Paulina734 did appear
When hid in jewels she did seem a star
 But who could soberly behold
 A wicked owl in cloath of gold
 Or the ridiculous Ape
 In sacred Vestas shape
 So doth agree
 Just praise with thee
For since thy birth gave thee no beauty know
No poets pencil must or can do so

731 The constellation so called In old drawings Cassiopeia
is represented as a woman sitting in a chair with a branch in her
hand and hence the allusion here Dixon in his CANIDIA 1683
part i p 35 makes his witches say

 We put on Berenices hair
 And sit in Cassiopeias chair

Randolph couples it with Ariadnes Crowne in the following
passage

 Shine forth a constellation full and bright
 Bless the poor heavens with more majestick light
 Who in requitall shall present you there

 THE DUELL

 I
Love drunk the other day knockt at my brest
 But I alas was not within
My man my ear told me he came t attest
 That without cause hd boxed him
And battered the windows of mine eyes
And took my heart for one ofs nunneries

 II
I wondred at the outrage safe returnd
 And stormed at the base affront
And by a friend of mine bold faith that burnd
 I called him to a strict accompt
He said that by the law the challengd might
Take the advantage both of arms and fight

 III
Two darts of equal length and points he sent
 And nobly gave the choyce to me
Which I not weighd young and indifferent
 Now full of nought but victorie
So we both met in one ofs mothers groves
The time at the first murmring of her doves

 IV
I stript myself naked all ore as he
 For so I was best armd when bare
His first pass did my liver rase yet I
 Made home a falsify741 too neer
For when my arm to its true distance came
I nothing touchd but a fantastick flame

 V
This this is love we daily quarrel so
 An idle DonQuichoterie
We whip our selves with our own twisted wo
 And wound the ayre for a fly
The only way t undo this enemy
Is to laugh at the boy and he will cry

741 To falsify a thrust says Phillips WORLD OF WORDS
ed 1706 art FALSIFY is to make a feigned pass Lovelace
here employs the word as a substantive rather awkwardly but
the meaning is no doubt the same



 CUPID FAR GONE

 I
What so beyond all madnesse is the elf
 Now he hath got out of himself
 His fatal enemy the Bee
 Nor his deceivd artillerie
 His shackles nor the roses bough
Ner half so netled him as he is now

 II751
See ats own mother he is offering
 His finger now fits any ring
 Old Cybele he would enjoy
 And now the girl and now the boy
 He proffers Jove a back caresse
And all his love in the antipodes

 III
Jealous of his chast Psyche raging he
 Quarrels with752 student Mercurie
 And with a proud submissive breath
 Offers to change his darts with Death
 He strikes at the bright eye of day
And Juno tumbles in her milky way

 IV
The dear sweet secrets of the gods he tells
 And with loathd hate lovd heaven he swells
 Now like a fury he belies
 Myriads of pure virginities
 And swears with this false frenzy hurld
Theres not a vertuous she in all the world

 V
Olympus he renownces then descends
 And makes a friendship with the fiends
 Bids Charon be no more a slave
 He Argos riggd with stars shall have
 And triple Cerberus from below
Must leashd t himself with him a hunting go

 A MOCK SONG

 I
 Now Whitehalls in the grave
 And our head is our slave
The bright pearl in his close shell of oyster
 Now the miter is lost
 The proud Praelates too crost
And all Romes confind to a cloister
 He that Tarquin was styld
 Our white lands exild
 Yea undefild
Not a court apes left to confute us
 Then let your voyces rise high
 As your colours did flye
 And flourshing cry
Long live the brave OliverBrutus761

 II
 Now the sun is unarmd
 And the moon by us charmd
All the stars dissolvd to a jelly
 Now the thighs of the Crown
 And the arms are loppd down
And the body is all but a belly
 Let the Commons go on
 The town is our own
 Wel rule alone
For the Knights have yielded their spentgorge
 And an order is tane
 With HONY SOIT profane
 Shout forth amain
For our Dragon hath vanquishd the St George

 A FLY CAUGHT IN A COBWEB

Small type of great ones that do hum
Within this whole worlds narrow room
That with a busie hollow noise
Catch at the peoples vainer voice
And with spread sails play with their breath
Whose very hails new christen death
Poor Fly caught in an airy net
Thy wings have fetterd now thy feet
Where like a Lyon in a toyl
Howere thou keepst a noble coyl
And beatst thy genrous breast that ore
The plains thy fatal buzzes rore
Till thy allbellyd foe round elf771
Hath quarterd thee within himself

 Was it not better once to play
I th light of a majestick ray
Where though too neer and bold the fire
Might sindge thy upper down attire
And thou i th storm to loose an eye
A wing or a selftrapping thigh
Yet hadst thou faln like him whose coil
Made fishes in the sea to broyl
When now thast scapd the noble flame
Trappd basely in a slimy frame
And free of air thou art become
Slave to the spawn of mud and lome

 Nor ist enough thy self dos dresse
To thy swoln lord a numrous messe
And by degrees thy thin veins bleed
And piecemeal dost his poyson feed
But now devourd art like to be
A net spun for thy familie
And straight expanded in the air
Hangst for thy issue too a snare
Strange witty death and cruel ill
That killing thee thou thine dost kill
Like pies in whose entombed ark
All fowl crowd downward to a lark
Thou art thine enmies sepulcher
And in thee buriest too thine heir

 Yet Fates a glory have reservd
For one so highly hath deservd
As the rhinoceros doth dy
Under his castleenemy
As through the cranes trunk throat doth speed
The aspe doth on his feeder feed
Fall yet triumphant in thy woe
Bound with the entrails of thy foe

 A FLY ABOUT A GLASSE OF BURNT CLARET

 I
Forbear this liquid fire Fly
It is more fatal then the dry
That singly but embracing wounds
And this at once both burns and drowns

 II
The salamander that in heat
And flames doth cool his monstrous sweat
Whose fan a glowing cake is said
Of this red furnace is afraid

 III
Viewing the rubychristal shine
Thou takst it for heavenchristalline
Anon thou wilt be taught to groan
Tis an ascended Acheron

 IV
A snowball heart in it let fall
And take it out a fireball
Ali icy breast in it betrayd
Breaks a destructive wild granade

 V
Tis this makes Venus altars shine
This kindles frosty Hymens pine
When the boy grows old in his desires
This flambeau doth new light his fires

 VI
Though the cold hermit over wail
Whose sighs do freeze and tears drop hail
Once having passd this will ner
Another flaming purging fear

The vestal drinking this doth burn
Now more than in her funral urn
Her fires that with the sun kept race
Are now extinguishd by her face

 VIII
The chymist that himself doth still781
Let him but tast this limbecks782 bill
And prove this sublimated bowl
Hell swear it will calcine a soul

 IX
Noble and brave now thou dost know
The false prepared decks below
Dost thou the fatal liquor sup
One drop alas thy barque blowes up

 X
What airy country hast to save
Whose plagues thoult bury in thy grave
For even now thou seemst to us
On this gulphs brink a Curtius

 XI
And now th art faln magnanimous Fly
In where thine Ocean doth fry
Like the Suns son who blushd the flood
To a complexion of blood

 XII
Yet see my glad auricular
Redeems thee though dissolvd a star
Flaggy783 thy wings and scorchd thy thighs
Thou lyst a double sacrifice

 XIII
And now my warming cooling breath
Shall a new life afford in death
See in the hospital of my hand
Already curd thou fierce dost stand

 XIV
Burnt insect dost thou reaspire
The moisthotglasse and liquid fire
I see tis such a pleasing pain
Thou wouldst be scorchd and drownd again

 FEMALE GLORY

Mongst the worlds wonders there doth yet remain
One greater than the rest thats all those ore again
And her own self beside A Lady whose soft breast
Is with vast honours soul and virtues life possest
Fair as original light first from the chaos shot
When day in virginbeams triumphd and night was not
And as that breath infusd in the newbreather good
When ill unknown was dumb and bad not understood
Chearful as that aspect at this worlds finishing
When cherubims clappd wings and th sons of Heaven did sing
Chast as th Arabian bird who all the ayr denyes791
And evn in flames expires when with her selfe she lyes
Oh shes as kind as drops of new faln April showers
That on each gentle breast spring fresh perfuming flowers
Shes constant genrous fixt shes calm she is the all
We can of vertue honour faith or glory call
And she is whom I thus transmit to endless fame
Mistresse oth world and me and LAURA is her name

 THE TOAD AND SPYDER

 A DUELL

 Upon a day when the Dogstar
Unto the world proclaimd a war
And poyson barkd from black throat
And from his jaws infection shot
Under a deadly henbane shade
With slime infernal mists are made
Met the two dreaded enemies
Having their weapons in their eyes

 First from his den rolls forth that load
Of spite and hate the speckld toad
And from his chaps a foam doth spawn
Such as the loathed three heads yawn
Defies his foe with a fell spit
To wade through death to meet with it
Then in his self the lymbeck turns
And his elixird poyson urns
Arachne once the fear oth maid821
Coelestial thus unto her prayd
Heavens bleweyd daughter thine own mother
The Pythonkilling Suns thy brother
Oh thou from gods that didst descend
With a poor virgin to contend
Shall seed of earth and hell ere be
A rival in thy victorie
Pallas assents for now long time
And pity had clean rinsd her crime
When straight she doth with active fire
Her many legged foe inspire
Have you not seen a charact822 lie
A great cathedral in the sea
Under whose Babylonian walls
A small thin frigot almshouse stalls
So in his slime the toad doth float
And th spyder by but seems his boat
And now the naumachie823 begins
Close to the surface her self spins
Arachne when her foe lets flye
A broadside of his breath too high
Thats overshot the wiselystout
Advised maid doth tack about
And now her pitchy barque doth sweat
Chafd in her own black fury wet
Lasie and cold before she brings
New fires to her contracted stings
And with discolourd spumes doth blast
The herbs that to their center hast
Now to the neighbring henbane top
Arachne hath her self wound up
And thence from its dilated leaves
By her own cordage downwards weaves
And doth her town of foe attack824
And storms the rampiers825 of his back
Which taken in her colours spread
March to th citadel ofs head
Now as in witty torturing Spain
The brain is vext to vex the brain
Where hereticks bare heads are armd
In a close helm and in it charmd
An overgrown and meagre rat
That peecemeal nibbles himself fat
So on the toads blewchecquerd scull
The spider gluttons her self full
And vomiting her Stygian seeds
Her poyson on his poyson feeds
Thus the invenomd toad now grown
Big with more poyson than his own
Doth gather all his powrs and shakes
His stormer ins disgorged lakes
And wounded now apace crawls on
To his next plantane surgeon826
With whose rich balm no sooner drest
But purged is his sick swoln breast
And as a glorious combatant
That only rests awhile to pant
Then with repeated strength and scars
That smarting fire him new to wars
Deals blows that thick themselves prevent
As they would gain the time he spent

 So the disdaining angry toad
That calls but a thin useless load
His fatal feared self comes back
With unknown venome filld to crack
Th amased spider now untwind
Hath crept up and her self new lind
With fresh salt foams and mists that blast
The ambient air as they past
And now me thinks a Sphynxs wing
I pluck and do not write but sting
With their black blood my pale inks blent827
Galls but a faint ingredient
The poltick toad doth now withdraw
Warnd higher in CAMPANIA828
There wisely doth intrenched deep
His body in a body keep
And leaves a wide and open pass
T invite the foe up to his jaws
Which there within a foggy blind
With fourscore firearms were lind
The genrous active spider doubts
More ambuscadoes than redoubts
So within shot she doth pickear829
Now galls the flank and now the rear
As that8210 the toad ins own dispite
Must change the manner of his fight
Who like a glorious general
With one homecharge lets fly at all
Chafd with a fourfold venmous foam
Of scorn revenge his foes and s own
He seats him in his loathed chair
Newmade him by each mornings air
With glowing eyes he doth survey
Th undaunted hoast he calls his prey
Then his dark spume he gredly laps
And shows the foe his grave his chaps

 Whilst the quick wary Amazon
Of vantage takes occasion
And with her troop of leggs carreers
In a full speed with all her speers
Down as some mountain on a mouse
On her small cot he flings his house
Without the poyson of the elf
The toad had like t have burst himself
For sage Arachne with good heed
Had stopt herself upon full speed
And s body now disorderd on
She falls to execution
The passive toad now only can
Contemn and suffer Here began
The wronged maids ingenious rage
Which his heart venome must asswage
One eye she hath spet out strange smother
When one flame doth put out another
And one eye wittily spard that he
Might but behold his miserie
She on each spot a wound doth print
And each speck hath a sting withint
Till he but one new blister is
And swells his own periphrasis
Then fainting sick and yellowpale
She baths him with her sulphrous stale
Thus slacked is her Stygian fire
And she vouchsafes now to retire
Anon the toad begins to pant
Bethinks him of th almighty plant
And lest he peecemeal should be sped
Wisely doth finish himself dead
Whilst the gay girl as was her fate
Doth wanton and luxuriate
And crowns her conquring head all or
With fatal leaves of hellebore
Not guessing at the pretious aid
Was lent her by the heavenly maid
The neer expiring toad now rowls
Himself in lazy bloody scrowls
To th sovraign salve of all his ills
That only life and health distills
But loe a terror above all
That ever yet did him befall

 Pallas still mindful of her foe
Whilst they did with each fires glow
Had to the place the spiders lar
Dispathd before the evnings star
He learned was in Natures laws
Of all her foliage knew the cause
And mongst the rest in his choice want
Unplanted had this plantane plant

 The allconfounded toad doth see
His life fled with his remedie
And in a glorious despair
First burst himself and next the air
Then with a dismal horred yell
Beats down his loathsome breath to hell

 But what inestimable bliss
This to the sated virgin is
Who as before of her fiend foe
Now full is of her goddess too
She from her fertile womb hath spun
Her stateliest pavillion
Whilst all her silken flags display
And her triumphant banners play
Where Pallas she ith midst doth praise
And counterfeits her brothers rayes
Nor will she her dear lar forget
Victorious by his benefit
Whose roof inchanted she doth free
From haunting gnat and goblin bee
Who trappd in her prepared toyle
To their destruction keep a coyle

 Then she unlocks the toads dire head
Within whose cell is treasured
That pretious stone which she doth call
A noble recompence for all
And to her lar doth it present
Of his fair aid a monument

821 It will be seen that this poem partly turns on the
mythological tale of Arachne and Minerva and the metamorphosis
of the former by the angry goddess into a spider arachne

822 ie CARAK or CARRICK as the word is variously spelled
This large kind of ship was much used by the Greeks and Venetians
during the middle ages and also by other nations

823 The poet rather awkwardly sustains his simile and
employs in expressing a contest between the toad and the
spider a term signifying a naval battle or at least
a fight between two ships

824 Lovelaces fondness for military similitudes is constantly
standing in the way and marring his attempts at poetical imagery

825 A form of RAMPART sanctioned by Dryden

826 Medicinal herb or plant

827 Blended

828 CAMPANIA may signify in the present passage either
a field or the country generally or a plain It is a clumsy
expression

829 In the sense in which it is here used this word seems
to be peculiar to Lovelace TO PICKEAR or PICKEER means
TO SKIRMISH

8210 So that



 THE SNAYL

 Wise emblem of our politick world
Sage Snayl within thine own self curld
Instruct me softly to make hast
Whilst these my feet go slowly fast

 Compendious Snayl thou seemst to me
Large Euclids strict epitome
And in each diagram dost fling
Thee from the point unto the ring
A figure now trianglare
An oval now and now a square
And then a serpentine dost crawl
Now a straight line now crookd now all

 Preventing831 rival of the day
Th art up and openest thy ray
And ere the morn cradles the moon832
Th art broke into a beauteous noon
Then when the Sun sups in the deep
Thy silver horns ere Cinthias peep
And thou from thine own liquid bed
New Phoebus heavst thy pleasant head

 Who shall a name for thee create
Deep riddle of mysterious state
Bold Nature that gives common birth
To all products of seas and earth
Of thee as earthquakes is afraid
Nor will thy dire delivry aid

 Thou thine own daughter then and sire
That son and mother art intire
That big still with thy self dost go
And livst an aged embrio
That like the cubbs of India
Thou from thy self a while dost play
But frighted with a dog or gun
In thine own belly thou dost run
And as thy house was thine own womb
So thine own womb concludes thy tomb

 But now I must analysd king
Thy oeconomick virtues sing
Thou great stayd husband still within
Thou thee thats thine dost discipline
And when thou art to progress bent
Thou movst thy self and tenement
As warlike Scythians travayld you
Remove your men and city too
Then after a sad dearth and rain
Thou scatterest thy silver train
And when the trees grow nakd and old
Thou cloathest them with cloth of gold
Which from thy bowels thou dost spin
And draw from the rich mines within

 Now hast thou changd thee saint and made
Thy self a fane thats cupulad
And in thy wreathed cloister thou
Walkest thine own gray fryer too
Strickt and lockd up thart hood all ore
And ner eliminatst thy dore
On sallads thou dost feed severe
And stead of beads thou dropst a tear
And when to rest each calls the bell
Thou sleepst within thy marble cell
Where in dark contemplation placd
The sweets of Nature thou dost tast
Who now with time thy days resolve
And in a jelly thee dissolve
Like a shot star which doth repair
Upward and rarifie the air

831 Anticipating forerunning

832 It can scarcely be requisite to mention that Lovelace
refers to the gradual evanescence of the moon before the growing
daylight It is well known that the lunar orb is at certain
times visible sometime even after sunrise



 ANOTHER

The Centaur Syren I foregoe
Those have been sung and lowdly too
Nor of the mixed Sphynx Ile write
Nor the renownd Hermaphrodite
Behold this huddle doth appear
Of horses coach and charioteer
That moveth him by traverse law
And doth himself both drive and draw
Then when the Sunn the south doth winne
He baits him hot in his own inne
I heard a grave and austere clark
Resolvd him pilot both and barque
That like the famd ship of TREVERE
Did on the shore himself lavere
Yet the authentick do beleeve
Who keep their judgement in their sleeve
That he is his own double man
And sick still carries his sedan
Or that like dames ith land of Luyck
He wears his everlasting huyck841
But banisht I admire his fate
Since neither ostracisme of state
Nor a perpetual exile
Can force this virtue change his soyl
For wheresoever he doth go
He wanders with his country too

841 iq HUKE Huke says Minshen is a mantle such as
women use in Spaine Germanie and the Low Countries when they
goe abroad Lovelace clearly adopts the word for the sake of
the metre otherwise he might have chosen a better one



 THE TRIUMPHS OF PHILAMORE AND AMORET

 TO THE NOBLEST OF OUR YOUTH AND BEST OF FRIENDS
 CHARLES COTTON Esquire85l

BEING AT BERISFORD AT HIS HOUSE IN STAFFORDSHIRE
 FROM LONDON

 A POEM

 Sir your sad absence I complain as earth
Her longhid spring that gave her verdures birth
Who now her cheerful aromatick head
Shrinks in her cold and dismal widowd bed
Whilst the false sun her lover doth him move
Below and to th antipodes make love

 What fate was mine when in mine obscure cave
Shut up almost close prisoner in a grave
Your beams could reach me through this vault of night
And canton the dark dungeon with light
Whence me as genrous Spahys you unbound
Whilst I now know my self both free and crownd

 But as at Mecchas tombe the devout blind
Pilgrim great husband of his sight and mind
Pays to no other object this chast prise
Then with hot earth anoynts out both his eyes
So having seen your dazling glories store
It is enough and sin for to see more

 Or do you thus those pretious rayes withdraw
To whet my dull beams keep my bold in aw
Or are you gentle and compassionate
You will not reach me Regulus his fate
Brave prince who eagleeyd of eagle kind
Wert blindly damnd to look thine own self blind

 But oh return those fires too cruelnice
For whilst you fear me cindars see Im ice
A nummed speaking clod and mine own show852
My self congeald a man cut out in snow
Return those living fires Thou who that vast
Double advantage from oneeyd Heavn hast
Look with one sun though t but obliquely be
And if not shine vouchsafe to wink on me

 Perceive you not a gentle gliding heat
And quickning warmth that makes the statua sweat
As revrend Ducaleons blackflung stone
Whose rough outside softens to skin anon
Each crusty vein with wet red is supplid
Whilst nought of stone but in its heart doth bide

 So from the rugged north where your soft stay
Hath stampt them a meridian and kind day
Where now each A LA MODE inhabitant
Himself and s manners both do pay you rent
And bout your house your pallace doth resort
And spite of fate and war creates a court

 So from the taught north when you shall return
To glad those looks that ever since did mourn
When men uncloathed of themselves youl see
Then start new made fit what they ought to be
Hast hast you that your eyes on rare sights feed
For thus the golden triumph is decreed

 The twiceborn god still gay and ever young
With ivie crownd first leads the glorious throng
He Ariadnes starry coronet
Designs for th brighter beams of Amoret
Then doth he broach his throne and singing quaff
Unto her health his pipe of godhead off

 Him follow the recanting vexing Nine
Who wise now sing thy lasting fame in wine
Whilst Phoebus not from th east your feast t adorn
But from th inspird Canaries rose this morn

 Now you are come winds in their caverns sit
And nothing breaths but newinlarged wit
Hark One proclaims it piacle853 to be sad
And th people call t religion to be mad

 But now as at a coronation
When noyse the guard and trumpets are oreblown
The silent commons mark their princes way
And with still reverence both look and pray
So they amazd expecting do adore
And count the rest but pageantry before

 Behold an hoast of virgins pure as th air
In her first face854 ere mists durst vayl her hair
Their snowy vests white as their whiter skin
Or their far chaster whiter thoughts within
Roses they breathd and strewd as if the fine
Heaven did to earth his wreath of swets resign
They sang aloud THRICE OH THRICE HAPPY THEY
THAT CAN LIKE THESE IN LOVE BOTH YIELD AND SWAY

 Next herald Fame a purple clowd her bears
In an imbroiderd coat of eyes and ears
Proclaims the triumph and these lovers glory
Then in a book of steel records the story

 And now a youth of more than godlike form
Did th inward minds of the dumb throng alarm
All nakd each part betrayd unto the eye
Chastly for neither sex owd he or she
And this was heavnly love By his bright hand
A boy of worse than earthly stuff did stand
His bow broke his fires out and his wings clipt
And the black slave from all his false flames stript
Whose eyes were newrestord but to confesse
This days bright blisse and his own wretchednesse
Who swelld with envy bursting with disdain
Did cry to cry and weep them out again

 And now what heavn must I invade what sphere
Rifle of all her stars t inthrone her there
No Phoebus by thy boys855 fate we beware
Th unruly flames oth firebrand thy carr
Although she there once placd thou Sun shouldst see
Thy day both nobler governed and thee
Drive on Bootes thy cold heavy wayn
Then grease thy wheels with amber in the main
And Neptune thou to thy false Thetis gallop
Appollos set within thy bed of scallop
Whilst Amoret on the reconciled winds
Mounted and drawn by six caelestial minds
She armed was with innocence and fire
That did not burn for it was chast desire
Whilst a new light doth gild the standers by
Behold it was a day shot from her eye
Chafing perfumes oth East did throng and sweat
But by her breath they melting back were beat
A crown of yetnerelighted stars she wore
In her soft hand a bleeding heart she bore
And round her lay of broken millions more856
Then a wingd crier thrice aloud did call
LET FAME PROCLAIM THIS ONE GREAT PRISE FOR ALL

 By her a lady that might be calld fair
And justly but that Amoret was there
Was prisner led th unvalewed robe she wore
Made infinite lay lovers to adore
Who vainly tempt her rescue madly bold
Chained in sixteen thousand links of gold
Chrysetta thus loaden with treasures slave
Did strow the pass with pearls and her way pave

 But loe the glorious cause of all this high
True heavnly state brave Philamore draws nigh
Who not himself more seems himself to be
And with a sacred extasie doth see
Fixd and unmovd on s pillars he doth stay
And joy transforms him his own statua
Nor hath he powr to breath nor strength to greet
The gentle offers of his Amoret
Who now amazd at s noble breast doth knock
And with a kiss his genrous heart unlock
Whilst she and the whole pomp doth enter there
Whence her nor Time nor Fate shall ever tear
But whether am I hurld ho back awake
From thy glad trance to thine old sorrow take
Thus after view of all the Indies store
The slave returns unto his chain and oar
Thus poets who all night in blest heavns dwell
Are calld next morn to their true living hell
So I unthrifty to myself untrue
Rise cloathd with real wants cause wanting you
And what substantial riches I possesse
I must to these unvalued dreams confesse

 But all our clowds shall be oreblown when thee
In our horizon bright once more we see
When thy dear presence shall our souls newdress
And spring an universal cheerfulnesse
When we shall be orewhelmd in joy like they
That change their night for a vast halfyears day

 Then shall the wretched few that do repine
See and recant their blasphemies in wine
Then shall they grieve that thought Ive sung too free
High and aloud of thy true worth and thee
And their fowl heresies and lips submit
To th allforgiving breath of Amoret
And me alone their angers object call
That from my height so miserably did fall
And crie out my invention thin and poor
Who have said nought since I could say no more

on the 28th of April 1630 He married in 1656 Isabella
daughter of Sir Thomas Hutchinson of Owthorp co Notts Knight
See Waltons ANGLER ed 1760 where a life of Cotton compiled
from the notes of the laborious Oldys will be found The poet
died in 1687 and two years later his miscellaneous verses were
printed in an octavo volume

properly AN ATONEMENT was afterwards used to express WHAT
REQUIRED an atonement ie an offence or sin

certainly preferable but the reader may judge for himself
It should be borne in mind that the second part of LUCASTA
was not even printed during the poets life If he had survived
to republish the first portion and to revise the second perhaps
we should have had a better text



 ADVICE TO MY BEST BROTHER
 COLL FRANCIS LOVELACE861

 Frank wilt live unhandsomely trust not too far
Thy self to waving seas for what thy star
Calculated by sure event must be
Look in the glassyepithete862 and see

 Yet settle here your rest and take your state
And in calm halcyons nest evn build your fate
Prethee lye down securely Frank and keep
With as much no noyse the inconstant deep
As its inhabitants nay stedfast stand
As if discoverd were a Newfoundland
Fit for plantation here Dream dream still
Lulld in Diones cradle dream untill
Horrour awake your sense and you now find
Your self a bubbled pastime for the wind
And in loose Thetis blankets torn and tost
Frank to undo thy self why art at cost

 Nor be too confident fixd on the shore
For even that too borrows from the store
Of her rich neighbour since now wisest know
And this to Galileos judgement ow
The palsie earth it self is every jot
As frail inconstant waveing as that blot
We lay upon the deep that sometimes lies
Changd you would think with s botoms properties
But this eternal strange Ixions wheel
Of giddy earth neer whirling leaves to reel
Till all things are inverted till they are
Turnd to that antick confusd state they were

 Who loves the golden mean doth safely want
A cobwebbd cot and wrongs entaild upont
He richly needs a pallace for to breed
Vipers and moths that on their feeder feed
The toy that we too true a mistress call
Whose lookingglass and feather weighs up all
And cloaths which larks would play with in the sun
That mock him in the night when s course is run

 To rear an edifice by art so high
That envy should not reach it with her eye
Nay with a thought come neer it Wouldst thou know
How such a structure should be raisd build low
The blustring winds invisible rough stroak
More often shakes the stubbornst proprest oak
And in proud turrets we behold withal
Tis the imperial top declines to fall
Nor does Heavns lightning strike the humble vales
But highaspiring mounts batters and scales

 A breast of proof defies all shocks of Fate
Fears in the best hopes in worser state
Heaven forbid that as of old time ever
Flourishd in spring so contrary now never
That mighty breath which blew foul Winter hither
Can easly puffe it to a fairer weather
Why dost despair then Frank Aeolus has
A Zephyrus as well as Boreas

 Tis a false sequel soloecisme gainst those
Precepts by fortune givn us to suppose
That cause it is now ill t will ere be so
Apollo doth not always bend his bow
But oft uncrowned of his beams divine
With his soft harp awakes the sleeping Nine

 In strictest things magnanimous appear
Greater in hope howere thy fate then863 fear
Draw all your sails in quickly though no storm
Threaten your ruine with a sad alarm
For tell me how they differ tell me pray
A cloudy tempest and a too fair day

861 One of the younger brothers of the poet In the
year of the Restoration he filled the office of Recorder of
Canterbury and in that capacity delivered the address of the
city to Charles II on his passage through the place This
speech was printed in 1660 4to three leaves The following
extracts from the CALENDARS OF STATE PAPERS Domestic Series
16601 page 139 throw a little additional light on the
history of this person

1660 July 1Petition of Fras Lovelace Recorder of Canterbury
to the King for the stewardship of the liberties of St Augustine
near Canterbury for himself and his son Goldwell Has suffered
sequestration imprisonment and loss of office for his loyalty
WITH A NOTE OF THE REQUESTED GRANT FOR FRAS LOVELACE

Grant to Fras Lovelace of the office of chief steward of the
Liberties of the late monastery of St Augustine near Canterbury

ventures on a long sea voyage to look in the crystal or beryl
so popular at that time in order to read his fortune I must
confess my ignorance of the meaning of glassyepithete

 BROTHER MR R CAESAR871

Behold three sisterwonders in whom met
Distinct and chast the splendrous872 counterfeit873
Of Juno Venus and the warlike Maid
Each in their three divinities arrayd
The majesty and state of Heavns great Queen
And when she treats the gods her noble meen
The sweet victorious beauties and desires
O th seaborn princess empresse too of fires
The sacred arts and glorious lawrels torn
From the fair brow o th goddesse fatherborn
All these were quarterd in each snowy coat
With cantond874 honours of their own to boot
Paris by fate newwakd from his dead cell
Is chargd to give his doom impossible
He views in each the bravry875 of all Ide
Whilst one as once three doth his soul divide
Then sighs so equally theyre glorious all
WHAT PITY THE WHOLE WORLD IS BUT ONE BALL

871 Second son of Sir John Caesar Knt who was the second
surviving son of Sir Julius Caesar Knt Master of the Rolls
Mr Robert Caesar married the poets sister Johanna by whom
he had three daughters coheirsAnne Juliana and Johanna
These are the ladies commemorated in the text See Lodges
LIFE OF SIR JULIUS CAESAR 1827 p 54

872 Original reads SPLENDORS

873 This word is here used to signify simply RESEMBLANCE or
COPY

874 ie quartered CANTON in heraldry is a square space
at one of the corners of a shield of arms

875 Bravery here means as it often does in writers of and
before the time of Lovelace A BEAUTIFUL OR FINE SPECTACLE
or simply BEAUTY BRAVE in the sense of FINE gaudy or gallant
is still in use



 PEINTURE

A PANEGYRICK TO THE BEST PICTURE OF FRIENDSHIP
 MR PET LILLY

 If Pliny Lord High Treasurer of all881
Natures exchequer shuffled in this our ball882
Peinture her richer rival did admire
And cryd she wrought with more almighty fire
That judgd the unnumberd issue of her scrowl
Infinite and various as her mother soul
That contemplation into matter brought
Bodyd Ideas and could form a thought
Why do I pause to couch the cataract883
And the grosse pearls from our dull eyes abstract
That powrful Lilly now awakend we
This new creation may behold by thee

 To thy victorious pencil all that eyes
And minds call reach do bow The deities
Bold Poets first but feignd you do and make
And from your awe they our devotion take
Your beauteous pallet first defind Loves Queen
And made her in her heavnly colours seen
You strung the bow of the Bandite her son884
And tippd his arrowes with religion
Neptune as unknown as his fish might dwell
But that you seat him in his throne of shell
The thunderers artillery and brand
You fancied Rome in his fantastick hand
And the pale frights the pains and fears of hell
First from your sullen melancholy fell
Who cleft th infernal dogs loathd head in three
And spun out Hydras fifty necks by thee
As prepossessd w enjoy th Elizian plain
Which but before was flatterd885 in our brain
Who ere yet viewd airs child invisible
A hollow voice but in thy subtile skill
Faint stammring Eccho you so draw that we
The very repercussion do see
 CheatHOCUSPOCUSNature an assay886
O th spring affords us praesto and away887
You all the year do chain her and her fruits
Roots to their beds and flowers to their roots
Have not mine eyes feasted i th frozen Zone
Upon a fresh newgrown collation
Of apples unknown sweets that seemd to me
Hanging to tempt as on the fatal tree
So delicately limnd I vowd to try
My888 appetite imposd upon my eye889
 You sir alone fame and allconquring rime
File8810 the set teeth of alldevouring time
When beauty once thy vertuous paint hath on
Age needs not call her to vermilion
Her beams nere shed or change like th hair of day8811
She scatters fresh her everlasting ray
Nay from her ashes her fair virgin fire
Ascends that doth new massacres conspire
Whilst we wipe off the numrous score of years
And do behold our grandsires as our peers
With the first father of our house compare
We do the features of our newborn heir
For though each coppied a son they all
Meet in thy first and true original
 Sacred luxurious what princesse not
But comes to you to have her self begot
As when first man was kneaded from his side
Is born tos hand a readymadeup bride
He husband to his issue then doth play
And for more wives remove the obstructed way
So by your art you spring up in two noons
What could not else be formd by fifteen suns
Thy skill doth anmate the prolifick flood
And thy red oyl assimilates to blood
 Where then when all the world pays its respect
Lies our transalpine barbarous neglect
When the chast hands of powrful Titian
Had drawn the scourges of our God and man
And now the top of th altar did ascend
To crown the heavnly piece with a bright end
Whilst he who in8812 seven languages gave law
And always like the Sun his subjects saw
Did in his robes imperial and gold
The basis of the doubtful ladder hold
O Charls8813 a nobler monument than that
Which thou thine own executor wert at
When to our huffling Henry8814 there complaind
A grieved earl that thought his honor staind
Away frownd he for your own safeties hast
In one cheap hour ten coronets Il cast
But Holbeens noble and prodigious worth
Onely the pangs of an whole age brings forth8815
Henry a word so princely saving said
It might new raise the ruines thou hast made
 O sacred Peincture that dost fairly draw
What but in mists deep inward Poets saw
Twixt thee and an Intelligence no odds8816
That art of privy council to the gods
By thee unto our eyes they do prefer
A stamp of their abstracted character
Thou that in frames eternity dost bind
And art a written and a bodyd mind
To thee is ope the Juncto o th abysse
And its conspiracy detected is
Whilest their cabal thou to our sense dost show
And in thy square paintst what they threat below
 Now my best Lilly lets walk hand in hand
And smile at this ununderstanding land
Let them their own dull counterfeits adore
Their rainbowcloaths admire and no more
Within one shade of thine more substance is
Than all their varnishd idolmistresses
Whilst great Vasari and Vermander shall
Interpret the deep mystery of all
And I unto our modern Picts shall show
What due renown to thy fair art they owe
In the delineated lives of those
By whom this everlasting lawrel grows
Then if they will not gently apprehend
Let one great blot give to their fame an end
Whilst no poetick flower their herse doth dresse
But perish they and their effigies

881 An allusion is of course intended to Plinys
NATURAL HISTORY which through Hollands translation
became popular in England after 1601

882 ie in our globe

883 A term borrowed from the medical or rather surgical
vocabulary To couch a cataract ie in the eye is to
remove it by surgical process

884 An allusion to Lelys pictures of Venus and Cupid

885 Falsely portrayed

886 A glimpse

887 Some picture by Lely in which the painter introduced
a spring landscape is meant The poet feigns the copy of Nature
to be so close that one might suppose the Spring had set in
before the usual time The canvass is removed and the illusion
is dispelled Praesto tis away would be a preferable reading

888 ie if my appetite c Lovelaces style is elliptical
to an almost unexampled degree

889 The same story with variations has been told over and
over again since the time of Zeuxis

8810 Original edition has FILES

8811 HAIR is here used in what has become quite an obsolete
sense The meaning is outward form nature or character
The word used to be by no means uncommon but it is now
as was before remarked out of fashion and indeed I do not think
that it is found even in any old writer used exactly in the way
in which Lovelace has employed it

8812 Original reads TO

8813 Charles V

8814 Henry VIII

8815 A story too well known to require repetition The Earl
is not mentionedSee Walpoles ANECDOTES OF PAINTING ed 1862

AN ANNIVERSARY ON THE HYMENEALS OF MY NOBLE KINSMAN891
 THO STANLEY ESQUIRE892

 I
 The day is curld about agen
 To view the splendor she was in
 When first with hallowd hands
The holy man knit the mysterious bands
When you two your contracted souls did move
 Like cherubims above
 And did make love
As your ununderstanding issue now
In a glad sigh a smile a tear a vow

 II
 Tell me O selfreviving Sun
 In thy perigrination
 Hast thou beheld a pair
Twist their soft beams like these in their chast air
As from bright numberlesse imbracing rayes
 Are sprung th industrious dayes
 So when they gaze
And change their fertile eyes with the new morn
A beauteous offspring is shot forth not born

 III
 Be witness then allseeing Sun
 Old spy thou that thy race hast run
 In full five thousand rings893
To thee were ever purer offerings
Sent on the wings of Faith and thou O Night894
 Curtain of their delight
 By these made bright
Have you not markd their coelestial play
And no more peekd the gayeties of day

 IV
 Come then pale virgins roses strow
 Mingled with Ios as you go
 The snowy ox is killd
The fane with proslyte lads and lasses filld
You too may hope the same seraphic joy
 Old time cannot destroy
 Nor fulnesse cloy
When like these you shall stamp by sympathies
Thousands of newbornloves with your chaste eyes

891 Lovelace was connected with the Stanleys through the
Auchers The Kentish families about this time intermarried
with each other to a very large extent partly to indemnify
themselves from the consequences of gravelkind tenure though
many had procured parliamentary relief and the Lovelaces
the Stanleys the Hammonds the Sandyses were all more or less
bound together by the ties of kindred See the tree prefixed
by Sir Egerton Brydges to his edition of HAMMONDS POEMS 1816
and the Introduction to STANLEYS POEMS 1814 Sir William
Lovelace the poets grandfather married Elizabeth daughter
of Edward Aucher Esq of Bishopsbourne near Canterbury while
Sir William Hammond of St Albans Court married as his second
wife Elizabeth daughter of Anthony Aucher Esq of
Bishopsbourne by whom he had among other children Mary
who became the wife of Sir Thomas Stanley of Cumberlow father of
Thomas Stanley the poet historian and translator of Bion c

892 See THE POEMS OF WILLIAM HAMMOND 1655 edited by
Sir E Brydges 1816 p 54 where there is a similar poem
on Stanley and his bride from the pen of Hammond who also claimed
relationship with the then newlymarried poet The best account
of Stanley is in the reprint of his Poems and Translations 1814

ON SANAZARS BEING HONOURED WITH SIX HUNDRED DUCKETS
 BY THE CLARISSIMI OF VENICE
 FOR COMPOSING AN ELIGIACK HEXASTICK OF THE CITY

 A SATYRE

 Twas a blith prince901 exchangd five hundred crowns
For a fair turnip Dig dig on O clowns
But how this comes about Fates can you tell
This more then Maid of Meurs this miracle
Let me not live if I think not St Mark
Has all the oar as well as beasts ins ark
No wonder tis he marries the rich sea
But to betroth him to nakd Poesie
And with a bankrupt muse to merchandise
His treasures beams sure have put out his eyes902
His conquest at Lepanto903 Il let pass
When the sick sea with turbants nightcapd was
And now at Candie his full courage shown
That wand to a wan line the halfhalf moon904
This is a wreath this is a victorie
Caesar himself would have lookd pale to see
And in the height of all his triumphs feel
Himself but chaind to such a mighty wheel
 And now me thinks we ape Augustus state
So ugly we his high worth imitate
Monkey his godlike glories so that we
Keep light and form with such deformitie
As I have seen an arrogant baboon
With a small piece of glasse zany the sun
 Rome to her bard who did her battails sing
Indifferent gave to poet and to king
With the same lawrells were his temples fraught
Who best had written and who best had fought
The self same fame they equally did feel
Ones style adord as much as t others steel
A chain or fasces she could then afford
The sons of Phoebus we an axe or cord
Sometimes a coronet was her renown
And ours the dear prerogative of a crown
In marble statud walks great Lucan lay
And now we walk our own pale statua
They the whole year with roses crownd would dine
And we in all December know no wine
Disciplind dieted sure there hath bin
Ods twixt a poet and a Capuchin
 Of princes women wine to sing I see
Is no apocrypha for to rise high
Commend this olio of this lord tis fit
Nay ten to one but you have part of it
There is that justice left since you maintain
His table he should counterfeed your brain
Then write how well he in his sack hath drolld
Straight theres a bottle to your chamber rolld
Or with embroiderd words praise his French suit
Month hence tis yours with his mans to boot
Or but applaud his bossd legs two to none
But he most nobly doth give you one
Or spin an elegie on his false hair
Tis well he cries but living hair is dear
Yet say that out of order thers one curl
And all the hopes of your reward you furl905
 Write a deep epick poem and you may
As soon delight them as the opera
Where they Diogenes thought in his tub
Never so sowre did look so sweet a club
 You that do suck for thirst your black quils blood906
And chaw your labourd papers for your food
I will inform you how and what to praise
Then skin y in satin as young Lovelace plaies
Beware as you would your fierce guests your lice
To strip the cloath of gold from cherishd vice
Rather stand off with awe and reverend fear
Hang a poetick pendant in her ear
Court her as her adorers do their glasse
Though that as much of a true substance has
Whilst all the gall from your wild907 ink you drain
The beauteous sweets of vertues cheeks to stain
And in your livery let her be known
As poor and tatterd as in her own
Nor write nor speak you more of sacred writ
But what shall force up your arrested wit
Be chast religion and her priests your scorn
Whilst the vain fanes of idiots you adorn
It is a mortal errour you must know
Of any to speak good if he be so
Rayl till your edged breath flea908 your raw throat
And burn remarks909 on all of genrous note
Each verse be an indictment be not free
Sanctity t self from thy scurrility
Libel your father and your dam buffoon
The noblest matrons of the isle lampoon
Whilst Aretine and s bodies you dispute
And in your sheets your sister prostitute
 Yet there belongs a sweetnesse softnesse too
Which you must pay but first pray know to who
There is a creature if I may so call
That unto which they do all prostrate fall
Termd mistress when theyr angry but pleasd high
It is a princesse saint divinity
To this they sacrifice the whole days light
Then lye with their devotion all night
For this you are to dive to the abysse
And rob for pearl the closet of some fish
Arabia and Sabaea you must strip
Of all their sweets for to supply her lip
And steal new fire from heavn for to repair
Her unfledgd scalp with Berenices hair
Then seat her in Cassiopeias chair
As now youre in your coach save you bright sir
O spare your thanks is not this finer far
Then walk unhided when that every stone
Has knockd acquaintance with your anklebone
When your wingd papers like the last dove nere
Returnd to quit you of your hope or fear
But left you to the mercy of your host
And your days fare a fortified toast9010
 How many battels sung in epick strain
Would have procurd your head thatch from the rain
Not all the arms of Thebes and Troy would get
One knife but to anatomize your meat
A funeral elegie with a sad boon9011
Might make you hei sip wine like maccaroon9012
But if perchance there did a riband9013 come
Not the trainband so fierce with all its drum
Yet with your torch you homeward would retire
And heartly wish your bed your funral pyre
 With what a fury have I known you feed
Upon a contract and the hopes t might speed
Not the fair bride impatient of delay
Doth wish like you the beauties of that day
Hotter than all the roasted cooks you sat
To dresse the fricace of your alphabet
Which sometimes would be drawn dough anagrame9014
Sometimes acrostick parched in the flame9015
Then posies stewd with sippets mottos by
Of minced verse a miserable pye
How many knots slipd ere you twist their name
With th old device as both their hearts the same
Whilst like to drills the feast in your false jaw
You would transmit at leisure to your maw
Then after all your fooling fat and wine
Gluttond at last return at home to pine
 Tell me O Sun since first your beams did play
To night and did awake the sleeping day
Since first your steeds of light their race did start
Did you ere blush as now Oh thou that art
The common father to the base pissmire
As well as great Alcides did the fire
From thine owne altar which the gods adore
Kindle the souls of gnats and wasps before
 Who would delight in his chast eyes to see
Dormise to strike at lights of poesie
Faction and envy now are9016 downright rage
Once a fiveknotted whip there was the stage
The beadle and the executioner
To whip small errors and the great ones tear
Now as ere Nimrod the first king he writes
Thats strongest th ablest deepest bites
The muses weeping fly their hill to see
Their noblest sons of peace in mutinie
Could there nought else this civil war compleat
But poets raging with poetic heat
Tearing themselves and th endlesse wreath as though
Immortal they their wrath should be so too
And doubly fird Apollo burns to see
In silent Helicon a naumachie
Parnassus hears these at his first alarms
Never till now Minerva was in arms
 O more then conquror of the world great Rome
Thy heros did with gentleness ore come
Thy foes themselves but one another first
Whilst envy stript alone was left and burst
The learnd Decemviri tis true did strive
But to add flames to keep their fame alive
Whilst the eternal lawrel hung ith air
Nor of these ten sons was there found one heir
Like to the golden tripod it did pass
From this to this till t came to him whose twas
Caesar to Gallus trundled it and he
To Maro Maro Naso unto thee
Naso to his Tibullus flung the wreath
He to Catullus thus did bequeath
This glorious circle to another round
At last the temples of their god it bound
 I might believe at least that each might have
A quiet fame contented in his grave
Envy the living not the dead doth bite
For after death all men receave their right9017
If it be sacriledge for to profane
Their holy ashes what ist then their flame
He does that wrong unweeting9018 or in ire
As if one should put out the vestal fire
 Let earths four quarters speak and thou Sun bear
Now witnesse for thy fellowtraveller
I was allyd dear Uncle9019 unto thee
In blood but thou alas not unto me
Your vertues powrs and mine differd at best
As they whose springs you saw the east and west9020
Let me awhile be twisted in thy shine
And pay my due devotions at thy shrine
 Might learned Waynman9021 rise who went with thee
In thy heavns work beside divinity
I should sit still or mighty Falkland9022 stand
To justifie with breath his powrful hand
The glory that doth circle your pale urn
Might hallowd still and undefiled burn
But I forbear Flames that are wildly thrown
At sacred heads curle back upon their own
Sleep heavenly Sands whilst what they do or write
Is to give God himself and you your right
 There is not in my mind one sullen9023 fate
Of old but is concentred in our state
Vandall orerunners Goths in literature
Ploughmen that would Parnassus newmanure
Ringers of verse that allinchime
And toll the changes upon every rime
A mercer now by th yard does measure ore
An ode which was but by the foot before
Deals you an ell of epigram and swears
It is the strongest and the finest wears
No wonder if a drawer verses rack
If tis not his t may be the spirt of sack
Whilst the fair barmaid stroaks the muses teat
For milk to make the posset up compleat
 Arise thou revrend shade great Johnson rise
Break through thy marble natural disguise
Behold a mist of insects whose meer breath
Will melt thy hallowd leaden house of death
What was Crispinus9024 that you should defie
The age for him9025 He durst not look so high
As your immortal rod he still did stand
Honourd and held his forehead to thy brand
These scorpions with which we have to do
Are fiends not only small but deadly too
Well mightst thou rive thy quill up to the back
And scrue thy lyres grave chords untill they crack
For though once hell resented musick these
Divels will not but are in worse disease
How would thy mascline spirit father Ben
Sweat to behold basely deposed men
Justled from the prerogtive of their bed
Whilst wives are perwigd with their husbands head
Each snatches the male quill from his faint hand
And must both nobler write and understand
He to her fury the soft plume doth bow
O pen nere truely justly slit till now
Now as her self a poem she doth dresse
And curls a line as she would do a tresse
Powders a sonnet as she does her hair
Then prostitutes them both to publick aire
Nor is t enough that they their faces blind
With a false dye but they must paint their mind
In meeter scold and in scannd order brawl
Yet theres one Sapho9026 left may save them all
 But now let me recal my passion
Oh from a noble father nobler son
You that alone are the Clarissimi
And the whole genrous state of Venice be
It shall not be recorded Sanazar
Shall boast inthrond alone this new made star
You whose correcting sweetnesse hath forbad
Shame to the good and glory to the bad
Whose honour hath evn into vertue tamd
These swarms that now so angerly I namd
Forgive what thus distemperd I indite
For it is hard a SATYRE not to write
Yet as a virgin that heats all her blood
At the first motion of bad9027 understood
Then at meer thought of fair chastity
Straight cools again the tempests of her sea
 So when to you I my devotions raise
 All wrath and storms do end in calm and praise

901 Louis XI of France was the prince here intended See
MERY TALES AND QUICKE ANSWERS No 23 ed Hazlitt I fear
that if Lovelace had derived his knowledge of this incident
from the little work mentioned he would have been still more
sarcastic for Louis in the TALES AND QUICKE ANSWERS is made
to give not 500 crowns for a turnip but 1000 crowns for a radish

902 Perhaps Lovelace is rather too severe on Sannazaro That
writer is said to have occupied twenty years in the composition
of his poem on the Birth of the Saviour for which he probably
did not receive a sixth part of the sum paid to him for his
hexastic on Venice and so he deserved this little windfal which
came out of the pocket of a Government rich enough to pay it ten
times over See Cornianos VITA DI JACOPO SANNAZARO prefixed to
the edition of his ARCADIA published at Milan in 1806 Amongst
the translations printed at the end of LUCASTA and which it seems
very likely were among the earliest poetical essays of Lovelace
is this very epigram of Sannazaro As in the case of THE ANT
I have little doubt that the satire was suggested by the
translation

the Venetians defeated the Turks 1571

9010 A hard toasted crust

9011 A fee or gratuity given to a poet on a mournful occasion
and made more liberal by the circumstances of affliction in which
the donors are placed

9012 Generally a mere coxcomb or dandy but here the poet
implies a man about town who is rich enough to indulge
in fashionable luxuries

9013 The ribbon by which the star of an order of knighthood
was attached to the breast of the fortunate recipient It
sometimes also stood for the armlet worn by gentlemen in our
poets day as a mark of some ladys esteem See Shirleys
POEMS Works vi 440

9014 A crude anagram

9015 An imperfect acrostic Few readers require to be told
that anagrams and acrostics were formerly one of the most
fashionable species of composition Lovelace here pictures
a poetaster stewing his brains with a poem of this description
which of course demanded a certain amount of tedious and minute
attention to the arrangement of the name of the individual
to whom the anagram or acrostic was to be addressed and this
was especially the case where the writer contemplated
a DOUBLE acrostic

 To see them about nothing keep such a wil

Lord Falkland was a contributor to JONSONUS VIRBIUS 1638

 TO MY DEAR FRIEND MR ELDRED REVETT911
 ON HIS POEMS MORAL AND DIVINE

 Cleft as the top of the inspired hill
Struggles the soul of my divided quill
Whilst this foot doth the watry mount aspire
That Sinais living and enlivening fire
Behold my powers stormd by a twisted light
O th Sun and his first kindled his sight
And my lost thoughts invoke the prince of day
My right to th spring of it and him do pray

 Say happy youth crownd with a heavnly ray
Of the first flame and interwreathed bay
Inform my soul in labour to begin
Ios or Anthems Poeans or a Hymne
Shall I a hecatombe on thy tripod slay
Or my devotions at thy altar pay
While which t adore th amazd world cannot tell
The sublime Urim or deep oracle

 Heark how the moving chords temper our brain
As when Apollo serenades the main
Old Ocean smooths his sullen furrowd front
And Nereids do glide soft measures ont
Whilst th air puts on its sleekest smoothest face
And each doth turn the others lookingglasse
So by the sinewy lyre now strook we see
Into soft calms all storm of poesie
And former thundering and lightning lines
And verse now in its native lustre shines

 How wert thou hid within thyself how shut
Thy pretious Iliads lockd up in a nut
Not hearing of thee thou dost break out strong
Invading forty thousand men in song
And we secure in our thin empty heat
Now find ourselves at once surprised and beat
Whilst the most valiant of our wits now sue
Fling down their arms ask quarter too of you

 So cabind up in its disguisd coarse912 rust
And scurfd all ore with its unseemly crust
The diamond from midst the humbler stones
Sparkling shoots forth the price of nations
 Ye safe unriddlers of the stars pray tell
By what name shall I stamp my miracle
Thou strange inverted Aeson that leapst ore
From thy first infancy into fourscore
That to thine own self hast the midwife playd
And from thy brain springst forth913 the heavnly maid
Thou staffe of him bore914 him that bore our sins
Which but set down to bloom and bear begins
Thou rod of Aaron with one motion hurld
Budst915 a perfume of flowers through the world
You916 strange calcined917 seeds within a glass
Each species Idaea springst as twas
Bright vestal flame that kindled but evn now
For ever dost thy sacred fires throw

 Thus the repeated acts of Nestors age
That now had three times ore outlivd the stage
And all those beams contracted into one
Alcides in his cradle hath outdone

 But all these flourshing hiews with which I die
Thy virgin paper now are vain as I
For bove the poets Heavn th art taught to shine
And move as in thy proper crystalline
Whence that molehill Parnassus thou dost view
And us small ants there dabbling in its dew
Whence thy seraphic soul such hymns doth play
As those to which first danced the first day
Where with a thorn from the worldransoming wreath
Thou stung dost antiphons and anthems breathe
Where with an Angels quil dipd i th Lambs blood
Thou singst our Pelicans allsaving flood
And bathst thy thoughts in everliving streams
Renchd918 from earths tainted fat and heavy steams
There move translated youth inrolld i th quire
That only doth with wholy lays inspire
To whom his burning coach Eliah sent
And th royal prophetpriest his harp hath lent
Which thou dost tune in consort unto those
Clap wings for ever at each hallowd close
Whilst we now weak and fainting in our praise
Sick echo ore thy Halleluiahs

which will be found among the Elegies at the end of the volume

 ON THE BEST LAST AND ONLY REMAINING COMEDY
 OF MR FLETCHER

 THE WILD GOOSE CHASE921

 Im unoreclowded too free from the mist
The blind and late Heavenseyes great Occulist
Obscured with the false fires of his sceme
Not half those souls are lightned by this theme

 Unhappy murmurers that still repine
After th Eclipse our Sun doth brighter shine
Recant your false grief and your true joys know
Your blisse is endlesse as you feard your woe
What fortnate flood is this what storm of wit
Oh who would live and not orewhelmd in it
No more a fatal Deluge shall be hurld
This inundation hath savd the world
Once more the mighty Fletcher doth arise
Roabd in a vest studded with stars and eyes
Of all his former glories his last worth
Imbroiderd with what yet light ere brought forth
See in this glad farewel he doth appear
Stuck with the Constellations of his Sphere
Fearing we numbd feard no flagration
Hath curld all his fires in this one ONE
Which as they guard his hallowed chast urn
The dull aproaching hereticks do burn

 Fletcher at his adieu carouses thus
To the luxurious ingenious
As Cleopatra did of old outvie
Th unnumbred dishes of her Anthony
When he at th empty board a wonderer
Smiling she922 calls for pearl and vinegar
First pledges him ins BREATH then at one draught
Swallows THREE KINGDOMS of To HIS BEST THOUGHT

 Hear oh ye valiant writers and subscribe
His force set by yare conquerd by this bribe
Though you hold out your selves he doth commit
In this a sacred treason in your wit
Although in poems desperately stout
Give up this overture must buy you out

 Thus with some prodigal usrer t doth fare
That keeps his gold still vayld his steelbreast bare
That doth exceed his coffers all buts eye
And his eyes idol the wingd Deity
That cannot lock his mines with half the art
As some rich beauty doth his wretched heart
Wild at his real poverty and so wise
To win her turns himself into a prise
First startles her with th emerald MadLover923
The ruby Arcas924 least she should recover
Her dazled thought a Diamond he throws
Splendid in all the bright Aspatias woes925
Then to sum up the abstract of his store
He flings a rope of Pearl of forty926 more
Ah see the staggring virtue faints which he
Beholding darts his Wealths Epitome927
And now to consummate her wished fall
Shows this one Carbuncle that darkens all

 TO THE GENIUS OF MR JOHN HALL
 ON HIS EXACT TRANSLATION OF HIEROCLES
HIS COMMENT UPON THE GOLDEN VERSES OF PYTHAGORAS951

 Tis not from cheap thanks thinly to repay
Th immortal grove of thy fairorderd bay
Thou plantedst round my humble fane952 that I
Stick on thy hearse this sprig of Elegie
Nor that your soul so fast was linkd in me
That now Ive both sincet has forsaken thee
That thus I stand a Swisse before thy gate
And dare for such another time and fate
Alas our faiths made different essays
Our Minds and Merits brake two several ways
Justice commands I wake thy learned dust
And truth in whom all causes center must

 Behold when but a youth thou fierce didst whip
Upright the crooked age and gilt vice strip
A senator praetext953 that knewst to sway954
The fasces yet under the ferula
Rankd with the sage ere blossome did thy chin
Sleeked without and hair all ore within
Who in the school couldst argue as in schools
Thy lessons were evn academie rules
So that fair Cam saw thee matriculate
At once a tyro and a graduate

 At nineteen what ESSAYES955 have we beheld
That well might have the book of Dogmas swelld
Tough Paradoxes such as Tullys thou
Didst heat thee with when snowy was thy brow
When thy undownd face movd the Nine to shake
And of the Muses did a decad make
What shall I say by what allusion bold
NONE BUT THE SUN WAS ERE SO YOUNG AND OLD

 Young reverend shade ascend awhile whilst we
Now celebrate this posthume victorie
This victory that doth contract in death
Evn all the powrs and labours of thy breath
Like the Judean Hero956 in thy fall
Thou pullst the house of learning on us all
And as that soldier conquest doubted not
Who but one splinter had of Castriot957
But would assault evn death so strongly charmd
And naked oppose rocks with his958 bone959 armd
So we secure in this fair relique stand9510
The slings and darts shot by each profane hand
These soveraign leaves thou leftst us are become
Sear clothes against all Times infection

 Sacred Hierocles whose heavnly thought
First acted ore this comment ere it wrote9511
Thou hast so spirited elixird we
Conceive there is a noble alchymie
Thats turning of this gold to something more
Pretious than gold we never knew before
Who now shall doubt the metempsychosis
Of the great Author that shall peruse this
Let others dream thy shadow wandering strays
In th Elizian mazes hid with bays
Or that snatcht up in th upper region
Tis kindled there a constellation
I have informd me and declare with ease
THY SOUL IS FLED INTO HIEROCLES

and Worthy Life Translated by John Hall of Durham Esquire

me to rectify one or two errors of the press in LUCASTA

Classics then current

With royal fare to make the tables groan
Or else with what from Lybick fields is mown
Nor in one vault hoard all your magazine
But at no cowards fate t have frighted bin
Nor with the peoples breath to be swoln great
Nor at a drawn stiletto basely swear
He that dares this nothing to hims unfit

 TURNED THE AFFRONT TO HIS OWN GLORY IN THIS EPIGRAM

 Si Jaques le Roy du scavior
 Ne trouue bon de me voir
 Voila la cause infallible
 Car ravy de mon escrit
 Il creut que jestois tout esprit
 Et par consequent invisible

 LINEALLY TRANSLATED OUT OF THE FRENCH

 If James the king of wit
 To see me thought not fit
 Sure this the cause hath been
 That ravishd with my merit
 He thought I was all spirit
 And so not to be seen

 

 AUSONIUS

Vane quid affectas faciem mihi ponere pictor
 Ignotamque oculis solicitare manu
Aeris et venti sum filia mater inanis
 Indicii vocemque sine mente gero
Auribus in vestris habito penetrabilis echo
 Si mihi vis similem pingere pinge sonos

 IN ENGLISH

Vain painter why dost strive my face to draw
With busy hands a goddesse eyes nere saw
Daughter of air and wind I do rejoyce
In empty shouts without a mind a voice
Within your ears shrill echo I rebound
And if youl paint me like then paint a sound

 

 AUSONIUS

Toxica zelotypo dedit uxor maecha marito
 Nec satis ad mortem credidit esse datum
Miscuit argenti lethalia pondera vivi
 Ut celeret certam vis geminata necem
Ergo inter sese dum noxia pocula certant
 Cessit lethalis noxa saltuiferi
Protinus in vacuos alvi petiere recessus
 Lubrica dejectis quae via nota cibis
Quam pia cura Deum prodest crudelior uxor
Sic cum fata volunt bina venena juvant

 IN ENGLISH

Her jealous husband an adultresse gave
Cold poysons too weak she thought fors grave
A fatal dose of quicksilver then she
Mingles to hast his double destinie
Now whilst within themselves they are at strife
The deadly potion yields to that of life
And straight from th hollow stomack both retreat
To th slippery pipes known to digested meat
Strange care o th gods the murthresse doth avail
So when fates please evn double poysons heal

 

 AUSONIUS EPIG

Emptis quod libris tibi bibliotheca referta est
 Doctum et grammaticum te philomuse putas
Quinetiam cytharas chordas et barbita conde
 Mercator hodie cras citharoedus eris

 IN ENGLISH

Because with bought books sir your studys fraught
A learned grammarian you would fain be thought
Nay then buy lutes and strings so you may play
The merchant now the fidler the next day

Rure morans quid agam respondi pauca rogatus
Mane deum exoro famulos post arvaque viso

Tunc oleo corpus fingo mollique palaestra
Stringo libens animo gaudensque ac foenore liber

I dine drink sing play bath I sup I rest

 AD FABULLUM CATUL LIB I EP 13

Caenabis bene mi Fabulle apud me
Paucis si dii tibi favent diebus
Si tecum attuleris bonam atque magnam
Caenam non sine candida puella
Et vino et sale et omnibus cachinnis
Haec si inquam attuleris Fabulle noster
Caenabis bene nam tui Catulli
Plenus sacculus est aranearum
Sed contra accipies meros amores
Seu quod suavius elegantiusve est
Nam unguentum dabo quod meae puellae
Donarunt Veneres Cupidinesque
Quod tu cum olfacies deos rogabis
Totum te faciant Fabulle nasum

 ENGLISHED

Fabullus I will treat you handsomely
Shortly if the kind gods will favour thee
If thou dost bring with thee a delcate messe
An olio or so a pretty lass
Brisk wine sharp tales all sorts of drollery
These if thou bringst I say along with thee
You shall feed highly friend for know the ebbs
Of my lank purse are full of spiders webs
But then again you shall receive clear love
Or what more grateful or more sweet may prove
For with an ointment I will favour thee
My Venuss and Cupids gave to me
Of which once smelt the gods thou wilt implore
Fabullus that theyd make thee nose all ore

Casta suo gladium cum traderet Arria Paeto
 Quem de visceribus traxerat ipsa suis
Si qua fides vulnus quod feci non dolet inquit

When brave chast Arria to her Poetus gave
The sword from her own breast did bleeding wave
If there be faith this wound smarts not said she
But what youl make ah that will murder me

 

 MART EPI XLIII LIB I

Conjugis audisset fatum cum Portia Bruti
 Et substracta sibi quaereret arma dolor
Nondum scitis ait mortem non posse negari
 Credideram satis hoc vos docuisse patrem
Dixit et ardentes avido bibit ore favillas
 I nunc et ferrum turba molesta nega

 IN ENGLISH

When Portia her dear lords sad fate did hear
And noble grief sought arms were hid from her
Know you not yet no hinderance of death is
Cato I thought enough had taught you this
So said her thirsty lips drink flaming coales
Go now deny me steel officious fools

 Implicuit tenuem succina gutta feram
Dignum tantorum pretium tulit illa laborum
 Credibile est ipsam sic voluisse mori

Whilst in an ambershade the ant doth feast
A gummy drop ensnares the small wildbeast
A full reward of all her toyls hath she

 Ut videatur apis nectare clausa suo
Sic modo quae fuerat vita contempta manente

 IN RUFUM CATUL EP 64

Noli admirari quare tibi foemina nulla
 Rufe velit tenerum supposuisse femur
Non ullam rarae labefactes munere vestis
 Aut pellucidulis deliciis lapidis
Laedit te quaedam mala fabula qua tibi fertur
 Valle sub alarum trux habitare caper
Hunc metuunt omnes neque mirum nam mala valde est
 Bestia nec quicum1061 bela puella cubet
Quare aut crudelem nasorum interfice pestem
 Aut admirari desine cur fugiant

 TO RUFUS

That no fair woman will wonder not why
Clap Rufus under thine her tender thigh
Not a silk gown shall once melt one of them
Nor the delights of a transparent gemme
A scurvy story kills thee which doth tell
That in thine armpits a fierce goat doth dwell
Him they all fear full of an ugly stench1062
Nor s t fit he should lye with a handsome wench
Wherefore this noses cursed plague first crush
Or cease to wonder why they fly you thus

Dicit sed mulier cupido quod dicit amanti

No not if Jove himself a suitor be
She sayes so but what women say to kind
Lovers we write in rapid streams and wind

 

 AD LESBIAM CAT EP 73

Dicebas quondam solum to nosse Catullum
 Lesbia nec prae me velle tenere Jovem
Dilexi tum te non tantum ut vulgus amicam
 Sed pater ut gnatos diligit et generos
Nunc te cognovi quare et impensius uror
 Multo mi tamen es vilior et levior
Qui potis est inquis quod amantem injuria talis
 Cogat amare magis sed bene velle minus
Odi et amo quare id faciam fortasse requiris
 Nescio sed fieri sentio et excrucior

 ENGLISHED

That me alone you lovd you once did say
Nor should I to the king of gods give way
Then I lovd thee not as a common dear
But as a father doth his children chear
Now thee I know more bitterly I smart
Yet thou to me more light and cheaper art
What powr is this that such a wrong should press
Me to love more yet wish thee well much lesse
I hate and love wouldst thou the reason know
I know not but I burn and feel it so

 

 IN LESBIAM CAT EP 76

Huc est mens deducta tua mea Lesbia culpa
 Atque ita se officio perdidit ipsa suo
Ut jam nec bene velle queam tibi si optima sias
 Nec desistere amare omnia si facias

 ENGLISHED

By thy fault is my mind brought to that pass
That it its office quite forgotten has
For beest thou best I cannot wish thee well
And beest thou worst then I must love thee still

 Aut aliud si quid carius est oculis
Eripere ei noli multo quod carius illi
 Est oculis seu quid carius est oculis

 DE QUINTIA ET LESBIA EP 87

Quintia formosa est multis mihi candida longa
 Recta est haec ego sic singula confiteor
Tota illud formosa nego nam multa venustas
 Nulla in tam magno est corpore mica salis
Lesbia formosa est quae cum pulcherrima tota est
 Tum omnibus una omneis surripuit veneres

 ENGLISHED

Quintia is handsome fair tall straight all these
Very particulars I grant with ease
But she all ore s not handsome heres her fault
In all that bulk theres not one corne of salt
Whilst Lesbia fair and handsome too all ore
All graces and all wit from all hath bore

 

 DE SUO IN LESBIAM AMORE EP 88

 Vere quantum a me Lesbia amata mea est
Nulla fides ullo fuit unquam faedere tanta
 Quanta in amore suo ex parte reperta mea est

 TO THE MEMORY OF MY WORTHY FRIEND
 COLL RICHARD LOVELACE1081

 To pay my love to thee and pay it so
As honest men should what they justly owe
Were to write better of thy life then can
The assuredst pen of the most worthy man
Such was thy composition such thy mind
Improvd from vertue and from vice refind
Thy youth an abstract of the worlds best parts
Invrd to arms and exercisd to arts
Which with the vigour of a man became
Thine and thy countries piramids of fame
Two glorious lights to guide our hopeful youth
Into the paths of honour and of truth
 These parts so rarely met made up in thee
What man should in his full perfection be
So sweet a temper into every sence
And each affection breathd an influence
As smoothd them to a calme which still withstood
The ruffling passions of untamed blood
Without a wrinckle in thy face to show
Thy stable breast could a1082 disturbance know
In fortune humble constant in mischance
Expert in both and both servd to advance
Thy name by various trialls of thy spirit
And give the testimony of thy merit
Valiant to envy of the bravest men
And learned to an undisputed pen
Good as the best in both and great but yet
No dangerous courage nor offensive wit
These ever servd the one for to defend
The other nobly to advance thy friend
Under which title I have found my name
Fixd in the living chronicle of fame
To times succeeding yet I hence must go
Displeasd I cannot celebrate thee so
But what respect acknowledgement and love
What these together when improvd improve
Call it by any name so it express
Ought like a tribute to thy worthyness
And may my bounden gratitude become
LOVELACE I offer at thy honourd tomb
 And though thy vertues many friends have bred
To love thee liveing and lament thee dead
In characters far better couchd then these
Mine will not blott thy fame nor theirs encrease
Twas by thine own great merits raisd so high
That maugre time and fate it shall not dye
 Sic flevit

 SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF MY LATE HONOURED FRIEND
 COLLONELL RICHARD LOVELACE

 Pardon blest shade that I thus crowd to be
Mong those that sin unto thy memory
And that I think unvalud reliques spread
And am the first that pillages the dead
Since who would be thy mourner as befits
But an officious sacriledge commits
How my tears strive to do thee fairer right
And from the characters divide my sight
Untill it dimmer a new torrent swells
And what obscurd it falls my spectacles
 Let the luxurious floods impulsive rise
As they would not be wept but weep the eyes
The while earth melts and we above it lye
But the weak bubbles of mortalitie
Until our griefs are drawn up by the Sun
And that too drop the exhalation
How in thy dust we humble now our pride
And bring thee a whole people mortifid
For who expects not death now thou art gone
Shows his low folly not religion
 Can the poetick heaven still hold on
The golden dance when the first movers gon
And the snatchd fires which circularly hurld
In their strong rapture glimmer to the world
And not stupendiously rather rise
The tapers unto these solemnities
 Can the chords move in tune when thou dost dye
At once their universal harmony
But where Apollos harp with murmur laid
Had to the stones a melody conveyd
They by some pebble summond would reply
In loud results to every battery
Thus do we come unto thy marble room
To eccho from the musick of thy tombe
 May we dare speak thee dead that wouldest be
In thy remove only not such as we
No wonder the advance is from us hid
Earth could not lift thee higher then it did
And thou that didst grow up so ever nigh
Art but now gone to immortality
So near to where thou art thou here didst dwell
The change to thee is less perceptible
 Thy but unablycomprehending clay
To what could not be circumscribd gave way
And the more spacious tennant to return
Crackd in the two restraind estate its urn
That is but left to a successive trust
The souls first buried in his bodies dust
 Thou more thy self now thou art less confind
Art not concernd in what is left behind
While we sustain the losse that thou art gone
Unessencd in the separation
And he that weeps thy funerall in one
Is pious to the widdowd nation
 And under what now covert must I sing
Secure as if beneath a cherubs wing
When thou hast tane thy flight hence and art nigh
In place to some related hierarchie
Where a bright wreath of glories doth but set
Upon thy head an equal coronet
And thou above our humble converse gon
Canst but be reachd by contemplation
 Our lutes as thine was touchd were vocall by
And thence receivd the soul by sympathy
That did above the threds inspiring creep
And with soft whispers broke the amrous sleep
Which now no more movd with the sweet surprise
Awake into delicious rapsodies
But with their silent mistress do comply
And fast in undisturbed slumbers lye
 How from thy first ascent thou didst disperse
A blushing warmth throughout the universe
While near the morns Lucastas fires did glow
And to the earth a purer dawn did throw
We ever saw thee in the roll of fame
Advancing thy already deathless name
And though it could but be above its fate
Thou wouldst however supererrogate
 Now as in Venice when the wanton State
Before a Spaniard spread their crowded plate
He made it the sage business of his eye
To find the root of the wild treasury
So learnt from that exchequer but the more
To rate his masters vegetable ore
Thus when the Greek and Latin muse we read
As but the1101 cold inscriptions of the dead
We to advantage then admired thee
Who didst live on still with thy poesie
And in our proud enjoyments never knew
The end of the unruly wealth that grew
But now we have the last dear ingots gaind
And the free vein however rich is dreind
Though what thou hast bequeathed us no space
Of this worlds span of time shall ere embrace
But as who sometimes knew not to conclude
Upon the waters strange vicissitude
Did to the ocean himself commit
That it might comprehend what could not it
So we in our endeavours must outdone
Be swallowed up within thy Helicon
 Thou who1102 art layd up in thy precious cave
And from the hollow spaces of thy grave
We still may mourn in tune but must alone
Hereafter hope to quaver out a grone
No more the chirping sonnets with shrill notes
Must henceforth volley from our treble throtes
But each sad accent must be humourd well
To the deep solemn organ of thy cell
 Why should some rude hand carve thy sacred stone
And there incise a cheap inscription
When we can shed the tribute of our tears
So long till the relenting marble wears
Which shall such order in their cadence keep
That they a native epitaph shall weep
Untill each letter spelt distinctly lyes
Cut by the mystick droppings of our eyes

1101 Original has THE BUT

1102 Original has OW

1103 I have already pointed out that the author of these
truly wretched lines was probably the same person on whose
MORAL AND DIVINE POEMS Lovelace has some verses in the LUCASTA
The poems of E R appear to be lost which unless they were
far superior to the present specimen cannot be regarded as
a great calamity



 AN ELEGIE

Me thinks when kings prophets and poets dye
We should not bid men weep nor ask them why
But the great loss should by instinct impair
The nations like a pestilential ayr
And in a moment men should feel the cramp
Of grief like persons poysond with a damp
All things in nature should their death deplore
And the sun look less lovely than before
The fixed stars should change their constant spaces
And comets cast abroad their flagrant1111 faces
Yet still we see princes and poets fall
Without their proper pomp of funerall
Men look about as if they nere had known
The poets lawrell or the princes crown
Lovelace hath long been dead and he1112 can be
Obligd to no man for an elegie
Are you all turnd to silence or did he
Retain the only sap of poesie
That kept all branches living must his fall
Set an eternal period upon all
So when a springtide doth begin to fly1113
From the green shoar each neighbouring creek grows dry
But why do I so pettishly detract
An age that is so perfect so exact
In all things excellent it is a fame
Or glory to deceased Lovelace name
For he is weak in wit who doth deprave
Anothers worth to make his own seem brave
And this was not his aim nor is it mine
I now conceive the scope of their designe
Which is with one consent to bring and burn
Contributary incence on his urn
Where each mans love and fancy shall be tryd
As when great Johnson or brave Shakespear dyed
Wits must unite for ignorance we see
Hath got a great train of artillerie
Yet neither shall nor can it blast the fame
And honour of deceased Lovelace name
Whose own LUCASTA can support his credit
Amongst all such who knowingly have read it
But who that praise can by desert discusse
Due to those poems that are posthumous
And if the last conceptions are the best
Those by degrees do much transcend the rest
So full so fluent that they richly sute
With Orpheus lire or with Anacreons lute
And he shall melt his wing that shall aspire
To reach a fancy or one accent higher
Holland and France have known his nobler parts
And found him excellent in arms and arts
To sum up all few men of fame but know

UPON HIS EDITION OF HIS BROTHERS POEMS

 Thy pious hand planting fraternal bayes
Deserving is of most egregious praise
Since tis the organ doth to us convey
From a descended sun so bright a ray
Clear spirit how much we are bound to thee
For this so great a liberalitie
The truer worth of which by much exceeds
The western wealth which such contention breeds
Like the InfusingGod from the wellhead
Of poesie you have besprinkled
Our brows with holy drops the very last
Which from your Brothers happy pen were cast
Yet as the last the best such matchlesse skill
From his divine alembick did distill
Your honourd Brother in the Elyzian shade
Will joy to know himself a laureat made
By your religious care and that his urn
Doth him on earth immortal life return
Your self you have a good physician shown
To his much grieved friends and to your own
In giving this elixird medecine
For greatest grief a soveraign anodine
 Sir from your Brother y have conveyd us bliss
Now since your genius so concurs with his
Let your own quill our next enjoyments frame
All must be rich thats gracd with Lovelace name

 ON THE
 TRULY HONOURABLE COLL RICHARD LOVELACE
OCCASIONED BY THE PUBLICATION OF HIS POSTHUMEPOEMS

 ELEGIE

Great son of Mars and of Minerva too
With what oblations must we come to woo
Thy sacred soul to look down from above
And see how much thy memory we love
Whose happy pen so pleased amorous ears
And lifting bright LUCASTA to the sphears
Her in the starbespangled orb did set
Above fair Ariadnes coronet
Leaving a pattern to succeeding wits
By which to sing forth their Pythonick fits
Shall we bring tears and sighs no no then we
Should but bemone our selves for loosing thee
Or else thy happiness seem to deny
Or to repine at thy felicity
Then whilst we chant out thine immortal praise
Our offerings shall be onely sprigs of bays
And if our tears will needs their brinks outfly
Wel weep them forth into an elegy
To tell the world how deep fates wounded wit
When Atropos the lovely Lovelace hit
How th active fire which cloathd thy genrous mind
Consumd the water and the earth calcind
Untill a stronger heat by death was given
Which sublimated thy poor soul to heaven
Thou knewst right well to guide the warlike steed
And yet couldst court the Muses with full speed
And such success that the inspiring Nine
Have filld their Thespian fountain so with brine
Henceforth we can expect no lyrick lay
But biting satyres through the world must stray
Bellona joyns with fair Erato too
And with the Destinies do keep adoe
Whom thus she queries could not you awhile
Reprieve his life until another file
Of poems such as these had been drawn up
The fates replyd that thou wert taken up
A sacrifice unto the deities
Since things most perfect please their holy eyes
And that no other victim could be found
With so much learning and true virtue crownd
Since it is so in peace for ever rest
Tis very just that God should have the best
 Sym Ognell MD Coningbrens



 ON MY BROTHER

Lovelace is dead then let the world return
To its first chaos mufled in its urn
The stars and elements together lye
Drenchd in perpetual obscurity
And the whole machine in confusion be
As immethodick as an anarchie
May the great eye of day weep out his light
Pale Cynthia leave the regiment of night
The galaxia all in sables dight
Send forth no corruscations to our sight
The SisterGraces and the sacred Nine
Statud with grief attend upon his shrine
Whose worth whose loss should we but truly rate
Twould puzzle our arithmetic to state
Th accompt of vertus so transcendent high
Number and value reach infinity
Did I pronounce him dead no no he lives
And from his aromatique cell he gives
Spicebreathed fumes whose odoriferous scent
In zephregales which never can be spent
Doth spread it self abroad and much outvies
The eastern bird in her selfsacrifice
Or Father Phoebus who to th world derives
Such various and such multiformed lives
Took notice that brave Lovelace did inspire
The universe with his Promethean fire
And snatcht him hence before his thread was spun
Enving that here should be another Sun T L1131

1131 Thomas Lovelace one of the poets brothers



 ON THE DEATH OF MY DEAR BROTHER

 EPITAPH

Tread reader gently gently ore
The happy dust beneath this floor
For in this narrow vault is set
An alablaster cabinet
Wherein both arts and arms were put
Like Homers Iliads in a nut
Till Death with slow and easie pace
Snatcht the bright jewell from the case
And now transformd he doth arise
A constellation in the skies
Teaching the blinded world the way
Through night to startle into day
And shipwrackt shades with steady hand
He steers unto th Elizian land

Comments on the preparation of the EText


ANGLE BRACKETS

Any place where angle brackets are used ie   it is
a change made during the preparation of this EText
The original printed book did not use this character at all

SQUARE BRACKETS

The square brackets ie   are copied from the printed book
without change

FOOTNOTES

For this EText version of the book the footnotes have been
consolidated at the end of each section of the introduction
and at the end of each poem

Numbering of the footnotes has been changed and each footnote
is given a unique identity in the form XXYY where XX is
a poem or a section of the introduction and YY is the number
of the note within that poem or section

Some footnote markers are missing I have inserted markers where
I believe they should go All such markers are identified by
double brackets eg 92

There were 5 footnotes in an Additional Notes section of the
book and one footnote in the Table of Contents These footnotes
have been identified as AN1 to AN5 and TOC1 They
have been moved to the end of the appropriate sections of the
EText and footnote markers identified by double angle brackets
ie   have been added The original locations of these
footnotes in the body text however are also indicated for
information

LATIN AND GREEK POEMS

This EText contains some poems in Latin and in Greek

The Latin poems are reproduced as they appear in the book
except that the accent marks have been deleted

The Greek poems were originally typeset in Greek characters
For this EText the Greek characters have been TRANSLITERATED
into Roman characters using a system developed for the
US Library of Congress Ref

 ALALC ROMANIZATION TABLES
 TRANSLITERATION SCHEMES FOR NONROMAN SCRIPTS
 Approved by the Library of Congress and the American Library
 Association
 Tables compiled and edited by Randall K Barry
 Network Development and MARC Standards Office
 Library of Congress Washington 1991

Again it was necessary to delete the accent marks this time
accents which were recommended to be placed over the roman
characters The Greek poems are set off by angle brackets

Single Greek words embedded in roman text have also been
transliterated as described above and are identified by
double angle brackets eg eulikrines

SPELLING

I have made no spelling corrections whatsoever In the poems
the spelling is very inconsistent with several different versions
of a word being used in different places

OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE TEXT

In a few places the capital V and I characters were used
where we would use a capital U of J instead These have not
been changed For example Vnlese Iuvenal Where the capitals
in the original text were used to highlight the first word of
a poem V was changed to v for example OVR became Ovr

The copy of the book which I worked from had been rebound on
several occasions It is possible that the Table of Contents
was originally placed after the introduction

CHANGES TO THE TEXT

Symbols for British currency are changed to pounds shillings
and pence

In several places the word the appears with an accent mark over
the e The accent is in the form of a horizontal line above
the letter This word has been rendered as thee Similarly
whe with an accent over the e is rendered as whee
