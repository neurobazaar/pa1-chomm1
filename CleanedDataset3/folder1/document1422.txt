GOING INTO SOCIETY


At one period of its reverses the House fell into the occupation of a
Showman He was found registered as its occupier on the parish books of
the time when he rented the House and there was therefore no need of any
clue to his name But he himself was less easy to be found for he had
led a wandering life and settled people had lost sight of him and
people who plumed themselves on being respectable were shy of admitting
that they had ever known anything of him At last among the marsh lands
near the rivers level that lie about Deptford and the neighbouring
marketgardens a Grizzled Personage in velveteen with a face so cut up
by varieties of weather that he looked as if he had been tattooed was
found smoking a pipe at the door of a wooden house on wheels The wooden
house was laid up in ordinary for the winter near the mouth of a muddy
creek and everything near it the foggy river the misty marshes and
the steaming marketgardens smoked in company with the grizzled man In
the midst of this smoking party the funnelchimney of the wooden house
on wheels was not remiss but took its pipe with the rest in a
companionable manner

On being asked if it were he who had once rented the House to Let
Grizzled Velveteen looked surprised and said yes Then his name was
Magsman That was it Toby Magsmanwhich lawfully christened Robert
but called in the line from a infant Toby There was nothing agin Toby
Magsman he believed If there was suspicion of suchmention it

There was no suspicion of such he might rest assured But some
inquiries were making about that House and would he object to say why he
left it

Not at all why should he He left it along of a Dwarf

Along of a Dwarf

Mr Magsman repeated deliberately and emphatically Along of a Dwarf

Might it be compatible with Mr Magsmans inclination and convenience to
enter as a favour into a few particulars

Mr Magsman entered into the following particulars

It was a long time ago to begin withafore lotteries and a deal more
was done away with Mr Magsman was looking about for a good pitch and
he see that house and he says to himself Ill have you if youre to
be had If moneyll get you Ill have you

The neighbours cut up rough and made complaints but Mr Magsman dont
know what they _would_ have had It was a lovely thing First of all
there was the canvass representin the picter of the Giant in Spanish
trunks and a ruff who was himself half the heighth of the house and was
run up with a line and pulley to a pole on the roof so that his Ed was
coeval with the parapet Then there was the canvass representin the
picter of the Albina lady showing her white air to the Army and Navy in
correct uniform Then there was the canvass representin the picter of
the Wild Indian a scalpin a member of some foreign nation Then there
was the canvass representin the picter of a child of a British Planter
seized by two Boa Constrictorsnot that _we_ never had no child nor no
Constrictors neither Similarly there was the canvass representin the
picter of the Wild Ass of the Prairiesnot that _we_ never had no wild
asses nor wouldnt have had em at a gift Last there was the canvass
representin the picter of the Dwarf and like him too considerin with
George the Fourth in such a state of astonishment at him as His Majesty
couldnt with his utmost politeness and stoutness express The front of
the House was so covered with canvasses that there wasnt a spark of
daylight ever visible on that side MAGSMANS AMUSEMENTS fifteen foot
long by two foot high ran over the front door and parlour winders The
passage was a Arbour of green baize and gardenstuff A barrelorgan
performed there unceasing And as to respectabilityif threepence
aint respectable what is

But the Dwarf is the principal article at present and he was worth the
money He was wrote up as MAJOR TPSCHOFFKI OF THE IMPERIAL BULGRADERIAN
BRIGADE Nobody couldnt pronounce the name and it never was intended
anybody should The public always turned it as a regular rule into
Chopski In the line he was called Chops partly on that account and
partly because his real name if he ever had any real name which was
very dubious was Stakes

He was a uncommon small man he really was Certainly not so small as he
was made out to be but where _is_ your Dwarf as is He was a most
uncommon small man with a most uncommon large Ed and what he had inside
that Ed nobody ever knowed but himself even supposin himself to have
ever took stock of it which it would have been a stiff job for even him
to do

The kindest little man as never growed Spirited but not proud When
he travelled with the Spotted Babythough he knowed himself to be a
natral Dwarf and knowed the Babys spots to be put upon him artificial
he nursed that Baby like a mother You never heerd him give a illname
to a Giant He _did_ allow himself to break out into strong language
respectin the Fat Lady from Norfolk but that was an affair of the art
and when a mans art has been trifled with by a lady and the preference
giv to a Indian he aint master of his actions

He was always in love of course every human natral phenomenon is And
he was always in love with a large woman I never knowed the Dwarf as
could be got to love a small one Which helps to keep em the
Curiosities they are

One singler idea he had in that Ed of his which must have meant
something or it wouldnt have been there It was always his opinion
that he was entitled to property He never would put his name to
anything He had been taught to write by the young man without arms
who got his living with his toes quite a writing master _he_ was and
taught scores in the line but Chops would have starved to death afore
hed have gained a bit of bread by putting his hand to a paper This is
the more curious to bear in mind because HE had no property nor hope of
property except his house and a sarser When I say his house I mean
the box painted and got up outside like a reglar sixroomer that he
used to creep into with a diamond ring or quite as good to look at on
his forefinger and ring a little bell out of what the Public believed to
be the Drawingroom winder And when I say a sarser I mean a Chaney
sarser in which he made a collection for himself at the end of every
Entertainment His cue for that he took from me Ladies and gentlemen
the little man will now walk three times round the Cairawan and retire
behind the curtain When he said anything important in private life
he mostly wound it up with this form of words and they was generally the
last thing he said to me at night afore he went to bed

He had what I consider a fine minda poetic mind His ideas respectin
his property never come upon him so strong as when he sat upon a barrel
organ and had the handle turned Arter the wibration had run through him
a little time he would screech out Toby I feel my property
cominggrind away Im counting my guineas by thousands Tobygrind
away Toby I shall be a man of fortun I feel the Mint a jingling in
me Toby and Im swelling out into the Bank of England Such is the
influence of music on a poetic mind Not that he was partial to any
other music but a barrelorgan on the contrary hated it

He had a kind of a everlasting grudge agin the Public which is a thing
you may notice in many phenomenons that get their living out of it What
riled him most in the nater of his occupation was that it kep him out of
Society He was continiwally saying Toby my ambition is to go into
Society The curse of my position towards the Public is that it keeps
me hout of Society This dont signify to a low beast of a Indian he
ant formed for Society This dont signify to a Spotted Baby _he_ ant
formed for SocietyI am

Nobody never could make out what Chops done with his money He had a
good salary down on the drum every Saturday as the day came round
besides having the run of his teethand he was a Woodpecker to eatbut
all Dwarfs are The sarser was a little income bringing him in so many
halfpence that hed carry em for a week together tied up in a pocket
handkercher And yet he never had money And it couldnt be the Fat
Lady from Norfolk as was once supposed because it stands to reason that
when you have a animosity towards a Indian which makes you grind your
teeth at him to his face and which can hardly hold you from Goosing him
audible when hes going through his WarDanceit stands to reason you
wouldnt under them circumstances deprive yourself to support that
Indian in the lap of luxury

Most unexpected the mystery come out one day at Egham Races The Public
was shy of bein pulled in and Chops was ringin his little bell out of
his drawingroom winder and was snarlin to me over his shoulder as he
kneeled down with his legs out at the backdoorfor he couldnt be
shoved into his house without kneeling down and the premises wouldnt
accommodate his legswas snarlin Heres a precious Public for you why
the Devil dont they tumble up when a man in the crowd holds up a
carrierpigeon and cries out If theres any person here as has got a
ticket the Lotterys just drawed and the number as has come up for the
great prize is three seven fortytwo Three seven fortytwo I was
givin the man to the Furies myself for calling off the Publics
attentionfor the Public will turn away at any time to look at
anything in preference to the thing showed em and if you doubt it get
em together for any indiwidual purpose on the face of the earth and
send only two people in late and see if the whole company ant far more
interested in takin particular notice of them two than of youI say I
wasnt best pleased with the man for callin out and wasnt blessin him
in my own mind when I see Chopss little bell fly out of winder at a old
lady and he gets up and kicks his box over exposin the whole secret
and he catches hold of the calves of my legs and he says to me Carry me
into the wan Toby and throw a pail of water over me or Im a dead man
for Ive come into my property

Twelve thousand odd hundred pound was Chopss winnins He had bought a
halfticket for the twentyfive thousand prize and it had come up The
first use he made of his property was to offer to fight the Wild Indian
for five hundred pound a side him with a poisoned darninneedle and the
Indian with a club but the Indian being in want of backers to that
amount it went no further

Arter he had been mad for a weekin a state of mind in short in which
if I had let him sit on the organ for only two minutes I believe he
would have bustbut we kep the organ from himMr Chops come round and
behaved liberal and beautiful to all He then sent for a young man he
knowed as had a wery genteel appearance and was a Bonnet at a gaming
booth most respectable brought up father havin been imminent in the
livery stable line but unfortnate in a commercial crisis through
paintin a old gray gingerbay and sellin him with a Pedigree and Mr
Chops said to this Bonnet who said his name was Normandy which it
wasnt

Normandy Im a goin into Society Will you go with me

Says Normandy Do I understand you Mr Chops to hintimate that the
ole of the expenses of that move will be borne by yourself

Correct says Mr Chops And you shall have a Princely allowance
too

The Bonnet lifted Mr Chops upon a chair to shake hands with him and
replied in poetry with his eyes seemingly full of tears

 My boat is on the shore
 And my bark is on the sea
 And I do not ask for more
 But Ill Goalong with thee

They went into Society in a chay and four grays with silk jackets They
took lodgings in Pall Mall London and they blazed away

In consequence of a note that was brought to Bartlemy Fair in the autumn
of next year by a servant most wonderful got up in milkwhite cords and
tops I cleaned myself and went to Pall Mall one evening appinted The
gentlemen was at their wine arter dinner and Mr Chopss eyes was more
fixed in that Ed of his than I thought good for him There was three of
em in company I mean and I knowed the third well When last met he
had on a white Roman shirt and a bishops mitre covered with leopard
skin and played the clarionet all wrong in a band at a Wild Beast Show

This gent took on not to know me and Mr Chops said Gentlemen this is
a old friend of former days and Normandy looked at me through a eye
glass and said Magsman glad to see youwhich Ill take my oath he
wasnt Mr Chops to git him convenient to the table had his chair on
a throne much of the form of George the Fourths in the canvass but he
hardly appeared to me to be King there in any other pint of view for his
two gentlemen ordered about like Emperors They was all dressed like May
DaygorgeousAnd as to Wine they swam in all sorts

I made the round of the bottles first separate to say I had done it
and then mixed em all together to say I had done it and then tried
two of em as halfandhalf and then tother two Altogether I passed
a pleasin evenin but with a tendency to feel muddled until I considered
it good manners to get up and say Mr Chops the best of friends must
part I thank you for the wariety of foreign drains you have stood so
ansome I looks towards you in red wine and I takes my leave Mr
Chops replied If youll just hitch me out of this over your right arm
Magsman and carry me downstairs Ill see you out I said I couldnt
think of such a thing but he would have it so I lifted him off his
throne He smelt strong of Maideary and I couldnt help thinking as I
carried him down that it was like carrying a large bottle full of wine
with a rayther ugly stopper a good deal out of proportion

When I set him on the doormat in the hall he kep me close to him by
holding on to my coatcollar and he whispers

I aint appy Magsman

Whats on your mind Mr Chops

They dont use me well They ant grateful to me They puts me on the
mantelpiece when I wont have in more Champagnewine and they locks me
in the sideboard when I wont give up my property

Get rid of em Mr Chops

I cant Were in Society together and what would Society say

Come out of Society says I

I cant You dont know what youre talking about When you have once
gone into Society you mustnt come out of it

Then if youll excuse the freedom Mr Chops were my remark shaking
my head grave I think its a pity you ever went in

Mr Chops shook that deep Ed of his to a surprisin extent and slapped
it half a dozen times with his hand and with more Wice than I thought
were in him Then he says Youre a good fellow but you dont
understand Goodnight go along Magsman the little man will now walk
three times round the Cairawan and retire behind the curtain The last
I see of him on that occasion was his tryin on the extremest werge of
insensibility to climb up the stairs one by one with his hands and
knees Theyd have been much too steep for him if he had been sober
but he wouldnt be helped

It warnt long after that that I read in the newspaper of Mr Chopss
being presented at court It was printed It will be recollectedand
Ive noticed in my life that it is sure to be printed that it _will_ be
recollected whenever it wontthat Mr Chops is the individual of
small stature whose brilliant success in the last State Lottery
attracted so much attention Well I says to myself Such is Life He
has been and done it in earnest at last He has astonished George the
Fourth

On account of which I had that canvass newpainted him with a bag of
money in his hand a presentin it to George the Fourth and a lady in
Ostrich Feathers fallin in love with him in a bagwig sword and buckles
correct

I took the House as is the subject of present inquiriesthough not the
honour of bein acquaintedand I run Magsmans Amusements in it thirteen
monthssometimes one thing sometimes another sometimes nothin
particular but always all the canvasses outside One night when we had
played the last company out which was a shy company through its raining
Heavens hard I was takin a pipe in the one pair back along with the
young man with the toes which I had taken on for a month though he
never drawedexcept on paper and I heard a kickin at the street door
Halloa I says to the young man whats up He rubs his eyebrows
with his toes and he says I cant imagine Mr Magsmanwhich he
never could imagine nothin and was monotonous company

The noise not leavin off I laid down my pipe and I took up a candle
and I went down and opened the door I looked out into the street but
nothin could I see and nothin was I aware of until I turned round
quick because some creetur run between my legs into the passage There
was Mr Chops

Magsman he says take me on the old terms and youve got me if
its done say done

I was all of a maze but I said Done sir

Done to your done and double done says he Have you got a bit of
supper in the house

Bearin in mind them sparklin warieties of foreign drains as wed guzzled
away at in Pall Mall I was ashamed to offer him cold sassages and gin
andwater but he took em both and took em free havin a chair for his
table and sittin down at it on a stool like hold times I all of a
maze all the while

It was arter he had made a clean sweep of the sassages beef and to the
best of my calculations two pound and a quarter that the wisdom as was
in that little man began to come out of him like prespiration

Magsman he says look upon me You see afore you One as has both
gone into Society and come out

O You _are_ out of it Mr Chops How did you get out sir

SOLD OUT says he You never saw the like of the wisdom as his Ed
expressed when he made use of them two words

My friend Magsman Ill impart to you a discovery Ive made Its
wallable its cost twelve thousand five hundred pound it may do you
good in lifeThe secret of this matter is that it aint so much that a
person goes into Society as that Society goes into a person

Not exactly keepin up with his meanin I shook my head put on a deep
look and said Youre right there Mr Chops

Magsman he says twitchin me by the leg Society has gone into me to
the tune of every penny of my property

I felt that I went pale and though natrally a bold speaker I couldnt
hardly say Wheres Normandy

Bolted With the plate said Mr Chops

And tother one meaning him as formerly wore the bishops mitre

Bolted With the jewels said Mr Chops

I sat down and looked at him and he stood up and looked at me

Magsman he says and he seemed to myself to get wiser as he got
hoarser Society taken in the lump is all dwarfs At the court of St
Jamess they was all a doing my old businessall a goin three times
round the Cairawan in the hold courtsuits and properties Elsewheres
they was most of em ringin their little bells out of makebelieves
Everywheres the sarser was a goin round Magsman the sarser is the
uniwersal Institution

I perceived you understand that he was soured by his misfortunes and I
felt for Mr Chops

As to Fat Ladies he says giving his head a tremendious one agin the
wall theres lots of _them_ in Society and worse than the original
_Hers_ was a outrage upon Tastesimply a outrage upon Tasteawakenin
contemptcarryin its own punishment in the form of a Indian Here he
giv himself another tremendious one But _theirs_ Magsman _theirs_ is
mercenary outrages Lay in Cashmeer shawls buy bracelets strew em and
a lot of andsome fans and things about your rooms let it be known that
you give away like water to all as come to admire and the Fat Ladies
that dont exhibit for so much down upon the drum will come from all the
pints of the compass to flock about you whatever you are Theyll drill
holes in your art Magsman like a Cullender And when youve no more
left to give theyll laugh at you to your face and leave you to have
your bones picked dry by Wulturs like the dead Wild Ass of the Prairies
that you deserve to be Here he giv himself the most tremendious one of
all and dropped

I thought he was gone His Ed was so heavy and he knocked it so hard
and he fell so stoney and the sassagerial disturbance in him must have
been so immense that I thought he was gone But he soon come round
with care and he sat up on the floor and he said to me with wisdom
comin out of his eyes if ever it come

Magsman The most material difference between the two states of
existence through which your unhappy friend has passed he reached out
his poor little hand and his tears dropped down on the moustachio which
it was a credit to him to have done his best to grow but it is not in
mortals to command successthe difference this When I was out of
Society I was paid light for being seen When I went into Society I
paid heavy for being seen I prefer the former even if I wasnt forced
upon it Give me out through the trumpet in the hold way tomorrow

Arter that he slid into the line again as easy as if he had been iled
all over But the organ was kep from him and no allusions was ever
made when a company was in to his property He got wiser every day
his views of Society and the Public was luminous bewilderin awful and
his Ed got bigger and bigger as his Wisdom expanded it

He took well and pulled em in most excellent for nine weeks At the
expiration of that period when his Ed was a sight he expressed one
evenin the last Company havin been turned out and the door shut a wish
to have a little music

Mr Chops I said I never dropped the Mr with him the world might
do it but not me Mr Chops are you sure as you are in a state of
mind and body to sit upon the organ

His answer was this Toby when next met with on the tramp I forgive
her and the Indian And I am

It was with fear and trembling that I began to turn the handle but he
sat like a lamb I will be my belief to my dying day that I see his Ed
expand as he sat you may therefore judge how great his thoughts was He
sat out all the changes and then he come off

Toby he says with a quiet smile the little man will now walk three
times round the Cairawan and retire behind the curtain

When we called him in the morning we found him gone into a much better
Society than mine or Pall Malls I giv Mr Chops as comfortable a
funeral as lay in my power followed myself as Chief and had the George
the Fourth canvass carried first in the form of a banner But the
House was so dismal arterwards that I giv it up and took to the Wan
again

    

I dont triumph said Jarber folding up the second manuscript and
looking hard at Trottle I dont triumph over this worthy creature I
merely ask him if he is satisfied now

How can he be anything else I said answering for Trottle who sat
obstinately silent This time Jarber you have not only read us a
delightfully amusing story but you have also answered the question about
the House Of course it stands empty now Who would think of taking it
after it had been turned into a caravan I looked at Trottle as I said
those last words and Jarber waved his hand indulgently in the same
direction

Let this excellent person speak said Jarber You were about to say
my good man

I only wished to ask sir said Trottle doggedly if you could kindly
oblige me with a date or two in connection with that last story

A date repeated Jarber What does the man want with dates

I should be glad to know with great respect persisted Trottle if
the person named Magsman was the last tenant who lived in the House Its
my opinionif I may be excused for giving itthat he most decidedly was
not

With those words Trottle made a low bow and quietly left the room

There is no denying that Jarber when we were left together looked sadly
discomposed He had evidently forgotten to inquire about dates and in
spite of his magnificent talk about his series of discoveries it was
quite as plain that the two stories he had just read had really and
truly exhausted his present stock I thought myself bound in common
gratitude to help him out of his embarrassment by a timely suggestion
So I proposed that he should come to tea again on the next Monday
evening the thirteenth and should make such inquiries in the meantime
as might enable him to dispose triumphantly of Trottles objection

He gallantly kissed my hand made a neat little speech of acknowledgment
and took his leave For the rest of the week I would not encourage
Trottle by allowing him to refer to the House at all I suspected he was
making his own inquiries about dates but I put no questions to him

On Monday evening the thirteenth that dear unfortunate Jarber came
punctual to the appointed time He looked so terribly harassed that he
was really quite a spectacle of feebleness and fatigue I saw at a
glance that the question of dates had gone against him that Mr Magsman
had not been the last tenant of the House and that the reason of its
emptiness was still to seek

What I have gone through said Jarber words are not eloquent enough
to tell O Sophonisba I have begun another series of discoveries
Accept the last two as stories laid on your shrine and wait to blame me
for leaving your curiosity unappeased until you have heard Number
Three

Number Three looked like a very short manuscript and I said as much
Jarber explained to me that we were to have some poetry this time In
the course of his investigations he had stepped into the Circulating
Library to seek for information on the one important subject All the
Librarypeople knew about the House was that a female relative of the
last tenant as they believed had just after that tenant left sent a
little manuscript poem to them which she described as referring to events
that had actually passed in the House and which she wanted the
proprietor of the Library to publish She had written no address on her
letter and the proprietor had kept the manuscript ready to be given back
to her the publishing of poems not being in his line when she might
call for it She had never called for it and the poem had been lent to
Jarber at his express request to read to me

Before he began I rang the bell for Trottle being determined to have
him present at the new reading as a wholesome check on his obstinacy To
my surprise Peggy answered the bell and told me that Trottle had
stepped out without saying where I instantly felt the strongest
possible conviction that he was at his old tricks and that his stepping
out in the evening without leave meantPhilandering

Controlling myself on my visitors account I dismissed Peggy stifled my
indignation and prepared as politely as might be to listen to Jarber

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
