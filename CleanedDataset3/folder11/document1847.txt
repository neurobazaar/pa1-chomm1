SONGS MERRY AND SAD




The Bride



 The little white bride is left alone
 With him her lord the guests have gone
 The festal hall is dim
 No jesting now nor answering mirth
 The hush of sleep falls on the earth
 And leaves her here with him

 Why should there be O little white bride
 When the world has left you by his side
 A tear to brim your eyes
 Some old loveface that comes again
 Some old lovemoment sweet with pain
 Of passionate memories

 Does your heart yearn back with last regret
 For the maiden meads of mignonette
 And the fairyhaunted wood
 That you had not withheld from love
 A little while the freedom of
 Your happy maidenhood

 Or is it but a nameless fear
 A wordless joy that calls the tear
 In dumb appeal to rise
 When looking on him where he stands
 You yield up all into his hands
 Pleading into his eyes

 For days that laugh or nights that weep
 You two strike oars across the deep
 With lifes tide at the brim
 And all times beauty all loves grace
 Beams little bride upon your face
 Here looking up at him




Oh Ask Me Not



 Love should I set my heart upon a crown
 Squander my years and gain it
 What recompense of pleasure could I own
 For youths red drops would stain it

 Much have I thought on what our lives may mean
 And what their best endeavor
 Seeing we may not come again to glean
 But losing lose forever

 Seeing how zealots making choice of pain
 From home and country parted
 Have thought it life to leave their fellows slain
 Their women brokenhearted

 How teasing truth a thousand faces claims
 As in a broken mirror
 And what a father died for in the flames
 His own son scorns as error

 How even they whose hearts were sweet with song
 Must quaff oblivions potion
 And soon or late their sails be lost along
 The allsurrounding ocean

 Oh ask me not the haven of our ships
 Nor what flag floats above you
 I hold you close I kiss your sweet sweet lips
 And love you love you love you




Isabel



 When first I stood before you
 Isabel
 I stood there to adore you
 In your spell
 For all that grace composes
 And all that beauty knows is
 Your face above the roses
 Isabel

 You knew the charm of flowers
 Isabel
 Which like incarnate hours
 Rose and fell
 At your bosom glowed and gloried
 White and pale and pink and florid
 And you touched them with your forehead
 Isabel

 Amid the jest and laughter
 Isabel
 I saw you and thereafter
 Ill or well
 There was nothing else worth seeing
 Worth following or fleeing
 And no reason else for being
 Isabel




To 



 Some time far hence when Autumn sheds
 Her frost upon your hair
 And you together sit at dusk
 May I come to you there
 And lightly will our hearts turn back
 To this then distant day
 When while the world was clad in flowers
 You two were wed in May

 When we shall sit about your board
 Three old friends met again
 Joy will be with us but not much
 Of jest and laughter then
 For Autumns large content and calm
 Like heavens own smile will bless
 The harvest of your happy lives
 With store of happiness

 May you who flankt about with flowers
 Will plight your faith today
 Hold evermore enthroned the love
 Which you have crowned in May
 And Time will sleep upon his scythe
 The swallow rest his wing
 Seeing that you at autumntide
 Still clasp the hands of spring




To Melvin Gardner Suicide



 A flight of doves with wanton wings
 Flash white against the sky
 In the leafy copse an oriole sings
 And a robin sings hard by
 Sun and shadow are out on the hills
 The swallow has followed the daffodils
 In leaf and blade life throbs and thrills
 Through the wild warm heart of May

 To have seen the sun come back to have seen
 Children again at play
 To have heard the thrush where the woods are green
 Welcome the newborn day
 To have felt the soft grass cool to the feet
 To have smelt earths incense heavenly sweet
 To have shared the laughter along the street
 And then to have died in May

 A thousand roses will blossom red
 A thousand hearts be gay
 For the summer lingers just ahead
 And June is on her way
 The bee must bestir him to fill his cells
 The moon and the stars will weave new spells
 Of love and the music of marriage bells
 And oh to be dead in May




Away Down Home



 T will not be long before they hear
 The bullbat on the hill
 And in the valley through the dusk
 The pastoral whippoorwill
 A few more friendly suns will call
 The bluets through the loam
 And star the lanes with buttercups
 Away down home

 Kneedeep from reedy places
 Will sing the river frogs
 The terrapins will sun themselves
 On all the jutting logs
 The anglers cautious oar will leave
 A trail of drifting foam
 Along the shady currents
 Away down home

 The mockingbird will feel again
 The glory of his wings
 And wanton through the balmy air
 And sunshine while he sings
 With a new cadence in his call
 The glintwingd crow will roam
 From field to newlyfurrowed field
 Away down home

 When dogwood blossoms mingle
 With the maples modest red
 And sweet arbutus wakes at last
 From out her winters bed
 T would not seem strange at all to meet
 A dryad or a gnome
 Or Pan or Psyche in the woods
 Away down home

 Then come with me thou weary heart
 Forget thy brooding ills
 Since God has come to walk among
 His valleys and his hills
 The mart will never miss thee
 Nor the scholars dusty tome
 And the Mother waits to bless thee
 Away down home




For Janes Birthday



 If fate had held a careless knife
 And clipped one line that drew
 Of all the myriad lines of life
 From Eden up to you
 If in the wars and wastes of time
 One sire had met the sword
 One mother died before her prime
 Or wed some other lord

 Or had some other age been blest
 Long past or yet to be
 And you had been the worlds sweet guest
 Before or after me
 I wonder how this rose would seem
 Or yonder hillside cot
 For dear I cannot even dream
 A world where you are not

 Thus heaven forfends that I shall drink
 The gall that might have been
 If aught had broken a single link
 Along the lists of men
 And heaven forgives me whom it loves
 For feigning such distress
 My heart is happiest when it proves
 Its depth of happiness

 Enough to see you where you are
 Radiant with maiden mirth
 To bless whatever blessed star
 Presided oer your birth
 That on this immemorial morn
 When heaven was bending low
 The gods were kind and you were born
 Twenty sweet years ago




A Secret



 A little baby went to sleep
 One night in his white bed
 And the moon came by to take a peep
 At the little baby head

 A wind as wandering winds will do
 Brought to the baby there
 Sweet smells from some quaint flower that grew
 Out on some hill somewhere

 And wind and flower and pale moonbeam
 About the babys bed
 Stirred and woke the funniest dream
 In the little sleepy head

 He thought he was all sorts of things
 From a lion to a cat
 Sometimes he thought he flew on wings
 Or fell and fell so that

 When morning broke he was right glad
 But much surprised to see
 Himself a soft pink little lad
 Just like he used to be

 I would not give this story fame
 If there were room to doubt it
 But when he learned to talk he came
 And told me all about it




The Old Bad Woman



 The Old Bad Woman was coming along
 Busily humming a sort of song

 You could barely see below her bonnet
 Her chin where her long nose rested on it

 One tooth thrust out on her lower lip
 And she held one hand upon her hip

 Then we went to thinking mighty fast
 For we knew our time had come at last

 For what we had done and didnt do
 The Old Bad Woman would put us through

 If you cried enough to fill your hat
 She wouldnt care she was used to that

 Of the jam we had eaten she would know
 How we ran barefooted in the snow

 How we cried when they made us take our bath
 How we tied the grass across the path

 How we bound together the cat and cur
 We couldnt deny these things to her

 She pulled her nose up off her chin
 And blinked at us with an awful grin

 And we almost died becaze and because
 Her bony fingers looked like claws

 When she came on up to where we were
 How could we be polite to her

 You neednt guess how she put us through
 If you are bad shell visit you

 And when she leaves and hobbles off
 Youll think that she has done enough

 For the Old Bad Woman will and can
 Be just as bad as the Old Bad Man




Valentine



 This is the time for birds to mate
 Today the dove
 Will mark the ancient amorous date
 With moans of love
 The crow will change his call to prate
 His hopes thereof

 The starling will display the red
 That lights his wings
 The wren will know the sweet things said
 By him who swings
 And ducks and dips his crested head
 And sings and sings

 They are obedient to their blood
 Nor ask a sign
 Save buoyant air and swelling bud
 At hands divine
 But choose each in the barren wood
 His valentine

 In cautions maze they never wait
 Until they die
 They flock the seasons open gate
 Ere time steals by
 Love shall we see and imitate
 You love and I




A Photograph



 When in this room I turn in pondering pace
 And find thine eyes upon me where I stand
 Led on as by Enemos silken strand
 I come and gaze and gaze upon thy face

 Framed round by silence poised on pearlwhite grace
 Of curving throat too sweet for beaded band
 It seems as if some wizards magic wand
 Had wrought thee for the love of all the race

 Dear face that will not turn about to see
 The tulips glorying in the casement sun
 Or other days the drizzled raindrops run

 Down the damp walls but follow only me
 Would that Pygmalions goddess might be won
 To change this lifeless image into thee




Jesse Covington



 If I have had some merry times
 In roaming up and down the earth
 Have made some happyhearted rhymes
 And had my brimming share of mirth
 And if this song should live in fame
 When my brief day is dead and gone
 Let it recall with mine the name
 Of old man Jesse Covington

 Let it recall his waggish heart
 Yekehey yekehey heydiddlediddle
 When while the firelogs fell apart
 He snatched the bow across his fiddle
 And looked on with his eyes half shut
 Which meant his soul was wild with fun
 At our mad capers through the hut
 Of old man Jesse Covington

 For all the thrilling tales he told
 For all the tunes the fiddle knew
 For all the glorious nights of old
 We boys and he have rollicked through
 For laughter all unknown to wealth
 That roared responsive to a pun
 A hale ripe age and ruddy health
 To old man Jesse Covington




An Idyl



 Upon a gnarly knotty limb
 That fought the currents crest
 Where shocks of reeds peeped oer the brim
 Wild wasps had glued their nest

 And in a sprawling cypress grot
 Sheltered and safe from flood
 Dirtdaubers each had chosen a spot
 To shape his house of mud

 In a warm crevice of the bark
 A basking scorpion clung
 With bright blue tail and redrimmed eyes
 And yellow twinkling tongue

 A lunging trout flashed in the sun
 To do some petty slaughter
 And set the spiders all arun
 On little stilts of water

 Toward noon upon the swamp there stole
 A deep cathedral hush
 Save where from sunsplocht bough and bole
 Sweet thrush replied to thrush

 An angler came to cast his fly
 Beneath a baffling tree
 I smiled when I had caught his eye
 And he smiled back at me

 When stretched beside a shady elm
 I watched the dozy heat
 Nature was moving in her realm
 For I could hear her feet




Home Songs



 The little loves and sorrows are my song
 The leafy lanes and birthsteads of my sires
 Where memory broods by winters evening fires
 Oer ofttold joys and ghosts of ancient wrong
 The little cares and carols that belong
 To homehearts and old rustic lutes and lyres
 And spreading acres where calmeyed desires
 Wake with the dawn unfevered fair and strong

 If words of mine might lull the bairn to sleep
 And tell the meaning in a mothers eyes
 Might counsel love and teach their eyes to weep
 Who oer their dead question unanswering skies
 More worth than legions in the dust of strife
 Time looking back at last should count my life




M W Ransom

 Died October 8 1904



 For him who in a hundred battles stood
 Scorning the cannons mouth
 Grimy with flame and red with foemans blood
 For thy sweet sake O South

 Who wise as brave yielded his conquered sword
 At a vain wars surcease
 And spoke thy champion still the statesmans word
 In the calm halls of peace

 Who pressed the ruddy wine to thy faint lips
 Where thy torn body lay
 And saw afar times white insailing ships
 Bringing a happier day

 Oh mourn for him dear land that gave him birth
 Bow low thy sorrowing head
 Let thy seared leaves fall silent on the earth
 Whereunder he lies dead

 In field and hall in valor and in grace
 In wisdoms livery
 Gentle and brave he moved with knightly pace
 A worthy son of thee




Protest



 Oh I am weary weary weary
 Of Pan and oaten quills
 And little songs that from the dictionary
 Learn lore of streams and hills
 Of studied laughter mocking what is merry
 And calculated thrills

 Are we grown old and past the time of singing
 Is ardor quenched in art
 Till art is but a formal figure bringing
 A moneymeasured heart
 Procrustean cut and with old echoes ringing
 Its bells about the mart

 The race moves on and leaves no wildernesses
 Where rugged voices cry
 It reads its prayer and with set phrase it blesses
 The souls of men who die
 And step by even step its rank progresses
 An army marshalled by

 If it be better so that Babel noises
 Losing all course and ken
 And grief that wails and gladness that rejoices
 Should never wake again
 To shock a world of modulated voices
 And mediocre men

 Then he is blest who wears the painted feather
 And may not turn about
 To dusks when muses romped the dewy heather
 In unrestricted rout
 And dawns when if the stars had sung together
 The sons of God would shout




Oblivion



 Green moss will creep
 Along the shady graves where we shall sleep

 Each year will bring
 Another brood of birds to nest and sing

 At dawn will go
 New ploughmen to the fields we used to know

 Night will call home
 The hunter from the hills we loved to roam

 She will not ask
 The milkmaid singing softly at her task

 Nor will she care
 To know if I were brave or you were fair

 No one will think
 What chalice life had offered us to drink

 When from our clay
 The sun comes back to kiss the snow away




Now



 Her brown hair knew no royal crest
 No gems nor jeweled charms
 No roses her bright cheek caressed
 No lilies kissed her arms
 In simple modest womanhood
 Clad as was meet in white
 The fairest flower of all she stood
 Amid the softest light

 It had been worth a perilous quest
 To see the court she drew
 My rose my gem my royal crest
 My lily moist with dew
 Worth heaven when with farewells from each
 The gay throng let us be
 To see her turn at last and reach
 Her white hands out to me




Tommy Smith



 When summers languor drugs my veins
 And fills with sleep the droning times
 Like sluggish dreams among my brains
 There runs the drollest sort of rhymes
 Idle as clouds that stray through heaven
 And vague as if they were a myth
 But in these rhymes is always given
 A health for old Bluebritches Smith

 Among my thoughts of what is good
 In olden times and distant lands
 Is that donothing neighborhood
 Where the old ciderhogshead stands
 To welcome with its brimming gourd
 The canny crowd of kin and kith
 Who meet about the bibulous board
 Of old Bluebritches Tommy Smith

 In years to come when stealthy change
 Hath stolen the ciderpress away
 And the gnarled orchards of the grange
 Have fallen before a slow decay
 Were I so cunning I would carve
 From some timescorning monolith
 A sculpture that should well preserve
 The fame of old Bluebritches Smith




Before Bedtime



 The cat sleeps in a chimney jam
 With ashes in her fur
 An Tige from on the yuther side
 He keeps his eye on her

 The jar o curds is on the hearth
 An Im the one to turn it
 Ill crawl in bed an go to sleep
 When maw begins to churn it

 Paw bends to read his almanax
 An study out the weather
 An bud has got a gourd o grease
 To ile his harness leather

 Sis looks an looks into the fire
 Halfsquintin through her lashes
 An I jis watch my tater where
 It shoots smoke through the ashes




If I Could Glimpse Him



 When in the Scorpion circles low
 The sun with fainter dreamier light
 And at a faroff hint of snow
 The giddy swallows take to flight
 And droning insects sadly know
 That cooler falls the autumn night

 When airs breathe drowsily and sweet
 Charming the woods to colors gay
 And distant pastures send the bleat
 Of hungry lambs at break of day
 Old Hermes wings grow on my feet
 And goodby home Im called away

 There on the hills should I behold
 Sitting upon an old gray stone
 That humps its back up through the mold
 And piping in a monotone
 Pan as he sat in days of old
 My joy would bid surprise begone

 Dear Pan Tis he that calls me out
 He lying in some hazel copse
 Where lazily he turns about
 And munches each nut as it drops
 Well pleased to see me swamped in doubt
 At sound of his muchchanging stops

 If I could glimpse him by the vine
 Where purple foxgrapes hang their store
 Id tell him in his leafy shrine
 How poets say he lives no more
 Hed laugh and pluck a muscadine
 And fall to piping as of yore




Attraction



 He who wills life wills its condition sweet
 Having made love its mother joy its quest
 That its perpetual sequence might not rest
 On reasons dictum cold and too discreet

 For reason moves with cautious careful feet
 Debating whether life or death were best
 And why pale pain not ruddy mirth is guest
 In many a heart which life hath set to beat

 But I will cast my fate with love and trust
 Her honeyed heart that guides the pollened bee
 And sets the happy wingseeds fluttering free

 And I will bless the law which saith Thou must
 And wet with sea or shod with weary dust
 Will follow back and back and back to thee




Loves Fashion



 Oh I can jest with Margaret
 And laugh a gay goodnight
 But when I take my Helens hand
 I dare not clasp it tight

 I dare not hold her dear white hand
 More than a quivering space
 And I should bless a breeze that blew
 Her hair into my face

 T is Margaret I call sweet names
 Helen is too too dear
 For me to stammer little words
 Of love into her ear

 So now goodnight fair Margaret
 And kiss me eer we part
 But one dumb touch of Helens hand
 And oh my heart my heart




Alcestis



 Not long the living weep above their dead
 And you will grieve Admetus but not long
 The winters silence in these desolate halls
 Will break with Aprils laughter on your lips
 The bees among the flowers the birds that mate
 The widowed year grown gaunt with memory
 And yearning toward the summers fruits will come
 With lotus comfort feeding all your veins
 The vining brier will crawl across my grave
 And you will woo another in my stead
 Those tender foolish names you called me by
 Your passionate kiss that clung unsatisfied
 The pressure of your hand when dark night hushed
 Lifes busy stir and left us two alone
 Will you remember or when dawn creeps in
 And you bend oer anothers pillowed head
 Seeing sleeps loosened hair about her face
 Until her low lovelaughter welcomes you
 Will you downgazing at her waking eyes
 Forget
 So have I loved you my Admetus
 I thank the cruel fates who clip my life
 To lengthen yours they tarry not for age
 To dim my eye and blanch my cheek but now
 Take me while my lips are sweet to you
 And youth hides yet amid this hair of mine
 Brown in the shadow golden in the light
 Bend down and kiss me dying for your sake
 Not gratefully but sadly loves farewell
 And if the flowering years oblivion
 Lend a new passion to thy life far down
 In the dim Stygian shadows wandering
 I will not know but still will cherish there
 Where no change comes thy love upon my lips




Reminiscence



 We sang old lovesongs on the way
 In sad and merry snatches
 Your fingers oer the strings astray
 Strumming the random catches

 And ever as the skiff plied on
 Among the trailing willows
 Trekking the darker deeps to shun
 The gleaming sandy shallows

 It seemed that we had ages gone
 In some far summer weather
 When this same faery moonlight shone
 Sung these same songs together

 And every grassy cape we passed
 And every reedy island
 Even the bankd cloud in the west
 That loomed a sombre highland

 And you with dewmist on your hair
 Crowned with a wreath of lilies
 Laughing like Lalage the fair
 And tendereyed like Phyllis

 I know not if t were here at home
 By some old wizards orders
 Or long ago in Crete or Rome
 Or fair Provencal borders

 But now as when a faint flame breaks
 From out its smouldering embers
 My heart stirs in its sleep and wakes
 And yet but halfremembers

 That you and I some other time
 Moved through this dream of glory
 Like lovers in an ancient rhyme
 A longforgotten story




Sonnet



 I would that love were subject unto law
 Upon his person I should lay distraint
 And force him thus to answer my complaint
 Which I in wellconsidered counts should draw
 Not free to fly he needs must seek some flaw
 To mar my pleading though his heart were faint
 Declare his counsel to me and acquaint
 Himself with maxim precedent and saw

 Ah I could win him with authorities
 If suing thus in such a sober court
 Could read him many an ancient rhymd report
 Of such sad cases tears would fill his eyes
 And he confess a judgment or resort
 To some wellpleasing terms of compromise




Lines



 To you dear mother heart whose hair is gray
 Above this page today
 Whose face though lined with many a smile and care
 Grows year by year more fair

 Be tenderest tribute set in perfect rhyme
 That haply passing time
 May cull and keep it for strange lips to pay
 When we have gone our way

 And to strange men weary of field and street
 Should this my song seem sweet
 Yours be the joy for all that made it so
 You know dear heart you know




An Easter Hymn



 The Sun has come again and fed
 The lilys lamp with light
 And raised from dust a rose rich red
 And a little starflower white
 He also guards the Pleiades
 And holds his planets true
 But wewe know not which of these
 The easier task to do

 But since from heaven he stoops to breathe
 A flower to balmy air
 Surely our lives are not beneath
 The kindness of his care
 And as he guides the blade that gropes
 Up from the barren sod
 So from the ashes of our hopes
 Will beauty grow toward God

 Whateer thy name O Soul of Life
 We know but that thou art
 Thou seest through all our waste of strife
 One groping human heart
 Weary of words and broken sight
 But moved with deep accord
 To worship where thy lilies light
 The altar of its Lord




A Christmas Hymn



 Near where the shepherds watched by night
 And heard the angels oer them
 The wise men saw the starry light
 Stand still at last before them
 No armored castle there to ward
 His precious life from danger
 But wrapped in common cloth our Lord
 Lay in a lowly manger
 No booming bells proclaimed his birth
 No armies marshalled by
 No iron thunders shook the earth
 No rockets clomb the sky
 The temples builded in his name
 Were shapeless granite then
 And all the choirs that sang his fame
 Were later breeds of men
 But while the world about him slept
 Nor cared that he was born
 One gentle face above him kept
 Its mother watch till morn
 And if his baby eyes could tell
 What grace and glory were
 No roar of gun no boom of bell
 Were worth the look of her
 Now praise to God that ere his grace
 Was scorned and he reviled
 He looked into his mothers face
 A little helpless child
 And praise to God that ere men strove
 About his tomb in war
 One loved him with a mothers love
 Nor knew a creed therefor




When I Go Home



 When I go home green green will glow the grass
 Whereon the flight of sun and cloud will pass
 Long lines of woodducks through the deepening gloam
 Will hold above the west as wrought on brass
 And fragrant furrows will have delved the loam
 When I go home

 When I go home the dogwood stars will dash
 The solemn woods above the bearded ash
 The yellowjasmine whence its vine hath clomb
 Will blaze the valleys with its golden flash
 And every orchard flaunt its polychrome
 When I go home

 When I go home and stroll about the farm
 The thicket and the barnyard will be warm
 Jess will be there and Nigger Bill and Tom
 On whom times chisel works no hint of harm
 And oh twill be a day to rest and roam
 When I go home




Odessa



 A horror of great darkness over them
 No cloud of fire to guide and cover them
 Beasts for the shambles tremulous with dread
 They crouch on alien soil among their dead

 Thy shield and thy exceeding great reward
 This was thine ancient covenant O Lord
 Which sealed with mirth these many thousand years
 Is black with blood and blotted out with tears

 Have these not toiled through Egypts burning sun
 And wept beside the streams of Babylon
 Led from thy wilderness of hill and glen
 Into a wider wilderness of men

 Life bore them ever less of gain than loss
 Before and since Golgothas piteous Cross
 And surely now their sorrow hath sufficed
 For all the hate that grew from love of Christ

 Thou great Godheart heed thou thy peoples cry
 Barebrowed and emptyhanded where they die
 Seasundered from wallgirt Jerusalem
 There being no sword that wills to succor them

 And Miriams song long hushed will rise to thee
 And all thy people lift their eyes to thee
 When for the darkness horror over them
 Thou comest a cloud of light to cover them




Trifles



 What shall I bring you sweet
 A posy prankt with every April hue
 The cloudwhite daisy violet skyblue
 Shot with the primrose sunshine through and through

 Or shall I bring you sweet
 Some ancient rhyme of lovers sore beset
 Whose joy is dead whose sadness lingers yet
 That you may read and sigh and soon forget

 What shall I bring you sweet
 Was ever trifle yet so held amiss
 As not to fill loves waiting heart with bliss
 And merit dalliance at a long long kiss




Sunburnt Boys



 Down on the Lumbee river
 Where the eddies ripple cool
 Your boat I know glides stealthily
 About some shady pool
 The summers heats have lulled asleep
 The fishhawks chattering noise
 And all the swamp lies hushed about
 You sunburnt boys

 You see the minnows waves that rock
 The cradled lily leaves
 From a far field some farmers song
 Singing among his sheaves
 Comes mellow to you where you sit
 Each man with boatmans poise
 There in the shimmering water lights
 You sunburnt boys

 I know your haunts each gnarly bole
 That guards the waterside
 Each tuft of flags and rushes where
 The river reptiles hide
 Each dimpling nook wherein the bass
 His eager life employs
 Until he diesthe captive of
 You sunburnt boys

 You will notwill yousoon forget
 When I was one of you
 Nor love me less that time has borne
 My craft to currents new
 Nor shall I ever cease to share
 Your hardships and your joys
 Robust roughspoken gentlehearted
 Sunburnt boys




Gray Days



 A soaking sedge
 A faded field a leafless hill and hedge

 Low clouds and rain
 And loneliness and languor worse than pain

 Mottled with moss
 Each gravestone holds to heaven a patient Cross

 Shrill streaks of light
 Two sycamores cleanlimbed funereal white

 And low between
 The sombre cedar and the ivy green

 Upon the stone
 Of each in turn who called this land his own

 The gray rain beats
 And wraps the wet world in its flying sheets

 And at my eaves
 A slow wind ghostlike comes and grieves and grieves




An Invalid



 I care not what his name for God may be
 Nor what his wisdom holds of heaven and hell
 The alphabet whereby he strives to spell
 His lines of life nor where he bends his knee
 Since with his grave before him he can see
 White Peace above it while the churchyard bell
 Poised in its tower poised now to boom his knell
 Seems but the waiting tongue of liberty

 For names and knowledge idle breed of breath
 And cant and creed the progeny of strife
 Thronging the safe companioned streets of life
 Shrink trembling from the cold clear eye of death
 And learn too late why dying lips can smile
 That goodness is the only creed worth while




A Caged MockingBird



 I pass a cobblers shop along the street
 And pause a moment at the doorstep where
 In natures medley piping cool and sweet
 The songs that thrill the swamps when spring is near
 Fly oer the fields at fullness of the year
 And twitter where the autumn hedges run
 Join all the months of music into one

 I shut my eyes the shy woodthrush is there
 And all the leaves hang still to catch his spell
 Wrens cheep among the bushes from somewhere
 A bluebirds tweedle passes oer the fell
 From rustling corn bobwhite his name doth tell
 And when the oriole sets his full heart free
 Barefooted boyhood comes again to me

 The visionbringer hangs upon a nail
 Before a dusty window looking dim
 On marts where trade goes hot with box and bale
 The sadeyed passers have no time for him
 His captor sits with beaded face and grim
 Plying a listless awl as in a dream
 Of pastures winding by a shady stream

 Gray bird what spirit bides with thee unseen
 For now when every songster finds his love
 And makes his nest where woods are deep and green
 Free as the winds thy song should mock the dove
 If I were thou my grief in moans should move
 At thinkingotherwhere by others art
 Charmed and forgetfulof mine own sweetheart

 But I who weep when fortune seems unkind
 To prison me within a space of walls
 When faroff grottoes hold my loves enshrined
 And every love is cruel when it calls
 Who sulk for hills and fernfledged waterfalls
 I blush to offer sorrow unto thee
 Master of fate scorner of destiny




Dawn



 The hills again reach skyward with a smile
 Again with waking life along its way
 The landscape marches westward mile on mile
 And time throbs white into another day

 Though eager life must wait on livelihood
 And all our hopes be tethered to the mart
 Lacking the eagles wild high freedom would
 That ours might be this day the eagles heart




Harvest



 Cows in the stall and sheep in the fold
 Clouds in the west deep crimson and gold
 A herons far flight to a roost somewhere
 The twitter of killdees keen in the air
 The noise of a wagon that jolts through the gloam
 On the last load home

 There are lights in the windows a blue spire of smoke
 Climbs from the grange grove of elm and oak
 The smell of the Earth where the night pours to her
 Its dewy libation is sweeter than myrrh
 And an incense to Toil is the smell of the loam
 On the last load home




Two Pictures



 One sits in soft light where the hearth is warm
 A halo like an angels on her hair
 She clasps a sleeping infant in her arm
 A holy presence hovers round her there
 And she for all her motherpains more fair
 Is happy seeing that all sweet thoughts that stir
 The hearts of men bear worship unto her

 Another wanders where the cold wind blows
 Wethaired with eyes that sting one like a knife
 Homeless forever at her bosom close
 She holds the purchase of her love and life
 Of motherhood unglorified as wife
 And bitterer than the worlds relentless scorn
 The knowing her child were happier never born

 Whence are the halo and the fiery shame
 That fashion thus a crown and curse of love
 Have roted words such power to bless and blame
 Ay men have stained a raven from many a dove
 And all the grace and all the grief hereof
 Are the two words which bore ones lips apart
 And which the other hoarded in her heart

 He who stooped down and wrote upon the sand
 The Godheart in him touched to tenderness
 Saw deep saw what we cannot understand
 We who draw near the shrine of one to bless
 The while we scourge anothers sore distress
 And judge like gods between the ill and good
 The glory and the guilt of womanhood




October



 The thought of old dear things is in thine eyes
 O month of memories
 Musing on days thine heart hath sorrow of
 Old joy dead hope dear love

 I see thee stand where all thy sisters meet
 To cast down at thy feet
 The garnered largess of the fruitful year
 And on thy cheek a tear

 Thy glory flames in every blade and leaf
 To blind the eyes of grief
 Thy vineyards and thine orchards bend with fruit
 That sorrow may be mute

 A hectic splendor lights thy days to sleep
 Ere the gray dusk may creep
 Sober and sad along thy dusty ways
 Like a lone nun who prays

 High and faintheard thy passing migrant calls
 Thy lazy lizard sprawls
 On his gray stone and many slow winds creep
 About thy hedge asleep

 The sun swings farther toward his love the south
 To kiss her glowing mouth
 And Death who steals among thy purpling bowers
 Is deeply hid in flowers

 Would that thy streams were Lethe and might flow
 Where lotus blossoms blow
 And all the sweets wherewith thy riches bless
 Might hold no bitterness

 Would in thy beauty we might all forget
 Dead days and old regret
 And through thy realm might fare us forth to roam
 Having no thought for home

 And yet I feel beneath thy queens attire
 Woven of blood and fire
 Beneath the golden glory of thy charm
 Thy mother heart beats warm

 And if mayhap a wandering child of thee
 Weary of land and sea
 Should turn him homeward from his dreamers quest
 To sob upon thy breast

 Thine arm would fold him tenderly to prove
 How thine eyes brimmed with love
 And thy dear hand with all a mothers care
 Would rest upon his hair




The Old Clock



 All day low clouds and slanting rain
 Have swept the woods and dimmed the plain
 Wet winds have swayed the birch and oak
 And caught and swirled away the smoke
 But all day long the wooden clock
 Went on Nicnoc nicnoc

 When deep at night I wake with fear
 And shudder in the dark to hear
 The roaring storms unguided strength
 Peace steals into my heart at length
 When calm amid the shout and shock
 I hear Nicnoc nicnoc

 And all the winter long t is I
 Who bless its sheer monotony
 Its scorn of days which cares no whit
 For time except to measure it
 The prosy dozy cosy clock
 Nicnoc nicnoc nicnoc




Tear Stains



 Tearmarks stain from page to page
 This book my fathers left to me
 So dull that nothing but its age
 Were worth its freight across the sea

 But tear stains When by whom and why
 Thus takes my fancy to its wings
 For grief is old and one may cry
 About so many things




A Prayer



 If many years should dim my inward sight
 Till stirred with no emotion
 I might stand gazing at the fall of night
 Across the gloaming ocean

 Till storm and sun and night vast with her stars
 Would seem an ofttold story
 And the old sorrow of heroic wars
 Be faded of its glory

 Till hearing while Junes roses blew their musk
 The noise of field and city
 The human struggle sinking tired at dusk
 I felt no thrill of pity

 Till dawn should come without her old desire
 And day brood oer her stages
 O let me die too frail for natures hire
 And rest a million ages




She Being Young



 The home of love is her blue eyes
 Wherein all joy all beauty lies
 More sweet than hopes of paradise
 She being young

 Speak of her with a misers praise
 She craves no golden speech her ways
 Wind through charmed nights and magic days
 She being young

 She is so far from pain and death
 So warm her cheek so sweet her breath
 Glad words are all the words she saith
 She being young

 Seeing her face it seems not far
 To Troys heroic field of war
 To Troy and all great things that are
 She being young




Paul Jones



 A century of silent suns
 Have set since he was laid on sleep
 And now they bear with booming guns
 And streaming banners oer the deep
 A withered skin and clammy hair
 Upon a frame of human bones
 Whose corse We neither know nor care
 Content to name it John Paul Jones

 His dust were as anothers dust
 His boneswhat boots it where they lie
 What matter where his sword is rust
 Or where now dark his eagle eye
 No foe need fear his arm again
 Nor love nor praise can make him whole
 But oer the farthest sons of men
 Will brood the glory of his soul

 Careless though cenotaph or tomb
 Shall tower his countrys monument
 Let banners float and cannon boom
 A millionthroated shout be spent
 Until his widowed sea shall laugh
 With sunlight in her mantling foam
 While to his tomb or cenotaph
 We bid our hero welcome home

 Twice exiled let his ashes rest
 At home afar or in the wave
 But keep his great heart with us lest
 Our nations greatness find its grave
 And while the vast deep listens by
 When armored wrong makes terms to right
 Keep on our lips his proud reply
 Sir I have but begun to fight




The Drudge



 Repose upon her soulless face
 Dig the grave and leave her
 But breathe a prayer that in his grace
 He who so loved this toiling race
 To endless rest receive her

 Oh can it be the gates ajar
 Wait not her humble quest
 Whose life was but a patient war
 Against the death that stalked from far
 With neither haste nor rest

 To whom were sun and moon and cloud
 The streamlets pebbly coil
 The transient Maybound feathered crowd
 The storms frank fury thunderbrowed
 But witness of her toil

 Whose weary feet knew not the bliss
 Of dance by jocund reed
 Who never dallied at a kiss
 If heaven refuses her life is
 A tragedy indeed




The Wife



 They locked him in a prison cell
 Murky and mean
 She kissed him there a wifes farewell
 The bars between
 And when she turned to go the crowd
 Thinking to see her shamed and bowed
 Saw her pass out as calm and proud
 As any queen

 She passed a kinsman on the street
 To whose sad eyes
 She made reply with smile as sweet
 As April skies
 To one who loved her once and knew
 The sorrow of her life she threw
 A gay word ere his tale was due
 Of sympathies

 She met a playmate whose red rose
 Had never a thorn
 Whom fortune guided when she chose
 Her marriage morn
 And smiling looked her in the eye
 But seeing the tears of sympathy
 Her smile died and she passed on by
 In quiet scorn

 They could not know how when by night
 The city slept
 A sleepless woman still and white
 The watches kept
 How her wifeloyal heart had borne
 The keen pain of a flowerless thorn
 How hot the tears that smiles and scorn
 Had held unwept




Vision



 The wintry sun was pale
 On hill and hedge
 The wind smote with its flail
 The seeded sedge
 High up above the world
 New taught to fly
 The withered leaves were hurled
 About the sky
 And there through death and dearth
 It went and came
 The Glory of the earth
 That hath no name

 I know not what it is
 I only know
 It quivers in the bliss
 Where roses blow
 That on the winters breath
 It broods in space
 And oer the face of death
 I see its face
 And start and stand between
 Delight and dole
 As though mine eyes had seen
 A living Soul

 And I have followed it
 As thou hast done
 Where April shadows flit
 Beneath the sun
 In dawn and dusk and star
 In joy and fear
 Have seen its glory far
 And felt it near
 And dared recall his name
 Who stood unshod
 Before a fireless flame
 And called it God




September



 I have not been among the woods
 Nor seen the milkweeds burst their hoods

 The downy thistleseeds take wing
 Nor the squirrel at his garnering

 And yet I know that up to God
 The mute month holds her goldenrod

 That clump and copse oerrun with vines
 Twinkle with clustered muscadines

 And in deserted churchyard places
 Dwarf apples smile with sunburnt faces

 I know how ere her green is shed
 The dogwood pranks herself with red

 How the pale dawn chilled through and through
 Comes drenched and draggled with her dew

 How all day long the sunlight seems
 As if it lit a land of dreams

 Till evening with her mist and cloud
 Begins to weave her royal shroud

 If yet as in old Homers land
 Gods walk with mortals hand in hand

 Somewhere today in this sweet weather
 Thinkest thou not they walk together




Barefooted



 The girls all like to see the bluets in the lane
 And the saucy johnnyjumpups in the meadow
 But we boys we want to see the dogwood blooms again
 Throwin a sort of summerlookin shadow
 For the very first mild mornin when the woods are white
 And we neednt even ask a soul about it
 We leave our shoes right where we pulled them off at night
 And barefooted once again we run and shout it
 You may take the country over
 When the bluebird turns a rover
 And the wind is soft and hazy
 And you feel a little lazy
 And the hunters quit the possums
 Its the time for dogwood blossoms

 We feel so light we wish there were more fences here
 Wed like to jump and jump them all together
 No sleds for us no guns nor even simmon beer
 No nothin but the blossoms and fair weather
 The meadow is a little sticky right at first
 But a few short days ll wipe away that trouble
 To feel so good and gay I wouldnt mind the worst
 That could be done by any field o stubble
 O all the trees are seemin sappy
 O all the folks are smilin happy
 And theres joy in every little bit of room
 But the happiest of them all
 At the Shanghai roosters call
 Are we barefoots when the dogwoods burst abloom




Pardon Time



 Give over now forbear The moonlight steeps
 In silver silence towered castlekeeps
 And cottage crofts where apples bend the bough
 Peace guards us round and many a tired heart sleeps
 Let me brush back the shadow from your brow
 Give over now

 On such a night how sweet how sweet is life
 Even to the insect piper with his fife
 And must your troubled face still bear the blight
 Of strength that runs itself to waste in strife
 For loves own heart should throb through all the light
 Of such a night




The Rattlesnake



 Coiled like a clod his eyes the home of hate
 Where rich the harvest bows he lies in wait
 Linking earths death and music mate with mate

 Is t lure or warning Those small bells may sing
 Like Ariel sirens poised on viewless wing
 To lead stark life where mailed death is king

 Else natures voice in that cold earthy thrill
 Bids good avoid the venomed fang of ill
 And life and death fight equal in her will




The Prisoner



 From pacing pacing without hope or quest
 He leaned against his windowbars to rest
 And smelt the breeze that crept up from the west

 It came with sundown noises from the moors
 Of milking time and loudvoiced rural chores
 Of lumbering wagons and of closing doors

 He caught a whiff of furrowed upland sweet
 And certain scents stole up across the street
 That told him fireflies winked among the wheat

 Over the dusk hill woke a new moons light
 Shadowed the woods and made the waters white
 And watched above the quiet tents of night

 Alas that the old Mother should not know
 How ached his heart to be entreated so
 Who heard her calling and who could not go




Sonnet



 Today was but a dead day in my hands
 Hour by hour did nothing more than pass
 Mere idle winds above the faded grass
 And I as though a captive held in bands
 Who seeing a pageant wonders much but stands
 Apart saw the sun blaze his course with brass
 And sink into his fabled sea of glass
 With glory of farewell to many lands

 Thou knowest thou who talliest life by days
 That I have suffered more than pain of toil
 Ah more than they whose wounds are soothed with oil
 And they who see new light on beaten ways
 The prisoner I who grasps his iron bars
 And stares out into depth on depth of stars




Folk Song



 When merry milkmaids to their cattle call
 At evenfall
 And voices range
 Loud through the gloam from grange to quiet grange

 Wild waifsongs from long distant lands and loves
 Like migrant doves
 Wake and give wing
 To passion dustdumb lips were wont to sing

 The new still holds the old moon in her arms
 The ancient charms
 Of dew and dusk
 Still lure her nomad odors from the musk

 And at each days millennial eclipse
 On new mens lips
 Some old song starts
 Made of the music of millennial hearts

 Whereto one listens as from long ago
 And learns to know
 That one days tears
 And love and life are as a thousand years

 And that some simple shepherd singing of
 His pain and love
 May haply find
 His heartsong speaks the heart of all his kind




97 The Fast Mail



 Where the rails converge to the station yard
 She stands one moment breathing hard

 And then with a snort and a clang of steel
 She settles her strength to the stubborn wheel

 And out through the tracks that lead astray
 Cautiously slowly she picks her way

 And gathers her muscle and guards her nerve
 When she swings her nose to the westward curve

 And takes the grade which slopes to the sky
 With a bound of speed and a conquering cry

 The hazy horizon is all she sees
 Nor cares for the meadows stirred with bees

 Nor the long straight stretches of silent land
 Nor the ploughman that shades his eye with his hand

 Nor the cots and hamlets that know no more
 Than a shriek and a flash and a flying roar

 But bearing her tidings she trembles and throbs
 And laughs in her throat and quivers and sobs

 And the fire in her heart is a red core of heat
 That drives like a passion through forest and street

 Till she sees the ships in their harbor at rest
 And sniffs at the trail to the end of her quest

 If I were the driver who handles her reins
 Up hill and down hill and over the plains

 To watch the slow mountains give back in the west
 To know the new reaches that wait every crest

 To hold when she swerves with a confident clutch
 And feel how she shivers and springs to the touch

 With the snow on her back and the sun in her face
 And nothing but time as a quarry to chase

 I should grip hard my teeth and look where she led
 And brace myself stooping and give her her head

 And urge her and soothe her and serve all her need
 And exult in the thunder and thrill of her speed




Sundown



 Hills wrapped in gray standing along the west
 Clouds dimly lighted gathering slowly
 The star of peace at watch above the crest
 Oh holy holy holy

 We know O Lord so little what is best
 Wingless we move so lowly
 But in thy calm allknowledge let us rest
 Oh holy holy holy




At Sea



 When the dim tall sails of the ships were in motion
 Ghostly and slow and silentshod
 We gazed where the dusk fled over the ocean
 A great gray hush like the shadow of God

 The sky dome cut with its compass in sunder
 A circle of sea from the darkened land
 A circle of tremulous waste and wonder
 Oer which one groped with a childish hand

 The true stars came to their stations in heaven
 The false stars shivered deep down in the sea
 And the white crests went like monsters driven
 By winds that never would let them be

 And there where the elements mingled and muttered
 We stood each man with a lone dumb heart
 Full of the vastness that never was uttered
 By symbol of words or by echo of art




Lenvoi



 God willed who never needed speech
 Let all things be
 And lo the starry firmament
 And land and sea
 And his first thought of life that lives
 In you and me

 His circle of eternity
 We see in part
 Our spirits are his breath our hearts
 Beat from his heart
 Hence we have played as little gods
 And called it art

 Lacking his power we shared his dream
 Of perfect things
 Between the tents of hope and sweet
 Rememberings
 Have sat in ashes but our souls
 Went forth on wings

 Where life fell short of some desire
 In you and me
 Feeling for beauty which our eyes
 Could never see
 Behold from out the void we willed
 That it should be

 And sometimes dreamed our lisping songs
 Of humanhood
 Might voice his silent harmony
 Of waste and wood
 And he beholding his and ours
 Might find it good

Notes


John Charles McNeill was born in Scotland County near Laurinburg North
Carolina on 26 July 1874 and died on 17 October 1907 when he was 33
years old He only produced this one volume before he died though he
planned a second which was published posthumously Songs Merry and
Sad first published in Charlotte in 1906 went through at least five
printings over more than 60 years This text is taken from the very
first edition

Both of McNeills grandfathers came from Scotland

McNeill attended Wake Forest College where he received both his
Bachelors and Masters degrees In 18991900 he taught English at
Mercer University

Some of his poems were published nationally as early as 1901 More of
his poems were published by The Charlotte Observer starting in 1903
and in 1904 he joined its staff


This etext was created by entering the text manually twice once from
the first printing 1906 and once from the second printing no date
and comparing the two There were some slight differences in the two
printings

A portrait of John Charles McNeill faces the title page p 3 in the
second printing but is absent in the first

The first printing gives the publisher as Stone  Barringer Co and
gives the date as 1906 The second printing gives the publisher as
Stone Publishing Co and gives no date Both were printed in
Charlotte NC

One error was corrected the second printing also corrected this error

 p 73
  A holy presence hovers round here there 
 changed to
  A holy presence hovers round her there 


The second printing also changed the title of the poem  To Melvin
Gardner Suicide  on p 19 to  To Melvin Gardner in the text
but not in the table of Contents This may have been done in deference
to the familyattitudes on suicide were once quite different than
nowbut as it has been quite some time and the original title gives
more meaning to the poem it has been retained

The Title of the poem  Now  did not have the exclamation point in the
table of Contents It has been added to match the text The Title of
the poem  97 The Fast Mail  appeared as such in the text but as
97 The Fast Mail  in the Contents The latter was changed to match
the text

In the original the books title does not separate the Contents from
the first poem It has been placed there as a sort of divider

In two places ASCII fails to provide enough characters for a correct
rendering They are the words Provencal the c with a cedilla and
mailed the e with an acute accent to indicate that the word is to be
said with two syllables These occur in Reminiscence and The
Rattlesnake

including obsolete old middleaged and new computers It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
