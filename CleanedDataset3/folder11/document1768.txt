SCENE England

King Richard the Third



ACT I SCENE 1

London A street

Enter RICHARD DUKE OF GLOUCESTER solus

 GLOUCESTER Now is the winter of our discontent
 Made glorious summer by this sun of York
 And all the clouds that lourd upon our house
 In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
 Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
 Our bruised arms hung up for monuments
 Our stern alarums changd to merry meetings
 Our dreadful marches to delightful measures
 Grimvisagd war hath smoothd his wrinkled front
 And now instead of mounting barbed steeds
 To fright the souls of fearful adversaries
 He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber
 To the lascivious pleasing of a lute
 But Ithat am not shapd for sportive tricks
 Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass
 Ithat am rudely stampd and want loves majesty
 To strut before a wanton ambling nymph
 Ithat am curtaild of this fair proportion
 Cheated of feature by dissembling nature
 Deformd unfinishd sent before my time
 Into this breathing world scarce half made up
 And that so lamely and unfashionable
 That dogs bark at me as I halt by them
 Why I in this weak piping time of peace
 Have no delight to pass away the time
 Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
 And descant on mine own deformity
 And therefore since I cannot prove a lover
 To entertain these fair wellspoken days
 I am determined to prove a villain
 And hate the idle pleasures of these days
 Plots have I laid inductions dangerous
 By drunken prophecies libels and dreams
 To set my brother Clarence and the King
 In deadly hate the one against the other
 And if King Edward be as true and just
 As I am subtle false and treacherous
 This day should Clarence closely be mewd up
 About a prophecy which says that G
 Of Edwards heirs the murderer shall be
 Dive thoughts down to my soul Here Clarence comes

 Enter CLARENCE guarded and BRAKENBURY

 Brother good day What means this armed guard
 That waits upon your Grace
 CLARENCE His Majesty
 Tendring my persons safety hath appointed
 This conduct to convey me to th Tower
 GLOUCESTER Upon what cause
 CLARENCE Because my name is George
 GLOUCESTER Alack my lord that fault is none of yours
 He should for that commit your godfathers
 O belike his Majesty hath some intent
 That you should be newchristned in the Tower
 But whats the matter Clarence May I know
 CLARENCE Yea Richard when I know for I protest
 As yet I do not but as I can learn
 He hearkens after prophecies and dreams
 And from the crossrow plucks the letter G
 And says a wizard told him that by G
 His issue disinherited should be
 And for my name of George begins with G
 It follows in his thought that I am he
 These as I learn and such like toys as these
 Hath movd his Highness to commit me now
 GLOUCESTER Why this it is when men are ruld by women
 Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower
 My Lady Grey his wife Clarence tis she
 That tempers him to this extremity
 Was it not she and that good man of worship
 Antony Woodville her brother there
 That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower
 From whence this present day he is delivered
 We are not safe Clarence we are not safe
 CLARENCE By heaven I think there is no man is secure
 But the Queens kindred and nightwalking heralds
 That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore
 Heard you not what an humble suppliant
 Lord Hastings was for her delivery
 GLOUCESTER Humbly complaining to her deity
 Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty
 Ill tell you whatI think it is our way
 If we will keep in favour with the King
 To be her men and wear her livery
 The jealous oerworn widow and herself
 Since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen
 Are mighty gossips in our monarchy
 BRAKENBURY I beseech your Graces both to pardon me
 His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
 That no man shall have private conference
 Of what degree soever with your brother
 GLOUCESTER Even so ant please your worship Brakenbury
 You may partake of any thing we say
 We speak no treason man we say the King
 Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
 Well struck in years fair and not jealous
 We say that Shores wife hath a pretty foot
 A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
 And that the Queens kindred are made gentlefolks
 How say you sir Can you deny all this
 BRAKENBURY With this my lord myself have naught to do
 GLOUCESTER Naught to do with Mistress Shore I tell thee
 fellow
 He that doth naught with her excepting one
 Were best to do it secretly alone
 BRAKENBURY What one my lord
 GLOUCESTER Her husband knave Wouldst thou betray me
 BRAKENBURY I do beseech your Grace to pardon me and
 withal
 Forbear your conference with the noble Duke
 CLARENCE We know thy charge Brakenbury and will
 obey
 GLOUCESTER We are the Queens abjects and must obey
 Brother farewell I will unto the King
 And whatsoeer you will employ me in
 Were it to call King Edwards widow sister
 I will perform it to enfranchise you
 Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
 Touches me deeper than you can imagine
 CLARENCE I know it pleaseth neither of us well
 GLOUCESTER Well your imprisonment shall not be long
 I will deliver or else lie for you
 Meantime have patience
 CLARENCE I must perforce Farewell
 Exeunt CLARENCE BRAKENBURY and guard
 GLOUCESTER Go tread the path that thou shalt neer return
 Simple plain Clarence I do love thee so
 That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven
 If heaven will take the present at our hands
 But who comes here The newdelivered Hastings

 Enter LORD HASTINGS

 HASTINGS Good time of day unto my gracious lord
 GLOUCESTER As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain
 Well are you welcome to the open air
 How hath your lordship brookd imprisonment
 HASTINGS With patience noble lord as prisoners must
 But I shall live my lord to give them thanks
 That were the cause of my imprisonment
 GLOUCESTER No doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too
 For they that were your enemies are his
 And have prevaild as much on him as you
 HASTINGS More pity that the eagles should be mewd
 Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty
 GLOUCESTER What news abroad
 HASTINGS No news so bad abroad as this at home
 The King is sickly weak and melancholy
 And his physicians fear him mightily
 GLOUCESTER Now by Saint John that news is bad indeed
 O he hath kept an evil diet long
 And overmuch consumd his royal person
 Tis very grievous to be thought upon
 Where is he In his bed
 HASTINGS He is
 GLOUCESTER Go you before and I will follow you
 Exit HASTINGS
 He cannot live I hope and must not die
 Till George be packd with posthorse up to heaven
 Ill in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
 With lies well steeld with weighty arguments
 And if I fail not in my deep intent
 Clarence hath not another day to live
 Which done God take King Edward to his mercy
 And leave the world for me to bustle in
 For then Ill marry Warwicks youngest daughter
 What though I killd her husband and her father
 The readiest way to make the wench amends
 Is to become her husband and her father
 The which will Inot all so much for love
 As for another secret close intent
 By marrying her which I must reach unto
 But yet I run before my horse to market
 Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns
 When they are gone then must I count my gains Exit




SCENE 2

London Another street

Enter corpse of KING HENRY THE SIXTH with halberds to guard it
LADY ANNE being the mourner attended by TRESSEL and BERKELEY

 ANNE Set down set down your honourable load
 If honour may be shrouded in a hearse
 Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
 Th untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster
 Poor keycold figure of a holy king
 Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster
 Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
 Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
 To hear the lamentations of poor Anne
 Wife to thy Edward to thy slaughtered son
 Stabbd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds
 Lo in these windows that let forth thy life
 I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
 O cursed be the hand that made these holes
 Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it
 Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
 More direful hap betide that hated wretch
 That makes us wretched by the death of thee
 Than I can wish to adders spiders toads
 Or any creeping venomd thing that lives
 If ever he have child abortive be it
 Prodigious and untimely brought to light
 Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
 May fright the hopeful mother at the view
 And that be heir to his unhappiness
 If ever he have wife let her be made
 More miserable by the death of him
 Than I am made by my young lord and thee
 Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load
 Taken from Pauls to be interred there
 And still as you are weary of this weight
 Rest you whiles I lament King Henrys corse
 The bearers take up the coffin

 Enter GLOUCESTER

 GLOUCESTER Stay you that bear the corse and set it down
 ANNE What black magician conjures up this fiend
 To stop devoted charitable deeds
 GLOUCESTER Villains set down the corse or by Saint Paul
 Ill make a corse of him that disobeys
 FIRST GENTLEMAN My lord stand back and let the coffin
 pass
 GLOUCESTER Unmannerd dog Stand thou when I command
 Advance thy halberd higher than my breast
 Or by Saint Paul Ill strike thee to my foot
 And spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
 The bearers set down the coffin
 ANNE What do you tremble Are you all afraid
 Alas I blame you not for you are mortal
 And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
 Avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
 Thou hadst but power over his mortal body
 His soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
 GLOUCESTER Sweet saint for charity be not so curst
 ANNE Foul devil for Gods sake hence and trouble us not
 For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
 Filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
 If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
 Behold this pattern of thy butcheries
 O gentlemen see see Dead Henrys wounds
 Open their congeald mouths and bleed afresh
 Blush blush thou lump of foul deformity
 For tis thy presence that exhales this blood
 From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
 Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
 Provokes this deluge most unnatural
 O God which this blood madst revenge his death
 O earth which this blood drinkst revenge his death
 Either heavn with lightning strike the murdrer dead
 Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
 As thou dost swallow up this good kings blood
 Which his hellgovernd arm hath butchered
 GLOUCESTER Lady you know no rules of charity
 Which renders good for bad blessings for curses
 ANNE Villain thou knowest nor law of God nor man
 No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
 GLOUCESTER But I know none and therefore am no beast
 ANNE O wonderful when devils tell the truth
 GLOUCESTER More wonderful when angels are so angry
 Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
 Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
 By circumstance but to acquit myself
 ANNE Vouchsafe diffusd infection of a man
 Of these known evils but to give me leave
 By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self
 GLOUCESTER Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
 Some patient leisure to excuse myself
 ANNE Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
 No excuse current but to hang thyself
 GLOUCESTER By such despair I should accuse myself
 ANNE And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
 For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
 That didst unworthy slaughter upon others
 GLOUCESTER Say that I slew them not
 ANNE Then say they were not slain
 But dead they are and devilish slave by thee
 GLOUCESTER I did not kill your husband
 ANNE Why then he is alive
 GLOUCESTER Nay he is dead and slain by Edwards hands
 ANNE In thy foul throat thou liest Queen Margaret saw
 Thy murdrous falchion smoking in his blood
 The which thou once didst bend against her breast
 But that thy brothers beat aside the point
 GLOUCESTER I was provoked by her slandrous tongue
 That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
 ANNE Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
 That never dreamst on aught but butcheries
 Didst thou not kill this king
 GLOUCESTER I grant ye
 ANNE Dost grant me hedgehog Then God grant me too
 Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
 O he was gentle mild and virtuous
 GLOUCESTER The better for the King of Heaven that hath
 him
 ANNE He is in heaven where thou shalt never come
 GLOUCESTER Let him thank me that holp to send him
 thither
 For he was fitter for that place than earth
 ANNE And thou unfit for any place but hell
 GLOUCESTER Yes one place else if you will hear me name it
 ANNE Some dungeon
 GLOUCESTER Your bedchamber
 ANNE Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest
 GLOUCESTER So will it madam till I lie with you
 ANNE I hope so
 GLOUCESTER I know so But gentle Lady Anne
 To leave this keen encounter of our wits
 And fall something into a slower method
 Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
 Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward
 As blameful as the executioner
 ANNE Thou wast the cause and most accursd effect
 GLOUCESTER Your beauty was the cause of that effect
 Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep
 To undertake the death of all the world
 So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom
 ANNE If I thought that I tell thee homicide
 These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
 GLOUCESTER These eyes could not endure that beautys
 wreck
 You should not blemish it if I stood by
 As all the world is cheered by the sun
 So I by that it is my day my life
 ANNE Black night oershade thy day and death thy life
 GLOUCESTER Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
 ANNE I would I were to be revengd on thee
 GLOUCESTER It is a quarrel most unnatural
 To be revengd on him that loveth thee
 ANNE It is a quarrel just and reasonable
 To be revengd on him that killd my husband
 GLOUCESTER He that bereft thee lady of thy husband
 Did it to help thee to a better husband
 ANNE His better doth not breathe upon the earth
 GLOUCESTER He lives that loves thee better than he could
 ANNE Name him
 GLOUCESTER Plantagenet
 ANNE Why that was he
 GLOUCESTER The selfsame name but one of better nature
 ANNE Where is he
 GLOUCESTER Here She spits at him Why dost thou spit
 at me
 ANNE Would it were mortal poison for thy sake
 GLOUCESTER Never came poison from so sweet a place
 ANNE Never hung poison on a fouler toad
 Out of my sight Thou dost infect mine eyes
 GLOUCESTER Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
 ANNE Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
 GLOUCESTER I would they were that I might die at once
 For now they kill me with a living death
 Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
 Shamd their aspects with store of childish drops
 These eyes which never shed remorseful tear
 No when my father York and Edward wept
 To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
 When blackfacd Clifford shook his sword at him
 Nor when thy warlike father like a child
 Told the sad story of my fathers death
 And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
 That all the standersby had wet their cheeks
 Like trees bedashd with rainin that sad time
 My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
 And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
 Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
 I never sued to friend nor enemy
 My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
 But now thy beauty is proposd my fee
 My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
 She looks scornfully at him
 Teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made
 For kissing lady not for such contempt
 If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
 Lo here I lend thee this sharppointed sword
 Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
 And let the soul forth that adoreth thee
 I lay it naked to the deadly stroke
 And humbly beg the death upon my knee
 He lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword
 Nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry
 But twas thy beauty that provoked me
 Nay now dispatch twas I that stabbd young Edward
 But twas thy heavenly face that set me on
 She falls the sword
 Take up the sword again or take up me
 ANNE Arise dissembler though I wish thy death
 I will not be thy executioner
 GLOUCESTER Then bid me kill myself and I will do it
 ANNE I have already
 GLOUCESTER That was in thy rage
 Speak it again and even with the word
 This hand which for thy love did kill thy love
 Shall for thy love kill a far truer love
 To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary
 ANNE I would I knew thy heart
 GLOUCESTER Tis figurd in my tongue
 ANNE I fear me both are false
 GLOUCESTER Then never was man true
 ANNE well put up your sword
 GLOUCESTER Say then my peace is made
 ANNE That shalt thou know hereafter
 GLOUCESTER But shall I live in hope
 ANNE All men I hope live so
 GLOUCESTER Vouchsafe to wear this ring
 ANNE To take is not to give Puts on the ring
 GLOUCESTER Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger
 Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
 Wear both of them for both of them are thine
 And if thy poor devoted servant may
 But beg one favour at thy gracious hand
 Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
 ANNE What is it
 GLOUCESTER That it may please you leave these sad designs
 To him that hath most cause to be a mourner
 And presently repair to Crosby House
 Whereafter I have solemnly interrd
 At Chertsey monastry this noble king
 And wet his grave with my repentant tears
 I will with all expedient duty see you
 For divers unknown reasons I beseech you
 Grant me this boon
 ANNE With all my heart and much it joys me too
 To see you are become so penitent
 Tressel and Berkeley go along with me
 GLOUCESTER Bid me farewell
 ANNE Tis more than you deserve
 But since you teach me how to flatter you
 Imagine I have said farewell already
 Exeunt two GENTLEMEN With LADY ANNE
 GLOUCESTER Sirs take up the corse
 GENTLEMEN Towards Chertsey noble lord
 GLOUCESTER No to White Friars there attend my coming
 Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
 Was ever woman in this humour wood
 Was ever woman in this humour won
 Ill have her but I will not keep her long
 What I that killd her husband and his father
 To take her in her hearts extremest hate
 With curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
 The bleeding witness of my hatred by
 Having God her conscience and these bars against me
 And I no friends to back my suit at all
 But the plain devil and dissembling looks
 And yet to win her all the world to nothing
 Ha
 Hath she forgot already that brave prince
 Edward her lord whom I some three months since
 Stabbd in my angry mood at Tewksbury
 A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
 Framd in the prodigality of nature
 Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
 The spacious world cannot again afford
 And will she yet abase her eyes on me
 That croppd the golden prime of this sweet prince
 And made her widow to a woeful bed
 On me whose all not equals Edwards moiety
 On me that halts and am misshapen thus
 My dukedom to a beggarly denier
 I do mistake my person all this while
 Upon my life she finds although I cannot
 Myself to be a marvllous proper man
 Ill be at charges for a lookingglass
 And entertain a score or two of tailors
 To study fashions to adorn my body
 Since I am crept in favour with myself
 I will maintain it with some little cost
 But first Ill turn yon fellow in his grave
 And then return lamenting to my love
 Shine out fair sun till I have bought a glass
 That I may see my shadow as I pass Exit




SCENE 3

London The palace

Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH LORD RIVERS and LORD GREY

 RIVERS Have patience madam theres no doubt his Majesty
 Will soon recover his accustomd health
 GREY In that you brook it ill it makes him worse
 Therefore for Gods sake entertain good comfort
 And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes
 QUEEN ELIZABETH If he were dead what would betide on
 me
 GREY No other harm but loss of such a lord
 QUEEN ELIZABETH The loss of such a lord includes all
 harms
 GREY The heavens have blessd you with a goodly son
 To be your comforter when he is gone
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah he is young and his minority
 Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester
 A man that loves not me nor none of you
 RIVER Is it concluded he shall be Protector
 QUEEN ELIZABETH It is determind not concluded yet
 But so it must be if the King miscarry

 Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY

 GREY Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby
 BUCKINGHAM Good time of day unto your royal Grace
 DERBY God make your Majesty joyful as you have been
 QUEEN ELIZABETH The Countess Richmond good my Lord
 of Derby
 To your good prayer will scarcely say amen
 Yet Derby notwithstanding shes your wife
 And loves not me be you good lord assurd
 I hate not you for her proud arrogance
 DERBY I do beseech you either not believe
 The envious slanders of her false accusers
 Or if she be accusd on true report
 Bear with her weakness which I think proceeds
 From wayward sickness and no grounded malice
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Saw you the King today my Lord of
 Derby
 DERBY But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
 Are come from visiting his Majesty
 QUEEN ELIZABETH What likelihood of his amendment
 Lords
 BUCKINGHAM Madam good hope his Grace speaks
 cheerfully
 QUEEN ELIZABETH God grant him health Did you confer
 with him
 BUCKINGHAM Ay madam he desires to make atonement
 Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers
 And between them and my Lord Chamberlain
 And sent to warn them to his royal presence
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Would all were well But that will
 never be
 I fear our happiness is at the height

 Enter GLOUCESTER HASTINGS and DORSET

 GLOUCESTER They do me wrong and I will not endure it
 Who is it that complains unto the King
 That I forsooth am stern and love them not
 By holy Paul they love his Grace but lightly
 That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
 Because I cannot flatter and look fair
 Smile in mens faces smooth deceive and cog
 Duck with French nods and apish courtesy
 I must be held a rancorous enemy
 Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
 But thus his simple truth must be abusd
 With silken sly insinuating Jacks
 GREY To who in all this presence speaks your Grace
 GLOUCESTER To thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
 When have I injurd thee when done thee wrong
 Or thee or thee or any of your faction
 A plague upon you all His royal Grace
 Whom God preserve better than you would wish
 Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while
 But you must trouble him with lewd complaints
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Brother of Gloucester you mistake the
 matter
 The King on his own royal disposition
 And not provokd by any suitor else
 Aiming belike at your interior hatred
 That in your outward action shows itself
 Against my children brothers and myself
 Makes him to send that he may learn the ground
 GLOUCESTER I cannot tell the world is grown so bad
 That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
 Since every Jack became a gentleman
 Theres many a gentle person made a Jack
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Come come we know your meaning
 brother Gloucester
 You envy my advancement and my friends
 God grant we never may have need of you
 GLOUCESTER Meantime God grants that I have need of you
 Our brother is imprisond by your means
 Myself disgracd and the nobility
 Held in contempt while great promotions
 Are daily given to ennoble those
 That scarce some two days since were worth a noble
 QUEEN ELIZABETH By Him that raisd me to this careful
 height
 From that contented hap which I enjoyd
 I never did incense his Majesty
 Against the Duke of Clarence but have been
 An earnest advocate to plead for him
 My lord you do me shameful injury
 Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
 GLOUCESTER You may deny that you were not the mean
 Of my Lord Hastings late imprisonment
 RIVERS She may my lord for
 GLOUCESTER She may Lord Rivers Why who knows
 not so
 She may do more sir than denying that
 She may help you to many fair preferments
 And then deny her aiding hand therein
 And lay those honours on your high desert
 What may she not She mayay marry may she
 RIVERS What marry may she
 GLOUCESTER What marry may she Marry with a king
 A bachelor and a handsome stripling too
 Iwis your grandam had a worser match
 QUEEN ELIZABETH My Lord of Gloucester I have too long
 borne
 Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
 By heaven I will acquaint his Majesty
 Of those gross taunts that oft I have endurd
 I had rather be a country servantmaid
 Than a great queen with this condition
 To be so baited scornd and stormed at

 Enter old QUEEN MARGARET behind

 Small joy have I in being Englands Queen
 QUEEN MARGARET And lessned be that small God I
 beseech Him
 Thy honour state and seat is due to me
 GLOUCESTER What Threat you me with telling of the
 King
 Tell him and spare not Look what I have said
 I will avoucht in presence of the King
 I dare adventure to be sent to th Towr
 Tis time to speakmy pains are quite forgot
 QUEEN MARGARET Out devil I do remember them to
 well
 Thou killdst my husband Henry in the Tower
 And Edward my poor son at Tewksbury
 GLOUCESTER Ere you were queen ay or your husband
 King
 I was a packhorse in his great affairs
 A weederout of his proud adversaries
 A liberal rewarder of his friends
 To royalize his blood I spent mine own
 QUEEN MARGARET Ay and much better blood than his or
 thine
 GLOUCESTER In all which time you and your husband Grey
 Were factious for the house of Lancaster
 And Rivers so were you Was not your husband
 In Margarets battle at Saint Albans slain
 Let me put in your minds if you forget
 What you have been ere this and what you are
 Withal what I have been and what I am
 QUEEN MARGARET A murdrous villain and so still thou art
 GLOUCESTER Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick
 Ay and forswore himselfwhich Jesu pardon
 QUEEN MARGARET Which God revenge
 GLOUCESTER To fight on Edwards party for the crown
 And for his meed poor lord he is mewed up
 I would to God my heart were flint like Edwards
 Or Edwards soft and pitiful like mine
 I am too childishfoolish for this world
 QUEEN MARGARET Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this
 world
 Thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is
 RIVERS My Lord of Gloucester in those busy days
 Which here you urge to prove us enemies
 We followd then our lord our sovereign king
 So should we you if you should be our king
 GLOUCESTER If I should be I had rather be a pedlar
 Far be it from my heart the thought thereof
 QUEEN ELIZABETH As little joy my lord as you suppose
 You should enjoy were you this countrys king
 As little joy you may suppose in me
 That I enjoy being the Queen thereof
 QUEEN MARGARET As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof
 For I am she and altogether joyless
 I can no longer hold me patient Advancing
 Hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
 In sharing that which you have pilld from me
 Which of you trembles not that looks on me
 If not that I am Queen you bow like subjects
 Yet that by you deposd you quake like rebels
 Ah gentle villain do not turn away
 GLOUCESTER Foul wrinkled witch what makst thou in my
 sight
 QUEEN MARGARET But repetition of what thou hast marrd
 That will I make before I let thee go
 GLOUCESTER Wert thou not banished on pain of death
 QUEEN MARGARET I was but I do find more pain in
 banishment
 Than death can yield me here by my abode
 A husband and a son thou owst to me
 And thou a kingdom all of you allegiance
 This sorrow that I have by right is yours
 And all the pleasures you usurp are mine
 GLOUCESTER The curse my noble father laid on thee
 When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
 And with thy scorns drewst rivers from his eyes
 And then to dry them gavst the Duke a clout
 Steepd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland
 His curses then from bitterness of soul
 Denouncd against thee are all falln upon thee
 And God not we hath plagud thy bloody deed
 QUEEN ELIZABETH So just is God to right the innocent
 HASTINGS O twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
 And the most merciless that eer was heard of
 RIVERS Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
 DORSET No man but prophesied revenge for it
 BUCKINGHAM Northumberland then present wept to see it
 QUEEN MARGARET What were you snarling all before I came
 Ready to catch each other by the throat
 And turn you all your hatred now on me
 Did Yorks dread curse prevail so much with heaven
 That Henrys death my lovely Edwards death
 Their kingdoms loss my woeful banishment
 Should all but answer for that peevish brat
 Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
 Why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
 Though not by war by surfeit die your king
 As ours by murder to make him a king
 Edward thy son that now is Prince of Wales
 For Edward our son that was Prince of Wales
 Die in his youth by like untimely violence
 Thyself a queen for me that was a queen
 Outlive thy glory like my wretched self
 Long mayest thou live to wail thy childrens death
 And see another as I see thee now
 Deckd in thy rights as thou art stalld in mine
 Long die thy happy days before thy death
 And after many lengthned hours of grief
 Die neither mother wife nor Englands Queen
 Rivers and Dorset you were standers by
 And so wast thou Lord Hastings when my son
 Was stabbd with bloody daggers God I pray him
 That none of you may live his natural age
 But by some unlookd accident cut off
 GLOUCESTER Have done thy charm thou hateful witherd
 hag
 QUEEN MARGARET And leave out thee Stay dog for thou
 shalt hear me
 If heaven have any grievous plague in store
 Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee
 O let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
 And then hurl down their indignation
 On thee the troubler of the poor worlds peace
 The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul
 Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livst
 And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
 No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
 Unless it be while some tormenting dream
 Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
 Thou elvishmarkd abortive rooting hog
 Thou that wast seald in thy nativity
 The slave of nature and the son of hell
 Thou slander of thy heavy mothers womb
 Thou loathed issue of thy fathers loins
 Thou rag of honour thou detested
 GLOUCESTER Margaret
 QUEEN MARGARET Richard
 GLOUCESTER Ha
 QUEEN MARGARET I call thee not
 GLOUCESTER I cry thee mercy then for I did think
 That thou hadst calld me all these bitter names
 QUEEN MARGARET Why so I did but lookd for no reply
 O let me make the period to my curse
 GLOUCESTER Tis done by me and ends inMargaret
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Thus have you breathd your curse
 against yourself
 QUEEN MARGARET Poor painted queen vain flourish of my
 fortune
 Why strewst thou sugar on that bottled spider
 Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
 Fool fool thou whetst a knife to kill thyself
 The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
 To help thee curse this poisonous bunchbackd toad
 HASTINGS Falseboding woman end thy frantic curse
 Lest to thy harm thou move our patience
 QUEEN MARGARET Foul shame upon you you have all
 movd mine
 RIVERS Were you well servd you would be taught your
 duty
 QUEEN MARGARET To serve me well you all should do me
 duty
 Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects
 O serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
 DORSET Dispute not with her she is lunatic
 QUEEN MARGARET Peace Master Marquis you are malapert
 Your firenew stamp of honour is scarce current
 O that your young nobility could judge
 What twere to lose it and be miserable
 They that stand high have many blasts to shake them
 And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
 GLOUCESTER Good counsel marry learn it learn it Marquis
 DORSET It touches you my lord as much as me
 GLOUCESTER Ay and much more but I was born so high
 Our aery buildeth in the cedars top
 And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun
 QUEEN MARGARET And turns the sun to shadealas alas
 Witness my son now in the shade of death
 Whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath
 Hath in eternal darkness folded up
 Your aery buildeth in our aerys nest
 O God that seest it do not suffer it
 As it is won with blood lost be it so
 BUCKINGHAM Peace peace for shame if not for charity
 QUEEN MARGARET Urge neither charity nor shame to me
 Uncharitably with me have you dealt
 And shamefully my hopes by you are butcherd
 My charity is outrage life my shame
 And in that shame still live my sorrows rage
 BUCKINGHAM Have done have done
 QUEEN MARGARET O princely Buckingham Ill kiss thy
 hand
 In sign of league and amity with thee
 Now fair befall thee and thy noble house
 Thy garments are not spotted with our blood
 Nor thou within the compass of my curse
 BUCKINGHAM Nor no one here for curses never pass
 The lips of those that breathe them in the air
 QUEEN MARGARET I will not think but they ascend the sky
 And there awake Gods gentlesleeping peace
 O Buckingham take heed of yonder dog
 Look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
 His venom tooth will rankle to the death
 Have not to do with him beware of him
 Sin death and hell have set their marks on him
 And all their ministers attend on him
 GLOUCESTER What doth she say my Lord of Buckingham
 BUCKINGHAM Nothing that I respect my gracious lord
 QUEEN MARGARET What dost thou scorn me for my gentle
 counsel
 And soothe the devil that I warn thee from
 O but remember this another day
 When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
 And say poor Margaret was a prophetess
 Live each of you the subjects to his hate
 And he to yours and all of you to Gods Exit
 BUCKINGHAM My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses
 RIVERS And so doth mine I muse why shes at liberty
 GLOUCESTER I cannot blame her by Gods holy Mother
 She hath had too much wrong and I repent
 My part thereof that I have done to her
 QUEEN ELIZABETH I never did her any to my knowledge
 GLOUCESTER Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong
 I was too hot to do somebody good
 That is too cold in thinking of it now
 Marry as for Clarence he is well repaid
 He is frankd up to fatting for his pains
 God pardon them that are the cause thereof
 RIVERS A virtuous and a Christianlike conclusion
 To pray for them that have done scathe to us
 GLOUCESTER So do I ever Aside being well advisd
 For had I cursd now I had cursd myself

 Enter CATESBY

 CATESBY Madam his Majesty doth can for you
 And for your Grace and you my gracious lords
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Catesby I come Lords will you go
 with me
 RIVERS We wait upon your Grace
 Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
 GLOUCESTER I do the wrong and first begin to brawl
 The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
 I lay unto the grievous charge of others
 Clarence who I indeed have cast in darkness
 I do beweep to many simple gulls
 Namely to Derby Hastings Buckingham
 And tell them tis the Queen and her allies
 That stir the King against the Duke my brother
 Now they believe it and withal whet me
 To be revengd on Rivers Dorset Grey
 But then I sigh and with a piece of Scripture
 Tell them that God bids us do good for evil
 And thus I clothe my naked villainy
 With odd old ends stoln forth of holy writ
 And seem a saint when most I play the devil

 Enter two MURDERERS

 But soft here come my executioners
 How now my hardy stout resolved mates
 Are you now going to dispatch this thing
 FIRST MURDERER We are my lord and come to have the
 warrant
 That we may be admitted where he is
 GLOUCESTER Well thought upon I have it here about me
 Gives the warrant
 When you have done repair to Crosby Place
 But sirs be sudden in the execution
 Withal obdurate do not hear him plead
 For Clarence is wellspoken and perhaps
 May move your hearts to pity if you mark him
 FIRST MURDERER Tut tut my lord we will not stand to
 prate
 Talkers are no good doers Be assurd
 We go to use our hands and not our tongues
 GLOUCESTER Your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes fall
 tears
 I like you lads about your business straight
 Go go dispatch
 FIRST MURDERER We will my noble lord Exeunt




SCENE 4

London The Tower

Enter CLARENCE and KEEPER

 KEEPER Why looks your Grace so heavily today
 CLARENCE O I have passd a miserable night
 So full of fearful dreams of ugly sights
 That as I am a Christian faithful man
 I would not spend another such a night
 Though twere to buy a world of happy days
 So full of dismal terror was the time
 KEEPER What was your dream my lord I pray you
 tell me
 CLARENCE Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
 And was embarkd to cross to Burgundy
 And in my company my brother Gloucester
 Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
 Upon the hatches Thence we lookd toward England
 And cited up a thousand heavy times
 During the wars of York and Lancaster
 That had befalln us As we pacd along
 Upon the giddy footing of the hatches
 Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling
 Struck me that thought to stay him overboard
 Into the tumbling billows of the main
 O Lord methought what pain it was to drown
 What dreadful noise of waters in my ears
 What sights of ugly death within my eyes
 Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks
 A thousand men that fishes gnawd upon
 Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
 Inestimable stones unvalued jewels
 All scattred in the bottom of the sea
 Some lay in dead mens skulls and in the holes
 Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
 As twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
 That wood the slimy bottom of the deep
 And mockd the dead bones that lay scattred by
 KEEPER Had you such leisure in the time of death
 To gaze upon these secrets of the deep
 CLARENCE Methought I had and often did I strive
 To yield the ghost but still the envious flood
 Stoppd in my soul and would not let it forth
 To find the empty vast and wandring air
 But smotherd it within my panting bulk
 Who almost burst to belch it in the sea
 KEEPER Awakd you not in this sore agony
 CLARENCE No no my dream was lengthend after life
 O then began the tempest to my soul
 I passd methought the melancholy flood
 With that sour ferryman which poets write of
 Unto the kingdom of perpetual night
 The first that there did greet my stranger soul
 Was my great fatherinlaw renowned Warwick
 Who spake aloud What scourge for perjury
 Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence
 And so he vanishd Then came wandring by
 A shadow like an angel with bright hair
 Dabbled in blood and he shriekd out aloud
 Clarence is comefalse fleeting perjurd Clarence
 That stabbd me in the field by Tewksbury
 Seize on him Furies take him unto torment
 With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
 Environd me and howled in mine ears
 Such hideous cries that with the very noise
 I trembling wakd and for a season after
 Could not believe but that I was in hell
 Such terrible impression made my dream
 KEEPER No marvel lord though it affrighted you
 I am afraid methinks to hear you tell it
 CLARENCE Ah Keeper Keeper I have done these things
 That now give evidence against my soul
 For Edwards sake and see how he requites me
 O God If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee
 But Thou wilt be avengd on my misdeeds
 Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone
 O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
 KEEPER I prithee sit by me awhile
 My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep
 KEEPER I will my lord God give your Grace good rest
 CLARENCE sleeps

 Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant

 BRAKENBURY Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
 Makes the night morning and the noontide night
 Princes have but their titles for their glories
 An outward honour for an inward toil
 And for unfelt imaginations
 They often feel a world of restless cares
 So that between their tides and low name
 Theres nothing differs but the outward fame

 Enter the two MURDERERS

 FIRST MURDERER Ho whos here
 BRAKENBURY What wouldst thou fellow and how camst
 thou hither
 FIRST MURDERER I would speak with Clarence and I came
 hither on my legs
 BRAKENBURY What so brief
 SECOND MURDERER Tis better sir than to be tedious Let
 him see our commission and talk no more
 BRAKENBURY reads it
 BRAKENBURY I am in this commanded to deliver
 The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands
 I will not reason what is meant hereby
 Because I will be guiltless from the meaning
 There lies the Duke asleep and there the keys
 Ill to the King and signify to him
 That thus I have resignd to you my charge
 FIRST MURDERER You may sir tis a point of wisdom Fare
 you well Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER
 SECOND MURDERER What shall I stab him as he sleeps
 FIRST MURDERER No hell say twas done cowardly when
 he wakes
 SECOND MURDERER Why he shall never wake until the great
 judgmentday
 FIRST MURDERER Why then hell say we stabbd him
 sleeping
 SECOND MURDERER The urging of that word judgment hath
 bred a kind of remorse in me
 FIRST MURDERER What art thou afraid
 SECOND MURDERER Not to kill him having a warrant but to
 be damnd for killing him from the which no warrant can
 defend me
 FIRST MURDERER I thought thou hadst been resolute
 SECOND MURDERER So I am to let him live
 FIRST MURDERER Ill back to the Duke of Gloucester and
 tell him so
 SECOND MURDERER Nay I prithee stay a little I hope this
 passionate humour of mine will change it was wont to
 hold me but while one tells twenty
 FIRST MURDERER How dost thou feel thyself now
 SECOND MURDERER Faith some certain dregs of conscience
 are yet within me
 FIRST MURDERER Remember our reward when the deeds
 done
 SECOND MURDERER Zounds he dies I had forgot the reward
 FIRST MURDERER Wheres thy conscience now
 SECOND MURDERER O in the Duke of Gloucesters purse
 FIRST MURDERER When he opens his purse to give us our
 reward thy conscience flies out
 SECOND MURDERER Tis no matter let it go theres few or
 none will entertain it
 FIRST MURDERER What if it come to thee again
 SECOND MURDERER Ill not meddle with itit makes a man
 coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man
 cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his
 neighbours wife but it detects him Tis a blushing shame
 facd spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom it fills a man
 full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold
 thatby chance I found It beggars any man that keeps it
 It is turnd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing
 and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
 to himself and live without it
 FIRST MURDERER Zounds tis even now at my elbow
 persuading me not to kill the Duke
 SECOND MURDERER Take the devil in thy mind and believe
 him not he would insinuate with thee but to make thee
 sigh
 FIRST MURDERER I am strongframd he cannot prevail with
 me
 SECOND MURDERER Spoke like a tall man that respects thy
 reputation Come shall we fall to work
 FIRST MURDERER Take him on the costard with the hilts of
 thy sword and then chop him in the malmseybutt in the
 next room
 SECOND MURDERER O excellent device and make a sop of
 him
 FIRST MURDERER Soft he wakes
 SECOND MURDERER Strike
 FIRST MURDERER No well reason with him
 CLARENCE Where art thou Keeper Give me a cup of wine
 SECOND MURDERER You shall have wine enough my lord
 anon
 CLARENCE In Gods name what art thou
 FIRST MURDERER A man as you are
 CLARENCE But not as I am royal
 SECOND MURDERER Nor you as we are loyal
 CLARENCE Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
 FIRST MURDERER My voice is now the Kings my looks
 mine own
 CLARENCE How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
 Your eyes do menace me Why look you pale
 Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come
 SECOND MURDERER To to to
 CLARENCE To murder me
 BOTH MURDERERS Ay ay
 CLARENCE You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
 And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
 Wherein my friends have I offended you
 FIRST MURDERER Offended us you have not but the King
 CLARENCE I shall be reconcild to him again
 SECOND MURDERER Never my lord therefore prepare to die
 CLARENCE Are you drawn forth among a world of men
 To slay the innocent What is my offence
 Where is the evidence that doth accuse me
 What lawful quest have given their verdict up
 Unto the frowning judge or who pronouncd
 The bitter sentence of poor Clarence death
 Before I be convict by course of law
 To threaten me with death is most unlawful
 I charge you as you hope to have redemption
 By Christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins
 That you depart and lay no hands on me
 The deed you undertake is damnable
 FIRST MURDERER What we will do we do upon command
 SECOND MURDERER And he that hath commanded is our
 King
 CLARENCE Erroneous vassals the great King of kings
 Hath in the tables of his law commanded
 That thou shalt do no murder Will you then
 Spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans
 Take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand
 To hurl upon their heads that break his law
 SECOND MURDERER And that same vengeance doth he hurl
 on thee
 For false forswearing and for murder too
 Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
 In quarrel of the house of Lancaster
 FIRST MURDERER And like a traitor to the name of God
 Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
 Unrippdst the bowels of thy sovreigns son
 SECOND MURDERER Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
 defend
 FIRST MURDERER How canst thou urge Gods dreadful law
 to us
 When thou hast broke it in such dear degree
 CLARENCE Alas for whose sake did I that ill deed
 For Edward for my brother for his sake
 He sends you not to murder me for this
 For in that sin he is as deep as I
 If God will be avenged for the deed
 O know you yet He doth it publicly
 Take not the quarrel from His powrful arm
 He needs no indirect or lawless course
 To cut off those that have offended Him
 FIRST MURDERER Who made thee then a bloody minister
 When gallantspringing brave Plantagenet
 That princely novice was struck dead by thee
 CLARENCE My brothers love the devil and my rage
 FIRST MURDERER Thy brothers love our duty and thy
 faults
 Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
 CLARENCE If you do love my brother hate not me
 I am his brother and I love him well
 If you are hird for meed go back again
 And I will send you to my brother Gloucester
 Who shall reward you better for my life
 Than Edward will for tidings of my death
 SECOND MURDERER You are deceivd your brother Gloucester
 hates you
 CLARENCE O no he loves me and he holds me dear
 Go you to him from me
 FIRST MURDERER Ay so we will
 CLARENCE Tell him when that our princely father York
 Blessd his three sons with his victorious arm
 And chargd us from his soul to love each other
 He little thought of this divided friendship
 Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weep
 FIRST MURDERER Ay millstones as he lessond us to weep
 CLARENCE O do not slander him for he is kind
 FIRST MURDERER Right as snow in harvest Come you
 deceive yourself
 Tis he that sends us to destroy you here
 CLARENCE It cannot be for he bewept my fortune
 And huggd me in his arms and swore with sobs
 That he would labour my delivery
 FIRST MURDERER Why so he doth when he delivers you
 From this earths thraldom to the joys of heaven
 SECOND MURDERER Make peace with God for you must die
 my lord
 CLARENCE Have you that holy feeling in your souls
 To counsel me to make my peace with God
 And are you yet to your own souls so blind
 That you will war with God by murdring me
 O sirs consider they that set you on
 To do this deed will hate you for the deed
 SECOND MURDERER What shall we do
 CLARENCE Relent and save your souls
 FIRST MURDERER Relent No tis cowardly and womanish
 CLARENCE Not to relent is beastly savage devilish
 Which of you if you were a princes son
 Being pent from liberty as I am now
 If two such murderers as yourselves came to you
 Would not entreat for life
 My friend I spy some pity in thy looks
 O if thine eye be not a flatterer
 Come thou on my side and entreat for me
 As you would beg were you in my distress
 A begging prince what beggar pities not
 SECOND MURDERER Look behind you my lord
 FIRST MURDERER Stabbing him Take that and that If all
 this will not do
 Ill drown you in the malmseybutt within
 Exit with the body
 SECOND MURDERER A bloody deed and desperately
 dispatchd
 How fain like Pilate would I wash my hands
 Of this most grievous murder

 Reenter FIRST MURDERER

 FIRST MURDERERHow now what meanst thou that thou
 helpst me not
 By heavens the Duke shall know how slack you have
 been
 SECOND MURDERER I would he knew that I had savd his
 brother
 Take thou the fee and tell him what I say
 For I repent me that the Duke is slain Exit
 FIRST MURDERER So do not I Go coward as thou art
 Well Ill go hide the body in some hole
 Till that the Duke give order for his burial
 And when I have my meed I will away
 For this will out and then I must not stay Exit

 And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven
 Since I have made my friends at peace on earth

 Dissemble not your hatred swear your love
 RIVERS By heaven my soul is purgd from grudging hate
 And with my hand I seal my true hearts love
 HASTINGS So thrive I as I truly swear the like
 KING EDWARD Take heed you dally not before your king
 Lest He that is the supreme King of kings
 Confound your hidden falsehood and award
 Either of you to be the others end
 HASTINGS So prosper I as I swear perfect love
 RIVERS And I as I love Hastings with my heart
 KING EDWARD Madam yourself is not exempt from this
 Nor you son Dorset Buckingham nor you
 You have been factious one against the other
 Wife love Lord Hastings let him kiss your hand
 And what you do do it unfeignedly
 QUEEN ELIZABETH There Hastings I will never more
 remember
 Our former hatred so thrive I and mine
 KING EDWARD Dorset embrace him Hastings love Lord
 Marquis
 DORSET This interchange of love I here protest
 Upon my part shall be inviolable
 HASTINGS And so swear I They embrace
 KING EDWARD Now princely Buckingham seal thou this
 league
 With thy embracements to my wifes allies
 And make me happy in your unity
 BUCKINGHAM To the QUEEN Whenever Buckingham
 doth turn his hate
 Upon your Grace but with all duteous love
 Doth cherish you and yours God punish me
 With hate in those where I expect most love
 When I have most need to employ a friend
 And most assured that he is a friend
 Deep hollow treacherous and full of guile
 Be he unto me This do I beg of God
 When I am cold in love to you or yours
 They embrace
 KING EDWARD A pleasing cordial princely Buckingham
 Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
 There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
 To make the blessed period of this peace
 BUCKINGHAM And in good time
 Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke

 Enter GLOUCESTER and RATCLIFF

 GLOUCESTER Good morrow to my sovereign king and
 Queen
 And princely peers a happy time of day
 KING EDWARD Happy indeed as we have spent the day
 Gloucester we have done deeds of charity
 Made peace of enmity fair love of hate
 Between these swelling wrongincensed peers
 GLOUCESTER A blessed labour my most sovereign lord
 Among this princely heap if any here
 By false intelligence or wrong surmise
 Hold me a foe
 If I unwittingly or in my rage
 Have aught committed that is hardly borne
 To any in this presence I desire
 To reconcile me to his friendly peace
 Tis death to me to be at enmity
 I hate it and desire all good mens love
 First madam I entreat true peace of you
 Which I will purchase with my duteous service
 Of you my noble cousin Buckingham
 If ever any grudge were lodgd between us
 Of you and you Lord Rivers and of Dorset
 That all without desert have frownd on me
 Of you Lord Woodville and Lord Scales of you
 Dukes earls lords gentlemenindeed of all
 I do not know that Englishman alive
 With whom my soul is any jot at odds
 More than the infant that is born tonight
 I thank my God for my humility
 QUEEN ELIZABETH A holy day shall this be kept hereafter
 I would to God all strifes were well compounded
 My sovereign lord I do beseech your Highness
 To take our brother Clarence to your grace
 GLOUCESTER Why madam have I offred love for this
 To be so flouted in this royal presence
 Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead
 They all start
 You do him injury to scorn his corse
 KING EDWARD Who knows not he is dead Who knows
 he is
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Allseeing heaven what a world is this
 BUCKINGHAM Look I so pale Lord Dorset as the rest
 DORSET Ay my good lord and no man in the presence
 But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
 KING EDWARD Is Clarence dead The order was reversd
 GLOUCESTER But he poor man by your first order died
 And that a winged Mercury did bear
 Some tardy cripple bare the countermand
 That came too lag to see him buried
 God grant that some less noble and less loyal
 Nearer in bloody thoughts an not in blood
 Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did
 And yet go current from suspicion

 Enter DERBY

 DERBY A boon my sovereign for my service done
 KING EDWARD I prithee peace my soul is full of sorrow
 DERBY I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me
 KING EDWARD Then say at once what is it thou requests
 DERBY The forfeit sovereign of my servants life
 Who slew today a riotous gentleman
 Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk
 KING EDWARD Have I a tongue to doom my brothers death
 And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave
 My brother killed no manhis fault was thought
 And yet his punishment was bitter death
 Who sued to me for him Who in my wrath
 Kneeld at my feet and bid me be advisd
 Who spoke of brotherhood Who spoke of love
 Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
 The mighty Warwick and did fight for me
 Who told me in the field at Tewksbury
 When Oxford had me down he rescued me
 And said Dear Brother live and be a king
 Who told me when we both lay in the field
 Frozen almost to death how he did lap me
 Even in his garments and did give himself
 All thin and naked to the numb cold night
 All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
 Sinfully pluckd and not a man of you
 Had so much grace to put it in my mind
 But when your carters or your waitingvassals
 Have done a drunken slaughter and defacd
 The precious image of our dear Redeemer
 You straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
 And I unjustly too must grant it you DERBY rises
 But for my brother not a man would speak
 Nor I ungracious speak unto myself
 For him poor soul The proudest of you all
 Have been beholding to him in his life
 Yet none of you would once beg for his life
 O God I fear thy justice will take hold
 On me and you and mine and yours for this
 Come Hastings help me to my closet Ah poor Clarence
 Exeunt some with KING and QUEEN
 GLOUCESTER This is the fruits of rashness Markd you not
 How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
 Lookd pale when they did hear of Clarence death
 O they did urge it still unto the King
 God will revenge it Come lords will you go
 To comfort Edward with our company
 BUCKINGHAM We wait upon your Grace Exeunt




SCENE 2

London The palace

Enter the old DUCHESS OF YORK with the SON and DAUGHTER of
CLARENCE

 SON Good grandam tell us is our father dead
 DUCHESS No boy
 DAUGHTER Why do you weep so oft and beat your breast
 And cry O Clarence my unhappy son
 SON Why do you look on us and shake your head
 And call us orphans wretches castaways
 If that our noble father were alive
 DUCHESS My pretty cousins you mistake me both
 I do lament the sickness of the King
 As loath to lose him not your fathers death
 It were lost sorrow to wail one thats lost
 SON Then you conclude my grandam he is dead
 The King mine uncle is to blame for it
 God will revenge it whom I will importune
 With earnest prayers all to that effect
 DAUGHTER And so will I
 DUCHESS Peace children peace The King doth love you
 well
 Incapable and shallow innocents
 You cannot guess who causd your fathers death
 SON Grandam we can for my good uncle Gloucester
 Told me the King provokd to it by the Queen
 Devisd impeachments to imprison him
 And when my uncle told me so he wept
 And pitied me and kindly kissd my cheek
 Bade me rely on him as on my father
 And he would love me dearly as a child
 DUCHESS Ah that deceit should steal such gentle shape
 And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice
 He is my son ay and therein my shame
 Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
 SON Think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
 DUCHESS Ay boy
 SON I cannot think it Hark what noise is this

 Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH with her hair about her
 ears RIVERS and DORSET after her

 QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah who shall hinder me to wail and
 weep
 To chide my fortune and torment myself
 Ill join with black despair against my soul
 And to myself become an enemy
 DUCHESS What means this scene of rude impatience
 QUEEN ELIZABETH To make an act of tragic violence
 EDWARD my lord thy son our king is dead
 Why grow the branches when the root is gone
 Why wither not the leaves that want their sap
 If you will live lament if die be brief
 That our swiftwinged souls may catch the Kings
 Or like obedient subjects follow him
 To his new kingdom of neerchanging night
 DUCHESS Ah so much interest have I in thy sorrow
 As I had title in thy noble husband
 I have bewept a worthy husbands death
 And livd with looking on his images
 But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
 Are crackd in pieces by malignant death
 And I for comfort have but one false glass
 That grieves me when I see my shame in him
 Thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
 And hast the comfort of thy children left
 But death hath snatchd my husband from mine arms
 And pluckd two crutches from my feeble hands
 Clarence and Edward O what cause have I
 Thine being but a moiety of my moan
 To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries
 SON Ah aunt you wept not for our fathers death
 How can we aid you with our kindred tears
 DAUGHTER Our fatherless distress was left unmoand
 Your widowdolour likewise be unwept
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Give me no help in lamentation
 I am not barren to bring forth complaints
 All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
 That I being governd by the watery moon
 May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
 Ah for my husband for my dear Lord Edward
 CHILDREN Ah for our father for our dear Lord Clarence
 DUCHESS Alas for both both mine Edward and Clarence
 QUEEN ELIZABETH What stay had I but Edward and hes
 gone
 CHILDREN What stay had we but Clarence and hes gone
 DUCHESS What stays had I but they and they are gone
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Was never widow had so dear a loss
 CHILDREN Were never orphans had so dear a loss
 DUCHESS Was never mother had so dear a loss
 Alas I am the mother of these griefs
 Their woes are parcelld mine is general
 She for an Edward weeps and so do I
 I for a Clarence weep so doth not she
 These babes for Clarence weep and so do I
 I for an Edward weep so do not they
 Alas you three on me threefold distressd
 Pour all your tears I am your sorrows nurse
 And I will pamper it with lamentation
 DORSET Comfort dear mother God is much displeasd
 That you take with unthankfulness his doing
 In common worldly things tis called ungrateful
 With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
 Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
 Much more to be thus opposite with heaven
 For it requires the royal debt it lent you
 RIVERS Madam bethink you like a careful mother
 Of the young prince your son Send straight for him
 Let him be crownd in him your comfort lives
 Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edwards grave
 And plant your joys in living Edwards throne

 Enter GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM DERBY
 HASTINGS and RATCLIFF

 GLOUCESTER Sister have comfort All of us have cause
 To wail the dimming of our shining star
 But none can help our harms by wailing them
 Madam my mother I do cry you mercy
 I did not see your Grace Humbly on my knee
 I crave your blessing
 DUCHESS God bless thee and put meekness in thy breast
 Love charity obedience and true duty
 GLOUCESTER Amen Aside And make me die a good old
 man
 That is the butt end of a mothers blessing
 I marvel that her Grace did leave it out
 BUCKINGHAM You cloudy princes and heartsorrowing
 peers
 That bear this heavy mutual load of moan
 Now cheer each other in each others love
 Though we have spent our harvest of this king
 We are to reap the harvest of his son
 The broken rancour of your highswoln hearts
 But lately splinterd knit and joind together
 Must gently be preservd cherishd and kept
 Me seemeth good that with some little train
 Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet
 Hither to London to be crownd our King

 RIVERS Why with some little train my Lord of
 Buckingham
 BUCKINGHAM Marry my lord lest by a multitude
 The newheald wound of malice should break out
 Which would be so much the more dangerous
 By how much the estate is green and yet ungovernd
 Where every horse bears his commanding rein
 And may direct his course as please himself
 As well the fear of harm as harm apparent
 In my opinion ought to be prevented
 GLOUCESTER I hope the King made peace with all of us
 And the compact is firm and true in me
 RIVERS And so in me and so I think in all
 Yet since it is but green it should be put
 To no apparent likelihood of breach
 Which haply by much company might be urgd
 Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
 That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince
 HASTINGS And so say I
 GLOUCESTER Then be it so and go we to determine
 Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow
 Madam and you my sister will you go
 To give your censures in this business
 Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
 BUCKINGHAM My lord whoever journeys to the Prince
 For Gods sake let not us two stay at home
 For by the way Ill sort occasion
 As index to the story we late talkd of
 To part the Queens proud kindred from the Prince
 GLOUCESTER My other self my counsels consistory
 My oracle my prophet my dear cousin
 I as a child will go by thy direction
 Toward Ludlow then for well not stay behind Exeunt




SCENE 3

London A street

Enter one CITIZEN at one door and another at the other

 FIRST CITIZEN Good morrow neighbour Whither away so
 fast
 SECOND CITIZEN I promise you I scarcely know myself
 Hear you the news abroad
 FIRST CITIZEN Yes that the King is dead
 SECOND CITIZEN Ill news byr lady seldom comes the
 better
 I fear I fear twill prove a giddy world

 Enter another CITIZEN

 THIRD CITIZEN Neighbours God speed
 FIRST CITIZEN Give you good morrow sir
 THIRD CITIZEN Doth the news hold of good King Edwards
 death
 SECOND CITIZEN Ay sir it is too true God help the while
 THIRD CITIZEN Then masters look to see a troublous
 world
 FIRST CITIZEN No no by Gods good grace his son shall
 reign
 THIRD CITIZEN Woe to that land thats governd by a child
 SECOND CITIZEN In him there is a hope of government
 Which in his nonage council under him
 And in his full and ripened years himself
 No doubt shall then and till then govern well
 FIRST CITIZEN So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
 Was crownd in Paris but at nine months old
 THIRD CITIZEN Stood the state so No no good friends
 God wot
 For then this land was famously enrichd
 With politic grave counsel then the King
 Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace
 FIRST CITIZEN Why so hath this both by his father and
 mother
 THIRD CITIZEN Better it were they all came by his father
 Or by his father there were none at all
 For emulation who shall now be nearest
 Will touch us all too near if God prevent not
 O full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester
 And the Queens sons and brothers haught and proud
 And were they to be ruld and not to rule
 This sickly land might solace as before
 FIRST CITIZEN Come come we fear the worst all will be
 well
 THIRD CITIZEN When clouds are seen wise men put on
 their cloaks
 When great leaves fall then winter is at hand
 When the sun sets who doth not look for night
 Untimely storms make men expect a dearth
 All may be well but if God sort it so
 Tis more than we deserve or I expect
 SECOND CITIZEN Truly the hearts of men are fun of fear
 You cannot reason almost with a man
 That looks not heavily and fun of dread
 THIRD CITIZEN Before the days of change still is it so
 By a divine instinct mens minds mistrust
 Ensuing danger as by proof we see
 The water swell before a boistrous storm
 But leave it all to God Whither away
 SECOND CITIZEN Marry we were sent for to the justices
 THIRD CITIZEN And so was I Ill bear you company
 Exeunt

 And at Northampton they do rest tonight
 Tomorrow or next day they will be here
 DUCHESS I long with all my heart to see the Prince
 I hope he is much grown since last I saw him
 QUEEN ELIZABETH But I hear no they say my son of York
 Has almost overtaen him in his growth
 YORK Ay mother but I would not have it so
 DUCHESS Why my good cousin it is good to grow
 YORK Grandam one night as we did sit at supper
 My uncle Rivers talkd how I did grow
 More than my brother Ay quoth my uncle Gloucester
 Small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace
 And since methinks I would not grow so fast
 Because sweet flowrs are slow and weeds make haste
 DUCHESS Good faith good faith the saying did not hold
 In him that did object the same to thee
 He was the wretchedst thing when he was young
 So long agrowing and so leisurely
 That if his rule were true he should be gracious
 ARCHBISHOP And so no doubt he is my gracious madam
 DUCHESS I hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
 YORK Now by my troth if I had been remembred
 I could have given my uncles Grace a flout
 To touch his growth nearer than he touchd mine
 DUCHESS How my young York I prithee let me hear it
 YORK Marry they say my uncle grew so fast
 That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
 Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth
 Grandam this would have been a biting jest
 DUCHESS I prithee pretty York who told thee this
 YORK Grandam his nurse
 DUCHESS His nurse Why she was dead ere thou wast
 born
 YORK If twere not she I cannot tell who told me
 QUEEN ELIZABETH A parlous boy Go to you are too

 Why or for what the nobles were committed
 Is all unknown to me my gracious lord
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Ay me I see the ruin of my house
 The tiger now hath seizd the gentle hind
 Insulting tyranny begins to jet
 Upon the innocent and aweless throne
 Welcome destruction blood and massacre
 I see as in a map the end of all
 DUCHESS Accursed and unquiet wrangling days
 How many of you have mine eyes beheld
 My husband lost his life to get the crown
 And often up and down my sons were tossd
 For me to joy and weep their gain and loss
 And being seated and domestic broils
 Clean overblown themselves the conquerors
 Make war upon themselvesbrother to brother
 Blood to blood self against self O preposterous
 And frantic outrage end thy damned spleen
 Or let me die to look on death no more
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Come come my boy we will to
 sanctuary
 Madam farewell
 DUCHESS Stay I will go with you
 QUEEN ELIZABETH You have no cause

ACT III SCENE 1

London A street

The trumpets sound Enter the PRINCE OF WALES GLOUCESTER
BUCKINGHAM
CATESBY CARDINAL BOURCHIER and others

 BUCKINGHAM Welcome sweet Prince to London to your
 chamber
 GLOUCESTER Welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign
 The weary way hath made you melancholy
 PRINCE No uncle but our crosses on the way
 Have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
 I want more uncles here to welcome me
 GLOUCESTER Sweet Prince the untainted virtue of your
 years
 Hath not yet divd into the worlds deceit
 Nor more can you distinguish of a man
 Than of his outward show which God He knows
 Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
 Those uncles which you want were dangerous
 Your Grace attended to their sugred words
 But lookd not on the poison of their hearts
 God keep you from them and from such false friends
 PRINCE God keep me from false friends but they were
 none
 GLOUCESTER My lord the Mayor of London comes to greet
 you

 Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train

 MAYOR God bless your Grace with health and happy days
 PRINCE I thank you good my lord and thank you all
 I thought my mother and my brother York
 Would long ere this have met us on the way
 Fie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not
 To tell us whether they will come or no

 Enter LORD HASTINGS

 BUCKINGHAM And in good time here comes the sweating
 Lord
 PRINCE Welcome my lord What will our mother come
 HASTINGS On what occasion God He knows not I
 The Queen your mother and your brother York
 Have taken sanctuary The tender Prince
 Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace
 But by his mother was perforce withheld
 BUCKINGHAM Fie what an indirect and peevish course
 Is this of hers Lord Cardinal will your Grace
 Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York
 Unto his princely brother presently
 If she deny Lord Hastings go with him
 And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
 CARDINAL My Lord of Buckingham if my weak oratory
 Can from his mother win the Duke of York
 Anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
 To mild entreaties God in heaven forbid
 We should infringe the holy privilege
 Of blessed sanctuary Not for all this land
 Would I be guilty of so deep a sin
 BUCKINGHAM You are too senselessobstinate my lord
 Too ceremonious and traditional
 Weigh it but with the grossness of this age
 You break not sanctuary in seizing him
 The benefit thereof is always granted
 To those whose dealings have deservd the place
 And those who have the wit to claim the place
 This Prince hath neither claimd it nor deservd it
 And therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
 Then taking him from thence that is not there
 You break no privilege nor charter there
 Oft have I heard of sanctuary men
 But sanctuary children never till now
 CARDINAL My lord you shall oerrule my mind for once
 Come on Lord Hastings will you go with me
 HASTINGS I go my lord
 PRINCE Good lords make all the speedy haste you may
 Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS
 Say uncle Gloucester if our brother come
 Where shall we sojourn till our coronation
 GLOUCESTER Where it seems best unto your royal self
 If I may counsel you some day or two
 Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower
 Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
 For your best health and recreation
 PRINCE I do not like the Tower of any place
 Did Julius Caesar build that place my lord
 BUCKINGHAM He did my gracious lord begin that place
 Which since succeeding ages have reedified
 PRINCE Is it upon record or else reported
 Successively from age to age he built it
 BUCKINGHAM Upon record my gracious lord
 PRINCE But say my lord it were not registred
 Methinks the truth should live from age to age
 As twere retaild to all posterity
 Even to the general allending day
 GLOUCESTER Aside So wise so young they say do never
 live long
 PRINCE What say you uncle
 GLOUCESTER I say without characters fame lives long
 Aside Thus like the formal vice Iniquity
 I moralize two meanings in one word
 PRINCE That Julius Caesar was a famous man
 With what his valour did enrich his wit
 His wit set down to make his valour live
 Death makes no conquest of this conqueror
 For now he lives in fame though not in life
 Ill tell you what my cousin Buckingham
 BUCKINGHAM What my gracious lord
 PRINCE An if I live until I be a man
 Ill win our ancient right in France again
 Or die a soldier as I livd a king
 GLOUCESTER Aside Short summers lightly have a forward
 spring

 Enter HASTINGS young YORK and the CARDINAL

 BUCKINGHAM Now in good time here comes the Duke of
 York
 PRINCE Richard of York how fares our loving brother
 YORK Well my dread lord so must I can you now
 PRINCE Ay brother to our grief as it is yours
 Too late he died that might have kept that title
 Which by his death hath lost much majesty
 GLOUCESTER How fares our cousin noble Lord of York
 YORK I thank you gentle uncle O my lord
 You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
 The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far
 GLOUCESTER He hath my lord
 YORK And therefore is he idle
 GLOUCESTER O my fair cousin I must not say so
 YORK Then he is more beholding to you than I
 GLOUCESTER He may command me as my sovereign
 But you have power in me as in a kinsman
 YORK I pray you uncle give me this dagger
 GLOUCESTER My dagger little cousin With all my heart
 PRINCE A beggar brother
 YORK Of my kind uncle that I know will give
 And being but a toy which is no grief to give
 GLOUCESTER A greater gift than that Ill give my cousin
 YORK A greater gift O thats the sword to it
 GLOUCESTER Ay gentle cousin were it light enough
 YORK O then I see you will part but with light gifts
 In weightier things youll say a beggar nay
 GLOUCESTER It is too heavy for your Grace to wear
 YORK I weigh it lightly were it heavier
 GLOUCESTER What would you have my weapon little
 Lord
 YORK I would that I might thank you as you call me
 GLOUCESTER How
 YORK Little
 PRINCE My Lord of York will still be cross in talk
 Uncle your Grace knows how to bear with him
 YORK You mean to bear me not to bear with me
 Uncle my brother mocks both you and me
 Because that I am little like an ape
 He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
 BUCKINGHAM With what a sharpprovided wit he reasons
 To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
 He prettily and aptly taunts himself
 So cunning and so young is wonderful
 GLOUCESTER My lord willt please you pass along
 Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
 Will to your mother to entreat of her
 To meet you at the Tower and welcome you
 YORK What will you go unto the Tower my lord
 PRINCE My Lord Protector needs will have it so
 YORK I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower
 GLOUCESTER Why what should you fear
 YORK Marry my uncle Clarence angry ghost
 My grandam told me he was murderd there
 PRINCE I fear no uncles dead
 GLOUCESTER Nor none that live I hope
 PRINCE An if they live I hope I need not fear
 But come my lord and with a heavy heart
 Thinking on them go I unto the Tower
 A sennet
 Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY
 BUCKINGHAM Think you my lord this little prating York
 Was not incensed by his subtle mother
 To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
 GLOUCESTER No doubt no doubt O tis a perilous boy
 Bold quick ingenious forward capable
 He is all the mothers from the top to toe
 BUCKINGHAM Well let them rest Come hither Catesby
 Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
 As closely to conceal what we impart
 Thou knowst our reasons urgd upon the way
 What thinkst thou Is it not an easy matter
 To make William Lord Hastings of our mind
 For the instalment of this noble Duke
 In the seat royal of this famous isle
 CATESBY He for his fathers sake so loves the Prince
 That he will not be won to aught against him
 BUCKINGHAM What thinkst thou then of Stanley Will
 not he
 CATESBY He will do all in all as Hastings doth
 BUCKINGHAM Well then no more but this go gentle
 Catesby
 And as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings
 How he doth stand affected to our purpose
 And summon him tomorrow to the Tower
 To sit about the coronation
 If thou dost find him tractable to us
 Encourage him and tell him all our reasons
 If he be leaden icy cold unwilling
 Be thou so too and so break off the talk
 And give us notice of his inclination
 For we tomorrow hold divided councils
 Wherein thyself shalt highly be employd
 GLOUCESTER Commend me to Lord William Tell him
 Catesby
 His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
 Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle
 And bid my lord for joy of this good news
 Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more
 BUCKINGHAM Good Catesby go effect this business soundly
 CATESBY My good lords both with all the heed I can
 GLOUCESTER Shall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep
 CATESBY You shall my lord
 GLOUCESTER At Crosby House there shall you find us both
 Exit CATESBY
 BUCKINGHAM Now my lord what shall we do if we
 perceive
 Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots
 GLOUCESTER Chop off his headsomething we will
 determine
 And look when I am King claim thou of me
 The earldom of Hereford and all the movables
 Whereof the King my brother was possessd
 BUCKINGHAM Ill claim that promise at your Graces hand
 GLOUCESTER And look to have it yielded with all kindness
 Come let us sup betimes that afterwards
 We may digest our complots in some form Exeunt




SCENE 2

Before LORD HASTINGS house

Enter a MESSENGER to the door of HASTINGS

 MESSENGER My lord my lord Knocking
 HASTINGS Within Who knocks
 MESSENGER One from the Lord Stanley
 HASTINGS Within What ist oclock
 MESSENGER Upon the stroke of four

 Enter LORD HASTINGS

 HASTINGS Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious
 nights
 MESSENGER So it appears by that I have to say
 First he commends him to your noble self
 HASTINGS What then
 MESSENGER Then certifies your lordship that this night
 He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm
 Besides he says there are two councils kept
 And that may be determind at the one
 Which may make you and him to rue at th other
 Therefore he sends to know your lordships pleasure
 If you will presently take horse with him
 And with all speed post with him toward the north
 To shun the danger that his soul divines
 HASTINGS Go fellow go return unto thy lord
 Bid him not fear the separated council
 His honour and myself are at the one
 And at the other is my good friend Catesby
 Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
 Whereof I shall not have intelligence
 Tell him his fears are shallow without instance
 And for his dreams I wonder hes so simple
 To trust the mockry of unquiet slumbers
 To fly the boar before the boar pursues
 Were to incense the boar to follow us
 And make pursuit where he did mean no chase
 Go bid thy master rise and come to me
 And we will both together to the Tower
 Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly
 MESSENGER Ill go my lord and tell him what you say
 Exit

 Enter CATESBY

 CATESBY Many good morrows to my noble lord
 HASTINGS Good morrow Catesby you are early stirring
 What news what news in this our tottring state
 CATESBY It is a reeling world indeed my lord
 And I believe will never stand upright
 Till Richard wear the garland of the realm
 HASTINGS How wear the garland Dost thou mean the
 crown
 CATESBY Ay my good lord
 HASTINGS Ill have this crown of mine cut from my
 shoulders
 Before Ill see the crown so foul misplacd
 But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
 CATESBY Ay on my life and hopes to find you forward
 Upon his party for the gain thereof
 And thereupon he sends you this good news
 That this same very day your enemies
 The kindred of the Queen must die at Pomfret
 HASTINGS Indeed I am no mourner for that news
 Because they have been still my adversaries
 But that Ill give my voice on Richards side
 To bar my masters heirs in true descent
 God knows I will not do it to the death
 CATESBY God keep your lordship in that gracious mind
 HASTINGS But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence
 That they which brought me in my masters hate
 I live to look upon their tragedy
 Well Catesby ere a fortnight make me older
 Ill send some packing that yet think not ont
 CATESBY Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
 When men are unprepard and look not for it
 HASTINGS O monstrous monstrous And so falls it out
 With Rivers Vaughan Grey and so twill do
 With some men else that think themselves as safe
 As thou and I who as thou knowest are dear
 To princely Richard and to Buckingham
 CATESBY The Princes both make high account of you
 Aside For they account his head upon the bridge
 HASTINGS I know they do and I have well deservd it

 Enter LORD STANLEY

 Come on come on where is your boarspear man
 Fear you the boar and go so unprovided
 STANLEY My lord good morrow good morrow Catesby
 You may jest on but by the holy rood
 I do not like these several councils I
 HASTINGS My lord I hold my life as dear as yours
 And never in my days I do protest
 Was it so precious to me as tis now
 Think you but that I know our state secure
 I would be so triumphant as I am
 STANLEY The lords at Pomfret when they rode from
 London
 Were jocund and supposd their states were sure
 And they indeed had no cause to mistrust
 But yet you see how soon the day oercast
 This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt
 Pray God I say I prove a needless coward
 What shall we toward the Tower The day is spent
 HASTINGS Come come have with you Wot you what my
 Lord
 Today the lords you talkd of are beheaded
 STANLEY They for their truth might better wear their
 heads
 Than some that have accusd them wear their hats
 But come my lord lets away

 Enter HASTINGS a pursuivant

 HASTINGS Go on before Ill talk with this good fellow
 Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY
 How now Hastings How goes the world with thee
 PURSUIVANT The better that your lordship please to ask
 HASTINGS I tell thee man tis better with me now
 Than when thou metst me last where now we meet
 Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
 By the suggestion of the Queens allies
 But now I tell theekeep it to thyself
 This day those enernies are put to death
 And I in better state than eer I was
 PURSUIVANT God hold it to your honours good content
 HASTINGS Gramercy Hastings there drink that for me
 Throws him his purse
 PURSUIVANT I thank your honour Exit

 Lord Hastings you and he are near in love
 HASTINGS I thank his Grace I know he loves me well
 But for his purpose in the coronation
 I have not sounded him nor he deliverd
 His gracious pleasure any way therein
 But you my honourable lords may name the time
 And in the Dukes behalf Ill give my voice
 Which I presume hell take in gentle part

 Enter GLOUCESTER

 BISHOP OF ELY In happy time here comes the Duke himself
 GLOUCESTER My noble lords and cousins all good morrow
 I have been long a sleeper but I trust
 My absence doth neglect no great design
 Which by my presence might have been concluded
 BUCKINGHAM Had you not come upon your cue my lord
 WILLIAM Lord Hastings had pronouncd your part
 I mean your voice for crowning of the King
 GLOUCESTER Than my Lord Hastings no man might be
 bolder
 His lordship knows me well and loves me well
 My lord of Ely when I was last in Holborn
 I saw good strawberries in your garden there
 I do beseech you send for some of them
 BISHOP of ELY Marry and will my lord with all my heart
 Exit
 GLOUCESTER Cousin of Buckingham a word with you
 Takes him aside
 Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business
 And finds the testy gentleman so hot
 That he will lose his head ere give consent
 His masters child as worshipfully he terms it
 Shall lose the royalty of Englands throne
 BUCKINGHAM Withdraw yourself awhile Ill go with you
 Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
 DERBY We have not yet set down this day of triumph
 Tomorrow in my judgment is too sudden
 For I myself am not so well provided
 As else I would be were the day prolongd

 Reenter the BISHOP OF ELY

 BISHOP OF ELY Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester
 I have sent for these strawberries
 HASTINGS His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this
 morning
 Theres some conceit or other likes him well
 When that he bids good morrow with such spirit
 I think theres never a man in Christendom
 Can lesser hide his love or hate than he
 For by his face straight shall you know his heart
 DERBY What of his heart perceive you in his face
 By any livelihood he showd today
 HASTINGS Marry that with no man here he is offended
 For were he he had shown it in his looks

 Reenter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM

 GLOUCESTER I pray you all tell me what they deserve
 That do conspire my death with devilish plots
 Of damned witchcraft and that have prevaild
 Upon my body with their hellish charms
 HASTINGS The tender love I bear your Grace my lord
 Makes me most forward in this princely presence
 To doom th offenders whosoeer they be
 I say my lord they have deserved death
 GLOUCESTER Then be your eyes the witness of their evil
 Look how I am bewitchd behold mine arm
 Is like a blasted sapling witherd up
 And this is Edwards wife that monstrous witch
 Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore
 That by their witchcraft thus have marked me
 HASTINGS If they have done this deed my noble lord
 GLOUCESTER Ifthou protector of this damned strumpet
 Talkst thou to me of ifs Thou art a traitor
 Off with his head Now by Saint Paul I swear
 I will not dine until I see the same
 Lovel and Ratcliff look that it be done
 The rest that love me rise and follow me
 Exeunt all but HASTINGS LOVEL and RATCLIFF
 HASTINGS Woe woe for England not a whit for me
 For I too fond might have prevented this
 STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms
 And I did scorn it and disdain to fly
 Three times today my footcloth horse did stumble
 And started when he lookd upon the Tower
 As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse
 O now I need the priest that spake to me
 I now repent I told the pursuivant
 As too triumphing how mine enemies
 Today at Pomfret bloodily were butcherd
 And I myself secure in grace and favour
 O Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse
 Is lighted on poor Hastings wretched head
 RATCLIFF Come come dispatch the Duke would be at
 dinner
 Make a short shrift he longs to see your head
 HASTINGS O momentary grace of mortal men
 Which we more hunt for than the grace of God
 Who builds his hope in air of your good looks
 Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast
 Ready with every nod to tumble down
 Into the fatal bowels of the deep
 LOVEL Come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim
 HASTINGS O bloody Richard Miserable England
 I prophesy the fearfullst time to thee
 That ever wretched age hath lookd upon
 Come lead me to the block bear him my head
 They smile at me who shortly shall be dead Exeunt




SCENE 5

London The Towerwalls

Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rotten armour marvellous
illfavoured

 GLOUCESTER Come cousin canst thou quake and change
 thy colour
 Murder thy breath in middle of a word
 And then again begin and stop again
 As if thou were distraught and mad with terror
 BUCKINGHAM Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian
 Speak and look back and pry on every side
 Tremble and start at wagging of a straw
 Intending deep suspicion Ghastly looks
 Are at my service like enforced smiles
 And both are ready in their offices
 At any time to grace my stratagems
 But what is Catesby gone
 GLOUCESTER He is and see he brings the mayor along

 Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY

 BUCKINGHAM Lord Mayor
 GLOUCESTER Look to the drawbridge there
 BUCKINGHAM Hark a drum
 GLOUCESTER Catesby oerlook the walls
 BUCKINGHAM Lord Mayor the reason we have sent
 GLOUCESTER Look back defend thee here are enemies
 BUCKINGHAM God and our innocence defend and guard us

 Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF with HASTINGS head

 GLOUCESTER Be patient they are friendsRatcliff and Lovel
 LOVEL Here is the head of that ignoble traitor
 The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings
 GLOUCESTER So dear I lovd the man that I must weep
 I took him for the plainest harmless creature
 That breathd upon the earth a Christian
 Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
 The history of all her secret thoughts
 So smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue
 That his apparent open guilt omitted
 I mean his conversation with Shores wife
 He livd from all attainder of suspects
 BUCKINGHAM Well well he was the covertst sheltred
 traitor
 That ever livd
 Would you imagine or almost believe
 Weret not that by great preservation
 We live to tell itthat the subtle traitor
 This day had plotted in the councilhouse
 To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester
 MAYOR Had he done so
 GLOUCESTER What think you we are Turks or Infidels
 Or that we would against the form of law
 Proceed thus rashly in the villains death
 But that the extreme peril of the case
 The peace of England and our persons safety
 Enforcd us to this execution
 MAYOR Now fair befall you He deservd his death
 And your good Graces both have well proceeded
 To warn false traitors from the like attempts
 I never lookd for better at his hands
 After he once fell in with Mistress Shore
 BUCKINGHAM Yet had we not determind he should die
 Until your lordship came to see his end
 Which now the loving haste of these our friends
 Something against our meanings have prevented
 Because my lord I would have had you heard
 The traitor speak and timorously confess
 The manner and the purpose of his treasons
 That you might well have signified the same
 Unto the citizens who haply may
 Misconster us in him and wail his death
 MAYOR But my good lord your Graces words shall serve
 As well as I had seen and heard him speak
 And do not doubt right noble Princes both
 But Ill acquaint our duteous citizens
 With all your just proceedings in this cause
 GLOUCESTER And to that end we wishd your lordship here
 T avoid the the the censures of the carping world
 BUCKINGHAM Which since you come too late of our intent
 Yet witness what you hear we did intend
 And so my good Lord Mayor we bid farewell
 Exit LORD MAYOR
 GLOUCESTER Go after after cousin Buckingham
 The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post
 There at your meetst advantage of the time
 Infer the bastardy of Edwards children
 Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
 Only for saying he would make his son
 Heir to the crownmeaning indeed his house
 Which by the sign thereof was termed so
 Moreover urge his hateful luxury
 And bestial appetite in change of lust
 Which stretchd unto their servants daughters wives
 Even where his raging eye or savage heart
 Without control lusted to make a prey
 Nay for a need thus far come near my person
 Tell them when that my mother went with child
 Of that insatiate Edward noble York
 My princely father then had wars in France
 And by true computation of the time
 Found that the issue was not his begot
 Which well appeared in his lineaments
 Being nothing like the noble Duke my father
 Yet touch this sparingly as twere far off
 Because my lord you know my mother lives
 BUCKINGHAM Doubt not my lord Ill play the orator
 As if the golden fee for which I plead
 Were for myself and so my lord adieu
 GLOUCESTER If you thrive well bring them to Baynards
 Castle
 Where you shall find me well accompanied
 With reverend fathers and well learned bishops
 BUCKINGHAM I go and towards three or four oclock
 Look for the news that the Guildhall affords Exit
 GLOUCESTER Go Lovel with all speed to Doctor Shaw
 To CATESBY Go thou to Friar Penker Bid them both
 Meet me within this hour at Baynards Castle
 Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
 Now will I go to take some privy order
 To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight
 And to give order that no manner person
 Have any time recourse unto the Princes Exit




SCENE 6

London A street

Enter a SCRIVENER

 SCRIVENER Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings
 Which in a set hand fairly is engrossd
 That it may be today read oer in Pauls
 And mark how well the sequel hangs together
 Eleven hours I have spent to write it over
 For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me
 The precedent was full as long adoing
 And yet within these five hours Hastings livd
 Untainted unexamind free at liberty
 Heres a good world the while Who is so gross
 That cannot see this palpable device
 Yet whos so bold but says he sees it not
 Bad is the world and all will come to nought
 When such ill dealing must be seen in thought Exit




SCENE 7

London Baynards Castle

Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM at several doors

 GLOUCESTER How now how now What say the citizens
 BUCKINGHAM Now by the holy Mother of our Lord
 The citizens are mum say not a word
 GLOUCESTER Touchd you the bastardy of Edwards
 children
 BUCKINGHAM I did with his contract with Lady Lucy
 And his contract by deputy in France
 Th insatiate greediness of his desire
 And his enforcement of the city wives
 His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
 As being got your father then in France
 And his resemblance being not like the Duke
 Withal I did infer your lineaments
 Being the right idea of your father
 Both in your form and nobleness of mind
 Laid open all your victories in Scotland
 Your discipline in war wisdom in peace
 Your bounty virtue fair humility
 Indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose
 Untouchd or slightly handled in discourse
 And when mine oratory drew toward end
 I bid them that did love their countrys good
 Cry God save Richard Englands royal King
 GLOUCESTER And did they so
 BUCKINGHAM No so God help me they spake not a word
 But like dumb statues or breathing stones
 Stard each on other and lookd deadly pale
 Which when I saw I reprehended them
 And askd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence
 His answer was the people were not used
 To be spoke to but by the Recorder
 Then he was urgd to tell my tale again
 Thus saith the Duke thus hath the Duke inferrd
 But nothing spoke in warrant from himself
 When he had done some followers of mine own
 At lower end of the hall hurld up their caps
 And some ten voices cried God save King Richard
 And thus I took the vantage of those few
 Thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth I
 This general applause and cheerful shout
 Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard
 And even here brake off and came away
 GLOUCESTER What tongueless blocks were they Would
 they not speak
 Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come
 BUCKINGHAM The Mayor is here at hand Intend some fear
 Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
 And look you get a prayerbook in your hand
 And stand between two churchmen good my lord
 For on that ground Ill make a holy descant
 And be not easily won to our requests
 Play the maids part still answer nay and take it
 GLOUCESTER I go and if you plead as well for them
 As I can say nay to thee for myself
 No doubt we bring it to a happy issue
 BUCKINGHAM Go go up to the leads the Lord Mayor
 knocks Exit GLOUCESTER

 Enter the LORD MAYOR ALDERMEN and citizens

 Welcome my lord I dance attendance here
 I think the Duke will not be spoke withal

 Enter CATESBY

 Now Catesby what says your lord to my request
 CATESBY He doth entreat your Grace my noble lord
 To visit him tomorrow or next day
 He is within with two right reverend fathers
 Divinely bent to meditation
 And in no worldly suits would he be movd
 To draw him from his holy exercise
 BUCKINGHAM Return good Catesby to the gracious Duke
 Tell him myself the Mayor and Aldermen
 In deep designs in matter of great moment
 No less importing than our general good
 Are come to have some conference with his Grace
 CATESBY Ill signify so much unto him straight Exit
 BUCKINGHAM Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward
 He is not lolling on a lewd lovebed
 But on his knees at meditation
 Not dallying with a brace of courtezans
 But meditating with two deep divines
 Not sleeping to engross his idle body
 But praying to enrich his watchful soul
 Happy were England would this virtuous prince
 Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof
 But sure I fear we shall not win him to it
 MAYOR Marry God defend his Grace should say us nay
 BUCKINGHAM I fear he will Here Catesby comes again

 Reenter CATESBY

 Now Catesby what says his Grace
 CATESBY My lord
 He wonders to what end you have assembled
 Such troops of citizens to come to him
 His Grace not being warnd thereof before
 He fears my lord you mean no good to him
 BUCKINGHAM Sorry I am my noble cousin should
 Suspect me that I mean no good to him
 By heaven we come to him in perfect love
 And so once more return and tell his Grace
 Exit CATESBY
 When holy and devout religious men
 Are at their beads tis much to draw them thence
 So sweet is zealous contemplation

 Enter GLOUCESTER aloft between two BISHOPS
 CATESBY returns

 MAYOR See where his Grace stands tween two clergymen
 BUCKINGHAM Two props of virtue for a Christian prince
 To stay him from the fall of vanity
 And see a book of prayer in his hand
 True ornaments to know a holy man
 Famous Plantagenet most gracious Prince
 Lend favourable ear to our requests
 And pardon us the interruption
 Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal
 GLOUCESTER My lord there needs no such apology
 I do beseech your Grace to pardon me
 Who earnest in the service of my God
 Deferrd the visitation of my friends
 But leaving this what is your Graces pleasure
 BUCKINGHAM Even that I hope which pleaseth God above
 And all good men of this ungovernd isle
 GLOUCESTER I do suspect I have done some offence
 That seems disgracious in the citys eye
 And that you come to reprehend my ignorance
 BUCKINGHAM You have my lord Would it might please
 your Grace
 On our entreaties to amend your fault
 GLOUCESTER Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land
 BUCKINGHAM Know then it is your fault that you resign
 The supreme seat the throne majestical
 The sceptred office of your ancestors
 Your state of fortune and your due of birth
 The lineal glory of your royal house
 To the corruption of a blemishd stock
 Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
 Which here we waken to our countrys good
 The noble isle doth want her proper limbs
 Her face defacd with scars of infamy
 Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
 And almost shouldred in the swallowing gulf
 Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion
 Which to recure we heartily solicit
 Your gracious self to take on you the charge
 And kingly government of this your land
 Not as protector steward substitute
 Or lowly factor for anothers gain
 But as successively from blood to blood
 Your right of birth your empery your own
 For this consorted with the citizens
 Your very worshipful and loving friends
 And by their vehement instigation
 In this just cause come I to move your Grace
 GLOUCESTER I cannot tell if to depart in silence
 Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
 Best fitteth my degree or your condition
 If not to answer you might haply think
 Tonguetied ambition not replying yielded
 To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
 Which fondly you would here impose on me
 If to reprove you for this suit of yours
 So seasond with your faithful love to me
 Then on the other side I checkd my friends
 Thereforeto speak and to avoid the first
 And then in speaking not to incur the last
 Definitively thus I answer you
 Your love deserves my thanks but my desert
 Unmeritable shuns your high request
 First if all obstacles were cut away
 And that my path were even to the crown
 As the ripe revenue and due of birth
 Yet so much is my poverty of spirit
 So mighty and so many my defects
 That I would rather hide me from my greatness
 Being a bark to brook no mighty sea
 Than in my greatness covet to be hid
 And in the vapour of my glory smotherd
 But God be thankd there is no need of me
 And much I need to help you were there need
 The royal tree hath left us royal fruit
 Which mellowd by the stealing hours of time
 Will well become the seat of majesty
 And make no doubt us happy by his reign
 On him I lay that you would lay on me
 The right and fortune of his happy stars
 Which God defend that I should wring from him
 BUCKINGHAM My lord this argues conscience in your
 Grace
 But the respects thereof are nice and trivial
 All circumstances well considered
 You say that Edward is your brothers son
 So say we too but not by Edwards wife
 For first was he contract to Lady Lucy
 Your mother lives a witness to his vow
 And afterward by substitute betrothd
 To Bona sister to the King of France
 These both put off a poor petitioner
 A carecrazd mother to a many sons
 A beautywaning and distressed widow
 Even in the afternoon of her best days
 Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye
 Seducd the pitch and height of his degree
 To base declension and loathd bigamy
 By her in his unlawful bed he got
 This Edward whom our manners call the Prince
 More bitterly could I expostulate
 Save that for reverence to some alive
 I give a sparing limit to my tongue
 Then good my lord take to your royal self
 This profferd benefit of dignity
 If not to bless us and the land withal
 Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
 From the corruption of abusing times
 Unto a lineal truederived course
 MAYOR Do good my lord your citizens entreat you
 BUCKINGHAM Refuse not mighty lord this profferd love
 CATESBY O make them joyful grant their lawful suit
 GLOUCESTER Alas why would you heap this care on me
 I am unfit for state and majesty
 I do beseech you take it not amiss
 I cannot nor I will not yield to you
 BUCKINGHAM If you refuse itas in love and zeal
 Loath to depose the child your brothers son
 As well we know your tenderness of heart
 And gentle kind effeminate remorse
 Which we have noted in you to your kindred
 And egally indeed to all estates
 Yet know wheer you accept our suit or no
 Your brothers son shall never reign our king
 But we will plant some other in the throne
 To the disgrace and downfall of your house
 And in this resolution here we leave you
 Come citizens Zounds Ill entreat no more
 GLOUCESTER O do not swear my lord of Buckingham
 Exeunt BUCKINGHAM MAYOR and citizens
 CATESBY Call him again sweet Prince accept their suit
 If you deny them all the land will rue it
 GLOUCESTER Will you enforce me to a world of cares
 Call them again I am not made of stones
 But penetrable to your kind entreaties
 Albeit against my conscience and my soul

 Reenter BUCKINGHAM and the rest

 Cousin of Buckingham and sage grave men
 Since you will buckle fortune on my back
 To bear her burden wheer I will or no
 I must have patience to endure the load
 But if black scandal or foulfacd reproach
 Attend the sequel of your imposition
 Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
 From all the impure blots and stains thereof
 For God doth know and you may partly see
 How far I am from the desire of this
 MAYOR God bless your Grace We see it and will say it
 GLOUCESTER In saying so you shall but say the truth
 BUCKINGHAM Then I salute you with this royal title
 Long live King Richard Englands worthy King
 ALL Amen
 BUCKINGHAM Tomorrow may it please you to be crownd
 GLOUCESTER Even when you please for you will have it so
 BUCKINGHAM Tomorrow then we will attend your Grace
 And so most joyfully we take our leave
 GLOUCESTER To the BISHOPS Come let us to our holy
 work again
 Farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends Exeunt

 Enter STANLEY

 STANLEY Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence
 And Ill salute your Grace of York as mother
 And reverend lookeron of two fair queens
 To ANNE Come madam you must straight to
 Westminster
 There to be crowned Richards royal queen
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah cut my lace asunder
 That my pent heart may have some scope to beat
 Or else I swoon with this deadkilling news
 ANNE Despiteful tidings O unpleasing news
 DORSET Be of good cheer mother how fares your Grace
 QUEEN ELIZABETH O Dorset speak not to me get thee
 gone
 Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels
 Thy mothers name is ominous to children
 If thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas
 And live with Richmond from the reach of hell
 Go hie thee hie thee from this slaughterhouse
 Lest thou increase the number of the dead
 And make me die the thrall of Margarets curse
 Nor mother wife nor Englands counted queen
 STANLEY Full of wise care is this your counsel madam
 Take all the swift advantage of the hours
 You shall have letters from me to my son
 In your behalf to meet you on the way
 Be not taen tardy by unwise delay
 DUCHESS O illdispersing wind of misery
 O my accursed womb the bed of death
 A cockatrice hast thou hatchd to the world
 Whose unavoided eye is murderous
 STANLEY Come madam come I in all haste was sent
 ANNE And I with all unwillingness will go
 O would to God that the inclusive verge
 Of golden metal that must round my brow
 Were redhot steel to sear me to the brains
 Anointed let me be with deadly venom
 And die ere men can say God save the Queen
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Go go poor soul I envy not thy glory
 To feed my humour wish thyself no harm
 ANNE No why When he that is my husband now
 Came to me as I followd Henrys corse
 When scarce the blood was well washd from his hands
 Which issued from my other angel husband
 And that dear saint which then I weeping followd
 O when I say I lookd on Richards face
 This was my wish Be thou quoth I accursd
 For making me so young so old a widow
 And when thou wedst let sorrow haunt thy bed
 And be thy wife if any be so mad
 More miserable by the life of thee
 Than thou hast made me by my dear lords death
 Lo ere I can repeat this curse again
 Within so small a time my womans heart
 Grossly grew captive to his honey words
 And provd the subject of mine own souls curse
 Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest
 For never yet one hour in his bed
 Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep
 But with his timorous dreams was still awakd
 Besides he hates me for my father Warwick
 And will no doubt shortly be rid of me
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Poor heart adieu I pity thy complaining
 ANNE No more than with my soul I mourn for yours
 DORSET Farewell thou woeful welcomer of glory
 ANNE Adieu poor soul that takst thy leave of it
 DUCHESS To DORSET Go thou to Richmond and good
 fortune guide thee
 To ANNE Go thou to Richard and good angels tend
 thee To QUEEN ELIZABETH Go thou to sanctuary and good
 thoughts possess thee
 I to my grave where peace and rest lie with me
 Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen
 And each hours joy wreckd with a week of teen
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Stay yet look back with me unto the
 Tower
 Pity you ancient stones those tender babes
 Whom envy hath immurd within your walls
 Rough cradle for such little pretty ones
 Rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
 For tender princes use my babies well
 So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell Exeunt

 The most arch deed of piteous massacre
 That ever yet this land was guilty of
 Dighton and Forrest who I did suborn
 To do this piece of ruthless butchery
 Albeit they were fleshd villains bloody dogs
 Melted with tenderness and mild compassion
 Wept like two children in their deaths sad story
 O thus quoth Dighton lay the gentle babes
 Thus thus quoth Forrest girdling one another
 Within their alabaster innocent arms
 Their lips were four red roses on a stalk
 And in their summer beauty kissd each other
 A book of prayers on their pillow lay
 Which once quoth Forrest almost changd my mind
 But O the devilthere the villain stoppd
 When Dighton thus told on We smothered
 The most replenished sweet work of nature
 That from the prime creation eer she framed
 Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
 They could not speak and so I left them both
 To bear this tidings to the bloody King

 Enter KING RICHARD

 And here he comes All health my sovereign lord
 KING RICHARD Kind Tyrrel am I happy in thy news
 TYRREL If to have done the thing you gave in charge
 Beget your happiness be happy then
 For it is done
 KING RICHARD But didst thou see them dead
 TYRREL I did my lord
 KING RICHARD And buried gentle Tyrrel
 TYRREL The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them
 But where to say the truth I do not know
 KING RICHARD Come to me Tyrrel soon at after supper
 When thou shalt tell the process of their death
 Meantime but think how I may do thee good
 And be inheritor of thy desire
 Farewell till then
 TYRREL I humbly take my leave Exit
 KING RICHARD The son of Clarence have I pent up close
 His daughter meanly have I matchd in marriage
 The sons of Edward sleep in Abrahams bosom
 And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night
 Now for I know the Britaine Richmond aims
 At young Elizabeth my brothers daughter
 And by that knot looks proudly on the crown
 To her go I a jolly thriving wooer

 Enter RATCLIFF

 RATCLIFF My lord
 KING RICHARD Good or bad news that thou comst in so
 bluntly
 RATCLIFF Bad news my lord Morton is fled to Richmond
 And Buckingham backd with the hardy Welshmen
 Is in the field and still his power increaseth
 KING RICHARD Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
 Than Buckingham and his rashlevied strength
 Come I have learnd that fearful commenting
 Is leaden servitor to dull delay
 Delay leads impotent and snailpacd beggary
 Then fiery expedition be my wing
 Joves Mercury and herald for a king
 Go muster men My counsel is my shield
 We must be brief when traitors brave the field Exeunt




SCENE 4

London Before the palace

Enter old QUEEN MARGARET

 QUEEN MARGARET So now prosperity begins to mellow
 And drop into the rotten mouth of death
 Here in these confines slily have I lurkd
 To watch the waning of mine enemies
 A dire induction am I witness to
 And will to France hoping the consequence
 Will prove as bitter black and tragical
 Withdraw thee wretched Margaret Who comes here
 Retires

 Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK

 QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah my poor princes ah my tender
 babes
 My unblown flowers newappearing sweets
 If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
 And be not fixd in doom perpetual
 Hover about me with your airy wings
 And hear your mothers lamentation
 QUEEN MARGARET Hover about her say that right for right
 Hath dimmd your infant morn to aged night
 DUCHESS So many miseries have crazd my voice
 That my woewearied tongue is still and mute
 Edward Plantagenet why art thou dead
 QUEEN MARGARET Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet
 Edward for Edward pays a dying debt
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Wilt thou O God fly from such gentle
 lambs
 And throw them in the entrails of the wolf
 When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
 QUEEN MARGARET When holy Harry died and my sweet
 son
 DUCHESS Dead life blind sight poor mortal living ghost
 Woes scene worlds shame graves due by life usurpd
 Brief abstract and record of tedious days
 Rest thy unrest on Englands lawful earth Sitting down
 Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah that thou wouldst as soon afford a
 grave
 As thou canst yield a melancholy seat
 Then would I hide my bones not rest them here
 Ah who hath any cause to mourn but we
 Sitting down by her
 QUEEN MARGARET Coming forward If ancient sorrow be
 most reverend
 Give mine the benefit of seniory
 And let my griefs frown on the upper hand
 If sorrow can admit society Sitting down with them
 Tell oer your woes again by viewing mine
 I had an Edward till a Richard killd him
 I had a husband till a Richard killd him
 Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killd him
 Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killd him
 DUCHESS I had a Richard too and thou didst kill him
 I had a Rutland too thou holpst to kill him
 QUEEN MARGARET Thou hadst a Clarence too and Richard
 killd him
 From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
 A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death
 That dog that had his teeth before his eyes
 To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood
 That foul defacer of Gods handiwork
 That excellent grand tyrant of the earth
 That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls
 Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
 O upright just and truedisposing God
 How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
 Preys on the issue of his mothers body
 And makes her pewfellow with others moan
 DUCHESS O Harrys wife triumph not in my woes
 God witness with me I have wept for thine
 QUEEN MARGARET Bear with me I am hungry for revenge
 And now I cloy me with beholding it
 Thy Edward he is dead that killd my Edward
 The other Edward dead to quit my Edward
 Young York he is but boot because both they
 Matchd not the high perfection of my loss
 Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbd my Edward
 And the beholders of this frantic play
 Th adulterate Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey
 Untimely smotherd in their dusky graves
 Richard yet lives hells black intelligencer
 Only reservd their factor to buy souls
 And send them thither But at hand at hand
 Ensues his piteous and unpitied end
 Earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
 To have him suddenly conveyd from hence
 Cancel his bond of life dear God I pray
 That I may live and say The dog is dead
 QUEEN ELIZABETH O thou didst prophesy the time would
 come
 That I should wish for thee to help me curse
 That bottled spider that foul bunchbackd toad
 QUEEN MARGARET I Calld thee then vain flourish of my
 fortune
 I calld thee then poor shadow painted queen
 The presentation of but what I was
 The flattering index of a direful pageant
 One heavd ahigh to be hurld down below
 A mother only mockd with two fair babes
 A dream of what thou wast a garish flag
 To be the aim of every dangerous shot
 A sign of dignity a breath a bubble
 A queen in jest only to fill the scene
 Where is thy husband now Where be thy brothers
 Where be thy two sons Wherein dost thou joy
 Who sues and kneels and says God save the Queen
 Where be the bending peers that flattered thee
 Where be the thronging troops that followed thee
 Decline all this and see what now thou art
 For happy wife a most distressed widow
 For joyful mother one that wails the name
 For one being sud to one that humbly sues
 For Queen a very caitiff crownd with care
 For she that scornd at me now scornd of me
 For she being feard of all now fearing one
 For she commanding all obeyd of none
 Thus hath the course of justice whirld about
 And left thee but a very prey to time
 Having no more but thought of what thou wast
 To torture thee the more being what thou art
 Thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
 Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
 Now thy proud neck bears half my burdend yoke
 From which even here I slip my weary head
 And leave the burden of it all on thee
 Farewell Yorks wife and queen of sad mischance
 These English woes shall make me smile in France
 QUEEN ELIZABETH O thou well skilld in curses stay awhile
 And teach me how to curse mine enemies
 QUEEN MARGARET Forbear to sleep the nights and fast the
 days
 Compare dead happiness with living woe
 Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were
 And he that slew them fouler than he is
 Bettring thy loss makes the badcauser worse
 Revolving this will teach thee how to curse
 QUEEN ELIZABETH My words are dull O quicken them
 with thine
 QUEEN MARGARET Thy woes will make them sharp and
 pierce like mine Exit
 DUCHESS Why should calamity be full of words
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Windy attorneys to their client woes
 Airy succeeders of intestate joys
 Poor breathing orators of miseries
 Let them have scope though what they will impart
 Help nothing else yet do they ease the heart
 DUCHESS If so then be not tonguetied Go with me
 And in the breath of bitter words lets smother
 My damned son that thy two sweet sons smotherd
 The trumpet sounds be copious in exclaims

 Enter KING RICHARD and his train marching with
 drums and trumpets

 KING RICHARD Who intercepts me in my expedition
 DUCHESS O she that might have intercepted thee
 By strangling thee in her accursed womb
 From all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Hidest thou that forehead with a golden
 crown
 Wheret should be branded if that right were right
 The slaughter of the Prince that owd that crown
 And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers
 Tell me thou villain slave where are my children
 DUCHESS Thou toad thou toad where is thy brother
 Clarence
 And little Ned Plantagenet his son
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Where is the gentle Rivers Vaughan
 Grey
 DUCHESS Where is kind Hastings
 KING RICHARD A flourish trumpets Strike alarum drums
 Let not the heavens hear these telltale women
 Rail on the Lords anointed Strike I say
 Flourish Alarums
 Either be patient and entreat me fair
 Or with the clamorous report of war
 Thus will I drown your exclamations
 DUCHESS Art thou my son
 KING RICHARD Ay I thank God my father and yourself
 DUCHESS Then patiently hear my impatience
 KING RICHARD Madam I have a touch of your condition
 That cannot brook the accent of reproof
 DUCHESS O let me speak
 KING RICHARD Do then but Ill not hear
 DUCHESS I will be mild and gentle in my words
 KING RICHARD And brief good mother for I am in haste
 DUCHESS Art thou so hasty I have stayd for thee
 God knows in torment and in agony
 KING RICHARD And came I not at last to comfort you
 DUCHESS No by the holy rood thou knowst it well
 Thou camst on earth to make the earth my hell
 A grievous burden was thy birth to me
 Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
 Thy schooldays frightful desprate wild and furious
 Thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
 Thy age confirmd proud subtle sly and bloody
 More mild but yet more harmfulkind in hatred
 What comfortable hour canst thou name
 That ever gracd me with thy company
 KING RICHARD Faith none but Humphrey Hour that calld
 your Grace
 To breakfast once forth of my company
 If I be so disgracious in your eye
 Let me march on and not offend you madam
 Strike up the drum
 DUCHESS I prithee hear me speak
 KING RICHARD You speak too bitterly
 DUCHESS Hear me a word
 For I shall never speak to thee again
 KING RICHARD So
 DUCHESS Either thou wilt die by Gods just ordinance
 Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
 Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
 And never more behold thy face again
 Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse
 Which in the day of battle tire thee more
 Than all the complete armour that thou wearst
 My prayers on the adverse party fight
 And there the little souls of Edwards children
 Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
 And promise them success and victory
 Bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
 Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend Exit
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Though far more cause yet much less
 spirit to curse
 Abides in me I say amen to her
 KING RICHARD Stay madam I must talk a word with you
 QUEEN ELIZABETH I have no moe sons of the royal blood
 For thee to slaughter For my daughters Richard
 They shall be praying nuns not weeping queens
 And therefore level not to hit their lives
 KING RICHARD You have a daughter calld Elizabeth
 Virtuous and fair royal and gracious
 QUEEN ELIZABETH And must she die for this O let her
 live
 And Ill corrupt her manners stain her beauty
 Slander myself as false to Edwards bed
 Throw over her the veil of infamy
 So she may live unscarrd of bleeding slaughter
 I will confess she was not Edwards daughter
 KING RICHARD Wrong not her birth she is a royal
 Princess
 QUEEN ELIZABETH To save her life Ill say she is not so
 KING RICHARD Her life is safest only in her birth
 QUEEN ELIZABETH And only in that safety died her
 brothers
 KING RICHARD Lo at their birth good stars were opposite
 QUEEN ELIZABETH No to their lives ill friends were
 contrary
 KING RICHARD All unavoided is the doom of destiny
 QUEEN ELIZABETH True when avoided grace makes destiny
 My babes were destind to a fairer death
 If grace had blessd thee with a fairer life
 KING RICHARD You speak as if that I had slain my cousins
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Cousins indeed and by their uncle
 cozend
 Of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
 Whose hand soever lancd their tender hearts
 Thy head all indirectly gave direction
 No doubt the murdrous knife was dull and blunt
 Till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart
 To revel in the entrails of my lambs
 But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame
 My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
 Till that my nails were anchord in thine eyes
 And I in such a desprate bay of death
 Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
 Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
 KING RICHARD Madam so thrive I in my enterprise
 And dangerous success of bloody wars
 As I intend more good to you and yours
 Than ever you or yours by me were harmd
 QUEEN ELIZABETH What good is coverd with the face of
 heaven
 To be discoverd that can do me good
 KING RICHARD advancement of your children gentle
 lady
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Up to some scaffold there to lose their
 heads
 KING RICHARD Unto the dignity and height of Fortune
 The high imperial type of this earths glory
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Flatter my sorrow with report of it
 Tell me what state what dignity what honour
 Canst thou demise to any child of mine
 KING RICHARD Even all I haveay and myself and all
 Will I withal endow a child of thine
 So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
 Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
 Which thou supposest I have done to thee
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Be brief lest that the process of thy
 kindness
 Last longer telling than thy kindness date
 KING RICHARD Then know that from my soul I love thy
 daughter
 QUEEN ELIZABETH My daughters mother thinks it with her
 soul
 KING RICHARD What do you think
 QUEEN ELIZABETH That thou dost love my daughter from
 thy soul
 So from thy souls love didst thou love her brothers
 And from my hearts love I do thank thee for it
 KING RICHARD Be not so hasty to confound my meaning
 I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
 And do intend to make her Queen of England
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Well then who dost thou mean shall be
 her king
 KING RICHARD Even he that makes her Queen Who else
 should be
 QUEEN ELIZABETH What thou
 KING RICHARD Even so How think you of it
 QUEEN ELIZABETH How canst thou woo her
 KING RICHARD That would I learn of you
 As one being best acquainted with her humour
 QUEEN ELIZABETH And wilt thou learn of me
 KING RICHARD Madam with all my heart
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Send to her by the man that slew her
 brothers
 A pair of bleeding hearts thereon engrave
 Edward and York Then haply will she weep
 Therefore present to heras sometimes Margaret
 Did to thy father steepd in Rutlands blood
 A handkerchief which say to her did drain
 The purple sap from her sweet brothers body
 And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal
 If this inducement move her not to love
 Send her a letter of thy noble deeds
 Tell her thou madst away her uncle Clarence
 Her uncle Rivers ay and for her sake
 Madst quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne
 KING RICHARD You mock me madam this is not the way
 To win your daughter
 QUEEN ELIZABETH There is no other way
 Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
 And not be Richard that hath done all this
 KING RICHARD Say that I did all this for love of her
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Nay then indeed she cannot choose but
 hate thee
 Having bought love with such a bloody spoil
 KING RICHARD Look what is done cannot be now amended
 Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
 Which afterhours gives leisure to repent
 If I did take the kingdom from your sons
 To make amends Ill give it to your daughter
 If I have killd the issue of your womb
 To quicken your increase I will beget
 Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
 A grandams name is little less in love
 Than is the doating title of a mother
 They are as children but one step below
 Even of your metal of your very blood
 Of all one pain save for a night of groans
 Endurd of her for whom you bid like sorrow
 Your children were vexation to your youth
 But mine shall be a comfort to your age
 The loss you have is but a son being King
 And by that loss your daughter is made Queen
 I cannot make you what amends I would
 Therefore accept such kindness as I can
 Dorset your son that with a fearful soul
 Leads discontented steps in foreign soil
 This fair alliance quickly shall call home
 To high promotions and great dignity
 The King that calls your beauteous daughter wife
 Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother
 Again shall you be mother to a king
 And all the ruins of distressful times
 Repaird with double riches of content
 What we have many goodly days to see
 The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
 Shall come again transformd to orient pearl
 Advantaging their loan with interest
 Of ten times double gain of happiness
 Go then my mother to thy daughter go
 Make bold her bashful years with your experience
 Prepare her ears to hear a wooers tale
 Put in her tender heart th aspiring flame
 Of golden sovereignty acquaint the Princes
 With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
 And when this arm of mine hath chastised
 The petty rebel dullbraind Buckingham
 Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
 And lead thy daughter to a conquerors bed
 To whom I will retail my conquest won
 And she shall be sole victoress Caesars Caesar
 QUEEN ELIZABETH What were I best to say Her fathers
 brother
 Would be her lord Or shall I say her uncle
 Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
 Under what title shall I woo for thee
 That God the law my honour and her love
 Can make seem pleasing to her tender years
 KING RICHARD Infer fair Englands peace by this alliance
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Which she shall purchase with
 stilllasting war
 KING RICHARD Tell her the King that may command
 entreats
 QUEEN ELIZABETH That at her hands which the Kings
 King forbids
 KING RICHARD Say she shall be a high and mighty queen
 QUEEN ELIZABETH To wail the title as her mother doth
 KING RICHARD Say I will love her everlastingly
 QUEEN ELIZABETH But how long shall that title ever last
 KING RICHARD Sweetly in force unto her fair lifes end
 QUEEN ELIZABETH But how long fairly shall her sweet life
 last
 KING RICHARD As long as heaven and nature lengthens it
 QUEEN ELIZABETH As long as hell and Richard likes of it
 KING RICHARD Say I her sovereign am her subject low
 QUEEN ELIZABETH But she your subject loathes such
 sovereignty
 KING RICHARD Be eloquent in my behalf to her
 QUEEN ELIZABETH An honest tale speeds best being plainly
 told
 KING RICHARD Then plainly to her tell my loving tale
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Plain and not honest is too harsh a style
 KING RICHARD Your reasons are too shallow and too quick
 QUEEN ELIZABETH O no my reasons are too deep and
 dead
 Too deep and dead poor infants in their graves
 KING RICHARD Harp not on that string madam that is past
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings
 break
 KING RICHARD Now by my George my garter and my
 crown
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Profand dishonourd and the third
 usurpd
 KING RICHARD I swear
 QUEEN ELIZABETH By nothing for this is no oath
 Thy George profand hath lost his lordly honour
 Thy garter blemishd pawnd his knightly virtue
 Thy crown usurpd disgracd his kingly glory
 If something thou wouldst swear to be believd
 Swear then by something that thou hast not wrongd
 KING RICHARD Then by my self
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Thy self is selfmisusd
 KING RICHARD Now by the world
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Tis full of thy foul wrongs
 KING RICHARD My fathers death
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Thy life hath it dishonourd
 KING RICHARD Why then by God
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Gods wrong is most of all
 If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him
 The unity the King my husband made
 Thou hadst not broken nor my brothers died
 If thou hadst feard to break an oath by Him
 Th imperial metal circling now thy head
 Had gracd the tender temples of my child
 And both the Princes had been breathing here
 Which now two tender bedfellows for dust
 Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms
 What canst thou swear by now
 KING RICHARD The time to come
 QUEEN ELIZABETH That thou hast wronged in the time
 oerpast
 For I myself have many tears to wash
 Hereafter time for time past wrongd by thee
 The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughterd
 Ungovernd youth to wail it in their age
 The parents live whose children thou hast butcherd
 Old barren plants to wail it with their age
 Swear not by time to come for that thou hast
 Misusd ere usd by times illusd oerpast
 KING RICHARD As I intend to prosper and repent
 So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
 Of hostile arms Myself myself confound
 Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours
 Day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest
 Be opposite all planets of good luck
 To my proceedingif with dear hearts love
 Immaculate devotion holy thoughts
 I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
 In her consists my happiness and thine
 Without her follows to myself and thee
 Herself the land and many a Christian soul
 Death desolation ruin and decay
 It cannot be avoided but by this
 It will not be avoided but by this
 Therefore dear motherI must call you so
 Be the attorney of my love to her
 Plead what I will be not what I have been
 Not my deserts but what I will deserve
 Urge the necessity and state of times
 And be not peevishfond in great designs
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I be tempted of the devil thus
 KING RICHARD Ay if the devil tempt you to do good
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I forget myself to be myself
 KING RICHARD Ay if your selfs remembrance wrong
 yourself
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Yet thou didst kill my children
 KING RICHARD But in your daughters womb I bury them
 Where in that nest of spicery they will breed
 Selves of themselves to your recomforture
 QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I go win my daughter to thy will
 KING RICHARD And be a happy mother by the deed
 QUEEN ELIZABETH I go Write to me very shortly
 And you shall understand from me her mind
 KING RICHARD Bear her my true loves kiss and so farewell
 Kissing her Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH
 Relenting fool and shallow changing woman

Salisbury An open place

Enter the SHERIFF and guard with BUCKINGHAM led to execution

 BUCKINGHAM Will not King Richard let me speak with
 him
 SHERIFF No my good lord therefore be patient
 BUCKINGHAM Hastings and Edwards children Grey and
 Rivers
 Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward
 Vaughan and all that have miscarried
 By underhand corrupted foul injustice
 If that your moody discontented souls
 Do through the clouds behold this present hour
 Even for revenge mock my destruction
 This is AllSouls day fellow is it not
 SHERIFF It is my lord
 BUCKINGHAM Why then AllSouls day is my bodys
 doomsday
 This is the day which in King Edwards time
 I wishd might fall on me when I was found
 False to his children and his wifes allies
 This is the day wherein I wishd to fall
 By the false faith of him whom most I trusted
 This this AllSouls day to my fearful soul
 Is the determind respite of my wrongs
 That high AllSeer which I dallied with
 Hath turnd my feigned prayer on my head
 And given in earnest what I beggd in jest
 Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men
 To turn their own points in their masters bosoms
 Thus Margarets curse falls heavy on my neck
 When he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow
 Remember Margaret was a prophetess
 Come lead me officers to the block of shame
 Wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame

 Swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough
 In your embowelld bosomsthis foul swine

 Near to the town of Leicester as we learn
 From Tamworth thither is but one days march
 In Gods name cheerly on courageous friends
 To reap the harvest of perpetual peace

 To fight against this guilty homicide

 And ample interchange of sweet discourse

 Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow
 When I should mount with wings of victory
 Once more good night kind lords and gentlemen
 Exeunt all but RICHMOND
 O Thou whose captain I account myself
 Look on my forces with a gracious eye
 Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath
 That they may crush down with a heavy fall
 The usurping helmets of our adversaries
 Make us Thy ministers of chastisement
 That we may praise Thee in the victory
 To Thee I do commend my watchful soul
 Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes
 Sleeping and waking O defend me still Sleeps

 Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh
 What do I fear Myself Theres none else by
 Richard loves Richard that is I am I
 Is there a murderer here Noyes I am
 Then fly What from myself Great reason why
 Lest I revenge What myself upon myself
 Alack I love myself Wherefore For any good
 That I myself have done unto myself
 O no Alas I rather hate myself
 For hateful deeds committed by myself
 I am a villain yet I lie I am not
 Fool of thyself speak well Fool do not flatter
 My conscience hath a thousand several tongues
 And every tongue brings in a several tale
 And every tale condemns me for a villain
 Perjury perjury in the highst degree
 Murder stern murder in the dirst degree
 All several sins all usd in each degree
 Throng to the bar crying all Guilty guilty
 I shall despair There is no creature loves me
 And if I die no soul will pity me
 And wherefore should they since that I myself
 Find in myself no pity to myself
 Methought the souls of all that I had murderd
 Came to my tent and every one did threat
 Tomorrows vengeance on the head of Richard

 What thinkst thouwill our friends prove all true
 RATCLIFF No doubt my lord
 KING RICHARD O Ratcliff I fear I fear
 RATCLIFF Nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows
 KING RICHARD By the apostle Paul shadows tonight

 Under our tents Ill play the eavesdropper
 To see if any mean to shrink from me Exeunt

 Enter the LORDS to RICHMOND sitting in his tent

 LORDS Good morrow Richmond
 RICHMOND Cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen

 RICHMOND The sweetest sleep and fairestboding dreams
 That ever entred in a drowsy head
 Have I since your departure had my lords
 Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murderd
 Came to my tent and cried on victory
 I promise you my soul is very jocund
 In the remembrance of so fair a dream
 How far into the morning is it lords
 LORDS Upon the stroke of four
 RICHMOND Why then tis time to arm and give direction

 His ORATION to his SOLDIERS

 More than I have said loving countrymen
 The leisure and enforcement of the time
 Forbids to dwell upon yet remember this
 God and our good cause fight upon our side
 The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls
 Like highreard bulwarks stand before our faces
 Richard except those whom we fight against
 Had rather have us win than him they follow
 For what is he they follow Truly gentlemen
 A bloody tyrant and a homicide
 One raisd in blood and one in blood establishd
 One that made means to come by what he hath
 And slaughtered those that were the means to help him
 A base foul stone made precious by the foil
 Of Englands chair where he is falsely set
 One that hath ever been Gods enemy
 Then if you fight against Gods enemy
 God will in justice ward you as his soldiers
 If you do sweat to put a tyrant down
 You sleep in peace the tyrant being slain
 If you do fight against your countrys foes
 Your countrys foes shall pay your pains the hire
 If you do fight in safeguard of your wives
 Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors
 If you do free your children from the sword
 Your childrens children quits it in your age
 Then in the name of God and all these rights
 Advance your standards draw your willing swords
 For me the ransom of my bold attempt
 Shall be this cold corpse on the earths cold face
 But if I thrive the gain of my attempt
 The least of you shall share his part thereof
 Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully
 God and Saint George Richmond and victory Exeunt

 Reenter KING RICHARD RATCLIFF attendants
 and forces

 KING RICHARD What said Northumberland as touching
 Richmond
 RATCLIFF That he was never trained up in arms
 KING RICHARD He said the truth and what said Surrey

 RATCLIFF He smild and said The better for our purpose
 KING He was in the right and so indeed it is
 Clock strikes
 Tell the clock there Give me a calendar
 Who saw the sun today
 RATCLIFF Not I my lord
 KING RICHARD Then he disdains to shine for by the book
 He should have bravd the east an hour ago
 A black day will it be to somebody
 Ratcliff
 RATCLIFF My lord
 KING RICHARD The sun will not be seen today
 The sky doth frown and lour upon our army
 I would these dewy tears were from the ground
 Not shine today Why what is that to me
 More than to Richmond For the selfsame heaven
 That frowns on me looks sadly upon him

 Enter NORFOLK

 NORFOLK Arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field
 KING RICHARD Come bustle bustle caparison my horse
 Call up Lord Stanley bid him bring his power
 I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain
 And thus my battle shall be ordered
 My foreward shall be drawn out all in length
 Consisting equally of horse and foot
 Our archers shall be placed in the midst
 John Duke of Norfolk Thomas Earl of Surrey
 Shall have the leading of this foot and horse
 They thus directed we will follow
 In the main battle whose puissance on either side
 Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse
 This and Saint George to boot What thinkst thou
 Norfolk
 NORFOLK A good direction warlike sovereign
 This found I on my tent this morning
 He sheweth him a paper
 KING RICHARD Reads
 Jockey of Norfolk be not so bold
 For Dickon thy master is bought and sold
 A thing devised by the enemy
 Go gentlemen every man unto his charge
 Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls
 Conscience is but a word that cowards use
 Devisd at first to keep the strong in awe
 Our strong arms be our conscience swords our law
 March on join bravely let us to it pellmell
 If not to heaven then hand in hand to hell

 His ORATION to his ARMY

 What shall I say more than I have inferrd
 Remember whom you are to cope withal
 A sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways
 A scum of Britaines and base lackey peasants
 Whom their oercloyed country vomits forth
 To desperate adventures and assurd destruction
 You sleeping safe they bring to you unrest
 You having lands and blessd with beauteous wives
 They would restrain the one distain the other
 And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow
 Long kept in Britaine at our mothers cost
 A milksop one that never in his life
 Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow
 Lets whip these stragglers oer the seas again
 Lash hence these overweening rags of France
 These famishd beggars weary of their lives
 Who but for dreaming on this fond exploit
 For want of means poor rats had hangd themselves
 If we be conquered let men conquer us
 And not these bastard Britaines whom our fathers
 Have in their own land beaten bobbd and thumpd
 And in record left them the heirs of shame
 Shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives
 Ravish our daughters Drum afar off Hark I hear their
 drum
 Fight gentlemen of England Fight bold yeomen
 Draw archers draw your arrows to the head
 Spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood
 Amaze the welkin with your broken staves

 Enter a MESSENGER

 What says Lord Stanley Will he bring his power
 MESSENGER My lord he doth deny to come
 KING RICHARD Off with his son Georges head
 NORFOLK My lord the enemy is passd the marsh
 After the battle let George Stanley die
 KING RICHARD A thousand hearts are great within my
 bosom
 Advance our standards set upon our foes
 Our ancient word of courage fair Saint George
 Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons
 Upon them Victory sits on our helms Exeunt




SCENE 4

Another part of the field

Alarum excursions Enter NORFOLK and forces to him CATESBY

 CATESBY Rescue my Lord of Norfolk rescue rescue
 The King enacts more wonders than a man
 Daring an opposite to every danger
 His horse is slain and all on foot he fights
 Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death
 Rescue fair lord or else the day is lost

 Alarums Enter KING RICHARD

 KING RICHARD A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
 CATESBY Withdraw my lord Ill help you to a horse
 KING RICHARD Slave I have set my life upon a cast
 And I Will stand the hazard of the die

 Five have I slain today instead of him
 A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse Exeunt




SCENE 5

Another part of the field

Alarum Enter RICHARD and RICHMOND they fight RICHARD is slain
Retreat and flourish Enter RICHMOND DERBY bearing the crown
with other LORDS

 RICHMOND God and your arms be praisd victorious friends
 The day is ours the bloody dog is dead
 DERBY Courageous Richmond well hast thou acquit thee
 Lo here this longusurped royalty
 From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
 Have I pluckd off to grace thy brows withal
 Wear it enjoy it and make much of it
 RICHMOND Great God of heaven say Amen to all
 But teLL me is young George Stanley living
 DERBY He is my lord and safe in Leicester town
 Whither if it please you we may now withdraw us
 RICHMOND What men of name are slain on either side
 DERBY John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers
 Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon
 RICHMOND Inter their bodies as becomes their births
 Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
 That in submission will return to us
 And then as we have taen the sacrament
 We will unite the white rose and the red
 Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction
 That long have frownd upon their emnity
 What traitor hears me and says not Amen
 England hath long been mad and scarrd herself
 The brother blindly shed the brothers blood
 The father rashly slaughterd his own son
 The son compelld been butcher to the sire
 All this divided York and Lancaster
 Divided in their dire division
 O now let Richmond and Elizabeth
 The true succeeders of each royal house
 By Gods fair ordinance conjoin together
 And let their heirs God if thy will be so
 Enrich the time to come with smoothfacd peace
 With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
 Abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord
 That would reduce these bloody days again
 And make poor England weep in streams of blood
 Let them not live to taste this lands increase
 That would with treason wound this fair lands peace
 Now civil wounds are stoppd peace lives again
 That she may long live here God say Amen Exeunt
