THE DIARY OF AN OLD SOUL





JANUARY

 1

 LORD what I once had done with youthful might
 Had I been from the first true to the truth
 Grant me now old to dowith better sight
 And humbler heart if not the brain of youth
 So wilt thou in thy gentleness and ruth
 Lead back thy old soul by the path of pain
 Round to his bestyoung eyes and heart and brain

 2

 A dim aurora rises in my east
 Beyond the line of jagged questions hoar
 As if the head of our intombed High Priest
 Began to glow behind the unopened door
 Sure the gold wings will soon rise from the gray
 They rise not Up I rise press on the more
 To meet the slow coming of the Masters day

 3

 Sometimes I wake and lo I have forgot
 And drifted out upon an ebbing sea
 My soul that was at rest now resteth not
 For I am with myself and not with thee
 Truth seems a blind moon in a glaring morn
 Where nothing is but sickheart vanity
 Oh thou who knowest save thy child forlorn

 4

 Death like high faith levelling lifteth all
 When I awake my daughter and my son
 Grown sister and brother in my arms shall fall
 Tenfold my girl and boy Sure every one
 Of all the brood to the old wings will run
 Wholehearted is my worship of the man
 From whom my earthly history began

 5

 Thy fishes breathe but where thy waters roll
 Thy birds fly but within thy airy sea
 My soul breathes only in thy infinite soul
 I breathe I think I love I live but thee
 Oh breathe oh thinkO Love live into me
 Unworthy is my life till all divine
 Till thou see in me only what is thine

 6

 Then shall I breathe in sweetest sharing then
 Think in harmonious consort with my kin
 Then shall I love well all my fathers men
 Feel one with theirs the life my heart within
 Oh brothers sisters holy hearts divine
 Then I shall be all yours and nothing mine
 To every human heart a mothertwin

 7

 I see a child before an empty house
 Knocking and knocking at the closed door
 He wakes dull echoesbut nor man nor mouse
 If he stood knocking there for evermore
 A mother angel see folding each wing
 Softwalking crosses straight the empty floor
 And opens to the obstinate praying thing

 8

 Were there but some deep holy spell whereby
 Always I should remember theesome mode
 Of feeling the pure heatthrob momently
 Of the spiritfire still uttering this I
 Lord see thou to it take thou remembrance load
 Only when I bethink me can I cry
 Remember thou and prick me with loves goad

 9

 If to myselfGod sometimes interferes
 I said my faith at once would be struck blind
 I see him all in all the lifing mind
 Or nowhere in the vacant miles and years
 A love he is that watches and that hears
 Or but a mist fumed up from minds of men
 Whose fear and hope reach out beyond their ken

 10

 When I no more can stir my soul to move
 And life is but the ashes of a fire
 When I can but remember that my heart
 Once used to live and love long and aspire
 Oh be thou then the first the one thou art
 Be thou the calling before all answering love
 And in me wake hope fear boundless desire

 11

 I thought that I had lost thee but behold
 Thou comest to me from the horizon low
 Across the fields outspread of green and gold
 Fair carpet for thy feet to come and go
 Whence I know not or how to me thou art come
 Not less my spirit with calm bliss doth glow
 Meeting thee only thus in nature vague and dumb

 12

 Doubt swells and surges with swelling doubt behind
 My soul in storm is but a tattered sail
 Streaming its ribbons on the torrent gale
 In calm tis but a limp and flapping thing
 Oh swell it with thy breath make it a wing
 To sweep through thee the ocean with thee the wind
 Nor rest until in thee its haven it shall find

 13

 The idle flapping of the sail is doubt
 Faith swells it full to breast the breasting seas
 Bold conscience fast and rule the ruling helm
 Hells freezing north no tempest can send out
 But it shall toss thee homeward to thy leas
 Boisterous wavecrest never shall oerwhelm
 Thy seafloat bark as safe as fieldborne rooted elm

 14

 Sometimes hardtrying it seems I cannot pray
 For doubt and pain and anger and all strife
 Yet some poor halffledged prayerbird from the nest
 May fall flit fly perchcrouch in the bowery breast
 Of the large nationhealing tree of life
 Moveless there sit through all the burning day
 And on my heart at night a fresh leaf cooling lay

 15

 My harvest withers Health my means to live
 All things seem rushing straight into the dark
 But the dark still is God I would not give
 The smallest silverpiece to turn the rush
 Backward or sideways Am I not a spark
 Of him who is the lightFair hope doth flush
 My eastDivine successOh hush and hark

 16

 Thy will be done I yield up everything
 The life is more than meatthen more than health
 The body more than raimentthen than wealth
 The hairs I made not thou art numbering
 Thou art my lifeI the brook thou the spring
 Because thine eyes are open I can see
 Because thou art thyself tis therefore I am me

 17

 No sickness can come near to blast my health
 My life depends not upon any meat
 My bread comes not from any human tilth
 No wings will grow upon my changeless wealth
 Wrong cannot touch it violence or deceit
 Thou art my life my health my bank my barn
 And from all other gods thou plain dost warn

 18

 Care thou for mine whom I must leave behind
 Care that they know who tis for them takes care
 Thy present patience help them still to bear
 Lord keep them clearing growing heart and mind
 In one thy oneness us together bind
 Last earthly prayer with which to thee I cling
 Grant that save love we owe not anything

 19

 Tis well for unembodied thought a live
 True house to buildof stubble wood nor hay
 So like bees round the flower by which they thrive
 My thoughts are busy with the informing truth
 And as I build I feed and grow in youth
 Hoping to stand fresh clean and strong and gay
 When up the east comes dawning His great day

 20

 Thy will is truthtis therefore fate the strong
 Would that my will did sweep full swing with thine
 Then harmony with every spheric song
 And conscious power would give sureness divine
 Who thinks to thread thy great laws onward throng
 Is as a fly that creeps his foolish way
 Athwart an engines wheels in smooth resistless play

 21

 Thou in my heart hast planted gardener divine
 A scion of the tree of life it grows
 But not in every wind or weather it blows
 The leaves fall sometimes from the baby tree
 And the lifepower seems melting into pine
 Yet still the sap keeps struggling to the shine
 And the unseen root clings cramplike unto thee

 22

 Do thou my God my spirits weather control
 And as I do not gloom though the day be dun
 Let me not gloom when earthborn vapours roll
 Across the infinite zenith of my soul
 Should sudden brainfrost through the hearts summer run
 Cold weary joyless waste of air and sun
 Thou art my south my summerwind my all my one

 23

 O Life why dost thou close me up in death
 O Health why make me inhabit heaviness
 I ask yet know the sum of this distress
 Panghaunted body soredismayed mind
 Is but the egg that rounds the winged faith
 When that its path into the air shall find
 My heart will follow high above cold rain and wind

 24

 I can no more than lift my weary eyes
 Therefore I lift my weary eyesno more
 But my eyes pull my heart and that before
 Tis well awake knocks where the conscience lies
 Conscience runs quick to the spirits hidden door
 Straightway from every skyward window cries
 Up to the Fathers listening ears arise

 25

 Not in my fancy now I search to find thee
 Not in its loftiest forms would shape or bind thee
 I cry to one whom I can never know
 Filling me with an infinite overflow
 Not to a shape that dwells within my heart
 Clothed in perfections love and truth assigned thee
 But to the God thou knowest that thou art

 26

 Not Lord because I have done well or ill
 Not that my mind looks up to thee cleareyed
 Not that it struggles in fast cerements tied
 Not that I need thee daily sorer still
 Not that I wretched wander from thy will
 Not now for any cause to thee I cry
 But this that thou art thou and here am I

 27

 Yestereve Death came and knocked at my thin door
 I from my window looked the thing I saw
 The shape uncouth I had not seen before
 I was disturbedwith fear in sooth not awe
 Whereof ashamed I instantly did rouse
 My will to seek theeonly to fear the more
 Alas I could not find thee in the house

 28

 I was like Peter when he began to sink
 To thee a new prayer therefore I have got
 That when Death comes in earnest to my door
 Thou wouldst thyself go when the latch doth clink
 And lead him to my room up to my cot
 Then hold thy childs hand hold and leave him not
 Till Death has done with him for evermore

 29

 Till Death has done with himAh leave me then
 And Death has done with me oh nevermore
 He comesand goesto leave me in thy arms
 Nearer thy heart oh nearer than before
 To lay thy child naked newborn again
 Of mother earth crept free through many harms
 Upon thy bosomstill to the very core

 30

 Come to me Lord I will not speculate how
 Nor think at which door I would have thee appear
 Nor put off calling till my floors be swept
 But cry Come Lord come any way come now
 Doors windows I throw wide my head I bow
 And sit like some one who so long has slept
 That he knows nothing till his life draw near

 31

 O Lord I have been talking to the people
 Thoughts wheels have round me whirled a fiery zone
 And the recoil of my words airy ripple
 My heart unheedful has puffed up and blown
 Therefore I cast myself before thee prone
 Lay cool hands on my burning brain and press
 From my weak heart the swelling emptiness





FEBRUARY

 1

 I TO myself have neither power nor worth
 Patience nor love nor anything right good
 My soul is a poor land plenteous in dearth
 Here blades of grass there a small herb for food
 A nothing that would be something if it could
 But if obedience Lord in me do grow
 I shall one day be better than I know

 2

 The worst power of an evil mood is this
 It makes the bastard self seem in the right
 Self self the end the goal of human bliss
 But if the Christself in us be the might
 Of saving God why should I spend my force
 With a dark thing to reason of the light
 Not push it rough aside and hold obedient course

 3

 Back still it comes to this there was a man
 Who said I am the truth the life the way
 Shall I pass on or shall I stop and hear
 Come to the Father but by me none can
 What then is thisam I not also one
 Of those who live in fatherless dismay
 I stand I look I listen I draw near

 4

 My Lord I find that nothing else will do
 But follow where thou goest sit at thy feet
 And where I have thee not still run to meet
 Roses are scentless hopeless are the morns
 Rest is but weakness laughter crackling thorns
 If thou the Truth do not make them the true
 Thou art my life O Christ and nothing else will do

 5

 Thou art herein heaven I know but not from here
 Although thy separate self do not appear
 If I could part the light from out the day
 There I should have thee But thou art too near
 How find thee walking when thou art the way
 Oh present Christ make my eyes keen as stings
 To see thee at their heart the glory even of things

 6

 That thou art nowhere to be found agree
 Wise men whose eyes are but for surfaces
 Men with eyes opened by the second birth
 To whom the seen husk of the unseen is
 Descry thee soul of everything on earth
 Who know thy ends thy means and motions see
 Eyes made for glory soon discover thee

 7

 Thou near then I draw nearerto thy feet
 And sitting in thy shadow look out on the shine
 Ready at thy first word to leave my seat
 Not thee thou goest too From every clod
 Into thy footprint flows the indwelling wine
 And in my daily bread keeneyed I greet
 Its beings heart the very body of God

 8

 Thou wilt interpret life to me and men
 Art nature yea my own souls mysteries
 Bringing truth out clearjoyous to my ken
 Fair as the morn trampling the dull night Then
 The lone hillside shall hear exultant cries
 The joyous see me joy the weeping weep
 The watching smile as Death breathes on me his cold sleep

 9

 I search my heartI search and find no faith
 Hidden He may be in its many folds
 I see him not revealed in all the world
 Dutys firm shape thins to a misty wraith
 No good seems likely To and fro I am hurled
 I have no stay Only obedience holds
 I haste I rise I do the thing he saith

 10

 Thou wouldst not have thy man crushed back to clay
 It must be God thou hast a strength to give
 To him that fain would do what thou dost say
 Else how shall any soul repentant live
 Old griefs and new fears hurrying on dismay
 Let pain be what thou wilt kind and degree
 Only in pain calm thou my heart with thee

 11

 I will not shift my ground like Moabs king
 But from this spot whereon I stand I pray
 From this same barren rock to thee I say
 Lord in my commonness in this very thing
 That haunts my soul with follythrough the clay
 Of this my pitcher see the lamps dim flake
 And hear the blow that would the pitcher break

 12

 Be thou the well by which I lie and rest
 Be thou my tree of life my garden ground
 Be thou my home my fire my chamber blest
 My book of wisdom loved of all the best
 Oh be my friend each day still newer found
 As the eternal days and nights go round
 Nay naythou art my God in whom all loves are bound

 13

 Two things at once thou knowst I cannot think
 When busy with the work thou givest me
 I cannot consciously think then of thee
 Then why when next thou lookest oer the brink
 Of my horizon should my spirit shrink
 Reproached and fearful nor to greet thee run
 Can I be two when I am only one

 14

 My soul must unawares have sunk awry
 Some care poor eagerness ambition of work
 Some old offence that unforgiving did lurk
 Or some selfgratulation soft and sly
 Something not thy sweet will not the good part
 While the homeguard looked out stirred up the old murk
 And so I gloomed away from thee my Heart

 15

 Therefore I make provision ere I begin
 To do the thing thou givest me to do
 PrayingLord wake me oftener lest I sin
 Amidst my work open thine eyes on me
 That I may wake and laugh and know and see
 Then with healed heart afresh catch up the clue
 And singing drop into my work anew

 16

 If I should slow diverge and listless stray
 Into some thought feeling or dream unright
 O Watcher my backsliding soul affray
 Let me not perish of the ghastly blight
 Be thou O Life eternal in me light
 Then merest approach of selfish or impure
 Shall start me up alive awake secure

 17

 Lord I have fallen againa human clod
 Selfish I was and heedless to offend
 Stood on my rights Thy own child would not send
 Away his shreds of nothing for the whole God
 Wretched to thee who savest low I bend
 Give me the power to let my ragrights go
 In the great wind that from thy gulf doth blow

 18

 Keep me from wrath let it seem ever so right
 My wrath will never work thy righteousness
 Up up the hill to the whiter than snowshine
 Help me to climb and dwell in pardons light
 I must be pure as thou or ever less
 Than thy design of metherefore incline
 My heart to take mens wrongs as thou takst mine

 19

 Lord in thy spirits hurricane I pray
 Strip my soul nakeddress it then thy way
 Change for me all my rags to cloth of gold
 Who would not poverty for riches yield
 A hovel sell to buy a treasurefield
 Who would a mess of porridge careful hold
 Against the universes birthright old

 20

 Help me to yield my will in labour even
 Nor toil on toil greedy of doing heap
 Fretting I cannot more than me is given
 That with the finest clay my wheel runs slow
 Nor lets the lovely thing the shapely grow
 That memory what thought gives it cannot keep
 And nightly rimes ere morn like cistuspetals go

 21

 Tisshall thy will be done for meor mine
 And I be made a thing not after thine
 My own and dear in paltriest details
 Shall I be born of God or of mere man
 Be made like Christ or on some other plan
 I let all runset thou and trim my sails
 Home then my course let blow whatever gales

 22

 With thee on board each sailor is a king
 Nor I mere captain of my vessel then
 But heir of earth and heaven eternal child
 Daring all truth nor fearing anything
 Mighty in love the servant of all men
 Resenting nothing taking rage and blare
 Into the Godlike silence of a loving care

 23

 I cannot see my God a reason why
 From morn to night I go not gladsome free
 For if thou art what my soul thinketh thee
 There is no burden but should lightly lie
 No duty but a joy at heart must be
 Loves perfect will can be nor sore nor small
 For God is lightin him no darkness is at all

 24

 Tis something thus to think and half to trust
 But ah my very heart Godborn should lie
 Spread to the light clean clear of mire and rust
 And like a sponge drink the divine sunbeams
 What resolution then strong swift and high
 What pure devotion or to live or die
 And in my sleep what true what perfect dreams

 25

 There is a misty twilight of the soul
 A sickly eclipse low brooding oer a man
 When the poor brain is as an empty bowl
 And the thoughtspirit weariful and wan
 Turning from that which yet it loves the best
 Sinks moveless with lifepoverty opprest
 Watch then O Lord thy feebly glimmering coal

 26

 I cannot think in me is but a void
 I have felt much and want to feel no more
 My soul is hungry for some poorer fare
 Some earthly nectar gold not unalloyed
 The little child thats happy to the core
 Will leave his mothers lap run down the stair
 Play with the servantsis his mother annoyed

 27

 I would not have it so Weary and worn
 Why not to thee run straight and be at rest
 Motherward with toy new or garment torn
 The child that late forsook her changeless breast
 Runs to homes heart the heaven thats heavenliest
 In joy or sorrow feebleness or might
 Peace or commotion be thou Father my delight

 28

 The thing I would say still comes forth with doubt
 And differenceis it that thou shapst my ends
 Or is it only the necessity
 Of stubborn words that shift sluggish about
 Warping my thought as it the sentence bends
 Have thou a part in it O Lord and I
 Shall say a truth if not the thing I try

 29

 Gather my broken fragments to a whole
 As these four quarters make a shining day
 Into thy basket for my golden bowl
 Take up the things that I have cast away
 In vice or indolence or unwise play
 Let mine be a merry allreceiving heart
 But make it a whole with light in every part





MARCH

 1

 THE song birds that come to me night and morn
 Fly oft away and vanish if I sleep
 Nor to my fowlingnet will one return
 Is the thing ever ours we cannot keep
 But their souls go not out into the deep
 What matter if with changed song they come back
 Old strength nor yet fresh beauty shall they lack

 2

 Gloriously wasteful O my Lord art thou
 Sunset faints after sunset into the night
 Splendorously dying from thy windowsill
 For ever Sad our poverty doth bow
 Before the riches of thy making might
 Sweep from thy space thy systems at thy will
 In thee the sun sets every sunset still

 3

 And in the perfect time O perfect God
 When we are in our home our natal home
 When joy shall carry every sacred load
 And from its life and peace no heart shall roam
 What if thou make us able to make like thee
 To light with moons to clothe with greenery
 To hang gold sunsets oer a rose and purple sea

 4

 Then to his neighbour one may call out Come
 Brother come hitherI would show you a thing
 And lo a vision of his imagining
 Informed of thought which else had rested dumb
 Before the neighbours truthdelighted eyes
 In the great aether of existence rise
 And two hearts each to each the closer cling

 5

 We make but thou art the creating core
 Whatever thing I dream invent or feel
 Thou art the heart of it the atmosphere
 Thou art inside all love man ever bore
 Yea the love itself whatever thing be dear
 Man calls his dog he follows at his heel
 Because thou first art love selfcaused essential mere

 6

 This day be with me Lord when I go forth
 Be nearer to me than I am able to ask
 In merriment in converse or in task
 Walking the street listening to men of worth
 Or greeting such as only talk and bask
 Be thy thought still my waiting soul around
 And if He come I shall be watching found

 7

 What if writing I always seem to leave
 Some better thing or better way behind
 Why should I therefore fret at all or grieve
 The worse I drop that I the better find
 The best is only in thy perfect mind
 Fallen threads I will not search forI will weave
 Who makes the millwheel backward strike to grind

 8

 Be with me Lord Keep me beyond all prayers
 For more than all my prayers my need of thee
 And thou beyond all need all unknown cares
 What the hearts dear imagination dares
 Thou dost transcend in measureless majesty
 All prayers in onemy God be unto me
 Thy own eternal self absolutely

 9

 Where should the unknown treasures of the truth
 Lie but there whence the truth comes out the most
 In the Son of man folded in love and ruth
 Fair shore we see fair ocean but behind
 Lie infinite reaches bathing many a coast
 The human thought of the eternal mind
 Pulsed by a living tide blown by a living wind

 10

 Thou healthful Father art the Ancient of Days
 And Jesus is the eternal youth of thee
 Our old age is the scorching of the bush
 By lifes indwelling incorruptible blaze
 O Life burn at this feeble shell of me
 Till I the sore singed garment off shall push
 Flap out my Psyche wings and to thee rush

 11

 But shall I then rush to thee like a dart
 Or lie long hours aeonian yet betwixt
 This hunger in me and the Fathers heart
 It shall be good how ever and not ill
 Of things and thoughts even now thou art my next
 Sole neighbour and no space between thou art
 And yet art drawing nearer nearer still

 12

 Therefore my brothers therefore sisters dear
 However I troubled or selfish fail
 In tenderness or grace or service clear
 I every moment draw to you more near
 God in us from our hearts veil after veil
 Keeps lifting till we see with his own sight
 And all together run in unitys delight

 13

 I love thee Lord for very greed of love
 Not of the precious streams that towards me move
 But of the indwelling outgoing fountain store
 Than mine oh many an ignorant heart loves more
 Therefore the more with Mary at thy feet
 I must sit worshippingthat in my core
 Thy words may fan to a flame the low primeval heat

 14

 Oh my beloved gone to heaven from me
 I would be rich in love to heap you with love
 I long to love you sweet ones perfectly
 Like God who sees no spanning vault above
 No earth below and feels no circling air
 Infinitely no boundary anywhere
 I am a beast until I love as God doth love

 15

 Ah say not tis but perfect self I want
 But if it were that self is fit to live
 Whose perfectness is still itself to scant
 Which never longs to have but still to give
 A self I must have or not be at all
 Love give me a self selfgivingor let me fall
 To endless darkness back and free me from lifes thrall

 16

 Back said I Whither back How to the dark
 From no dark came I but the depths of light
 From the sunheart I came of love a spark
 What should I do but love with all my might
 To die of love severe and pure and stark
 Were scarcely loss to lord a loveless height
 That were a living death damnations positive night

 17

 But love is life To die of love is then
 The only pass to higher life than this
 All love is death to loving living men
 All deaths are leaps across clefts to the abyss
 Our life is the broken current Lord of thine
 Flashing from morn to morn with conscious shine
 Then first by willing death selfmade then life divine

 18

 I love you my sweet children who are gone
 Into another mansion but I know
 I love you not as I shall love you yet
 I love you sweet dead children there are none
 In the land to which ye vanished to go
 Whose hearts more truly on your hearts are set
 Yet should I die of grief to love you only so

 19

 I am but as a beast before thee Lord
 Great poetking I thank thee for the word
 Leave not thy son halfmade in beastly guise
 Less than a man with more than human cries
 An unshaped thing in which thyself cries out
 Finish me Father now I am but a doubt
 Oh make thy moaning thing for joy to leap and shout

 20

 Let my soul talk to thee in ordered words
 O king of kings O lord of only lords
 When I am thinking thee within my heart
 From the broken reflex be not far apart
 The troubled water dim with upstirred soil
 Makes not the image which it yet can spoil
 Come nearer Lord and smooth the wrinkled coil

 21

 O Lord when I do think of my departed
 I think of thee who art the death of parting
 Of him who crying Father breathed his last
 Then radiant from the sepulchre upstarted
 Even then I think thy hands and feet kept smarting
 With us the bitterness of death is past
 But by the feet he still doth hold us fast

 22

 Therefore our hands thy feet do hold as fast
 We pray not to be spared the sorest pang
 But onlybe thou with us to the last
 Let not our heart be troubled at the clang
 Of hammer and nails nor dread the spears keen fang
 Nor the ghast sickening that comes of pain
 Nor yet the last clutch of the banished brain

 23

 Lord pity us we have no making power
 Then give us making will adopting thine
 Make make and make us temper and refine
 Be in us patienceneither to start nor cower
 Christ if thou be not with usnot by sign
 But presence actual as the wounds that bleed
 We shall not bear it but shall die indeed

 24

 O Christ have pity on all men when they come
 Unto the border haunted of dismay
 When that they know not draweth very near
 The other thing the opposite of day
 Formless and ghastly sick and gapingdumb
 Before which even love doth lose his cheer
 O radiant Christ remember then thy fear

 25

 Be by me Lord this day Thou knowst I mean
 Lord make me mind thee I herewith forestall
 My own forgetfulness when I stoop to glean
 The corn of earthwhich yet thy hand lets fall
 Be for me then against myself Oh lean
 Over me then when I invert my cup
 Take me if by the hair and lift me up

 26

 Lord of essential life help me to die
 To will to die is one with highest life
 The mightiest act that to Wills hand doth lie
 Born of Gods essence and of mans hard strife
 God give me strength my evil self to kill
 And die into the heaven of thy pure will
 Then shall this bodys death be very tolerable

 27

 As to our mothers came help in our birth
 Not lost in lifing us but saved and blest
 Self bearing self although right sorely prest
 Shall nothing lose but die and be at rest
 In life eternal beyond all care and dearth
 Godborn then truly a man does no more ill
 Perfectly loves and has whateer he will

 28

 As our dear animals do suffer less
 Because their pain spreads neither right nor left
 Lost in oblivion and foresightlessness
 Our suffering sore by faith shall be bereft
 Of all dismay and every weak excess
 His presence shall be better in our pain
 Than even selfabsence to the weaker brain

 29

 Father let this cup pass He prayedwas heard
 What cup was it that passed away from him
 Sure not the deathcup now filled to the brim
 There was no quailing in the awful word
 He still was king of kings of lords the lord
 He feared lest in the suffering waste and grim
 His faith might grow too faint and sickly dim

 30

 Thy mind my master I will dare explore
 What we are told that we are meant to know
 Into thy soul I search yet more and more
 Led by the lamp of my desire and woe
 If thee my Lord I may not understand
 I am a wanderer in a houseless land
 A weeping thirst by hot winds ever fanned

 31

 Therefore I look againand think I see
 That when at last he did cry out My God
 Why hast thou me forsaken straight mans rod
 Was turned aside for that same moment he
 Cried Father and gave up will and breath and spirit
 Into his hands whose all he did inherit
 Delivered glorified eternally





APRIL

 1

 LORD I do choose the higher than my will
 I would be handled by thy nursing arms
 After thy will not my infant alarms
 Hurt me thou wiltbut then more loving still
 If more can be and less in loves perfect zone
 My fancy shrinks from least of all thy harms
 But do thy will with meI am thine own

 2

 Some things wilt thou not one day turn to dreams
 Some dreams wilt thou not one day turn to fact
 The thing that painful more than should be seems
 Shall not thy sliding years with them retract
 Shall fair realities not counteract
 The thing that was well dreamed of bliss and joy
 Wilt thou not breathe thy life into the toy

 3

 I have had dreams of absolute delight
 Beyond all waking blissonly of grass
 Flowers wind a peak a limb of marble white
 They dwell with me like things half come to pass
 True prophecieswhen I with thee am right
 If I pray waking for such a joy of sight
 Thou with the gold wilt not refuse the brass

 4

 I think I shall not ever pray for such
 Thy bliss will overflood my heart and brain
 And I want no unripe things back again
 Love ever fresher lovelier than of old
 How should it want its more exchanged for much
 Love will not backward sigh but forward strain
 On in the tale still telling never told

 5

 What has been shall not only be but is
 The hues of dreamland strange and sweet and tender
 Are but hintshadows of full many a splendour
 Which the high Parentlove will yet unroll
 Before his childs obedient humble soul
 Ah me my God in thee lies every bliss
 Whose shadow men go hunting wearily amiss

 6

 Now ere I sleep I wonder what I shall dream
 Some sense of being utter new may come
 Into my soul while I am blind and dumb
 With shapes and airs and scents which dark hours teem
 Of other sort than those that haunt the day
 Hinting at precious things ages away
 In the long tale of us God to himself doth say

 7

 Late in a dream an unknown lady I saw
 Stand on a tomb down she to me stepped thence
 They tell me quoth I thou art one of the dead
 And scarce believed for gladness the yea she said
 A strange auroral bliss an arctic awe
 A new outworldish joy awoke intense
 To think I talked with one that verily was dead

 8

 Thou dost demand our love holy Lord Christ
 And batest nothing of thy modesty
 Thou knowst no other way to bliss the highest
 Than loving thee the loving perfectly
 Thou lovest perfectlythat is thy bliss
 We must love like thee or our being miss
 So to love perfectly love perfect Love love thee

 9

 Here is my heart O Christ thou knowst I love thee
 But wretched is the thing I call my love
 O Love divine rise up in me and move me
 I follow surely when thou first dost move
 To love the perfect love is primal mere
 Necessity and he who holds life dear
 Must love thee every hope and heart above

 10

 Might I but scatter interfering things
 Questions and doubts distrusts and anxious pride
 And in thy garment as under gathering wings
 Nestle obedient to thy loving side
 Easy it were to love thee But when thou
 Sendst me to think and labour from thee wide
 Love falls to asking many a why and how

 11

 Easier it were but poorer were the love
 Lord I would have me love thee from the deeps
 Of troubled thought of pain of weariness
 Through seething wastes below billows above
 My soul should rise in eager hungering leaps
 Through thorny thicks through sands unstable press
 Out of my dream to him who slumbers not nor sleeps

 12

 I do not fear the greatness of thy command
 To keep heartopenhouse to brother men
 But till in thy Gods love perfect I stand
 My door not wide enough will open Then
 Each man will be loveawful in my sight
 And open to the eternal mornings might
 Each human face will shine my window for thy light

 13

 Make me all patience and all diligence
 Patience that thou mayst have thy time with me
 Diligence that I waste not thy expense
 In sending out to bring me home to thee
 What though thy work in me transcends my sense
 Too fine too high for me to understand
 I hope entirely On Lord with thy labour grand

 14

 Lest I be humbled at the last and told
 That my great labour was but for my peace
 That not for love or truth had I been bold
 But merely for a prisoned hearts release
 Careful I humble me now before thy feet
 Whateer I be I cry and will not cease
 Let me not perish though favour be not meet

 15

 For what I seek thou knowest I must find
 Or miserably die for lack of love
 I justify thee what is in thy mind
 If it be shame to me all shame above
 Thou knowst I choose itknowst I would not shove
 The hand away that stripped me for the rod
 If so it pleased my Life my lovemadeangry God

 16

 I see a door a multitude near by
 In creed and quarrel sure disciples all
 Gladly they would they say enter the hall
 But cannot the stone threshold is so high
 From unseen hand full many a feeding crumb
 Slow dropping oer the threshold high doth come
 They gather and eat with much disputing hum

 17

 Still and anon a loud clear voice doth call
 Make your feet clean and enter so the hall
 They hear they stoop they gather each a crumb
 Oh the deaf people would they were also dumb
 Hear how they talk and lack of Christ deplore
 Stamping with muddy feet about the door
 And will not wipe them clean to walk upon his floor

 18

 But see one comes he listens to the voice
 Careful he wipes his weary dusty feet
 The voice hath spokento him is left no choice
 He hurries to obeythat only is meet
 Low sinks the threshold levelled with the ground
 The man leaps into liberty hes bound
 The rest go talking walking picking round

 19

 If I thus writing rebuke my neighbour dull
 And talk and write and enter not the door
 Than all the rest I wrong Christ tenfold more
 Making his gift of vision void and null
 Help me this day to be thy humble sheep
 Eating thy grass and following thou before
 From wolfish lies my life O Shepherd keep

 20

 God help me dull of heart to trust in thee
 Thou art the father of menot any mood
 Can part me from the One the verily Good
 When fog and failure oer my being brood
 When life looks but a glimmering marshy clod
 No fire out flashing from the living God
 Then then to rest in faith were worthy victory

 21

 To trust is gain and growth not mere sown seed
 Faith heaves the world round to the heavenly dawn
 In whose great light the soul doth spell and read
 Itself highborn its being derived and drawn
 From the eternal selfexistent fire
 Then mazed with joy of its own heavenly breed
 Exultanthumble falls before its awful sire

 22

 Art thou not Jesus busy like to us
 Thee shall I image as one sitting still
 Ordering all things in thy potent will
 Silent and thinking ever to thy father
 Whose thought through thee flows multitudinous
 Or shall I think of thee as journeying rather
 Ceaseless through space because thou everything dost fill

 23

 That all things thou dost fill I well may think
 Thy power doth reach me in so many ways
 Thou who in one the universe dost bind
 Passest through all the channels of my mind
 The sun of thought across the farthest brink
 Of consciousness thou sendest me thy rays
 Nor drawest them in when lost in sleep I sink

 24

 So common are thy paths thy coming seems
 Only another phase oft of my me
 But nearer is my I O Lord to thee
 Than is my I to what itself it deems
 How better then couldst thou O master come
 Than from thy home across into my home
 Straight oer the marches that I cannot see

 25

 MarchesTwixt thee and me theres no division
 Except the meeting of thy will and mine
 The loves that love the wills that will the same
 Where thine meets mine is my lifes true condition
 Yea only there it burns with any flame
 Thy will but holds me to my lifes fruition
 O God I wouldI have no mine that is not thine

 26

 I look for thee and do not see thee come
 If I could see thee twere a commoner thing
 And shallower comfort would thy coming bring
 Earth sea and air lie round me moveless dumb
 Never a tremble an expectant hum
 To tell the Lord of Hearts is drawing near
 Lo in the looking eyes the looked for Lord is here

 27

 I take a comfort from my very badness
 It is for lack of thee that I am bad
 How close how infinitely closer yet
 Must I come to thee ere I can pay one debt
 Which mere humanity has on me set
 How close to theeno wonder soul thou art glad
 Oneness with him is the eternal gladness

 28

 What can there be so close as making and made
 Nought twinned can be so near thou art more nigh
 To me my God than is this thinking I
 To that I mean when I by me is said
 Thou art more near me than is my ready will
 Near to my love though both one place do fill
 Yet till we are oneAh me the long until

 29

 Then shall my heart behold thee everywhere
 The vision rises of a speechless thing
 A perfectness of bliss beyond compare
 A time when I nor breathe nor think nor move
 But I do breathe and think and feel thy love
 The soul of all the songs the saints do sing
 And life dies out in bliss to come again in prayer

 30

 In the great glow of that great love this death
 Would melt away like a fantastic cloud
 I should no more shrink from it than from the breath
 That makes in the frosty air a nimbusshroud
 Thou Love hast conquered death and I aloud
 Should triumph over him with thy saintly crowd
 That where the Lamb goes ever followeth





MAY

 1

 WHAT though my words glance sideways from the thing
 Which I would utter in thine ear my sire
 Truth in the inward parts thou dost desire
 Wise hunger not a fitness fine of speech
 The little child that clamouring fails to reach
 With upstretched hand the fringe of her attire
 Yet meets the mothers hand down hurrying

 2

 Even when their foolish words they turned on him
 He did not his disciples send away
 He knew their hearts were foolish eyes were dim
 And therefore by his side needs must they stay
 Thou will not Lord send me away from thee
 When I am foolish make thy cock crow grim
 If that is not enough turn Lord and look on me

 3

 Another day of gloom and slanting rain
 Of closed skies cold winds and blight and bane
 Such not the weather Lord which thou art fain
 To give thy chosen sweet to heart and brain
 Until we mourn thou keepst the merry tune
 Thy hand unloved its pleasure must restrain
 Nor spoil both gift and child by lavishing too soon

 4

 But all things shall be ours Up heart and sing
 All things were made for uswe are Gods heirs
 Moon sun and wildest comets that do trail
 A crowd of small worlds for a swiftnesstail
 Up from Thy depths in me my childheart bring
 The child alone inherits anything
 Gods little childrengodsall things are theirs

 5

 Thy great deliverance is a greater thing
 Than purest imagination can foregrasp
 A thing beyond all conscious hungering
 Beyond all hope that makes the poet sing
 It takes the clinging world undoes its clasp
 Floats it afar upon a mighty sea
 And leaves us quiet with love and liberty and thee

 6

 Through all the fog through all earths wintery sighs
 I scent Thy spring I feel the eternal air
 Warm soft and dewy filled with flowery eyes
 And gentle murmuring motions everywhere
 Of life in heart and tree and brook and moss
 Thy breath wakes beauty love and bliss and prayer
 And strength to hang with nails upon thy cross

 7

 If thou hadst closed my life in seed and husk
 And cast me into soft warm damp dark mould
 All unaware of light come through the dusk
 I yet should feel the split of each shelly fold
 Should feel the growing of my prisoned heart
 And dully dream of being slow unrolled
 And in some other vagueness taking part

 8

 And little as the world I should foreknow
 Up into which I was about to rise
 Its rains its radiance airs and warmth and skies
 How it would greet me how its wind would blow
 As little it may be I do know the good
 Which I for years half darkling have pursued
 The second birth for which my nature cries

 9

 The life that knows not patient waits nor longs
 I know and would be patient yet would long
 I can be patient for all coming songs
 But let me sing my one monotonous song
 To me the time is slow my mould among
 To quicker life I fain would spur and start
 The aching growth at my dullswelling heart

 10

 Christ is the pledge that I shall one day see
 That one day still with him I shall awake
 And know my God at one with him and free
 O lordly essence come to life in me
 The willthrob let me feel that doth me make
 Now have I many a mighty hope in thee
 Then shall I rest although the universe should quake

 11

 Haste to me Lord when this foolheart of mine
 Begins to gnaw itself with selfish craving
 Or like a foul thing scarcely worth the saving
 Swoln up with wrath desireth vengeance fine
 Haste Lord to help when reason favours wrong
 Haste when thy soul the highborn thing divine
 Is torn by passions raving maniac throng

 12

 Fair freshness of the Godbreathed spirit air
 Pass through my soul and make it strong to love
 Wither with gracious cold what demons dare
 Shoot from my hell into my world above
 Let them drop down like leaves the sun doth sear
 And flutter far into the inane and bare
 Leaving my middleearth calm wise and clear

 13

 Even thou canst give me neither thought nor thing
 Were it the priceless pearl hid in the land
 Which if I fix thereon a greedy gaze
 Becomes not poison that doth burn and cling
 Their own bad look my foolish eyes doth daze
 They see the gift see not the giving hand
 From the living root the apple dead I wring

 14

 This versing even the reading of the tale
 That brings my heart its joy unspeakable
 Sometimes will softly unsuspectedly hale
 That heart from thee and all its pulses quell
 Discoverys pride joys bliss take aback my sail
 And sweep me from thy presence and my grace
 Because my eyes dropped from the masters face

 15

 Afresh I seek thee Lead meonce more I pray
 Even should it be against my will thy way
 Let me not feel thee foreign any hour
 Or shrink from thee as an estranged power
 Through doubt through faith through bliss through stark dismay
 Through sunshine wind or snow or fog or shower
 Draw me to thee who art my only day

 16

 I would go near theebut I cannot press
 Into thy presenceit helps not to presume
 Thy doors are deeds the handles are their doing
 He whose daylife is obedient righteousness
 Who after failure or a poor success
 Rises up stronger effort yet renewing
 He finds thee Lord at length in his own common room

 17

 Lord thou hast carried me through this evenings duty
 I am released weary and well content
 O soul put on the evening dress of beauty
 Thy sunsetflush of gold and purple blent
 Alas the moment I turn to my heart
 Feeling runs out of doors or stands apart
 But such as I am Lord take me as thou art

 18

 The word he then did speak fits now as then
 For the same kind of men doth mock at it
 Godfools Goddrunkards these do call the men
 Who think the poverty of their all not fit
 Borne humbly by their art their voice their pen
 Save for its allness at thy feet to fling
 For whom all is unfit that is not everything

 19

 O Christ my life possess me utterly
 Take me and make a little Christ of me
 If I am anything but thy fathers son
 Tis something not yet from the darkness won
 Oh give me light to live with open eyes
 Oh give me life to hope above all skies
 Give me thy spirit to haunt the Father with my cries

 20

 Tis hard for man to rouse his spirit up
 It is the human creative agony
 Though but to hold the heart an empty cup
 Or tighten on the team the rigid rein
 Many will rather lie among the slain
 Than creep through narrow ways the light to gain
 Than wake the will and be born bitterly

 21

 But he who would be born again indeed
 Must wake his soul unnumbered times a day
 And urge himself to life with holy greed
 Now ope his bosom to the Winds free play
 And now with patience forceful hard lie still
 Submiss and ready to the making will
 Athirst and empty for Gods breath to fill

 22

 All times are thine whose will is our remede
 Man turns to thee thou hast not turned away
 The look he casts thy labour that did breed
 It is thy work thy business all the day
 That look not foregone fitness thou dost heed
 For duty absolute how be fitter than now
 Or learn by shunningLord I come help thou

 23

 Ever above my coldness and my doubt
 Rises up something reaching forth a hand
 This thing I know but cannot understand
 Is it the God in me that rises out
 Beyond my self trailing it up with him
 Towards the spirithome the freedomland
 Beyond my conscious ken my near horizons brim

 24

 O God of man my heart would worship all
 My fellow men the flashes from thy fire
 Them in good sooth my lofty kindred call
 Born of the same one heart the perfect sire
 Love of my kind alone can set me free
 Help me to welcome all that come to me
 Not close my doors and dream solitude liberty

 25

 A loving word may set some door ajar
 Where seemed no door and that may enter in
 Which lay at the heart of that same loving word
 In my still chamber dwell thou always Lord
 Thy presence there will carriage true afford
 True words will flow pure of design to win
 And to my men my door shall have no bar

 26

 My prayers my God flow from what I am not
 I think thy answers make me what I am
 Like weary waves thought follows upon thought
 But the still depth beneath is all thine own
 And there thou movst in paths to us unknown
 Out of strange strife thy peace is strangely wrought
 If the lion in us praythou answerest the lamb

 27

 So bound in selfishness am I so chained
 I know it must be glorious to be free
 But know not what fullfraught the word doth mean
 By loss on loss I have severely gained
 Wisdom enough my slavery to see
 But liberty pure absolute serene
 No freestvisioned slave has ever seen

 28

 For that great freedom how should such as I
 Be able to imagine in such a self
 Less hopeless far the miser man might try
 To image the delight of friendshared pelf
 Freedom is to be like thee face and heart
 To know it Lord I must be as thou art
 I cannot breed the imagination high

 29

 Yet hints come to me from the realm unknown
 Airs drift across the twilight border land
 Odoured with life and as from some far strand
 Seamurmured whispers to my heart are blown
 That fill me with a joy I cannot speak
 Yea from whose shadow words drop faint and weak
 Thee God I shadow in that region grand

 30

 O Christ who didst appear in Judah land
 Thence by the cross go back to Gods right hand
 Plain history and things our sense beyond
 In thee together come and correspond
 How rulest thou from the undiscovered bourne
 The worldwise world that laughs thee still to scorn
 Please Lord let thy disciple understand

 31

 Tis heart on heart thou rulest Thou art the same
 At Gods right hand as here exposed to shame
 And therefore workest now as thou didst then
 Feeding the faint divine in humble men
 Through all thy realms from thee goes out heartpower
 Working the holy satisfying hour
 When all shall love and all be loved again





JUNE

 1

 FROM thine as then the healing virtue goes
 Into our heartsthat is the Fathers plan
 From heart to heart it sinks it steals it flows
 From these that know thee still infecting those
 Here is my heartfrom thine Lord fill it up
 That I may offer it as the holy cup
 Of thy communion to my every man

 2

 When thou dost send out whirlwinds on thy seas
 Alternatest thy lightning with its roar
 Thy night with morning and thy clouds with stars
 Or mightier force unseen in midst of these
 Orderest the life in every airy pore
 Guidest mens efforts rulst mishaps and jars
 Tis only for their hearts and nothing more

 3

 This this alone thy father careth for
 That men should live hearted throughout with thee
 Because the simple only life thou art
 Of the very truth of living the pure heart
 For this deep waters whelm the fruitful lea
 Wars ravage famine wastes plague withers nor
 Shall cease till men have chosen the better part

 4

 But like a virtuous medicine selfdiffused
 Through all mens hearts thy love shall sink and float
 Till every feeling false and thought unwise
 Selfish and seeking shall sternly disused
 Wither and die and shrivel up to nought
 And Christ whom they did hang twixt earth and skies
 Up in the inner world of men arise

 5

 Make me a fellow worker with thee Christ
 Nought else befits a Godborn energy
 Of all thats lovely only lives the highest
 Lifing the rest that it shall never die
 Up I would be to help theefor thou liest
 Not linenswathed in Josephs gardentomb
 But walkest crowned creations heart and bloom

 6

 My God when I would lift my heart to thee
 Imagination instantly doth set
 A cloudy something thin and vast and vague
 To stand for him who is the fact of me
 Then up the Will and doth her weakness plague
 To pay the heart her duty and her debt
 Showing the face that hearkeneth to the plea

 7

 And hence it comes that thou at times dost seem
 To fade into an image of my mind
 I dreamer cover hide thee up with dream
 Thee primal individual entity
 No likeness will I seek to frame or find
 But cry to that which thou dost choose to be
 To that which is my sight therefore I cannot see

 8

 No likeness Lo the Christ Oh large Enough
 I see yet fathom not the face he wore
 He isand out of him there is no stuff
 To make a man Let fail me every spark
 Of blissful vision on my pathway rough
 I have seen much and trust the perfect more
 While to his feet my faith crosses the wayless dark

 9

 Faith is the human shadow of thy might
 Thou art the one selfperfect life and we
 Who trust thy life therein join on to thee
 Taking our part in selfcreating light
 To trust is to step forward out of the night
 To beto share in the outgoing Will
 That lives and is because outgoing still

 10

 I am lost before thee Father yet I will
 Claim of thee my birthright ineffable
 Thou layst it on me son to claim thee sire
 To that which thou hast made me I aspire
 To thee the sun upflames thy kindled fire
 No man presumes in that to which he was born
 Less than the gift to claim would be the giver to scorn

 11

 Henceforth all things thy dealings are with me
 For out of thee is nothing or can be
 And all things are to draw us home to thee
 What matter that the knowers scoffing say
 This is old folly plain to the new day
 If thou be such as thou and they as they
 Unto thy Let there be they still must answer Nay

 12

 They will not therefore cannot do not know him
 Nothing they could know could be God In sooth
 Unto the true alone exists the truth
 They say well saying Nature doth not show him
 Truly she shows not what she cannot show
 And they deny the thing they cannot know
 Who sees a glory towards it will go

 13

 Faster no step moves God because the fool
 Shouts to the universe God there is none
 The blindest man will not preach out the sun
 Though on his darkness he should found a school
 It may be when he finds he is not dead
 Though world and body sight and sound are fled
 Some eyes may open in his foolish head

 14

 When I am very weary with hard thought
 And yet the question burns and is not quenched
 My heart grows cool when to remembrance wrought
 That thou who knowst the lightborn answer sought
 Knowst too the dark where the doubt lies entrenched
 Knowst with what seemings I am sore perplexed
 And that with thee I wait nor needs my soul be vexed

 15

 Who sets himself not sternly to be good
 Is but a fool who judgment of true things
 Has none however oft the claim renewed
 And he who thinks in his great plenitude
 To right himself and set his spirit free
 Without the might of higher communings
 Is foolish alsosave he willed himself to be

 16

 How many helps thou givst to those would learn
 To some sore pain to others a sinking heart
 To some a weariness worse than any smart
 To some a haunting fearing blind concern
 Madness to some to some the shaking dart
 Of hideous death still following as they turn
 To some a hunger that will not depart

 17

 To some thou givst a deep unresta scorn
 Of all they are or see upon the earth
 A gaze at dusky night and clearing morn
 As on a land of emptiness and dearth
 To some a bitter sorrow to some the sting
 Of love misprizedof sick abandoning
 To some a frozen heart oh worse than anything

 18

 To some a mocking demon that doth set
 The poor foiled will to scoff at the ideal
 But loathsome makes to them their life of jar
 The messengers of Satan think to mar
 But makedriving the soul from false to feal
 To thee the reconciler the one real
 In whom alone the would be and the is are met

 19

 Me thou hast given an infinite unrest
 A hungernot at first after known good
 But something vague I knew not and yet would
 The veiled Isis thy will not understood
 A conscience tossing ever in my breast
 And something deeper that will not be expressed
 Save as the Spirit thinking in the Spirits brood

 20

 But now the Spirit and I are one in this
 My hunger now is after righteousness
 My spirit hopes in God to set me free
 From the low self loathed of the higher me
 Great elder brother of my second birth
 Dear oer all names but one in heaven or earth
 Teach me all day to love eternally

 21

 Lo Lord thou knowst I would not anything
 That in the heart of God holds not its root
 Nor falsely deem there is any life at all
 That doth in him nor sleep nor shine nor sing
 I know the plants that bear the noisome fruit
 Of burning and of ashes and of gall
 From Gods heart torn rootless to mans they cling

 22

 Lifegiving love rots to devouring fire
 Justice corrupts to despicable revenge
 Motherhood chokes in the dams jealous mire
 Hunger for growth turns fluctuating change
 Loves anger grand grows spiteful human wrath
 Hunting men out of conscience holy path
 And human kindness takes the tattlers range

 23

 Nothing can draw the heart of man but good
 Low good it is that draws him from the higher
 So evilpoison uncreate from food
 Never a foul thing with temptation dire
 Tempts hellward force created to aspire
 But walks in wronged strength of imprisoned Truth
 Whose mantle also oft the Shame induth

 24

 Love in the prime not yet I understand
 Scarce know the love that loveth at first hand
 Help me my selfishness to scatter and scout
 Blow on me till my love loves burningly
 Then the great love will burn the mean self out
 And I in glorious simplicity
 Living by love shall love unspeakably

 25

 Oh make my anger purelet no worst wrong
 Rouse in me the old niggard selfishness
 Give me thine indignationwhich is love
 Turned on the evil that would part loves throng
 Thy anger scathes because it needs must bless
 Gathering into union calm and strong
 All things on earth and under and above

 26

 Make my forgiveness downrightsuch as I
 Should perish if I did not have from thee
 I let the wrong go withered up and dry
 Cursed with divine forgetfulness in me
 Tis but selfpity pleasant mean and sly
 Low whispering bids the paltry memory live
 What am I brother for but to forgive

 27

 Thou art my fathers childcome to my heart
 Thus must I say or Thou must say Depart
 Thus I would sayI would be as thou art
 Thus I must say or still I work athwart
 The absolute necessity and law
 That dwells in me and will me asunder draw
 If in obedience I leave any flaw

 28

 Lord I forgiveand step in unto thee
 If I have enemies Christ deal with them
 He hath forgiven me and Jerusalem
 Lord set me from selfinspiration free
 And let me live and think from thee not me
 Rather from deepest me then think and feel
 At centre of thoughts swiftrevolving wheel

 29

 I sit oercanopied with Beautys tent
 Through which flies many a goldenwinged dove
 Well watched of Fancys tender eyes up bent
 A hundred Powers wait on me ministering
 A thousand treasures Art and Knowledge bring
 Will Conscience Reason tower the rest above
 But in the midst alone I gladness am and love

 30

 Tis but a vision Lord I do not mean
 That thus I am or have one moment been
 Tis but a picture hung upon my wall
 To measure dull contentment therewithal
 And know behind the human how I fall
 A vision true of what one day shall be
 When thou hast had thy very will with me





JULY

 1

 ALAS my tent see through it a whirlwind sweep
 Moaning poor Fancys doves are swept away
 I sit alone a sorrow half asleep
 My consciousness the blackness all astir
 No pilgrim I a homeless wanderer
 For how canst Thou be in the darkness deep
 Who dwellest only in the living day

 2

 It must be somewhere in my fluttering tent
 Strange creatures half tamed only yet are pent
 Dragons lopwinged birds and largeeyed snakes
 Hark through the storm the saddest howling breaks
 Or are they loose roaming about the bent
 The darkness dire deepening with moan and scream
 My Morning rise and all shall be a dream

 3

 Not thine my Lord the darkness all is mine
 Save that as mine my darkness too is thine
 All things are thine to save or to destroy
 Destroy my darkness rise my perfect joy
 Love primal the live coal of every night
 Flame out scare the ill things with radiant fright
 And fill my tent with laughing morns delight

 4

 Master thou workest with such common things
 Low souls weak hearts I meanand hast to use
 Therefore such common means and rescuings
 That hard we find it as we sit and muse
 To think thou workest in us verily
 Bad seaboats we and manned with wretched crews
 That doubt the captain watch the stormspray flee

 5

 Thou art hampered in thy natural working then
 When beings designed on freedoms holy plan
 Will not be free with thy poor foolish men
 Thou therefore hast to work just like a man
 But when tangling thyself in their sore need
 Thou hast to freedom fashioned them indeed
 Then wilt thou grandly move and Godlike speed

 6

 Will this not then show grandest fact of all
 In thy creation victory most renowned
 That thou hast wrought thy will by slow and small
 And made men like thee though thy making bound
 By that which they were not and could not be
 Until thou madst them make along with thee
 Master the tardiness is but in me

 7

 Hence come thy checksbecause I still would run
 My head into the sand nor flutter aloft
 Towards thy home with thy wind under me
 Tis because I am mean thy ways so oft
 Look mean to me my rise is low begun
 But scarce thy will doth grasp me ere I see
 For my arrest and rise its stern necessity

 8

 Like clogs upon the pinions of thy plan
 We hanglike captives on thy chariotwheels
 Who should climb up and ride with Deaths conqueror
 Therefore thy train along the worlds highway steals
 So slow to the peace of heartreluctant man
 What shall we do to spread the wing and soar
 Nor straiten thy deliverance any more

 9

 The sole way to put flight into the wing
 To preen its feathers and to make them grow
 Is to heed humbly every smallest thing
 With which the Christ in us has aught to do
 So will the Christ from child to manhood go
 Obedient to the father Christ and so
 Sweet holy change will turn all our old things to new

 10

 Creation thou dost work by faint degrees
 By shade and shadow from unseen beginning
 Far far apart in unthought mysteries
 Of thy own dark unfathomable seas
 Thou willst thy will and thence upon the earth
 Slow travelling his way through centuries winning
 A child at length arrives at never ending birth

 11

 Well mayst thou then work on indocile hearts
 By small successes disappointments small
 By nature weather failure or sore fall
 By shame anxiety bitterness and smarts
 By loneliness by weary loss of zest
 The rags the husks the swine the hungerquest
 Drive home the wanderer to the fathers breast

 12

 How suddenly some rapid turn of thought
 May throw the lifemachine all out of gear
 Clouding the windows with the steam of doubt
 Filling the eyes with dust with noise the ear
 Who knows not then where dwells the engineer
 Rushes aghast into the pathless night
 And wanders in a land of dreary fright

 13

 Amazed at sightless whirring of their wheels
 Confounded with the recklessness and strife
 Distract with fears of what may next ensue
 Some break rude exit from the house of life
 And plunge into a silence out of view
 Whence not a cry no wafture once reveals
 What door they have broke open with the knife

 14

 Help me my Father in whatever dismay
 Whatever terror in whatever shape
 To hold the faster by thy garments hem
 When my heart sinks oh lift it up I pray
 Thy child should never fear though hell should gape
 Not blench though all the ills that men affray
 Stood round him like the Roman round Jerusalem

 15

 Too eager I must not be to understand
 How should the work the master goes about
 Fit the vague sketch my compasses have planned
 I am his housefor him to go in and out
 He builds me nowand if I cannot see
 At any time what he is doing with me
 Tis that he makes the house for me too grand

 16

 The house is not for meit is for him
 His royal thoughts require many a stair
 Many a tower many an outlook fair
 Of which I have no thought and need no care
 Where I am most perplexed it may be there
 Thou makst a secret chamber holydim
 Where thou wilt come to help my deepest prayer

 17

 I cannot tell why this day I am ill
 But I am well because it is thy will
 Which is to make me pure and right like thee
 Not yet I need escapetis bearable
 Because thou knowest And when harder things
 Shall rise and gather and overshadow me
 I shall have comfort in thy strengthenings

 18

 How do I live when thou art far away
 When I am sunk and lost and dead in sleep
 Or in some dream with no sense in its play
 When wearydull or drowned in study deep
 O Lord I live so utterly on thee
 I live when I forget thee utterly
 Not that thou thinkest of but thinkest me

 19

 Thou farthat word the holy truth doth blur
 Doth the great ocean from the small fish run
 When it sleeps fast in its low weedy bower
 Is the sun far from any smallest flower
 That lives by his dear presence every hour
 Are they not one in oneness without stir
 The flower the flower because the sun the sun

 20

 Dear presence every hourwhat of the night
 When crumpled daisies shut gold sadness in
 And some do hang the head for lack of light
 Sick almost unto death with absenceblight
 Thy memory then warmlingering in the ground
 Mourned dewy in the air keeps their hearts sound
 Till fresh with day their lapsed life begin

 21

 All things are shadows of the shining true
 Sun sea and airclose potent hurtless fire
 Flowers from their mothers prisondove and dew
 Every thing holds a slender guiding clue
 Back to the mighty onenesshearts of faith
 Know thee than light than heat endlessly nigher
 Our lifes life carpenter of Nazareth

 22

 Sometimes perhaps the spiritual blood runs slow
 And soft along the veins of will doth flow
 Seeking Gods arteries from which it came
 Or does the etherial creative flame
 Turn back upon itself and latent grow
 It matters not what figure or what name
 If thou art in me and I am not to blame

 23

 In such Godsilence the souls nest so long
 As all is still no flutter and no song
 Is safe But if my soul begin to act
 Without some waking to the eternal fact
 That my dear life is hid with Christ in God
 I think and move a creature of earths clod
 Stand on the finite act upon the wrong

 24

 My soul this sermon hence for itself prepares
 Then is there nothing vile thou mayst not do
 Buffeted in a tumult of low cares
 And treacheries of the old man gainst the new
 Lord in my spirit let thy spirit move
 Warning that it may not have to reprove
 In my dead moments master stir the prayers

 25

 Lord let my soul oerburdened then feel thee
 Thrilling through all its brains stupidity
 If I must slumber heedless of ill harms
 Let it not be but in my Fathers arms
 Outside the shelter of his garments fold
 All is a waste a terrorhaunted wold
 Lord keep me Tis thy child that cries Behold

 26

 Some say that thou their endless love host won
 By deeds for them which I may not believe
 Thou ever didst or ever willedst done
 What matter so they love thee They receive
 Eternal more than the poor loom and wheel
 Of their invention ever wove and spun
 I love thee for I must thine all from head to heel

 27

 The love of thee will set all notions right
 Right save by love no thought can be or may
 Only loves knowledge is the primal light
 Questions keep camp along loves shining coast
 Challenge my love and would my entrance stay
 Across the buzzing doubting challenging host
 I rush to thee and cling and cryThou knowst

 28

 Oh let me live in thy realities
 Nor substitute my notions for thy facts
 Notion with notion making leagues and pacts
 They are to truth but as dreamdeeds to acts
 And questioned make me doubt of everything
 O Lord my God my heart gets up and cries
 Come thy own self and with thee my faith bring

 29

 O master my desires to work to know
 To be aware that I do live and grow
 All restless wish for anything not thee
 I yield and on thy altar offer me
 Let me no more from out thy presence go
 But keep me waiting watchful for thy will
 Even while I do it waiting watchful still

 30

 Thou art the Lord of life the secret thing
 Thou wilt give endless more than I could find
 Even if without thee I could go and seek
 For thou art one Christ with my deepest mind
 Duty alive selfwilled in me dost speak
 And to a deeper purer being sting
 I come to thee my life my causing kind

 31

 Nothing is alien in thy world immense
 No look of sky or earth or man or beast
 In the great hand of God I stand and thence
 Look out on life his endless holy feast
 To try to feel is but to court despair
 To dig for a sun within a gardenfence
 Who does thy will O God he lives upon thy air





AUGUST

 1

 SO shall abundant entrance me be given
 Into the truth my lifes inheritance
 Lo as the sun shoots straight from out his tomb
 Godfloated casting round a lordly glance
 Into the corners of his endless room
 So through the rent which thou O Christ hast riven
 I enter libertys divine expanse

 2

 It will be soah so it is not now
 Who seeks thee for a little lazy peace
 Then like a man all weary of the plough
 That leaves it standing in the furrows crease
 Turns from thy presence for a foolish while
 Till comes again the rasp of unrests file
 From liberty is distant many a mile

 3

 Like one that stops and drinks and turns and goes
 Into a land where never water flows
 There travels on the dry and thirsty day
 Until the hot night veils the farther way
 Then turns and finds again the bubbling pool
 Here would I build my house take up my stay
 Nor ever leave my Sychars margin cool

 4

 Keep me Lord with thee I call from out the dark
 Hear in thy light of which I am a spark
 I know not what is mine and what is thine
 Of branch and stem I miss the differing mark
 But if a mere hairsbreadth me separateth
 That hairsbreadth is eternal infinite death
 For sap thy dead branch calls O living vine

 5

 I have no choice I must do what I can
 But thou dost me and all things else as well
 Thou wilt take care thy child shall grow a man
 Rouse thee my faith be king with life be one
 To trust in God is actions highest kind
 Who trusts in God his heart with life doth swell
 Faith opens all the windows to Gods wind

 6

 O Father thou art my eternity
 Not on the clasp Of consciousnesson thee
 My life depends and I can well afford
 All to forget so thou remember Lord
 In thee I rest in sleep thou dost me fold
 In thee I labour still in thee grow old
 And dying shall I not in thee my Life be bold

 7

 In holy things may be unholy greed
 Thou givst a glimpse of many a lovely thing
 Not to be stored for use in any mind
 But only for the present spiritual need
 The holiest bread if hoarded soon will breed
 The mammonmoth the havingpride I find
 Tis momently thy heart gives out heartquickening

 8

 It is thyself and neither this nor that
 Nor anything told taught or dreamed of thee
 That keeps us live The holy maid who sat
 Low at thy feet choosing the better part
 Rising bore with herwhat a memory
 Yet brooding only on that treasure she
 Had soon been roused by conscious loss of heart

 9

 I am a fool when I would stop and think
 And lest I lose my thoughts from duty shrink
 It is but avarice in another shape
 Tis as the vinebranch were to hoard the grape
 Nor trust the living root beneath the sod
 What trouble is that child to thee my God
 Who sips thy gracious cup and will not drink

 10

 True faithful action only is the life
 The grapes for which we feel the pruning knife
 Thoughts are but leaves they fall and feed the ground
 The holy seasons swift and slow go round
 The ministering leaves return fresh large and rife
 But fresher larger more thoughts to the brain
 Farewell my dovecome back hopeladen through the rain

 11

 Well may this body poorer feebler grow
 It is undressing for its last sweet bed
 But why should the soul which death shall never know
 Authority and power and memory shed
 It is that love with absolute faith would wed
 God takes the inmost garments off his child
 To have him in his arms naked and undefiled

 12

 Thou art my knowledge and my memory
 No less than my real deeper life my love
 I will not fool degrade myself to trust
 In less than that which maketh me say Me
 In less than that causing itself to be
 Then art within me behind beneath above
 I will be thine because I may and must

 13

 Thou art the truth the life Thou Lord wilt see
 To every question that perplexes me
 I am thy being and my dignity
 Is written with my name down in thy book
 Thou wilt care for it Never shall I think
 Of anything that thou mightst overlook
 In faithborn triumph at thy feet I sink

 14

 Thou carest more for that which I call mine
 In same sortbetter manner than I could
 Even if I knew creations ends divine
 Rousing in me this vague desire of good
 Thou art more to me than my desires whole brood
 Thou art the only person and I cry
 Unto the father I of this my I

 15

 Thou who inspirest prayer then bendst thine ear
 It crying with loves grand respect to hear
 I cannot give myself to thee aright
 With the triumphant uttermost of gift
 That cannot be till I am full of light
 To perfect deed a perfect will must lift
 Inspire possess compel me first of every might

 16

 I do not wonder men can ill believe
 Who make poor claims upon thee perfect Lord
 Then most I trust when most I would receive
 I wonder not that such do pray and grieve
 The God they think to be God is not fit
 Then only in thy glory I seem to sit
 When my heart claims from thine an infinite accord

 17

 More life I need ere I myself can be
 Sometimes when the eternal tide ebbs low
 A moment weary of my life I grow
 Weary of my existence self I mean
 Not of its plodding not its wind and snow
 Then to thy knee trusting I turn and lean
 Thou willst I live and I do will with thee

 18

 Dost thou mean sometimes that we should forget thee
 Dropping the veil of things twixt thee and us
 Ah not that we should lose thee and regret thee
 But that we turning from our windows thus
 The frostfixed God should vanish from the pane
 Sunmelted and a moment Father let thee
 Look like thyself straight into heart and brain

 19

 For sometimes when I am busy among men
 With heart and brain an open thoroughfare
 For faces words and thoughts other than mine
 And a pause comes at lengthoh sudden then
 Back throbs the tide with rush exultant rare
 And for a gentle moment I divine
 Thy dawning presence flush my tremulous air

 20

 If I have to forget thee do thou see
 It be a good not bad forgetfulness
 That all its mellow truthful air be free
 From dusty noes and soft with many a yes
 That as thy breath my life my life may be
 Mans breath So when thou comst at hour unknown
 Thou shalt find nothing in me but thine own

 21

 Thou being in me in my deepest me
 Through all the time I do not think of thee
 Shall I not grow at last so true within
 As to forget thee and yet never sin
 Shall I not walk the loud worlds busy way
 Yet in thy palaceporch sit all the day
 Not conscious think of thee yet never from thee stray

 22

 ForgetOh must it beWould it were rather
 That every sense was so filled with my father
 That not in anything could I forget him
 But deepest highest must in all things set him
 Yet if thou think in me God what great matter
 Though my poor thought to former break and latter
 As now my best thoughts break before thee foiled and scatter

 23

 Some way there must be of my not forgetting
 And thither thou art leading me my God
 The child that weary of his mothers petting
 Runs out the moment that his feet are shod
 May see her face in every flower he sees
 And she although beyond the window sitting
 Be nearer him than when he sat upon her knees

 24

 What if when I at last at the long last
 Shall see thy face my Lord my lifes delight
 It should not be the face that hath been glassed
 In poor imaginations mirror slight
 Will my soul sink and shall I stand aghast
 Beggared of hope my heart a conscious blight
 Amazed and lostdeaths bitterness come and not passed

 25

 Ah no for from thy heart the love will press
 And shining from thy perfect human face
 Will sink into me like the fathers kiss
 And deepening wide the gulf of consciousness
 Beyond imaginations lowest abyss
 Will with the potency of creative grace
 Lord it throughout the larger thinking place

 26

 Thus Godpossessed new born ah not for long
 Should I the sight behold beatified
 Know it creating in me feel the throng
 Of speechless hopes outthrobbing like a tide
 And my heart rushing borne aloft the flood
 To offer at his feet its living blood
 Ere gloryhid the other face I spied

 27

 For out imagination is in small
 And with the makingdifference that must be
 Mirror of Gods creating mirror all
 That shows itself therein that formeth he
 And there is Christ no bodiless vanity
 Though face to face the mighty perfectness
 With glory blurs the dimreflected less

 28

 I clasp thy feet O father of the living
 Thou wilt not let my fluttering hopes be more
 Or lovelier or greater than thy giving
 Surely thy ships will bring to my poor shore
 Of gold and peacocks such a shining store
 As will laugh all the dreams to holy scorn
 Of love and sorrow that were ever born

 29

 Sometimes it seems pure natural to trust
 And trust right largely grandly infinitely
 Daring the splendour of the givers part
 At other times the whole earth is but dust
 The sky is dust yea dust the human heart
 Then art thou nowhere there is no room for thee
 In the great dustheap of eternity

 30

 But why should it be possible to mistrust
 Nor possible only but its opposite hard
 Why should not man believe because he must
 By sights compulsion Why should he be scarred
 With conflict worn with doubting fine and long
 No man is fit for heavens musician throng
 Who has not tuned an instrument all shook and jarred

 31

 Therefore O Lord when all things common seem
 When all is dust and self the centre clod
 When grandeur is a hopeless foolish dream
 And anxious care more reasonable than God
 Out of the ashes I will call to thee
 In spite of dead distrust call earnestly
 Oh thou who livest call then answer dying me





SEPTEMBER

 1

 WE are a shadow and a shining we
 One moment nothing seems but what we see
 Nor aught to rule but common circumstance
 Nought is to seek but praise to shun but chance
 A moment more and God is all in all
 And not a sparrow from its nest can fall
 But from the ground its chirp goes up into his hall

 2

 I know at least which is the better mood
 When on a heap of cares I sit and brood
 Like Job upon his ashes sorely vext
 I feel a lower thing than when I stood
 The worlds true heir fearless as on its stalk
 A lily meeting Jesus in his walk
 I am not all moodI can judge betwixt

 3

 Such differing moods can scarce to one belong
 Shall the same fountain sweet and bitter yield
 Shall what bore late the dustmood think and brood
 Till it bring forth the great believing mood
 Or that which bore the grand mood bald and peeled
 Sit down to croon the shabby sensual song
 To hug itself and sink from wrong to meaner wrong

 4

 In the low mood the mere man acts alone
 Moved by impulses which if from within
 Yet far outside the centre man begin
 But in the grand mood every softest tone
 Comes from the living God at very heart
 From thee who infinite core of being art
 Thee who didst call our names ere ever we could sin

 5

 There is a coward sparing in the heart
 Offspring of penury and lowborn fear
 Prayer must take heed nor overdo its part
 Asking too much of him with open ear
 Sinners must wait not seek the very best
 Cry out for peace and be of middling cheer
 False heart thou cheatest God and dost thy life molest

 6

 Thou hungerest not thou thirstest not enough
 Thou art a temporizing thing mean heart
 Downdrawn thou pickst up straws and wretched stuff
 Stooping as if the worlds floor were the chart
 Of the long way thy lazy feet must tread
 Thou dreamest of the crown hung oer thy head
 But that is safethou gatherest hairs and fluff

 7

 Mans highest action is to reach up higher
 Stir up himself to take hold of his sire
 Then best I love you dearest when I go
 And cry to loves life I may love you so
 As to content the yearning making love
 That perfects strength divine in weakness fire
 And from the broken pots calls out the silver dove

 8

 Poor am I God knows poor as withered leaf
 Poorer or richer than I dare not ask
 To love aright for me were hopeless task
 Eternities too high to comprehend
 But shall I tear my heart in hopeless grief
 Or rise and climb and run and kneel and bend
 And drink the primal loveso love in chief

 9

 Then love shall wake and be its own high life
 Then shall I know tis I that love indeed
 Ready without a moments questioning strife
 To be forgot like bursting waterbead
 For the high good of the eternal dear
 All hope all claim resting with spirit clear
 Upon the living love that every love doth breed

 10

 Ever seem to fail in utterance
 Sometimes amid the swift melodious dance
 Of fluttering wordsas if it had not been
 The thought has melted vanished into night
 Sometimes I say a thing I did not mean
 And lo tis better by thy ordered chance
 Than what eluded me floating too feathery light

 11

 If thou wouldst have me speak Lord give me speech
 So many cries are uttered nowadays
 That scarce a song however clear and true
 Will thread the jostling tumult safe and reach
 The ears of men buzfilled with poor denays
 Barb thou my words with light make my song new
 And men will hear or when I sing or preach

 12

 Can anything go wrong with me I ask
 And the same moment at a sudden pain
 Stand trembling Up from the great rivers brim
 Comes a cold breath the farther bank is dim
 The heaven is black with clouds and coming rain
 High soaring faith is grown a heavy task
 And all is wrong with weary heart and brain

 13

 Things do go wrong I know grief pain and fear
 I see them lord it sore and wide around
 From her fair twilight answers Truth starcrowned
 Things wrong are needful where wrong things abound
 Things go not wrong but Pain with dog and spear
 False faith from human hearts will hunt and hound
 The earth shall quake neath them that trust the solid ground

 14

 Things go not wrong when sudden I fall prone
 But when I snatch my upheld hand from thine
 And proud or careless think to walk alone
 Then things go wrong when I poor silly sheep
 To shelves and pits from the good pasture creep
 Not when the shepherd leaves the ninety and nine
 And to the mountains goes after the foolish one

 15

 Lo now thy swift dogs over stone and bush
 After me straying sheep loud barking rush
 Theres Fear and Shame and Emptyheart and Lack
 And Lostlove and a thousand at their back
 I see thee not but know thou houndst them on
 And I am lost indeedescape is none
 See there they come down streaming on my track

 16

 I rise and run staggeringdouble and run
 But whitherwhitherwhither for escape
 The sea lies all about this longnecked cape
 There come the dogs straight for me every one
 Me live despair live centre of alarms
 Ah lo twixt me and all his barking harms
 The shepherd loI runfall folded in his arms

 17

 There let the dogs yelp let them growl and leap
 It is no matterI will go to sleep
 Like a spent cloud pass pain and grief and fear
 Out from behind it unchanged love shines clear
 Oh save me ChristI know not what I am
 I was thy stupid selfwilled greedy lamb
 Would be thy honest and obedient sheep

 18

 Why is it that so often I return
 From social converse with a spirit worn
 A lack a disappointmenteven a sting
 Of shame as for some low unworthy thing
 Because I have not careful first of all
 Set my door open wide back to the wall
 Ere I at others doors did knock and call

 19

 Yet more and more of me thou dost demand
 My faith and hope in God alone shall stand
 The life of lawnot trust the rain and sun
 To draw the golden harvest oer the land
 I must not sayThis too will pass and die
 The wind will change Round will the seasons run
 Law is the body of will of conscious harmony

 20

 Who trusts a law might worship a god of wood
 Half his soul slumbers if it be not dead
 He is a live thing shut in chaos crude
 Hemmed in with dragonsa remorseless head
 Still hanging over its uplifted eyes
 No God is all in all and nowhere dies
 The present heart and thinking will of good

 21

 Law is our schoolmaster Our master Christ
 Lived under all our laws yet always prayed
 So walked the water when the storm was highest
 Law is Thy fathers thou hast it obeyed
 And it thereby subject to thee hast made
 To rule it master for thy brethrens sakes
 Well may he guide the law by whom laws maker makes

 22

 Death haunts our souls with dissolutions strife
 Soaks them with unrest makes our every breath
 A throe not action from Gods purest gift
 Wipes off the bloom and on the harp of faith
 Its fretted strings doth slacken still and shift
 Life everywhere perfect and always life
 Is sole redemption from this haunting death

 23

 God thou from death dost lift me As I rise
 Its Lethe from my garment drips and flows
 Ere long I shall be safe in upper air
 With thee my lifewith thee my answered prayer
 Where thou art God in every wind that blows
 And self alone and ever softly dies
 There shall my being blossom and I know it fair

 24

 I would dig Master in no field but thine
 Would build my house only upon thy rock
 Yet am but a dull day with a seasheen
 Why should I wonder then that they should mock
 Who in the limbo of things heard and seen
 Hither and thither blowing lose the shine
 Of every light that hangs in the firmament divine

 25

 Lord loosen in me the hold of visible things
 Help me to walk by faith and not by sight
 I would through thickest veils and coverings
 See into the chambers of the living light
 Lord in the land of things that swell and seem
 Help me to walk by the other light supreme
 Which shows thy facts behind mans vaguely hinting dream

 26

 I see a little child whose eager hands
 Search the thick stream that drains the crowded street
 For possible things hid in its current slow
 Near by behind him a great palace stands
 Where kings might welcome nobles to their feet
 Soft sounds sweet scents fair sights there only go
 There the childs father lives but the child does not know

 27

 On eager hungry busyseeking child
 Rise up turn round run in run up the stair
 Far in a chamber from rude noise exiled
 Thy father sits pondering how thou dost fare
 The mighty man will clasp thee to his breast
 Will kiss thee stroke the tangles of thy hair
 And lap thee warm in fold on fold of lovely rest

 28

 The prince of this world came and nothing found
 In thee O master but ah woe is me
 He cannot pass me on other business bound
 But spying in me things familiar he
 Casts over me the shadow of his flight
 And straight I moan in darknessand the fight
 Begins afresh betwixt the world and thee

 29

 In my own heart O master in my thought
 Betwixt the woolly sheep and hairy goat
 Not clearly I distinguish but I think
 Thou knowest that I fight upon thy side
 The how I am ashamed of for I shrink
 From many a blowam borne on the battletide
 When I should rush to the front and take thy foe by the throat

 30

 The enemy still hath many things in me
 Yea many an evil nest with open hole
 Gapes out to him at which he enters free
 But like the impact of a burning coal
 His presence mere straight rouses the garrison
 And all are up in arms and down on knee
 Fighting and praying till the foe is gone





OCTOBER

 1

 REMEMBER Lord thou hast not made me good
 Or if thou didst it was so long ago
 I have forgottenand never understood
 I humbly think At best it was a crude
 A roughhewn goodness that did need this woe
 This sin these harms of all kinds fierce and rude
 To shape it out making it live and grow

 2

 But thou art making me I thank thee sire
 What thou hast done and doest thou knowst well
 And I will help theegently in thy fire
 I will lie burning on thy potterswheel
 I will whirl patient though my brain should reel
 Thy grace shall be enough the grief to quell
 And growing strength perfect through weakness dire

 3

 I have not knowledge wisdom insight thought
 Nor understanding fit to justify
 Thee in thy work O Perfect Thou hast brought
 Me up to thisand lo what thou hast wrought
 I cannot call it good But I can cry
 O enemy the maker hath not done
 One day thou shalt behold and from the sight wilt run

 4

 The faith I will aside is easily bent
 But of thy love my God one glimpse alone
 Can make me absolutely confident
 With faith hope joy in love responsive blent
 My soul then in the vision mighty grown
 Its father and its fate securely known
 Falls on thy bosom with exultant moan

 5

 Thou workest perfectly And if it seem
 Some things are not so well tis but because
 They are too lovingdeep too loftywise
 For me poor child to understand their laws
 My highest wisdom half is but a dream
 My love runs helpless like a falling stream
 Thy good embraces ill and lo its illness dies

 6

 From sleep I wake and wake to think of thee
 But wherefore not with sudden glorious glee
 Why burst not gracious on me heaven and earth
 In all the splendour of a newdaybirth
 Why hangs a cloud betwixt my lord and me
 The moment that my eyes the morning greet
 My soul should panting rush to clasp thy fatherfeet

 7

 Is it because it is not thou I see
 But only my poor blotted fancy of thee
 Oh never till thyself reveal thy face
 Shall I be flooded with lifes vital grace
 Oh make my mirrorheart thy shiningplace
 And then my soul awaking with the morn
 Shall be a waking joy eternally newborn

 8

 Lord in my silver is much metal base
 Else should my being by this time have shown
 Thee thy own self therein Therefore do I
 Wake in the furnace I know thou sittest by
 Refininglook keep looking in to try
 Thy silver master look and see thy face
 Else here I lie for ever blank as any stone

 9

 But when in the dim silver thou dost look
 I do behold thy face though blurred and faint
 Oh joy no flaw in me thy grace will brook
 But still refine slow shall the silver pass
 From bright to brighter till sans spot or taint
 Love well content shall see no speck of brass
 And I his perfect face shall hold as in a glass

 10

 With every morn my life afresh must break
 The crust of self gathered about me fresh
 That thy windspirit may rush in and shake
 The darkness out of me and rend the mesh
 The spiderdevils spin out of the flesh
 Eager to net the soul before it wake
 That it may slumberous lie and listen to the snake

 11

 Tis that I am not goodthat is enough
 I pry no fartherthat is not the way
 Here O my potter is thy making stuff
 Set thy wheel going let it whir and play
 The chips in me the stones the straws the sand
 Cast them out with fine separating hand
 And make a vessel of thy yielding clay

 12

 What if it take a thousand years to make me
 So me he leave not angry on the floor
 Nay thou art never angrythat would break me
 Would I tried never thy dear patience sore
 But were as good as thou couldst well expect me
 Whilst thou dost make I mar and thou correct me
 Then were I now content waiting for something more

 13

 Only my God see thou that I content thee
 Oh take thy own content upon me God
 Ah never never sure wilt thou repent thee
 That thou hast called thy Adam from the clod
 Yet must I mourn that thou shouldst ever find me
 One moment sluggish needing more of the rod
 Than thou didst think when thy desire designed me

 14

 My God it troubles me I am not better
 More help I pray still more Thy perfect debtor
 I shall be when thy perfect child I am grown
 My Father help meam I not thine own
 Lo other lords have had dominion oer me
 But now thy will alone I set before me
 Thy own hearts lifeLord thou wilt not abhor me

 15

 In youth when once again I had set out
 To find thee Lord my life my liberty
 A window now and then clouds all about
 Would open into heaven my heart forlorn
 First all would tremble with a solemn glee
 Then whelmed in peace rest like a man outworn
 That sees the dawn slow part the closed lids of the morn

 16

 Now I grow old and the softgathered years
 Have calmed yea dulled the hearts swift fluttering beat
 But a quiet hope that keeps its household seat
 Is better than recurrent glories fleet
 To know thee Lord is worth a many tears
 And when this mildew age has dried away
 My heart will beat again as young and strong and gay

 17

 Stronger and gayer tenfoldbut O friends
 Not for itself nor any hoarded bliss
 I see but vaguely whither my being tends
 All vaguely spy a glory shadowblent
 Vaguely desire the individual kiss
 But when I think of God a large content
 Fills the dull air of my gray cloudy tent

 18

 Father of me thou art my bliss secure
 Make of me maker whatsoeer thou wilt
 Let fancys wings hang moulting hope grow poor
 And doubt steam up from where a joy was spilt
 I lose no time to reason it plain and clear
 But fly to thee my lifes perfection dear
 Not what I think but what thou art makes sure

 19

 This utterance of spirit through still thought
 This forming of heartstuff in moulds of brain
 Is helpful to the soul by which tis wrought
 The shape reacting on the heart again
 But when I am quite old and words are slow
 Like dying things that keep their holes for woe
 And memorys withering tendrils clasp with effort vain

 20

 Thou then as now no less wilt be my life
 And I shall know it better than before
 Praying and trusting hoping claiming more
 From effort vain sick foil and bootless strife
 I shall with childness fresh look up to thee
 Thou seeing thy child with age encumbered sore
 Wilt round him bend thine arm more carefully

 21

 And when grim Death doth take me by the throat
 Thou wilt have pity on thy handiwork
 Thou wilt not let him on my suffering gloat
 But draw my soul outgladder than man or boy
 When thy saved creatures from the narrow ark
 Rushed out and leaped and laughed and cried for joy
 And the great rainbow strode across the dark

 22

 Against my fears my doubts my ignorance
 I trust in thee O father of my Lord
 The world went on in this same broken dance
 When worn and mocked he trusted and adored
 I too will trust and gather my poor best
 To face the truthfaced false So in his nest
 I shall awake at length a little scarred and scored

 23

 Things cannot look all right so long as I
 Am not all right who seetherefore not right
 Can see The lamp within sends out the light
 Which shows the things and if its rays go wry
 Or are not white they must part show a lie
 The man halfcured did men not trees conclude
 Because he moving saw what else had seemed a wood

 24

 Give me take from me as thou wilt I learn
 Slowly and stubbornly I learn to yield
 With a strange hopefulness As from the field
 Of hardfought battle won the victor chief
 Turns thankfully although his heart do yearn
 So from my old things to thy new I turn
 With sad theetrusting heart and not in grief

 25

 If with my father I did wander free
 Floating oer hill and field whereer we would
 And lighting on the sward before the door
 Strange faces through the windowpanes should see
 And strange feet standing where the loved had stood
 The dear old place theirs all as ours before
 Should I be sorrowful father having thee

 26

 So Lord if thou takst from me all the rest
 Thyself with each resumption drawing nigher
 It shall but hurt me as the thorn of the briar
 When I reach to the pale flower in its breast
 To have thee Lord is to have all thy best
 Holding it by its very life divine
 To let my friends hand go and take his heart in mine

 27

 Take from me leisure all familiar places
 Take all the lovely things of earth and air
 Take from me books take all my precious faces
 Take words melodious and their songful linking
 Take scents and sounds and all thy outsides fair
 Draw nearer taking and to my sober thinking
 Thou bringst them nearer all and ready to my prayer

 28

 No place on earth henceforth I shall count strange
 For every place belongeth to my Christ
 I will go calm whereer thou bidst me range
 Whoeer my neighbour thou art still my nighest
 Oh my hearts life my owner will of my being
 Into my soul thou every moment diest
 In thee my life thus evermore decreeing

 29

 What though things change and pass nor come again
 Thou the lifeheart of all things changest never
 The sun shines on the fair clouds turn to rain
 And glad the earth with many a spring and river
 The hearts that answer change with chill and shiver
 That mourn the past sadsick with hopeless pain
 They know not thee our changeless heart and brain

 30

 My halting words will some day turn to song
 Some faroff day in holy other times
 The melody now prisoned in my rimes
 Will one day break aloft and from the throng
 Of wrestling thoughts and words spring up the air
 As from the flower its colours sweet despair
 Issues in odour and the skys low levels climbs

 31

 My surgent thought shoots larklike up to thee
 Thou like the heaven art all about the lark
 Whatever I surmise or know in me
 Idea or but symbol on the dark
 Is living working thoughtcreating power
 In thee the timeless father of the hour
 I am thy book thy songthy child would be

 THOU art of this world Christ Thou knowst it all
 Thou knowst our evens our morns our red and gray
 How moons and hearts and seasons rise and fall
 How we grow weary plodding on the way
 Of future joy how present pain bereaves
 Rounding us with a dark of mere decay
 Tossed with a drift Of summerfallen leaves

 2

 Thou knowest all our weeping fainting striving
 Thou knowst how very hard it is to be
 How hard to rouse faint will not yet reviving
 To do the pure thing trusting all to thee
 To hold thou art there for all no face we see
 How hard to think through cold and dark and dearth
 That thou art nearer now than when eyeseen on earth

 3

 Have pity on us for the look of things
 When blank denial stares us in the face
 Although the serpent mask have lied before
 It fascinates the bird that darkling sings
 And numbs the little prayerbirds beating wings
 For how believe thee somewhere in blank space
 If through the darkness come no knocking to our door

 4

 If we might sit until the darkness go
 Possess our souls in patience perhaps we might
 But there is always something to be done
 And no heart left to do it To and fro
 The dull thought surges as the driven waves fight
 In gulfy channels Oh victorious one
 Give strength to rise go out and meet thee in the night

 5

 Wake thou that sleepest rise up from the dead
 And Christ will give thee light I do not know
 What sleep is what is death or what is light
 But I am waked enough to feel a woe
 To rise and leave death Stumbling through the night
 To my dim lattice O calling Christ I go
 And out into the dark look for thy starcrowned head

 6

 There are who come to me and write and send
 Whom I would love giving good things to all
 But friendthat name I cannot on them spend
 Tis from the centre of selflove they call
 For cherishingfor which they first must know
 How to be still and take the seat thats low
 When Lord shall I be fitwhen wilt thou call me friend

 7

 Wilt thou not one day Lord In all my wrong
 Selflove and weakness laziness and fear
 This one thing I can say I am content
 To be and have what in thy heart I am meant
 To be and have In my best times I long
 After thy will and think it gloriousdear
 Even in my worst perforce my will to thine is bent

 8

 My God I look to thee for tenderness
 Such as I could not seek from any man
 Or in a human heart fancy or plan
 A something deepest prayer will not express
 Lord with thy breath blow on my beings fires
 Until even to the soul with selflove wan
 I yield the primal love that no return desires

 9

 Only no word of mine must ever foster
 The self that in a brothers bosom gnaws
 I may not fondle failing nor the boaster
 Encourage with the breath of my applause
 Weakness needs pity sometimes loves rebuke
 Strength only sympathy deserves and draws
 And grows by every faithful loving look

 10

 Tis but as men draw nigh to thee my Lord
 They can draw nigh each other and not hurt
 Who with the gospel of thy peace are girt
 The belt from which doth hang the Spirits sword
 Shall breathe on dead bones and the bones shall live
 Sweet poison to the evil self shall give
 And clean themselves lift men clean from the mire abhorred

 11

 My Lord I have no clothes to come to thee
 My shoes are pierced and broken with the road
 I am torn and weathered wounded with the goad
 And soiled with tugging at my weary load
 The more I need thee A very prodigal
 I stagger into thy presence Lord of me
 One look my Christ and at thy feet I fall

 12

 Why should I still hang back like one in a dream
 Who vainly strives to clothe himself aright
 That in great presence he may seemly seem
 Why call up feelingdress me in the faint
 Worn faded castoff nimbus of some saint
 Why of old mood bring back a ghostly gleam
 While there He waits loves heart and losss blight

 13

 Son of the Father elder brother mine
 See thy poor brothers plight See how he stands
 Defiled and feeble hanging down his hands
 Make me clean brother with thy burning shine
 From thy rich treasures householder divine
 Bring forth fair garments old and new I pray
 And like thy brother dress me in the old homebred way

 14

 My prayerbird was coldwould not away
 Although I set it on the edge of the nest
 Then I bethought me of the story old
 Lovefact or loving fable thou knowst best
 How when the children had made sparrows of clay
 Thou madst them birds with wings to flutter and fold
 Take Lord my prayer in thy hand and make it pray

 15

 My poor claysparrow seems turned to a stone
 And from my heart will neither fly nor run
 I cannot feel as thou and I both would
 But Father I am willingmake me good
 What art thou father for but to help thy son
 Look deep yet deeper in my heart and there
 Beyond where I can feel read thou the prayer

 16

 Oh what it were to be right sure of thee
 Sure that thou art and the same as thy son Jesus
 Oh faith is deeper wider than the sea
 Yea than the blue of heaven that ever flees us
 Yet simple as the cry of sorehurt child
 Or as his shout with sudden gladness wild
 When home from school he runs till morn set free

 17

 If I were sure thou Father verily art
 True father of the Nazarene as true
 Sure as I am of my wifes shielding heart
 Sure as of sunrise in the watching blue
 Sure as I am that I do eat and drink
 And have a heart to love and laugh and think
 Meseems in flame the joy might from my body start

 18

 But I must know thee in a deeper way
 Than any of these ways or know thee not
 My heart at peace far loftier proof must lay
 Than if the wind thou me the wave didst roll
 Than if I lay before thee a sunny spot
 Or knew thee as the body knows its soul
 Or even as the part doth know its perfect whole

 19

 There is no word to tell how I must know thee
 No wind clasped ever a low meadowflower
 So close that as to nearness it could show thee
 No rainbow so makes one the sun and shower
 A something with thee I am a nothing fro thee
 Because I am not save as I am in thee
 My soul is ever setting out to win thee

 20

 I know not howfor that I first must know thee
 I know I know thee not as I would know thee
 For my heart burns like theirs that did not know him
 Till he broke bread and therein they must know him
 I know thee knowing that I do not know thee
 Nor ever shall till one with me I know thee
 Even as thy son the eternal man doth know thee

 21

 Creation under me in and above
 Slopes upward from the base a pyramid
 On whose point I shall stand at last and love
 From the first rush of vapour at thy will
 To the last poetword that darkness chid
 Thou hast been sending up creations hill
 To lift thy souls aloft in faithful Godhead free

 22

 I think my thought and fancy I think thee
 Lord wake me up rend swift my coffinplanks
 I pray thee let me livealive and free
 My soul will break forth in melodious thanks
 Aware at last what thou wouldst have it be
 When thy life shall be light in me and when
 My life to thine is answer and amen

 23

 How oft I say the same things in these lines
 Even as a man buried in during dark
 Turns ever where the edge of twilight shines
 Prays ever towards the vague eternal mark
 Or as the sleeper having dreamed he drinks
 Back straightway into thirstful dreaming sinks
 So turns my will to thee for thee still longs still pines

 24

 The mortal man all careful wise and troubled
 The eternal child in the nursery doth keep
 Tomorrow on today the man heaps doubled
 The child laughs hopeful even in his sleep
 The man rebukes the child for foolish trust
 The child replies Thy care is for poor dust
 Be still and let me wake that thou mayst sleep

 25

 Till I am one with oneness manifold
 I must breed contradiction strife and doubt
 Things tread Thy courtlook realtake proving hold
 My Christ is not yet grown to cast them out
 Alas to me falsejudging twixt the twain
 The Unseen oft fancy seems while all about
 The Seen doth lord it with a mighty train

 26

 But when the Will hath learned obedience royal
 He straight will set the child upon the throne
 To whom the seen things all grown instant loyal
 Will gather to his feet in homage prone
 The child their master they have ever known
 Then shall the visible fabric plainly lean
 On a Reality that never can be seen

 27

 Thy ways are wonderful maker of men
 Thou gavest me a child and I have fed
 And clothed and loved her many a growing year
 Lo now a friend of months draws gently near
 And claims her futureall beyond his ken
 There he hath never loved her nor hath led
 She weeps and moans but turns and leaves her home so dear

 28

 She leaves but not forsakes Oft in the night
 Oft at midday when all is still around
 Sudden will rise in dim pathetic light
 Some childish memory of household bliss
 Or sorrow by loves service robed and crowned
 Rich in his love she yet will sometimes miss
 The mothers folding arms the mothers sealing kiss

 29

 Then first I think our eldestborn although
 Loving devoted tender watchful dear
 The innermost of homebred love shall know
 Yea when at last the janitor draws near
 A still pale joy will through the darkness go
 At thought of lying in those arms again
 Which once were heaven enough for any pain

 30

 By love doth love grow mighty in its love
 Once thou shalt love us child as we love thee
 Father of loves is it not thy decree
 That by our long farwandering remove
 From thee our life our home our being blest
 We learn at last to love thee true and best
 And rush with all our loves back to thy infinite rest





DECEMBER

 1

 I AM a little weary of my life
 Not thy life blessed Father Or the blood
 Too slowly laves the coral shores of thought
 Or I am weary of weariness and strife
 Open my soulgates to thy living flood
 I ask not larger heartthrobs vigourfraught
 I pray thy presence with strong patience rife

 2

 I will what thou willstonly keep me sure
 That thou art willing call to me now and then
 So ceasing to enjoy I shall endure
 With perfect patiencewilling beyond my ken
 Beyond my love beyond my thinking scope
 Willing to be because thy will is pure
 Willing thy will beyond all bounds of hope

 3

 This weariness of mine may it not come
 From something that doth need no setting right
 Shall fruit be blamed if it hang wearily
 A day before it perfected drop plumb
 To the sad earth from off its nursing tree
 Ripeness must always come with loss of might
 The weary evening fall before the resting night

 4

 Hither if I have come through earth and air
 Through fire and waterI am not of them
 Born in the darkness what fairflashing gem
 Would to the earth go back and nestle there
 Not of this world this world my life doth hem
 What if I weary then and look to the door
 Because my unknown life is swelling at the core

 5

 All winged things came from the waters first
 Airward still many a one from the water springs
 In dens and caves windloving things are nursed
 I lie like unhatched bird upfolded dumb
 While all the air is trembling with the hum
 Of songs and beating hearts and whirring wings
 That call my slumbering life to wake to happy things

 6

 I lay last night and knew not why I was sad
 Tis well with God I said and he is the truth
 Let that content meTis not strength nor youth
 Nor buoyant health nor a heart merrymad
 That makes the fact of things wherein men live
 He is the life and doth my life outgive
 In him there is no gloom but all is solemnglad

 7

 I said to myself Lo I lie in a dream
 Of separation where there comes no sign
 My waking life is hid with Christ in God
 Where all is true and potentfact divine
 I will not heed the thing that doth but seem
 I will be quiet as lark upon the sod
 Gods will the seed shall rest in me the pod

 8

 And when that will shall blossomthen my God
 There will be jubilation in a world
 The glad lark soaring heavenward from the sod
 Up the swift spiral of its own song whirled
 Never such jubilation wild outpoured
 As from my soul will break at thy feet Lord
 Like a great tide from seaheart shoreward hurled

 9

 For then thou wilt be able then at last
 To glad me as thou hungerest to do
 Then shall thy life my heart all open find
 A thoroughfare to thy great spiritwind
 Then shall I rest within thy holy vast
 One with the bliss of the eternal mind
 And all creation rise in me created new

 10

 What makes thy being a bliss shall then make mind
 For I shall love as thou and love in thee
 Then shall I have whatever I desire
 My every faintest wish being all divine
 Power thou wilt give me to work mightily
 Even as my Lord leading thy low men nigher
 With dance and song to cast their best upon thy fire

 11

 Then shall I live such an essential life
 That a mere flower will then to me unfold
 More bliss than now grandest orchestral strife
 By love made and obedience humblebold
 I shall straight through its window God behold
 God I shall feed on thee thy creature blest
 With very beingwork at one with sweetest rest

 12

 Give me a world to part for praise and sunder
 The brooks be bells the winds in caverns dumb
 Wake fife and flute and flageolet and voice
 The fireshook earth itself be the great drum
 And let the air the regions bass out thunder
 The firs be violins the reeds hautboys
 Rivers seas icebergs fill the great score up and under

 13

 But rather dost thou hear the blundered words
 Of breathing creatures the musiclowing herds
 Of thy great cattle thy softbleating sheep
 Oerhovered by the trebles of thy birds
 Whose Christpraised carelessness songfills the deep
 Still rather a childs talk who apart doth hide him
 And make a tent for God to come and sit beside him

 14

 This is not life this being is not enough
 But thou art life and thou hast life for me
 Thou madst the wormto cast the wormy slough
 And fly abroada glory flit and flee
 Thou hast me statuelike hewn in the rough
 Meaning at last to shape me perfectly
 Lord thou hast called me fourth I turn and call on thee

 15

 Tis thine to make mine to rejoice in thine
 As hungering for his mothers face and eyes
 The child throws wide the door back to the wall
 I run to thee the refuge from poor lies
 Lean dogs behind me whimper yelp and whine
 Life lieth ever sick Deaths writhing thrall
 In slavery endless hopeless and supine

 16

 The life that hath not willed itself to be
 Must clasp the life that willed and be at peace
 Or like a leaf windblown through chaos flee
 A lifehusk into which the demons go
 And work their will and drive it to and fro
 A thing that neither is nor yet can cease
 Which uncreation can alone release

 17

 But when I turn and grasp the making hand
 And will the making will with confidence
 I ride the crest of the creationwave
 Helpless no more no more existence slave
 In the heart of loves creating fire I stand
 And lovepossessed in heart and soul and sense
 Take up the making share the making Master gave

 18

 That man alone who does the Fathers works
 Can be the Fathers son yea only he
 Who sonlike can create can ever be
 Who with God wills not is no son not free
 O Father send the demondoubt that lurks
 Behind the hope out into the abyss
 Who trusts in knowledge all its good shall miss

 19

 Thy beasts are sinless and do live before thee
 Thy child is sinful and must run to thee
 Thy angels sin not and in peace adore thee
 But I must will or never more be free
 I from thy heart came how can I ignore thee
 Back to my home I hurry haste and flee
 There I shall dwell lovepraising evermore thee

 20

 My holy self thy pure ideal lies
 Calm in thy bosom which it cannot leave
 My self unholy no ideal hies
 Hither and thither gathering store to grieve
 Not now O Father now it mounts it flies
 To join the true self in thy heart that waits
 And one with it be one with all the heavenly mates

 21

 Trusting thee Christ I kneel and clasp thy knee
 Cast myself down and kiss thy brotherfeet
 One self thou and the Fathers thought of thee
 Ideal son thou hast left the perfect home
 Ideal brother to seek thy brothers come
 Thou knowst our angels all Gods children sweet
 And of each two wilt make one holy child complete

 22

 To a slow end I draw these daily words
 Nor think such words often to write again
 Rather as light the power to me affords
 Christs new and old would to my friends unbind
 Through words he spoke help to his thought behind
 Unveil the heart with which he drew his men
 Set forth his rule oer devils animals corn and wind

 23

 I do remember how one time I thought
 God must be lonelyoh so lonely lone
 I will be very good to himah nought
 Can reach the heart of his great loneliness
 My whole heart I will bring him with a moan
 That I may not come nearer I will lie prone
 Before the awful loveliness in loneliness excess

 24

 A God must have a God for company
 And lo thou hast the SonGod to thy friend
 Thou honourst his obedience he thy law
 Into thy secret lifewill he doth see
 Thou foldst him round in live love perfectly
 One two without beginning without end
 In love life strength and truth perfect without a flaw

 25

 Thou hast not made or taught me Lord to care
 For times and seasonsbut this one glad day
 Is the blue sapphire clasping all the lights
 That flash in the girdle of the year so fair
 When thou wast born a man because alway
 Thou wast and art a man through all the flights
 Of thought and time and thousandfold creations play

 26

 We all are lonely Makereach a soul
 Shut in by itself a sundered atom of thee
 No two yet loved themselves into a whole
 Even when we weep together we are two
 Of two to make one which yet two shall be
 Is thy creations problem deep and true
 To which thou only holdst the happy hurting clue

 27

 No less than thou O Father do we need
 A God to friend each lonely one of us
 As touch not in the sack two grains of seed
 Touch no two hearts in great worlds populous
 Outside the making God we cannot meet
 Him he has made our brother homeward thus
 To find our kin we first must turn our wandering feet

 28

 It must be possible that the soul made
 Should absolutely meet the soul that makes
 Then in that bearing soul meet every other
 There also born each sister and each brother
 Lord till I meet thee thus life is delayed
 I am not I until that morning breaks
 Not I until my consciousness eternal wakes

 29

 Again I shall behold thee daughter true
 The hour will come when I shall hold thee fast
 In Gods name loving thee all through and through
 Somewhere in his grand thought this waits for us
 Then shall I see a smile not like thy last
 For that great thing which came when all was past
 Was not a smile but Gods peace glorious

 30

 Twilight of the transfigurationjoy
 Gleamfaced pureeyed strongwilled highhearted boy
 Hardly thy life clear forth of heaven was sent
 Ere it broke out into a smile and went
 So swift thy growth so true thy goalward bent
 Thou child and sage inextricably blent
 Wilt one day teach thy father in some heavenly tent

 31

 Go my beloved children live your life
 Wounded faint bleeding never yield the strife
 Stunned fallenawake arise and fight again
 Before you victory stands with shining train
 Of hopes not credible until they are
 Beyond morass and mountain swells the star
 Of perfect lovethe home of longing heart and brain

Section 2 Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergtm

Project Gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
