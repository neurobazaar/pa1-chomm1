BALLADS OF A BOHEMIAN




Prelude


 Alas upon some starry height
 The Gods of Excellence to please
 This hand of mine will never smite
 The Harp of High Serenities
 Mere minstrel of the street am I
 To whom a careless coin you fling
 But who beneath the bitter sky
 Bluelipped yet insolent of eye
 Can shrill a song of Spring
 A song of merry mansard days
 The cheery chimneytops among
 Of rolics and of roundelays
 When we were young    when we were young
 A song of love and lilac nights
 Of wit of wisdom and of wine
 Of Folly whirling on the Heights
 Of hunger and of hope divine
 Of Blanche Suzette and Celestine
 And all that gay and tender band
 Who shared with us the fat the lean
 The hazard of Illusionland
 When scores of Philistines we slew
 As mightily with brush and pen
 We sought to make the world anew
 And scorned the gods of other men
 When we were fools divinely wise
 Who held it rapturous to strive
 When Art was sacred in our eyes
 And it was Heavn to be alive   

 O days of glamor glory truth
 To you tonight I raise my glass
 O freehold of immortal youth
 Bohemia the lost alas
 O laughing lads who led the romp
 Respectable youve grown Im told
 Your heads you bow to power and pomp
 Youve learned to know the worth of gold
 O merry maids who shared our cheer
 Your eyes are dim your locks are gray
 And as you scrub I sadly fear
 Your daughters speed the dance today
 O windmill land and crescent moon
 O Columbine and Pierrette
 To you my old guitar I tune
 Ere I forget ere I forget   

 So come good men who toil and tire
 Who smoke and sip the kindly cup
 Ring round about the tavern fire
 Ere yet you drink your liquor up
 And hear my simple songs of earth
 Of youth and truth and living things
 Of poverty and proper mirth
 Of rags and rich imaginings
 Of cockahoop blueheavened days
 Of hearts elate and eager breath
 Of wonder worship pity praise
 Of sorrow sacrifice and death
 Of lusting laughter passion pain
 Of lights that lure and dreams that thrall   
 And if a golden word I gain
 Oh kindly folks God save you all
 And if you shake your heads in blame   
 Good friends God love you all the same





BOOK ONE  SPRING




I


Montparnasse

April 1914

All day the sun has shone into my little attic a bitter sunshine that
brightened yet did not warm And so as I toiled and toiled doggedly
enough many were the looks I cast at the three faggots I had saved to
cook my evening meal Now however my supper is over my pipe alight
and as I stretch my legs before the embers I have at last a glow of
comfort a glimpse of peace




My Garret



 Here is my Garret up five flights of stairs
 Heres where I deal in dreams and ply in fancies
 Here is the wondershop of all my wares
 My sounding sonnets and my red romances
 Heres where I challenge Fate and ring my rhymes
 And grope at gloryaye and starve at times

 Here is my Stronghold stout of heart am I
 Greeting each dawn as songful as a linnet
 And when at night on yon poor bed I lie
 Blessing the world and every soul thats in it
 Heres where I thank the Lord no shadow bars
 My skylights vision of the valiant stars

 Here is my Palace tapestried with dreams
 Ah though tonight ten _sous_ are all my treasure
 While in my gaze immortal beauty gleams
 Am I not dowered with wealth beyond all measure
 Though in my ragged coat my songs I sing
 King of my soul I envy not the king

 Here is my Haven its so quiet here
 Only the scratch of pen the candles flutter
 Shabby and bare and small but O how dear
 Mark youmy table with my work aclutter
 My shelf of tattered books along the wall
 My bed my broken chairthats nearly all

 Only four faded walls yet mine all mine
 Oh you fine folks a pauper scorns your pity
 Look where above me stars of rapture shine
 See where below me gleams the siren city   
 Am I not richa millionaire no less
 If wealth be told in terms of Happiness



Ten _sous_    I think one can sing best of poverty when one is
holding it at arms length Im sure that when I wrote these lines
fortune had for a moment tweaked me by the nose Tonight however I
am truly down to ten _sous_ It is for that I have stayed in my room
all day rolled in my blankets and clutching my pen with clammy fingers
I must work work work I must finish my book before poverty crushes
me I am not only writing for my living but for my life Even today my
Muse was mutinous For hours and hours anxiously I stared at a paper
that was blank nervously I paced up and down my garret bitterly I
flung myself on my bed Then suddenly it all came Line after line I
wrote with hardly a halt So I made another of my Ballads of the
Boulevards Here it is




Julot the _Apache_



 Youve heard of Julot the _apache_ and Gigolette his _mome_   
 Montmartre was their huntingground but Belville was their home
 A little chap just like a boy with smudgy black mustache
 Yet there was nothing juvenile in Julot the _apache_
 From head to heel as tough as steel as nimble as a cat
 With every trick of twist and kick a master of _savate_
 And Gigolette was tall and fair as stupid as a cow
 With three combs in the greasy hair she banged upon her brow
 Youd see her on the Place Pigalle on any afternoon
 A primitive and strapping wench as brazen as the moon
 And yet there is a tale thats told of Clichy after dark
 And two _gendarmes_ who swung their arms with Julot for a mark
 And oh but theyd have got him too they banged and blazed away
 When like a flash a woman leapt between them and their prey
 She took the medicine meant for him she came down with a crash   
 Quick now and make your getaway O Julot the _apache_   
 But no He turned ran swiftly back his arms around her met
 They nabbed him sobbing like a kid and kissing Gigolette

 Now Im a reckless painter chap who loves a jamboree
 And one night in Cyranos bar I got upon a spree
 And there were trollops all about and crooks of every kind
 But though the place was reeling round I didnt seem to mind
 Till down I sank and all was blank when in the bleary dawn
 I woke up in my studio to findmy money gone
 Three hundred francs Id scraped and squeezed to pay my quarters rent
 Some one has pinched my wad I wailed it never has been spent
 And as I racked my brains to seek how I could raise some more
 Before my cruel landlord kicked me cowering from the door
 A knock    Come in I gruffly groaned I did not raise my head
 Then lo I heard a husky voice a swift and silky tread
 You got so blind last night _mon vieux_ I collared all your cash
 Three hundred francs    There _Nom de Dieu_ said Julot the _apache_

 And that was how I came to know Julot and Gigolette
 And we would talk and drink a _bock_ and smoke a cigarette
 And I would meditate upon the artistry of crime
 And he would tell of cracking cribs and cops and doing time
 Or else when he was flush of funds hed carelessly explain
 Hed biffed some bloated _bourgeois_ on the border of the Seine
 So gentle and polite he was just like a man of peace
 And not a desperado and the terror of the police

 Now one day in a _bistro_ thats behind the Place Vendome
 I came on Julot the _apache_ and Gigolette his _mome_
 And as they looked so very grave says I to them says I
 Come on and have a little glass its good to rinse the eye
 You both look mighty serious youve something on the heart
 Ah yes said Julot the _apache_ weve something to impart
 When such things come to folks like us it isnt very gay   
 Its Gigoletteshe tells me that a _gosse_ is on the way
 Then Gigolette she looked at me with eyes like stones of gall
 If we were honest folks said she I wouldnt mind at all
 But then    you know the life we lead well anyway I mean
 That is providing its a girl to call her Angeline
 Cheer up said I its all in life Theres gold within the dross
 Come on well drink another _verre_ to Angeline the _gosse_

 And so the weary winter passed and then one April morn
 The worthy Julot came at last to say the babe was born
 Id like to chuck it in the Seine he sourly snarled and yet
 I guess Ill have to let it live because of Gigolette
 I only laughed for sure I saw his spite was all a bluff
 And he was prouder than a prince behind his manner gruff
 Yet every day hed blast the brat with curses deep and grim
 And swear to me that Gigolette no longer thought of _him_
 And then one night he dropped the mask his eyes were sick with dread
 And when I offered him a smoke he groaned and shook his head
 Im all upset its Angeline    shes covered with a rash   
 Shell maybe die my little _gosse_ cried Julot the _apache_

 But Angeline I joy to say came through the test all right
 Though Julot so they tell me watched beside her day and night
 And when I saw him next says he Come up and dine with me
 Well buy a beefsteak on the way a bottle and some _brie_
 And so I had a merry night within his humble home
 And laughed with Angeline the _gosse_ and Gigolette the _mome_
 And every time that Julot used a word the least obscene
 How Gigolette would frown at him and point to Angeline
 Oh such a little innocent with hair of silken floss
 I do not wonder they were proud of Angeline the _gosse_
 And when her arms were round his neck then Julot says to me
 I must work harder now _mon vieux_ since Ive to work for three
 He worked so very hard indeed the police dropped in one day
 And for a year behind the bars they put him safe away

 So dark and silent now their home theyd goneI wondered where
 Till in a laundry near I saw a child with shining hair
 And oer the tub a strapping wench her arms in soapy foam
 Lo it was Angeline the _gosse_ and Gigolette the _mome_
 And so I kept an eye on them and saw that all went right
 Until at last came Julot home half crazy with delight
 And when hed kissed them both says he Ive had my fill this time
 Im on the honest now I am Im all fed up with crime
 You mark my words the page I turn is going to be clean
 I swear it on the head of her my little Angeline

 And so to finish up my tale this morning as I strolled
 Along the boulevard I heard a voice I knew of old
 I saw a rosy little man with walruslike mustache   
 I stopped I stared    By all the gods twas Julot the _apache_
 Im in the garden way he said and doing mighty well
 Ive half an acre under glass and heaps of truck to sell
 Come out and see Oh come my friend on Sunday wet or shine   
 Say_its the First Communion of that little girl of mine_

_Chez Moi_ Montparnasse

_The same evening_

Today is an anniversary A year ago today I kicked over an office
stool and came to Paris thinking to make a living by my pen I was
twenty then and in my pocket I had twenty pounds Of that my ten
_sous_ are all that remain And so tonight I am going to spend them
not prudently on bread but prodigally on beer

As I stroll down the Boul Mich the lingering light has all the
exquisite tenderness of violet the trees are in their first translucent
green beneath them the lamps are lit with purest gold and from the
Little Luxembourg comes a silver jangle of tiny voices Taking the gay
side of the street I enter a cafe Although it isnt its true name I
choose to call my cafe




_LEscargot DOr_



 O Tavern of the Golden Snail
 Ten _sous_ have I so Ill regale
 Ten _sous_ your amber brew to sip
 Eight for the _bock_ and two the tip
 And so Ill sit the evening long
 And smoke my pipe and watch the throng
 The giddy crowd that drains and drinks
 Ill watch it quiet as a sphinx
 And who among them all shall buy
 For ten poor _sous_ such joy as I
 As I who snugly tucked away
 Look on it all as on a play
 A frolic scene of love and fun
 To please an audience of One

 O Tavern of the Golden Snail
 Youve stuff indeed for many a tale
 All eyes all ears I nothing miss
 Two lovers lean to clasp and kiss
 The merry students sing and shout
 The nimble _garcons_ dart about
 Lo here come Mimi and Musette
 With _Sil vous plait une cigarette_
 Marcel and Rudolf Shaunard too
 Behold the old rapscallion crew
 With flowing tie and shaggy head   
 Who says Bohemia is dead
 Oh shades of Murger prank and clown
 And I will watch and write it down

 O Tavern of the Golden Snail
 What crackling throats have gulped your ale
 What sons of Fame from far and near
 Have glowed and mellowed in your cheer
 Within this corner where I sit
 Banville and Coppee clashed their wit
 And hither too to dream and drain
 And drown despair came poor Verlaine
 Here Wilde would talk and Synge would muse
 Maybe like me with just ten _sous_
 Ah one is lucky is one not
 With ghosts so rare to drain a pot
 So may your custom never fail
 O Tavern of the Golden Snail



There my pipe is out Let me light it again and consider I have no
illusions about myself I am not fool enough to think I am a poet but
I have a knack of rhyme and I love to make verses Mine is a tootling
tinwhistle music Humbly and afar I follow in the footsteps of Praed
and Lampson of Field and Riley hoping that in time my Muse may bring
me bread and butter So far however it has been all kicks and no
coppers And tonight I am at the end of my tether I wish I knew where
tomorrows breakfast was coming from Well since rhymings been my
ruin let me rhyme to the bitter end




It Is Later Than You Think



 Lone amid the cafes cheer
 Sad of heart am I tonight
 Dolefully I drink my beer
 But no single line I write
 Theres the wretched rent to pay
 Yet I glower at pen and ink
 Oh inspire me Muse I pray
 _It is later than you think_

 Hello theres a pregnant phrase
 Bravo let me write it down
 Hold it with a hopeful gaze
 Gauge it with a fretful frown
 Tune it to my lyric lyre   
 Ah upon starvations brink
 How the words are dark and dire
 It is later than you think

 Weigh them well    Behold yon band
 Students drinking by the door
 Madly merry _bock_ in hand
 Saucers stacked to mark their score
 Get you gone you jolly scamps
 Let your parting glasses clink
 Seek your long neglected lamps
 It is later than you think

 Look again yon dainty blonde
 All allure and golden grace
 Oh so willing to respond
 Should you turn a smiling face
 Play your part poor pretty doll
 Feast and frolic pose and prink
 Theres the Morgue to end it all
 And its later than you think

 Yons a playwrightmark his face
 Puffed and purple tense and tired
 Pashalike he holds his place
 Hated envied and admired
 How you gobble life my friend
 Wine and woman soft and pink
 Well each tether has its end
 Sir its later than you think

 See yon living scarecrow pass
 With a wild and wolfish stare
 At each empty absinthe glass
 As if he saw Heaven there
 Poor damned wretch to end your pain
 There is still the Greater Drink
 Yonder waits the sanguine Seine   
 It is later than you think

 Lastly you who read aye you
 Who this very line may scan
 Think of all you planned to do   
 Have you done the best you can
 See the tavern lights are low
 Blacks the night and how you shrink
 God and is it time to go
 Ah the clock is always slow
 It is later than you think
 Sadly later than you think
 Far far later than you think



Scarcely do I scribble that last line on the back of an old envelope
when a voice hails me It is a fellow freelance a shortstory man
called MacBean He is having a feast of _Marennes_ and he asks me to
join him

MacBean is a Scotsman with the soul of an Irishman He has a keen
lean spectacled face and if it were not for his gray hair he might be
taken for a student of theology However there is nothing of the
Puritan in MacBean He loves wine and women and money melts in his
fingers

He has lived so long in the Quarter he looks at life from the Parisian
angle His knowledge of literature is such that he might be a Professor
but he would rather be a vagabond of letters We talk shop We discuss
the American short story but MacBean vows they do these things better
in France He says that some of the _contes_ printed every day in the
_Journal_ are worthy of Maupassant After that he buys more beer and
we roam airily over the fields of literature plucking here and there a
blossom of quotation A fine talk vivid and eager It puts me into a
kind of glow

MacBean pays the bill from a handful of big notes and the thought of my
own empty pockets for a moment damps me However when we rise to go
it is well after midnight and I am in a pleasant daze The rest of the
evening may be summed up in the following jingle




Noctambule



 Zut its two oclock
 See the lights are jumping
 Finish up your _bock_
 Time we all were humping
 Waiters stack the chairs
 Pile them on the tables
 Let us to our lairs
 Underneath the gables

 Up the old Boul Mich
 Climb with steps erratic
 Steady    how I wish
 I was in my attic
 Full am I with cheer
 In my heart the joy stirs
 Couldnt be the beer
 Must have been the oysters

 In obscene array
 Garbage cans spill over
 How I wish that they
 Smelled as sweet as clover
 Charing women wait
 Cafes drop their shutters
 Rats perambulate
 Up and down the gutters

 Down the darkened street
 Market carts are creeping
 Horse with wary feet
 Redfaced driver sleeping
 Loads of vivid greens
 Carrots leeks potatoes
 Cabbages and beans
 Turnips and tomatoes

 Pair of dapper chaps
 Cigarettes and sashes
 Stare at me perhaps
 Desperate _Apaches_
 Neednt bother me
 Jolly well you know it
 _Parceque je suis
 Quartier Latin poete_

 Give you villanelles
 Madrigals and lyrics
 Ballades and rondels
 Odes and panegyrics
 Poet pinched and poor
 Pricked by cold and hunger
 Troubles troubadour
 Miserys balladmonger

 Think how queer it is
 Every move Im making
 Cosmic gravitys
 Center I am shaking
 Oh how droll to feel
 As I now am feeling
 Even as I reel
 All the world is reeling

 Reeling too the stars
 Neptune and Uranus
 Jupiter and Mars
 Mercury and Venus
 Suns and moons with me
 As Im homeward straying
 All in sympathy
 Swaying swaying swaying

 Lord Ive got a head
 Well its not surprising
 I must gain my bed
 Ere the sun be rising
 When the merry lark
 In the sky is soaring
 Ill refuse to hark
 Ill be snoring snoring

 Strike a sulphur match   
 Ha at last my garret
 Fumble at the latch
 Close the door and bar it
 Bed you graciously
 Wait despite my scorning   
 So bibaciously
 Mad old world good morning

My Garret

Montparnasse April




Insomnia



 Heigh ho to sleep I vainly try
 Since twelve I havent closed an eye
 And now its three and as I lie
 From Notre Dame to St Denis
 The bells of Paris chime to me
 Youre young they say and strong and free

 I do not turn with sighs and groans
 To ease my limbs to rest my bones
 As if my bed were stuffed with stones
 No peevish murmur tips my tongue
 Ah no for every sound upflung
 Says Lad youre free and strong and young

 And so beneath the sheets caress
 My body purrs with happiness
 Joy bubbles in my veins    Ah yes
 My very blood that leaps along
 Is chiming in a joyous song
 Because Im young and free and strong



Maybe it is the springtide I am so happy I am afraid The sense of
living fills me with exultation I want to sing to dance I am
dithyrambic with delight



 I think the moon must be to blame
 It fills the room with fairy flame
 It paints the wall it seems to pour
 A dappled flood upon the floor
 I rise and through the window stare   
 Ye gods how marvelously fair
 From Montrouge to the Martyrs Hill
 A silver city rapt and still
 Dim drowsy deeps of opal haze
 And spire and dome in diamond blaze
 The little lisping leaves of spring
 Like sequins softly glimmering
 Each roof a plaque of argent sheen
 A gauzy gulf the space between
 Each chimneytop a thing of grace
 Where merry moonbeams prank and chase
 And all that sordid was and mean
 Just Beauty deathless and serene

 O magic city of a dream
 From glory unto glory gleam
 And I will gaze and pity those
 Who on their pillows drowse and doze   
 And as Ive nothing else to do
 Of tea Ill make a rousing brew
 And coax my pipes until they croon
 And chant a ditty to the moon



There my tea is black and strong Inspiration comes with every sip
Now for the moon



 The moon peeped out behind the hill
 As yellow as an apricot
 Then up and up it climbed until
 Into the sky it fairly got
 The sky was vast and violet
 The poor moon seemed to faint in fright
 And pale it grew and paler yet
 Like fine old silver rinsed and bright
 And yet it climbed so bravely on
 Until it mounted heavenhigh
 Then earthward it serenely shone
 A silver sovereign of the sky
 A bland sultana of the night
 Surveying realms of lily light




Moon Song



 A child saw in the morning skies
 The dissipatedlooking moon
 And opened wide her big blue eyes
 And cried Look look my lost balloon
 And clapped her rosy hands with glee
 Quick mother Bring it back to me

 A poet in a lilied pond
 Espied the moons reflected charms
 And ravished by that beauty blonde
 Leapt out to clasp her in his arms
 And as hed never learnt to swim
 Poor fool that was the end of him

 A rustic glimpsed amid the trees
 The bluff moon caught as in a snare
 They say it do be made of cheese
 Said Giles and that a chap bides there   
 That Blue Boar ale be strong I vow
 The lads awinkin at me now

 Two lovers watched the new moon hold
 The old moon in her bright embrace
 Said she Theres mother pale and old
 And drawing near her resting place
 Said he Be mine and with me wed
 Moonhigh she stared    she shook her head

 A soldier saw with dying eyes
 The bleared moon like a ball of blood
 And thought of how in other skies
 So pearly bright on leaf and bud
 Like peace its soft white beams had lain
 _Like Peace_    He closed his eyes again

 Child lover poet soldier clown
 Ah yes old Moon what things youve seen
 I marvel now as you look down
 How can your face be so serene
 And tranquil still youll make your round
 Old Moon when we are underground



And now blow out your candle lad and get to bed See the dawn is in
the sky Open your window and let its freshness rouge your cheek
Youve earned your rest Sleep

Aye but before I do so let me read again the last of my _Ballads_




The SewingGirl



 The humble garret where I dwell
 Is in that Quarter called the Latin
 It isnt spacioustruth to tell
 Theres hardly room to swing a cat in
 But what of that Its there I fight
 For food and fame my Muse inviting
 And all the day and half the night
 Youll find me writing writing writing

 Now it was in the month of May
 As wrestling with a rhyme rheumatic
 I chanced to look across the way
 And lo within a neighbor attic
 A hand drew back the window shade
 And there a picture glad and glowing
 I saw a sweet and slender maid
 And she was sewing sewing sewing

 So poor the room so small so scant
 Yet somehow oh so bright and airy
 There was a pink geranium plant
 Likewise a very pert canary
 And in the maidens heart it seemed
 Some fount of gladness must be springing
 For as alone I sadly dreamed
 I heard her singing singing singing

 God love her how it cheered me then
 To see her there so brave and pretty
 So she with needle I with pen
 We slaved and sang above the city
 And as across my streams of ink
 I watched her from a poets distance
 She stitched and sang    I scarcely think
 She was aware of my existence

 And then one day she sang no more
 That put me out theres no denying
 I lookedshe labored as before
 But bless me she was crying crying
 Her poor canary chirped in vain
 Her pink geranium drooped in sorrow
 Of course said I shell sing again
 Maybe I sighed she will tomorrow

 Poor child twas finished with her song
 Day after day her tears were flowing
 And as I wondered what was wrong
 She pined and peaked above her sewing
 And then one day the blind she drew
 Ah though I sought with vain endeavor
 To pierce the darkness well I knew
 My sewinggirl had gone for ever

 And as I sit alone tonight
 My eyes unto her room are turning   
 Id give the sum of all I write
 Once more to see her candle burning
 Once more to glimpse her happy face
 And while my rhymes of cheer Im ringing
 Across the sunny sweep of space
 To hear her singing singing singing



Heigh ho I realize I am very weary Its nice to be so tired and to
know one can sleep as long as one wants The morning sunlight floods in
at my window so I draw the blind and throw myself on my bed

My Garret

Montparnasse April

Hurrah As I opened my eyes this morning to a hard unfeeling world
little did I think what a surprise awaited me A big blue envelope had
been pushed under my door Another rejection I thought and I took it
up distastefully The next moment I was staring at my first cheque

It was an express order for two hundred francs in payment of a bit of
verse   So today I will celebrate I will lunch at the
DHarcourt I will dine on the Grand Boulevard I will go to the
theater

Well heres the thing that has turned the tide for me It is somewhat
in the vein of Sourdough Service the Yukon bard I dont think much
of his stuff but they say he makes heaps of money I can well believe
it for he drives a HispanoSuiza in the Bois every afternoon The
other night he was with a crowd at the Dome Cafe a chubby chap who sits
in a corner and seldom speaks I was disappointed I thought he was a
big hairy man who swore like a trooper and mixed brandy with his beer
He only drank Vichy poor fellow




Lucille



 Of course youve heard of the _Nancy Lee_ and how she sailed away
 On her famous quest of the Arctic flea to the wilds of Hudsons Bay
 For it was a foreign Princes whim to collect this tiny cuss
 And a golden quid was no more to him than a copper to coves like us
 So we sailed away and our hearts were gay as we gazed on the gorgeous scene
 And we laughed with glee as we caught the flea of the wolf and the wolverine
 Yea our hearts were light as the parasite of the ermine rat we slew
 And the great musk ox and the silver fox and the moose and the caribou
 And we laughed with zest as the insect pest of the marmot crowned our zeal
 And the wary mink and the wily link and the walrus and the seal
 And with eyes aglow on the scornful snow we danced a rigadoon
 Round the lonesome lair of the Arctic hare by the light of the silver moon

 But the time was nigh to homeward hie when imagine our despair
 For the best of the lot we hadnt gotthe flea of the polar bear
 Oh his face was long and his breath was strong as the Skipper he says to me
 I wants you to linger ere my lad by the shores of the Hartic Sea
 I wants you to unt the polar bear the perishin winter through
 And if flea ye find of its breed and kind theres a undred quid for you
 But I shook my head No Cap I said its yourself Id like to please
 But I tells ye flat I wouldnt do that if ye went on yer bended knees
 Then the Captain spat in the seething brine and he says Good luck to you
 If it cant be did for a undred quid supposin we call it two
 So that was why they said goodby and they sailed and left me there
 Alone alone in the Arctic Zone to hunt for the polar bear

 Oh the days were slow and packed with woe
 till I thought they would never end
 And I used to sit when the fire was lit with my pipe for my only friend
 And I tried to sing some rollicky thing but my song broke off in a prayer
 And Id drowse and dream by the driftwood gleam Id dream of a polar bear
 Id dream of a cloudlike polar bear that blotted the stars on high
 With ravenous jaws and flenzing claws and the flames of hell in his eye
 And Id trap around on the frozen ground as a proper hunter ought
 And beasts Id find of every kind but never the one I sought
 Never a track in the white icepack that humped and heaved and flawed
 Till I came to think Why strike me pink if the creature aint a fraud
 And then one night in the waning light as I hurried home to sup
 I hears a roar by the cabin door and a great white hulk heaves up
 So my rifle flashed and a bullet crashed dead dead as a stone fell he
 And I gave a cheer for there in his earGosh ding mea tiny flea

 At last at last Oh I clutched it fast and I gazed on it with pride
 And I thrust it into a biscuittin and I shut it safe inside
 With a lid of glass for the light to pass and space to leap and play
 Oh it kept alive yea seemed to thrive as I watched it night and day
 And I used to sit and sing to it and I shielded it from harm
 And many a hearty feed it had on the heft of my hairy arm
 For youll never know in that land of snow how lonesome a man can feel
 So I made a fuss of the little cuss and I christened it Lucille
 But the longest winter has its end and the ice went out to sea
 And I saw one day a ship in the bay and there was the _Nancy Lee_
 So a boat was lowered and I went aboard and they opened wide their eyes
 Yes they gave a cheer when the truth was clear
 and they saw my precious prize
 And then it was all like a giddy dream but to cut my story short
 We sailed away on the fifth of May to the foreign Princes court
 To a palmy land and a palace grand and the little Prince was there
 And a fat Princess in a satin dress with a crown of gold on her hair
 And they showed me into a shiny room just him and her and me
 And the Prince he was pleased and friendlylike
 and he calls for drinks for three
 And I shows them my battered biscuittin and I makes my modest spiel
 And they laughed they did when I opened the lid
 and out there popped Lucille

 Oh the Prince was glad I could soon see that and the Princess she was too
 And Lucille waltzed round on the tablecloth as she often used to do
 And the Prince pulled out a purse of gold and he put it in my hand
 And he says It was worth all that Im told to stay in that nasty land
 And then he turned with a sudden cry and he clutched at his royal beard
 And the Princess screamed and well she mightfor Lucille had disappeared

 She must be here said his Noble Nibbs so we hunted all around
 Oh we searched that place but never a trace of the little beast we found
 So I shook my head and I glumly said Gol darn the saucy cuss
 Its mighty queer but she isnt here so    she must be on one of us
 Youll pardon me if I make so free buttheres just one thing to do
 If youll kindly go for a half a mo Ill search me garments through
 Then all alone on the shiny throne I stripped from head to heel
 In vain in vain it was very plain that I hadnt got Lucille
 So I garbed again and I told the Prince and he scratched his august head
 I suppose if she hasnt selected you it must be me he said
 So _he_ retired but he soon came back and his features showed distress
 Oh it isnt you and it isnt me    Then we looked at the Princess
 So _she_ retired and we heard a scream and she opened wide the door
 And her fingers twain were pinched to pain but a radiant smile she wore
 Its here she cries our precious prize
 Oh I found it right away   
 Then I ran to her with a shout of joy but I choked with a wild dismay
 I clutched the back of the golden throne and the room began to reel   
 What she held to me was ah yes a flea but    _it wasnt my Lucille_



After all I did not celebrate I sat on the terrace of the Cafe
Napolitain on the Grand Boulevard half hypnotized by the passing crowd
And as I sat I fell into conversation with a godlike stranger who
sipped some golden ambrosia He told me he was an actor and introduced
me to his beverage which he called a SuzeAnni He soon left me but
the effect of the golden liquid remained and there came over me a
desire to write _Cetait plus fort que moi_ So instead of going to
the Folies Bergere I spent all evening in the Omnium Bar near the
Bourse and wrote the following




On the Boulevard



 Oh its pleasant sitting here
 Seeing all the people pass
 You beside your _bock_ of beer
 I behind my _demitasse_
 Chatting of no matter what
 You the Mummer I the Bard
 Oh its jolly is it not
 Sitting on the Boulevard

 More amusing than a book
 If a chap has eyes to see
 For no matter where I look
 Stories stories jump at me
 Moving tales my pen might write
 Poems plain on every face
 Monologues you could recite
 With inimitable grace

 Ah Imaginations power
 See yon _demimondaine_ there
 Idly toying with a flower
 Smiling with a pensive air   
 Well her smile is but a mask
 For I saw within her muff
 Such a wicked little flask
 Vitriolugh the beastly stuff

 Now look back beside the bar
 See yon curled and scented _beau_
 Puffing at a fine cigar
 _Sale espece de maquereau_
 Well of course its all surmise
 Its for him she holds her place
 When he passes she will rise
 Dash the vitriol in his face

 Quick theyll carry him away
 Pack him in a Red Cross car
 Her theyll hurry so they say
 To the cells of St Lazare
 What will happen then you ask
 What will all the sequel be
 Ah Imaginations task
 Isnt easy    let me see   

 She will go to jail no doubt
 For a year or maybe two
 Then as soon as she gets out
 Start her bawdy life anew
 He will lie within a ward
 Harmless as a man can be
 With his face grotesquely scarred
 And his eyes that cannot see

 Then amid the citys din
 He will stand against a wall
 With around his neck a tin
 Into which the pennies fall
 She will pass I see it plain
 Like a cinematograph
 She will halt and turn again
 Look and look and maybe laugh

 Well Im not so sure of that
 Whether she will laugh or cry
 He will hold a battered hat
 To the lady passing by
 He will smile a cringing smile
 And into his grimy hold
 With a laugh or sob the while
 She will drop a piece of gold

 Bless you lady he will say
 And get grandly drunk that night
 She will come and come each day
 Fascinated by the sight
 Then somehow hell get to know
 Maybe by some kindly friend
 Who she is and so    and so
 Bring my story to an end

 How his heart will burst with hate
 He will curse and he will cry
 He will wait and wait and wait
 Till again she passes by
 Then like tiger from its lair
 He will leap from out his place
 Down her clutch her by the hair
 Smear the vitriol on her face

 Ah Imagination rare
 See    he takes his hat to go
 Now hes level with her chair
 Now she rises up to throw   
 _God and she has done it too_   
 Oh those screams those hideous screams
 I imagined and    its true
 How his face will haunt my dreams

 What a sight It makes me sick
 Seems I am to blame somehow
 _Garcon_ fetch a brandy quick   
 There Im feeling better now
 Lets collaborate we two
 You the Mummer I the Bard
 Oh what ripping stuff well do
 Sitting on the Boulevard



It is strange how one works easily at times I wrote this so quickly
that I might almost say I had reached the end before I had come to the
beginning In such a mood I wonder why everybody does not write poetry
Get a Rogets _Thesaurus_ a rhyming dictionary sit before your
typewriter with a strong glass of coffee at your elbow and just click
the stuff off




Facility



 So easy tis to make a rhyme
 That did the world but know it
 Your coachman might Parnassus climb
 Your butler be a poet

 Then oh how charming it would be
 If when in haste hysteric
 You called the page you learned that he
 Was grappling with a lyric

 Or else what rapture it would yield
 When cook sent up the salad
 To find within its depths concealed
 A touching little ballad

 Or if for tea and toast you yearned
 What joy to find upon it
 The chambermaid had coyly laid
 A palpitating sonnet

 Your baker could the fashion set
 Your butcher might respond well
 With every tart a triolet
 With every chop a rondel

 Your tailors bill    well Ill be blowed
 Dear chap I never knowed him   
 Hes gone and written me an ode
 Instead of what I _owed_ him

 So easy tis to rhyme    yet stay
 Oh terrible misgiving
 Please do not give the game away   
 Ive got to make my living

My Garret

May 1914




Golden Days



 Another day of toil and strife
 Another page so white
 Within that fateful Log of Life
 That I and all must write
 Another page without a stain
 To make of as I may
 That done I shall not see again
 Until the Judgment Day

 Ah could I could I backward turn
 The pages of that Book
 How often would I blench and burn
 How often loathe to look
 What pages would be meanly scrolled
 What smeared as if with mud
 A few maybe might gleam like gold
 Some scarlet seem as blood

 O Record grave God guide my hand
 And make me worthy be
 Since what I write today shall stand
 To all eternity
 Aye teach me Lord of Life I pray
 As I salute the sun
 To bear myself that every day
 May be a Golden One



I awoke this morning to see the bright sunshine flooding my garret No
chamber in the palace of a king could have been more fair How I sang as
I dressed How I lingered over my coffee savoring every drop How
carefully I packed my pipe gazing serenely over the roofs of Paris

Never is the city so lovely as in this month of May when all the trees
are in the fullness of their foliage As I look I feel a freshness of
vision in my eyes Wonder wakes in me The simplest things move me to
delight




The Joy of Little Things



 Its good the great green earth to roam
 Where sights of awe the soul inspire
 But oh its best the coming home
 The crackle of ones own hearthfire
 Youve hobnobbed with the solemn Past
 Youve seen the pageantry of kings
 Yet oh how sweet to gain at last
 The peace and rest of Little Things

 Perhaps youre counted with the Great
 You strain and strive with mighty men
 Your hand is on the helm of State
 Colossuslike you stride    and then
 There comes a pause a shining hour
 A dog that leaps a hand that clings
 O Titan turn from pomp and power
 Give all your heart to Little Things

 Go couch you childwise in the grass
 Believing its some jungle strange
 Where mighty monsters peer and pass
 Where beetles roam and spiders range
 Mid gloom and gleam of leaf and blade
 What dragons rasp their painted wings
 O magic world of shine and shade
 O beauty land of Little Things

 I sometimes wonder after all
 Amid this tangled web of fate
 If what is great may not be small
 And what is small may not be great
 So wondering I go my way
 Yet in my heart contentment sings   
 O may I ever see I pray
 Gods grace and love in Little Things

 So give to me I only beg
 A little roof to call my own
 A little cider in the keg
 A little meat upon the bone
 A little garden by the sea
 A little boat that dips and swings   
 Take wealth take fame but leave to me
 O Lord of Life just Little Things



Yesterday I finished my tenth ballad When I have done about a score I
will seek a publisher If I cannot find one I will earn beg or steal
the money to get them printed Then if they do not sell I will hawk
them from door to door Oh Ill succeed I know Ill succeed And yet
I dont want an easy success give me the joy of the fight the thrill
of the adventure Heres my last ballad




The Absinthe Drinkers



 Hes yonder on the terrace of the Cafe de la Paix
 The little wizened Spanish man I see him every day
 Hes sitting with his Pernod on his customary chair
 Hes staring at the passers with his customary stare
 He never takes his piercing eyes from off that moving throng
 That current cosmopolitan meandering along
 Dark diplomats from Martinique pale Rastas from Peru
 An Englishman from Bloomsbury a Yank from Kalamazoo
 A poet from Montmartres heights a dapper little Jap
 Exotic citizens of all the countries on the map
 A tourist horde from every land thats underneath the sun
 That little wizened Spanish man he misses never one
 Oh foul or fair hes always there and many a drink he buys
 And theres a fire of red desire within his hollow eyes
 And sipping of my Pernod and aknowing what I know
 Sometimes I want to shriek aloud and give away the show
 Ive lost my nerve hes haunting me hes like a beast of prey
 That Spanish man thats watching at the Cafe de la Paix

 Say Listen and Ill tell you all    the day was growing dim
 And I was with my Pernod at the table next to him
 And he was sitting soberly as if he were asleep
 When suddenly he seemed to tense like tiger for a leap
 And then he swung around to me his hand went to his hip
 My heart was beating like a gongmy arm was in his grip
 His eyes were glaring into mine aye though I shrank with fear
 His fetid breath was on my face his voice was in my ear
 Excuse my _brusquerie_ he hissed but sir do you suppose
 That portly man who passed us had a _wen upon his nose_

 And then at last it dawned on me the fellow must be mad
 And when I soothingly replied I do not think he had
 The little wizened Spanish man subsided in his chair
 And shrouded in his raven cloak resumed his owlish stare
 But when I tried to slip away he turned and glared at me
 And oh that fishlike face of his was sinister to see
 Forgive me if I startled you of course you think Im queer
 No doubt you wonder who I am so solitary here
 You question why the passersby I piercingly review   
 Well listen my bibacious friend Ill tell my tale to you

 It happened twenty years ago and in another land
 A maiden young and beautiful two suitors for her hand
 My rival was the lucky one I vowed I would repay
 Revenge has mellowed in my heart its rotten ripe today
 My happy rival skipped away vamoosed he left no trace
 And so Im waiting waiting here to meet him face to face
 For has it not been ever said that all the world one day
 Will pass in pilgrimage before the Cafe de la Paix

 But sir I made remonstrance if its twenty years ago
 Youd scarcely recognize him now he must have altered so
 The little wizened Spanish man he laughed a hideous laugh
 And from his cloak he quickly drew a faded photograph
 Youre right said he but there are traits oh this you must allow
 That never change Lopez was fat he must be fatter now
 His paunch is senatorial he cannot see his toes
 Im sure of it and then behold that wen upon his nose
 Im looking for a man like that Ill wait and wait until   
 What will you do I sharply cried he answered me Why kill
 He robbed me of my happinessnay stranger do not start
 Ill firmly and politely puta bullet in his heart

 And then that little Spanish man with big cigar alight
 Uprose and shook my trembling hand and vanished in the night
 And I went home and thought of him and had a dreadful dream
 Of portly men with each a wen and woke up with a scream
 And sure enough next morning as I prowled the Boulevard
 A portly man with wenny nose roamed into my regard
 Then like a flash I ran to him and clutched him by the arm
 Oh sir said I I do not wish to see you come to harm
 But if your life you value aught I beg entreat and pray
 Dont pass before the terrace of the Cafe de la Paix
 That portly man he looked at me with such a startled air
 Then bolted like a rabbit down the rue Michaudiere
 Ha ha Ive saved a life I thought and laughed in my relief
 And straightway joined the Spanish man oer his _aperitif_
 And thus each day I dodged about and kept the strictest guard
 For portly men with each a wen upon the Boulevard
 And then I hailed my Spanish pal and sitting in the sun
 We ordered many Pernods and we drank them every one
 And sternly he would stare and stare until my hand would shake
 And grimly he would glare and glare until my heart would quake
 And I would say Alphonso lad I must expostulate
 Why keep alive for twenty years the furnace of your hate
 Perhaps his wedded life was hell and you at least are free   
 Thats where youve got it wrong he snarled the fool she took was _me_
 My rival sneaked threw up the sponge betrayed himself a churl
 Twas he who got the happiness I only gotthe girl
 With that he looked so devillike he made me creep and shrink
 And there was nothing else to do but buy another drink

 Now yonder like a blot of ink he sits across the way
 Upon the smiling terrace of the Cafe de la Paix
 That little wizened Spanish man his face is ghastly white
 His eyes are staring staring like a tigers in the night
 I know within his evil heart the fires of hate are fanned
 I know his automatics ready waiting to his hand
 I know a tragedy is near I dread I have no peace   
 Oh dont you think I ought to go and call upon the police
 Look there    hes rising up    my God
 He leaps from out his place   
 Yon millionaire from Argentine    the two are face to face   
 A shot A shriek A heavy fall A huddled heap Oh see
 The little wizened Spanish man is dancing in his glee   
 Im sick    Im faint    Im going mad   
 Oh please take me away   
 Theres BLOOD upon the terrace of the Cafe de la Paix   



And now Ill leave my work and sally forth The city is _en fete_ Ill
join the crowd and laugh and sing with the best



 The sunshine seeks my little room
 To tell me Paris streets are gay
 That children cry the lily bloom
 All up and down the leafy way
 That half the town is mad with May
 With flame of flag and boom of bell
 For Carnival is King today
 So pen and page awhile farewell

The Release



 Today within a grogshop near
 I saw a newly captured linnet
 Who beat against his cage in fear
 And fell exhausted every minute
 And when I asked the fellow there
 If he to sell the bird were willing
 He told me with a careless air
 That I could have it for a shilling

 And so I bought it cage and all
 Although I went without my dinner
 And where some trees were fairly tall
 And houses shrank and smoke was thinner
 The tiny door I open threw
 As down upon the grass I sank me
 Poor little chap How quick he flew   
 He didnt even wait to thank me

 Lifes like a cage we beat the bars
 We bruise our breasts we struggle vainly
 Up to the glory of the stars
 We strain with flutterings ungainly
 And thenGod opens wide the door
 Our wondrous wings are arched for flying
 We poise we part we sing we soar   
 Light freedom love    Fools call itDying



Yes that wretched little bird haunted me I had to let it go Since I
have seized my own liberty I am a fanatic for freedom It is now a year
ago I launched on my great adventure I have had hard times been
hungry cold weary I have worked harder than ever I did and
discouragement has slapped me on the face Yet the year has been the
happiest of my life

And all because I am free By reason of filthy money no one can say to
me Do this or do that Master doesnt exist in my vocabulary I can
look any man in the face and tell him to go to the devil I belong to
myself I am not for sale Its glorious to feel like that It
sweetens the dry crust and warms the heart in the icy wind For that I
will hunger and go threadbare for that I will live austerely and deny
myself all pleasure After health the best thing in life is freedom

Here is the last of my ballads It is by way of being an experiment
Its theme is commonplace its language that of everyday It is a bit of
realism in rhyme




The Wee Shop



 She risked her all they told me bravely sinking
 The pinched economies of thirty years
 And there the little shop was meek and shrinking
 The sum of all her dreams and hopes and fears
 Ere it was opened I would see them in it
 The grayhaired dame the daughter with her crutch
 So fond so happy hoarding every minute
 Like artists for the final tender touch

 The opening day Im sure that to their seeming
 Was never shop so wonderful as theirs
 With pyramids of jamjars rubbed to gleaming
 Such vivid cans of peaches prunes and pears
 And chocolate and biscuits in glass cases
 And bonbon bottles manyhued and bright
 Yet nothing half so radiant as their faces
 Their eyes of hope excitement and delight

 I entered how they waited all aflutter
 How awkwardly they weighed my aciddrops
 And then with all the thanks a tongue could utter
 They bowed me from the kindliest of shops
 Im sure that night their customers they numbered
 Discussed them all in happy breathless speech
 And though quite worn and weary ere they slumbered
 Sent heavenward a little prayer for each

 And so I watched with interest redoubled
 That little shop spent in it all I had
 And when I saw it empty I was troubled
 And when I saw them busy I was glad
 And when I dared to ask how things were going
 They told me with a fine and gallant smile
 Not badly    slow at first    Theres never knowing   
 Twill surely pick up in a little while

 Id often see them through the winter weather
 Behind the shutters by a lights faint speck
 Poring oer books their faces close together
 The lame girls arm around her mothers neck
 They dressed their windows not one time but twenty
 Each change more pinched more desperately neat
 Alas I wondered if behind that plenty
 The two who owned it had enough to eat

 Ah who would dare to sing of tea and coffee
 The sadness of a stock unsold and dead
 The petty tragedy of melting toffee
 The sordid pathos of stale gingerbread
 Ignoble themes And yetthose haggard faces
 Within that little shop    Oh here I say
 One does not need to look in lofty places
 For tragic themes theyre round us every day

 And so I saw their agony their fighting
 Their eyes of fear their heartbreak their despair
 And there the little shop is black and blighting
 And all the world goes by and does not care
 They say she sought her old employers pity
 Content to take the pittance he would give
 The lame girl yes shes working in the city
 She coughs a lotshe hasnt long to live



Last night MacBean introduced me to Saxon Dane the Poet Truly he is
more like a blacksmith than a Barda big bearded man whose black eyes
brood somberly or flash with sudden fire We talked of Walt Whitman and
then of others

The trouble with poetry he said is that it is too exalted It has a
phraseology of its own it selects themes that are quite outside of
ordinary experience As a medium of expression it fails to reach the
great mass of the people

Then he added To hell with the great mass of the people What have
they got to do with it Write to please yourself as if not a single
reader existed The moment a man begins to be conscious of an audience
he is artistically damned Youre not a Poet I hope

I meekly assured him I was a mere maker of verse

Well said he better good verse than middling poetry And maybe even
the humblest of rhymes has its uses Happiness is happiness whether it
be inspired by a Rossetti sonnet or a ballad by G R Sims Let each one
who has something to say say it in the best way he can and abide the
result    After all he went on what does it matter We are
living in a pygmy day With Tennyson and Browning the line of great
poets passed away perhaps for ever The world today is full of little
minstrels who echo one another and who pipe away tunefully enough But
with one exception they do not matter

I dared to ask who was his one exception He answered Myself of
course

Heres a bit of light verse which it amused me to write today as I sat
in the sun on the terrace of the Closerie de Lilas




The Philistine and the Bohemian



 She was a Philistine spick and span
 He was a bold Bohemian
 She had the _mode_ and the last at that
 He had a cape and a brigand hat
 She was so _riant_ and _chic_ and trim
 He was so shaggy unkempt and grim
 On the rue de la Paix she was wont to shine
 The rue de la Gaite was more his line
 She doted on Barclay and Dell and Caine
 He quoted Mallarme and Paul Verlaine
 She was a triumph at Tango teas
 At Vorticists suppers he sought to please
 She thought that Franz Lehar was utterly great
 Of Strauss and Stravinsky hed piously prate
 She loved elegance he loved art
 They were as wide as the poles apart
 YetCupid and Caprice are hand and glove
 They met at a dinner they fell in love

 Home he went to his garret bare
 Thrilling with rapture hope despair
 Swift he gazed in his lookingglass
 Made a grimace and murmured Ass
 Seized his scissors and fiercely sheared
 Severed his buccaneering beard
 Grabbed his hair and clip clip clip
 Off came a bunch with every snip
 Ran to a tailors in startled state
 Suits a dozen commanded straight
 Coats and overcoats pants in pairs
 Everything that a dandy wears
 Socks and collars and shoes and ties
 Everything that a dandy buys
 Chums looked at him with wondering stare
 Fancied theyd seen him before somewhere
 A Brummell a DOrsay a _beau_ so fine
 A shining immaculate Philistine

 Home she went in a raptured daze
 Looked in a mirror with startled gaze
 Didnt seem to be pleased at all
 Savagely muttered Insipid Doll
 Clutched her hair and a pair of shears
 Cropped and bobbed it behind the ears
 Aimed at a wan and willowynecked
 Sort of a Holman Hunt effect
 Robed in subtile and sagegreen tones
 Like the dames of Rossetti and E BurneJones
 Girdled her garments billowing wide
 Moved with an undulating glide
 All her frivolous friends forsook
 Cultivated a soulful look
 Gushed in a voice with a creamy throb
 Over some weirdly Futurist daub
 Did all in short that a woman can
 To be a consummate Bohemian

 A year went past with its hopes and fears
 A year that seemed like a dozen years
 They met once more    Oh at last At last
 They rushed together they stopped aghast
 They looked at each other with blank dismay
 They simply hadnt a word to say
 He thought with a shiver Can this be she
 She thought with a shudder This cant be he
 This simpering dandy so sleek and spruce
 This languorous lily in garments loose
 They sought to brace from the awful shock
 Taking a seat they tried to talk
 She spoke of Bergson and Paters prose
 He prattled of dances and ragtime shows
 She purred of pictures Matisse Cezanne
 His tastes to the girls of Kirchner ran
 She raved of Tchaikovsky and Caesar Franck
 He owned that he was a jazzband crank
 They made no headway Alas alas
 He thought her a bore she thought him an ass
 And so they arose and hurriedly fled
 Perish Illusion Romance youre dead
 He loved elegance she loved art
 Better at once to part to part

 And what is the moral of all this rot
 Dont try to be what you know youre not
 And if youre made on a muttonish plan
 Dont seek to seem a Bohemian
 And if to the goats your feet incline
 Dont try to pass for a Philistine

A Small Cafe in a Side Street

The Bohemian Dreams



 Because my overcoats in pawn
 I choose to take my glass
 Within a little _bistro_ on
 The rue du Montparnasse
 The dusty bins with bottles shine
 The counters lined with zinc
 And there I sit and drink my wine
 And think and think and think

 I think of hoary old Stamboul
 Of Moslem and of Greek
 Of Persian in coat of wool
 Of Kurd and Arab sheikh
 Of all the types of weal and woe
 And as I raise my glass
 Across Galata bridge I know
 They pass and pass and pass

 I think of citrontrees aglow
 Of fanpalms shading down
 Of sailors dancing heel and toe
 With wenches black and brown
 And though its all an ocean far
 From Yucatan to France
 Ill bet beside the old bazaar
 They dance and dance and dance

 I think of Monte Carlo where
 The pallid croupiers call
 And in the gorgeous guilty air
 The gamblers watch the ball
 And as I flick away the foam
 With which my beer is crowned
 The wheels beneath the gilded dome
 Go round and round and round

 I think of vast Niagara
 Those gulfs of foam ashine
 Whose mighty roar would stagger a
 More prosy bean than mine
 And as the hours I idly spend
 Against a greasy wall
 I know that green the waters bend
 And fall and fall and fall

 I think of Nijni Novgorod
 And Jews who never rest
 And womenfolk with spade and hod
 Who slave in BudaPest
 Of squat and sturdy Japanese
 Who pound the paddy soil
 And as I loaf and smoke at ease
 They toil and toil and toil

 I think of shrines in Hindustan
 Of cloistral glooms in Spain
 Of minarets in Ispahan
 Of St Sophias fane
 Of convent towers in Palestine
 Of temples in Cathay
 And as I stretch and sip my wine
 They pray and pray and pray

 And so my dreams I dwell within
 And visions come and go
 And life is passing like a Cin
 Ematographic Show
 Till just as surely as my pipe
 Is underneath my nose
 Amid my visions rich and ripe
 I doze and doze and doze



Alas it is too true Once more I am counting the coppers living on
the ragged edge My manuscripts come back to me like boomerangs and I
have not the postage far less the heart to send them out again

MacBean seems to take an interest in my struggles I often sit in his
room in the rue SaintJulienlePauvre smoking and sipping whisky into
the small hours He is an old hand who knows the market and frankly
manufactures for it

Give me short pieces he says things of three verses that will fill
a blank halfpage of a magazine Let them be sprightly and if
possible have a snapper at the end Give me that sort of article I
think I can place it for you

Then he looked through a lot of my verse This is the kind of stuff I
might be able to sell he said




A Domestic Tragedy



 Clorinda met me on the way
 As I came from the train
 Her face was anything but gay
 In fact suggested pain
 Oh hubby hubby dear she cried
 Ive awful news to tell   
 What is it darling I replied
 Your motheris she well

 Oh no oh no it is not that
 Its something else she wailed
 My heart was beating pitapat
 My ruddy visage paled
 Like lightning flash in heavens dome
 The fear within me woke
 Dont say I cried our little home
 Has all gone up in smoke

 She shook her head Oh swift I clasped
 And held her to my breast
 The children Tell me quick I gasped
 Believe me it is best
 Then then she spoke mid sobs I caught
 These words of woe divine
 Its coocoocook has gone and bought
 _A new hat just like mine_



At present I am living on bread and milk By doing this I can rub along
for another ten days The thought pleases me As long as I have a
crust I am master of my destiny Some day when I am rich and famous I
shall look back on all this with regret Yet I think I shall always
remain a Bohemian I hate regularity The clock was never made for me
I want to eat when I am hungry sleep when I am weary drinkwell
any old time

I prefer to be alone Company is a constraint on my spirit I never
make an engagement if I can avoid it To do so is to put a mortgage on
my future I like to be able to rise in the morning with the thought
that the hours before me are all mine to spend in my own wayto work
to dream to watch the unfolding drama of life

Here is another of my ballads It is longer than most and gave me more
trouble though none the better for that




The Pencil Seller



 A pencil sir a pennywont you buy
 Im cold and wet and tired a sorry plight
 Dont turn your back sir take one just to try
 I havent made a single sale tonight
 Oh thank you sir but take the pencil too
 Im not a beggar Im a business man
 Pencils I deal in red and black and blue
 Its hard but still I do the best I can
 Most days I make enough to pay for bread
 A cup o coffee stretching room at night
 One needs so littleto be warm and fed
 A hole to kennel inoh ones all right   

 Excuse me youre a painter are you not
 I saw you looking at that dealers show
 The _croutes_ he has for sale a shabby lot
 What do I know of Art What do I know   
 Well look That David Strong so well displayed
 White Sorcery its called all gossamer
 And pale moonmagic and a dancing maid
 You like the little elfin face of her
 Thats good but still the picture as a whole
 The valuesPah He never painted worse
 Perhaps because his fire was lacking coal
 His cupboard bare no money in his purse
 Perhaps    they say he labored hard and long
 And see now in the harvest of his fame
 When round his pictures people gape and throng
 A scurvy dealer sells this on his name
 A wretched rag wrung out of want and woe
 A soulless daub not David Strong a bit
 Unworthy of his art    How should I know
 How should I know Im _Strong_I painted it

 There now I didnt mean to let that out
 It came in spite of meaye stare and stare
 You think Im lying crazy drunk no doubt
 Think what you like its neither here nor there
 Its hard to tell so terrible a truth
 To gain to glory yet be such as I
 Its true that pictures mine done in my youth
 Up in a garret near the Paris sky
 The childs my daughter aye she posed for me
 Thats why I come and sit here every night
 The paintings bad but stilloh still I see
 Her little face all laughing in the light
 So now you understandI live in fear
 Lest one like you should carry it away
 A poor potboiling thing but oh how dear
 Dont let them buy it pitying God I pray
 And hark ye sirsometimes my brains awhirl
 Some night Ill crash into that window pane
 And snatch my picture back my little girl
 And run and run   
 Im talking wild again
 A crab cant run Im crippled withered lame
 Palsied as good as dead all down one side
 No warning had I when the evil came
 It struck me down in all my strength and pride
 Triumph was mine I thrilled with perfect power
 Honor was mine Fames laurel touched my brow
 Glory was minewithin a little hour
 I was a god and    what you find me now

 My child that little laughing girl you see
 She was my nurse for all ten weary years
 Her joy her hope her youth she gave for me
 Her very smiles were masks to hide her tears
 And I my precious art so rich so rare
 Lost lost to mewhat could my heart but break
 Oh as I lay and wrestled with despair
 I would have killed myself but for her sake   

 By luck I had some pictures I could sell
 And so we fought the wolf back from the door
 She painted too aye wonderfully well
 We often dreamed of brighter days in store
 And then quite suddenly she seemed to fail
 I saw the shadows darken round her eyes
 So tired she was so sorrowful so pale
 And oh there came a day she could not rise
 The doctor looked at her he shook his head
 And spoke of wine and grapes and Southern air
 If you can get her out of this he said
 Shell have a fighting chance with proper care

 With proper care When he had gone away
 I sat there trembling twitching dazed with grief
 Under my old and ragged coat she lay
 Our room was bare and cold beyond belief
 Maybe I thought I still can paint a bit
 Some lilies landscape anything at all
 Alas My brush I could not steady it
 Down from my fumbling hand I let it fall
 With proper carehow could I give her that
 Half of me dead    I crawled down to the street
 Cowering beside the wall I held my hat
 And begged of every one I chanced to meet
 I got some pennies bought her milk and bread
 And so I fought to keep the Doom away
 And yet I saw with agony of dread
 My dear one sinking sinking day by day
 And then I was awakened in the night
 Please take my hands Im cold I heard her sigh
 And soft she whispered as she held me tight
 Oh daddy weve been happy you and I
 I do not think she suffered any pain
 She breathed so quietly    but though I tried
 I could not warm her little hands again
 And so there in the icy dark she died   
 The dawn came groping in with fingers gray
 And touched me sitting silent as a stone
 I kissed those piteous lips as cold as clay
 I did not cry I did not even moan
 At last I rose groped down the narrow stair
 An evil fog was oozing from the sky
 Halfcrazed I stumbled on I knew not where
 Like phantoms were the folks that passed me by
 How long I wandered thus I do not know
 But suddenly I halted stood stockstill
 Beside a door that spilled a golden glow
 I saw a name _my name_ upon a bill
 A Sale of Famous Pictures so it read
 A Notable Collection each a gem
 Distinguished Works of Art by painters dead
 The folks were going in I followed them
 I stood upon the outskirts of the crowd
 I only hoped that none might notice me
 Soon soon I heard them call my name aloud
 A David Strong his _Fete in Brittany_
 A brave big picture that the best Ive done
 It glowed and kindled half the hall away
 With all its memories of sea and sun
 Of pipe and bowl of joyous work and play
 I saw the sardine nets blue as the sky
 I saw the nutbrown fisherboats put out
 Five hundred pounds rapped out a voice near by
 Six hundred Seven Eight And then a shout
 A thousand pounds Oh how I thrilled to hear
 Oh how the bids went up by leaps by bounds
 And then a silence then the auctioneer
 Its going Going Gone _Three thousand pounds_
 Three thousand pounds A frenzy leapt in me
 That pictures mine I cried Im David Strong
 I painted it this famished wretch you see
 I did it I and sold it for a song
 And in a garret three small hours ago
 My daughter died for want of Christian care
 Look look at me    Is it to mock my woe
 You pay three thousand for my picture there   

 O God I stumbled blindly from the hall
 The city crashed on me the fiendish sounds
 Of cruelty and strife but over all
 Three thousand pounds I heard Three thousand pounds

 There thats my story sir it isnt gay
 Tales of the Poor are never very bright   
 Youll look for me next time you pass this way   
 I hope youll find me sir goodnight goodnight

The Luxembourg

June 1914

On a late afternoon when the sunlight is mellow on the leaves I often
sit near the Fontaine de Medicis and watch the children at their play
Sometimes I make bits of verse about them such as




FiFi in Bed



 Up into the sky I stare
 All the little stars I see
 And I know that God is there
 O how lonely He must be

 Me I laugh and leap all day
 Till my head begins to nod
 Hes so great He cannot play
 I am glad I am not God

 Poor kind God upon His throne
 Up there in the sky so blue
 Always always all alone   
 _Please dear God I pity You_



Or else sitting on the terrace of a cafe on the Boul Mich I sip
slowly a Dubonnet or a Byrrh and the charm of the Quarter possesses me
I think of men who have lived and loved there who have groveled and
gloried who have drunk deep and died And then I scribble things like
this




Gods in the Gutter



 I dreamed I saw three demigods who in a cafe sat
 And one was small and crapulous and one was large and fat
 And one was eaten up with vice and verminous at that

 The first he spoke of secret sins and gems and perfumes rare
 And velvet cats and courtesans voluptuously fair
 Who is the Sybarite I asked They answered Baudelaire

 The second talked in tapestries by fantasy beguiled
 As frail as bubbles hard as gems his pageantries he piled
 This Lord of Language who is he They whispered Oscar Wilde

 The third was staring at his glass from out abysmal pain
 With tears his eyes were bitten in beneath his bulbous brain
 Who is the sodden wretch I said They told me Paul Verlaine

 Oh Wilde Verlaine and Baudelaire their lips were wet with wine
 Oh poseur pimp and libertine Oh cynic sot and swine
 Oh votaries of velvet vice    Oh gods of light divine

 Oh Baudelaire Verlaine and Wilde they knew the sinks of shame
 Their sunaspiring wings they scorched at passions altar flame
 Yet lo enthroned enskied they stand Immortal Sons of Fame

 I dreamed I saw three demigods who walked with feet of clay
 With cruel crosses on their backs along a miry way
 Who climbed and climbed the bitter steep to which men turn and pray



And while I am on the subject of the Quarter let me repeat this which
is included in my Ballads of the Boulevards




The Death of Marie Toro



 Were taking Marie Toro to her home in PereLaChaise
 Were taking Marie Toro to her last restingplace
 Behold her hearse is hung with wreaths till everything is hid
 Except the blossoms heaping high upon her coffin lid
 A week ago she roamed the street a draggle and a slut
 A byword of the Boulevard and everybodys butt
 A week ago she haunted us we heard her whining cry
 We brushed aside the broken blooms she pestered us to buy
 A week ago she had not where to rest her weary head   
 But now oh follow follow on for Marie Toros dead

 Oh Marie she was once a queenah yes a queen of queens
 Highthroned above the Carnival she held her splendid sway
 For fourandtwenty crashing hours she knew what glory means
 The cheers of half a million throats the _delire_ of a day
 Yet she was only one of us a little sewinggirl
 Though far the loveliest and best of all our laughing band
 Then Fortune beckoned off she danced amid the dizzy whirl
 And we who once might kiss her cheek were proud to kiss her hand
 For swiftly as a star she soared she had her every wish
 We saw her roped with pearls of price with princes at her call
 And yet and yet I think her dreams were of the old Boul Mich
 And yet Im sure within her heart she loved us best of all
 For one night in the Purple Pig upon the rue SaintJacques
 We laughed and quaffed    a limousine came swishing to the door
 Then Raymond Jolicoeur cried out Its Queen Marie come back
 In satin clad to make us glad and witch our hearts once more
 But no her face was strangely sad and at the evenings end
 Dear lads she said I love you all and when Im far away
 Remember oh remember little Marie is your friend
 And though the world may lie between Im coming back some day
 And so she went and many a boy whos fought his way to Fame
 Can look back on the struggle of his garret days and bless
 The loyal heart the tender hand the Providence that came
 To him and all in hour of need in sickness and distress
 Time passed away She won their hearts in London Moscow Rome
 They worshiped her in Argentine adored her in Brazil
 We smoked our pipes and wondered when she might be coming home
 And then we learned the luck had turned the things were going ill
 Her health had failed her beauty paled her lovers fled away
 And some one saw her in Peru a common drab at last
 So years went by and faces changed our beards were sadly gray
 And Marie Toros name became an echo of the past

 You know that old and withered man that derelict of art
 Who for a paltry franc will make a crayon sketch of you
 In slouching hat and shabby cloak he looks and is the part
 A sodden old Bohemian without a single _sou_
 A boon companion of the days of Rimbaud and Verlaine
 He broods and broods and chews the cud of bitter souvenirs
 Beneath his mop of grizzled hair his cheeks are gouged with pain
 The saffron sockets of his eyes are hollowed out with tears
 Well one night in the DHarcourts din I saw him in his place
 When suddenly the door was swung a woman halted there
 A woman cowering like a dog with white and haggard face
 A broken creature bent of spine a daughter of Despair
 She looked and looked as to her breast she held some withered bloom
 Too late Too late    they all are dead and gone I heard her say
 And once again her weary eyes went round and round the room
 Not one of all I used to know    she turned to go away   
 But quick I saw the old man start Ah no he cried not all
 Oh Marie Toro queen of queens dont you remember Paul

 Oh Marie Marie Toro in my garret next the sky
 Where many a day and night Ive crouched with not a crust to eat
 A picture hangs upon the wall a fortune couldnt buy
 A portrait of a girl whose face is pure and angelsweet
 Sadly the woman looked at him Alas its true she said
 That little maid I knew her once Its long agoshes dead
 He went to her he laid his hand upon her wasted arm
 Oh Marie Toro come with me though poor and sick am I
 For old times sake I cannot bear to see you come to harm
 Ah there are memories God knows that never never die   
 Too late she sighed Ive lived my life of splendor and of shame
 Ive been adored by men of power Ive touched the highest height
 Ive squandered gold like heaps of dirtoh I have played the game
 Ive had my place within the sun    and now I face the night
 Look look you see Im lost to hope I live no matter how   
 To drink and drink and so forget    thats all I care for now

 And so she went her heedless way and all our help was vain
 She trailed along with tattered shawl and mudcorroded skirt
 She gnawed a crust and slept beneath the bridges of the Seine
 A garbage thing a composite of alcohol and dirt
 The students learned her story and the cafes knew her well
 The Pascal and the Pantheon the Sufflot and Vachette
 She shuffled round the tables with the flowers she tried to sell
 A living mask of misery that no one will forget
 And then last week I missed her and they found her in the street
 One morning early huddled down for it was freezing cold
 But when they raised her ragged shawl her face was still and sweet
 Some bits of broken bloom were clutched within her icy hold
 Thats all    Ah yes they say that saw her blue wideopen eyes
 Were beautiful with joy again with radiant surprise   

 A week ago she begged for bread weve bought for her a stone
 And a peaceful place in PereLaChaise where shell be well alone
 She cost a king his crown they say oh wouldnt she be proud
 If she could see the wreaths today the coaches and the crowd
 So follow follow follow on with slow and sober tread
 For Marie Toro gutter waif and queen of queens is dead

The Cafe de Deux Magots

June 1914




The Bohemian



 Up in my garret bleak and bare
 I tilted back on my broken chair
 And my three old pals were with me there
 Hunger and Thirst and Cold
 Hunger scowled at his scurvy mate
 Cold cowered down by the hollow grate
 And I hated them with a deadly hate
 As old as life is old

 So up in my garret thats near the sky
 I smiled a smile that was thin and dry
 Youve roomed with me twenty year said I
 Hunger and Thirst and Cold
 But now begone down the broken stair
 Ive suffered enough of your spite    so there
 Bang Bang I slapped on the table bare
 A glittering heap of gold

 Red flames will jewel my wine tonight
 Ill loose my belt that youve lugged so tight
 Ha Ha Dame Fortune is smiling bright
 The stuff of my brain Ive sold
 _Canaille_ of the gutter up Away
 Youve battened on me for a bitterlong day
 But Im driving you forth and forever and aye
 Hunger and Thirst and Cold

 So I kicked them out with a scornful roar
 Yet oh they turned at the garret door
 Quietly there they spoke once more
 The tale is not all told
 Its _au revoir_ but its not goodby
 Were yours old chap till the day you die
 Laugh on you fool Oh youll never defy
 Hunger and Thirst and Cold



Hurrah The crisis in my financial career is over Once more I have
weathered the storm and never did money jingle so sweetly in my pocket
It was MacBean who delivered me He arrived at the door of my garret
this morning with a broad grin of pleasure on his face

Here said he Ive sold some of your rubbish Theyll take more
too of the same sort

With that he handed me three crisp notes For a moment I thought that
he was paying the money out of his own pocket as he knew I was
desperately hard up but he showed me the letter enclosing the cheque he
had cashed for me

So we sought the Grand Boulevard and I had a Pernod which rose to my
head in delicious waves of joy I talked ecstatic nonsense and seemed
to walk like a god in clouds of gold We dined on frogs legs and
Vouvray and then went to see the Revue at the Marigny A very merry
evening

Such is the life of Bohemia up and down fast and feast its very
uncertainty its charm

Here is my latest ballad another attempt to express the sentiment of
actuality




The Auction Sale



 Her little head just topped the windowsill
 She even mounted on a stool maybe
 She pressed against the pane as children will
 And watched us playing oh so wistfully
 And then I missed her for a month or more
 And idly thought Shes gone away no doubt
 Until a hearse drew up beside the door   
 I saw a tiny coffin carried out

 And after that towards dusk Id often see
 Behind the blind another face that looked
 Eyes of a young wife watching anxiously
 Then rushing back to where her dinner cooked
 She often gulped it down alone I fear
 Within her heart the sadness of despair
 For near to midnight I would vaguely hear
 A lurching step a stumbling on the stair

 These little dramas of the common day
 A man weakwilled and foreordained to fail   
 The windows empty now theyve gone away
 And yonder see their furnitures for sale
 To all the world their door is open wide
 And round and round the bargainhunters roam
 And peer and gloat like vultures avideyed
 Above the corpse of what was once a home

 So reverent I go from room to room
 And see the patient care the tender touch
 The love that sought to brighten up the gloom
 The womancourage tested overmuch
 Amid those things so intimate and dear
 Where now the mob invades with brutal tread
 I think What happiness is buried here
 What dreams are withered and what hopes are dead

 Oh woman dear and were you sweet and glad
 Over the lining of your little nest
 What ponderings and proud ideas you had
 What visions of a shrine of peace and rest
 For theres his easychair upon the rug
 His readinglamp his piperack on the wall
 All that you could devise to make him snug
 And yet you could not hold him with it all

 Ah patient heart what homelike joys you planned
 To stay him by the dull domestic flame
 Those silken cushions that you worked by hand
 When you had time before the baby came
 Oh how you wove around him cozy spells
 And schemed so hard to keep him home of nights
 Aye every touch and turn some story tells
 Of sweet conspiracies and dead delights

 And here upon the scratched piano stool
 Tied in a bundle are the songs you sung
 That cozy that you worked in colored wool
 The Spanish lace you made when you were young
 And lots of modern novels cheap reprints
 And little dainty knickknacks everywhere
 And silken bows and curtains of gay chintz   
 _And oh her tiny crib her folding chair_

 Sweet woman dear and did your heart not break
 To leave this precious home you made in vain
 Poor shabby things so prized for old times sake
 With all their memories of love and pain
 Alas while shouts the raucous auctioneer
 And ratfaced dames are prying everywhere
 The echo of old joy is all I hear
 All all I see just heartbreak and despair



Imagination is the great gift of the gods Given it one does not need
to look afar for subjects There is romance in every face

Those who have Imagination live in a land of enchantment which the eyes
of others cannot see Yet if it brings marvelous joy it also brings
exquisite pain Who lives a hundred lives must die a hundred deaths

I do not know any of the people who live around me Sometimes I pass
them on the stairs However I am going to give my imagination rein
and string some rhymes about them

Before doing so having money in my pocket and seeing the prospect of
making more let me blithely chant about




The Joy of Being Poor



 I

 Let others sing of gold and gear the joy of being rich
 But oh the days when I was poor a vagrant in a ditch
 When every dawn was like a gem so radiant and rare
 And I had but a single coat and not a single care
 When I would feast right royally on bacon bread and beer
 And dig into a stack of hay and doze like any peer
 When I would wash beside a brook my solitary shirt
 And though it dried upon my back I never took a hurt
 When I went romping down the road contemptuous of care
 And slapped Adventure on the backby Gad we were a pair
 When though my pockets lacked a coin and though my coat was old
 The largess of the stars was mine and all the sunset gold
 When time was only made for fools and free as air was I
 And hard I hit and hard I lived beneath the open sky
 When all the roads were one to me and each had its allure   
 Ye Gods these were the happy days the days when I was poor


 II

 Or else again old pal of mine do you recall the times
 You struggled with your storyettes I wrestled with my rhymes
 Oh we were happy were we notwe used to live so high
 A little bit of broken roof between us and the sky
 Upon the forge of art we toiled with hammer and with tongs
 You told me all your rippling yarns I sang to you my songs
 Our hats were frayed our jackets patched our boots were down at heel
 But oh the happy men were we although we lacked a meal
 And if I sold a bit of rhyme or if you placed a tale
 What feasts we had of tenderloins and appletarts and ale
 And yet how often we would dine as cheerful as you please
 Beside our little friendly fire on coffee bread and cheese
 We lived upon the ragged edge and grub was never sure
 But oh these were the happy days the days when we were poor


 III

 Alas old man were wealthy now its sad beyond a doubt
 We cannot dodge prosperity success has found us out
 Your eye is very dull and drear my brow is creased with care
 We realize how hard it is to be a millionaire
 The burdens heavy on our backsyoure thinking of your rents
 Im worrying if Ill invest in five or six per cents
 Weve limousines and marble halls and flunkeys by the score
 We play the part    but say old chap oh isnt it a bore
 We work like slaves we eat too much we put on evening dress
 Weve everything a man can want I think    but happiness

 Come let us sneak away old chum forget that we are rich
 And earn an honest appetite and scratch an honest itch
 Lets be two jolly garreteers up seven flights of stairs
 And wear old clothes and just pretend we arent millionaires
 And wonder how well pay the rent and scribble ream on ream
 And sup on sausages and tea and laugh and loaf and dream

 And when were tired of that my friend oh you will come with me
 And we will seek the sunlit roads that lie beside the sea
 Well know the joy the gipsy knows the freedom nothing mars
 The golden treasuregates of dawn the mintage of the stars
 Well smoke our pipes and watch the pot and feed the crackling fire
 And sing like two old jolly boys and dance to hearts desire
 Well climb the hill and ford the brook and camp upon the moor   
 Old chap lets haste Im mad to taste the Joy of Being Poor

My Garret Montparnasse

June 1914




My Neighbors



 _To rest my fagged brain now and then
 When wearied of my proper labors
 I lay aside my lagging pen
 And get to thinking on my neighbors
 For oh around my garret den
 Theres woe and poverty aplenty
 And lifes so interesting when
 A lad is only twoandtwenty

 Now theres that artist gaunt and wan
 A little card his door adorning
 It reads Je ne suis pour personne
 A very frank and fitting warning
 I fear hes in a sorry plight
 He starves I think too proud to borrow
 I hear him moaning every night
 Maybe theyll find him dead tomorrow_




Room 4 The Painter Chap



 He gives me such a bold and curious look
 That young American across the way
 As if hed like to put me in a book
 Fancies himself a poet so they say
 Ah well Hell make no document of me
 I lock my door Ha ha Now none shall see   

 Pictures just pictures piled from roof to floor
 Each one a bit of me a dream fulfilled
 A vision of the beauty I adore
 My own poor glimpse of glory passionthrilled   
 But now my moneys gone I paint no more

 For three days past I have not tasted food
 The jeweled colors run    I reel I faint
 They tell me that my pictures are no good
 Just crude and childish daubs a waste of paint
 I burned to throw on canvas all I saw
 Twilight on water tenderness of trees
 Wet sands at sunset and the smoking seas
 The peace of valleys and the mountains awe
 Emotion swayed me at the thought of these
 I sought to paint ere I had learned to draw
 And thats the trouble   
 Ah well here am I
 Facing my failure after struggle long
 And there they are my _croutes_ that none will buy
 And doubtless they are right and I am wrong
 Well when ones lost ones faith its time to die   

 This knife will do    and now to slash and slash
 Rip them to ribands rend them every one
 My dreams and visionstear and stab and gash
 So that their crudeness may be known to none
 Poor miserable daubs Ah there its done   

 And now to close my little window tight
 Lo in the dusking sky serenely set
 The evening star is like a beacon bright
 And see to keep her tender tryst with night
 How Paris veils herself in violet   

 Oh why does God create such men as I
 All pride and passion and divine desire
 Raw quivering nervestuff and devouring fire
 Foredoomed to failure though they try and try
 Abortive blindly to destruction hurled
 Unfound unfit to grapple with the world   

 And now to light my wheezy jet of gas
 Chink up the windowcrannies and the door
 So that no single breath of air may pass
 So that Im sealed airtight from roof to floor
 There there thats done and now theres nothing more   

 Look at the citys myriad lamps ashine
 See the calm moon is launching into space   
 There will be darkness in these eyes of mine
 Ere it can climb to shine upon my face
 Oh it will find such peace upon my face   

 City of Beauty I have loved you well
 A laugh or two Ive had but many a sigh
 Ive run with you the scale from Heavn to Hell
 Paris I love you still    goodby goodby
 Thus it all endsunhappily alas
 Its time to sleep and now    _blow out the gas_   


 _Now theres that little _midinette_
 Who goes to work each morning daily
 I choose to call her Blithe Babette
 Because shes always humming gaily
 And though the Goddess Commeilfaut
 May look on her with prim expression
 Its Pagan Paris where you know
 The queen of virtues is Discretion_




Room 6 The Little Workgirl



 Three gentlemen live close beside me
 A painter of pictures bizarre
 A poet whose virtues might guide me
 A singer who plays the guitar
 And there on my lintel is Cupid
 I leave my door open and yet
 These gentlemen arent they stupid
 They never make love to Babette

 I go to the shop every morning
 I work with my needle and thread
 Silk satin and velvet adorning
 Then luncheon on coffee and bread
 Then sewing and sewing till seven
 Or else if the order I get
 I toil and I toil till eleven
 And such is the day of Babette

 It doesnt seem cheerful I fancy
 The wage is unthinkably small
 And yet there is one thing I can say
 I keep a bright face through it all
 I chaff though my head may be aching
 I sing a gay song to forget
 I laugh though my heart may be breaking
 Its all in the life of Babette

 That gown O my lady of leisure
 You begged to be finished in haste
 It gives you an exquisite pleasure
 Your lovers remark on its taste
 Yet    oh the poor little white faces
 The tense midnight toil and the fret   
 I fear that the foam of its laces
 Is salt with the tears of Babette

 It takes a brave heart to be cheery
 With no gleam of hope in the sky
 The futures so utterly dreary
 Im laughingin case I should cry
 And if where the gay lights are glowing
 I dine with a man I have met
 And snatch a bright momentwhos going
 To blame a poor little Babette

 And you Friend beyond all the telling
 Although youre an ocean away
 Your pictures they tell me are selling
 Youre married and settled they say
 Such happiness one wouldnt barter
 Yet oh do you never regret
 The Springtide the roses Montmartre
 Youth poverty love andBabette




 _That blondhaired chap across the way
 With sunny smile and voice so mellow
 He sings in some cheap cabaret
 Yet what a gay and charming fellow
 His breath with garlic may be strong
 What matters it his laugh is jolly
 His day he gives to sleep and song
 His nights made up of song and folly_




 Room 5 The Concert Singer



 Im one of these haphazard chaps
 Who sit in cafes drinking
 A most improper taste perhaps
 Yet pleasant to my thinking
 For oh I hate discord and strife
 Im sadly weakly human
 And I do think the best of life
 Is wine and song and woman

 Now theres that youngster on my right
 Who thinks himself a poet
 And so he toils from morn to night
 And vainly hopes to show it
 And theres that dauber on my left
 Within his chamber shrinking
 He looks like one of hope bereft
 He lives on air Im thinking

 But me I love the things that are
 My heart is always merry
 I laugh and tune my old guitar
 _Sing ho and heydownderry_
 Oh let them toil their lives away
 To gild a tawdry era
 But Ill be gay while yet I may
 _Sing tiraliralira_

 Im sure you know that picture well
 A monk all else unheeding
 Within a bare and gloomy cell
 A musty volume reading
 While through the window you can see
 In sunny glade entrancing
 With cap and bells beneath a tree
 A jester dancing dancing

 Which is the fool and which the sage
 I cannot quite discover
 But you may look in learnings page
 And Ill be laughters lover
 For this our life is none too long
 And hearts were made for gladness
 Let virtue lie in joy and song
 The only sin be sadness

 So let me troll a jolly air
 Come what come will tomorrow
 Ill be no _cabotin_ of care
 No _souteneur_ of sorrow
 Let those who will indulge in strife
 To my most merry thinking
 The true philosophy of life
 Is laughing loving drinking




 _And theres that weird and ghastly hag
 Who walks head bent with lips amutter
 With twitching hands and feet that drag
 And tattered skirts that sweep the gutter
 An outworn harlot lost to hope
 With staring eyes and hair thats hoary
 I hear her gibber dazed with dope
 I often wonder whats her story_




Room 7 The CocoFiend



 I look at no one me
 I pass them on the stair
 Shadows I dont see
 Shadows everywhere
 Haunting taunting staring glaring
 Shadows I dont care
 Once my room I gain
 Then my life begins
 Shut the door on pain
 How the Devil grins
 Grin with might and main
 Grin and grin in vain
 Heres where Heavn begins
 Cocaine Cocaine

 A whiff Ah thats the thing
 How it makes me gay
 Now I want to sing
 Leap laugh play
 Ha Ive had my fling
 Mistress of a king
 In my day
 Just another snuff   
 Oh the blessed stuff
 How the wretched room
 Rushes from my sight
 Misery and gloom
 Melt into delight
 Fear and death and doom
 Vanish in the night
 No more cold and pain
 I am young again
 Beautiful again
 Cocaine Cocaine

 Oh I was made to be good to be good
 For a true mans love and a life thats sweet
 Fireside blessings and motherhood
 Little ones playing around my feet
 How it all unfolds like a magic screen
 Tender and glowing and clear and glad
 The wonderful mother I might have been
 The beautiful children I might have had
 Romping and laughing and shrill with glee
 Oh I see them now and I see them plain
 Darlings Come nestle up close to me
 You comfort me so and youre just    Cocaine

 Its Life thats all to blame
 We cant do what we will
 She robes us with her shame
 She crowns us with her ill
 I do not care because
 I see with bitter calm
 Life made me what I was
 Life makes me what I am
 Could I throw back the years
 It all would be the same
 Hunger and cold and tears
 Misery fear and shame
 And then the old refrain
 Cocaine Cocaine

 A lovechild I so here my mother came
 Where she might live in peace with none to blame
 And how she toiled Harder than any slave
 What courage patient hopeful tender brave
 We had a little room at Lavilette
 So small so neat so clean I see it yet
 Poor mother sewing sewing late at night
 Her wasted face beside the candlelight
 This Paris crushed her How she used to sigh
 And as I watched her from my bed I knew
 She saw red roofs against a primrose sky
 And glistening fields and apples dimmed with dew
 Hard times we had We counted every _sou_
 We sewed sacks for a living I was quick   
 Four busy hands to work instead of two
 Oh we were happy there till she fell sick   

 My mother lay her face turned to the wall
 And I a girl of sixteen fair and tall
 Sat by her side all stricken with despair
 Knelt by her bed and faltered out a prayer
 A doctors order on the table lay
 Medicine for which alas I could not pay
 Medicine to save her life to soothe her pain
 I sought for something I could sell in vain   
 All all was gone The room was cold and bare
 Gone blankets and the cloak I used to wear
 Bare floor and wall and cupboard every shelf
 Nothing that I could sell    except myself

 I sought the street I could not bear
 To hear my mother moaning there
 I clutched the paper in my hand
 Twas hard You cannot understand   
 I walked as martyr to the flame
 Almost exalted in my shame
 They turned who heard my voiceless cry
 For Sale a virgin who will buy
 And so myself I fiercely sold
 And clutched the price a piece of gold
 Into a pharmacy I pressed
 I took the paper from my breast
 I gave my money    how it gleamed
 How precious to my eyes it seemed
 And then I saw the chemist frown
 Quick on the counter throw it down
 Shake with an angry look his head
 Your _louis dor_ is bad he said

 Dazed crushed I went into the night
 I clutched my gleaming coin so tight
 No no I could not well believe
 That any one could so deceive
 I tried again and yet again
 Contempt suspicion and disdain
 Always the same reply I had
 Get out of this Your moneys bad

 Heart broken to the room I crept
 To mothers side All still    she slept   
 I bent I sought to raise her head   
 Oh God have pity she was dead

 Thats how it all began
 Said I Revenge is sweet
 So in my guilty span
 Ive ruined many a man
 Theyve groveled at my feet
 Ive pity had for none
 Ive bled them every one
 Oh Ive had interest for
 That worthless _louis dor_

 But now its over see
 I care for no one me
 Only at night sometimes
 In dreams I hear the chimes
 Of weddingbells and see
 A woman without stain
 With children at her knee
 Ah how you comfort me
 Cocaine   





BOOK THREE  LATE SUMMER




I


The Omnium Bar near the Bourse

Late July 1914

MacBean before he settled down to the manufacture of mercantile
fiction had ideas of a nobler sort which bore their fruit in a slender
book of poems In subject they are either erotic mythologic or
descriptive of nature So polished are they that the mind seems to slide
over them so faultless in form that the critics hailed them with
highest praise and as many as a hundred copies were sold

Saxon Dane too has published a book of poems but he on the other
hand defies tradition to an eccentric degree Originality is his sin
He strains after it in every line I must confess I think much of the
free verse he writes is really prose and a good deal of it blank verse
chopped up into odd lengths He talks of assonance and color of stress
and pause and accent and bewilders me with his theories

He and MacBean represent two extremes and at night as we sit in the
Cafe du Dome they have the hottest of arguments As for me I listen
with awe content that my medium is verse and that the fashions of
Hood Thackeray and Bret Harte are the fashions of today

Of late I have been doing light stuff fillers for MacBean Here are
three of my specimens




The Philanderer



 Oh have you forgotten those afternoons
 With riot of roses and amber skies
 When we thrilled to the joy of a million Junes
 And I sought for your soul in the deeps of your eyes
 I would love you I promised forever and aye
 And I meant it too yet oh isnt it odd
 When we met in the Underground today
 I addressed you as Mary instead of as Maude

 Oh dont you remember that moonlit sea
 With us on a silver trail afloat
 When I gracefully sank on my bended knee
 At the risk of upsetting our little boat
 Oh I vowed that my life was blighted then
 As friendship you proffered with mournful mien
 But now as I think of your children ten
 Im glad you refused me Evangeline

 Oh is that moment eternal still
 When I breathed my love in your shelllike ear
 And you plucked at your fan as a maiden will
 And you blushed so charmingly Guenivere
 Like a worshiper at your feet I sat
 For a year and a day you made me mad
 But now alas you are forty fat
 And I think What a lucky escape I had

 Oh maidens Ive set in a sacred shrine
 Oh Rosamond Molly and Mignonette
 Ive deemed you in turn the most divine
 In turn youve broken my heart    and yet
 Its easily mended Whats past is past
 Today on Lucy Im going to call
 For Im sure that I know true love at last
 And _She_ is the fairest girl of all




The _Petit Vieux_



 Sow your wild oats in your youth so were always told
 But I say with deeper sooth Sow them when youre old
 Ill be wise till Im about seventy or so
 Then by Gad Ill blossom out as an ancient _beau_

 Ill assume a dashing air laugh with loud Ha ha   
 How my grandchildren will stare at their grandpapa
 Their perfection aureoled I will scandalize
 Wont I be a hoary old sinner in their eyes

 Watch me how Ill learn to chaff barmaids in a bar
 Scotches daily gayly quaff puff a fierce cigar
 I will haunt the Tango teas at the stagedoor stand
 Wait for Dolly Dimpleknees bouquet in my hand

 Then at seventy Ill take flutters at roulette
 While at eighty hope Ill make good at poker yet
 And in fashionable togs to the races go
 Gayest of the gay old dogs ninety years or so

 Sow your wild oats while youre young thats what you are told
 Dont believe the foolish tonguesow em when youre old
 Till youre threescore years and ten take my humble tip
 Sow your nice tame oats and then    Hi boys Let er rip




My Masterpiece



 Its slim and trim and bound in blue
 Its leaves are crisp and edged with gold
 Its words are simple stalwart too
 Its thoughts are tender wise and bold
 Its pages scintillate with wit
 Its pathos clutches at my throat
 Oh how I love each line of it
 That Little Book I Never Wrote

 In dreams I see it praised and prized
 By all from plowman unto peer
 Its pencilmarked and memorized
 Its loaned and not returned I fear
 Its worn and torn and traveltossed
 And even dusky natives quote
 That classic that the world has lost
 The Little Book I Never Wrote

 Poor ghost For homes youve failed to cheer
 For grieving hearts uncomforted
 Dont haunt me now    Alas I fear
 The fire of Inspirations dead
 A humdrum way I go tonight
 From all I hoped and dreamed remote
 Too late    a better man must write
 That Little Book I Never Wrote



Talking about writing books there is a queer character who shuffles up
and down the little streets that neighbor the Place Maubert and who
they say has been engaged on one for years Sometimes I see him
cowering in some cheap _bouge_ and his wild eyes gleam at me through
the tangle of his hair But I do not think he ever sees me He mumbles
to himself and moves like a man in a dream His pockets are full of
filthy paper on which he writes from time to time The students laugh at
him and make him tipsy the street boys pelt him with ordure the better
cafes turn him from their doors But who knows At least this is how I
see him




My Book



 Before I drink myself to death
 God let me finish up my Book
 At night I fear I fight for breath
 And wake up whiter than a spook
 And crawl off to a _bistro_ near
 And drink until my brain is clear

 Rare Absinthe Oh it gives me strength
 To write and write and so I spend
 Day after day until at length
 With joy and pain Ill write The End
 Then let this carcase rot I give
 The world my Bookmy Book will live

 For every line is tense with truth
 Theres hope and joy on every page
 A cheer a clarion call to Youth
 A hymn a comforter to Age
 Alls there that I was meant to be
 My part divine the God in me

 Its of my life the golden sum
 Ah who that reads this Book of mine
 In stormy centuries to come
 Will dream I rooted with the swine
 Behold I give mankind my best
 What does it matter all the rest

 Its this that makes sublime my day
 Its this that makes me struggle on
 Oh let them mock my mortal clay
 My spirits deathless as the dawn
 Oh let them shudder as they look   
 Ill be immortal in my Book

 And so beside the sullen Seine
 I fight with dogs for filthy food
 Yet know that from my sin and pain
 Will soar serene a Something Good
 Exultantly from shame and wrong
 A Right a Glory and a Song



How charming it is this Paris of the summer skies Each morning I leap
up with joy in my heart all eager to begin the day of work As I eat my
breakfast and smoke my pipe I ponder over my task Then in the golden
sunshine that floods my little attic I pace up and down absorbed and
forgetful of the world As I compose I speak the words aloud There are
difficulties to overcome thoughts that will not fit their mold
rebellious rhymes Ah those moments of despair and defeat

Then suddenly the mind grows lucid imagination glows the snarl
unravels In the end is always triumph and success O delectable
_metier_ Who would not be a rhymesmith in Paris in Bohemia in the
heart of youth

I have now finished my twentieth ballad Five more and they will be
done In quiet corners of cafes on benches of the Luxembourg on the
sunny Quays I read them over one by one Here is my latest




My Hour



 Day after day behold me plying
 My pen within an office drear
 The dullest dog till homeward hieing
 Then lo I reign a king of cheer
 A throne have I of padded leather
 A little court of kiddies three
 A wife who smiles whateer the weather
 A feast of muffins jam and tea

 The table cleared a romping battle
 A fairy tale a Children bed
 A kiss a hug a hush of prattle
 God save each little drowsy head
 A cozy chat with wife asewing
 A silver lining clouds that lowr
 Then she too goes and with her going
 I come again into my Hour

 I poke the fire I snugly settle
 My pipe I prime with proper care
 The waters purring in the kettle
 Rum lemon sugar all are there
 And now the honest grog is steaming
 And now the trusty briars aglow
 Alas in smoking drinking dreaming
 How sadly swift the moments go

 Oh golden hour twixt love and duty
 All others I to others give
 But you are mine to yield to Beauty
 To glean Romance to greatly live
 For in my easychair reclining   
 _I feel the sting of ocean spray
 And yonder wondrously are shining
 The Magic Isles of Far Away

 Beyond the combers crashing thunder
 Strange beaches flash into my ken
 On jetties heaped headhigh with plunder
 I dance and dice with sailormen
 Strange stars swarm down to burn above me
 Strange shadows haunt strange voices greet
 Strange women lure and laugh and love me
 And fling their bastards at my feet

 Oh I would wish the wide world over
 In ports of passion and unrest
 To drink and drain a tarry rover
 With dragons tattooed on my chest
 With haunted eyes that hold red glories
 Of foaming seas and crashing shores
 With lips that tell the strangest stories
 Of sunken ships and gold moidores

 Till sick of storm and strife and slaughter
 Some ghostly night when hides the moon
 I slip into the milkwarm water
 And softly swim the stale lagoon
 Then through some jungle pythonhaunted
 Or plumed morass or woodland wild
 I win my way with heart undaunted
 And all the wonder of a child

 The pathless plains shall swoon around me
 The forests frown the floods appall
 The mountains tiptoe to confound me
 The rivers roar to speed my fall
 Wild dooms shall daunt and dawns be gory
 And Death shall sit beside my knee
 Till after terror torment glory
 I win again the sea the sea   _

 Oh anguish sweet Oh triumph splendid
 Oh dreams adieu my pipe is dead
 My glass is dry my Hour is ended
 Its time indeed I stole to bed
 How peacefully the house is sleeping
 Ah why should I strange fortunes plan
 To guard the dear ones in my keeping
 Thats task enough for any man

 So through dim seas Ill neer go spoiling
 The red Tortugas never roam
 Please God Ill keep the pot aboiling
 And make at least a happy home
 My childrens path shall gleam with roses
 Their grace abound their joy increase
 And so my Hour divinely closes
 With tender thoughts of praise and peace

The Garden of the Luxembourg

Late July 1914


When on some scintillating summer morning I leap lightly up to the
seclusion of my garret I often think of those lines In the brave days
when I was twentyone

True I have no loving kind Lisette to pin her petticoat across the
pane yet I do live in hope Am I not in Bohemia the Magical Bohemia
of Murger of de Musset of Verlaine Shades of Mimi Pinson of Trilby
of all that immortal line of laughterful grisettes do not tell me that
the days of love and fun are forever at an end

Yes youth is golden but what of age Shall it too not testify to the
rhapsody of existence Let the years between be those of struggle of
sufferanceof disillusion if you will but let youth and age affirm
the ecstasy of being Let us look forward all to a serene sunset and
in the still skies a late lark singing

This thought comes to me as sitting on a bench near the bandstand I
see an old savant who talks to all the children His cleanshaven face
is alive with kindliness under his tall silk hat his white hair falls
to his shoulders He wears a long black cape over a black frockcoat
very neat linen and a flowing tie of black silk I call him Silvester
Bonnard As I look at him I truly think the best of life are the years
between sixty and seventy




A Song of SixtyFive



 Brave Thackeray has trolled of days when he was twentyone
 And bounded up five flights of stairs a gallant garreteer
 And yet again in mellow vein when youth was gaily run
 Has dipped his nose in Gascon wine and told of Forty Year
 But if I worthy were to sing a richer rarer time
 Id tune my pipes before the fire and merrily Id strive
 To praise that age when prose again has given way to rhyme
 The Indian Summer days of life when Ill be Sixtyfive

 For then my work will all be done my voyaging be past
 And Ill have earned the right to rest where folding hills are green
 So in some glassy anchorage Ill make my cable fast
 Oh let the seas show all their teeth Ill sit and smile serene
 The storm may bellow round the roof Ill bide beside the fire
 And many a scene of sail and trail within the flame Ill see
 For Ill have worn away the spur of passion and desire   
 Oh yes when I am Sixtyfive what peace will come to me

 Ill take my breakfast in my bed Ill rise at halfpast ten
 When all the world is nicely groomed and full of golden song
 Ill smoke a bit and joke a bit and read the news and then
 Ill potter round my peachtrees till I hear the luncheon gong
 And after that I think Ill doze an hour well maybe two
 And then Ill show some kindred soul how well my roses thrive
 Ill do the things I never yet have found the time to do   
 Oh wont I be the busy man when I am Sixtyfive

 Ill revel in my library Ill read De Morgans books
 Ill grow so garrulous I fear youll write me down a bore
 Ill watch the ways of ants and bees in quiet sunny nooks
 Ill understand Creation as I never did before
 When gossips round the teacups talk Ill listen to it all
 On smiling days some kindly friend will take me for a drive
 Ill own a shaggy collie dog that dashes to my call
 Ill celebrate my second youth when I am Sixtyfive

 Ah though Ive twenty years to go I see myself quite plain
 A wrinkling twinkling rosycheeked benevolent old chap
 I think Ill wear a tartan shawl and lean upon a cane
 I hope that Ill have silver hair beneath a velvet cap
 I see my little grandchildren aromping round my knee
 So gay the scene I almost wish twould hasten to arrive
 Let others sing of Youth and Spring still will it seem to me
 The golden times the olden time some time round Sixtyfive



From old men to children is but a step and there too in the shadow of
the Fontaine de Medicis I spend much of my time watching the little
ones Childhood so innocent so helpless so trusting is somehow
pathetic to me

There was one jolly little chap who used to play with a large white
Teddy Bear He was always with his mother a sweetfaced woman who
followed his every movement with delight I used to watch them both
and often spoke a few words

Then one day I missed them and it struck me I had not seen them for a
week even a month maybe After that I looked for them a time or two
and soon forgot

Then this morning I saw the mother in the rue DAssas She was alone and
in deep black I wanted to ask after the boy but there was a look in
her face that stopped me

I do not think she will ever enter the garden of the Luxembourg again




Teddy Bear



 O Teddy Bear with your head awry
 And your comical twisted smile
 You rub your eyesdo you wonder why
 Youve slept such a long long while
 As you lay so still in the cupboard dim
 And you heard on the roof the rain
 Were you thinking    what has become of _him_
 And when will he play again

 Do you sometimes long for a chubby hand
 And a voice so sweetly shrill
 O Teddy Bear dont you understand
 Why the house is awfly still
 You sit with your muzzle propped on your paws
 And your whimsical face askew
 Dont wait dont wait for your friend    because
 Hes sleeping and dreaming too

 Aye sleeping long    You remember how
 He stabbed our hearts with his cries
 And oh the dew of pain on his brow
 And the deeps of pain in his eyes
 And Teddy Bear you remember too
 As he sighed and sank to his rest
 How all of a sudden he smiled to you
 And he clutched you close to his breast

 Ill put you away little Teddy Bear
 In the cupboard far from my sight
 Maybe hell come and hell kiss you there
 A wee white ghost in the night
 But me Ill live with my love and pain
 A weariful lifetime through
 And my Hope will I see him again again
 Ah God If I only knew



After old men and children I am greatly interested in dogs I will go
out of my way to caress one who shows any desire to be friendly There
is a very filthy fellow who collects cigarette stubs on the Boul Mich
and who is always followed by a starved yellow cur The other day I came
across them in a little side street The man was stretched on the
pavement brutishly drunk and dead to the world The dog lying by his
side seemed to look at me with sad imploring eyes Though all the
world despise that man I thought this poor brute loves him and will be
faithful unto death

From this incident I wrote the verses that follow




The Outlaw


 A wild and woeful race he ran
 Of lust and sin by land and sea
 Until abhorred of God and man
 They swung him from the gallowstree
 And then he climbed the Starry Stair
 And dumb and naked and alone
 With head unbowed and brazen glare
 He stood before the Judgment Throne

 The Keeper of the Records spoke
 This man O Lord has mocked Thy Name
 The weak have wept beneath his yoke
 The strong have fled before his flame
 The blood of babes is on his sword
 His life is evil to the brim
 Look down decree his doom O Lord
 Lo there is none will speak for him

 The golden trumpets blew a blast
 That echoed in the crypts of Hell
 For there was Judgment to be passed
 And lips were hushed and silence fell
 The man was mute he made no stir
 Erect before the Judgment Seat   
 When all at once a mongrel cur
 Crept out and cowered and licked his feet

 It licked his feet with whining cry
 Come Heavn come Hell what did it care
 It leapt it tried to catch his eye
 Its master yea its God was there
 Then as a thrill of wonder sped
 Through throngs of shining seraphim
 The Judge of All looked down and said
 Lo here is ONE who pleads for him

 And who shall love of these the least
 And who by word or look or deed
 Shall pity show to bird or beast
 By Me shall have a friend in need
 Aye though his sin be black as night
 And though he stand mid men alone
 He shall be softened in My sight
 And find a pleader by My Throne

 So let this man to glory win
 From life to life salvation glean
 By pain and sacrifice and sin
 Until he stand before Me_clean_
 For he who loves the least of these
 And here I say and here repeat
 Shall win himself an angels pleas
 For Mercy at My Judgment Seat



I take my exercise in the form of walking It keeps me fit and leaves
me free to think In this way I have come to know Paris like my pocket
I have explored its large and little streets its stateliness and its
slums

But most of all I love the Quays between the leafage and the sunlit
Seine Like shuttles the little steamers dart up and down weaving the
water into patterns of foam Cigarshaped barges stream under the
lacework of the many bridges and make me think of tranquil days and
willowfringed horizons

But what I love most is the stealing in of night when the sky takes on
that strange elusive purple when eyes turn to the evening star and
marvel at its brightness when the Eiffel Tower becomes a strange
shadowy stairway yearning in impotent effort to the careless moon

Here is my latest ballad short if not very sweet




The Walkers



 _He speaks_

 Walking walking oh the joy of walking
 Swinging down the tawny lanes with head held high
 Striding up the green hills through the heather stalking
 Swishing through the woodlands where the brown leaves lie
 Marveling at all thingswindmills gaily turning
 Apples for the ciderpress rubyhued and gold
 Tails of rabbits twinkling scarlet berries burning
 Wedge of geese highflying in the skys clear cold
 Light in little windows field and furrow darkling
 Home again returning hungry as a hawk
 Whistling up the garden ruddycheeked and sparkling
 Oh but I am happy as I walk walk walk


 _She speaks_

 Walking walking oh the curse of walking
 Slouching round the grim square shuffling up the street
 Slinking down the byway all my graces hawking
 Offering my body to each man I meet
 Peering in the ginshop where the lads are drinking
 Trying to look gaylike crazy with the blues
 Halting in a doorway shuddering and shrinking
 Oh my draggled feather and my thin wet shoes
 Heres a drunken drover Hullo there old dearie
 No he only curses cant be got to talk   
 On and on till daylight famished wet and weary
 God in Heaven help me as I walk walk walk

The Cafe de la Source

Late in July 1914

The other evening MacBean was in a pessimistic mood

Why do you write he asked me gloomily

Obviously I said to avoid starving To produce something that will
buy me food shelter raiment

If you were a millionaire would you still write

Yes I said after a moments thought You get an idea It haunts
you It seems to clamor for expression It begins to obsess you At
last in desperation you embody it in a poem an essay a story There
it is disposed of You are at rest It troubles you no more Yes if I
were a millionaire I should write if it were only to escape from my
ideas

You have given two reasons why men write said MacBean for gain
for selfexpression Then again some men write to amuse themselves
some because they conceive they have a mission in the world some
because they have real genius and are conscious they can enrich the
literature of all time I must say I dont know of any belonging to the
latter class We are living in an age of mediocrity There is no writer
of today who will be read twenty years after he is dead Thats a truth
that must come home to the best of them

I guess theyre not losing much sleep over it I said

Take novelists continued MacBean The line of firstclass novelists
ended with Dickens and Thackeray Then followed some of the second
class Stevenson Meredith Hardy And today we have three novelists
of the third class good capable craftsmen We can trust ourselves
comfortably in their hands We read and enjoy them but do you think
our children will

Yours wont anyway I said

Dont be too sure I may surprise you yet I may get married and turn
_bourgeois_

The best thing that could happen to MacBean would be that It might
change his point of view He is so painfully discouraging I have never
mentioned my ballads to him He would be sure to throw cold water on
them And as it draws near to its end the thought of my book grows more
and more dear to me How I will get it published I know not but I will
Then even if it doesnt sell even if nobody reads it I will be
content Out of this brief perishable Me I will have made something
concrete something that will preserve my thought within its dusty
covers long after I am dead and dust

Here is one of my latest




Poor Peter



 Blind Peter Piper used to play
 All up and down the city
 Id often meet him on my way
 And throw a coin for pity
 But all amid his sparkling tones
 His ear was quick as any
 To catch upon the cobblestones
 The jingle of my penny

 And as upon a day that shone
 He piped a merry measure
 How well you play I chanced to say
 Poor Peter glowed with pleasure
 Youd think the words of praise I spoke
 Were all the pay he needed
 The artist in the player woke
 The penny lay unheeded

 Now Winters here the wind is shrill
 His coat is thin and tattered
 Yet hark hes playing trill on trill
 As if his music mattered
 And somehow though the city looks
 Soaked through and through with shadows
 He makes you think of singing brooks
 And larks and sunny meadows

 Poor chap he often starves they say
 Well well I can believe it
 For when you chuck a coin his way
 Hell let some streetboy thieve it
 I fear he freezes in the night
 My praise Ive long repented
 Yet look his face is all alight   
 Blind Peter seems contented



_A day later_

On the terrace of the Closerie de Lilas I came on Saxon Dane He was
smoking his big briar and drinking a huge glass of brown beer The tree
gave a pleasant shade and he had thrown his sombrero on a chair I
noted how his high brow was bronzed by the sun and there were golden
lights in his broad beard There was something massive and imposing in
the man as he sat there in brooding thought

MacBean he told me was sick and unable to leave his room Rheumatism
So I bought a cooked chicken and a bottle of Barsac and mounting to the
apartment of the invalid I made him eat and drink MacBean was very
despondent but cheered up greatly

I think he rather dreads the future He cannot save money and all he
makes he spends He has always been a rover often tried to settle down
but could not Now I think he wishes for security I fear however it
is too late




The Wistful One



 I sought the trails of South and North
 I wandered East and West
 But pride and passion drove me forth
 And would not let me rest

 And still I seek as still I roam
 A snug roof overhead
 Four walls my own a quiet home   
 Youll have it_when youre dead_



MacBean is one of Bohemias victims It is a country of the young The
old have no place in it He will gradually lose his grip go down and
down I am sorry He is my nearest approach to a friend I do not make
them easily I have deep reserves I like solitude I am never so
surrounded by boon companions as when I am all alone

But though I am a solitary I realize the beauty of friendship and on
looking through my notebook I find the following




If You Had a Friend



 If you had a friend strong simple true
 Who knew your faults and who understood
 Who believed in the very best of you
 And who cared for you as a father would
 Who would stick by you to the very end
 Who would smile however the world might frown
 Im sure you would try to please your friend
 You never would think to throw him down

 And supposing your friend was high and great
 And he lived in a palace rich and tall
 And sat like a King in shining state
 And his praise was loud on the lips of all
 Well then when he turned to you alone
 And he singled you out from all the crowd
 And he called you up to his golden throne
 Oh wouldnt you just be jolly proud

 If you had a friend like this I say
 So sweet and tender so strong and true
 Youd try to please him in every way
 Youd live at your bravestnow wouldnt you
 His worth would shine in the words you penned
 Youd shout his praises    yet now its odd
 You tell me you havent got such a friend
 You havent I wonder    _What of God_



To how few is granted the privilege of doing the work which lies closest
to the heart the work for which one is best fitted The happy man is he
who knows his limitations yet bows to no false gods

MacBean is not happy He is overridden by his appetites and to satisfy
them he writes stuff that in his heart he despises

Saxon Dane is not happy His dream exceeds his grasp His twisted
tortured phrases mock the vague grandiosity of his visions

I am happy My talent is proportioned to my ambition The things I like
to write are the things I like to read I prefer the lesser poets to the
greater the cackle of the barnyard fowl to the scream of the eagle I
lack the divinity of discontent

True Contentment comes from within It dominates circumstance It is
resignation wedded to philosophy a Christian quality seldom attained
except by the old

There is such an one I sometimes see being wheeled about in the
Luxembourg His face is beautiful in its thankfulness




The Contented Man



 How good God is to me he said
 For have I not a mansion tall
 With trees and lawns of velvet tread
 And happy helpers at my call
 With beauty is my life abrim
 With tranquil hours and dreams apart
 You wonder that I yield to Him
 That best of prayers a grateful heart

 How good God is to me he said
 For look though gone is all my wealth
 How sweet it is to earn ones bread
 With brawny arms and brimming health
 Oh now I know the joy of strife
 To sleep so sound to wake so fit
 Ah yes how glorious is life
 I thank Him for each day of it

 How good God is to me he said
 Though health and wealth are gone its true
 Things might be worse I might be dead
 And here Im living laughing too
 Serene beneath the evening sky
 I wait and every mans my friend
 Gods most contented man am I   
 He keeps me smiling to the End



Today the basin of the Luxembourg is bright with little boats Hundreds
of happy children romp around it Little ones everywhere yet there is
no other city with so many childless homes




The Spirit of the Unborn Babe



 The Spirit of the Unborn Babe peered through the windowpane
 Peered through the windowpane that glowed like beacon in the night
 For oh the sky was desolate and wild with wind and rain
 And how the little room was crammed with coziness and light
 Except the flirting of the fire there was no sound at all
 The Woman sat beside the hearth her knitting on her knee
 The shadow of her husbands head was dancing on the wall
 She looked with staring eyes at it she looked yet did not see
 She only saw a childish face that topped the table rim
 A little wistful ghost that smiled and vanished quick away
 And then because her tender eyes were flooding to the brim
 She lowered her head    Dont sorrow dear she heard him softly say
 Its over now Well try to be as happy as before
 Ah they who little children have grant hostages to pain
 We gave Life chance to wound us once but never never more   
 The Spirit of the Unborn Babe fled through the night again

 The Spirit of the Unborn Babe went wildered in the dark
 Like termagants the winds tore down and whirled it with the snow
 And then amid the writhing storm it saw a tiny spark
 A window broad a spacious room all goldenly aglow
 A woman slim and Parisgowned and exquisitely fair
 Who smiled with rapture as she watched her jewels catch the blaze
 A man in faultless evening dress young handsome debonnaire
 Who smoked his cigarette and looked with frank admiring gaze
 Oh we are happy sweet said he youth health and wealth are ours
 What if a thousand toil and sweat that we may live at ease
 What if the hands are worn and torn that strew our path with flowers
 Ah well we did not make the world let us not think of these
 Lets seek the beautyspots of earth Dear Heart just you and I
 Let other women bring forth life with sorrow and with pain
 Above our door well hang the sign _No children need apply_   
 The Spirit of the Unborn Babe sped through the night again

 The Spirit of the Unborn Babe went whirling on and on
 It soared above a city vast it swept down to a slum
 It saw within a grimy house a light that dimly shone
 It peered in through a windowpane and lo a voice said Come
 And so a little girl was born amid the dirt and din
 And lived in spite of everything for life is ordered so
 A child whose eyes first opened wide to swinishness and sin
 A child whose love and innocence met only curse and blow
 And so in due and proper course she took the path of shame
 And gladly died in hospital quite old at twenty years
 And when God comes to weigh it all ah whose shall be the blame
 For all her maimed and poisoned life her torture and her tears
 For oh it is not what we do but what we have not done
 And on that day of reckoning when all is plain and clear
 What if we stand before the Throne bloodguilty every one   
 Maybe the blackest sins of all are Selfishness and Fear




IV



The Cafe de la Paix August 1 1914

Paris and I are out of tune As I sit at this famous corner the faint
breeze is stale and weary stale and weary too the faces that swirl
around me while overhead the electric sign of Somebodys Chocolate
appears and vanishes with irritating insistency The very trees seem
artificial gleaming under the arclights with a raw virility that rasps
my nerves

Poor little trees I mutter growing in all this grime and glare
your only dryads the loitering ladies with the complexions of such
brilliant certainty your only Pipes of Pan orchestral echoes from the
clamorous cafes Exiles of the forest what know you of fullblossomed
winds of redembered sunsets of the gentle admonition of spring rain
Life that would fain be a melody seems here almost a malady I crave
for the balm of Nature the anodyne of solitude the breath of Mother
Earth Tell me O wistful trees what shall I do

Then that stale and weary wind rustles the leaves of the nearest
sycamore and I am sure it whispers Brittany

So tomorrow I am off off to the Land of Little Fields




Finistere



 Hurrah Im off to Finistere to Finistere to Finistere
 My satchels swinging on my back my staff is in my hand
 Ive twenty _louis_ in my purse I know the sun and sea are there
 And so Im starting out today to tramp the golden land
 Ill go alone and glorying with on my lips a song of joy
 Ill leave behind the city with its canker and its care
 Ill swing along so sturdilyoh wont I be the happy boy
 Asinging on the rocky roads the roads of Finistere

 Oh have you been to Finistere and do you know a whingray town
 That echoes to the clatter of a thousand wooden shoes
 And have you seen the fishergirls go gallivantin up and down
 And watched the tawny boats go out and heard the roaring crews
 Oh would you sit with pipe and bowl and dream upon some sunny quay
 Or would you walk the windy heath and drink the cooler air
 Oh would you seek a cradled cove and tussle with the topaz sea
 Pack up your kit tomorrow lad and haste to Finistere

 Oh I will go to Finistere theres nothing that can hold me back
 Ill laugh with Yves and Leon and Ill chaff with Rose and Jeanne
 Ill seek the little quaint _buvette_ thats kept by Mother Merdrinac
 Who wears a cap of many frills and swears just like a man
 Ill yarn with hearty hairy chaps who dance and leap and crack their heels
 Who swallow cupfuls of cognac and never turn a hair
 Ill watch the nutbrown boats come in with mullet plaice and conger eels
 The jeweled harvest of the sea they reap in Finistere

 Yes Ill come back from Finistere with memories of shining days
 Of scaly nets and salty men in overalls of brown
 Of ancient women knitting as they watch the tethered cattle graze
 By little nestling beaches where the gorse goes blazing down
 Of headlands silvering the sea of Calvarys against the sky
 Of scorn of angry sunsets and of Carnac grim and bare
 Oh wont I have the leaping veins and tawny cheek and sparkling eye
 When I come back to Montparnasse and dream of Finistere



_Two days later_

Behold me with staff and scrip footing it merrily in the Land of
Pardons I have no goal When I am weary I stop at some _auberge_ when
I am rested I go on again Neither do I put any constraint on my
spirit No subduing of the mind to the task of the moment I dream to
hearts content

My dreams stretch into the future I see myself a singer of simple
songs a laureate of the underdog I will write books a score of
them I will voyage far and wide I will   

But there Dreams are dangerous They waste the time one should spend
in making them come true Yet when we do make them come true we find
the vision sweeter than the reality How much of our happiness do we
owe to dreams I have in mind one old chap who used to herd the sheep
on my uncles farm




Old David Smail



 He dreamed away his hours in school
 He sat with such an absent air
 The master reckoned him a fool
 And gave him up in dull despair

 When other lads were making hay
 Youd find him loafing by the stream
 Hed take a book and slip away
 And just pretend to fish    and dream

 His brothers passed him in the race
 They climbed the hill and clutched the prize
 He did not seem to heed his face
 Was tranquil as the evening skies

 He lived apart he spoke with few
 Abstractedly through life he went
 Oh what he dreamed of no one knew
 And yet he seemed to be content

 I see him now so old and gray
 His eyes with inward vision dim
 And though he faltered on the way
 Somehow I almost envied him

 At last beside his bed I stood
 And is Life done so soon he sighed
 Its been so rich so full so good
 Ive loved it all   and so he died



_Another day_

Framed in hedgerows of emerald the wheat glows with a caloric fervor
as if gorged with summer heat In the vivid green of pastures old women
are herding cows Calm and patient are their faces as with gentle
industry they bend over their knitting One feels that they are
necessary to the landscape

To gaze at me the fieldworkers suspend the magnificent lethargy of
their labors The men with the reaping hooks improve the occasion by
another pull at the cider bottle under the stook the women raise
apathetic brown faces from the sheaf they are tying every one is a
study in deliberation though the crop is russet ripe and crying to be
cut

Then on I go again amid high banks overgrown with fern and honeysuckle
Sometimes I come on an old mill that seems to have been constructed by
Constable so charmingly does Nature imitate Art By the deserted
house half drowned in greenery the velvety wheel dipping in the
crystal water seems to protest against this prolongation of its toil

Then again I come on its brother the Mill of the Wind whirling its
arms so cheerily as it turns its great white stones for its master the
floury miller by the door

These things delight me I am in a land where Time has lagged where
simple people timorously hug the Past How far away now seems the
welter and swelter of the city the hectic sophistication of the
streets The sense of wonder is strong in me again the joy of looking
at familiar things as if one were seeing them for the first time




The Wonderer



 I wish that I could understand
 The moving marvel of my Hand
 I watch my fingers turn and twist
 The supple bending of my wrist
 The dainty touch of fingertip
 The steel intensity of grip
 A tool of exquisite design
 With pride I think Its mine Its mine

 Then theres the wonder of my Eyes
 Where hills and houses seas and skies
 In waves of light converge and pass
 And print themselves as on a glass
 Line form and color live in me
 I am the Beauty that I see
 Ah I could write a book of size
 About the wonder of my Eyes

 What of the wonder of my Heart
 That plays so faithfully its part
 I hear it running sound and sweet
 It does not seem to miss a beat
 Between the cradle and the grave
 It never falters stanch and brave
 Alas I wish I had the art
 To tell the wonder of my Heart

 Then oh but how can I explain
 The wondrous wonder of my Brain
 That marvelous machine that brings
 All consciousness of wonderings
 That lets me from myself leap out
 And watch my body walk about
 Its hopelessall my words are vain
 To tell the wonder of my Brain

 But do not think O patient friend
 Who reads these stanzas to the end
 That I myself would glorify   
 Youre just as wonderful as I
 And all Creation in our view
 Is quite as marvelous as you
 Come let us on the seashore stand
 And wonder at a grain of sand
 And then into the meadow pass
 And marvel at a blade of grass
 Or cast our vision high and far
 And thrill with wonder at a star
 A host of starsnights holy tent
 Hugeglittering with wonderment

 If wonder is in great and small
 Then what of Him who made it all
 In eyes and brain and heart and limb
 Lets see the wondrous work of Him
 In house and hill and sward and sea
 In bird and beast and flower and tree
 In everything from sun to sod
 The wonder and the awe of God



August 9 1914

For some time the way has been growing wilder Thickset hedges have
yielded to dykes of stone and there is every sign that I am approaching
the rugged region of the coast At each point of vantage I can see a
Cross often a relic of the early Christians stumpy and corroded Then
I come on a slab of gray stone upstanding about fifteen feet Like a
sentinel on that solitary plain it overwhelms me with a sense of
mystery

But as I go on through this desolate land these stones become more and
more familiar Like soldiers they stand in rank extending over the
moor The sky is cowled with cloud save where a sullen sunset shoots
bloodred rays across the plain Bathed in that sinister light stands my
army of stone and a wind swooping down seems to wail amid its ranks
As in a glass darkly I can see the skinclad men the women with their
tangled hair the beastlike feast the cowering terror of the night
Then the sunset is cut off suddenly and a clammy mist shrouds that
silent army So it is almost with a shudder I take my last look at the
Stones of Carnac

But now my pilgrimage is drawing to an end A painter friend who lives
by the sea has asked me to stay with him awhile Well I have walked a
hundred miles singing on the way I have dreamed and dawdled planned
exulted I have drunk buckets of cider and eaten many an omelette that
seemed like a golden glorification of its egg It has all been very
sweet but it will also be sweet to loaf awhile




Oh It Is Good



 Oh it is good to drink and sup
 And then beside the kindly fire
 To smoke and heap the faggots up
 And rest and dream to hearts desire

 Oh it is good to ride and run
 To roam the greenwood wild and free
 To hunt to idle in the sun
 To leap into the laughing sea

 Oh it is good with hand and brain
 To gladly till the chosen soil
 And after honest sweat and strain
 To see the harvest of ones toil

 Oh it is good afar to roam
 And seek adventure in strange lands
 Yet oh so good the coming home
 The velvet love of little hands

 So much is good    We thank Thee God
 For all the tokens Thou hast given
 That here on earth our feet have trod
 Thy little shining trails of Heaven

August 10 1914

I am living in a little house so near the sea that at high tide I can
see on my bedroom wall the reflected ripple of the water At night I
waken to the melodious welter of waves or maybe there is a great
stillness and then I know that the sand and seagrass are lying naked
to the moon But soon the tide returns and once more I hear the
roistering of the waves

Calvert my friend is a lover as well as a painter of nature He rises
with the dawn to see the morning mist kindle to coral and the suns edge
clear the hillcrest As he munches his coarse bread and sips his white
wine what dreams are his beneath the magic changes of the sky He will
paint the same scene under a dozen conditions of light He has looked so
long for Beauty that he has come to see it everywhere

I love this friendly home of his A peace steals over my spirit and I
feel as if I could stay here always Some day I hope that I too may
have such an one and that I may write like this




I Have Some Friends



 I have some friends some worthy friends
 And worthy friends are rare
 These carpet slippers on my feet
 That padded leather chair
 This old and shabby dressinggown
 So well the worse of wear

 I have some friends some honest friends
 And honest friends are few
 My pipe of briar my open fire
 A book thats not too new
 My bed so warm the nights of storm
 I love to listen to

 I have some friends some good good friends
 Who faithful are to me
 My wrestling partner when I rise
 The big and burly sea
 My little boat thats riding there
 So saucy and so free

 I have some friends some golden friends
 Whose worth will not decline
 A tawny Irish terrier a purple shading pine
 A little redroofed cottage that
 So proudly I call mine

 All other friends may come and go
 All other friendships fail
 But these the friends Ive worked to win
 Oh they will never stale
 And comfort me till Time shall write
 The finish to my tale



Calvert tries to paint more than the thing he sees he tries to paint
behind it to express its spirit He believes that Beauty is God made
manifest and that when we discover Him in Nature we discover Him in
ourselves

But Calvert did not always see thus At one time he was a Pagan
content to paint the outward aspect of things It was after his little
child died he gained in vision Maybe the thought that the dead are
lost to us was too unbearable He had to believe in a coming together
again




The Quest



 I sought Him on the purple seas
 I sought Him on the peaks aflame
 Amid the gloom of giant trees
 And canyons lone I called His name
 The wasted ways of earth I trod
 In vain In vain I found not God

 I sought Him in the hives of men
 The cities grand the hamlets gray
 The temples old beyond my ken
 The tabernacles of today
 All life that is from cloud to clod
 I sought    Alas I found not God

 Then after roamings far and wide
 In streets and seas and deserts wild
 I came to stand at last beside
 The deathbed of my little child
 Lo as I bent beneath the rod
 I raised my eyes    and there was God



A golden mile of sand swings hammocklike between two tusks of rock The
sea is sleeping sapphire that wakes to cream and crash upon the beach
There is a majesty in the detachment of its lazy waves and it is good
in the night to hear its friendly roar Good too to leap forth with
the first sunshine and fall into its arms to let it pummel the body to
living ecstasy and send one to breakfast gladeyed and glowing

Behind the house the greensward slopes to a wheatfield that is like a
wall of gold Here I lie and laze away the time or dip into a favorite
book Stevensons _Letters_ or Bellocs _Path to Rome_ Bees drone in
the wild thyme a cuckoo keeps calling a lark spills jeweled melody
Then there is a seeming silence but it is the silence of a deeper
sound

After all Silence is only mans confession of his deafness Like Death
like Eternity it is a word that means nothing So lying there I hear
the breathing of the trees the crepitation of the growing grass the
seething of the sap and the movements of innumerable insects Strange
how I think with distaste of the spurious glitter of Paris of my
garret even of my poor little book

I watch the wife of my friend gathering poppies in the wheat There is a
sadness in her face for it is only a year ago they lost their little
one Often I see her steal away to the village graveyard sitting
silent for long and long




The Comforter



 As I sat by my babys bed
 Thats open to the sky
 There fluttered round and round my head
 A radiant butterfly

 And as I weptof hearts that ache
 The saddest in the land
 It left a lily for my sake
 And lighted on my hand

 I watched it oh so quietly
 And though it rose and flew
 As if it fain would comfort me
 It came and came anew

 Now where my darling lies at rest
 I do not dare to sigh
 For look there gleams upon my breast
 A snowwhite butterfly



My friends will have other children and if some day they should read
this piece of verse perhaps they will think of the city lad who used to
sit under the old figtree in the garden and watch the lizards sun
themselves on the timeworn wall




The Other One



 Gather around me children dear
 The wind is high and the night is cold
 Closer little ones snuggle near
 Lets seek a story of ages old
 A magic tale of a bygone day
 Of lovely ladies and dragons dread
 Come for youre all so tired of play
 Well read till its time to go to bed

 So they all are glad and they nestle in
 And squat on the rough old nursery rug
 And they nudge and hush as I begin
 And the fire leaps up and alls so snug
 And there I sit in the big armchair
 And how they are eager and sweet and wise
 And they cup their chins in their hands and stare
 At the heart of the flame with thoughtful eyes

 And then as I read by the ruddy glow
 And the little ones sit entranced and still   
 _He_s drawing near ah I know I know
 Hes listening too as he always will
 Hes therehes standing beside my knee
 I see him so well my wee wee son   
 Oh children dear dont look at me
 Im reading now forthe Other One

 For the firelight glints in his golden hair
 And his wondering eyes are fixed on my face
 And he rests on the arm of my easychair
 And the books a blur and I lose my place
 And I touch my lips to his shining head
 And my voice breaks down andthe storys done   
 Oh children kiss me and go to bed
 Leave me to think of the Other One

 Of the One who will never grow up at all
 Who will always be just a child at play
 Tender and trusting and sweet and small
 Who will never leave me and go away
 Who will never hurt me and give me pain
 Who will comfort me when Im all alone
 A heart of love thats without a stain
 Always and always my own my own

 Yet a thought shines out from the dark of pain
 And it gives me hope to be reconciled
 _That each of us must be born again
 And live and die as a little child
 So that with souls all shining white
 White as snow and without one sin
 We may come to the Gates of Eternal Light
 Where only children may enter in_

 So gentle mothers dont ever grieve
 Because you have lost but kiss the rod
 From the depths of your woe be glad believe
 Youve given an angel unto God
 Rejoice Youve a child whose youth endures
 Who comes to you when the day is done
 Wistful for love oh yours just yours
 Dearest of all the Other One




Catastrophe



Brittany August 14 1914

And now I fear I must write in another strain Up to this time I have
been too happy I have existed in a magic Bohemia largely of my own
making Hope faith enthusiasm have been mine Each day has had its
struggle its failure its triumph However that is all ended During
the past week we have lived breathlessly For in spite of the exultant
sunshine our spirits have been under a cloud a deepening shadow of
horror and calamity    WAR

Even as I write in our little village steeple the bells are ringing
madly and in every little village steeple all over the land As he
hears it the harvester checks his scythe on the swing the clerk throws
down his pen the shopkeeper puts up his shutters Only in the cafes
there is a clamor of voices and a drowning of care

For here every man must fight every home give tribute There is no
question no appeal By heredity and discipline all minds are shaped to
this great hour So tomorrow each man will seek his barracks and
become a soldier as completely as if he had never been anything else
With the same docility as he dons his baggy red trousers will he let
some muddleheaded General hurl him to destruction for some dubious
gain Today a father a homemaker tomorrow fodder for cannon So
they all go without hesitation without bitterness and the great
military machine that knows not humanity swings them to their fate I
marvel at the sense of duty the resignation the sacrifice It is
magnificent it is FRANCE

And the Women Those who wait and weep Ah today I have not seen one
who did not weep Yes one She was very old and she stood by her
garden gate with her hand on the uplifted latch As I passed she looked
at me with eyes that did not see She had no doubt sons and grandsons
who must fight and she had good reason perhaps to remember the war of
_soixantedix_ When I passed an hour later she was still there her
hand on the uplifted latch


August 30th

The men have gone Only remain graybeards women and children Calvert
and I have been helping our neighbors to get in the harvest No doubt we
aid but there with the old men and children a sense of uneasiness and
even shame comes over me I would like to return to Paris but the
railway is mobilized Each day I grow more discontented Up there in
the red North great things are doing and I am out of it I am thoroughly
unhappy

Then Calvert comes to me with a plan He has a Ford car We will all
three go to Paris He intends to offer himself and his car to the Red
Cross His wife will nurse So we are very happy at the solution and
tomorrow we are off


Paris

Back again Closed shutters deserted streets How glum everything is
Those who are not mobilized seem uncertain how to turn Every one buys
the papers and reads grimly of disaster No news is bad news

I go to my garret as to a beloved friend Everything is just as I left
it so that it seems I have never been away I sigh with relief and
joy I will take up my work again Serene above the storm I will watch
and wait Although I have been brought up in England I am American born
My country is not concerned

So going to the Dome Cafe I seek some of my comrades Strange They
have gone MacBean I am told is in England By dyeing his hair and
lying about his age he has managed to enlist in the Seaforth
Highlanders Saxon Dane too He has joined the Foreign Legion and
even now may be fighting

Well let them go I will keep out of the mess But why did they go I
wish I knew War is murder Criminal folly Against Humanity
Imperialism is at the root of it We are fools and dupes Yes I will
think and write of other things   

_MacBean has enlisted_

I hate violence I would not willingly cause pain to anything
breathing I would rather be killed than kill I will stand above the
Battle and watch it from afar

_Dane is in the Foreign Legion_

How disturbing it all is One cannot settle down to anything Every day
I meet men who tell the most wonderful stories in the most casual way
I envy them I too want to have experiences to live where lifes beat
is most intense But thats a poor reason for going to war

And yet though I shrink from the idea of fighting I might in some way
help those who are MacBean and Dane for example Sitting lonely in
the Dome I seem to see their ghosts in the corner MacBean listening
with his keen sarcastic smile Saxon Dane banging his great hairy fist
on the table till the glasses jump Where are they now Living a life
that I will never know When they come back if they ever do shall I
not feel shamed in their presence Oh this filthy war Things were
going on so beautifully We were all so happy so full of ambition of
hope laughing and talking over pipe and bowl and in our garrets
seeking to realize our dreams Ah these days will never come again

Then as I sit there Calvert seeks me out He has joined an ambulance
corps that is going to the Front Will I come in

Yes I say Ill do anything

So it is all settled Tomorrow I give up my freedom




BOOK FOUR  WINTER




I



The Somme Front January 1915

There is an avenue of noble beeches leading to the Chateau and in the
shadow of each glimmers the pale oblong of an ambulance We have to keep
them thus concealed for only yesterday morning a Taube flew over The
beggars are rather partial to Red Cross cars One of our chaps taking
in a load of wounded was chased and pelted the other day

The Chateau seems all spires and towers the glorified dream of a
Parisian pastrycook On its terrace figures in khaki are lounging They
are the volunteers the ownerdrivers of the Corps many of them men of
wealth and title Curious to see one who owns all the coal in two
counties proudly signing for his _sou_ a day or another who lives in a
Fifth Avenue palace contentedly sleeping on the strawstrewn floor of a
hovel

Here is a rhyme I have made of such an one




Priscilla



 Jerry MacMullen the millionaire
 Driving a redmeat bus out there
 How did he win his _Croix de Guerre_
 Bless you thats all old stuff
 Beast of a night on the Verdun road
 Jerry stuck with a woeful load
 Stalled in the mud where the red lights glowed
 Prospect devilish tough

 Little Priscilla he called his car
 Best of our battered bunch by far
 Branded with many a bullet scar
 Yet running so sweet and true
 Jerry he loved her knew her tricks
 Swore Shes the beat of the best big six
 And if ever I get in a deuce of a fix
 Priscilla will pull me through

 Looks pretty rotten right now says he
 Hanged if the devil himself could see
 Priscilla its up to you and me
 To show em what we can do
 Seemed that Priscilla just took the word
 Up with a leap like a horse thats spurred
 On with the joy of a homing bird
 Swift as the wind she flew

 Shellholes shoot at them out of the night
 A lurch to the left a wrench to the right
 Hands grimgripping and teeth clenched tight
 Eyes that glare through the dark
 Priscilla youre doing me proud this day
 Hospitals only a league away
 And honey Im longing to hit the hay
 So hurry old girl    But hark

 Howl of a shell harsh sudden dread
 Another    another    Strike me dead
 If the Huns aint strafing the road ahead
 So the convoy cant get through
 A barrage of shrap and us alone
 Four rushcasesyou hear em moan
 Fierce old messes of blood and bone   
 Priscilla what shall we do

 Again it seems that Priscilla hears
 With a rush and a roar her way she clears
 Straight at the hell of flame she steers
 Full at its heart of wrath
 Fury of death and dust and din
 Havoc and horror Shes in shes in
 Shes almost over shell win shell win
 _Woof Crump_ right in the path

 Little Priscilla skids and stops
 Jerry MacMullen sways and flops
 Bang in his map the crash he cops
 Shriek from the car Mon Dieu
 One of the _blesses_ hears him say
 Just at the moment he faints away
 Reckon this isnt my lucky day
 Priscilla its up to you

 Sergeant raps on the doctors door
 Car in the court with _couches_ four
 Driver dead on the dashboard floor
 Strange how the bunch got here
 No says the Doc this chaps alive
 But tell me how could a man contrive
 With both arms broken a car to drive
 Thunder of God its queer

 Same little _blesse_ makes a spiel
 Says he When I saw our driver reel
 A Strange Shape leapt to the driving wheel
 And sped us safe through the night
 But Jerry he says in his drawling tone
 Rats Why Priscilla came in on her own
 Bless her she did it alone alone   
 _Hanged if I know whos right_



As I am sitting down to my midday meal an orderly gives me a telegram

_Hill 71 Two couches Send car at once_

The uptilted countryside is a checkerboard of green and gray and
except where groves of trees rise like islands cultivated to the last
acre But as we near the firingline all efforts to till the land cease
and the ungathered beets of last year have grown to seed Amid rank
unkempt fields I race over a road that is pitted with obusholes I pass
a line of guns painted like snakes and drawn by horses dyed khaki
color then soldiers coming from the trenches mudcaked and ineffably
weary then a race over a bit of road that is exposed then buried in
the hillside the dressing station

The two wounded are put into my car From hip to heel one is swathed in
bandages the other has a great white turban on his head with a red
patch on it that spreads and spreads They stare dully but make no
sound As I crank the car there is a shrill screaming noise   
About thirty yards away I hear an explosion like a mineblast followed
by a sudden belch of coalblack smoke I stare at it in a dazed way
Then the doctor says Dont trouble to analyze your sensations Better
get off Youre only drawing their fire

Here is one of my experiences




A Casualty



 That boy I took in the car last night
 With the body that awfully sagged away
 And the lips bloodcrisped and the eyes flamebright
 And the poor hands folded and cold as clay
 Oh Ive thought and Ive thought of him all the day

 For the weary old doctor says to me
 Hell only last for an hour or so
 Both of his legs below the knee
 Blown off by a bomb    So lad go slow
 And please remember he doesnt know

 So I tried to drive with never a jar
 And there was I cursing the road like mad
 When I hears a ghost of a voice from the car
 Tell me old chap have I copped it bad
 So I answers No and he says Im glad

 Glad says he for at twentytwo
 Lifes so splendid I hate to go
 Theres so much good that a chap might do
 And Ive fought from the start and Ive suffered so
 Twould be hard to get knocked out now you know

 Forget it says I then I drove awhile
 And I passed him a cheery word or two
 But he didnt answer for many a mile
 So just as the hospital hove in view
 Says I Is there nothing that I can do

 Then he opens his eyes and he smiles at me
 And he takes my hand in his trembling hold
 Thank youyoure far too kind says he
 Im awfully comfystay    lets see
 I fancy my blankets come unrolled
 My _feet_ please wrap emtheyre cold    theyre cold



 There is a city that glitters on the plain Afar off we can see
 its tall cathedral spire and there we often take our wounded
 from the little village hospitals to the railhead Tragic little buildings
 these emergency hospitalstownhalls churches schools
 their cots are never empty their surgeons never still

 So every day we get our list of cases and off we go a long line of cars
 swishing through the mud Then one by one we branch off
 to our village hospital puzzling out the road on our maps
 Arrived there we load up quickly

 The wounded make no moan They lie limp heavily bandaged
 with bare legs and arms protruding from their blankets
 They do not know where they are going they do not care
 Like live stock they are labeled and numbered An orderly brings along
 their battlescarred equipment throwing open their rifles
 to see that no charge remains Sometimes they shake our hands
 and thank us for the drive

 In the streets of the city I see French soldiers wearing the _Fourragere_
 It is a cord of green yellow or red and corresponds to
 the _Croix de Guerre_ the _Medaille militaire_ and the Legion of Honor
 The red is the highest of all and has been granted only to
 one or two regiments This incident was told to me by a man who saw it




The BloodRed _Fourragere_



 What was the blackest sight to me
 Of all that campaign
 _A naked woman tied to a tree
 With jagged holes where her breasts should be
 Rotting there in the rain_

 On we pressed to the battle fray
 Dogged and dour and spent
 Sudden I heard my Captain say
 _Voila_ Kultur has passed this way
 And left us a monument

 So I looked and I saw our Colonel there
 And his grand head snowed with the years
 Unto the beat of the rain was bare
 And oh there was grief in his frozen stare
 And his cheeks were stung with tears

 Then at last he turned from the woeful tree
 And his face like stone was set
 Go march the Regiment past said he
 That every father and son may see
 And none may ever forget

 Oh the crimson strands of her hair downpoured
 Over her breasts of woe
 And our grim old Colonel leaned on his sword
 And the men filed past with their rifles lowered
 Solemn and sad and slow

 But Ill never forget till the day I die
 As I stood in the driving rain
 And the jaded columns of men slouched by
 How amazement leapt into every eye
 Then fury and grief and pain

 And some would like madmen stand aghast
 With their hands upclenched to the sky
 And some would cross themselves as they passed
 And some would curse in a scalding blast
 And some like children cry

 Yea some would be sobbing and some would pray
 And some hurl hateful names
 But the best had never a word to say
 They turned their twitching faces away
 And their eyes were like hot flames

 They passed then down on his bended knee
 The Colonel dropped to the Dead
 Poor martyred daughter of France said he
 O dearly dearly avenged youll be
 Or ever a day be sped

 Now they hold that we are the best of the best
 And each of our men may wear
 Like a gash of crimson across his chest
 As one fierceproved in the battletest
 The bloodred _Fourragere_

 For each as he leaps to the top can see
 Like an etching of blood on his brain
 A wife or a mother lashed to a tree
 With two black holes where her breasts should be
 Left to rot in the rain

 So we fight like fiends and of us they say
 That we neither yield nor spare
 Oh we have the bitterest debt to pay   
 Have we paid it Lookhow we wear today
 Like a trophy gallant and proud and gay
 Our bloodred _Fourragere_



It is often weary waiting at the little _poste de secours_ Some of us
play solitaire some read a sixpenny some doze or try to talk in bad
French to the _poilus_ Around us is discomfort dirt and drama

For my part I pass the time only too quickly trying to put into verse
the incidents and ideas that come my way In this way I hope to collect
quite a lot of stuff which may some day see itself in print

Here is one of my efforts




Jim


 Never knew Jim did you Our boy Jim
 Bless you there was the likely lad
 Supple and straight and long of limb
 Clean as a whistle and just as glad
 Always laughing wasnt he dad
 Joy pure joy to the heart of him
 And oh but the soothering ways he had
 Jim our Jim

 But I see him best as a tiny tot
 A bonny babe though its me that speaks
 Laughing there in his little cot
 With his sunny hair and his apple cheeks
 And my but the blue blue eyes hed got
 And just where his wee mouth dimpled dim
 Such a fairy mark like a beauty spot
 That was Jim

 Oh the war the war How my eyes were wet
 But he says Dont be sorrowing mother dear
 You never knew me to fail you yet
 And Ill be back in a year a year
 Twas at Mons he fell in the first attack
 For so they said and their eyes were dim
 But I laughed in their faces Hell come back
 Will my Jim

 Now wed been wedded for twenty year
 And Jim was the only one wed had
 So when I whispered in fathers ear
 He wouldnt believe mewould you dad
 There I must hurry    hear him cry
 My new little baby    See thats him
 What are we going to call him Why
 Jim just Jim

 Jim For look at him laughing there
 In the same old way in his tiny cot
 With his rosy cheeks and his sunny hair
 And look just look    his beauty spot
 In the selfsame place    Oh I cant explain
 And of course you think its a mothers whim
 But I know I know its my boy again
 Same wee Jim

 Just come back as he said he would
 Come with his love and his heart of glee
 Oh I cried and I cried but the Lord was good
 From the shadow of Death he set Jim free
 So Ill have him all over again you see
 Can you wonder my motherhearts abrim
 Oh how happy were going to be
 Arent we Jim

In Picardy

January 1915

The road lies amid a malevolent heath It seems to lead us right into
the clutch of the enemy for the starshells that at first were
bursting overhead gradually encircle us The fields are strangely
sinister the splintered trees are like giant toothpicks There is a
lisping and a twanging overhead

As we wait at the door of the dugout that serves as a firstaid dressing
station I gaze up into that mysterious dark so alive with musical
vibrations Then a small shadow detaches itself from the greater
shadow and a graybearded sentry says to me Youd better come in out
of the bullets

So I keep under cover and presently they bring my load Two men drip
with sweat as they carry their comrade I can see that they all three
belong to the Foreign Legion I think for a moment of Saxon Dane How
strange if some day I should carry him Half fearfully I look at my
passenger but he is a black man Such things only happen in fiction

This is what I have written of the finest troops in the Army of France




Kelly of the Legion


 Now Kelly was no fighter
 He loved his pipe and glass
 An easygoing blighter
 Who lived in Montparnasse
 But mid the tavern tattle
 He heard some guinney say
 When France goes forth to battle
 The Legion leads the way

 _The scourings of creation
 Of every sin and station
 The men whove known damnation
 Are picked to lead the way_

 Well Kelly joined the Legion
 They marched him day and night
 They rushed him to the region
 Where largest loomed the fight
 Behold your mighty mission
 Your destiny said they
 By glorious tradition
 The Legion leads the way

 _With tattered banners flying
 With trail of dead and dying
 On On All hell defying
 The Legion sweeps the way_

 With grim hardbitten faces
 With jests of savage mirth
 They swept into their places
 The men of iron worth
 Their blooded steel was flashing
 They swung to face the fray
 Then rushing roaring crashing
 The Legion cleared the way

 _The trail they blazed was gory
 Few lived to tell the story
 Through death they plunged to glory
 But oh they cleared the way_

 Now Kelly lay adying
 And dimly saw advance
 With split new banners flying
 The _fantassins_ of France
 Then up amid the _melee_
 He rose from where he lay
 Come on me boys says Kelly
 The Layjun lades the way

 _Aye while they faltered doubting
 Such flames of doom were spouting
 He caught them thrilled them shouting
 The Layjun lades the way_

 They saw him slip and stumble
 Then stagger on once more
 They marked him trip and tumble
 A mass of grime and gore
 They watched him blindly crawling
 Amid hells own affray
 And calling calling calling
 The Layjun lades the way

 _And even while they wondered
 The battlewrack was sundered
 To Victory they thundered
 But    Kelly led the way_

 Still Kelly kept agoing
 Berserkerlike he ran
 His eyes with fury glowing
 A lion of a man
 His rifle madly swinging
 His soul athirst to slay
 His slogan ringing ringing
 The Layjun lades the way

 _Till in a pit deathbaited
 Where Huns with Maxims waited
 He plunged    and there bloodsated
 To death he stabbed his way_

 Now Kelly was a fellow
 Who simply loathed a fight
 He loved a tavern mellow
 Grog hot and pipe alight
 Im sure the Show appalled him
 And yet without dismay
 When Death and Duty called him
 He up and led the way

 _So in Valhalla drinking
 If heroes meek and shrinking
 Are suffered there Im thinking
 Tis Kelly leads the way_



We have just had one of our men killed a young sculptor of immense
promise

When one thinks of all the fine work he might have accomplished it
seems a shame But after all tomorrow it may be the turn of any of
us If it should be mine my chief regret will be for work undone

Ah I often think of how I will go back to the Quarter and take up the
old life again How sweet it will all seem But first I must earn the
right And if ever I do go back how I will find Bohemia changed
Missing how many a face

It was in thinking of our lost comrade I wrote the following




The Three Tommies



 That Barret the painter of pictures what feeling for color he had
 And Fanning the maker of music such melodies mirthful and mad
 And Harley the writer of stories so whimsical tender and glad

 To hark to their talk in the trenches high heart unfolding to heart
 Of the day when the war would be over and each would be true to his part
 Upbuilding a Palace of Beauty to the wonder and glory of Art   

 Yons Barret the painter of pictures yon carcass that rots on the wire
 His hand with its sensitive cunning is crisped to a cinder with fire
 His eyes with their magical vision are bubbles of glutinous mire

 Poor Fanning He sought to discover the symphonic note of a shell
 There are bits of him broken and bloody to show you the place where he fell
 Ive reason to fear on his exquisite ear the rats have been banqueting well

 And speaking of Harley the writer I fancy I looked on him last
 Sprawling and staring and writhing in the roar of the battle blast
 Then a mad gunteam crashed over and scattered his brains as it passed

 Oh Harley and Fanning and Barret they were bloody good mates o mine
 Their bodies are empty bottles Death has guzzled the wine
 Whats left of thems filth and corruption    Where is the Fire Divine

 Ill tell you    At night in the trenches as I watch and I do my part
 Three radiant spirits Im seeing high heart revealing to heart
 And theyre building a peerless palace to the splendor and triumph of Art

 Yet alas for the fame of Barret the glory he might have trailed
 And alas for the name of Fanning a star that beaconed and paled
 Poor Harley obscure and forgotten   
 Well who shall say that they failed

 No each did a Something Grander than ever he dreamed to do
 And as for the work unfinished all will be paid their due
 The broken ends will be fitted the balance struck will be true

 So painters and players and penmen I tell you Do as you please
 Let your fame outleap on the trumpets youll never rise up to these
 To three grim and gory Tommies down down on your bended knees



Daventry the sculptor is buried in a little graveyard near one of our
posts Just now our section of the line is quiet so I often go and sit
there Stretching myself on a flat stone I dream for hours

Silence and solitude How good the peace of it all seems Around me the
grasses weave a pattern and half hide the hundreds of little wooden
crosses Here is one with a single name


 AUBREY

 Who was Aubrey I wonder Then another

 _To Our Beloved Comrade_


Then one which has attached to it in the cheapest of little frames the
crude watercolor daub of a child three purple flowers standing in a
yellow vase Below it painfully printed I read

 _To My Darling PapaThy Little Odette_


And beyond the crosses many fresh graves have been dug With hungry open
mouths they wait Even now I can hear the guns that are going to feed
them Soon there will be more crosses and more and more Then they
will cease and wives and mothers will come here to weep

Ah Peace so precious must be bought with blood and tears Let us honor
and bless the men who pay and envy them the manner of their dying for
not all the jeweled orders on the breasts of the living can vie in glory
with the little wooden cross the humblest of these has won   




The Twa Jocks

Near Albert

February 1915

Over the spine of the ridge a horned moon of reddish hue peers through
the splintered haglike trees Where the trenches are rockets are
rising green and red I hear the coughing of the Maxims the peevish
nagging of the rifles the boom of a heavy and the hollow sound of its
exploding shell

Running the car into the shadow of a ruined house I try to sleep But a
battery starts to blaze away close by and the flame lights up my
shelter Near me some soldiers are in deep slumber one stirs in his
sleep as a big rat runs over him and I know by experience that when one
is sleeping a rat feels as heavy as a sheep

But how _can_ one possibly sleep Out there in the dark there is the
wild tattoo of a thousand rifles and hark that dull roar is the
explosion of a mine There the purring of the rapid firers Desperate
things are doing There will be lots of work for me before this night
is over What a cursed place

As I cannot sleep I think of a story I heard today It is of a
Canadian Colonel and in my mind I shape it like this




His Boys



 Im going Billy old fellow Hist lad Dont make any noise
 Theres Boches to beat all creation the pitch of a bomb away
 Ive fixed the note to your collar youve got to get back to my Boys
 Youve got to get back to warn em before its the break of day

 The order came to go forward to a trenchline traced on the map
 I knew the brasshats had blundered I knew and I told em so
 I knew if I did as they ordered I would tumble into a trap
 And I tried to explain but the answer came like a pistol Go

 Then I thought of the Boys I commandedI always called them my Boys
 The men of my own recruiting the lads of my countryside
 Tested in many a battle I knew their sorrows and joys
 And I loved them all like a father with more than a fathers pride

 To march my Boys to a shambles as soon as the dawn of day
 To see them helplessly slaughtered if all that I guessed was true
 My Boys that trusted me blindly I thought and I tried to pray
 And then I arose and I muttered Its either them or its you

 I rose and I donned my raincoat I buckled my helmet tight
 I remember you watched me Billy as I took my cane in my hand
 I vaulted over the sandbags into the pitchy night
 Into the pitted valley that served us as No Mans Land

 I strode out over the hollow of hate and havoc and death
 From the heights the guns were angry with a vengeful snarling of steel
 And once in a moment of stillness I heard hard panting breath
 And I turned    it was you old rascal following hard on my heel

 I fancy I cursed you Billy but not so much as I ought
 And so we went forward together till we came to the valley rim
 And then a starshell sputtered    it was even worse than I thought
 For the trench they told me to move in was packed with Boche to the brim

 They saw me too and they got me they peppered me till I fell
 And there I scribbled my message with my lifeblood ebbing away
 Now Billy you fat old duffer youve got to get back like hell
 And get them to cancel that order before its the dawn of day

 Billy old boy I love you I kiss your shiny black nose
 Now home there    Hurry you devil
 or Ill cut you to ribands    See   
 Poor brute hes off and Im dying    I go as a soldier goes
 Im happy My Boys God bless em    It had to be them or me



Ah I never was intended for a job like this I realize it more and
more every day but I will stick it out till I break down To be
nervous overimaginative terribly sensitive to suffering is a poor
equipment for the man who starts out to drive wounded on the
battlefield I am haunted by the thought that my car may break down
when I have a load of wounded Once indeed it did and a man died while
I waited for help Now I never look at what is given me It might
unnerve me

I have been at it for over six months without a rest When an attack
has been going on I have worked day and night until as I drove I wanted
to fall asleep at the wheel

The winter has been trying there is rain one day frost the next Mud
up to the axles One sleeps in lousy barns or dripping dugouts Cold
hunger dirt I know them all singly and together My only consolation
is that the war must soon be over and that I will have helped When I
have time and am not too tired I comfort myself with scribbling




The BoobyTrap



 Im crawlin out in the mangolds to bury wots left o Joe
 Joe my pal and a good un God ow it rains and rains
 Im sick o seein him lyin like a eap o offal and so
 Im crawlin out in the beetfield to bury is last remains

 E might a bin makin munitionse adnt no need to go
 An I tells im strite but e arnsers Taint no use chewin the fat
 Ive got to be doin me dooty wiv the rest o the boys    an so
 Yons im yon blob on the beetfield wot Im tryin so ard to git at

 There was five of us lads from the brickyard Enry was gassed at Bapome
 Sydney was drowned in a crater Erbert was alved by a shell
 Joe was the pick o the posy might a bin sifely at ome
 Only son of is mother er a widder as well

 She used to sell bobbins and buttonsad a plice near the Waterloo Road
 A little old bentover lydy wiv glasses an silvery air
 Must tell er I planted im nicely
 cheer er up like    Well Im blowed
 That bullet near catched me a bifferIll see the old gel if Im spared

 Shell tike it to eart pore ol lydy fer e was er ope and er joy
 Is dad used to drink like a knotole she kept the ome goin she did
 She pinched and she scriped fer is scoolin e was sich a fine andsome boy
 Alf Flanders seems packed on me panties
 es andsome no longer pore kid

 This bit o a board that Im packin and draggin around in the mire
 I was tickled to death when I found it Says I Eres a nice little glow
 I was chilled and wet through to the marrer so I started to make me a fire
 And then I says No ere Goblimy itll do for a cross for Joe

 Well ere e is Gawd Ow one chinges alyin six weeks in the rain
 Joe me old pal ow Im sorry so elp me I wish I could pray
 An now I ad best get adiggin is grave it seems more like a drain
 And I opes that the Boches wont git me till I gits im safe planted away

 _As he touches the body there is a tremendous explosion
 He falls back shattered_

 A boobytrap Ought to a known it If thats not a bastardly trick
 Well one thing I wont be long goin Gawd Im a ell of a sight
 Wish Id died fightin and killin thats wot it is makes me sick   
 Ah Joe well be pushin up dysies   
 together old Chummie    goodnight



Today I heard that MacBean had been killed in Belgium I believe he
turned out a wonderful soldier Saxon Dane too has been missing for
two months We know what that means

It is odd how one gets callous to death a mediaeval callousness When
we hear that the best of our friends have gone West we have a moment of
the keenest regret but how soon again we find the heart to laugh The
saddest part of loss I think is that one so soon gets over it

Is it that we fail to realize it all Is it that it seems a strange and
hideous dream from which we will awake and rub our eyes

Oh how bitter I feel as the days go by It is creeping more and more
into my verse Read this




Bonehead Bill



 I wonder oo and wot e was
 That Un I got so slick
 I couldnt see is face because
 The night was ideous thick
 I just made out among the black
 A blinkin wedge o white
 Then _biff_ I guess I got im _crack_
 The man I killed last night

 I wonder if account o me
 Some wench will go unwed
 And eaps o lives will never be
 Because es stark and dead
 Or if is missis damns the war
 And by some candle light
 Towheaded kids are prayin for
 The Fritz I copped last night

 I wonder struth I wonder why
 I ad that orful dream
 I saw up in the giddy sky
 The gates o God agleam
 I saw the gates o eaven shine
 Wiv everlastin light
 And then    I knew that Id got mine
 As e got is last night

 Aye bang beyond the broodin mists
 Where spawn the mother stars
 I ammered wiv me bloody fists
 Upon them golden bars
 I ammered till a devils doubt
 Fair froze me wiv affright
 To fink wot God would say about
 The bloke I corpsed last night

 I ushed I wilted wiv despair
 When like a rosy flame
 I sees a angel standin there
 Oo calls me by me name
 E ad such soft such shiny eyes
 E eld is and and smiled
 And through the gates o Paradise
 E led me like a child

 E led me by them golden palms
 Wot ems that jeweled street
 And seraphs was asingin psalms
 Youve no ideer ow sweet
 Wiv cheroobs crowdin closer round
 Than peas is in a pod
 E led me to a shiny mound
 Where beams the throne o God

 And then I ears Gods werry voice
 Bill agan ave no fear
 Stand up and glory and rejoice
 For im oo led you ere
 And in a nip I seemed to see
 Aye like a flash o light
 _My angel pal I knew to be
 The chap I plugged last night_

 Now I dont claim to understand
 They calls me Bonehead Bill
 They shoves a rifle in me and
 And show me ow to kill
 Me jobs to risk me life and limb
 But    be it wrong or right
 This cross Im makin its for im
 The cove I croaked last night

A Lapse of Time and a Word of Explanation

The American Hospital Neuilly

January 1919

Four years have passed and it is winter again Much has happened When
I last wrote on the Somme in 1915 I was sickening with typhoid fever
All that spring I was in hospital

Nevertheless I was sufficiently recovered to take part in the Champagne
battle in the fall of that year and to carry on during the following
winter It was at Verdun I got my first wound

In the spring of 1917 I again served with my Corps but on the entry of
the United States into the War I joined the army of my country In the
Argonne I had my left arm shot away

As far as time and health permitted I kept a record of these years and
also wrote much verse All this however has disappeared under
circumstances into which there is no need to enter here The loss was a
cruel one almost more so than that of my arm for I have neither the
heart nor the power to rewrite this material

And now in default of something better I have bundled together this
manuscript and have added to it a few more verses written in
hospitals Let it represent me If I can find a publisher for it _tant
mieux_ If not I will print it at my own cost and any one who cares
for a copy can write to me

Michael



 Theres something in your face Michael Ive seen it all the day
 Theres something quare that wasnt there when first ye wint away   

 Its just the Army life mother the drill the left and right
 That puts the stiffinin in yer spine and locks yer jaw up tight   

 Theres something in your eyes Michael an how they stare and stare
 Youre lookin at me now me boy as if I wasnt there   

 Its just the things Ive seen mother the sights that come and come
 A bit o broken bloody pulp that used to be a chum   

 Theres something on your heart Michael that makes ye wake at night
 And often when I hear ye moan I trimble in me fright   

 Its just a man I killed mother a mothers son like me
 It seems hes always hauntin me hell never let me be   

 But maybe he was bad Michael maybe it was right
 To kill the inimy you hate in fair and honest fight   

 I did not hate at all mother he never did me harm
 I think he was a lad like me who worked upon a farm   

 And whats it all about Michael why did you have to go
 A quiet peaceful lad like you and we were happy so   

 Its thim thats up above mother its thim that sits an rules
 Weve got to fight the wars they make its us as are the fools   

 And what will be the end Michael and whats the use I say
 Of fightin if whoever wins its us thats got to pay   

 Oh it will be the end mother when lads like him and me
 That sweat to feed the ones above decide that well be free   

 And when will that day come Michael and when will fightin cease
 And simple folks may till their soil and live and love in peace   

 Its coming soon and soon mother its nearer every day
 When only men who work and sweat will have a word to say
 When all who earn their honest bread in every land and soil
 Will claim the Brotherhood of Man the Comradeship of Toil
 When we the Workers all demand What are we fighting for   
 Then then well end that stupid crime that devils madnessWar




The Wife


 Tell Annie Ill be home in time
 To help her with her Christmastree
 Thats what he wrote and hark the chime
 Of Christmas bells and where is he
 And how the house is dark and sad
 And Annies sobbing on my knee

 The page beside the candleflame
 With cruel type was overfilled
 I read and read until a name
 Leapt at me and my heart was stilled
 My eye crept up the columnup
 Unto its hateful heading _Killed_

 And there was Annie on the stair
 And will he not be long she said
 Her eyes were bright and in her hair
 Shed twined a bit of riband red
 And every step was daddys sure
 Till tired out she went to bed

 And there alone I sat so still
 With staring eyes that did not see
 The room was desolate and chill
 And desolate the heart of me
 Outside I heard the newsboys shrill
 Another Glorious Victory

 A victory    Ah what care I
 A thousand victories are vain
 Here in my ruined home I cry
 From out my black despair and pain
 Id rather rather damned defeat
 And have my man with me again

 They talk to us of pride and power
 Of Empire vast beyond the sea
 As here beside my hearth I cower
 What mean such words as these to me
 Oh will they lift the clouds that lowr
 Or light my load in years to be

 What matters it to us poor folk
 Who win or lose its we who pay
 Oh I would laugh beneath the yoke
 If I had _him_ at home today
 Ones home before ones country comes
 Aye so a million women say

 Hush Annie dear dont sorrow so
 How can I tell her See well light
 With tiny star of purest glow
 Each little candle pink and white
 They make mistakes Ill tell myself
 I did not read that name aright
 Come dearest one come let us pray
 Beside our gleaming Christmastree
 Just fold your little hands and say
 These words so softly after me
 God pity mothers in distress
 And little children fatherless

 _God pity mothers in distress
 And little children fatherless_

     

 Whats thata step upon the stair
 A shoutthe door thrown open wide
 My hero and my man is there
 And Annies leaping by his side   
 The room reels round I faint I fall   
 O God Thy world is glorified




Victory Stuff



 What dye think lad what dye think
 As the roaring crowds go by
 As the banners flare and the brasses blare
 And the great guns rend the sky
 As the women laugh like theyd all gone mad
 And the champagne glasses clink
 Oh youre grippin me hand so tightly lad
 Im awonderin what dye think

 Dye think o the boys we used to know
 And how theyd have topped the fun
 Tom and Charlie and Jack and Joe
 Gone now every one
 How theyd have cheered as the joybells chime
 And they grabbed each girl for a kiss
 And nowtheyre rottin in Flanders slime
 And they gave their livesfor _this_

 Or else dye think of the many a time
 We wished we too was dead
 Up to our knees in the freezin grime
 With the fires of hell overhead
 When the youth and the strength of us sapped away
 And we cursed in our rage and pain
 And yetwe havent a word to say   
 Were glad Wed do it again

 Im scared that they pity us Come old boy
 Lets leave them their flags and their fuss
 Wed surely be hatin to spoil their joy
 With the sight of such wrecks as us
 Lets slip away quietly you and me
 And well talk of our chums out there
 _You with your eyes thatll never see
 Me thats wheeled in a chair_




Was It You



 Hullo young Jones with your tie so gay
 And your pen behind your ear
 Will you mark my cheque in the usual way
 For Im overdrawn I fear
 Then you look at me in a manner bland
 As you turn your ledgers leaves
 And you hand it back with a soft white hand
 And the air of a man who grieves   

 _Was it you young Jones was it you I saw
 And I think I see you yet
 With a live bomb gripped in your grimy paw
 And your face to the parapet
 With your lips asnarl and your eyes gone mad
 With a fury that thrilled you through   
 Oh I look at you now and I think my lad
 Was it you young Jones was it you_

 Hullo young Smith with your wellfed look
 And your coat of dapper fit
 Will you recommend me a decent book
 With nothing of War in it
 Then you smile as you polish a fingernail
 And your eyes serenely roam
 And you suavely hand me a thrilling tale
 By a man who stayed at home

 _Was it you young Smith was it you I saw
 In the battles storm and stench
 With a roar of rage and a wound redraw
 Leap into the reeking trench
 As you stood like a fiend on the firingshelf
 And you stabbed and hacked and slew   
 Oh I look at you and I ask myself
 Was it you young Smith was it you_

 Hullo old Brown with your ruddy cheek
 And your tummys rounded swell
 Your gardens looking jolly _chic_
 And your kiddies awfly well
 Then you beam at me in your cheery way
 As you swing your watercan
 And you mop your brow and you blithely say
 What about golf old man

 _Was it you old Brown was it you I saw
 Like a bulldog stick to your gun
 A cursing devil of fang and claw
 When the rest were on the run
 Your eyes aflame with the battlehate   
 As you sit in the family pew
 And I see you rising to pass the plate
 I ask Old Brown was it you_

 Was it me and you Was it you and me
 Is that grammar or is it not
 Who groveled in filth and misery
 Who gloried and groused and fought
 Which is the wrong and which is the right
 Which is the false and the true
 The man of peace or the man of fight
 Which is the ME and the YOU

Les Grands Mutiles



 _I saw three wounded of the war
 And the first had lost his eyes
 And the second went on wheels and had
 No legs below the thighs
 And the face of the third was featureless
 And his mouth ran cornerwise
 So I made a rhyme about each one
 And this is how my fancies run_




The Sightless Man


 Out of the night a crash
 A roar a rampart of light
 A flame that leaped like a lash
 Searing forever my sight
 Out of the night a flash
 Then oh forever the Night

 Here in the dark I sit
 I who so loved the sun
 Supple and strong and fit
 In the dark till my days be done
 Aye thats the hell of it
 Stalwart and twentyone

 Marie is stanch and true
 Willing to be my wife
 Swears she has eyes for two   
 Aye but its long is Life
 What is a lad to do
 With his heart and his brain at strife

 There now my pipe is out
 No one to give me a light
 I grope and I grope about
 Well it is nearly night
 Sleep may resolve my doubt
 Help me to reason right   

 _He sleeps and dreams_

 I heard them whispering there by the bed   
 Oh but the ears of the blind are quick
 Every treacherous word they said
 Was a stab of pain and my heart turned sick
 Then lip met lip and they looked at me
 Sitting bent by the fallen fire
 And they laughed to think that I couldnt see
 But I felt the flame of their hot desire
 Hes helping Marie to work the farm
 A dashing upstanding chap they say
 And look at me with my flabby arm
 And the fat of sloth and my face of clay
 Look at me as I sit and sit
 By the side of a fire thats seldom lit
 Sagging and weary the livelong day
 When every one else is out on the field
 Sowing the seed for a golden yield
 Or tossing around the newmown hay   

 Oh the shimmering wheat that frets the sky
 Gold of plenty and blue of hope
 Im seeing it all with an inner eye
 As out of the door I grope and grope
 And I hear my wife and her lover there
 Whispering whispering round the rick
 Mocking me and my sightless stare
 As I fumble and stumble everywhere
 Slapping and tapping with my stick
 Old and weary at thirtyone
 Heartsick wishing it all was done
 Oh Ill tap my way around to the byre
 And Ill hear the cows as they chew their hay
 There at least there is none to tire
 There at least I am not in the way
 And theyll look at me with their velvet eyes
 And Ill stroke their flanks with my womans hand
 And theyll answer to me with soft replies
 And somehow I fancy theyll understand
 And the horses too they know me well
 Im sure that they pity my wretched lot
 And the big fat ram with the jingling bell   
 Oh the beasts are the only friends Ive got
 And my old dog too he loves me more
 I think than ever he did before
 Thank God for the beasts that are all so kind
 That know and pity the helpless blind

 Ha theyre coming the loving pair
 My hands ashake as my pipe I fill
 What if I steal on them unaware
 With a reapinghook to kill to kill   
 Ill do it    theyre there in the mow of hay
 I hear them saying Hes out of the way
 Hark how theyre kissing and whispering   
 Closer I creep    I crouch    I spring   

 _He wakes_

 Ugh What a horrible dream Ive had
 And it isnt real    Im glad Im glad
 Marie is good and Marie is true   
 But now I know what its best to do
 Ill sell the farm and Ill seek my kind
 Ill live apart with my fellowblind
 And well eat and drink and well laugh and joke
 And well talk of our battles and smoke and smoke
 And brushes of bristle well make for sale
 While one of us reads a book of Braille
 And there will be music and dancing too
 And well seek to fashion our life anew
 And well walk the highways hand in hand
 The Brotherhood of the Sightless Band
 Till the years at last shall bring respite
 And our night is lost in the Greater Night




The Legless Man



 _The Dark Side_

 _My mind goes back to Fumin Wood and how we stuck it out
 Eight days of hunger thirst and cold mowed down by steel and flame
 Waistdeep in mud and mad with woe with dead men all about
 We fought like fiends and waited for relief that never came
 Eight days and nights they rolled on us in battlefrenzied mass
 Debout les morts We hurled them back By God they did not pass_

 They pinned two medals on my chest a yellow and a brown
 And lovely ladies made me blush such pretty words they said
 I felt a cheerful man almost until my eyes went down
 And there I saw the blanketshow they sagged upon my bed
 And then again I drank the cup of sorrow to the dregs
 Oh they can keep their medals if they give me back my legs

 I think of how I used to run and leap and kick the ball
 And ride and dance and climb the hills and frolic in the sea
 And all the thousand things that now Ill never do at all   
 _Mon Dieu_ theres nothing left in life it often seems to me
 And as the nurses lift me up and strap me in my chair
 If they would chloroform me off I feel I wouldnt care

 Ah yes were heroes all todaythey point to us with pride
 Today their hearts go out to us the tears are in their eyes
 But wait a bit tomorrow they will blindly look aside
 No more theyll talk of what they owe the dues of sacrifice
 One hates to be reminded of an everlasting debt
 Its all in human nature Ah the world will soon forget

 _My mind goes back to where I lay woundrotted on the plain
 And ate the muddy mangold roots and drank the drops of dew
 And dragged myself for miles and miles when every move was pain
 And over me the carrioncrows were retching as they flew
 Oh ere I closed my eyes and stuck my rifle in the air
 I wish that those who picked me up had passed and left me there_




 _The Bright Side_

 Oh one gets used to everything
 I hum a merry song
 And up the street and round the square
 I wheel my chair along
 For look you how my chest is sound
 And how my arms are strong

 Oh one gets used to anything
 Its awkward at the first
 And jolting oer the cobbles gives
 A man a grievous thirst
 But of all ills that one must bear
 Thats surely not the worst

 For theres the cafe open wide
 And there they set me up
 And there I smoke my _caporal_
 Above my cider cup
 And play _manille_ a while before
 I hurry home to sup

 At home the wife is waiting me
 With smiles and pigeonpie
 And little ZiZi claps her hands
 With laughter loud and high
 And if theres cause to growl I fail
 To see the reason why

 And all the evening by the lamp
 I read some tale of crime
 Or play my old accordion
 With Marie keeping time
 Until we hear the hour of ten
 From out the steeple chime

 Then in the morning bright and soon
 No moment do I lose
 Within my little cobblers shop
 To gain the silver _sous_
 Good luck one has no need of legs
 To make a pair of shoes

 And every Sundayoh its then
 I am the happy man
 They wheel me to the riverside
 And there with rod and can
 I sit and fish and catch a dish
 Of _goujons_ for the pan

 Aye one gets used to everything
 And doesnt seem to mind
 Maybe Im happier than most
 Of my twolegged kind
 For look you at the darkest cloud
 Lo how its silverlined




The Faceless Man



 _Im dead_
 Officially Im dead Their hope is past
 How long I stood as missing Now at last
 Im dead
 Look in my faceno likeness can you see
 No tiny trace of him they knew as me
 How terrible the change
 Even my eyes are strange
 So keyed are they to pain
 That if I chanced to meet
 My mother in the street
 Shed look at me in vain

 When she got home I think shed say
 I saw the saddest sight today
 A _poilu_ with no face at all
 Far better in the fight to fall
 Than go through life like that I think
 Poor fellow how he made me shrink
 No face Just eyes that seemed to stare
 At me with anguish and despair
 This ghastly war Im almost cheered
 To think my son who disappeared
 My boy so handsome and so gay
 Might have come home like him today

 Im dead I think its better to be dead
 When little children look at you with dread
 And when you know your coming home again
 Will only give the ones who love you pain
 Ah who can help but shrink One cannot blame
 They see the hideous husk not not the flame
 Of sacrifice and love that burns within
 While souls of satyrs riddled through with sin
 Have bodies fair and excellent to see
 _Mon Dieu_ how different we all would be
 If this our flesh was ordained to express
 Our spirits beauty or its ugliness

 Oh you who look at me with fear today
 And shrink despite yourselves and turn away
 It was for you I suffered woe accurst
 For you I braved red battle at its worst
 For you I fought and bled and maimed and slew
 For you for you
 For you I faced hellfury and despair
 The reeking horror of it all I knew
 I flung myself into the furnace there
 I faced the flame that scorched me with its glare
 I drank unto the dregs the devils brew
 Look at me nowfor _you_ and _you_ and _you_   

     

 Im thinking of the time we said goodby
 We took our dinner in Duvals that night
 Just little Jacqueline Lucette and I
 We tried our very utmost to be bright
 We laughed And yet our eyes they werent gay
 I sought all kinds of cheering things to say
 Dont grieve I told them Soon the time will pass
 My next permission will come quickly round
 Well all meet at the Gare du Montparnasse
 Three times Ive come already safe and sound
 But oh I thought its harder every time
 After a home that seems like Paradise
 To go back to the vermin and the slime
 The weariness the want the sacrifice
 Pray God I said the war may soon be done
 But no oh never never till weve won

 Then to the station quietly we walked
 I had my rifle and my haversack
 My heavy boots my blankets on my back
 And though it hurt us cheerfully we talked
 We chatted bravely at the platform gate
 I watched the clock My train must go at eight
 One minute to the hour    we kissed goodby
 Then oh they both broke down with piteous cry
 I went    Their way was barred they could not pass
 I looked back as the train began to start
 Once more I ran with anguish at my heart
 And through the bars I kissed my little lass   

 Three years have gone theyve waited day by day
 I never came I did not even write
 For when I saw my face was such a sight
 I thought that I had better    stay away
 And so I took the name of one who died
 A friendless friend who perished by my side
 In Prussian prison camps three years of hell
 I kept my secret oh I kept it well
 And now Im free but none shall ever know
 They think I died out there    its better so

 Today I passed my wife in widows weeds
 I brushed her arm She did not even look
 So white so pinched her face my heart still bleeds
 And at the touch of her oh how I shook
 And then last night I passed the window where
 They sat together I could see them clear
 The lamplight softly gleaming on their hair
 And all the room so full of cozy cheer
 My wife was sewing while my daughter read
 I even saw my portrait on the wall
 I wanted to rush in to tell them all
 And then I cursed myself Youre dead youre dead
 God how I watched them from the darkness there
 Clutching the dripping branches of a tree
 Peering as close as ever I might dare
 And sobbing sobbing oh so bitterly

 But no its folly and I mustnt stay
 Tomorrow I am going far away
 Ill find a ship and sail before the mast
 In some wild land Ill bury all the past
 Ill live on lonely shores and there forget
 Or tell myself that there has never been
 The gay and tender courage of Lucette
 The little loving arms of Jacqueline

 A man lonely upon a lonely isle
 Sometimes Ill look towards the North and smile
 To think theyre happy and they both believe
 I died for France and that I lie at rest
 And for my glorys sake theyve ceased to grieve
 And hold my memory sacred Ah thats best
 And in that thought Ill find my joy and peace
 As there alone I wait the Last Release





LEnvoi



 _Weve finished up the filthy war
 Weve won what we were fighting for   
 Or have we I dont know
 But anyway I have my wish
 Im back upon the old Boul Mich
 And how my hearts aglow
 Though in my coats an empty sleeve
 Ah do not think I ever grieve
 The pension for it I believe
 Will keep me on the go

 So Ill be free to write and write
 And give my soul to sheer delight
 Till joy is almost pain
 To stand aloof and watch the throng
 And worship youth and sing my song
 Of faith and hope again
 To seek for beauty everywhere
 To make each day a living prayer
 That life may not be vain

 To sing of things that comfort me
 The joy in mothereyes the glee
 Of little ones at play
 The blessed gentleness of trees
 Of old men dreaming at their ease
 Soft afternoons away
 Of violets and swallows wings
 Of wondrous ordinary things
 In words of every day

 To rhyme of rich and rainy nights
 When like a legion leap the lights
 And take the town with gold
 Of taverns quaint where poets dream
 Of cafes gaudily agleam
 And vice thats overbold
 Of crystal shimmer silver sheen
 Of soft and soothing nicotine
 Of wine thats rich and old

 Of gutters chimneytops and stars
 Of applecarts and motorcars
 The sordid and sublime
 Of wealth and misery that meet
 In every great and little street
 Of glory and of grime
 Of all the living tide that flows
 From princes down to puppet shows
 Ill make my humble rhyme

 So if you like the sort of thing
 Of which I also like to sing
 Just give my stuff a look
 And if you dont no harm is done

 In writing it Ive had my fun
 Good luck to you and every one
 And so
 Here ends my book_





Notes


While Stephen Poore is a fictional character he is real enough in
some ways Robert Service was himself in the Ambulance Corps and his
descriptions of Bohemia of this day and the emergence of war bear
striking similarities to the case of Alan Seegerand no doubt a
great many other war poets of the Great War It has been said that
every section of the trench had its own poet and many of them such as
Wilfred Owen Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves became famous for
their poetry of the war This book in its way presents a striking
picture of the effect of the war on Europethough it stops short of
showing just how great the effect was

I hope you enjoyed Services references to himself in the text as
Sourdough Servicebut they should not be taken too seriously

The names of two great Russian composers Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky
were originally spelled Tschaikowsky and Stravinski in The Philistine
and the Bohemian These composers were contemporaries of the author
and due to the difficulty of transliterating from the Russian Cyrillic
alphabet to the Roman Alphabet hampered by different uses of Roman
letters in various European languages it is not until fairly recently
that the current spellings have taken holdand their grip is not yet
firm A couple of other names were given incorrectly in the same poem
Mallarme was spelled with one L and E BurneJones a preRaphaelite
painter and associate of Rossetti was given as F B Jones These
names are corrected in this text as is Synge given as Singe in the
original LEscargot DOr

The Introduction to Alan Seegers Poems written by William Archer is
included in the Project Gutenberg edition of Seegers Poems if you feel
inclined to compare and contrast the cases

If you enjoy Services style of poetry I would like to recommend to you
the works of A B Banjo Paterson an Australian poet author of The
Man from Snowy River and Waltzing Matilda His style and his sense of
humour are similar Several of his works are available from Project
Gutenberg

Alan R Light Monroe North Carolina June 1997

to the Yukon Territory in 1904 as a bank clerk and became famous for
his poems about this region which are mostly in his first two books of
poetry He wrote quite a bit of prose as well and worked as a reporter
for some time but those writings are not nearly as well known as his
poems He travelled around the world quite a bit and narrowly escaped

with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
