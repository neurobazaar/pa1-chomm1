Chapter I The beginning of things


They were not railway children to begin with I dont suppose they had
ever thought about railways except as a means of getting to Maskelyne
and Cooks the Pantomime Zoological Gardens and Madame Tussauds
They were just ordinary suburban children and they lived with their
Father and Mother in an ordinary redbrickfronted villa with coloured
glass in the front door a tiled passage that was called a hall a
bathroom with hot and cold water electric bells French windows and
a good deal of white paint and every modern convenience as the
houseagents say

There were three of them Roberta was the eldest Of course Mothers
never have favourites but if their Mother HAD had a favourite it might
have been Roberta Next came Peter who wished to be an Engineer when he
grew up and the youngest was Phyllis who meant extremely well

Mother did not spend all her time in paying dull calls to dull ladies
and sitting dully at home waiting for dull ladies to pay calls to her
She was almost always there ready to play with the children and read
to them and help them to do their homelessons Besides this she used
to write stories for them while they were at school and read them
aloud after tea and she always made up funny pieces of poetry for their
birthdays and for other great occasions such as the christening of the
new kittens or the refurnishing of the dolls house or the time when
they were getting over the mumps

These three lucky children always had everything they needed pretty
clothes good fires a lovely nursery with heaps of toys and a Mother
Goose wallpaper They had a kind and merry nursemaid and a dog who was
called James and who was their very own They also had a Father who was
just perfectnever cross never unjust and always ready for a gameat
least if at any time he was NOT ready he always had an excellent
reason for it and explained the reason to the children so interestingly
and funnily that they felt sure he couldnt help himself

You will think that they ought to have been very happy And so they
were but they did not know HOW happy till the pretty life in the Red
Villa was over and done with and they had to live a very different life
indeed

The dreadful change came quite suddenly

Peter had a birthdayhis tenth Among his other presents was a model
engine more perfect than you could ever have dreamed of The other
presents were full of charm but the Engine was fuller of charm than any
of the others were

Its charm lasted in its full perfection for exactly three days Then
owing either to Peters inexperience or Phylliss good intentions which
had been rather pressing or to some other cause the Engine suddenly
went off with a bang James was so frightened that he went out and did
not come back all day All the Noahs Ark people who were in the tender
were broken to bits but nothing else was hurt except the poor little
engine and the feelings of Peter The others said he cried over itbut
of course boys of ten do not cry however terrible the tragedies may be
which darken their lot He said that his eyes were red because he had a
cold This turned out to be true though Peter did not know it was when
he said it the next day he had to go to bed and stay there Mother
began to be afraid that he might be sickening for measles when suddenly
he sat up in bed and said

I hate gruelI hate barley waterI hate bread and milk I want to get
up and have something REAL to eat

What would you like Mother asked

A pigeonpie said Peter eagerly a large pigeonpie A very large
one

So Mother asked the Cook to make a large pigeonpie The pie was made
And when the pie was made it was cooked And when it was cooked Peter
ate some of it After that his cold was better Mother made a piece of
poetry to amuse him while the pie was being made It began by saying
what an unfortunate but worthy boy Peter was then it went on

 He had an engine that he loved
 With all his heart and soul
 And if he had a wish on earth
 It was to keep it whole

 One daymy friends prepare your minds
 Im coming to the worst
 Quite suddenly a screw went mad
 And then the boiler burst

 With gloomy face he picked it up
 And took it to his Mother
 Though even he could not suppose
 That she could make another

 For those who perished on the line
 He did not seem to care
 His engine being more to him
 Than all the people there

 And now you see the reason why
 Our Peter has been ill
 He soothes his soul with pigeonpie
 His gnawing grief to kill

 He wraps himself in blankets warm
 And sleeps in bed till late
 Determined thus to overcome
 His miserable fate

 And if his eyes are rather red
 His cold must just excuse it
 Offer him pie you may be sure
 He never will refuse it

Father had been away in the country for three or four days All Peters
hopes for the curing of his afflicted Engine were now fixed on his
Father for Father was most wonderfully clever with his fingers He
could mend all sorts of things He had often acted as veterinary surgeon
to the wooden rockinghorse once he had saved its life when all human
aid was despaired of and the poor creature was given up for lost and
even the carpenter said he didnt see his way to do anything And it was
Father who mended the dolls cradle when no one else could and with a
little glue and some bits of wood and a penknife made all the Noahs
Ark beasts as strong on their pins as ever they were if not stronger

Peter with heroic unselfishness did not say anything about his Engine
till after Father had had his dinner and his afterdinner cigar The
unselfishness was Mothers ideabut it was Peter who carried it out
And needed a good deal of patience too

At last Mother said to Father Now dear if youre quite rested and
quite comfy we want to tell you about the great railway accident and
ask your advice

All right said Father fire away

So then Peter told the sad tale and fetched what was left of the
Engine

Hum said Father when he had looked the Engine over very carefully

The children held their breaths

Is there NO hope said Peter in a low unsteady voice

Hope Rather Tons of it said Father cheerfully but itll want
something besides hopea bit of brazing say or some solder and a new
valve I think wed better keep it for a rainy day In other words Ill
give up Saturday afternoon to it and you shall all help me

CAN girls help to mend engines Peter asked doubtfully

Of course they can Girls are just as clever as boys and dont you
forget it How would you like to be an enginedriver Phil

My face would be always dirty wouldnt it said Phyllis in
unenthusiastic tones and I expect I should break something

I should just love it said Robertado you think I could when Im
grown up Daddy Or even a stoker

You mean a fireman said Daddy pulling and twisting at the engine
Well if you still wish it when youre grown up well see about
making you a firewoman I remember when I was a boy

Just then there was a knock at the front door

Who on earth said Father An Englishmans house is his castle of
course but I do wish they built semidetached villas with moats and
drawbridges

Ruthshe was the parlourmaid and had red haircame in and said that
two gentlemen wanted to see the master

Ive shown them into the Library Sir said she

I expect its the subscription to the Vicars testimonial said
Mother or else its the choir holiday fund Get rid of them quickly
dear It does break up an evening so and its nearly the childrens
bedtime

But Father did not seem to be able to get rid of the gentlemen at all
quickly

I wish we HAD got a moat and drawbridge said Roberta then when we
didnt want people we could just pull up the drawbridge and no one else
could get in I expect Father will have forgotten about when he was a
boy if they stay much longer

Mother tried to make the time pass by telling them a new fairy story
about a Princess with green eyes but it was difficult because they
could hear the voices of Father and the gentlemen in the Library and
Fathers voice sounded louder and different to the voice he generally
used to people who came about testimonials and holiday funds

Then the Library bell rang and everyone heaved a breath of relief

Theyre going now said Phyllis hes rung to have them shown out

But instead of showing anybody out Ruth showed herself in and she
looked queer the children thought

Pleasem she said the Master wants you to just step into the study
He looks like the dead mum I think hes had bad news Youd best
prepare yourself for the worst mpraps its a death in the family or
a bank busted or

Thatll do Ruth said Mother gently you can go

Then Mother went into the Library There was more talking Then the bell
rang again and Ruth fetched a cab The children heard boots go out and
down the steps The cab drove away and the front door shut Then Mother
came in Her dear face was as white as her lace collar and her eyes
looked very big and shining Her mouth looked like just a line of pale
redher lips were thin and not their proper shape at all

Its bedtime she said Ruth will put you to bed

But you promised we should sit up late tonight because Fathers come
home said Phyllis

Fathers been called awayon business said Mother Come darlings
go at once

They kissed her and went Roberta lingered to give Mother an extra hug
and to whisper

It wasnt bad news Mammy was it Is anyone deador

Nobodys deadno said Mother and she almost seemed to push Roberta
away I cant tell you anything tonight my pet Go dear go NOW

So Roberta went

Ruth brushed the girls hair and helped them to undress Mother almost
always did this herself When she had turned down the gas and left them
she found Peter still dressed waiting on the stairs

I say Ruth whats up he asked

Dont ask me no questions and I wont tell you no lies the redheaded
Ruth replied Youll know soon enough

Late that night Mother came up and kissed all three children as they
lay asleep But Roberta was the only one whom the kiss woke and she lay
mouseystill and said nothing

If Mother doesnt want us to know shes been crying she said to
herself as she heard through the dark the catching of her Mothers
breath we WONT know it Thats all

When they came down to breakfast the next morning Mother had already
gone out

To London Ruth said and left them to their breakfast

Theres something awful the matter said Peter breaking his egg
Ruth told me last night we should know soon enough

Did you ASK her said Roberta with scorn

Yes I did said Peter angrily If you could go to bed without
caring whether Mother was worried or not I couldnt So there

I dont think we ought to ask the servants things Mother doesnt tell
us said Roberta

Thats right Miss Goodygoody said Peter preach away

IM not goody said Phyllis but I think Bobbies right this time

Of course She always is In her own opinion said Peter

Oh DONT cried Roberta putting down her eggspoon dont lets be
horrid to each other Im sure some dire calamity is happening Dont
lets make it worse

Who began I should like to know said Peter

Roberta made an effort and answered

I did I suppose but

Well then said Peter triumphantly But before he went to school he
thumped his sister between the shoulders and told her to cheer up

The children came home to one oclock dinner but Mother was not there
And she was not there at teatime

It was nearly seven before she came in looking so ill and tired that
the children felt they could not ask her any questions She sank into an
armchair Phyllis took the long pins out of her hat while Roberta took
off her gloves and Peter unfastened her walkingshoes and fetched her
soft velvety slippers for her

When she had had a cup of tea and Roberta had put eaudeCologne on her
poor head that ached Mother said

Now my darlings I want to tell you something Those men last night
did bring very bad news and Father will be away for some time I am
very worried about it and I want you all to help me and not to make
things harder for me

As if we would said Roberta holding Mothers hand against her face

You can help me very much said Mother by being good and happy
and not quarrelling when Im awayRoberta and Peter exchanged guilty
glancesfor I shall have to be away a good deal

We wont quarrel Indeed we wont said everybody And meant it too

Then Mother went on I want you not to ask me any questions about
this trouble and not to ask anybody else any questions

Peter cringed and shuffled his boots on the carpet

Youll promise this too wont you said Mother

I did ask Ruth said Peter suddenly Im very sorry but I did

And what did she say

She said I should know soon enough

It isnt necessary for you to know anything about it said Mother
its about business and you never do understand business do you

No said Roberta is it something to do with Government For Father
was in a Government Office

Yes said Mother Now its bedtime my darlings And dont YOU
worry Itll all come right in the end

Then dont YOU worry either Mother said Phyllis and well all be
as good as gold

Mother sighed and kissed them

Well begin being good the first thing tomorrow morning said Peter
as they went upstairs

Why not NOW said Roberta

Theres nothing to be good ABOUT now silly said Peter

We might begin to try to FEEL good said Phyllis and not call
names

Whos calling names said Peter Bobbie knows right enough that when
I say silly its just the same as if I said Bobbie

WELL said Roberta

No I dont mean what you mean I mean its just awhat is it Father
calls ita germ of endearment Good night

The girls folded up their clothes with more than usual neatnesswhich
was the only way of being good that they could think of

I say said Phyllis smoothing out her pinafore you used to say
it was so dullnothing happening like in books Now something HAS
happened

I never wanted things to happen to make Mother unhappy said Roberta
Everythings perfectly horrid

Everything continued to be perfectly horrid for some weeks

Mother was nearly always out Meals were dull and dirty The
betweenmaid was sent away and Aunt Emma came on a visit Aunt Emma was
much older than Mother She was going abroad to be a governess She
was very busy getting her clothes ready and they were very ugly dingy
clothes and she had them always littering about and the sewingmachine
seemed to whiron and on all day and most of the night Aunt Emma
believed in keeping children in their proper places And they more than
returned the compliment Their idea of Aunt Emmas proper place was
anywhere where they were not So they saw very little of her They
preferred the company of the servants who were more amusing Cook
if in a good temper could sing comic songs and the housemaid if she
happened not to be offended with you could imitate a hen that has laid
an egg a bottle of champagne being opened and could mew like two cats
fighting The servants never told the children what the bad news was
that the gentlemen had brought to Father But they kept hinting
that they could tell a great deal if they choseand this was not
comfortable

One day when Peter had made a booby trap over the bathroom door and
it had acted beautifully as Ruth passed through that redhaired
parlourmaid caught him and boxed his ears

Youll come to a bad end she said furiously you nasty little limb
you If you dont mend your ways youll go where your precious Fathers
gone so I tell you straight

Roberta repeated this to her Mother and next day Ruth was sent away

Then came the time when Mother came home and went to bed and stayed
there two days and the Doctor came and the children crept wretchedly
about the house and wondered if the world was coming to an end

Mother came down one morning to breakfast very pale and with lines
on her face that used not to be there And she smiled as well as she
could and said

Now my pets everything is settled Were going to leave this house
and go and live in the country Such a ducky dear little white house I
know youll love it

A whirling week of packing followednot just packing clothes like when
you go to the seaside but packing chairs and tables covering their
tops with sacking and their legs with straw

All sorts of things were packed that you dont pack when you go to
the seaside Crockery blankets candlesticks carpets bedsteads
saucepans and even fenders and fireirons

The house was like a furniture warehouse I think the children enjoyed
it very much Mother was very busy but not too busy now to talk to
them and read to them and even to make a bit of poetry for Phyllis to
cheer her up when she fell down with a screwdriver and ran it into her
hand

Arent you going to pack this Mother Roberta asked pointing to the
beautiful cabinet inlaid with red turtleshell and brass

We cant take everything said Mother

But we seem to be taking all the ugly things said Roberta

Were taking the useful ones said Mother weve got to play at being
Poor for a bit my chickabiddy

When all the ugly useful things had been packed up and taken away in a
van by men in greenbaize aprons the two girls and Mother and Aunt Emma
slept in the two spare rooms where the furniture was all pretty All
their beds had gone A bed was made up for Peter on the drawingroom
sofa

I say this is larks he said wriggling joyously as Mother tucked
him up I do like moving I wish we moved once a month

Mother laughed

I dont she said Good night Peterkin

As she turned away Roberta saw her face She never forgot it

Oh Mother she whispered all to herself as she got into bed how
brave you are How I love you Fancy being brave enough to laugh when
youre feeling like THAT

Next day boxes were filled and boxes and more boxes and then late in
the afternoon a cab came to take them to the station

Aunt Emma saw them off They felt that THEY were seeing HER off and
they were glad of it

But oh those poor little foreign children that shes going to
governess whispered Phyllis I wouldnt be them for anything

At first they enjoyed looking out of the window but when it grew dusk
they grew sleepier and sleepier and no one knew how long they had been
in the train when they were roused by Mothers shaking them gently and
saying

Wake up dears Were there

They woke up cold and melancholy and stood shivering on the draughty
platform while the baggage was taken out of the train Then the engine
puffing and blowing set to work again and dragged the train away The
children watched the taillights of the guards van disappear into the
darkness

This was the first train the children saw on that railway which was in
time to become so very dear to them They did not guess then how they
would grow to love the railway and how soon it would become the centre
of their new life nor what wonders and changes it would bring to them
They only shivered and sneezed and hoped the walk to the new house would
not be long Peters nose was colder than he ever remembered it to have
been before Robertas hat was crooked and the elastic seemed tighter
than usual Phylliss shoelaces had come undone

Come said Mother weve got to walk There arent any cabs here

The walk was dark and muddy The children stumbled a little on the rough
road and once Phyllis absently fell into a puddle and was picked up
damp and unhappy There were no gaslamps on the road and the road was
uphill The cart went at a foots pace and they followed the gritty
crunch of its wheels As their eyes got used to the darkness they could
see the mound of boxes swaying dimly in front of them

A long gate had to be opened for the cart to pass through and after
that the road seemed to go across fieldsand now it went down hill
Presently a great dark lumpish thing showed over to the right

Theres the house said Mother I wonder why shes shut the
shutters

Whos SHE asked Roberta

The woman I engaged to clean the place and put the furniture straight
and get supper

There was a low wall and trees inside

Thats the garden said Mother

It looks more like a drippingpan full of black cabbages said Peter

The cart went on along by the garden wall and round to the back of the
house and here it clattered into a cobblestoned yard and stopped at
the back door

There was no light in any of the windows

Everyone hammered at the door but no one came

The man who drove the cart said he expected Mrs Viney had gone home

You see your train was that late said he

But shes got the key said Mother What are we to do

Oh shell have left that under the doorstep said the cart man
folks do hereabouts He took the lantern off his cart and stooped

Ay here it is right enough he said

He unlocked the door and went in and set his lantern on the table

Got eer a candle said he

I dont know where anything is Mother spoke rather less cheerfully
than usual

He struck a match There was a candle on the table and he lighted it
By its thin little glimmer the children saw a large bare kitchen with
a stone floor There were no curtains no hearthrug The kitchen
table from home stood in the middle of the room The chairs were in one
corner and the pots pans brooms and crockery in another There was
no fire and the black grate showed cold dead ashes

As the cart man turned to go out after he had brought in the boxes
there was a rustling scampering sound that seemed to come from inside
the walls of the house

Oh whats that cried the girls

Its only the rats said the cart man And he went away and shut the
door and the sudden draught of it blew out the candle

Oh dear said Phyllis I wish we hadnt come and she knocked a
chair over

ONLY the rats said Peter in the dark



Chapter II Peters coalmine


What fun said Mother in the dark feeling for the matches on the
table How frightened the poor mice wereI dont believe they were
rats at all

She struck a match and relighted the candle and everyone looked at each
other by its winky blinky light

Well she said youve often wanted something to happen and now it
has This is quite an adventure isnt it I told Mrs Viney to get us
some bread and butter and meat and things and to have supper ready I
suppose shes laid it in the diningroom So lets go and see

The diningroom opened out of the kitchen It looked much darker than
the kitchen when they went in with the one candle Because the kitchen
was whitewashed but the diningroom was dark wood from floor to
ceiling and across the ceiling there were heavy black beams There was
a muddled maze of dusty furniturethe breakfastroom furniture from
the old home where they had lived all their lives It seemed a very long
time ago and a very long way off

There was the table certainly and there were chairs but there was no
supper

Lets look in the other rooms said Mother and they looked And in
each room was the same kind of blundering halfarrangement of furniture
and fireirons and crockery and all sorts of odd things on the floor
but there was nothing to eat even in the pantry there were only a rusty
caketin and a broken plate with whitening mixed in it

What a horrid old woman said Mother shes just walked off with the
money and not got us anything to eat at all

Then shant we have any supper at all asked Phyllis dismayed
stepping back on to a soapdish that cracked responsively

Oh yes said Mother only itll mean unpacking one of those big
cases that we put in the cellar Phil do mind where youre walking to
theres a dear Peter hold the light

The cellar door opened out of the kitchen There were five wooden steps
leading down It wasnt a proper cellar at all the children thought
because its ceiling went up as high as the kitchens A baconrack hung
under its ceiling There was wood in it and coal Also the big cases

Peter held the candle all on one side while Mother tried to open the
great packingcase It was very securely nailed down

Wheres the hammer asked Peter

Thats just it said Mother Im afraid its inside the box But
theres a coalshoveland theres the kitchen poker

And with these she tried to get the case open

Let me do it said Peter thinking he could do it better himself
Everyone thinks this when he sees another person stirring a fire or
opening a box or untying a knot in a bit of string

Youll hurt your hands Mammy said Roberta let me

I wish Father was here said Phyllis hed get it open in two shakes
What are you kicking me for Bobbie

I wasnt said Roberta

Just then the first of the long nails in the packingcase began to come
out with a scrunch Then a lath was raised and then another till all
four stood up with the long nails in them shining fiercely like iron
teeth in the candlelight

Hooray said Mother here are some candlesthe very first thing You
girls go and light them Youll find some saucers and things Just drop
a little candlegrease in the saucer and stick the candle upright in
it

How many shall we light

As many as ever you like said Mother gaily The great thing is
to be cheerful Nobody can be cheerful in the dark except owls and
dormice

So the girls lighted candles The head of the first match flew off and
stuck to Phylliss finger but as Roberta said it was only a little
burn and she might have had to be a Roman martyr and be burned whole if
she had happened to live in the days when those things were fashionable

Then when the diningroom was lighted by fourteen candles Roberta
fetched coal and wood and lighted a fire

Its very cold for May she said feeling what a grownup thing it was
to say

The firelight and the candlelight made the diningroom look very
different for now you could see that the dark walls were of wood
carved here and there into little wreaths and loops

The girls hastily tidied the room which meant putting the chairs
against the wall and piling all the odds and ends into a corner and
partly hiding them with the big leather armchair that Father used to
sit in after dinner

Bravo cried Mother coming in with a tray full of things This is
something like Ill just get a tablecloth and then

The tablecloth was in a box with a proper lock that was opened with a
key and not with a shovel and when the cloth was spread on the table a
real feast was laid out on it

Everyone was very very tired but everyone cheered up at the sight of
the funny and delightful supper There were biscuits the Marie and the
plain kind sardines preserved ginger cooking raisins and candied
peel and marmalade

What a good thing Aunt Emma packed up all the odds and ends out of the
Store cupboard said Mother Now Phil DONT put the marmalade spoon
in among the sardines

No I wont Mother said Phyllis and put it down among the Marie
biscuits

Lets drink Aunt Emmas health said Roberta suddenly what should
we have done if she hadnt packed up these things Heres to Aunt Emma

And the toast was drunk in ginger wine and water out of
willowpatterned teacups because the glasses couldnt be found

They all felt that they had been a little hard on Aunt Emma She wasnt
a nice cuddly person like Mother but after all it was she who had
thought of packing up the odds and ends of things to eat

It was Aunt Emma too who had aired all the sheets ready and the men
who had moved the furniture had put the bedsteads together so the beds
were soon made

Good night chickies said Mother Im sure there arent any rats
But Ill leave my door open and then if a mouse comes you need only
scream and Ill come and tell it exactly what I think of it

Then she went to her own room Roberta woke to hear the little
travelling clock chime two It sounded like a church clock ever so far
away she always thought And she heard too Mother still moving about
in her room

Next morning Roberta woke Phyllis by pulling her hair gently but quite
enough for her purpose

Wassermarrer asked Phyllis still almost wholly asleep

Wake up wake up said Roberta Were in the new housedont you
remember No servants or anything Lets get up and begin to be useful
Well just creep down mousequietly and have everything beautiful
before Mother gets up Ive woke Peter Hell be dressed as soon as we
are

So they dressed quietly and quickly Of course there was no water in
their room so when they got down they washed as much as they thought
was necessary under the spout of the pump in the yard One pumped and
the other washed It was splashy but interesting

Its much more fun than basin washing said Roberta How sparkly
the weeds are between the stones and the moss on the roofoh and the
flowers

The roof of the back kitchen sloped down quite low It was made
of thatch and it had moss on it and houseleeks and stonecrop and
wallflowers and even a clump of purple flagflowers at the far corner

This is far far far and away prettier than Edgecombe Villa said
Phyllis I wonder what the gardens like

We mustnt think of the garden yet said Roberta with earnest energy
Lets go in and begin to work

They lighted the fire and put the kettle on and they arranged the
crockery for breakfast they could not find all the right things but
a glass ashtray made an excellent saltcellar and a newish bakingtin
seemed as if it would do to put bread on if they had any

When there seemed to be nothing more that they could do they went out
again into the fresh bright morning

Well go into the garden now said Peter But somehow they couldnt
find the garden They went round the house and round the house The yard
occupied the back and across it were stables and outbuildings On the
other three sides the house stood simply in a field without a yard
of garden to divide it from the short smooth turf And yet they had
certainly seen the garden wall the night before

It was a hilly country Down below they could see the line of the
railway and the black yawning mouth of a tunnel The station was out of
sight There was a great bridge with tall arches running across one end
of the valley

Never mind the garden said Peter lets go down and look at the
railway There might be trains passing

We can see them from here said Roberta slowly lets sit down a
bit

So they all sat down on a great flat grey stone that had pushed itself
up out of the grass it was one of many that lay about on the hillside
and when Mother came out to look for them at eight oclock she found
them deeply asleep in a contented sunwarmed bunch

They had made an excellent fire and had set the kettle on it at about
halfpast five So that by eight the fire had been out for some time
the water had all boiled away and the bottom was burned out of the
kettle Also they had not thought of washing the crockery before they
set the table

But it doesnt matterthe cups and saucers I mean said Mother
Because Ive found another roomId quite forgotten there was one And
its magic And Ive boiled the water for tea in a saucepan

The forgotten room opened out of the kitchen In the agitation and half
darkness the night before its door had been mistaken for a cupboards
It was a little square room and on its table all nicely set out was a
joint of cold roast beef with bread butter cheese and a pie

Pie for breakfast cried Peter how perfectly ripping

It isnt pigeonpie said Mother its only apple Well this is the
supper we ought to have had last night And there was a note from Mrs
Viney Her soninlaw has broken his arm and she had to get home early
Shes coming this morning at ten

That was a wonderful breakfast It is unusual to begin the day with
cold apple pie but the children all said they would rather have it than
meat

You see its more like dinner than breakfast to us said Peter
passing his plate for more because we were up so early

The day passed in helping Mother to unpack and arrange things Six small
legs quite ached with running about while their owners carried clothes
and crockery and all sorts of things to their proper places It was not
till quite late in the afternoon that Mother said

There Thatll do for today Ill lie down for an hour so as to be as
fresh as a lark by suppertime

Then they all looked at each other Each of the three expressive
countenances expressed the same thought That thought was double
and consisted like the bits of information in the Childs Guide to
Knowledge of a question and an answer

Q Where shall we go

A To the railway

So to the railway they went and as soon as they started for the railway
they saw where the garden had hidden itself It was right behind the
stables and it had a high wall all round

Oh never mind about the garden now cried Peter Mother told me
this morning where it was Itll keep till tomorrow Lets get to the
railway

The way to the railway was all down hill over smooth short turf with
here and there furze bushes and grey and yellow rocks sticking out like
candied peel from the top of a cake

The way ended in a steep run and a wooden fenceand there was the
railway with the shining metals and the telegraph wires and posts and
signals

They all climbed on to the top of the fence and then suddenly there was
a rumbling sound that made them look along the line to the right where
the dark mouth of a tunnel opened itself in the face of a rocky cliff
next moment a train had rushed out of the tunnel with a shriek and
a snort and had slid noisily past them They felt the rush of its
passing and the pebbles on the line jumped and rattled under it as it
went by

Oh said Roberta drawing a long breath it was like a great dragon
tearing by Did you feel it fan us with its hot wings

I suppose a dragons lair might look very like that tunnel from the
outside said Phyllis

But Peter said

I never thought we should ever get as near to a train as this Its the
most ripping sport

Better than toyengines isnt it said Roberta

I am tired of calling Roberta by her name I dont see why I should
No one else did Everyone else called her Bobbie and I dont see why I
shouldnt

I dont know its different said Peter It seems so odd to see ALL
of a train Its awfully tall isnt it

Weve always seen them cut in half by platforms said Phyllis

I wonder if that train was going to London Bobbie said Londons
where Father is

Lets go down to the station and find out said Peter

So they went

They walked along the edge of the line and heard the telegraph wires
humming over their heads When you are in the train it seems such a
little way between post and post and one after another the posts seem
to catch up the wires almost more quickly than you can count them But
when you have to walk the posts seem few and far between

But the children got to the station at last

Never before had any of them been at a station except for the purpose
of catching trainsor perhaps waiting for themand always with
grownups in attendance grownups who were not themselves interested in
stations except as places from which they wished to get away

Never before had they passed close enough to a signalbox to be able to
notice the wires and to hear the mysterious ping ping followed by
the strong firm clicking of machinery

The very sleepers on which the rails lay were a delightful path to
travel byjust far enough apart to serve as the steppingstones in a
game of foaming torrents hastily organised by Bobbie

Then to arrive at the station not through the booking office but in
a freebooting sort of way by the sloping end of the platform This in
itself was joy

Joy too it was to peep into the porters room where the lamps are
and the Railway almanac on the wall and one porter half asleep behind a
paper

There were a great many crossing lines at the station some of them just
ran into a yard and stopped short as though they were tired of business
and meant to retire for good Trucks stood on the rails here and on one
side was a great heap of coalnot a loose heap such as you see in your
coal cellar but a sort of solid building of coals with large square
blocks of coal outside used just as though they were bricks and built
up till the heap looked like the picture of the Cities of the Plain in
Bible Stories for Infants There was a line of whitewash near the top
of the coaly wall

When presently the Porter lounged out of his room at the twicerepeated
tingling thrill of a gong over the station door Peter said How do you
do in his best manner and hastened to ask what the white mark was on
the coal for

To mark how much coal there be said the Porter so as well know if
anyone nicks it So dont you go off with none in your pockets young
gentleman

This seemed at the time but a merry jest and Peter felt at once that
the Porter was a friendly sort with no nonsense about him But later the
words came back to Peter with a new meaning

Have you ever gone into a farmhouse kitchen on a baking day and seen
the great crock of dough set by the fire to rise If you have and if
you were at that time still young enough to be interested in everything
you saw you will remember that you found yourself quite unable to
resist the temptation to poke your finger into the soft round of dough
that curved inside the pan like a giant mushroom And you will remember
that your finger made a dent in the dough and that slowly but quite
surely the dent disappeared and the dough looked quite the same as it
did before you touched it Unless of course your hand was extra dirty
in which case naturally there would be a little black mark

Well it was just like that with the sorrow the children had felt at
Fathers going away and at Mothers being so unhappy It made a deep
impression but the impression did not last long

They soon got used to being without Father though they did not forget
him and they got used to not going to school and to seeing very little
of Mother who was now almost all day shut up in her upstairs room
writing writing writing She used to come down at teatime and read
aloud the stories she had written They were lovely stories

The rocks and hills and valleys and trees the canal and above all the
railway were so new and so perfectly pleasing that the remembrance of
the old life in the villa grew to seem almost like a dream

Mother had told them more than once that they were quite poor now but
this did not seem to be anything but a way of speaking Grownup people
even Mothers often make remarks that dont seem to mean anything in
particular just for the sake of saying something seemingly There was
always enough to eat and they wore the same kind of nice clothes they
had always worn

But in June came three wet days the rain came down straight as lances
and it was very very cold Nobody could go out and everybody shivered
They all went up to the door of Mothers room and knocked

Well what is it asked Mother from inside

Mother said Bobbie maynt I light a fire I do know how

And Mother said No my duckylove We mustnt have fires in Junecoal
is so dear If youre cold go and have a good romp in the attic
Thatll warm you

But Mother it only takes such a very little coal to make a fire

Its more than we can afford chickenylove said Mother cheerfully
Now run away theres darlingsIm madly busy

Mothers always busy now said Phyllis in a whisper to Peter Peter
did not answer He shrugged his shoulders He was thinking

Thought however could not long keep itself from the suitable
furnishing of a bandits lair in the attic Peter was the bandit of
course Bobbie was his lieutenant his band of trusty robbers and in
due course the parent of Phyllis who was the captured maiden for whom
a magnificent ransomin horsebeanswas unhesitatingly paid

They all went down to tea flushed and joyous as any mountain brigands

But when Phyllis was going to add jam to her bread and butter Mother
said

Jam OR butter dearnot jam AND butter We cant afford that sort of
reckless luxury nowadays

Phyllis finished the slice of bread and butter in silence and followed
it up by bread and jam Peter mingled thought and weak tea

After tea they went back to the attic and he said to his sisters

I have an idea

Whats that they asked politely

I shant tell you was Peters unexpected rejoinder

Oh very well said Bobbie and Phil said Dont then

Girls said Peter are always so hasty tempered

I should like to know what boys are said Bobbie with fine disdain
I dont want to know about your silly ideas

Youll know some day said Peter keeping his own temper by what
looked exactly like a miracle if you hadnt been so keen on a row I
might have told you about it being only nobleheartedness that made me
not tell you my idea But now I shant tell you anything at all about
itso there

And it was indeed some time before he could be induced to say
anything and when he did it wasnt much He said

The only reason why I wont tell you my idea that Im going to do is
because it MAY be wrong and I dont want to drag you into it

Dont you do it if its wrong Peter said Bobbie let me do it But
Phyllis said

_I_ should like to do wrong if YOURE going to

No said Peter rather touched by this devotion its a forlorn hope
and Im going to lead it All I ask is that if Mother asks where I am
you wont blab

We havent got anything TO blab said Bobbie indignantly

Oh yes you have said Peter dropping horsebeans through his
fingers Ive trusted you to the death You know Im going to do a lone
adventureand some people might think it wrongI dont And if Mother
asks where I am say Im playing at mines

What sort of mines

You just say mines

You might tell US Pete

Well then COALmines But dont you let the word pass your lips on
pain of torture

You neednt threaten said Bobbie and I do think you might let us
help

If I find a coalmine you shall help cart the coal Peter
condescended to promise

Keep your secret if you like said Phyllis

Keep it if you CAN said Bobbie

Ill keep it right enough said Peter

Between tea and supper there is an interval even in the most greedily
regulated families At this time Mother was usually writing and Mrs
Viney had gone home

Two nights after the dawning of Peters idea he beckoned the girls
mysteriously at the twilight hour

Come hither with me he said and bring the Roman Chariot

The Roman Chariot was a very old perambulator that had spent years of
retirement in the loft over the coachhouse The children had oiled its
works till it glided noiseless as a pneumatic bicycle and answered to
the helm as it had probably done in its best days

Follow your dauntless leader said Peter and led the way down the
hill towards the station

Just above the station many rocks have pushed their heads out through
the turf as though they like the children were interested in the
railway

In a little hollow between three rocks lay a heap of dried brambles and
heather

Peter halted turned over the brushwood with a wellscarred boot and
said

Heres the first coal from the St Peters Mine Well take it home in
the chariot Punctuality and despatch All orders carefully attended to
Any shaped lump cut to suit regular customers

The chariot was packed full of coal And when it was packed it had to
be unpacked again because it was so heavy that it couldnt be got up the
hill by the three children not even when Peter harnessed himself to the
handle with his braces and firmly grasping his waistband in one hand
pulled while the girls pushed behind

Three journeys had to be made before the coal from Peters mine was
added to the heap of Mothers coal in the cellar

Afterwards Peter went out alone and came back very black and
mysterious

Ive been to my coalmine he said tomorrow evening well bring
home the black diamonds in the chariot

It was a week later that Mrs Viney remarked to Mother how well this
last lot of coal was holding out

The children hugged themselves and each other in complicated wriggles of
silent laughter as they listened on the stairs They had all forgotten
by now that there had ever been any doubt in Peters mind as to whether
coalmining was wrong

But there came a dreadful night when the Station Master put on a pair
of old sand shoes that he had worn at the seaside in his summer holiday
and crept out very quietly to the yard where the Sodom and Gomorrah heap
of coal was with the whitewashed line round it He crept out there and
he waited like a cat by a mousehole On the top of the heap something
small and dark was scrabbling and rattling furtively among the coal

The Station Master concealed himself in the shadow of a brakevan that
had a little tin chimney and was labelled

 G N and S R
 34576
 Return at once to
 White Heather Sidings

and in this concealment he lurked till the small thing on the top of
the heap ceased to scrabble and rattle came to the edge of the heap
cautiously let itself down and lifted something after it Then the arm
of the Station Master was raised the hand of the Station Master fell
on a collar and there was Peter firmly held by the jacket with an old
carpenters bag full of coal in his trembling clutch

So Ive caught you at last have I you young thief said the Station
Master

Im not a thief said Peter as firmly as he could Im a
coalminer

Tell that to the Marines said the Station Master

It would be just as true whoever I told it to said Peter

Youre right there said the man who held him Stow your jaw you
young rip and come along to the station

Oh no cried in the darkness an agonised voice that was not Peters

Not the POLICE station said another voice from the darkness

Not yet said the Station Master The Railway Station first Why
its a regular gang Any more of you

Only us said Bobbie and Phyllis coming out of the shadow of another
truck labelled Staveley Colliery and bearing on it the legend in white
chalk Wanted in No 1 Road

What do you mean by spying on a fellow like this said Peter angrily

Time someone did spy on you _I_ think said the Station Master Come
along to the station

Oh DONT said Bobbie Cant you decide NOW what youll do to us
Its our fault just as much as Peters We helped to carry the coal
awayand we knew where he got it

No you didnt said Peter

Yes we did said Bobbie We knew all the time We only pretended we
didnt just to humour you

Peters cup was full He had mined for coal he had struck coal he had
been caught and now he learned that his sisters had humoured him

Dont hold me he said I wont run away

The Station Master loosed Peters collar struck a match and looked at
them by its flickering light

Why said he youre the children from the Three Chimneys up yonder
So nicely dressed too Tell me now what made you do such a thing
Havent you ever been to church or learned your catechism or anything
not to know its wicked to steal He spoke much more gently now and
Peter said

I didnt think it was stealing I was almost sure it wasnt I thought
if I took it from the outside part of the heap perhaps it would be But
in the middle I thought I could fairly count it only mining Itll
take thousands of years for you to burn up all that coal and get to the
middle parts

Not quite But did you do it for a lark or what

Not much lark carting that beastly heavy stuff up the hill said
Peter indignantly

Then why did you The Station Masters voice was so much kinder now
that Peter replied

You know that wet day Well Mother said we were too poor to have a
fire We always had fires when it was cold at our other house and

DONT interrupted Bobbie in a whisper

Well said the Station Master rubbing his chin thoughtfully Ill
tell you what Ill do Ill look over it this once But you remember
young gentleman stealing is stealing and whats mine isnt yours
whether you call it mining or whether you dont Run along home

Do you mean you arent going to do anything to us Well you are a
brick said Peter with enthusiasm

Youre a dear said Bobbie

Youre a darling said Phyllis

Thats all right said the Station Master

And on this they parted

Dont speak to me said Peter as the three went up the hill Youre
spies and traitorsthats what you are

But the girls were too glad to have Peter between them safe and free
and on the way to Three Chimneys and not to the Police Station to mind
much what he said

We DID say it was us as much as you said Bobbie gently

Welland it wasnt

It would have come to the same thing in Courts with judges said
Phyllis Dont be snarky Peter It isnt our fault your secrets are so
jolly easy to find out She took his arm and he let her

Theres an awful lot of coal in the cellar anyhow he went on

Oh dont said Bobbie I dont think we ought to be glad about
THAT

I dont know said Peter plucking up a spirit Im not at all sure
even now that mining is a crime

But the girls were quite sure And they were also quite sure that he was
quite sure however little he cared to own it



Chapter III The old gentleman


After the adventure of Peters Coalmine it seemed well to the children
to keep away from the stationbut they did not they could not keep
away from the railway They had lived all their lives in a street where
cabs and omnibuses rumbled by at all hours and the carts of butchers
and bakers and candlestick makers I never saw a candlestickmakers
cart did you might occur at any moment Here in the deep silence of
the sleeping country the only things that went by were the trains They
seemed to be all that was left to link the children to the old life that
had once been theirs Straight down the hill in front of Three Chimneys
the daily passage of their six feet began to mark a path across the
crisp short turf They began to know the hours when certain trains
passed and they gave names to them The 915 up was called the Green
Dragon The 107 down was the Worm of Wantley The midnight town
express whose shrieking rush they sometimes woke from their dreams
to hear was the Fearsome Flybynight Peter got up once in chill
starshine and peeping at it through his curtains named it on the
spot

It was by the Green Dragon that the old gentleman travelled He was a
very nicelooking old gentleman and he looked as if he were nice
too which is not at all the same thing He had a freshcoloured
cleanshaven face and white hair and he wore rather oddshaped collars
and a tophat that wasnt exactly the same kind as other peoples Of
course the children didnt see all this at first In fact the first
thing they noticed about the old gentleman was his hand

It was one morning as they sat on the fence waiting for the Green
Dragon which was three and a quarter minutes late by Peters Waterbury
watch that he had had given him on his last birthday

The Green Dragons going where Father is said Phyllis if it were
a really real dragon we could stop it and ask it to take our love to
Father

Dragons dont carry peoples love said Peter theyd be above it

Yes they do if you tame them thoroughly first They fetch and carry
like pet spaniels said Phyllis and feed out of your hand I wonder
why Father never writes to us

Mother says hes been too busy said Bobbie but hell write soon
she says

I say Phyllis suggested lets all wave to the Green Dragon as it
goes by If its a magic dragon itll understand and take our loves to
Father And if it isnt three waves arent much We shall never miss
them

So when the Green Dragon tore shrieking out of the mouth of its dark
lair which was the tunnel all three children stood on the railing and
waved their pockethandkerchiefs without stopping to think whether they
were clean handkerchiefs or the reverse They were as a matter of fact
very much the reverse

And out of a firstclass carriage a hand waved back A quite clean hand
It held a newspaper It was the old gentlemans hand

After this it became the custom for waves to be exchanged between the
children and the 915

And the children especially the girls liked to think that perhaps the
old gentleman knew Father and would meet him in business wherever
that shady retreat might be and tell him how his three children stood
on a rail far away in the green country and waved their love to him
every morning wet or fine

For they were now able to go out in all sorts of weather such as they
would never have been allowed to go out in when they lived in their
villa house This was Aunt Emmas doing and the children felt more and
more that they had not been quite fair to this unattractive aunt when
they found how useful were the long gaiters and waterproof coats that
they had laughed at her for buying for them

Mother all this time was very busy with her writing She used to send
off a good many long blue envelopes with stories in themand large
envelopes of different sizes and colours used to come to her Sometimes
she would sigh when she opened them and say

Another story come home to roost Oh dear Oh dear and then the
children would be very sorry

But sometimes she would wave the envelope in the air and sayHooray
hooray Heres a sensible Editor Hes taken my story and this is the
proof of it

At first the children thought the Proof meant the letter the sensible
Editor had written but they presently got to know that the proof was
long slips of paper with the story printed on them

Whenever an Editor was sensible there were buns for tea

One day Peter was going down to the village to get buns to celebrate
the sensibleness of the Editor of the Childrens Globe when he met the
Station Master

Peter felt very uncomfortable for he had now had time to think over the
affair of the coalmine He did not like to say Good morning to the
Station Master as you usually do to anyone you meet on a lonely road
because he had a hot feeling which spread even to his ears that the
Station Master might not care to speak to a person who had stolen coals
Stolen is a nasty word but Peter felt it was the right one So he
looked down and said Nothing

It was the Station Master who said Good morning as he passed by And
Peter answered Good morning Then he thought

Perhaps he doesnt know who I am by daylight or he wouldnt be so
polite

And he did not like the feeling which thinking this gave him And then
before he knew what he was going to do he ran after the Station Master
who stopped when he heard Peters hasty boots crunching the road
and coming up with him very breathless and with his ears now quite
magentacoloured he said

I dont want you to be polite to me if you dont know me when you see
me

Eh said the Station Master

I thought perhaps you didnt know it was me that took the coals
Peter went on when you said Good morning But it was and Im sorry
There

Why said the Station Master I wasnt thinking anything at all about
the precious coals Let bygones be bygones And where were you off to in
such a hurry

Im going to buy buns for tea said Peter

I thought you were all so poor said the Station Master

So we are said Peter confidentially but we always have three
pennyworth of halfpennies for tea whenever Mother sells a story or a
poem or anything

Oh said the Station Master so your Mother writes stories does
she

The beautifulest you ever read said Peter

You ought to be very proud to have such a clever Mother

Yes said Peter but she used to play with us more before she had to
be so clever

Well said the Station Master I must be getting along You give us
a look in at the Station whenever you feel so inclined And as to coals
its a word thatwelloh no we never mention it eh

Thank you said Peter Im very glad its all straightened out
between us And he went on across the canal bridge to the village to
get the buns feeling more comfortable in his mind than he had felt
since the hand of the Station Master had fastened on his collar that
night among the coals

Next day when they had sent the threefold wave of greeting to Father by
the Green Dragon and the old gentleman had waved back as usual Peter
proudly led the way to the station

But ought we said Bobbie

After the coals she means Phyllis explained

I met the Station Master yesterday said Peter in an offhand way
and he pretended not to hear what Phyllis had said he expresspecially
invited us to go down any time we liked

After the coals repeated Phyllis Stop a minutemy bootlace is
undone again

It always IS undone again said Peter and the Station Master was
more of a gentleman than youll ever be Philthrowing coal at a chaps
head like that

Phyllis did up her bootlace and went on in silence but her shoulders
shook and presently a fat tear fell off her nose and splashed on the
metal of the railway line Bobbie saw it

Why whats the matter darling she said stopping short and putting
her arm round the heaving shoulders

He called me ununungentlemanly sobbed Phyllis I didnt never call
him unladylike not even when he tied my Clorinda to the firewood bundle
and burned her at the stake for a martyr

Peter had indeed perpetrated this outrage a year or two before

Well you began you know said Bobbie honestly about coals and all
that Dont you think youd better both unsay everything since the wave
and let honour be satisfied

I will if Peter will said Phyllis sniffling

All right said Peter honour is satisfied Here use my hankie
Phil for goodness sake if youve lost yours as usual I wonder what
you do with them

You had my last one said Phyllis indignantly to tie up the
rabbithutch door with But youre very ungrateful Its quite right
what it says in the poetry book about sharper than a serpent it is to
have a toothless childbut it means ungrateful when it says toothless
Miss Lowe told me so

All right said Peter impatiently Im sorry THERE Now will you
come on

They reached the station and spent a joyous two hours with the Porter
He was a worthy man and seemed never tired of answering the questions
that begin with Why which many people in higher ranks of life often
seem weary of

He told them many things that they had not known beforeas for
instance that the things that hook carriages together are called
couplings and that the pipes like great serpents that hang over the
couplings are meant to stop the train with

If you could get a holt of one o them when the train is going and pull
em apart said he shed stop dead off with a jerk

Whos she said Phyllis

The train of course said the Porter After that the train was never
again It to the children

And you know the thing in the carriages where it says on it Five
pounds fine for improper use If you was to improperly use that the
train ud stop

And if you used it properly said Roberta

It ud stop just the same I suppose said he but it isnt proper
use unless youre being murdered There was an old lady oncesomeone
kidded her on it was a refreshmentroom bell and she used it improper
not being in danger of her life though hungry and when the train
stopped and the guard came along expecting to find someone weltering in
their last moments she says Oh please Mister Ill take a glass of
stout and a bath bun she says And the train was seven minutes behind
her time as it was

What did the guard say to the old lady

_I_ dunno replied the Porter but I lay she didnt forget it in a
hurry whatever it was

In such delightful conversation the time went by all too quickly

The Station Master came out once or twice from that sacred inner temple
behind the place where the hole is that they sell you tickets through
and was most jolly with them all

Just as if coal had never been discovered Phyllis whispered to her
sister

He gave them each an orange and promised to take them up into the
signalbox one of these days when he wasnt so busy

Several trains went through the station and Peter noticed for the first
time that engines have numbers on them like cabs

Yes said the Porter I knowed a young gent as used to take down the
numbers of every single one he seed in a green notebook with silver
corners it was owing to his father being very welltodo in the
wholesale stationery

Peter felt that he could take down numbers too even if he was not
the son of a wholesale stationer As he did not happen to have a green
leather notebook with silver corners the Porter gave him a yellow
envelope and on it he noted

 379
 663

and felt that this was the beginning of what would be a most interesting
collection

That night at tea he asked Mother if she had a green leather notebook
with silver corners She had not but when she heard what he wanted it
for she gave him a little black one

It has a few pages torn out said she but it will hold quite a lot
of numbers and when its full Ill give you another Im so glad you
like the railway Only please you mustnt walk on the line

Not if we face the way the trains coming asked Peter after a gloomy
pause in which glances of despair were exchanged

Noreally not said Mother

Then Phyllis said Mother didnt YOU ever walk on the railway lines
when you were little

Mother was an honest and honourable Mother so she had to say Yes

Well then said Phyllis

But darlings you dont know how fond I am of you What should I do if
you got hurt

Are you fonder of us than Granny was of you when you were little
Phyllis asked Bobbie made signs to her to stop but Phyllis never did
see signs no matter how plain they might be

Mother did not answer for a minute She got up to put more water in the
teapot

No one she said at last ever loved anyone more than my mother loved
me

Then she was quiet again and Bobbie kicked Phyllis hard under the
table because Bobbie understood a little bit the thoughts that were
making Mother so quietthe thoughts of the time when Mother was a
little girl and was all the world to HER mother It seems so easy and
natural to run to Mother when one is in trouble Bobbie understood a
little how people do not leave off running to their mothers when they
are in trouble even when they are grown up and she thought she knew a
little what it must be to be sad and have no mother to run to any more

So she kicked Phyllis who said

What are you kicking me like that for Bob

And then Mother laughed a little and sighed and said

Very well then Only let me be sure you do know which way the trains
comeand dont walk on the line near the tunnel or near corners

Trains keep to the left like carriages said Peter so if we keep to
the right were bound to see them coming

Very well said Mother and I dare say you think that she ought not
to have said it But she remembered about when she was a little girl
herself and she did say itand neither her own children nor you nor
any other children in the world could ever understand exactly what it
cost her to do it Only some few of you like Bobbie may understand a
very little bit

It was the very next day that Mother had to stay in bed because her head
ached so Her hands were burning hot and she would not eat anything
and her throat was very sore

If I was you Mum said Mrs Viney I should take and send for the
doctor Theres a lot of catchy complaints agoing about just now My
sisters eldestshe took a chill and it went to her inside two years
ago come Christmas and shes never been the same gell since

Mother wouldnt at first but in the evening she felt so much worse that
Peter was sent to the house in the village that had three laburnum trees
by the gate and on the gate a brass plate with W W Forrest MD on
it

W W Forrest MD came at once He talked to Peter on the way back
He seemed a most charming and sensible man interested in railways and
rabbits and really important things

When he had seen Mother he said it was influenza

Now Lady Graveairs he said in the hall to Bobbie I suppose youll
want to be headnurse

Of course said she

Well then Ill send down some medicine Keep up a good fire Have
some strong beef tea made ready to give her as soon as the fever goes
down She can have grapes now and beef essenceand sodawater and
milk and youd better get in a bottle of brandy The best brandy Cheap
brandy is worse than poison

She asked him to write it all down and he did

When Bobbie showed Mother the list he had written Mother laughed It
WAS a laugh Bobbie decided though it was rather odd and feeble

Nonsense said Mother laying in bed with eyes as bright as beads
I cant afford all that rubbish Tell Mrs Viney to boil two pounds of
scragend of the neck for your dinners tomorrow and I can have some
of the broth Yes I should like some more water now love And will you
get a basin and sponge my hands

Roberta obeyed When she had done everything she could to make Mother
less uncomfortable she went down to the others Her cheeks were very
red her lips set tight and her eyes almost as bright as Mothers

She told them what the Doctor had said and what Mother had said

And now said she when she had told all theres no one but us to do
anything and weve got to do it Ive got the shilling for the mutton

We can do without the beastly mutton said Peter bread and butter
will support life People have lived on less on desert islands many a
time

Of course said his sister And Mrs Viney was sent to the village to
get as much brandy and sodawater and beef tea as she could buy for a
shilling

But even if we never have anything to eat at all said Phyllis you
cant get all those other things with our dinner money

No said Bobbie frowning we must find out some other way Now
THINK everybody just as hard as ever you can

They did think And presently they talked And later when Bobbie had
gone up to sit with Mother in case she wanted anything the other two
were very busy with scissors and a white sheet and a paint brush and
the pot of Brunswick black that Mrs Viney used for grates and fenders
They did not manage to do what they wished exactly with the first
sheet so they took another out of the linen cupboard It did not occur
to them that they were spoiling good sheets which cost good money They
only knew that they were making a goodbut what they were making comes
later

Bobbies bed had been moved into Mothers room and several times in
the night she got up to mend the fire and to give her mother milk and
sodawater Mother talked to herself a good deal but it did not seem
to mean anything And once she woke up suddenly and called out Mamma
mamma and Bobbie knew she was calling for Granny and that she had
forgotten that it was no use calling because Granny was dead

In the early morning Bobbie heard her name and jumped out of bed and ran
to Mothers bedside

Ohah yesI think I was asleep said Mother My poor little duck
how tired youll beI do hate to give you all this trouble

Trouble said Bobbie

Ah dont cry sweet Mother said I shall be all right in a day or
two

And Bobbie said Yes and tried to smile

When you are used to ten hours of solid sleep to get up three or four
times in your sleeptime makes you feel as though you had been up all
night Bobbie felt quite stupid and her eyes were sore and stiff but
she tidied the room and arranged everything neatly before the Doctor
came

This was at halfpast eight

Everything going on all right little Nurse he said at the front
door Did you get the brandy

Ive got the brandy said Bobbie in a little flat bottle

I didnt see the grapes or the beef tea though said he

No said Bobbie firmly but you will tomorrow And theres some
beef stewing in the oven for beef tea

Who told you to do that he asked

I noticed what Mother did when Phil had mumps

Right said the Doctor Now you get your old woman to sit with your
mother and then you eat a good breakfast and go straight to bed and
sleep till dinnertime We cant afford to have the headnurse ill

He was really quite a nice doctor

When the 915 came out of the tunnel that morning the old gentleman in
the firstclass carriage put down his newspaper and got ready to wave
his hand to the three children on the fence But this morning there were
not three There was only one And that was Peter

Peter was not on the railings either as usual He was standing in front
of them in an attitude like that of a showman showing off the animals
in a menagerie or of the kind clergyman when he points with a wand at
the Scenes from Palestine when there is a magiclantern and he is
explaining it

Peter was pointing too And what he was pointing at was a large white
sheet nailed against the fence On the sheet there were thick black
letters more than a foot long

Some of them had run a little because of Phyllis having put the
Brunswick black on too eagerly but the words were quite easy to read

And this what the old gentleman and several other people in the train
read in the large black letters on the white sheet

 LOOK OUT AT THE STATION

A good many people did look out at the station and were disappointed
for they saw nothing unusual The old gentleman looked out too and at
first he too saw nothing more unusual than the gravelled platform and
the sunshine and the wallflowers and forgetmenots in the station
borders It was only just as the train was beginning to puff and pull
itself together to start again that he saw Phyllis She was quite out of
breath with running

Oh she said I thought Id missed you My bootlaces would keep
coming down and I fell over them twice Here take it

She thrust a warm dampish letter into his hand as the train moved

He leaned back in his corner and opened the letter This is what he
read

Dear Mr We do not know your name

Mother is ill and the doctor says to give her the things at the end of
the letter but she says she cant aford it and to get mutton for
us and she will have the broth We do not know anybody here but you
because Father is away and we do not know the address Father will pay
you or if he has lost all his money or anything Peter will pay you
when he is a man We promise it on our honer IOU for all the things
Mother wants

 sined Peter

Will you give the parsel to the Station Master because of us not
knowing what train you come down by Say it is for Peter that was sorry
about the coals and he will know all right

 Roberta
 Phyllis
 Peter

Then came the list of things the Doctor had ordered

The old gentleman read it through once and his eyebrows went up He
read it twice and smiled a little When he had read it thrice he put it
in his pocket and went on reading The Times

At about six that evening there was a knock at the back door The three
children rushed to open it and there stood the friendly Porter who had
told them so many interesting things about railways He dumped down a
big hamper on the kitchen flags

Old gent he said he asked me to fetch it up straight away

Thank you very much said Peter and then as the Porter lingered he
added

Im most awfully sorry I havent got twopence to give you like Father
does but

You drop it if you please said the Porter indignantly I wasnt
thinking about no tuppences I only wanted to say I was sorry your Mamma
wasnt so well and to ask how she finds herself this eveningand
Ive fetched her along a bit of sweetbrier very sweet to smell it is
Twopence indeed said he and produced a bunch of sweetbrier from his
hat just like a conjurer as Phyllis remarked afterwards

Thank you very much said Peter and I beg your pardon about the
twopence

No offence said the Porter untruly but politely and went

Then the children undid the hamper First there was straw and then
there were fine shavings and then came all the things they had asked
for and plenty of them and then a good many things they had not asked
for among others peaches and port wine and two chickens a cardboard
box of big red roses with long stalks and a tall thin green bottle
of lavender water and three smaller fatter bottles of eaudeCologne
There was a letter too

Dear Roberta and Phyllis and Peter it said here are the things you
want Your mother will want to know where they came from Tell her they
were sent by a friend who heard she was ill When she is well again you
must tell her all about it of course And if she says you ought not to
have asked for the things tell her that I say you were quite right
and that I hope she will forgive me for taking the liberty of allowing
myself a very great pleasure

The letter was signed G P something that the children couldnt read

I think we WERE right said Phyllis

Right Of course we were right said Bobbie

All the same said Peter with his hands in his pockets I dont
exactly look forward to telling Mother the whole truth about it

Were not to do it till shes well said Bobbie and when shes well
we shall be so happy we shant mind a little fuss like that Oh just
look at the roses I must take them up to her

And the sweetbrier said Phyllis sniffing it loudly dont forget
the sweetbrier

As if I should said Roberta Mother told me the other day there was
a thick hedge of it at her mothers house when she was a little girl



Chapter IV The engineburglar


What was left of the second sheet and the Brunswick black came in very
nicely to make a banner bearing the legend

 SHE IS NEARLY WELL THANK YOU

and this was displayed to the Green Dragon about a fortnight after the
arrival of the wonderful hamper The old gentleman saw it and waved
a cheerful response from the train And when this had been done the
children saw that now was the time when they must tell Mother what they
had done when she was ill And it did not seem nearly so easy as they
had thought it would be But it had to be done And it was done Mother
was extremely angry She was seldom angry and now she was angrier than
they had ever known her This was horrible But it was much worse when
she suddenly began to cry Crying is catching I believe like measles
and whoopingcough At any rate everyone at once found itself taking
part in a cryingparty

Mother stopped first She dried her eyes and then she said

Im sorry I was so angry darlings because I know you didnt
understand

We didnt mean to be naughty Mammy sobbed Bobbie and Peter and
Phyllis sniffed

Now listen said Mother its quite true that were poor but
we have enough to live on You mustnt go telling everyone about our
affairsits not right And you must never never never ask strangers
to give you things Now always remember thatwont you

They all hugged her and rubbed their damp cheeks against hers and
promised that they would

And Ill write a letter to your old gentleman and I shall tell him
that I didnt approveoh of course I shall thank him too for
his kindness Its YOU I dont approve of my darlings not the old
gentleman He was as kind as ever he could be And you can give the
letter to the Station Master to give himand we wont say any more
about it

Afterwards when the children were alone Bobbie said

Isnt Mother splendid You catch any other grownup saying they were
sorry they had been angry

Yes said Peter she IS splendid but its rather awful when shes
angry

Shes like Avenging and Bright in the song said Phyllis I should
like to look at her if it wasnt so awful She looks so beautiful when
shes really downright furious

They took the letter down to the Station Master

I thought you said you hadnt got any friends except in London said
he

Weve made him since said Peter

But he doesnt live hereabouts

Nowe just know him on the railway

Then the Station Master retired to that sacred inner temple behind the
little window where the tickets are sold and the children went down
to the Porters room and talked to the Porter They learned several
interesting things from himamong others that his name was Perks
that he was married and had three children that the lamps in front of
engines are called headlights and the ones at the back taillights

And that just shows whispered Phyllis that trains really ARE
dragons in disguise with proper heads and tails

It was on this day that the children first noticed that all engines are
not alike

Alike said the Porter whose name was Perks lor love you no
Miss No more alike nor what you an me are That little un without
a tender as went by just now all on her own that was a tank that
wasshes off to do some shunting tother side o Maidbridge Thats as
it might be you Miss Then theres goods engines great strong things
with three wheels each sidejoined with rods to strengthen emas it
might be me Then theres mainline engines as it might be this
ere young gentleman when he grows up and wins all the races at is
schoolso he will The mainline engine shes built for speed as well
as power Thats one to the 915 up

The Green Dragon said Phyllis

We calls her the Snail Miss among ourselves said the Porter Shes
oftener beindand nor any train on the line

But the engines green said Phyllis

Yes Miss said Perks sos a snail some seasons o the year

The children agreed as they went home to dinner that the Porter was most
delightful company

Next day was Robertas birthday In the afternoon she was politely but
firmly requested to get out of the way and keep there till teatime

You arent to see what were going to do till its done its a
glorious surprise said Phyllis

And Roberta went out into the garden all alone She tried to be
grateful but she felt she would much rather have helped in whatever it
was than have to spend her birthday afternoon by herself no matter how
glorious the surprise might be

Now that she was alone she had time to think and one of the things she
thought of most was what mother had said in one of those feverish nights
when her hands were so hot and her eyes so bright

The words were Oh what a doctors bill therell be for this

She walked round and round the garden among the rosebushes that hadnt
any roses yet only buds and the lilac bushes and syringas and American
currants and the more she thought of the doctors bill the less she
liked the thought of it

And presently she made up her mind She went out through the side door
of the garden and climbed up the steep field to where the road runs
along by the canal She walked along until she came to the bridge that
crosses the canal and leads to the village and here she waited It was
very pleasant in the sunshine to lean ones elbows on the warm stone
of the bridge and look down at the blue water of the canal Bobbie had
never seen any other canal except the Regents Canal and the water of
that is not at all a pretty colour And she had never seen any river at
all except the Thames which also would be all the better if its face
was washed

Perhaps the children would have loved the canal as much as the railway
but for two things One was that they had found the railway FIRSTon
that first wonderful morning when the house and the country and the
moors and rocks and great hills were all new to them They had not found
the canal till some days later The other reason was that everyone on
the railway had been kind to themthe Station Master the Porter and
the old gentleman who waved And the people on the canal were anything
but kind

The people on the canal were of course the bargees who steered the
slow barges up and down or walked beside the old horses that trampled
up the mud of the towingpath and strained at the long towropes

Peter had once asked one of the bargees the time and had been told
to get out of that in a tone so fierce that he did not stop to say
anything about his having just as much right on the towingpath as the
man himself Indeed he did not even think of saying it till some time
later

Then another day when the children thought they would like to fish in
the canal a boy in a barge threw lumps of coal at them and one of
these hit Phyllis on the back of the neck She was just stooping down to
tie up her bootlaceand though the coal hardly hurt at all it made her
not care very much about going on fishing

On the bridge however Roberta felt quite safe because she could look
down on the canal and if any boy showed signs of meaning to throw coal
she could duck behind the parapet

Presently there was a sound of wheels which was just what she expected

The wheels were the wheels of the Doctors dogcart and in the cart of
course was the Doctor

He pulled up and called out

Hullo head nurse Want a lift

I wanted to see you said Bobbie

Your mothers not worse I hope said the Doctor

Nobut

Well skip in then and well go for a drive

Roberta climbed in and the brown horse was made to turn roundwhich it
did not like at all for it was looking forward to its teaI mean its
oats

This IS jolly said Bobbie as the dogcart flew along the road by the
canal

We could throw a stone down any one of your three chimneys said the
Doctor as they passed the house

Yes said Bobbie but youd have to be a jolly good shot

How do you know Im not said the Doctor Now then whats the
trouble

Bobbie fidgeted with the hook of the driving apron

Come out with it said the Doctor

Its rather hard you see said Bobbie to out with it because of
what Mother said

What DID Mother say

She said I wasnt to go telling everyone that were poor But you
arent everyone are you

Not at all said the Doctor cheerfully Well

Well I know doctors are very extravagantI mean expensive and Mrs
Viney told me that her doctoring only cost her twopence a week because
she belonged to a Club

Yes

You see she told me what a good doctor you were and I asked her how
she could afford you because shes much poorer than we are Ive been
in her house and I know And then she told me about the Club and I
thought Id ask youandoh I dont want Mother to be worried Cant
we be in the Club too the same as Mrs Viney

The Doctor was silent He was rather poor himself and he had been
pleased at getting a new family to attend So I think his feelings at
that minute were rather mixed

You arent cross with me are you said Bobbie in a very small voice

The Doctor roused himself

Cross How could I be Youre a very sensible little woman Now look
here dont you worry Ill make it all right with your Mother even if
I have to make a special brandnew Club all for her Look here this is
where the Aqueduct begins

Whats an Aquewhats its name asked Bobbie

A water bridge said the Doctor Look

The road rose to a bridge over the canal To the left was a steep rocky
cliff with trees and shrubs growing in the cracks of the rock And the
canal here left off running along the top of the hill and started to run
on a bridge of its owna great bridge with tall arches that went right
across the valley

Bobbie drew a long breath

It IS grand isnt it she said Its like pictures in the History of
Rome

Right said the Doctor thats just exactly what it IS like
The Romans were dead nuts on aqueducts Its a splendid piece of
engineering

I thought engineering was making engines

Ah there are different sorts of engineeringmaking road and bridges
and tunnels is one kind And making fortifications is another Well we
must be turning back And remember you arent to worry about doctors
bills or youll be ill yourself and then Ill send you in a bill as
long as the aqueduct

When Bobbie had parted from the Doctor at the top of the field that ran
down from the road to Three Chimneys she could not feel that she had
done wrong She knew that Mother would perhaps think differently
But Bobbie felt that for once she was the one who was right and she
scrambled down the rocky slope with a really happy feeling

Phyllis and Peter met her at the back door They were unnaturally clean
and neat and Phyllis had a red bow in her hair There was only just
time for Bobbie to make herself tidy and tie up her hair with a blue bow
before a little bell rang

There said Phyllis thats to show the surprise is ready Now
you wait till the bell rings again and then you may come into the
diningroom

So Bobbie waited

Tinkle tinkle said the little bell and Bobbie went into the
diningroom feeling rather shy Directly she opened the door she found
herself as it seemed in a new world of light and flowers and singing
Mother and Peter and Phyllis were standing in a row at the end of the
table The shutters were shut and there were twelve candles on the
table one for each of Robertas years The table was covered with a
sort of pattern of flowers and at Robertas place was a thick wreath of
forgetmenots and several most interesting little packages And Mother
and Phyllis and Peter were singingto the first part of the tune of St
Patricks Day Roberta knew that Mother had written the words on purpose
for her birthday It was a little way of Mothers on birthdays It
had begun on Bobbies fourth birthday when Phyllis was a baby Bobbie
remembered learning the verses to say to Father for a surprise She
wondered if Mother had remembered too The fouryearold verse had
been

 Daddy dear Im only four
 And Id rather not be more
 Fours the nicest age to be
 Two and two and one and three
 What I love is two and two
 Mother Peter Phil and you
 What you love is one and three
 Mother Peter Phil and me
 Give your little girl a kiss
 Because she learned and told you this

The song the others were singing now went like this

 Our darling Roberta
 No sorrow shall hurt her
 If we can prevent it
 Her whole life long
 Her birthdays our fete day
 Well make it our great day
 And give her our presents
 And sing her our song
 May pleasures attend her
 And may the Fates send her
 The happiest journey
 Along her lifes way
 With skies bright above her
 And dear ones to love her
 Dear Bob Many happy
 Returns of the day

When they had finished singing they cried Three cheers for our
Bobbie and gave them very loudly Bobbie felt exactly as though she
were going to cryyou know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose
and the pricking in your eyelids But before she had time to begin they
were all kissing and hugging her

Now said Mother look at your presents

They were very nice presents There was a green and red needlebook that
Phyllis had made herself in secret moments There was a darling little
silver brooch of Mothers shaped like a buttercup which Bobbie had
known and loved for years but which she had never never thought would
come to be her very own There was also a pair of blue glass vases from
Mrs Viney Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop And
there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes

Mother fitted the forgetmenot crown on Bobbies brown head

And now look at the table she said

There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar with Dear
Bobbie on it in pink sweets and there were buns and jam but
the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with
flowerswallflowers were laid all round the teatraythere was a ring
of forgetmenots round each plate The cake had a wreath of white lilac
round it and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all
done with single blooms of lilac or wallflower or laburnum

Its a mapa map of the railway cried Peter Lookthose lilac
lines are the metalsand theres the station done in brown wallflowers
The laburnum is the train and there are the signalboxes and the road
up to hereand those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old
gentlemanthats him the pansy in the laburnum train

And theres Three Chimneys done in the purple primroses said
Phyllis And that little tiny rosebud is Mother looking out for us
when were late for tea Peter invented it all and we got all the
flowers from the station We thought youd like it better

Thats my present said Peter suddenly dumping down his adored
steamengine on the table in front of her Its tender had been lined
with fresh white paper and was full of sweets

Oh Peter cried Bobbie quite overcome by this munificence not your
own dear little engine that youre so fond of

Oh no said Peter very promptly not the engine Only the sweets

Bobbie couldnt help her face changing a littlenot so much because she
was disappointed at not getting the engine as because she had thought
it so very noble of Peter and now she felt she had been silly to think
it Also she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as
well as the sweets So her face changed Peter saw it He hesitated a
minute then his face changed too and he said I mean not ALL the
engine Ill let you go halves if you like

Youre a brick cried Bobbie its a splendid present She said no
more aloud but to herself she said

That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didnt mean
to Well the broken half shall be my half of the engine and Ill get
it mended and give it back to Peter for his birthdayYes Mother
dear I should like to cut the cake she added and tea began

It was a delightful birthday After tea Mother played games with
themany game they likedand of course their first choice was
blindmansbuff in the course of which Bobbies forgetmenot wreath
twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed there Then
when it was near bedtime and time to calm down Mother had a lovely new
story to read to them

You wont sit up late working will you Mother Bobbie asked as they
said good night

And Mother said no she wouldntshe would only just write to Father
and then go to bed

But when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her presentsfor she felt
she really could not be separated from them all nightMother was not
writing but leaning her head on her arms and her arms on the table I
think it was rather good of Bobbie to slip quietly away saying over and
over She doesnt want me to know shes unhappy and I wont know I
wont know But it made a sad end to the birthday

      

The very next morning Bobbie began to watch her opportunity to get
Peters engine mended secretly And the opportunity came the very next
afternoon

Mother went by train to the nearest town to do shopping When she went
there she always went to the Postoffice Perhaps to post her letters
to Father for she never gave them to the children or Mrs Viney to
post and she never went to the village herself Peter and Phyllis went
with her Bobbie wanted an excuse not to go but try as she would she
couldnt think of a good one And just when she felt that all was lost
her frock caught on a big nail by the kitchen door and there was a great
crisscross tear all along the front of the skirt I assure you this was
really an accident So the others pitied her and went without her
for there was no time for her to change because they were rather late
already and had to hurry to the station to catch the train

When they had gone Bobbie put on her everyday frock and went down to
the railway She did not go into the station but she went along the
line to the end of the platform where the engine is when the down train
is alongside the platformthe place where there are a water tank and
a long limp leather hose like an elephants trunk She hid behind a
bush on the other side of the railway She had the toy engine done up in
brown paper and she waited patiently with it under her arm

Then when the next train came in and stopped Bobbie went across the
metals of the upline and stood beside the engine She had never been so
close to an engine before It looked much larger and harder than she
had expected and it made her feel very small indeed and somehow very
softas if she could very very easily be hurt rather badly

I know what silkworms feel like now said Bobbie to herself

The enginedriver and fireman did not see her They were leaning out
on the other side telling the Porter a tale about a dog and a leg of
mutton

If you please said Robertabut the engine was blowing off steam and
no one heard her

If you please Mr Engineer she spoke a little louder but the Engine
happened to speak at the same moment and of course Robertas soft
little voice hadnt a chance

It seemed to her that the only way would be to climb on to the engine
and pull at their coats The step was high but she got her knee on it
and clambered into the cab she stumbled and fell on hands and knees on
the base of the great heap of coals that led up to the square opening in
the tender The engine was not above the weaknesses of its fellows it
was making a great deal more noise than there was the slightest need
for And just as Roberta fell on the coals the enginedriver who
had turned without seeing her started the engine and when Bobbie had
picked herself up the train was movingnot fast but much too fast for
her to get off

All sorts of dreadful thoughts came to her all together in one horrible
flash There were such things as express trains that went on she
supposed for hundreds of miles without stopping Suppose this should be
one of them How would she get home again She had no money to pay for
the return journey

And Ive no business here Im an engineburglarthats what I am
she thought I shouldnt wonder if they could lock me up for this And
the train was going faster and faster

There was something in her throat that made it impossible for her to
speak She tried twice The men had their backs to her They were doing
something to things that looked like taps

Suddenly she put out her hand and caught hold of the nearest sleeve The
man turned with a start and he and Roberta stood for a minute looking
at each other in silence Then the silence was broken by them both

The man said Heres a bloomin go and Roberta burst into tears

The other man said he was blooming well blestor something like itbut
though naturally surprised they were not exactly unkind

Youre a naughty little gell thats what you are said the fireman
and the enginedriver said

Daring little piece I call her but they made her sit down on an iron
seat in the cab and told her to stop crying and tell them what she meant
by it

She did stop as soon as she could One thing that helped her was the
thought that Peter would give almost his ears to be in her placeon a
real enginereally going The children had often wondered whether any
enginedriver could be found noble enough to take them for a ride on an
engineand now there she was She dried her eyes and sniffed earnestly

Now then said the fireman out with it What do you mean by it
eh

Oh please sniffed Bobbie

Try again said the enginedriver encouragingly

Bobbie tried again

Please Mr Engineer she said I did call out to you from the
line but you didnt hear meand I just climbed up to touch you on the
armquite gently I meant to do itand then I fell into the coalsand
I am so sorry if I frightened you Oh dont be crossoh please
dont She sniffed again

We aint so much CROSS said the fireman as interested like It
aint every day a little gell tumbles into our coal bunker outer the
sky is it Bill What did you DO it foreh

Thats the point agreed the enginedriver what did you do it FOR

Bobbie found that she had not quite stopped crying The enginedriver
patted her on the back and said Here cheer up Mate It aint so bad
as all that ere Ill be bound

I wanted said Bobbie much cheered to find herself addressed as
MateI only wanted to ask you if youd be so kind as to mend this
She picked up the brownpaper parcel from among the coals and undid the
string with hot red fingers that trembled

Her feet and legs felt the scorch of the engine fire but her shoulders
felt the wild chill rush of the air The engine lurched and shook and
rattled and as they shot under a bridge the engine seemed to shout in
her ears

The fireman shovelled on coals

Bobbie unrolled the brown paper and disclosed the toy engine

I thought she said wistfully that perhaps youd mend this for
mebecause youre an engineer you know

The enginedriver said he was blowed if he wasnt blest

Im blest if I aint blowed remarked the fireman

But the enginedriver took the little engine and looked at itand the
fireman ceased for an instant to shovel coal and looked too

Its like your precious cheek said the enginedriverwhatever made
you think wed be bothered tinkering penny toys

I didnt mean it for precious cheek said Bobbie only everybody that
has anything to do with railways is so kind and good I didnt think
youd mind You dont reallydo you she added for she had seen a not
unkindly wink pass between the two

My trades driving of an engine not mending her especially such a
houtsize in engines as this ere said Bill An ow are we agoin
to get you back to your sorrowing friends and relations and all be
forgiven and forgotten

If youll put me down next time you stop said Bobbie firmly though
her heart beat fiercely against her arm as she clasped her hands and
lend me the money for a thirdclass ticket Ill pay you backhonour
bright Im not a confidence trick like in the newspapersreally Im
not

Youre a little lady every inch said Bill relenting suddenly
and completely Well see you gets home safe An about this
engineJimaint you got neer a pal as can use a soldering iron
Seems to me thats about all the little bounder wants doing to it

Thats what Father said Bobbie explained eagerly Whats that for

She pointed to a little brass wheel that he had turned as he spoke

Thats the injector

Inwhat

Injector to fill up the boiler

Oh said Bobbie mentally registering the fact to tell the others
that IS interesting

This eres the automatic brake Bill went on flattered by her
enthusiasm You just move this ere little handledo it with one
finger you canand the train jolly soon stops Thats what they call
the Power of Science in the newspapers

He showed her two little dials like clock faces and told her how one
showed how much steam was going and the other showed if the brake was
working properly

By the time she had seen him shut off steam with a big shining steel
handle Bobbie knew more about the inside working of an engine than she
had ever thought there was to know and Jim had promised that his second
cousins wifes brother should solder the toy engine or Jim would know
the reason why Besides all the knowledge she had gained Bobbie felt
that she and Bill and Jim were now friends for life and that they had
wholly and forever forgiven her for stumbling uninvited among the sacred
coals of their tender

At Stacklepoole Junction she parted from them with warm expressions of
mutual regard They handed her over to the guard of a returning traina
friend of theirsand she had the joy of knowing what guards do in their
secret fastnesses and understood how when you pull the communication
cord in railway carriages a wheel goes round under the guards nose and
a loud bell rings in his ears She asked the guard why his van smelt
so fishy and learned that he had to carry a lot of fish every day and
that the wetness in the hollows of the corrugated floor had all drained
out of boxes full of plaice and cod and mackerel and soles and smelts

Bobbie got home in time for tea and she felt as though her mind would
burst with all that had been put into it since she parted from the
others How she blessed the nail that had torn her frock

Where have you been asked the others

To the station of course said Roberta But she would not tell a word
of her adventures till the day appointed when she mysteriously led them
to the station at the hour of the 319s transit and proudly introduced
them to her friends Bill and Jim Jims second cousins wifes brother
had not been unworthy of the sacred trust reposed in him The toy engine
was literally as good as new

Goodbyeoh goodbye said Bobbie just before the engine screamed
ITS goodbye I shall always always love youand Jims second
cousins wifes brother as well

And as the three children went home up the hill Peter hugging the
engine now quite its own self again Bobbie told with joyous leaps of
the heart the story of how she had been an Engineburglar



Chapter V Prisoners and captives


It was one day when Mother had gone to Maidbridge She had gone alone
but the children were to go to the station to meet her And loving the
station as they did it was only natural that they should be there a
good hour before there was any chance of Mothers train arriving even
if the train were punctual which was most unlikely No doubt they would
have been just as early even if it had been a fine day and all the
delights of woods and fields and rocks and rivers had been open to them
But it happened to be a very wet day and for July very cold There was
a wild wind that drove flocks of dark purple clouds across the sky like
herds of dreamelephants as Phyllis said And the rain stung sharply
so that the way to the station was finished at a run Then the rain fell
faster and harder and beat slantwise against the windows of the booking
office and of the chill place that had General Waiting Room on its door

Its like being in a besieged castle Phyllis said look at the
arrows of the foe striking against the battlements

Its much more like a great gardensquirt said Peter

They decided to wait on the up side for the down platform looked very
wet indeed and the rain was driving right into the little bleak shelter
where downpassengers have to wait for their trains

The hour would be full of incident and of interest for there would be
two up trains and one down to look at before the one that should bring
Mother back

Perhaps itll have stopped raining by then said Bobbie anyhow Im
glad I brought Mothers waterproof and umbrella

They went into the desert spot labelled General Waiting Room and the
time passed pleasantly enough in a game of advertisements You know the
game of course It is something like dumb Crambo The players take
it in turns to go out and then come back and look as like some
advertisement as they can and the others have to guess what
advertisement it is meant to be Bobbie came in and sat down under
Mothers umbrella and made a sharp face and everyone knew she was the
fox who sits under the umbrella in the advertisement Phyllis tried to
make a Magic Carpet of Mothers waterproof but it would not stand out
stiff and raftlike as a Magic Carpet should and nobody could guess
it Everyone thought Peter was carrying things a little too far when he
blacked his face all over with coaldust and struck a spidery attitude
and said he was the blot that advertises somebodys Blue Black Writing
Fluid

It was Phylliss turn again and she was trying to look like the Sphinx
that advertises Whatshisnames Personally Conducted Tours up the Nile
when the sharp ting of the signal announced the up train The children
rushed out to see it pass On its engine were the particular driver
and fireman who were now numbered among the childrens dearest friends
Courtesies passed between them Jim asked after the toy engine and
Bobbie pressed on his acceptance a moist greasy package of toffee that
she had made herself

Charmed by this attention the enginedriver consented to consider her
request that some day he would take Peter for a ride on the engine

Stand back Mates cried the enginedriver suddenly and horf she
goes

And sure enough off the train went The children watched the
taillights of the train till it disappeared round the curve of the
line and then turned to go back to the dusty freedom of the General
Waiting Room and the joys of the advertisement game

They expected to see just one or two people the end of the procession
of passengers who had given up their tickets and gone away Instead the
platform round the door of the station had a dark blot round it and the
dark blot was a crowd of people

Oh cried Peter with a thrill of joyous excitement somethings
happened Come on

They ran down the platform When they got to the crowd they could of
course see nothing but the damp backs and elbows of the people on the
crowds outside Everybody was talking at once It was evident that
something had happened

Its my belief hes nothing worse than a natural said a
farmerishlooking person Peter saw his red cleanshaven face as he
spoke

If you ask me I should say it was a Police Court case said a young
man with a black bag

Not it the Infirmary more like

Then the voice of the Station Master was heard firm and official

Now thenmove along there Ill attend to this if YOU please

But the crowd did not move And then came a voice that thrilled the
children through and through For it spoke in a foreign language And
what is more it was a language that they had never heard They had
heard French spoken and German Aunt Emma knew German and used to sing
a song about bedeuten and zeiten and bin and sin Nor was it Latin
Peter had been in Latin for four terms

It was some comfort anyhow to find that none of the crowd understood
the foreign language any better than the children did

Whats that hes saying asked the farmer heavily

Sounds like French to me said the Station Master who had once been
to Boulogne for the day

It isnt French cried Peter

What is it then asked more than one voice The crowd fell back a
little to see who had spoken and Peter pressed forward so that when
the crowd closed up again he was in the front rank

I dont know what it is said Peter but it isnt French I know
that Then he saw what it was that the crowd had for its centre It
was a manthe man Peter did not doubt who had spoken in that strange
tongue A man with long hair and wild eyes with shabby clothes of a cut
Peter had not seen beforea man whose hands and lips trembled and who
spoke again as his eyes fell on Peter

No its not French said Peter

Try him with French if you know so much about it said the farmerman

Parlay voo Frongsay began Peter boldly and the next moment the
crowd recoiled again for the man with the wild eyes had left leaning
against the wall and had sprung forward and caught Peters hands
and begun to pour forth a flood of words which though he could not
understand a word of them Peter knew the sound of

There said he and turned his hands still clasped in the hands of
the strange shabby figure to throw a glance of triumph at the crowd
there THATS French

What does he say

I dont know Peter was obliged to own it

Here said the Station Master again you move on if you please ILL
deal with this case

A few of the more timid or less inquisitive travellers moved slowly and
reluctantly away And Phyllis and Bobbie got near to Peter All three
had been TAUGHT French at school How deeply they now wished that they
had LEARNED it Peter shook his head at the stranger but he also shook
his hands as warmly and looked at him as kindly as he could A person
in the crowd after some hesitation said suddenly No comprenny and
then blushing deeply backed out of the press and went away

Take him into your room whispered Bobbie to the Station Master
Mother can talk French Shell be here by the next train from
Maidbridge

The Station Master took the arm of the stranger suddenly but not
unkindly But the man wrenched his arm away and cowered back coughing
and trembling and trying to push the Station Master away

Oh dont said Bobbie dont you see how frightened he is He thinks
youre going to shut him up I know he doeslook at his eyes

Theyre like a foxs eyes when the beasts in a trap said the farmer

Oh let me try Bobbie went on I do really know one or two French
words if I could only think of them

Sometimes in moments of great need we can do wonderful thingsthings
that in ordinary life we could hardly even dream of doing Bobbie had
never been anywhere near the top of her French class but she must have
learned something without knowing it for now looking at those wild
hunted eyes she actually remembered and what is more spoke some
French words She said

Vous attendre Ma mere parlez Francais Nouswhats the French for
being kind

Nobody knew

Bong is good said Phyllis

Nous etre bong pour vous

I do not know whether the man understood her words but he understood
the touch of the hand she thrust into his and the kindness of the other
hand that stroked his shabby sleeve

She pulled him gently towards the inmost sanctuary of the Station
Master The other children followed and the Station Master shut the
door in the face of the crowd which stood a little while in the booking
office talking and looking at the fast closed yellow door and then by
ones and twos went its way grumbling

Inside the Station Masters room Bobbie still held the strangers hand
and stroked his sleeve

Heres a go said the Station Master no ticketdoesnt even know
where he wants to go Im not sure now but what I ought to send for the
police

Oh DONT all the children pleaded at once And suddenly Bobbie
got between the others and the stranger for she had seen that he was
crying

By a most unusual piece of good fortune she had a handkerchief in
her pocket By a still more uncommon accident the handkerchief was
moderately clean Standing in front of the stranger she got out the
handkerchief and passed it to him so that the others did not see

Wait till Mother comes Phyllis was saying she does speak French
beautifully Youd just love to hear her

Im sure he hasnt done anything like youre sent to prison for said
Peter

Looks like without visible means to me said the Station Master
Well I dont mind giving him the benefit of the doubt till your Mamma
comes I SHOULD like to know what nations got the credit of HIM that I
should

Then Peter had an idea He pulled an envelope out of his pocket and
showed that it was half full of foreign stamps

Look here he said lets show him these

Bobbie looked and saw that the stranger had dried his eyes with her
handkerchief So she said All right

They showed him an Italian stamp and pointed from him to it and back
again and made signs of question with their eyebrows He shook his
head Then they showed him a Norwegian stampthe common blue kind it
wasand again he signed No Then they showed him a Spanish one and
at that he took the envelope from Peters hand and searched among the
stamps with a hand that trembled The hand that he reached out at last
with a gesture as of one answering a question contained a RUSSIAN
stamp

Hes Russian cried Peter or else hes like the man who wasin
Kipling you know

The train from Maidbridge was signalled

Ill stay with him till you bring Mother in said Bobbie

Youre not afraid Missie

Oh no said Bobbie looking at the stranger as she might have looked
at a strange dog of doubtful temper You wouldnt hurt me would you

She smiled at him and he smiled back a queer crooked smile And then
he coughed again And the heavy rattling swish of the incoming train
swept past and the Station Master and Peter and Phyllis went out to
meet it Bobbie was still holding the strangers hand when they came
back with Mother

The Russian rose and bowed very ceremoniously

Then Mother spoke in French and he replied haltingly at first but
presently in longer and longer sentences

The children watching his face and Mothers knew that he was telling
her things that made her angry and pitying and sorry and indignant all
at once

Well Mum whats it all about The Station Master could not restrain
his curiosity any longer

Oh said Mother its all right Hes a Russian and hes lost his
ticket And Im afraid hes very ill If you dont mind Ill take him
home with me now Hes really quite worn out Ill run down and tell you
all about him tomorrow

I hope you wont find youre taking home a frozen viper said the
Station Master doubtfully

Oh no Mother said brightly and she smiled Im quite sure Im
not Why hes a great man in his own country writes booksbeautiful
booksIve read some of them but Ill tell you all about it
tomorrow

She spoke again in French to the Russian and everyone could see the
surprise and pleasure and gratitude in his eyes He got up and politely
bowed to the Station Master and offered his arm most ceremoniously to
Mother She took it but anybody could have seen that she was helping
him along and not he her

You girls run home and light a fire in the sittingroom Mother said
and Peter had better go for the Doctor

But it was Bobbie who went for the Doctor

I hate to tell you she said breathlessly when she came upon him
in his shirt sleeves weeding his pansybed but Mothers got a very
shabby Russian and Im sure hell have to belong to your Club Im
certain he hasnt got any money We found him at the station

Found him Was he lost then asked the Doctor reaching for his coat

Yes said Bobbie unexpectedly thats just what he was Hes been
telling Mother the sad sweet story of his life in French and she said
would you be kind enough to come directly if you were at home He has a
dreadful cough and hes been crying

The Doctor smiled

Oh dont said Bobbie please dont You wouldnt if youd seen him
I never saw a man cry before You dont know what its like

Dr Forrest wished then that he hadnt smiled

When Bobbie and the Doctor got to Three Chimneys the Russian was
sitting in the armchair that had been Fathers stretching his feet
to the blaze of a bright wood fire and sipping the tea Mother had made
him

The man seems worn out mind and body was what the Doctor said the
coughs bad but theres nothing that cant be cured He ought to go
straight to bed thoughand let him have a fire at night

Ill make one in my room its the only one with a fireplace said
Mother She did and presently the Doctor helped the stranger to bed

There was a big black trunk in Mothers room that none of the children
had ever seen unlocked Now when she had lighted the fire she unlocked
it and took some clothes outmens clothesand set them to air by the
newly lighted fire Bobbie coming in with more wood for the fire saw
the mark on the nightshirt and looked over to the open trunk All
the things she could see were mens clothes And the name marked on the
shirt was Fathers name Then Father hadnt taken his clothes with him
And that nightshirt was one of Fathers new ones Bobbie remembered its
being made just before Peters birthday Why hadnt Father taken his
clothes Bobbie slipped from the room As she went she heard the key
turned in the lock of the trunk Her heart was beating horribly WHY
hadnt Father taken his clothes When Mother came out of the room
Bobbie flung tightly clasping arms round her waist and whispered

MotherDaddy isntisnt DEAD is he

My darling no What made you think of anything so horrible

II dont know said Bobbie angry with herself but still clinging
to that resolution of hers not to see anything that Mother didnt mean
her to see

Mother gave her a hurried hug Daddy was quite QUITE well when I heard
from him last she said and hell come back to us some day Dont
fancy such horrible things darling

Later on when the Russian stranger had been made comfortable for the
night Mother came into the girls room She was to sleep there in
Phylliss bed and Phyllis was to have a mattress on the floor a
most amusing adventure for Phyllis Directly Mother came in two white
figures started up and two eager voices called

Now Mother tell us all about the Russian gentleman

A white shape hopped into the room It was Peter dragging his quilt
behind him like the tail of a white peacock

We have been patient he said and I had to bite my tongue not to
go to sleep and I just nearly went to sleep and I bit too hard and it
hurts ever so DO tell us Make a nice long story of it

I cant make a long story of it tonight said Mother Im very
tired

Bobbie knew by her voice that Mother had been crying but the others
didnt know

Well make it as long as you can said Phil and Bobbie got her arms
round Mothers waist and snuggled close to her

Well its a story long enough to make a whole book of Hes a writer
hes written beautiful books In Russia at the time of the Czar one
dared not say anything about the rich people doing wrong or about the
things that ought to be done to make poor people better and happier If
one did one was sent to prison

But they CANT said Peter people only go to prison when theyve
done wrong

Or when the Judges THINK theyve done wrong said Mother Yes thats
so in England But in Russia it was different And he wrote a beautiful
book about poor people and how to help them Ive read it Theres
nothing in it but goodness and kindness And they sent him to prison for
it He was three years in a horrible dungeon with hardly any light and
all damp and dreadful In prison all alone for three years

Mothers voice trembled a little and stopped suddenly

But Mother said Peter that cant be true NOW It sounds like
something out of a history bookthe Inquisition or something

It WAS true said Mother its all horribly true Well then they
took him out and sent him to Siberia a convict chained to other
convictswicked men whod done all sorts of crimesa long chain of
them and they walked and walked and walked for days and weeks till
he thought theyd never stop walking And overseers went behind them
with whipsyes whipsto beat them if they got tired And some of them
went lame and some fell down and when they couldnt get up and go on
they beat them and then left them to die Oh its all too terrible
And at last he got to the mines and he was condemned to stay there for
lifefor life just for writing a good noble splendid book

How did he get away

When the war came some of the Russian prisoners were allowed to
volunteer as soldiers And he volunteered But he deserted at the first
chance he got and

But thats very cowardly isnt itsaid Peterto desert Especially
when its war

Do you think he owed anything to a country that had done THAT to him
If he did he owed more to his wife and children He didnt know what
had become of them

Oh cried Bobbie he had THEM to think about and be miserable about
TOO then all the time he was in prison

Yes he had them to think about and be miserable about all the time he
was in prison For anything he knew they might have been sent to prison
too They did those things in Russia But while he was in the mines some
friends managed to get a message to him that his wife and children had
escaped and come to England So when he deserted he came here to look
for them

Had he got their address said practical Peter

No just England He was going to London and he thought he had to
change at our station and then he found hed lost his ticket and his
purse

Oh DO you think hell find themI mean his wife and children not
the ticket and things

I hope so Oh I hope and pray that hell find his wife and children
again

Even Phyllis now perceived that mothers voice was very unsteady

Why Mother she said how very sorry you seem to be for him

Mother didnt answer for a minute Then she just said Yes and then
she seemed to be thinking The children were quiet

Presently she said Dears when you say your prayers I think you might
ask God to show His pity upon all prisoners and captives

To show His pity Bobbie repeated slowly upon all prisoners and
captives Is that right Mother

Yes said Mother upon all prisoners and captives All prisoners and
captives



Chapter VI Saviours of the train


The Russian gentleman was better the next day and the day after that
better still and on the third day he was well enough to come into the
garden A basket chair was put for him and he sat there dressed in
clothes of Fathers which were too big for him But when Mother had
hemmed up the ends of the sleeves and the trousers the clothes did
well enough His was a kind face now that it was no longer tired and
frightened and he smiled at the children whenever he saw them They
wished very much that he could speak English Mother wrote several
letters to people she thought might know whereabouts in England a
Russian gentlemans wife and family might possibly be not to the people
she used to know before she came to live at Three Chimneysshe never
wrote to any of thembut strange peopleMembers of Parliament and
Editors of papers and Secretaries of Societies

And she did not do much of her storywriting only corrected proofs as
she sat in the sun near the Russian and talked to him every now and
then

The children wanted very much to show how kindly they felt to this man
who had been sent to prison and to Siberia just for writing a beautiful
book about poor people They could smile at him of course they could
and they did But if you smile too constantly the smile is apt to
get fixed like the smile of the hyaena And then it no longer looks
friendly but simply silly So they tried other ways and brought him
flowers till the place where he sat was surrounded by little fading
bunches of clover and roses and Canterbury bells

And then Phyllis had an idea She beckoned mysteriously to the others
and drew them into the back yard and there in a concealed spot
between the pump and the waterbutt she said

You remember Perks promising me the very first strawberries out of his
own garden Perks you will recollect was the Porter Well I should
think theyre ripe now Lets go down and see

Mother had been down as she had promised to tell the Station Master the
story of the Russian Prisoner But even the charms of the railway had
been unable to tear the children away from the neighbourhood of the
interesting stranger So they had not been to the station for three
days

They went now

And to their surprise and distress were very coldly received by Perks

Ighly honoured Im sure he said when they peeped in at the door of
the Porters room And he went on reading his newspaper

There was an uncomfortable silence

Oh dear said Bobbie with a sigh I do believe youre CROSS

What me Not me said Perks loftily it aint nothing to me

What AINT nothing to you said Peter too anxious and alarmed to
change the form of words

Nothing aint nothing What appens either ere or elsewhere said
Perks if you likes to ave your secrets ave em and welcome Thats
what I say

The secretchamber of each heart was rapidly examined during the pause
that followed Three heads were shaken

We havent got any secrets from YOU said Bobbie at last

Maybe you ave and maybe you avent said Perks it aint nothing
to me And I wish you all a very good afternoon He held up the paper
between him and them and went on reading

Oh DONT said Phyllis in despair this is truly dreadful Whatever
it is do tell us

We didnt mean to do it whatever it was

No answer The paper was refolded and Perks began on another column

Look here said Peter suddenly its not fair Even people who do
crimes arent punished without being told what its foras once they
were in Russia

I dont know nothing about Russia

Oh yes you do when Mother came down on purpose to tell you and Mr
Gills all about OUR Russian

Cant you fancy it said Perks indignantly dont you see im
aasking of me to step into is room and take a chair and listen to what
er Ladyship as to say

Do you mean to say youve not heard

Not so much as a breath I did go so far as to put a question And he
shuts me up like a rattrap Affairs of State Perks says he But I
did think one o you would a nipped down to tell meyoure here sharp
enough when you want to get anything out of old PerksPhyllis
flushed purple as she thought of the strawberriesinformation about
locomotives or signals or the likes said Perks

We didnt know you didnt know

We thought Mother had told you

Wewantedtotellyouonlywethoughtitwouldbestalenews

The three spoke all at once

Perks said it was all very well and still held up the paper Then
Phyllis suddenly snatched it away and threw her arms round his neck

Oh lets kiss and be friends she said well say were sorry first
if you like but we didnt really know that you didnt know

We are so sorry said the others

And Perks at last consented to accept their apologies

Then they got him to come out and sit in the sun on the green Railway
Bank where the grass was quite hot to touch and there sometimes
speaking one at a time and sometimes all together they told the Porter
the story of the Russian Prisoner

Well I must say said Perks but he did not say itwhatever it was

Yes it is pretty awful isnt it said Peter and I dont wonder you
were curious about who the Russian was

I wasnt curious not so much as interested said the Porter

Well I do think Mr Gills might have told you about it It was horrid
of him

I dont keep no down on im for that Missie said the Porter cos
why I see is reasons E wouldnt want to give away is own side with
a tale like that ere It aint human nature A mans got to stand
up for his own side whatever they does Thats what it means by Party
Politics I should a done the same myself if that longaired chap ad
a been a Jap

But the Japs didnt do cruel wicked things like that said Bobbie

Praps not said Perks cautiously still you cant be sure with
foreigners My own belief is theyre all tarred with the same brush

Then why were you on the side of the Japs Peter asked

Well you see you must take one side or the other Same as with
Liberals and Conservatives The great thing is to take your side and
then stick to it whatever happens

A signal sounded

Theres the 314 up said Perks You lie low till shes through
and then well go up along to my place and see if theres any of them
strawberries ripe what I told you about

If there are any ripe and you DO give them to me said Phyllis you
wont mind if I give them to the poor Russian will you

Perks narrowed his eyes and then raised his eyebrows

So it was them strawberries you come down for this afternoon eh said
he

This was an awkward moment for Phyllis To say yes would seem rude and
greedy and unkind to Perks But she knew if she said no she would
not be pleased with herself afterwards So

Yes she said it was

Well done said the Porter speak the truth and shame the

But wed have come down the very next day if wed known you hadnt
heard the story Phyllis added hastily

I believe you Missie said Perks and sprang across the line six feet
in front of the advancing train

The girls hated to see him do this but Peter liked it It was so
exciting

The Russian gentleman was so delighted with the strawberries that the
three racked their brains to find some other surprise for him But all
the racking did not bring out any idea more novel than wild cherries
And this idea occurred to them next morning They had seen the blossom
on the trees in the spring and they knew where to look for wild
cherries now that cherry time was here The trees grew all up and along
the rocky face of the cliff out of which the mouth of the tunnel opened
There were all sorts of trees there birches and beeches and baby oaks
and hazels and among them the cherry blossom had shone like snow and
silver

The mouth of the tunnel was some way from Three Chimneys so Mother let
them take their lunch with them in a basket And the basket would do
to bring the cherries back in if they found any She also lent them her
silver watch so that they should not be late for tea Peters Waterbury
had taken it into its head not to go since the day when Peter dropped it
into the waterbutt And they started When they got to the top of the
cutting they leaned over the fence and looked down to where the railway
lines lay at the bottom of what as Phyllis said was exactly like a
mountain gorge

If it wasnt for the railway at the bottom it would be as though the
foot of man had never been there wouldnt it

The sides of the cutting were of grey stone very roughly hewn Indeed
the top part of the cutting had been a little natural glen that had been
cut deeper to bring it down to the level of the tunnels mouth Among
the rocks grass and flowers grew and seeds dropped by birds in the
crannies of the stone had taken root and grown into bushes and trees
that overhung the cutting Near the tunnel was a flight of steps leading
down to the linejust wooden bars roughly fixed into the eartha very
steep and narrow way more like a ladder than a stair

Wed better get down said Peter Im sure the cherries would be
quite easy to get at from the side of the steps You remember it was
there we picked the cherry blossoms that we put on the rabbits grave

So they went along the fence towards the little swing gate that is at
the top of these steps And they were almost at the gate when Bobbie
said

Hush Stop Whats that

That was a very odd noise indeeda soft noise but quite plainly to
be heard through the sound of the wind in tree branches and the hum
and whir of the telegraph wires It was a sort of rustling whispering
sound As they listened it stopped and then it began again

And this time it did not stop but it grew louder and more rustling and
rumbling

Lookcried Peter suddenlythe tree over there

The tree he pointed at was one of those that have rough grey leaves and
white flowers The berries when they come are bright scarlet but if
you pick them they disappoint you by turning black before you get them
home And as Peter pointed the tree was movingnot just the way trees
ought to move when the wind blows through them but all in one piece
as though it were a live creature and were walking down the side of the
cutting

Its moving cried Bobbie Oh look and so are the others Its like
the woods in Macbeth

Its magic said Phyllis breathlessly I always knew this railway
was enchanted

It really did seem a little like magic For all the trees for about
twenty yards of the opposite bank seemed to be slowly walking down
towards the railway line the tree with the grey leaves bringing up the
rear like some old shepherd driving a flock of green sheep

What is it Oh what is it said Phyllis its much too magic for me
I dont like it Lets go home

But Bobbie and Peter clung fast to the rail and watched breathlessly
And Phyllis made no movement towards going home by herself

The trees moved on and on Some stones and loose earth fell down and
rattled on the railway metals far below

Its ALL coming down Peter tried to say but he found there was
hardly any voice to say it with And indeed just as he spoke the
great rock on the top of which the walking trees were leaned slowly
forward The trees ceasing to walk stood still and shivered Leaning
with the rock they seemed to hesitate a moment and then rock and trees
and grass and bushes with a rushing sound slipped right away from the
face of the cutting and fell on the line with a blundering crash that
could have been heard half a mile off A cloud of dust rose up

Oh said Peter in awestruck tones isnt it exactly like when coals
come inif there wasnt any roof to the cellar and you could see
down

Look what a great mound its made said Bobbie

Yes said Peter slowly He was still leaning on the fence Yes he
said again still more slowly

Then he stood upright

The 1129 down hasnt gone by yet We must let them know at the
station or therell be a most frightful accident

Lets run said Bobbie and began

But Peter cried Come back and looked at Mothers watch He was very
prompt and businesslike and his face looked whiter than they had ever
seen it

No time he said its two miles away and its past eleven

Couldnt we suggested Phyllis breathlessly couldnt we climb up a
telegraph post and do something to the wires

We dont know how said Peter

They do it in war said Phyllis I know Ive heard of it

They only CUT them silly said Peter and that doesnt do any good
And we couldnt cut them even if we got up and we couldnt get up If
we had anything red we could get down on the line and wave it

But the train wouldnt see us till it got round the corner and then it
could see the mound just as well as us said Phyllis better because
its much bigger than us

If we only had something red Peter repeated we could go round the
corner and wave to the train

We might wave anyway

Theyd only think it was just US as usual Weve waved so often
before Anyway lets get down

They got down the steep stairs Bobbie was pale and shivering Peters
face looked thinner than usual Phyllis was redfaced and damp with
anxiety

Oh how hot I am she said and I thought it was going to be cold I
wish we hadnt put on our she stopped short and then ended in quite
a different toneour flannel petticoats

Bobbie turned at the bottom of the stairs

Oh yes she cried THEYRE red Lets take them off

They did and with the petticoats rolled up under their arms ran along
the railway skirting the newly fallen mound of stones and rock and
earth and bent crushed twisted trees They ran at their best pace
Peter led but the girls were not far behind They reached the corner
that hid the mound from the straight line of railway that ran half a
mile without curve or corner

Now said Peter taking hold of the largest flannel petticoat

Youre notPhyllis falteredyoure not going to TEAR them

Shut up said Peter with brief sternness

Oh yes said Bobbie tear them into little bits if you like Dont
you see Phil if we cant stop the train therell be a real live
accident with people KILLED Oh horrible Here Peter youll never
tear it through the band

She took the red flannel petticoat from him and tore it off an inch from
the band Then she tore the other in the same way

There said Peter tearing in his turn He divided each petticoat into
three pieces Now weve got six flags He looked at the watch again
And weve got seven minutes We must have flagstaffs

The knives given to boys are for some odd reason seldom of the kind
of steel that keeps sharp The young saplings had to be broken off Two
came up by the roots The leaves were stripped from them

We must cut holes in the flags and run the sticks through the holes
said Peter And the holes were cut The knife was sharp enough to cut
flannel with Two of the flags were set up in heaps of loose stones
between the sleepers of the down line Then Phyllis and Roberta took
each a flag and stood ready to wave it as soon as the train came in
sight

I shall have the other two myself said Peter because it was my idea
to wave something red

Theyre our petticoats though Phyllis was beginning but Bobbie
interrupted

Oh what does it matter who waves what if we can only save the train

Perhaps Peter had not rightly calculated the number of minutes it would
take the 1129 to get from the station to the place where they were or
perhaps the train was late Anyway it seemed a very long time that they
waited

Phyllis grew impatient I expect the watch is wrong and the trains
gone by said she

Peter relaxed the heroic attitude he had chosen to show off his two
flags And Bobbie began to feel sick with suspense

It seemed to her that they had been standing there for hours and hours
holding those silly little red flannel flags that no one would ever
notice The train wouldnt care It would go rushing by them and tear
round the corner and go crashing into that awful mound And everyone
would be killed Her hands grew very cold and trembled so that she could
hardly hold the flag And then came the distant rumble and hum of the
metals and a puff of white steam showed far away along the stretch of
line

Stand firm said Peter and wave like mad When it gets to that
big furze bush step back but go on waving Dont stand ON the line
Bobbie

The train came rattling along very very fast

They dont see us They wont see us Its all no good cried Bobbie

The two little flags on the line swayed as the nearing train shook and
loosened the heaps of loose stones that held them up One of them slowly
leaned over and fell on the line Bobbie jumped forward and caught it
up and waved it her hands did not tremble now

It seemed that the train came on as fast as ever It was very near now

Keep off the line you silly cuckoo said Peter fiercely

Its no good Bobbie said again

Stand back cried Peter suddenly and he dragged Phyllis back by the
arm

But Bobbie cried Not yet not yet and waved her two flags right over
the line The front of the engine looked black and enormous Its voice
was loud and harsh

Oh stop stop stop cried Bobbie No one heard her At least Peter
and Phyllis didnt for the oncoming rush of the train covered the sound
of her voice with a mountain of sound But afterwards she used to wonder
whether the engine itself had not heard her It seemed almost as though
it hadfor it slackened swiftly slackened and stopped not twenty
yards from the place where Bobbies two flags waved over the line She
saw the great black engine stop dead but somehow she could not stop
waving the flags And when the driver and the fireman had got off the
engine and Peter and Phyllis had gone to meet them and pour out their
excited tale of the awful mound just round the corner Bobbie still
waved the flags but more and more feebly and jerkily

When the others turned towards her she was lying across the line with
her hands flung forward and still gripping the sticks of the little red
flannel flags

The enginedriver picked her up carried her to the train and laid her
on the cushions of a firstclass carriage

Gone right off in a faint he said poor little woman And no wonder
Ill just ave a look at this ere mound of yours and then well run
you back to the station and get her seen to

It was horrible to see Bobbie lying so white and quiet with her lips
blue and parted

I believe thats what people look like when theyre dead whispered
Phyllis

DONT said Peter sharply

They sat by Bobbie on the blue cushions and the train ran back Before
it reached their station Bobbie had sighed and opened her eyes
and rolled herself over and begun to cry This cheered the others
wonderfully They had seen her cry before but they had never seen her
faint nor anyone else for the matter of that They had not known what
to do when she was fainting but now she was only crying they could
thump her on the back and tell her not to just as they always did And
presently when she stopped crying they were able to laugh at her for
being such a coward as to faint

When the station was reached the three were the heroes of an agitated
meeting on the platform

The praises they got for their prompt action their common sense
their ingenuity were enough to have turned anybodys head Phyllis
enjoyed herself thoroughly She had never been a real heroine before
and the feeling was delicious Peters ears got very red Yet he too
enjoyed himself Only Bobbie wished they all wouldnt She wanted to get
away

Youll hear from the Company about this I expect said the Station
Master

Bobbie wished she might never hear of it again She pulled at Peters
jacket

Oh come away come away I want to go home she said

So they went And as they went Station Master and Porter and guards and
driver and fireman and passengers sent up a cheer

Oh listen cried Phyllis thats for US

Yes said Peter I say I am glad I thought about something red and
waving it

How lucky we DID put on our red flannel petticoats said Phyllis

Bobbie said nothing She was thinking of the horrible mound and the
trustful train rushing towards it

And it was US that saved them said Peter

How dreadful if they had all been killed said Phyllis wouldnt it
Bobbie

We never got any cherries after all said Bobbie

The others thought her rather heartless



Chapter VII For valour


I hope you dont mind my telling you a good deal about Roberta The fact
is I am growing very fond of her The more I observe her the more I love
her And I notice all sorts of things about her that I like

For instance she was quite oddly anxious to make other people happy
And she could keep a secret a tolerably rare accomplishment Also she
had the power of silent sympathy That sounds rather dull I know but
its not so dull as it sounds It just means that a person is able
to know that you are unhappy and to love you extra on that account
without bothering you by telling you all the time how sorry she is
for you That was what Bobbie was like She knew that Mother was
unhappyand that Mother had not told her the reason So she just loved
Mother more and never said a single word that could let Mother know how
earnestly her little girl wondered what Mother was unhappy about This
needs practice It is not so easy as you might think

Whatever happenedand all sorts of nice pleasant ordinary things
happenedsuch as picnics games and buns for tea Bobbie always had
these thoughts at the back of her mind Mothers unhappy Why I dont
know She doesnt want me to know I wont try to find out But she
IS unhappy Why I dont know She doesnt and so on repeating and
repeating like a tune that you dont know the stopping part of

The Russian gentleman still took up a good deal of everybodys thoughts
All the editors and secretaries of Societies and Members of Parliament
had answered Mothers letters as politely as they knew how but none of
them could tell where the wife and children of Mr Szezcpansky would be
likely to be Did I tell you that the Russians very Russian name was
that

Bobbie had another quality which you will hear differently described
by different people Some of them call it interfering in other peoples
businessand some call it helping lame dogs over stiles and some
call it lovingkindness It just means trying to help people

She racked her brains to think of some way of helping the Russian
gentleman to find his wife and children He had learned a few words
of English now He could say Good morning and Good night and
Please and Thank you and Pretty when the children brought him
flowers and Ver good when they asked him how he had slept

The way he smiled when he said his English was Bobbie felt just
too sweet for anything She used to think of his face because she
fancied it would help her to some way of helping him But it did not
Yet his being there cheered her because she saw that it made Mother
happier

She likes to have someone to be good to even beside us said Bobbie
And I know she hated to let him have Fathers clothes But I suppose it
hurt nice or she wouldnt have

For many and many a night after the day when she and Peter and Phyllis
had saved the train from wreck by waving their little red flannel flags
Bobbie used to wake screaming and shivering seeing again that horrible
mound and the poor dear trustful engine rushing on towards itjust
thinking that it was doing its swift duty and that everything was clear
and safe And then a warm thrill of pleasure used to run through her
at the remembrance of how she and Peter and Phyllis and the red flannel
petticoats had really saved everybody

One morning a letter came It was addressed to Peter and Bobbie and
Phyllis They opened it with enthusiastic curiosity for they did not
often get letters

The letter said

Dear Sir and LadiesIt is proposed to make a small presentation to
you in commemoration of your prompt and courageous action in warning
the train on the  inst and thus averting what must humanly
speaking have been a terrible accident The presentation will take
place at the  Station at three oclock on the 30th inst if this
time and place will be convenient to you

 Yours faithfully

 Jabez Inglewood
Secretary Great Northern and Southern Railway Co

There never had been a prouder moment in the lives of the three
children They rushed to Mother with the letter and she also felt proud
and said so and this made the children happier than ever

But if the presentation is money you must say Thank you but wed
rather not take it said Mother Ill wash your Indian muslins at
once she added You must look tidy on an occasion like this

Phil and I can wash them said Bobbie if youll iron them Mother

Washing is rather fun I wonder whether youve ever done it This
particular washing took place in the back kitchen which had a stone
floor and a very big stone sink under its window

Lets put the bath on the sink said Phyllis then we can pretend
were outofdoors washerwomen like Mother saw in France

But they were washing in the cold river said Peter his hands in his
pockets not in hot water

This is a HOT river then said Phyllis lend a hand with the bath
theres a dear

I should like to see a deer lending a hand said Peter but he lent
his

Now to rub and scrub and scrub and rub said Phyllis hopping joyously
about as Bobbie carefully carried the heavy kettle from the kitchen
fire

Oh no said Bobbie greatly shocked you dont rub muslin You put
the boiled soap in the hot water and make it all frothylatheryand
then you shake the muslin and squeeze it ever so gently and all the
dirt comes out Its only clumsy things like tablecloths and sheets that
have to be rubbed

The lilac and the Gloire de Dijon roses outside the window swayed in the
soft breeze

Its a nice drying daythats one thing said Bobbie feeling very
grown up Oh I do wonder what wonderful feelings we shall have when we
WEAR the Indian muslin dresses

Yes so do I said Phyllis shaking and squeezing the muslin in quite
a professional manner

NOW we squeeze out the soapy water NOwe mustnt twist themand then
rinse them Ill hold them while you and Peter empty the bath and get
clean water

A presentation That means presents said Peter as his sisters
having duly washed the pegs and wiped the line hung up the dresses to
dry Whatever will it be

It might be anything said Phyllis what Ive always wanted is a Baby
elephantbut I suppose they wouldnt know that

Suppose it was gold models of steamengines said Bobbie

Or a big model of the scene of the prevented accident suggested
Peter with a little model train and dolls dressed like us and the
enginedriver and fireman and passengers

Do you LIKE said Bobbie doubtfully drying her hands on the rough
towel that hung on a roller at the back of the scullery door do you
LIKE us being rewarded for saving a train

Yes I do said Peter downrightly and dont you try to come it over
us that you dont like it too Because I know you do

Yes said Bobbie doubtfully I know I do But oughtnt we to be
satisfied with just having done it and not ask for anything more

Who did ask for anything more silly said her brother Victoria
Cross soldiers dont ASK for it but theyre glad enough to get it all
the same Perhaps itll be medals Then when Im very old indeed I
shall show them to my grandchildren and say We only did our duty and
theyll be awfully proud of me

You have to be married warned Phyllis or you dont have any
grandchildren

I suppose I shall HAVE to be married some day said Peter but it
will be an awful bother having her round all the time Id like to marry
a lady who had trances and only woke up once or twice a year

Just to say you were the light of her life and then go to sleep again
Yes That wouldnt be bad said Bobbie

When _I_ get married said Phyllis I shall want him to want me to be
awake all the time so that I can hear him say how nice I am

I think it would be nice said Bobbie to marry someone very poor
and then youd do all the work and hed love you most frightfully and
see the blue wood smoke curling up among the trees from the domestic
hearth as he came home from work every night I sayweve got to answer
that letter and say that the time and place WILL be convenient to us
Theres the soap Peter WERE both as clean as clean That pink box of
writing paper you had on your birthday Phil

It took some time to arrange what should be said Mother had gone back
to her writing and several sheets of pink paper with scalloped gilt
edges and green fourleaved shamrocks in the corner were spoiled before
the three had decided what to say Then each made a copy and signed it
with its own name

The threefold letter ran

Dear Mr Jabez InglewoodThank you very much We did not want to be
rewarded but only to save the train but we are glad you think so and
thank you very much The time and place you say will be quite convenient
to us Thank you very much

 Your affecate little friend

Then came the name and after it

PS Thank you very much

Washing is much easier than ironing said Bobbie taking the clean dry
dresses off the line I do love to see things come clean OhI dont
know how we shall wait till its time to know what presentation theyre
going to present

When at lastit seemed a very long time afterit was THE day
the three children went down to the station at the proper time And
everything that happened was so odd that it seemed like a dream The
Station Master came out to meet themin his best clothes as Peter
noticed at onceand led them into the waiting room where once they had
played the advertisement game It looked quite different now A carpet
had been put downand there were pots of roses on the mantelpiece and
on the window ledgesgreen branches stuck up like holly and laurel
are at Christmas over the framed advertisement of Cooks Tours and the
Beauties of Devon and the Paris Lyons Railway There were quite a
number of people there besides the Portertwo or three ladies in
smart dresses and quite a crowd of gentlemen in high hats and frock
coatsbesides everybody who belonged to the station They recognized
several people who had been in the train on the redflannelpetticoat
day Best of all their own old gentleman was there and his coat and hat
and collar seemed more than ever different from anyone elses He shook
hands with them and then everybody sat down on chairs and a gentleman
in spectaclesthey found out afterwards that he was the District
Superintendentbegan quite a long speechvery clever indeed I am not
going to write the speech down First because you would think it dull
and secondly because it made all the children blush so and get so hot
about the ears that I am quite anxious to get away from this part of the
subject and thirdly because the gentleman took so many words to say
what he had to say that I really havent time to write them down He
said all sorts of nice things about the childrens bravery and presence
of mind and when he had done he sat down and everyone who was there
clapped and said Hear hear

And then the old gentleman got up and said things too It was very like
a prizegiving And then he called the children one by one by their
names and gave each of them a beautiful gold watch and chain And
inside the watches were engraved after the name of the watchs new
owner

From the Directors of the Northern and Southern Railway in grateful
recognition of the courageous and prompt action which averted an
accident on  1905

The watches were the most beautiful you can possibly imagine and each
one had a blue leather case to live in when it was at home

You must make a speech now and thank everyone for their kindness
whispered the Station Master in Peters ear and pushed him forward
Begin Ladies and Gentlemen he added

Each of the children had already said Thank you quite properly

Oh dear said Peter but he did not resist the push

Ladies and Gentlemen he said in a rather husky voice Then there
was a pause and he heard his heart beating in his throat Ladies and
Gentlemen he went on with a rush its most awfully good of you and
we shall treasure the watches all our livesbut really we dont deserve
it because what we did wasnt anything really At least I mean it
was awfully exciting and what I mean to saythank you all very very
much

The people clapped Peter more than they had done the District
Superintendent and then everybody shook hands with them and as soon as
politeness would let them they got away and tore up the hill to Three
Chimneys with their watches in their hands

It was a wonderful daythe kind of day that very seldom happens to
anybody and to most of us not at all

I did want to talk to the old gentleman about something else said
Bobbie but it was so publiclike being in church

What did you want to say asked Phyllis

Ill tell you when Ive thought about it more said Bobbie

So when she had thought a little more she wrote a letter

My dearest old gentleman it said I want most awfully to ask you
something If you could get out of the train and go by the next it
would do I do not want you to give me anything Mother says we ought
not to And besides we do not want any THINGS Only to talk to you
about a Prisoner and Captive Your loving little friend

 Bobbie

She got the Station Master to give the letter to the old gentleman and
next day she asked Peter and Phyllis to come down to the station with
her at the time when the train that brought the old gentleman from town
would be passing through

She explained her idea to themand they approved thoroughly

They had all washed their hands and faces and brushed their hair and
were looking as tidy as they knew how But Phyllis always unlucky had
upset a jug of lemonade down the front of her dress There was no time
to changeand the wind happening to blow from the coal yard her frock
was soon powdered with grey which stuck to the sticky lemonade stains
and made her look as Peter said like any little gutter child

It was decided that she should keep behind the others as much as
possible

Perhaps the old gentleman wont notice said Bobbie The aged are
often weak in the eyes

There was no sign of weakness however in the eyes or in any other
part of the old gentleman as he stepped from the train and looked up
and down the platform

The three children now that it came to the point suddenly felt that
rush of deep shyness which makes your ears red and hot your hands warm
and wet and the tip of your nose pink and shiny

Oh said Phyllis my hearts thumping like a steamengineright
under my sash too

Nonsense said Peter peoples hearts arent under their sashes

I dont caremine is said Phyllis

If youre going to talk like a poetrybook said Peter my hearts in
my mouth

My hearts in my bootsif you come to that said Roberta but do
come onhell think were idiots

He wont be far wrong said Peter gloomily And they went forward to
meet the old gentleman

Hullo he said shaking hands with them all in turn This is a very
great pleasure

It WAS good of you to get out Bobbie said perspiring and polite

He took her arm and drew her into the waiting room where she and the
others had played the advertisement game the day they found the Russian
Phyllis and Peter followed Well said the old gentleman giving
Bobbies arm a kind little shake before he let it go Well What is
it

Oh please said Bobbie

Yes said the old gentleman

What I mean to say said Bobbie

Well said the old gentleman

Its all very nice and kind said she

But he said

I wish I might say something she said

Say it said he

Well then said Bobbieand out came the story of the Russian who
had written the beautiful book about poor people and had been sent to
prison and to Siberia for just that

And what we want more than anything in the world is to find his wife
and children for him said Bobbie but we dont know how But you must
be most horribly clever or you wouldnt be a Direction of the Railway
And if YOU knew howand would Wed rather have that than anything else
in the world Wed go without the watches even if you could sell them
and find his wife with the money

And the others said so too though not with so much enthusiasm

Hum said the old gentleman pulling down the white waistcoat that
had the big gilt buttons on it what did you say the name
wasFryingpansky

No no said Bobbie earnestly Ill write it down for you It doesnt
really look at all like that except when you say it Have you a bit of
pencil and the back of an envelope she asked

The old gentleman got out a gold pencilcase and a beautiful
sweetsmelling green Russian leather notebook and opened it at a new
page

Here he said write here

She wrote down Szezcpansky and said

Thats how you write it You CALL it Shepansky

The old gentleman took out a pair of goldrimmed spectacles and fitted
them on his nose When he had read the name he looked quite different

THAT man Bless my soul he said Why Ive read his book Its
translated into every European language A fine booka noble book And
so your mother took him inlike the good Samaritan Well well Ill
tell you what youngstersyour mother must be a very good woman

Of course she is said Phyllis in astonishment

And youre a very good man said Bobbie very shy but firmly resolved
to be polite

You flatter me said the old gentleman taking off his hat with a
flourish And now am I to tell you what I think of you

Oh please dont said Bobbie hastily

Why asked the old gentleman

I dont exactly know said Bobbie Onlyif its horrid I dont want
you to and if its nice Id rather you didnt

The old gentleman laughed

Well then he said Ill only just say that Im very glad you came
to me about thisvery glad indeed And I shouldnt be surprised if I
found out something very soon I know a great many Russians in London
and every Russian knows HIS name Now tell me all about yourselves

He turned to the others but there was only one other and that was
Peter Phyllis had disappeared

Tell me all about yourself said the old gentleman again And quite
naturally Peter was stricken dumb

All right well have an examination said the old gentleman you two
sit on the table and Ill sit on the bench and ask questions

He did and out came their names and agestheir Fathers name and
businesshow long they had lived at Three Chimneys and a great deal
more

The questions were beginning to turn on a herring and a half for three
halfpence and a pound of lead and a pound of feathers when the door of
the waiting room was kicked open by a boot as the boot entered everyone
could see that its lace was coming undoneand in came Phyllis very
slowly and carefully

In one hand she carried a large tin can and in the other a thick slice
of bread and butter

Afternoon tea she announced proudly and held the can and the bread
and butter out to the old gentleman who took them and said

Bless my soul

Yes said Phyllis

Its very thoughtful of you said the old gentleman very

But you might have got a cup said Bobbie and a plate

Perks always drinks out of the can said Phyllis flushing red I
think it was very nice of him to give it me at alllet alone cups and
plates she added

So do I said the old gentleman and he drank some of the tea and
tasted the bread and butter

And then it was time for the next train and he got into it with many
goodbyes and kind last words

Well said Peter when they were left on the platform and the
taillights of the train disappeared round the corner its my belief
that weve lighted a candle todaylike Latimer you know when he was
being burnedand therell be fireworks for our Russian before long

And so there were

It wasnt ten days after the interview in the waiting room that the
three children were sitting on the top of the biggest rock in the field
below their house watching the 515 steam away from the station along
the bottom of the valley They saw too the few people who had got out
at the station straggling up the road towards the villageand they saw
one person leave the road and open the gate that led across the fields
to Three Chimneys and to nowhere else

Who on earth said Peter scrambling down

Lets go and see said Phyllis

So they did And when they got near enough to see who the person was
they saw it was their old gentleman himself his brass buttons winking
in the afternoon sunshine and his white waistcoat looking whiter than
ever against the green of the field

Hullo shouted the children waving their hands

Hullo shouted the old gentleman waving his hat

Then the three started to runand when they got to him they hardly had
breath left to say

How do you do

Good news said he Ive found your Russian friends wife and
childand I couldnt resist the temptation of giving myself the
pleasure of telling him

But as he looked at Bobbies face he felt that he COULD resist that
temptation

Here he said to her you run on and tell him The other two will
show me the way

Bobbie ran But when she had breathlessly panted out the news to the
Russian and Mother sitting in the quiet gardenwhen Mothers face had
lighted up so beautifully and she had said half a dozen quick French
words to the ExileBobbie wished that she had NOT carried the news For
the Russian sprang up with a cry that made Bobbies heart leap and then
tremblea cry of love and longing such as she had never heard Then he
took Mothers hand and kissed it gently and reverentlyand then he sank
down in his chair and covered his face with his hands and sobbed Bobbie
crept away She did not want to see the others just then

But she was as gay as anybody when the endless French talking was over
when Peter had torn down to the village for buns and cakes and the
girls had got tea ready and taken it out into the garden

The old gentleman was most merry and delightful He seemed to be able
to talk in French and English almost at the same moment and Mother did
nearly as well It was a delightful time Mother seemed as if she could
not make enough fuss about the old gentleman and she said yes at once
when he asked if he might present some goodies to his little friends

The word was new to the childrenbut they guessed that it meant sweets
for the three large pink and green boxes tied with green ribbon which
he took out of his bag held unheardof layers of beautiful chocolates

The Russians few belongings were packed and they all saw him off at
the station

Then Mother turned to the old gentleman and said

I dont know how to thank you for EVERYTHING It has been a real
pleasure to me to see you But we live very quietly I am so sorry that
I cant ask you to come and see us again

The children thought this very hard When they HAD made a friendand
such a friendthey would dearly have liked him to come and see them
again

What the old gentleman thought they couldnt tell He only said

I consider myself very fortunate Madam to have been received once at
your house

Ah said Mother I know I must seem surly and ungratefulbut

You could never seem anything but a most charming and gracious lady
said the old gentleman with another of his bows

And as they turned to go up the hill Bobbie saw her Mothers face

How tired you look Mammy she said lean on me

Its my place to give Mother my arm said Peter Im the head man of
the family when Fathers away

Mother took an arm of each

How awfully nice said Phyllis skipping joyfully to think of the
dear Russian embracing his longlost wife The baby must have grown a
lot since he saw it

Yes said Mother

I wonder whether Father will think IVE grown Phyllis went on
skipping still more gaily I have grown already havent I Mother

Yes said Mother oh yes and Bobbie and Peter felt her hands
tighten on their arms

Poor old Mammy you ARE tired said Peter

Bobbie said Come on Phil Ill race you to the gate

And she started the race though she hated doing it YOU know why Bobbie
did that Mother only thought that Bobbie was tired of walking slowly
Even Mothers who love you better than anyone else ever will dont
always understand



Chapter VIII The amateur firemen


Thats a likely little brooch youve got on Miss said Perks the
Porter I dont know as ever I see a thing more like a buttercup
without it WAS a buttercup

Yes said Bobbie glad and flushed by this approval I always thought
it was more like a buttercup almost than even a real oneand I NEVER
thought it would come to be mine my very ownand then Mother gave it
to me for my birthday

Oh have you had a birthday said Perks and he seemed quite
surprised as though a birthday were a thing only granted to a favoured
few

Yes said Bobbie whens your birthday Mr Perks The children were
taking tea with Mr Perks in the Porters room among the lamps and
the railway almanacs They had brought their own cups and some jam
turnovers Mr Perks made tea in a beer can as usual and everyone felt
very happy and confidential

My birthday said Perks tipping some more dark brown tea out of the
can into Peters cup I give up keeping of my birthday afore you was
born

But you must have been born SOMETIME you know said Phyllis
thoughtfully even if it was twenty years agoor thirty or sixty or
seventy

Not so long as that Missie Perks grinned as he answered If you
really want to know it was thirtytwo years ago come the fifteenth of
this month

Then why dont you keep it asked Phyllis

Ive got something else to keep besides birthdays said Perks
briefly

Oh What asked Phyllis eagerly Not secrets

No said Perks the kids and the Missus

It was this talk that set the children thinking and presently
talking Perks was on the whole the dearest friend they had made Not
so grand as the Station Master but more approachableless powerful
than the old gentleman but more confidential

It seems horrid that nobody keeps his birthday said Bobbie Couldnt
WE do something

Lets go up to the Canal bridge and talk it over said Peter I got a
new gut line from the postman this morning He gave it me for a bunch of
roses that I gave him for his sweetheart Shes ill

Then I do think you might have given her the roses for nothing said
Bobbie indignantly

Nyang nyang said Peter disagreeably and put his hands in his
pockets

He did of course said Phyllis in haste directly we heard she was
ill we got the roses ready and waited by the gate It was when you were
making the brekkertoast And when hed said Thank you for the roses
so many timesmuch more than he need havehe pulled out the line and
gave it to Peter It wasnt exchange It was the grateful heart

Oh I BEG your pardon Peter said Bobbie I AM so sorry

Dont mention it said Peter grandly I knew you would be

So then they all went up to the Canal bridge The idea was to fish from
the bridge but the line was not quite long enough

Never mind said Bobbie Lets just stay here and look at things
Everythings so beautiful

It was The sun was setting in red splendour over the grey and purple
hills and the canal lay smooth and shiny in the shadowno ripple broke
its surface It was like a grey satin ribbon between the dusky green
silk of the meadows that were on each side of its banks

Its all right said Peter but somehow I can always see how pretty
things are much better when Ive something to do Lets get down on to
the towpath and fish from there

Phyllis and Bobbie remembered how the boys on the canalboats had thrown
coal at them and they said so

Oh nonsense said Peter There arent any boys here now If there
were Id fight them

Peters sisters were kind enough not to remind him how he had NOT fought
the boys when coal had last been thrown Instead they said All right
then and cautiously climbed down the steep bank to the towingpath
The line was carefully baited and for half an hour they fished
patiently and in vain Not a single nibble came to nourish hope in their
hearts

All eyes were intent on the sluggish waters that earnestly pretended
they had never harboured a single minnow when a loud rough shout made
them start

Hi said the shout in most disagreeable tones get out of that
cant you

An old white horse coming along the towingpath was within half a dozen
yards of them They sprang to their feet and hastily climbed up the
bank

Well slip down again when theyve gone by said Bobbie

But alas the barge after the manner of barges stopped under the
bridge

Shes going to anchor said Peter just our luck

The barge did not anchor because an anchor is not part of a
canalboats furniture but she was moored with ropes fore and aftand
the ropes were made fast to the palings and to crowbars driven into the
ground

What you staring at growled the Bargee crossly

We werent staring said Bobbie we wouldnt be so rude

Rude be blessed said the man get along with you

Get along yourself said Peter He remembered what he had said about
fighting boys and besides he felt safe halfway up the bank Weve as
much right here as anyone else

Oh AVE you indeed said the man Well soon see about that And
he came across his deck and began to climb down the side of his barge

Oh come away Peter come away said Bobbie and Phyllis in agonised
unison

Not me said Peter but YOUD better

The girls climbed to the top of the bank and stood ready to bolt for
home as soon as they saw their brother out of danger The way home lay
all down hill They knew that they all ran well The Bargee did not look
as if HE did He was redfaced heavy and beefy

But as soon as his foot was on the towingpath the children saw that
they had misjudged him

He made one spring up the bank and caught Peter by the leg dragged him
downset him on his feet with a shaketook him by the earand said
sternly

Now then what do you mean by it Dont you know these ere waters is
preserved You aint no right catching fish erenot to say nothing of
your precious cheek

Peter was always proud afterwards when he remembered that with the
Bargees furious fingers tightening on his ear the Bargees crimson
countenance close to his own the Bargees hot breath on his neck he
had the courage to speak the truth

I WASNT catching fish said Peter

Thats not YOUR fault Ill be bound said the man giving Peters ear
a twistnot a hard onebut still a twist

Peter could not say that it was Bobbie and Phyllis had been holding
on to the railings above and skipping with anxiety Now suddenly Bobbie
slipped through the railings and rushed down the bank towards Peter so
impetuously that Phyllis following more temperately felt certain that
her sisters descent would end in the waters of the canal And so it
would have done if the Bargee hadnt let go of Peters earand caught
her in his jerseyed arm

Who are you ashoving of he said setting her on her feet

Oh said Bobbie breathless Im not shoving anybody At least not
on purpose Please dont be cross with Peter Of course if its your
canal were sorry and we wont any more But we didnt know it was
yours

Go along with you said the Bargee

Yes we will indeed we will said Bobbie earnestly but we do beg
your pardonand really we havent caught a single fish Id tell you
directly if we had honour bright I would

She held out her hands and Phyllis turned out her little empty pocket to
show that really they hadnt any fish concealed about them

Well said the Bargee more gently cut along then and dont you do
it again thats all

The children hurried up the bank

Chuck us a coat Mria shouted the man And a redhaired woman in a
green plaid shawl came out from the cabin door with a baby in her arms
and threw a coat to him He put it on climbed the bank and slouched
along across the bridge towards the village

Youll find me up at the Rose and Crown when youve got the kid to
sleep he called to her from the bridge

When he was out of sight the children slowly returned Peter insisted on
this

The canal may belong to him he said though I dont believe it
does But the bridge is everybodys Doctor Forrest told me its public
property Im not going to be bounced off the bridge by him or anyone
else so I tell you

Peters ear was still sore and so were his feelings

The girls followed him as gallant soldiers might follow the leader of a
forlorn hope

I do wish you wouldnt was all they said

Go home if youre afraid said Peter leave me alone IM not
afraid

The sound of the mans footsteps died away along the quiet road The
peace of the evening was not broken by the notes of the sedgewarblers
or by the voice of the woman in the barge singing her baby to sleep It
was a sad song she sang Something about Bill Bailey and how she wanted
him to come home

The children stood leaning their arms on the parapet of the bridge they
were glad to be quiet for a few minutes because all three hearts were
beating much more quickly

Im not going to be driven away by any old bargeman Im not said
Peter thickly

Of course not Phyllis said soothingly you didnt give in to him So
now we might go home dont you think

NO said Peter

Nothing more was said till the woman got off the barge climbed the
bank and came across the bridge

She hesitated looking at the three backs of the children then she
said Ahem

Peter stayed as he was but the girls looked round

You mustnt take no notice of my Bill said the woman is barks
worsen is bite Some of the kids down Farley way is fair terrors It
was them put is back up calling out about who ate the puppypie under
Marlow bridge

Who DID asked Phyllis

_I_ dunno said the woman Nobody dont know But somehow and I
dont know the why nor the wherefore of it them words is pison to a
bargemaster Dont you take no notice E wont be back for two hours
good You might catch a power o fish afore that The lights good an
all she added

Thank you said Bobbie Youre very kind Wheres your baby

Asleep in the cabin said the woman Es all right Never wakes
afore twelve Reglar as a church clock e is

Im sorry said Bobbie I would have liked to see him close to

And a finer you never did see Miss though I says it The womans
face brightened as she spoke

Arent you afraid to leave it said Peter

Lor love you no said the woman whod hurt a little thing like
im Besides Spots there So long

The woman went away

Shall we go home said Phyllis

You can Im going to fish said Peter briefly

I thought we came up here to talk about Perkss birthday said
Phyllis

Perkss birthdayll keep

So they got down on the towingpath again and Peter fished He did not
catch anything

It was almost quite dark the girls were getting tired and as Bobbie
said it was past bedtime when suddenly Phyllis cried Whats that

And she pointed to the canal boat Smoke was coming from the chimney of
the cabin had indeed been curling softly into the soft evening air all
the timebut now other wreaths of smoke were rising and these were
from the cabin door

Its on firethats all said Peter calmly Serve him right

Ohhow CAN you cried Phyllis Think of the poor dear dog

The BABY screamed Bobbie

In an instant all three made for the barge

Her mooring ropes were slack and the little breeze hardly strong
enough to be felt had yet been strong enough to drift her stern against
the bank Bobbie was firstthen came Peter and it was Peter who
slipped and fell He went into the canal up to his neck and his feet
could not feel the bottom but his arm was on the edge of the barge
Phyllis caught at his hair It hurt but it helped him to get out Next
minute he had leaped on to the barge Phyllis following

Not you he shouted to Bobbie ME because Im wet

He caught up with Bobbie at the cabin door and flung her aside very
roughly indeed if they had been playing such roughness would have made
Bobbie weep with tears of rage and pain Now though he flung her on
to the edge of the hold so that her knee and her elbow were grazed and
bruised she only cried

Nonot youME and struggled up again But not quickly enough

Peter had already gone down two of the cabin steps into the cloud of
thick smoke He stopped remembered all he had ever heard of fires
pulled his soaked handkerchief out of his breast pocket and tied it over
his mouth As he pulled it out he said

Its all right hardly any fire at all

And this though he thought it was a lie was rather good of Peter It
was meant to keep Bobbie from rushing after him into danger Of course
it didnt

The cabin glowed red A paraffin lamp was burning calmly in an orange
mist

Hi said Peter lifting the handkerchief from his mouth for a moment
Hi Babywhere are you He choked

Oh let ME go cried Bobbie close behind him Peter pushed her back
more roughly than before and went on

Now what would have happened if the baby hadnt cried I dont knowbut
just at that moment it DID cry Peter felt his way through the dark
smoke found something small and soft and warm and alive picked it up
and backed out nearly tumbling over Bobbie who was close behind A dog
snapped at his legtried to bark choked

Ive got the kid said Peter tearing off the handkerchief and
staggering on to the deck

Bobbie caught at the place where the bark came from and her hands met
on the fat back of a smoothhaired dog It turned and fastened its teeth
on her hand but very gently as much as to say

Im bound to bark and bite if strangers come into my masters cabin
but I know you mean well so I wont REALLY bite

Bobbie dropped the dog

All right old man Good dog said she Heregive me the baby
Peter youre so wet youll give it cold

Peter was only too glad to hand over the strange little bundle that
squirmed and whimpered in his arms

Now said Bobbie quickly you run straight to the Rose and Crown
and tell them Phil and I will stay here with the precious Hush then
a dear a duck a darling Go NOW Peter Run

I cant run in these things said Peter firmly theyre as heavy as
lead Ill walk

Then ILL run said Bobbie Get on the bank Phil and Ill hand you
the dear

The baby was carefully handed Phyllis sat down on the bank and tried to
hush the baby Peter wrung the water from his sleeves and knickerbocker
legs as well as he could and it was Bobbie who ran like the wind across
the bridge and up the long white quiet twilight road towards the Rose
and Crown

There is a nice oldfashioned room at the Rose and Crown where Bargees
and their wives sit of an evening drinking their supper beer and
toasting their supper cheese at a glowing basketful of coals that
sticks out into the room under a great hooded chimney and is warmer and
prettier and more comforting than any other fireplace _I_ ever saw

There was a pleasant party of barge people round the fire You might
not have thought it pleasant but they did for they were all friends
or acquaintances and they liked the same sort of things and talked
the same sort of talk This is the real secret of pleasant society The
Bargee Bill whom the children had found so disagreeable was considered
excellent company by his mates He was telling a tale of his own
wrongsalways a thrilling subject It was his barge he was speaking
about

And e sent down word paint her inside hout not namin no colour
dye see So I gets a lotter green paint and I paints her stem to stern
and I tell yer she looked A1 Then E comes along and e says Wot yer
paint er all one colour for e says And I says says I Cause I
thought shed look fustrate says I and I think so still An he
says DEW yer Then ye can just pay for the bloomin paint yerself
says he An I ad to too A murmur of sympathy ran round the
room Breaking noisily in on it came Bobbie She burst open the swing
doorcrying breathlessly

Bill I want Bill the Bargeman

There was a stupefied silence Pots of beer were held in midair
paralysed on their way to thirsty mouths

Oh said Bobbie seeing the bargewoman and making for her Your barge
cabins on fire Go quickly

The woman started to her feet and put a big red hand to her waist on
the left side where your heart seems to be when you are frightened or
miserable

Reginald Horace she cried in a terrible voice my Reginald Horace

All right said Bobbie if you mean the baby got him out safe Dog
too She had no breath for more except Go onits all alight

Then she sank on the alehouse bench and tried to get that breath of
relief after running which people call the second wind But she felt
as though she would never breathe again

Bill the Bargee rose slowly and heavily But his wife was a hundred
yards up the road before he had quite understood what was the matter

Phyllis shivering by the canal side had hardly heard the quick
approaching feet before the woman had flung herself on the railing
rolled down the bank and snatched the baby from her

Dont said Phyllis reproachfully Id just got him to sleep

      

Bill came up later talking in a language with which the children were
wholly unfamiliar He leaped on to the barge and dipped up pails
of water Peter helped him and they put out the fire Phyllis the
bargewoman and the babyand presently Bobbie toocuddled together in
a heap on the bank

Lord help me if it was me left anything as could catch alight said
the woman again and again

But it wasnt she It was Bill the Bargeman who had knocked his pipe
out and the red ash had fallen on the hearthrug and smouldered there
and at last broken into flame Though a stern man he was just He did
not blame his wife for what was his own fault as many bargemen and
other men too would have done

      

Mother was half wild with anxiety when at last the three children turned
up at Three Chimneys all very wet by now for Peter seemed to have come
off on the others But when she had disentangled the truth of what had
happened from their mixed and incoherent narrative she owned that they
had done quite right and could not possibly have done otherwise Nor
did she put any obstacles in the way of their accepting the cordial
invitation with which the bargeman had parted from them

Ye be here at seven tomorrow he had said and Ill take you the
entire trip to Farley and back so I will and not a penny to pay
Nineteen locks

They did not know what locks were but they were at the bridge at seven
with bread and cheese and half a soda cake and quite a quarter of a leg
of mutton in a basket

It was a glorious day The old white horse strained at the ropes the
barge glided smoothly and steadily through the still water The sky was
blue overhead Mr Bill was as nice as anyone could possibly be No one
would have thought that he could be the same man who had held Peter by
the ear As for Mrs Bill she had always been nice as Bobbie said and
so had the baby and even Spot who might have bitten them quite badly
if he had liked

It was simply ripping Mother said Peter when they reached home very
happy very tired and very dirty right over that glorious aqueduct
And locksyou dont know what theyre like You sink into the ground
and then when you feel youre never going to stop going down two great
black gates open slowly slowlyyou go out and there you are on the
canal just like you were before

I know said Mother there are locks on the Thames Father and I used
to go on the river at Marlow before we were married

And the dear darling ducky baby said Bobbie it let me nurse it
for ages and agesand it WAS so good Mother I wish we had a baby to
play with

And everybody was so nice to us said Phyllis everybody we met And
they say we may fish whenever we like And Bill is going to show us the
way next time hes in these parts He says we dont know really

He said YOU didnt know said Peter but Mother he said hed tell
all the bargees up and down the canal that we were the real right sort
and they were to treat us like good pals as we were

So then I said Phyllis interrupted wed always each wear a red
ribbon when we went fishing by the canal so theyd know it was US and
we were the real right sort and be nice to us

So youve made another lot of friends said Mother first the railway
and then the canal

Oh yes said Bobbie I think everyone in the world is friends if you
can only get them to see you dont want to be UNfriends

Perhaps youre right said Mother and she sighed Come Chicks Its
bedtime

Yes said Phyllis Oh dearand we went up there to talk about what
wed do for Perkss birthday And we havent talked a single thing about
it

No more we have said Bobbie but Peters saved Reginald Horaces
life I think thats about good enough for one evening

Bobbie would have saved him if I hadnt knocked her down twice I did
said Peter loyally

So would I said Phyllis if Id known what to do

Yes said Mother youve saved a little childs life I do think
thats enough for one evening Oh my darlings thank God YOURE all
safe



Chapter IX The pride of Perks


It was breakfasttime Mothers face was very bright as she poured the
milk and ladled out the porridge

Ive sold another story Chickies she said the one about the King
of the Mussels so therell be buns for tea You can go and get them as
soon as theyre baked About eleven isnt it

Peter Phyllis and Bobbie exchanged glances with each other six
glances in all Then Bobbie said

Mother would you mind if we didnt have the buns for tea tonight but
on the fifteenth Thats next Thursday

_I_ dont mind when you have them dear said Mother but why

Because its Perkss birthday said Bobbie hes thirtytwo and
he says he doesnt keep his birthday any more because hes got other
things to keepnot rabbits or secretsbut the kids and the missus

You mean his wife and children said Mother

Yes said Phyllis its the same thing isnt it

And we thought wed make a nice birthday for him Hes been so awfully
jolly decent to us you know Mother said Peter and we agreed that
next bunday wed ask you if we could

But suppose there hadnt been a bunday before the fifteenth said
Mother

Oh then we meant to ask you to let us antiantipate it and go
without when the bunday came

Anticipate said Mother I see Certainly It would be nice to put
his name on the buns with pink sugar wouldnt it

Perks said Peter its not a pretty name

His other names Albert said Phyllis I asked him once

We might put A P said Mother Ill show you how when the day
comes

This was all very well as far as it went But even fourteen halfpenny
buns with A P on them in pink sugar do not of themselves make a very
grand celebration

There are always flowers of course said Bobbie later when a really
earnest council was being held on the subject in the hayloft where
the broken chaffcutting machine was and the row of holes to drop hay
through into the hayracks over the mangers of the stables below

Hes got lots of flowers of his own said Peter

But its always nice to have them given you said Bobbie however
many youve got of your own We can use flowers for trimmings to the
birthday But there must be something to trim besides buns

Lets all be quiet and think said Phyllis no ones to speak until
its thought of something

So they were all quiet and so very still that a brown rat thought that
there was no one in the loft and came out very boldly When Bobbie
sneezed the rat was quite shocked and hurried away for he saw that a
hayloft where such things could happen was no place for a respectable
middleaged rat that liked a quiet life

Hooray cried Peter suddenly Ive got it He jumped up and kicked
at the loose hay

What said the others eagerly

Why Perks is so nice to everybody There must be lots of people in the
village whod like to help to make him a birthday Lets go round and
ask everybody

Mother said we werent to ask people for things said Bobbie
doubtfully

For ourselves she meant silly not for other people Ill ask the old
gentleman too You see if I dont said Peter

Lets ask Mother first said Bobbie

Oh whats the use of bothering Mother about every little thing
said Peter especially when shes busy Come on Lets go down to the
village now and begin

So they went The old lady at the Postoffice said she didnt see why
Perks should have a birthday any more than anyone else

No said Bobbie I should like everyone to have one Only we know
when his is

Mines tomorrow said the old lady and much notice anyone will take
of it Go along with you

So they went

And some people were kind and some were crusty And some would give and
some would not It is rather difficult work asking for things even for
other people as you have no doubt found if you have ever tried it

When the children got home and counted up what had been given and what
had been promised they felt that for the first day it was not so bad
Peter wrote down the lists of the things in the little pocketbook where
he kept the numbers of his engines These were the lists

 GIVEN
 A tobacco pipe from the sweet shop
 Half a pound of tea from the grocers
 A woollen scarf slightly faded from the drapers which was the
 other side of the grocers
 A stuffed squirrel from the Doctor

 PROMISED
 A piece of meat from the butcher
 Six fresh eggs from the woman who lived in the old turnpike cottage
 A piece of honeycomb and six bootlaces from the cobbler and an
 iron shovel from the blacksmiths

Very early next morning Bobbie got up and woke Phyllis This had been
agreed on between them They had not told Peter because they thought he
would think it silly But they told him afterwards when it had turned
out all right

They cut a big bunch of roses and put it in a basket with the
needlebook that Phyllis had made for Bobbie on her birthday and a very
pretty blue necktie of Phylliss Then they wrote on a paper For Mrs
Ransome with our best love because it is her birthday and they put
the paper in the basket and they took it to the Postoffice and went
in and put it on the counter and ran away before the old woman at the
Postoffice had time to get into her shop

When they got home Peter had grown confidential over helping Mother to
get the breakfast and had told her their plans

Theres no harm in it said Mother but it depends HOW you do it I
only hope he wont be offended and think its CHARITY Poor people are
very proud you know

It isnt because hes poor said Phyllis its because were fond of
him

Ill find some things that Phyllis has outgrown said Mother if
youre quite sure you can give them to him without his being offended I
should like to do some little thing for him because hes been so kind to
you I cant do much because were poor ourselves What are you writing
Bobbie

Nothing particular said Bobbie who had suddenly begun to scribble
Im sure hed like the things Mother

The morning of the fifteenth was spent very happily in getting the buns
and watching Mother make A P on them with pink sugar You know how
its done of course You beat up whites of eggs and mix powdered sugar
with them and put in a few drops of cochineal And then you make a cone
of clean white paper with a little hole at the pointed end and put the
pink eggsugar in at the big end It runs slowly out at the pointed end
and you write the letters with it just as though it were a great fat pen
full of pink sugarink

The buns looked beautiful with A P on every one and when they were
put in a cool oven to set the sugar the children went up to the village
to collect the honey and the shovel and the other promised things

The old lady at the Postoffice was standing on her doorstep The
children said Good morning politely as they passed

Here stop a bit she said

So they stopped

Those roses said she

Did you like them said Phyllis they were as fresh as fresh _I_
made the needlebook but it was Bobbies present She skipped joyously
as she spoke

Heres your basket said the Postoffice woman She went in and
brought out the basket It was full of fat red gooseberries

I dare say Perkss children would like them said she

You ARE an old dear said Phyllis throwing her arms around the old
ladys fat waist Perks WILL be pleased

He wont be half so pleased as I was with your needlebook and the tie
and the pretty flowers and all said the old lady patting Phylliss
shoulder Youre good little souls that you are Look here Ive got a
pram round the back in the woodlodge It was got for my Emmies first
that didnt live but six months and she never had but that one Id
like Mrs Perks to have it It ud be a help to her with that great boy
of hers Will you take it along

OH said all the children together

When Mrs Ransome had got out the perambulator and taken off the careful
papers that covered it and dusted it all over she said

Well there it is I dont know but what Id have given it to her
before if Id thought of it Only I didnt quite know if shed accept of
it from me You tell her it was my Emmies little ones pram

Oh ISNT it nice to think there is going to be a real live baby in it
again

Yes said Mrs Ransome sighing and then laughing here Ill give
you some peppermint cushions for the little ones and then you run along
before I give you the roof off my head and the clothes off my back

All the things that had been collected for Perks were packed into
the perambulator and at halfpast three Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis
wheeled it down to the little yellow house where Perks lived

The house was very tidy On the window ledge was a jug of wildflowers
big daisies and red sorrel and feathery flowery grasses

There was a sound of splashing from the washhouse and a partly washed
boy put his head round the door

Mothers achanging of herself he said

Down in a minute a voice sounded down the narrow freshly scrubbed
stairs

The children waited Next moment the stairs creaked and Mrs Perks came
down buttoning her bodice Her hair was brushed very smooth and tight
and her face shone with soap and water

Im a bit late changing Miss she said to Bobbie owing to me having
had a extry cleanup today along o Perks happening to name its being
his birthday I dont know what put it into his head to think of such
a thing We keeps the childrens birthdays of course but him and
mewere too old for such like as a general rule

We knew it was his birthday said Peter and weve got some presents
for him outside in the perambulator

As the presents were being unpacked Mrs Perks gasped When they
were all unpacked she surprised and horrified the children by sitting
suddenly down on a wooden chair and bursting into tears

Oh dont said everybody oh please dont And Peter added
perhaps a little impatiently What on earth is the matter You dont
mean to say you dont like it

Mrs Perks only sobbed The Perks children now as shinyfaced as anyone
could wish stood at the washhouse door and scowled at the intruders
There was a silence an awkward silence

DONT you like it said Peter again while his sisters patted Mrs
Perks on the back

She stopped crying as suddenly as she had begun

There there dont you mind me IM all right she said Like it
Why its a birthday such as Perks never ad not even when e was a boy
and stayed with his uncle who was a corn chandler in his own account
He failed afterwards Like it Oh and then she went on and said all
sorts of things that I wont write down because I am sure that Peter
and Bobbie and Phyllis would not like me to Their ears got hotter and
hotter and their faces redder and redder at the kind things Mrs Perks
said They felt they had done nothing to deserve all this praise

At last Peter said Look here were glad youre pleased But if you go
on saying things like that we must go home And we did want to stay and
see if Mr Perks is pleased too But we cant stand this

I wont say another single word said Mrs Perks with a beaming face
but that neednt stop me thinking need it For if ever

Can we have a plate for the buns Bobbie asked abruptly And then Mrs
Perks hastily laid the table for tea and the buns and the honey and
the gooseberries were displayed on plates and the roses were put in two
glass jam jars and the teatable looked as Mrs Perks said fit for a
Prince

To think she said me getting the place tidy early and the little
uns getting the wildflowers and allwhen never did I think thered be
anything more for him except the ounce of his pet particular that I
got o Saturday and been saving up for im ever since Bless us e IS
early

Perks had indeed unlatched the latch of the little front gate

Oh whispered Bobbie lets hide in the back kitchen and YOU tell
him about it But give him the tobacco first because you got it for
him And when youve told him well all come in and shout Many happy
returns

It was a very nice plan but it did not quite come off To begin with
there was only just time for Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis to rush into
the washhouse pushing the young and openmouthed Perks children in
front of them There was not time to shut the door so that without at
all meaning it they had to listen to what went on in the kitchen The
washhouse was a tight fit for the Perks children and the Three Chimneys
children as well as all the washhouses proper furniture including
the mangle and the copper

Hullo old woman they heard Mr Perkss voice say heres a pretty
setout

Its your birthday tea Bert said Mrs Perks and heres a ounce of
your extry particular I got it o Saturday along o your happening to
remember it was your birthday today

Good old girl said Mr Perks and there was a sound of a kiss

But whats that pram doing here And whats all these bundles And
where did you get the sweetstuff and

The children did not hear what Mrs Perks replied because just then
Bobbie gave a start put her hand in her pocket and all her body grew
stiff with horror

Oh she whispered to the others whatever shall we do I forgot to
put the labels on any of the things He wont know whats from who
Hell think its all US and that were trying to be grand or charitable
or something horrid

Hush said Peter

And then they heard the voice of Mr Perks loud and rather angry

I dont care he said I wont stand it and so I tell you straight

But said Mrs Perks its them children you make such a fuss
aboutthe children from the Three Chimneys

I dont care said Perks firmly not if it was a angel from Heaven
Weve got on all right all these years and no favours asked Im not
going to begin these sort of charity goingson at my time of life so
dont you think it Nell

Oh hush said poor Mrs Perks Bert shut your silly tongue for
goodness sake The all three of ems in the washhouse alistening to
every word you speaks

Then Ill give them something to listen to said the angry Perks
Ive spoke my mind to them afore now and Ill do it again he added
and he took two strides to the washhouse door and flung it wide
openas wide that is as it would go with the tightly packed children
behind it

Come out said Perks come out and tell me what you mean by it Ave
I ever complained to you of being short as you comes this charity lay
over me

OH said Phyllis I thought youd be so pleased Ill never try to be
kind to anyone else as long as I live No I wont not never

She burst into tears

We didnt mean any harm said Peter

It aint what you means so much as what you does said Perks

Oh DONT cried Bobbie trying hard to be braver than Phyllis and to
find more words than Peter had done for explaining in We thought youd
love it We always have things on our birthdays

Oh yes said Perks your own relations thats different

Oh no Bobbie answered NOT our own relations All the servants
always gave us things at home and us to them when it was their
birthdays And when it was mine and Mother gave me the brooch like a
buttercup Mrs Viney gave me two lovely glass pots and nobody thought
she was coming the charity lay over us

If it had been glass pots here said Perks I wouldnt ha said so
much Its there being all this heaps and heaps of things I cant stand
Nonor wont neither

But theyre not all from us said Peter only we forgot to put the
labels on Theyre from all sorts of people in the village

Who put em up to it Id like to know asked Perks

Why we did sniffed Phyllis

Perks sat down heavily in the elbowchair and looked at them with what
Bobbie afterwards described as withering glances of gloomy despair

So youve been round telling the neighbours we cant make both
ends meet Well now youve disgraced us as deep as you can in the
neighbourhood you can just take the whole bag of tricks back were it
come from Very much obliged Im sure I dont doubt but what you meant
it kind but Id rather not be acquainted with you any longer if its
all the same to you He deliberately turned the chair round so that
his back was turned to the children The legs of the chair grated on the
brick floor and that was the only sound that broke the silence

Then suddenly Bobbie spoke

Look here she said this is most awful

Thats what I says said Perks not turning round

Look here said Bobbie desperately well go if you likeand you
neednt be friends with us any more if you dont want but

WE shall always be friends with YOU however nasty you are to us
sniffed Phyllis wildly

Be quiet said Peter in a fierce aside

But before we go Bobbie went on desperately do let us show you the
labels we wrote to put on the things

I dont want to see no labels said Perks except proper luggage ones
in my own walk of life Do you think Ive kept respectable and outer
debt on what I gets and her having to take in washing to be give away
for a laughingstock to all the neighbours

Laughing said Peter you dont know

Youre a very hasty gentleman whined Phyllis you know you were
wrong once before about us not telling you the secret about the
Russian Do let Bobbie tell you about the labels

Well Go ahead said Perks grudgingly

Well then said Bobbie fumbling miserably yet not without hope in
her tightly stuffed pocket we wrote down all the things everybody said
when they gave us the things with the peoples names because Mother
said we ought to be carefulbecausebut I wrote down what she
saidand youll see

But Bobbie could not read the labels just at once She had to swallow
once or twice before she could begin

Mrs Perks had been crying steadily ever since her husband had opened
the washhouse door Now she caught her breath choked and said

Dont you upset yourself Missy _I_ know you meant it kind if he
doesnt

May I read the labels said Bobbie crying on to the slips as she
tried to sort them Mothers first It says

Little Clothes for Mrs Perkss children Mother said Ill find
some of Phylliss things that shes grown out of if youre quite sure
Mr Perks wouldnt be offended and think its meant for charity Id
like to do some little thing for him because hes so kind to you I
cant do much because were poor ourselves

Bobbie paused

Thats all right said Perks your Mas a born lady Well keep the
little frocks and what not Nell

Then theres the perambulator and the gooseberries and the sweets
said Bobbie theyre from Mrs Ransome She said I dare say Mr
Perkss children would like the sweets And the perambulator was got for
my Emmies firstit didnt live but six months and shes never had but
that one Id like Mrs Perks to have it It would be a help with her
fine boy Id have given it before if Id been sure shed accept of
it from me She told me to tell you Bobbie added that it was her
Emmies little ones pram

I cant send that pram back Bert said Mrs Perks firmly and I
wont So dont you ask me

Im not aasking anything said Perks gruffly

Then the shovel said Bobbie Mr James made it for you himself And
he saidwhere is it Oh yes here He said You tell Mr Perks its a
pleasure to make a little trifle for a man as is so much respected and
then he said he wished he could shoe your children and his own children
like they do the horses because well he knew what shoe leather was

James is a good enough chap said Perks

Then the honey said Bobbie in haste and the bootlaces HE said
he respected a man that paid his wayand the butcher said the same And
the old turnpike woman said many was the time youd lent her a hand
with her garden when you were a ladand things like that came home to
roostI dont know what she meant And everybody who gave anything said
they liked you and it was a very good idea of ours and nobody said
anything about charity or anything horrid like that And the old
gentleman gave Peter a gold pound for you and said you were a man who
knew your work And I thought youd LOVE to know how fond people are
of you and I never was so unhappy in my life Goodbye I hope youll
forgive us some day

She could say no more and she turned to go

Stop said Perks still with his back to them I take back every word
Ive said contrary to what youd wish Nell set on the kettle

Well take the things away if youre unhappy about them said Peter
but I think everybodyll be most awfully disappointed as well as us

Im not unhappy about them said Perks I dont know he added
suddenly wheeling the chair round and showing a very oddlooking
screwedup face I dont know as ever I was better pleased Not so much
with the presentsthough theyre an A1 collectionbut the kind respect
of our neighbours Thats worth having eh Nell

I think its all worth having said Mrs Perks and youve made a
most ridiculous fuss about nothing Bert if you ask me

No I aint said Perks firmly if a man didnt respect hisself no
one wouldnt do it for him

But everyone respects you said Bobbie they all said so

I knew youd like it when you really understood said Phyllis
brightly

Humph Youll stay to tea said Mr Perks

Later on Peter proposed Mr Perkss health And Mr Perks proposed a
toast also honoured in tea and the toast was May the garland of
friendship be ever green which was much more poetical than anyone had
expected from him

      

Jolly good little kids those said Mr Perks to his wife as they went
to bed

Oh theyre all right bless their hearts said his wife its you
thats the aggravatingest old thing that ever was I was ashamed of
youI tell you

You didnt need to be old gal I climbed down handsome soon as I
understood it wasnt charity But charitys what I never did abide and
wont neither

      

All sorts of people were made happy by that birthday party Mr Perks
and Mrs Perks and the little Perkses by all the nice things and by the
kind thoughts of their neighbours the Three Chimneys children by the
success undoubted though unexpectedly delayed of their plan and Mrs
Ransome every time she saw the fat Perks baby in the perambulator
Mrs Perks made quite a round of visits to thank people for their kind
birthday presents and after each visit felt that she had a better
friend than she had thought

Yes said Perks reflectively its not so much what you does as what
you means thats what I say Now if it had been charity

Oh drat charity said Mrs Perks nobody wont offer you
charity Bert however much you was to want it I lay That was just
friendliness that was

When the clergyman called on Mrs Perks she told him all about it It
WAS friendliness wasnt it Sir said she

I think said the clergyman it was what is sometimes called
lovingkindness

So you see it was all right in the end But if one does that sort of
thing one has to be careful to do it in the right way For as Mr
Perks said when he had time to think it over its not so much what you
do as what you mean



Chapter X The terrible secret


When they first went to live at Three Chimneys the children had talked
a great deal about their Father and had asked a great many questions
about him and what he was doing and where he was and when he would come
home Mother always answered their questions as well as she could But
as the time went on they grew to speak less of him Bobbie had felt
almost from the first that for some strange miserable reason these
questions hurt Mother and made her sad And little by little the others
came to have this feeling too though they could not have put it into
words

One day when Mother was working so hard that she could not leave off
even for ten minutes Bobbie carried up her tea to the big bare room
that they called Mothers workshop It had hardly any furniture Just
a table and a chair and a rug But always big pots of flowers on the
windowsills and on the mantelpiece The children saw to that And from
the three long uncurtained windows the beautiful stretch of meadow and
moorland the far violet of the hills and the unchanging changefulness
of cloud and sky

Heres your tea Motherlove said Bobbie do drink it while its
hot

Mother laid down her pen among the pages that were scattered all over
the table pages covered with her writing which was almost as plain
as print and much prettier She ran her hands into her hair as if she
were going to pull it out by handfuls

Poor dear head said Bobbie does it ache

Noyesnot much said Mother Bobbie do you think Peter and Phil
are FORGETTING Father

NO said Bobbie indignantly Why

You none of you ever speak of him now

Bobbie stood first on one leg and then on the other

We often talk about him when were by ourselves she said

But not to me said Mother Why

Bobbie did not find it easy to say why

Iyou she said and stopped She went over to the window and looked
out

Bobbie come here said her Mother and Bobbie came

Now said Mother putting her arm round Bobbie and laying her ruffled
head against Bobbies shoulder try to tell me dear

Bobbie fidgeted

Tell Mother

Well then said Bobbie I thought you were so unhappy about Daddy
not being here it made you worse when I talked about him So I stopped
doing it

And the others

I dont know about the others said Bobbie I never said anything
about THAT to them But I expect they felt the same about it as me

Bobbie dear said Mother still leaning her head against her Ill
tell you Besides parting from Father he and I have had a great
sorrowoh terribleworse than anything you can think of and at first
it did hurt to hear you all talking of him as if everything were just
the same But it would be much more terrible if you were to forget him
That would be worse than anything

The trouble said Bobbie in a very little voiceI promised I
would never ask you any questions and I never have have I Butthe
troubleit wont last always

No said Mother the worst will be over when Father comes home to
us

I wish I could comfort you said Bobbie

Oh my dear do you suppose you dont Do you think I havent noticed
how good youve all been not quarrelling nearly as much as you used
toand all the little kind things you do for methe flowers and
cleaning my shoes and tearing up to make my bed before I get time to do
it myself

Bobbie HAD sometimes wondered whether Mother noticed these things

Thats nothing she said to what

I MUST get on with my work said Mother giving Bobbie one last
squeeze Dont say anything to the others

That evening in the hour before bedtime instead of reading to the
children Mother told them stories of the games she and Father used
to have when they were children and lived near each other in the
countrytales of the adventures of Father with Mothers brothers when
they were all boys together Very funny stories they were and the
children laughed as they listened

Uncle Edward died before he was grown up didnt he said Phyllis as
Mother lighted the bedroom candles

Yes dear said Mother you would have loved him He was such a
brave boy and so adventurous Always in mischief and yet friends with
everybody in spite of it And your Uncle Reggies in Ceylonyes and
Fathers away too But I think theyd all like to think wed enjoyed
talking about the things they used to do Dont you think so

Not Uncle Edward said Phyllis in a shocked tone hes in Heaven

You dont suppose hes forgotten us and all the old times because God
has taken him any more than I forget him Oh no he remembers Hes
only away for a little time We shall see him some day

And Uncle Reggieand Father too said Peter

Yes said Mother Uncle Reggie and Father too Good night my
darlings

Good night said everyone Bobbie hugged her mother more closely even
than usual and whispered in her ear Oh I do love you so MummyI
doI do

When Bobbie came to think it all over she tried not to wonder what
the great trouble was But she could not always help it Father was not
deadlike poor Uncle EdwardMother had said so And he was not ill or
Mother would have been with him Being poor wasnt the trouble Bobbie
knew it was something nearer the heart than money could be

I mustnt try to think what it is she told herself no I mustnt I
AM glad Mother noticed about us not quarrelling so much Well keep that
up

And alas that very afternoon she and Peter had what Peter called a
firstclass shindy

They had not been a week at Three Chimneys before they had asked Mother
to let them have a piece of garden each for their very own and she had
agreed and the south border under the peach trees had been divided into
three pieces and they were allowed to plant whatever they liked there

Phyllis had planted mignonette and nasturtium and Virginia Stock in
hers The seeds came up and though they looked just like weeds Phyllis
believed that they would bear flowers some day The Virginia Stock
justified her faith quite soon and her garden was gay with a band of
bright little flowers pink and white and red and mauve

I cant weed for fear I pull up the wrong things she used to say
comfortably it saves such a lot of work

Peter sowed vegetable seeds in hiscarrots and onions and turnips
The seed was given to him by the farmer who lived in the nice
blackandwhite woodandplaster house just beyond the bridge He
kept turkeys and guinea fowls and was a most amiable man But Peters
vegetables never had much of a chance because he liked to use the earth
of his garden for digging canals and making forts and earthworks for
his toy soldiers And the seeds of vegetables rarely come to much in
a soil that is constantly disturbed for the purposes of war and
irrigation

Bobbie planted rosebushes in her garden but all the little new leaves
of the rosebushes shrivelled and withered perhaps because she moved
them from the other part of the garden in May which is not at all the
right time of year for moving roses But she would not own that they
were dead and hoped on against hope until the day when Perks came up
to see the garden and told her quite plainly that all her roses were as
dead as doornails

Only good for bonfires Miss he said You just dig em up and burn
em and Ill give you some nice fresh roots outer my garden pansies
and stocks and sweet willies and forgetmenots Ill bring em along
tomorrow if you get the ground ready

So next day she set to work and that happened to be the day when Mother
had praised her and the others about not quarrelling She moved the
rosebushes and carried them to the other end of the garden where the
rubbish heap was that they meant to make a bonfire of when Guy Fawkes
Day came

Meanwhile Peter had decided to flatten out all his forts and earthworks
with a view to making a model of the railwaytunnel cutting
embankment canal aqueduct bridges and all

So when Bobbie came back from her last thorny journey with the dead
rosebushes he had got the rake and was using it busily

_I_ was using the rake said Bobbie

Well Im using it now said Peter

But I had it first said Bobbie

Then its my turn now said Peter And that was how the quarrel began

Youre always being disagreeable about nothing said Peter after some
heated argument

I had the rake first said Bobbie flushed and defiant holding on to
its handle

DontI tell you I said this morning I meant to have it Didnt I
Phil

Phyllis said she didnt want to be mixed up in their rows And
instantly of course she was

If you remember you ought to say

Of course she doesnt rememberbut she might say so

I wish Id had a brother instead of two whiny little kiddy sisters
said Peter This was always recognised as indicating the highwater mark
of Peters rage

Bobbie made the reply she always made to it

I cant think why little boys were ever invented and just as she said
it she looked up and saw the three long windows of Mothers workshop
flashing in the red rays of the sun The sight brought back those words
of praise

You dont quarrel like you used to do

OH cried Bobbie just as if she had been hit or had caught her
finger in a door or had felt the hideous sharp beginnings of toothache

Whats the matter said Phyllis

Bobbie wanted to say Dont lets quarrel Mother hates it so but
though she tried hard she couldnt Peter was looking too disagreeable
and insulting

Take the horrid rake then was the best she could manage And she
suddenly let go her hold on the handle Peter had been holding on to
it too firmly and pullingly and now that the pull the other way was
suddenly stopped he staggered and fell over backward the teeth of the
rake between his feet

Serve you right said Bobbie before she could stop herself

Peter lay still for half a momentlong enough to frighten Bobbie a
little Then he frightened her a little more for he sat upscreamed
onceturned rather pale and then lay back and began to shriek faintly
but steadily It sounded exactly like a pig being killed a quarter of a
mile off

Mother put her head out of the window and it wasnt half a minute after
that she was in the garden kneeling by the side of Peter who never for
an instant ceased to squeal

What happened Bobbie Mother asked

It was the rake said Phyllis Peter was pulling at it so was
Bobbie and she let go and he went over

Stop that noise Peter said Mother Come Stop at once

Peter used up what breath he had left in a last squeal and stopped

Now said Mother are you hurt

If he was really hurt he wouldnt make such a fuss said Bobbie
still trembling with fury hes not a coward

I think my foots broken off thats all said Peter huffily and sat
up Then he turned quite white Mother put her arm round him

He IS hurt she said hes fainted Here Bobbie sit down and take
his head on your lap

Then Mother undid Peters boots As she took the right one off
something dripped from his foot on to the ground It was red blood And
when the stocking came off there were three red wounds in Peters foot
and ankle where the teeth of the rake had bitten him and his foot was
covered with red smears

Run for watera basinful said Mother and Phyllis ran She upset
most of the water out of the basin in her haste and had to fetch more
in a jug

Peter did not open his eyes again till Mother had tied her handkerchief
round his foot and she and Bobbie had carried him in and laid him on
the brown wooden settle in the diningroom By this time Phyllis was
halfway to the Doctors

Mother sat by Peter and bathed his foot and talked to him and Bobbie
went out and got tea ready and put on the kettle

Its all I can do she told herself Oh suppose Peter should die or
be a helpless cripple for life or have to walk with crutches or wear a
boot with a sole like a log of wood

She stood by the back door reflecting on these gloomy possibilities her
eyes fixed on the waterbutt

I wish Id never been born she said and she said it out loud

Why lawk a mercy whats that for asked a voice and Perks stood
before her with a wooden trug basket full of greenleaved things and
soft loose earth

Oh its you she said Peters hurt his foot with a rakethree
great gaping wounds like soldiers get And it was partly my fault

That it wasnt Ill go bail said Perks Doctor seen him

Phyllis has gone for the Doctor

Hell be all right you see if he isnt said Perks Why my fathers
second cousin had a hayfork run into him right into his inside and he
was right as ever in a few weeks all except his being a bit weak in
the head afterwards and they did say that it was along of his getting
a touch of the sun in the hayfield and not the fork at all I remember
him well A kindearted chap but soft as you might say

Bobbie tried to let herself be cheered by this heartening reminiscence

Well said Perks you wont want to be bothered with gardening just
this minute I dare say You show me where your garden is and Ill
pop the bits of stuff in for you And Ill hang about if I may make so
free to see the Doctor as he comes out and hear what he says You cheer
up Missie I lay a pound he aint hurt not to speak of

But he was The Doctor came and looked at the foot and bandaged it
beautifully and said that Peter must not put it to the ground for at
least a week

He wont be lame or have to wear crutches or a lump on his foot will
he whispered Bobbie breathlessly at the door

My aunt No said Dr Forrest hell be as nimble as ever on his pins
in a fortnight Dont you worry little Mother Goose

It was when Mother had gone to the gate with the Doctor to take his last
instructions and Phyllis was filling the kettle for tea that Peter and
Bobbie found themselves alone

He says you wont be lame or anything said Bobbie

Oh course I shant silly said Peter very much relieved all the
same

Oh Peter I AM so sorry said Bobbie after a pause

Thats all right said Peter gruffly

It was ALL my fault said Bobbie

Rot said Peter

If we hadnt quarrelled it wouldnt have happened I knew it was wrong
to quarrel I wanted to say so but somehow I couldnt

Dont drivel said Peter I shouldnt have stopped if you HAD said
it Not likely And besides us rowing hadnt anything to do with it
I might have caught my foot in the hoe or taken off my fingers in the
chaffcutting machine or blown my nose off with fireworks It would have
been hurt just the same whether wed been rowing or not

But I knew it was wrong to quarrel said Bobbie in tears and now
youre hurt and

Now look here said Peter firmly you just dry up If youre not
careful youll turn into a beastly little Sundayschool prig so I tell
you

I dont mean to be a prig But its so hard not to be when youre
really trying to be good

The Gentle Reader may perhaps have suffered from this difficulty

Not it said Peter its a jolly good thing it wasnt you was hurt
Im glad it was ME There If it had been you youd have been lying
on the sofa looking like a suffering angel and being the light of the
anxious household and all that And I couldnt have stood it

No I shouldnt said Bobbie

Yes you would said Peter

I tell you I shouldnt

I tell you you would

Oh children said Mothers voice at the door Quarrelling again
Already

We arent quarrellingnot really said Peter I wish you wouldnt
think its rows every time we dont agree When Mother had gone out
again Bobbie broke out

Peter I AM sorry youre hurt But you ARE a beast to say Im a prig

Well said Peter unexpectedly perhaps I am You did say I wasnt a
coward even when you were in such a wax The only thing isdont
you be a prig thats all You keep your eyes open and if you feel
priggishness coming on just stop in time See

Yes said Bobbie I see

Then lets call it Pax said Peter magnanimously bury the hatchet
in the fathoms of the past Shake hands on it I say Bobbie old chap
I am tired

He was tired for many days after that and the settle seemed hard and
uncomfortable in spite of all the pillows and bolsters and soft folded
rugs It was terrible not to be able to go out They moved the settle
to the window and from there Peter could see the smoke of the trains
winding along the valley But he could not see the trains

At first Bobbie found it quite hard to be as nice to him as she wanted
to be for fear he should think her priggish But that soon wore off
and both she and Phyllis were as he observed jolly good sorts Mother
sat with him when his sisters were out And the words hes not a
coward made Peter determined not to make any fuss about the pain in
his foot though it was rather bad especially at night

Praise helps people very much sometimes

There were visitors too Mrs Perks came up to ask how he was and so
did the Station Master and several of the village people But the time
went slowly slowly

I do wish there was something to read said Peter Ive read all our
books fifty times over

Ill go to the Doctors said Phyllis hes sure to have some

Only about how to be ill and about peoples nasty insides I expect
said Peter

Perks has a whole heap of Magazines that came out of trains when people
are tired of them said Bobbie Ill run down and ask him

So the girls went their two ways

Bobbie found Perks busy cleaning lamps

And hows the young gent said he

Better thanks said Bobbie but hes most frightfully bored I came
to ask if youd got any Magazines you could lend him

There now said Perks regretfully rubbing his ear with a black
and oily lump of cotton waste why didnt I think of that now I was
trying to think of something as ud amuse him only this morning and I
couldnt think of anything better than a guineapig And a young chap I
knows going to fetch that over for him this teatime

How lovely A real live guinea He will be pleased But hed like the
Magazines as well

Thats just it said Perks Ive just sent the pick of em to
Snigsons boyhim whats just getting over the pewmonia But Ive lots
of illustrated papers left

He turned to the pile of papers in the corner and took up a heap six
inches thick

There he said Ill just slip a bit of string and a bit of paper
round em

He pulled an old newspaper from the pile and spread it on the table and
made a neat parcel of it

There said he theres lots of pictures and if he likes to mess em
about with his paintbox or coloured chalks or what not why let him
_I_ dont want em

Youre a dear said Bobbie took the parcel and started The papers
were heavy and when she had to wait at the levelcrossing while a train
went by she rested the parcel on the top of the gate And idly she
looked at the printing on the paper that the parcel was wrapped in

Suddenly she clutched the parcel tighter and bent her head over it It
seemed like some horrible dream She read onthe bottom of the column
was torn offshe could read no farther

She never remembered how she got home But she went on tiptoe to her
room and locked the door Then she undid the parcel and read that
printed column again sitting on the edge of her bed her hands and feet
icy cold and her face burning When she had read all there was she drew
a long uneven breath

So now I know she said

What she had read was headed End of the Trial Verdict Sentence

The name of the man who had been tried was the name of her Father
The verdict was Guilty And the sentence was Five years Penal
Servitude

Oh Daddy she whispered crushing the paper hard its not trueI
dont believe it You never did it Never never never

There was a hammering on the door

What is it said Bobbie

Its me said the voice of Phyllis teas ready and a boys brought
Peter a guineapig Come along down

And Bobbie had to



Chapter XI The hound in the red jersey


Bobbie knew the secret now A sheet of old newspaper wrapped round a
parceljust a little chance like thathad given the secret to her And
she had to go down to tea and pretend that there was nothing the matter
The pretence was bravely made but it wasnt very successful

For when she came in everyone looked up from tea and saw her
pinklidded eyes and her pale face with red tearblotches on it

My darling cried Mother jumping up from the teatray whatever IS
the matter

My head aches rather said Bobbie And indeed it did

Has anything gone wrong Mother asked

Im all right really said Bobbie and she telegraphed to her Mother
from her swollen eyes this brief imploring messageNOT before the
others

Tea was not a cheerful meal Peter was so distressed by the obvious fact
that something horrid had happened to Bobbie that he limited his speech
to repeating More bread and butter please at startlingly short
intervals Phyllis stroked her sisters hand under the table to express
sympathy and knocked her cup over as she did it Fetching a cloth and
wiping up the spilt milk helped Bobbie a little But she thought that
tea would never end Yet at last it did end as all things do at last
and when Mother took out the tray Bobbie followed her

Shes gone to own up said Phyllis to Peter I wonder what shes
done

Broken something I suppose said Peter but she neednt be so silly
over it Mother never rows for accidents Listen Yes theyre going
upstairs Shes taking Mother up to show herthe waterjug with storks
on it I expect it is

Bobbie in the kitchen had caught hold of Mothers hand as she set down
the teathings

What is it Mother asked

But Bobbie only said Come upstairs come up where nobody can hear us

When she had got Mother alone in her room she locked the door and then
stood quite still and quite without words

All through tea she had been thinking of what to say she had decided
that I know all or All is known to me or The terrible secret is
a secret no longer would be the proper thing But now that she and
her Mother and that awful sheet of newspaper were alone in the room
together she found that she could say nothing

Suddenly she went to Mother and put her arms round her and began to cry
again And still she could find no words only Oh Mammy oh Mammy
oh Mammy over and over again

Mother held her very close and waited

Suddenly Bobbie broke away from her and went to her bed From under her
mattress she pulled out the paper she had hidden there and held it out
pointing to her Fathers name with a finger that shook

Oh Bobbie Mother cried when one little quick look had shown her
what it was you dont BELIEVE it You dont believe Daddy did it

NO Bobbie almost shouted She had stopped crying

Thats all right said Mother Its not true And theyve shut him
up in prison but hes done nothing wrong Hes good and noble and
honourable and he belongs to us We have to think of that and be proud
of him and wait

Again Bobbie clung to her Mother and again only one word came to her
but now that word was Daddy and Oh Daddy oh Daddy oh Daddy
again and again

Why didnt you tell me Mammy she asked presently

Are you going to tell the others Mother asked

No

Why

Because

Exactly said Mother so you understand why I didnt tell you We two
must help each other to be brave

Yes said Bobbie Mother will it make you more unhappy if you tell
me all about it I want to understand

So then sitting cuddled up close to her Mother Bobbie heard all
about it She heard how those men who had asked to see Father on that
remembered last night when the Engine was being mended had come
to arrest him charging him with selling State secrets to the
Russianswith being in fact a spy and a traitor She heard about the
trial and about the evidenceletters found in Fathers desk at the
office letters that convinced the jury that Father was guilty

Oh how could they look at him and believe it cried Bobbie and how
could ANY one do such a thing

SOMEONE did it said Mother and all the evidence was against Father
Those letters

Yes How did the letters get into his desk

Someone put them there And the person who put them there was the
person who was really guilty

HE must be feeling pretty awful all this time said Bobbie
thoughtfully

I dont believe he had any feelings Mother said hotly he couldnt
have done a thing like that if he had

Perhaps he just shoved the letters into the desk to hide them when he
thought he was going to be found out Why dont you tell the lawyers
or someone that it must have been that person There wasnt anyone that
would have hurt Father on purpose was there

I dont knowI dont know The man under him who got Daddys place
when hewhen the awful thing happenedhe was always jealous of your
Father because Daddy was so clever and everyone thought such a lot of
him And Daddy never quite trusted that man

Couldnt we explain all that to someone

Nobody will listen said Mother very bitterly nobody at all Do you
suppose Ive not tried everything No my dearest theres nothing to be
done All we can do you and I and Daddy is to be brave and patient
and she spoke very softlyto pray Bobbie dear

Mother youve got very thin said Bobbie abruptly

A little perhaps

And oh said Bobbie I do think youre the bravest person in the
world as well as the nicest

We wont talk of all this any more will we dear said Mother we
must bear it and be brave And darling try not to think of it Try to
be cheerful and to amuse yourself and the others Its much easier for
me if you can be a little bit happy and enjoy things Wash your poor
little round face and lets go out into the garden for a bit

The other two were very gentle and kind to Bobbie And they did not
ask her what was the matter This was Peters idea and he had drilled
Phyllis who would have asked a hundred questions if she had been left
to herself

A week later Bobbie managed to get away alone And once more she wrote a
letter And once more it was to the old gentleman

My dear Friend she said you see what is in this paper It is
not true Father never did it Mother says someone put the papers in
Fathers desk and she says the man under him that got Fathers place
afterwards was jealous of Father and Father suspected him a long time
But nobody listens to a word she says but you are so good and clever
and you found out about the Russian gentlemans wife directly Cant you
find out who did the treason because he wasnt Father upon my honour
he is an Englishman and uncapable to do such things and then they would
let Father out of prison It is dreadful and Mother is getting so thin
She told us once to pray for all prisoners and captives I see now
Oh do help methere is only just Mother and me know and we cant do
anything Peter and Phil dont know Ill pray for you twice every day
as long as I live if youll only tryjust try to find out Think if it
was YOUR Daddy what you would feel Oh do do DO help me With love

I remain Your affectionately little friend

Roberta

PS Mother would send her kind regards if she knew I am writingbut
it is no use telling her I am in case you cant do anything But I know
you will Bobbie with best love

She cut the account of her Fathers trial out of the newspaper with
Mothers big cuttingout scissors and put it in the envelope with her
letter

Then she took it down to the station going out the back way and round
by the road so that the others should not see her and offer to come
with her and she gave the letter to the Station Master to give to the
old gentleman next morning

Where HAVE you been shouted Peter from the top of the yard wall
where he and Phyllis were

To the station of course said Bobbie give us a hand Pete

She set her foot on the lock of the yard door Peter reached down a
hand

What on earth she asked as she reached the walltopfor Phyllis and
Peter were very muddy A lump of wet clay lay between them on the wall
they had each a slip of slate in a very dirty hand and behind Peter
out of the reach of accidents were several strange rounded objects
rather like very fat sausages hollow but closed up at one end

Its nests said Peter swallows nests Were going to dry them
in the oven and hang them up with string under the eaves of the
coachhouse

Yes said Phyllis and then were going to save up all the wool and
hair we can get and in the spring well line them and then how pleased
the swallows will be

Ive often thought people dont do nearly enough for dumb animals
said Peter with an air of virtue I do think people might have thought
of making nests for poor little swallows before this

Oh said Bobbie vaguely if everybody thought of everything thered
be nothing left for anybody else to think about

Look at the nestsarent they pretty said Phyllis reaching across
Peter to grasp a nest

Look out Phil you goat said her brother But it was too late her
strong little fingers had crushed the nest

There now said Peter

Never mind said Bobbie

It IS one of my own said Phyllis so you neednt jaw Peter Yes
weve put our initial names on the ones weve done so that the swallows
will know who theyve got to be so grateful to and fond of

Swallows cant read silly said Peter

Silly yourself retorted Phyllis how do you know

Who thought of making the nests anyhow shouted Peter

I did screamed Phyllis

Nya rejoined Peter you only thought of making hay ones and sticking
them in the ivy for the sparrows and theyd have been sopping LONG
before egglaying time It was me said clay and swallows

I dont care what you said

Look said Bobbie Ive made the nest all right again Give me the
bit of stick to mark your initial name on it But how can you Your
letter and Peters are the same P for Peter P for Phyllis

I put F for Phyllis said the child of that name Thats how
it sounds The swallows wouldnt spell Phyllis with a P Im
certainsure

They cant spell at all Peter was still insisting

Then why do you see them always on Christmas cards and valentines
with letters round their necks How would they know where to go if they
couldnt read

Thats only in pictures You never saw one really with letters round
its neck

Well I have a pigeon then at least Daddy told me they did Only it
was under their wings and not round their necks but it comes to the
same thing and

I say interrupted Bobbie theres to be a paperchase tomorrow

Who Peter asked

Grammar School Perks thinks the hare will go along by the line at
first We might go along the cutting You can see a long way from
there

The paperchase was found to be a more amusing subject of conversation
than the reading powers of swallows Bobbie had hoped it might be And
next morning Mother let them take their lunch and go out for the day to
see the paperchase

If we go to the cutting said Peter we shall see the workmen even
if we miss the paperchase

Of course it had taken some time to get the line clear from the rocks
and earth and trees that had fallen on it when the great landslip
happened That was the occasion you will remember when the three
children saved the train from being wrecked by waving six little
redflannelpetticoat flags It is always interesting to watch people
working especially when they work with such interesting things as
spades and picks and shovels and planks and barrows when they have
cindery red fires in iron pots with round holes in them and red lamps
hanging near the works at night Of course the children were never
out at night but once at dusk when Peter had got out of his bedroom
skylight on to the roof he had seen the red lamp shining far away at
the edge of the cutting The children had often been down to watch the
work and this day the interest of picks and spades and barrows being
wheeled along planks completely put the paperchase out of their heads
so that they quite jumped when a voice just behind them panted Let me
pass please It was the harea bigboned looselimbed boy with dark
hair lying flat on a very damp forehead The bag of torn paper under
his arm was fastened across one shoulder by a strap The children stood
back The hare ran along the line and the workmen leaned on their picks
to watch him He ran on steadily and disappeared into the mouth of the
tunnel

Thats against the bylaws said the foreman

Why worry said the oldest workman live and let lives what I always
say Aint you never been young yourself Mr Bates

I ought to report him said the foreman

Why spoil sports what I always say

Passengers are forbidden to cross the line on any pretence murmured
the foreman doubtfully

He aint no passenger said one of the workmen

Nor e aint crossed the line not where we could see im do it said
another

Nor yet e aint made no pretences said a third

And said the oldest workman es outer sight now What the eye
dont see the art neednt take no notice ofs what I always say

And now following the track of the hare by the little white blots of
scattered paper came the hounds There were thirty of them and they
all came down the steep ladderlike steps by ones and twos and threes
and sixes and sevens Bobbie and Phyllis and Peter counted them as they
passed The foremost ones hesitated a moment at the foot of the ladder
then their eyes caught the gleam of scattered whiteness along the line
and they turned towards the tunnel and by ones and twos and threes and
sixes and sevens disappeared in the dark mouth of it The last one in
a red jersey seemed to be extinguished by the darkness like a candle
that is blown out

They dont know what theyre in for said the foreman it isnt so
easy running in the dark The tunnel takes two or three turns

Theyll take a long time to get through you think Peter asked

An hour or more I shouldnt wonder

Then lets cut across the top and see them come out at the other end
said Peter we shall get there long before they do

The counsel seemed good and they went

They climbed the steep steps from which they had picked the wild cherry
blossom for the grave of the little wild rabbit and reaching the top of
the cutting set their faces towards the hill through which the tunnel
was cut It was stiff work

Its like Alps said Bobbie breathlessly

Or Andes said Peter

Its like Himmy whats its names gasped Phyllis Mount Everlasting
Do lets stop

Stick to it panted Peter youll get your second wind in a minute

Phyllis consented to stick to itand on they went running when the
turf was smooth and the slope easy climbing over stones helping
themselves up rocks by the branches of trees creeping through narrow
openings between tree trunks and rocks and so on and on up and up
till at last they stood on the very top of the hill where they had so
often wished to be

Halt cried Peter and threw himself flat on the grass For the very
top of the hill was a smooth turfed tableland dotted with mossy rocks
and little mountainash trees

The girls also threw themselves down flat

Plenty of time Peter panted the rests all down hill

When they were rested enough to sit up and look round them Bobbie
cried

Oh look

What at said Phyllis

The view said Bobbie

I hate views said Phyllis dont you Peter

Lets get on said Peter

But this isnt like a view they take you to in carriages when youre
at the seaside all sea and sand and bare hills Its like the coloured
counties in one of Mothers poetry books

Its not so dusty said Peter look at the Aqueduct straddling slap
across the valley like a giant centipede and then the towns sticking
their church spires up out of the trees like pens out of an inkstand
_I_ think its more like

 There could he see the banners
 Of twelve fair cities shine

I love it said Bobbie its worth the climb

The paperchase is worth the climb said Phyllis if we dont lose it
Lets get on Its all down hill now

_I_ said that ten minutes ago said Peter

Well IVE said it now said Phyllis come on

Loads of time said Peter And there was For when they had got down
to a level with the top of the tunnels mouththey were a couple of
hundred yards out of their reckoning and had to creep along the face of
the hillthere was no sign of the hare or the hounds

Theyve gone long ago of course said Phyllis as they leaned on the
brick parapet above the tunnel

I dont think so said Bobbie but even if they had its ripping
here and we shall see the trains come out of the tunnel like dragons
out of lairs Weve never seen that from the top side before

No more we have said Phyllis partially appeased

It was really a most exciting place to be in The top of the tunnel
seemed ever so much farther from the line than they had expected and
it was like being on a bridge but a bridge overgrown with bushes and
creepers and grass and wildflowers

I KNOW the paperchase has gone long ago said Phyllis every two
minutes and she hardly knew whether she was pleased or disappointed
when Peter leaning over the parapet suddenly cried

Look out Here he comes

They all leaned over the sunwarmed brick wall in time to see the hare
going very slowly come out from the shadow of the tunnel

There now said Peter what did I tell you Now for the hounds

Very soon came the houndsby ones and twos and threes and sixes and
sevensand they also were going slowly and seemed very tired Two or
three who lagged far behind came out long after the others

There said Bobbie thats allnow what shall we do

Go along into the tulgy wood over there and have lunch said Phyllis
we can see them for miles from up here

Not yet said Peter Thats not the last Theres the one in the red
jersey to come yet Lets see the last of them come out

But though they waited and waited and waited the boy in the red jersey
did not appear

Oh lets have lunch said Phyllis Ive got a pain in my front with
being so hungry You must have missed seeing the redjerseyed one when
he came out with the others

But Bobbie and Peter agreed that he had not come out with the others

Lets get down to the tunnel mouth said Peter then perhaps we shall
see him coming along from the inside I expect he felt spunchuck and
rested in one of the manholes You stay up here and watch Bob and when
I signal from below you come down We might miss seeing him on the way
down with all these trees

So the others climbed down and Bobbie waited till they signalled to her
from the line below And then she too scrambled down the roundabout
slippery path among roots and moss till she stepped out between two
dogwood trees and joined the others on the line And still there was no
sign of the hound with the red jersey

Oh do DO lets have something to eat wailed Phyllis I shall die
if you dont and then youll be sorry

Give her the sandwiches for goodness sake and stop her silly mouth
said Peter not quite unkindly Look here he added turning to
Bobbie perhaps wed better have one each too We may need all our
strength Not more than one though Theres no time

What asked Bobbie her mouth already full for she was just as hungry
as Phyllis

Dont you see replied Peter impressively that redjerseyed hound
has had an accidentthats what it is Perhaps even as we speak hes
lying with his head on the metals an unresisting prey to any passing
express

Oh dont try to talk like a book cried Bobbie bolting what was left
of her sandwich come on Phil keep close behind me and if a train
comes stand flat against the tunnel wall and hold your petticoats close
to you

Give me one more sandwich pleaded Phyllis and I will

Im going first said Peter it was my idea and he went

Of course you know what going into a tunnel is like The engine gives
a scream and then suddenly the noise of the running rattling train
changes and grows different and much louder Grownup people pull up the
windows and hold them by the strap The railway carriage suddenly grows
like nightwith lamps of course unless you are in a slow local train
in which case lamps are not always provided Then by and by the darkness
outside the carriage window is touched by puffs of cloudy whiteness
then you see a blue light on the walls of the tunnel then the sound of
the moving train changes once more and you are out in the good open air
again and grownups let the straps go The windows all dim with the
yellow breath of the tunnel rattle down into their places and you see
once more the dip and catch of the telegraph wires beside the line and
the straightcut hawthorn hedges with the tiny baby trees growing up out
of them every thirty yards

All this of course is what a tunnel means when you are in a train But
everything is quite different when you walk into a tunnel on your own
feet and tread on shifting sliding stones and gravel on a path that
curves downwards from the shining metals to the wall Then you see
slimy oozy trickles of water running down the inside of the tunnel
and you notice that the bricks are not red or brown as they are at the
tunnels mouth but dull sticky sickly green Your voice when you
speak is quite changed from what it was out in the sunshine and it is
a long time before the tunnel is quite dark

It was not yet quite dark in the tunnel when Phyllis caught at Bobbies
skirt ripping out half a yard of gathers but no one noticed this at
the time

I want to go back she said I dont like it Itll be pitch dark
in a minute I WONT go on in the dark I dont care what you say I
WONT

Dont be a silly cuckoo said Peter Ive got a candle end and
matches andwhats that

That was a low humming sound on the railway line a trembling of the
wires beside it a buzzing humming sound that grew louder and louder as
they listened

Its a train said Bobbie

Which line

Let me go back cried Phyllis struggling to get away from the hand by
which Bobbie held her

Dont be a coward said Bobbie its quite safe Stand back

Come on shouted Peter who was a few yards ahead Quick Manhole

The roar of the advancing train was now louder than the noise you hear
when your head is under water in the bath and both taps are running and
you are kicking with your heels against the baths tin sides But Peter
had shouted for all he was worth and Bobbie heard him She dragged
Phyllis along to the manhole Phyllis of course stumbled over the
wires and grazed both her legs But they dragged her in and all three
stood in the dark damp arched recess while the train roared louder and
louder It seemed as if it would deafen them And in the distance they
could see its eyes of fire growing bigger and brighter every instant

It IS a dragonI always knew it wasit takes its own shape in here
in the dark shouted Phyllis But nobody heard her You see the train
was shouting too and its voice was bigger than hers

And now with a rush and a roar and a rattle and a long dazzling flash
of lighted carriage windows a smell of smoke and blast of hot air the
train hurtled by clanging and jangling and echoing in the vaulted roof
of the tunnel Phyllis and Bobbie clung to each other Even Peter
caught hold of Bobbies arm in case she should be frightened as he
explained afterwards

And now slowly and gradually the taillights grew smaller and smaller
and so did the noise till with one last WHIZ the train got itself out
of the tunnel and silence settled again on its damp walls and dripping
roof

OH said the children all together in a whisper

Peter was lighting the candle end with a hand that trembled

Come on he said but he had to clear his throat before he could speak
in his natural voice

Oh said Phyllis if the redjerseyed one was in the way of the
train

Weve got to go and see said Peter

Couldnt we go and send someone from the station said Phyllis

Would you rather wait here for us asked Bobbie severely and of
course that settled the question

So the three went on into the deeper darkness of the tunnel Peter led
holding his candle end high to light the way The grease ran down his
fingers and some of it right up his sleeve He found a long streak from
wrist to elbow when he went to bed that night

It was not more than a hundred and fifty yards from the spot where
they had stood while the train went by that Peter stood still shouted
Hullo and then went on much quicker than before When the others
caught him up he stopped And he stopped within a yard of what they had
come into the tunnel to look for Phyllis saw a gleam of red and
shut her eyes tight There by the curved pebbly down line was the
redjerseyed hound His back was against the wall his arms hung limply
by his sides and his eyes were shut

Was the red blood Is he all killed asked Phyllis screwing her
eyelids more tightly together

Killed Nonsense said Peter Theres nothing red about him except
his jersey Hes only fainted What on earth are we to do

Can we move him asked Bobbie

I dont know hes a big chap

Suppose we bathe his forehead with water No I know we havent any
but milks just as wet Theres a whole bottle

Yes said Peter and they rub peoples hands I believe

They burn feathers I know said Phyllis

Whats the good of saying that when we havent any feathers

As it happens said Phyllis in a tone of exasperated triumph Ive
got a shuttlecock in my pocket So there

And now Peter rubbed the hands of the redjerseyed one Bobbie burned
the feathers of the shuttlecock one by one under his nose Phyllis
splashed warmish milk on his forehead and all three kept on saying as
fast and as earnestly as they could

Oh look up speak to me For my sake speak



Chapter XII What Bobbie brought home


Oh look up Speak to me For MY sake speak The children said the
words over and over again to the unconscious hound in a red jersey who
sat with closed eyes and pale face against the side of the tunnel

Wet his ears with milk said Bobbie I know they do it to people that
faintwith eaudeCologne But I expect milks just as good

So they wetted his ears and some of the milk ran down his neck under
the red jersey It was very dark in the tunnel The candle end Peter had
carried and which now burned on a flat stone gave hardly any light at
all

Oh DO look up said Phyllis For MY sake I believe hes dead

For MY sake repeated Bobbie No he isnt

For ANY sake said Peter come out of it And he shook the sufferer
by the arm

And then the boy in the red jersey sighed and opened his eyes and shut
them again and said in a very small voice Chuck it

Oh hes NOT dead said Phyllis I KNEW he wasnt and she began to
cry

Whats up Im all right said the boy

Drink this said Peter firmly thrusting the nose of the milk bottle
into the boys mouth The boy struggled and some of the milk was upset
before he could get his mouth free to say

What is it

Its milk said Peter Fear not you are in the hands of friends
Phil you stop bleating this minute

Do drink it said Bobbie gently itll do you good

So he drank And the three stood by without speaking to him

Let him be a minute Peter whispered hell be all right as soon as
the milk begins to run like fire through his veins

He was

Im better now he announced I remember all about it He tried to
move but the movement ended in a groan Bother I believe Ive broken
my leg he said

Did you tumble down asked Phyllis sniffing

Of course notIm not a kiddie said the boy indignantly it was
one of those beastly wires tripped me up and when I tried to get up
again I couldnt stand so I sat down Gee whillikins it does hurt
though How did YOU get here

We saw you all go into the tunnel and then we went across the hill to
see you all come out And the others didall but you and you didnt
So we are a rescue party said Peter with pride

Youve got some pluck I will say remarked the boy

Oh thats nothing said Peter with modesty Do you think you could
walk if we helped you

I could try said the boy

He did try But he could only stand on one foot the other dragged in a
very nasty way

Here let me sit down I feel like dying said the boy Let go of
melet go quick He lay down and closed his eyes The others looked
at each other by the dim light of the little candle

What on earth said Peter

Look here said Bobbie quickly you must go and get help Go to the
nearest house

Yes thats the only thing said Peter Come on

If you take his feet and Phil and I take his head we could carry him
to the manhole

They did it It was perhaps as well for the sufferer that he had fainted
again

Now said Bobbie Ill stay with him You take the longest bit of
candle and ohbe quick for this bit wont burn long

I dont think Mother would like me leaving you said Peter
doubtfully Let me stay and you and Phil go

No no said Bobbie you and Phil goand lend me your knife Ill
try to get his boot off before he wakes up again

I hope its all right what were doing said Peter

Of course its right said Bobbie impatiently What else WOULD you
do Leave him here all alone because its dark Nonsense Hurry up
thats all

So they hurried up

Bobbie watched their dark figures and the little light of the little
candle with an odd feeling of having come to the end of everything She
knew now she thought what nuns who were bricked up alive in convent
walls felt like Suddenly she gave herself a little shake

Dont be a silly little girl she said She was always very angry when
anyone else called her a little girl even if the adjective that went
first was not silly but nice or good or clever And it was only
when she was very angry with herself that she allowed Roberta to use
that expression to Bobbie

She fixed the little candle end on a broken brick near the redjerseyed
boys feet Then she opened Peters knife It was always hard to
managea halfpenny was generally needed to get it open at all This
time Bobbie somehow got it open with her thumbnail She broke the nail
and it hurt horribly Then she cut the boys bootlace and got the boot
off She tried to pull off his stocking but his leg was dreadfully
swollen and it did not seem to be the proper shape So she cut the
stocking down very slowly and carefully It was a brown knitted
stocking and she wondered who had knitted it and whether it was the
boys mother and whether she was feeling anxious about him and how she
would feel when he was brought home with his leg broken When Bobbie had
got the stocking off and saw the poor leg she felt as though the tunnel
was growing darker and the ground felt unsteady and nothing seemed
quite real

SILLY little girl said Roberta to Bobbie and felt better

The poor leg she told herself it ought to have a cushionah

She remembered the day when she and Phyllis had torn up their red
flannel petticoats to make danger signals to stop the train and prevent
an accident Her flannel petticoat today was white but it would be
quite as soft as a red one She took it off

Oh what useful things flannel petticoats are she said the man who
invented them ought to have a statue directed to him And she said
it aloud because it seemed that any voice even her own would be a
comfort in that darkness

WHAT ought to be directed Who to asked the boy suddenly and very
feebly

Oh said Bobbie now youre better Hold your teeth and dont let it
hurt too much Now

She had folded the petticoat and lifting his leg laid it on the cushion
of folded flannel

Dont faint again PLEASE dont said Bobbie as he groaned She
hastily wetted her handkerchief with milk and spread it over the poor
leg

Oh that hurts cried the boy shrinking Ohno it doesntits
nice really

Whats your name said Bobbie

Jim

Mines Bobbie

But youre a girl arent you

Yes my long names Roberta

I sayBobbie

Yes

Wasnt there some more of you just now

Yes Peter and Philthats my brother and sister Theyve gone to get
someone to carry you out

What rum names All boys

YesI wish I was a boy dont you

I think youre all right as you are

I didnt mean thatI meant dont you wish YOU were a boy but of
course you are without wishing

Youre just as brave as a boy Why didnt you go with the others

Somebody had to stay with you said Bobbie

Tell you what Bobbie said Jim youre a brick Shake He reached
out a redjerseyed arm and Bobbie squeezed his hand

I wont shake it she explained because it would shake YOU and that
would shake your poor leg and that would hurt Have you got a hanky

I dont expect I have He felt in his pocket Yes I have What for

She took it and wetted it with milk and put it on his forehead

Thats jolly he said what is it

Milk said Bobbie We havent any water

Youre a jolly good little nurse said Jim

I do it for Mother sometimes said Bobbienot milk of course
but scent or vinegar and water I say I must put the candle out now
because there maynt be enough of the other one to get you out by

By George said he you think of everything

Bobbie blew Out went the candle You have no idea how blackvelvety the
darkness was

I say Bobbie said a voice through the blackness arent you afraid
of the dark

Notnot very that is

Lets hold hands said the boy and it was really rather good of him
because he was like most boys of his age and hated all material tokens
of affection such as kissing and holding of hands He called all such
things pawings and detested them

The darkness was more bearable to Bobbie now that her hand was held in
the large rough hand of the redjerseyed sufferer and he holding her
little smooth hot paw was surprised to find that he did not mind it so
much as he expected She tried to talk to amuse him and take his mind
off his sufferings but it is very difficult to go on talking in the
dark and presently they found themselves in a silence only broken now
and then by a

You all right Bobbie

or an

Im afraid its hurting you most awfully Jim I AM so sorry

And it was very cold

      

Peter and Phyllis tramped down the long way of the tunnel towards
daylight the candlegrease dripping over Peters fingers There were no
accidents unless you count Phylliss catching her frock on a wire and
tearing a long jagged slit in it and tripping over her bootlace when
it came undone or going down on her hands and knees all four of which
were grazed

Theres no end to this tunnel said Phyllisand indeed it did seem
very very long

Stick to it said Peter everything has an end and you get to it if
you only keep all on

Which is quite true if you come to think of it and a useful thing
to remember in seasons of troublesuch as measles arithmetic
impositions and those times when you are in disgrace and feel as
though no one would ever love you again and you could nevernever
againlove anybody

Hurray said Peter suddenly theres the end of the tunnellooks
just like a pinhole in a bit of black paper doesnt it

The pinhole got largerblue lights lay along the sides of the tunnel
The children could see the gravel way that lay in front of them the air
grew warmer and sweeter Another twenty steps and they were out in the
good glad sunshine with the green trees on both sides

Phyllis drew a long breath

Ill never go into a tunnel again as long as ever I live said she
not if there are twenty hundred thousand millions hounds inside with
red jerseys and their legs broken

Dont be a silly cuckoo said Peter as usual Youd HAVE to

I think it was very brave and good of me said Phyllis

Not it said Peter you didnt go because you were brave but because
Bobbie and I arent skunks Now wheres the nearest house I wonder You
cant see anything here for the trees

Theres a roof over there said Phyllis pointing down the line

Thats the signalbox said Peter and you know youre not allowed to
speak to signalmen on duty Its wrong

Im not near so afraid of doing wrong as I was of going into that
tunnel said Phyllis Come on and she started to run along the line
So Peter ran too

It was very hot in the sunshine and both children were hot and
breathless by the time they stopped and bending their heads back to
look up at the open windows of the signalbox shouted Hi as loud
as their breathless state allowed But no one answered The signalbox
stood quiet as an empty nursery and the handrail of its steps was hot
to the hands of the children as they climbed softly up They peeped
in at the open door The signalman was sitting on a chair tilted back
against the wall His head leaned sideways and his mouth was open He
was fast asleep

My hat cried Peter wake up And he cried it in a terrible voice
for he knew that if a signalman sleeps on duty he risks losing his
situation let alone all the other dreadful risks to trains which expect
him to tell them when it is safe for them to go their ways

The signalman never moved Then Peter sprang to him and shook him And
slowly yawning and stretching the man awoke But the moment he WAS
awake he leapt to his feet put his hands to his head like a mad
maniac as Phyllis said afterwards and shouted

Oh my heavenswhats oclock

Twelve thirteen said Peter and indeed it was by the whitefaced
roundfaced clock on the wall of the signalbox

The man looked at the clock sprang to the levers and wrenched them
this way and that An electric bell tingledthe wires and cranks
creaked and the man threw himself into a chair He was very pale
and the sweat stood on his forehead like large dewdrops on a white
cabbage as Phyllis remarked later He was trembling too the children
could see his big hairy hands shake from side to side with quite
extrasized trembles to use the subsequent words of Peter He drew
long breaths Then suddenly he cried Thank God thank God you come in
when you didoh thank God and his shoulders began to heave and his
face grew red again and he hid it in those large hairy hands of his

Oh dont crydont said Phyllis its all right now and she
patted him on one big broad shoulder while Peter conscientiously
thumped the other

But the signalman seemed quite broken down and the children had to
pat him and thump him for quite a long time before he found his
handkerchiefa red one with mauve and white horseshoes on itand
mopped his face and spoke During this patting and thumping interval a
train thundered by

Im downright shamed that I am were the words of the big signalman
when he had stopped crying snivelling like a kid Then suddenly he
seemed to get cross And what was you doing up here anyway he said
you know it aint allowed

Yes said Phyllis we knew it was wrongbut I wasnt afraid of doing
wrong and so it turned out right You arent sorry we came

Lor love youif you hadnt a come he stopped and then went on
Its a disgrace so it is sleeping on duty If it was to come to be
knowneven as it is when no harms come of it

It wont come to be known said Peter we arent sneaks All the
same you oughtnt to sleep on dutyits dangerous

Tell me something I dont know said the man but I cant help it
I knowd well enough just how it ud be But I couldnt get off They
couldnt get no one to take on my duty I tell you I aint had ten
minutes sleep this last five days My little chaps illpewmonia the
Doctor saysand theres no one but me and is little sister to do for
him Thats where it is The gell must ave her sleep Dangerous Yes I
believe you Now go and split on me if you like

Of course we wont said Peter indignantly but Phyllis ignored the
whole of the signalmans speech except the first six words

You asked us she said to tell you something you dont know Well
I will Theres a boy in the tunnel over there with a red jersey and his
leg broken

What did he want to go into the blooming tunnel for then said the
man

Dont you be so cross said Phyllis kindly WE havent done anything
wrong except coming and waking you up and that was right as it
happens

Then Peter told how the boy came to be in the tunnel

Well said the man I dont see as I can do anything I cant leave
the box

You might tell us where to go after someone who isnt in a box
though said Phyllis

Theres Brigdens farm over yonderwhere you see the smoke acoming
up through the trees said the man more and more grumpy as Phyllis
noticed

Well goodbye then said Peter

But the man said Wait a minute He put his hand in his pocket and
brought out some moneya lot of pennies and one or two shillings and
sixpences and halfacrown He picked out two shillings and held them
out

Here he said Ill give you this to hold your tongues about whats
taken place today

There was a short unpleasant pause Then

You ARE a nasty man though arent you said Phyllis

Peter took a step forward and knocked the mans hand up so that the
shillings leapt out of it and rolled on the floor

If anything COULD make me sneak THAT would he said Come Phil
and marched out of the signalbox with flaming cheeks

Phyllis hesitated Then she took the hand still held out stupidly that
the shillings had been in

I forgive you she said even if Peter doesnt Youre not in your
proper senses or youd never have done that I know want of sleep sends
people mad Mother told me I hope your little boy will soon be better
and

Come on Phil cried Peter eagerly

I give you my sacred honourword well never tell anyone Kiss and be
friends said Phyllis feeling how noble it was of her to try to make
up a quarrel in which she was not to blame

The signalman stooped and kissed her

I do believe Im a bit off my head Sissy he said Now run along
home to Mother I didnt mean to put you aboutthere

So Phil left the hot signalbox and followed Peter across the fields to
the farm

When the farm men led by Peter and Phyllis and carrying a hurdle
covered with horsecloths reached the manhole in the tunnel Bobbie
was fast asleep and so was Jim Worn out with the pain the Doctor said
afterwards

Where does he live the bailiff from the farm asked when Jim had been
lifted on to the hurdle

In Northumberland answered Bobbie

Im at school at Maidbridge said Jim I suppose Ive got to get back
there somehow

Seems to me the Doctor ought to have a look in first said the
bailiff

Oh bring him up to our house said Bobbie Its only a little way by
the road Im sure Mother would say we ought to

Will your Ma like you bringing home strangers with broken legs

She took the poor Russian home herself said Bobbie I know shed say
we ought

All right said the bailiff you ought to know what your Ma ud like
I wouldnt take it upon me to fetch him up to our place without I asked
the Missus first and they call me the Master too

Are you sure your Mother wont mind whispered Jim

Certain said Bobbie

Then were to take him up to Three Chimneys said the bailiff

Of course said Peter

Then my lad shall nip up to Doctors on his bike and tell him to come
down there Now lads lift him quiet and steady One two three

      

Thus it happened that Mother writing away for dear life at a story
about a Duchess a designing villain a secret passage and a missing
will dropped her pen as her workroom door burst open and turned to
see Bobbie hatless and red with running

Oh Mother she cried do come down We found a hound in a red jersey
in the tunnel and hes broken his leg and theyre bringing him home

They ought to take him to the vet said Mother with a worried frown
I really CANT have a lame dog here

Hes not a dog reallyhes a boy said Bobbie between laughing and
choking

Then he ought to be taken home to his mother

His mothers dead said Bobbie and his fathers in Northumberland
Oh Mother you will be nice to him I told him I was sure youd want us
to bring him home You always want to help everybody

Mother smiled but she sighed too It is nice that your children should
believe you willing to open house and heart to any and every one who
needs help But it is rather embarrassing sometimes too when they act
on their belief

Oh well said Mother we must make the best of it

When Jim was carried in dreadfully white and with set lips whose red
had faded to a horrid bluey violet colour Mother said

I am glad you brought him here Now Jim lets get you comfortable in
bed before the Doctor comes

And Jim looking at her kind eyes felt a little warm comforting flush
of new courage

Itll hurt rather wont it he said I dont mean to be a coward
You wont think Im a coward if I faint again will you I really
and truly dont do it on purpose And I do hate to give you all this
trouble

Dont you worry said Mother its you that have the trouble you
poor dearnot us

And she kissed him just as if he had been Peter We love to have you
heredont we Bobbie

Yes said Bobbieand she saw by her Mothers face how right she had
been to bring home the wounded hound in the red jersey



Chapter XIII The hounds grandfather


Mother did not get back to her writing all that day for the
redjerseyed hound whom the children had brought to Three Chimneys had
to be put to bed And then the Doctor came and hurt him most horribly
Mother was with him all through it and that made it a little better
than it would have been but bad was the best as Mrs Viney said

The children sat in the parlour downstairs and heard the sound of the
Doctors boots going backwards and forwards over the bedroom floor And
once or twice there was a groan

Its horrible said Bobbie Oh I wish Dr Forrest would make haste
Oh poor Jim

It IS horrible said Peter but its very exciting I wish Doctors
werent so stuckup about who theyll have in the room when theyre
doing things I should most awfully like to see a leg set I believe the
bones crunch like anything

Dont said the two girls at once

Rubbish said Peter How are you going to be Red Cross Nurses like
you were talking of coming home if you cant even stand hearing me say
about bones crunching Youd have to HEAR them crunch on the field of
battleand be steeped in gore up to the elbows as likely as not and

Stop it cried Bobbie with a white face you dont know how funny
youre making me feel

Me too said Phyllis whose face was pink

Cowards said Peter

Im not said Bobbie I helped Mother with your rakewounded foot
and so did Philyou know we did

Well then said Peter Now look here It would be a jolly good thing
for you if I were to talk to you every day for half an hour about broken
bones and peoples insides so as to get you used to it

A chair was moved above

Listen said Peter thats the bone crunching

I do wish you wouldnt said Phyllis Bobbie doesnt like it

Ill tell you what they do said Peter I cant think what made him so
horrid Perhaps it was because he had been so very nice and kind all the
earlier part of the day and now he had to have a change This is called
reaction One notices it now and then in oneself Sometimes when one has
been extra good for a longer time than usual one is suddenly attacked
by a violent fit of not being good at all Ill tell you what they do
said Peter they strap the broken man down so that he cant resist or
interfere with their doctorish designs and then someone holds his head
and someone holds his legthe broken one and pulls it till the bones
fit inwith a crunch mind you Then they strap it up andlets play
at bonesetting

Oh no said Phyllis

But Bobbie said suddenly All rightLETS Ill be the doctor and
Phil can be the nurse You can be the broken boner we can get at your
legs more easily because you dont wear petticoats

Ill get the splints and bandages said Peter you get the couch of
suffering ready

The ropes that had tied up the boxes that had come from home were all
in a wooden packingcase in the cellar When Peter brought in a trailing
tangle of them and two boards for splints Phyllis was excitedly
giggling

Now then he said and lay down on the settle groaning most
grievously

Not so loud said Bobbie beginning to wind the rope round him and the
settle You pull Phil

Not so tight moaned Peter Youll break my other leg

Bobbie worked on in silence winding more and more rope round him

Thats enough said Peter I cant move at all Oh my poor leg He
groaned again

SURE you cant move asked Bobbie in a rather strange tone

Quite sure replied Peter Shall we play its bleeding freely or
not he asked cheerfully

YOU can play what you like said Bobbie sternly folding her arms and
looking down at him where he lay all wound round and round with cord
Phil and I are going away And we shant untie you till you promise
never never to talk to us about blood and wounds unless we say you may
Come Phil

You beast said Peter writhing Ill never promise never Ill
yell and Mother will come

Do said Bobbie and tell her why we tied you up Come on Phil No
Im not a beast Peter But you wouldnt stop when we asked you and

Yah said Peter it wasnt even your own idea You got it out of
Stalky

Bobbie and Phil retiring in silent dignity were met at the door by the
Doctor He came in rubbing his hands and looking pleased with himself

Well he said THAT jobs done Its a nice clean fracture and itll
go on all right Ive no doubt Plucky young chap toohullo whats
all this

His eye had fallen on Peter who lay mousystill in his bonds on the
settle

Playing at prisoners eh he said but his eyebrows had gone up a
little Somehow he had not thought that Bobbie would be playing while in
the room above someone was having a broken bone set

Oh no said Bobbie not at PRISONERS We were playing at setting
bones Peters the broken boner and I was the doctor

The Doctor frowned

Then I must say he said and he said it rather sternly thats its
a very heartless game Havent you enough imagination even to faintly
picture whats been going on upstairs That poor chap with the drops
of sweat on his forehead and biting his lips so as not to cry out and
every touch on his leg agony and

YOU ought to be tied up said Phyllis youre as bad as

Hush said Bobbie Im sorry but we werent heartless really

I was I suppose said Peter crossly All right Bobbie dont you
go on being noble and screening me because I jolly well wont have it
It was only that I kept on talking about blood and wounds I wanted to
train them for Red Cross Nurses And I wouldnt stop when they asked
me

Well said Dr Forrest sitting down

Wellthen I said Lets play at setting bones It was all rot I
knew Bobbie wouldnt I only said it to tease her And then when she
said yes of course I had to go through with it And they tied me up
They got it out of Stalky And I think its a beastly shame

He managed to writhe over and hide his face against the wooden back of
the settle

I didnt think that anyone would know but us said Bobbie indignantly
answering Peters unspoken reproach I never thought of your coming in
And hearing about blood and wounds does really make me feel most awfully
funny It was only a joke our tying him up Let me untie you Pete

I dont care if you never untie me said Peter and if thats your
idea of a joke

If I were you said the Doctor though really he did not quite know
what to say I should be untied before your Mother comes down You
dont want to worry her just now do you

I dont promise anything about not saying about wounds mind said
Peter in very surly tones as Bobbie and Phyllis began to untie the
knots

Im very sorry Pete Bobbie whispered leaning close to him as she
fumbled with the big knot under the settle but if you only knew how
sick you made me feel

Youve made ME feel pretty sick I can tell you Peter rejoined Then
he shook off the loose cords and stood up

I looked in said Dr Forrest to see if one of you would come along
to the surgery There are some things that your Mother will want at
once and Ive given my man a day off to go and see the circus will you
come Peter

Peter went without a word or a look to his sisters

The two walked in silence up to the gate that led from the Three
Chimneys field to the road Then Peter said

Let me carry your bag I say it is heavywhats in it

Oh knives and lancets and different instruments for hurting people
And the ether bottle I had to give him ether you knowthe agony was
so intense

Peter was silent

Tell me all about how you found that chap said Dr Forrest

Peter told And then Dr Forrest told him stories of brave rescues he
was a most interesting man to talk to as Peter had often remarked

Then in the surgery Peter had a better chance than he had ever had of
examining the Doctors balance and his microscope and his scales and
measuring glasses When all the things were ready that Peter was to take
back the Doctor said suddenly

Youll excuse my shoving my oar in wont you But I should like to say
something to you

Now for a rowing thought Peter who had been wondering how it was
that he had escaped one

Something scientific added the Doctor

Yes said Peter fiddling with the fossil ammonite that the Doctor
used for a paperweight

Well then you see Boys and girls are only little men and women And
WE are much harder and hardier than they are Peter liked the we
Perhaps the Doctor had known he wouldand much stronger and things
that hurt THEM dont hurt US You know you mustnt hit a girl

I should think not indeed muttered Peter indignantly

Not even if shes your own sister Thats because girls are so much
softer and weaker than we are they have to be you know he added
because if they werent it wouldnt be nice for the babies And thats
why all the animals are so good to the mother animals They never fight
them you know

I know said Peter interested two buck rabbits will fight all day
if you let them but they wont hurt a doe

No and quite wild beastslions and elephantstheyre immensely
gentle with the female beasts And weve got to be too

I see said Peter

And their hearts are soft too the Doctor went on and things that
we shouldnt think anything of hurt them dreadfully So that a man has
to be very careful not only of his fists but of his words Theyre
awfully brave you know he went on Think of Bobbie waiting alone in
the tunnel with that poor chap Its an odd thingthe softer and more
easily hurt a woman is the better she can screw herself up to do what
HAS to be done Ive seen some brave womenyour Mothers one he ended
abruptly

Yes said Peter

Well thats all Excuse my mentioning it But nobody knows everything
without being told And you see what I mean dont you

Yes said Peter Im sorry There

Of course you are People always aredirectly they understand
Everyone ought to be taught these scientific facts So long

They shook hands heartily When Peter came home his sisters looked at
him doubtfully

Its Pax said Peter dumping down the basket on the table Dr
Forrest has been talking scientific to me No its no use my telling
you what he said you wouldnt understand But it all comes to you girls
being poor soft weak frightened things like rabbits so us men have
just got to put up with them He said you were female beasts Shall I
take this up to Mother or will you

I know what BOYS are said Phyllis with flaming cheeks theyre just
the nastiest rudest

Theyre very brave said Bobbie sometimes

Ah you mean the chap upstairs I see Go ahead PhilI shall put
up with you whatever you say because youre a poor weak frightened
soft

Not if I pull your hair you wont said Phyllis springing at him

He said Pax said Bobbie pulling her away Dont you see she
whispered as Peter picked up the basket and stalked out with it hes
sorry really only he wont say so Lets say were sorry

Its so goody goody said Phyllis doubtfully he said we were female
beasts and soft and frightened

Then lets show him were not frightened of him thinking us goody
goody said Bobbie and were not any more beasts than he is

And when Peter came back still with his chin in the air Bobbie said

Were sorry we tied you up Pete

I thought you would be said Peter very stiff and superior

This was hard to bear But

Well so we are said Bobbie Now let honour be satisfied on both
sides

I did call it Pax said Peter in an injured tone

Then let it BE Pax said Bobbie Come on Phil lets get the tea
Pete you might lay the cloth

I say said Phyllis when peace was really restored which was not
till they were washing up the cups after tea Dr Forrest didnt REALLY
say we were female beasts did he

Yes said Peter firmly but I think he meant we men were wild
beasts too

How funny of him said Phyllis breaking a cup

      

May I come in Mother Peter was at the door of Mothers writing room
where Mother sat at her table with two candles in front of her Their
flames looked orange and violet against the clear grey blue of the sky
where already a few stars were twinkling

Yes dear said Mother absently anything wrong She wrote a few
more words and then laid down her pen and began to fold up what she had
written I was just writing to Jims grandfather He lives near here
you know

Yes you said so at tea Thats what I want to say Must you write to
him Mother Couldnt we keep Jim and not say anything to his people
till hes well It would be such a surprise for them

Well yes said Mother laughing I think it would

You see Peter went on of course the girls are all right and all
thatIm not saying anything against THEM But I should like it if I
had another chap to talk to sometimes

Yes said Mother I know its dull for you dear But I cant
help it Next year perhaps I can send you to schoolyoud like that
wouldnt you

I do miss the other chaps rather Peter confessed but if Jim could
stay after his leg was well we could have awful larks

Ive no doubt of it said Mother Wellperhaps he could but you
know dear were not rich I cant afford to get him everything hell
want And he must have a nurse

Cant you nurse him Mother You do nurse people so beautifully

Thats a pretty compliment Petebut I cant do nursing and my writing
as well Thats the worst of it

Then you MUST send the letter to his grandfather

Of courseand to his schoolmaster too We telegraphed to them both
but I must write as well Theyll be most dreadfully anxious

I say Mother why cant his grandfather pay for a nurse Peter
suggested That would be ripping I expect the old boys rolling in
money Grandfathers in books always are

Well this one isnt in a book said Mother so we mustnt expect him
to roll much

I say said Peter musingly wouldnt it be jolly if we all WERE in
a book and you were writing it Then you could make all sorts of jolly
things happen and make Jims legs get well at once and be all right
tomorrow and Father come home soon and

Do you miss your Father very much Mother asked rather coldly Peter
thought

Awfully said Peter briefly

Mother was enveloping and addressing the second letter

You see Peter went on slowly you see its not only him BEING
Father but now hes away theres no other man in the house but
methats why I want Jim to stay so frightfully much Wouldnt you like
to be writing that book with us all in it Mother and make Daddy come
home soon

Peters Mother put her arm round him suddenly and hugged him in silence
for a minute Then she said

Dont you think its rather nice to think that were in a book that
Gods writing If I were writing the book I might make mistakes But
God knows how to make the story end just rightin the way thats best
for us

Do you really believe that Mother Peter asked quietly

Yes she said I do believe italmost alwaysexcept when Im so sad
that I cant believe anything But even when I cant believe it I know
its trueand I try to believe You dont know how I try Peter Now
take the letters to the post and dont lets be sad any more Courage
courage Thats the finest of all the virtues I dare say Jim will be
here for two or three weeks yet

For what was left of the evening Peter was so angelic that Bobbie feared
he was going to be ill She was quite relieved in the morning to find
him plaiting Phylliss hair on to the back of her chair in quite his old
manner

It was soon after breakfast that a knock came at the door The children
were hard at work cleaning the brass candlesticks in honour of Jims
visit

Thatll be the Doctor said Mother Ill go Shut the kitchen
dooryoure not fit to be seen

But it wasnt the Doctor They knew that by the voice and by the sound
of the boots that went upstairs They did not recognise the sound of the
boots but everyone was certain that they had heard the voice before

There was a longish interval The boots and the voice did not come down
again

Who can it possibly be they kept on asking themselves and each other

Perhaps said Peter at last Dr Forrest has been attacked by
highwaymen and left for dead and this is the man hes telegraphed for
to take his place Mrs Viney said he had a local tenant to do his work
when he went for a holiday didnt you Mrs Viney

I did so my dear said Mrs Viney from the back kitchen

Hes fallen down in a fit more likely said Phyllis all human aid
despaired of And this is his man come to break the news to Mother

Nonsense said Peter briskly Mother wouldnt have taken the man
up into Jims bedroom Why should she Listenthe doors opening Now
theyll come down Ill open the door a crack

He did

Its not listening he replied indignantly to Bobbies scandalised
remarks nobody in their senses would talk secrets on the stairs And
Mother cant have secrets to talk with Dr Forrests stablemanand you
said it was him

Bobbie called Mothers voice

They opened the kitchen door and Mother leaned over the stair railing

Jims grandfather has come she said wash your hands and faces and
then you can see him He wants to see you The bedroom door shut again

There now said Peter fancy us not even thinking of that Lets have
some hot water Mrs Viney Im as black as your hat

The three were indeed dirty for the stuff you clean brass candlesticks
with is very far from cleaning to the cleaner

They were still busy with soap and flannel when they heard the boots
and the voice come down the stairs and go into the diningroom And when
they were clean though still dampbecause it takes such a long time
to dry your hands properly and they were very impatient to see the
grandfatherthey filed into the diningroom

Mother was sitting in the windowseat and in the leathercovered
armchair that Father always used to sit in at the other house sat

 THEIR OWN OLD GENTLEMAN

Well I never did said Peter even before he said How do you do
He was as he explained afterwards too surprised even to remember that
there was such a thing as politenessmuch less to practise it

Its our own old gentleman said Phyllis

Oh its you said Bobbie And then they remembered themselves and
their manners and said How do you do very nicely

This is Jims grandfather Mr  said Mother naming the old
gentlemans name

How splendid said Peter thats just exactly like a book isnt it
Mother

It is rather said Mother smiling things do happen in real life
that are rather like books sometimes

I am so awfully glad it IS you said Phyllis when you think of the
tons of old gentlemen there are in the worldit might have been almost
anyone

I say though said Peter youre not going to take Jim away though
are you

Not at present said the old gentleman Your Mother has most kindly
consented to let him stay here I thought of sending a nurse but your
Mother is good enough to say that she will nurse him herself

But what about her writing said Peter before anyone could stop him
There wont be anything for him to eat if Mother doesnt write

Thats all right said Mother hastily

The old gentleman looked very kindly at Mother

I see he said you trust your children and confide in them

Of course said Mother

Then I may tell them of our little arrangement he said Your Mother
my dears has consented to give up writing for a little while and to
become a Matron of my Hospital

Oh said Phyllis blankly and shall we have to go away from Three
Chimneys and the Railway and everything

No no darling said Mother hurriedly

The Hospital is called Three Chimneys Hospital said the old
gentleman and my unlucky Jims the only patient and I hope hell
continue to be so Your Mother will be Matron and therell be a
hospital staff of a housemaid and a cooktill Jims well

And then will Mother go on writing again asked Peter

We shall see said the old gentleman with a slight swift glance at
Bobbie perhaps something nice may happen and she wont have to

I love my writing said Mother very quickly

I know said the old gentleman dont be afraid that Im going to try
to interfere But one never knows Very wonderful and beautiful things
do happen dont they And we live most of our lives in the hope of
them I may come again to see the boy

Surely said Mother and I dont know how to thank you for making it
possible for me to nurse him Dear boy

He kept calling Mother Mother in the night said Phyllis I woke up
twice and heard him

He didnt mean me said Mother in a low voice to the old gentleman
thats why I wanted so much to keep him

The old gentleman rose

Im so glad said Peter that youre going to keep him Mother

Take care of your Mother my dears said the old gentleman Shes a
woman in a million

Yes isnt she whispered Bobbie

God bless her said the old gentleman taking both Mothers hands
God bless her Ay and she shall be blessed Dear me wheres my hat
Will Bobbie come with me to the gate

At the gate he stopped and said

Youre a good child my dearI got your letter But it wasnt needed
When I read about your Fathers case in the papers at the time I had my
doubts And ever since Ive known who you were Ive been trying to find
out things I havent done very much yet But I have hopes my dearI
have hopes

Oh said Bobbie choking a little

YesI may say great hopes But keep your secret a little longer
Wouldnt do to upset your Mother with a false hope would it

Oh but it isnt false said Bobbie I KNOW you can do it I knew you
could when I wrote It isnt a false hope is it

No he said I dont think its a false hope or I wouldnt have told
you And I think you deserve to be told that there IS a hope

And you dont think Father did it do you Oh say you dont think he
did

My dear he said Im perfectly CERTAIN he didnt

If it was a false hope it was none the less a very radiant one that lay
warm at Bobbies heart and through the days that followed lighted her
little face as a Japanese lantern is lighted by the candle within



Chapter XIV The End


Life at the Three Chimneys was never quite the same again after the old
gentleman came to see his grandson Although they now knew his name
the children never spoke of him by itat any rate when they were by
themselves To them he was always the old gentleman and I think he had
better be the old gentleman to us too It wouldnt make him seem any
more real to you would it if I were to tell you that his name was
Snooks or Jenkins which it wasntand after all I must be allowed
to keep one secret Its the only one I have told you everything else
except what I am going to tell you in this chapter which is the last
At least of course I havent told you EVERYTHING If I were to do
that the book would never come to an end and that would be a pity
wouldnt it

Well as I was saying life at Three Chimneys was never quite the same
again The cook and the housemaid were very nice I dont mind telling
you their namesthey were Clara and Ethelwyn but they told Mother
they did not seem to want Mrs Viney and that she was an old muddler
So Mrs Viney came only two days a week to do washing and ironing Then
Clara and Ethelwyn said they could do the work all right if they werent
interfered with and that meant that the children no longer got the tea
and cleared it away and washed up the teathings and dusted the rooms

This would have left quite a blank in their lives although they
had often pretended to themselves and to each other that they hated
housework But now that Mother had no writing and no housework to do
she had time for lessons And lessons the children had to do However
nice the person who is teaching you may be lessons are lessons all the
world over and at their best are worse fun than peeling potatoes or
lighting a fire

On the other hand if Mother now had time for lessons she also had time
for play and to make up little rhymes for the children as she used
to do She had not had much time for rhymes since she came to Three
Chimneys

There was one very odd thing about these lessons Whatever the children
were doing they always wanted to be doing something else When Peter
was doing his Latin he thought it would be nice to be learning History
like Bobbie Bobbie would have preferred Arithmetic which was what
Phyllis happened to be doing and Phyllis of course thought Latin much
the most interesting kind of lesson And so on

So one day when they sat down to lessons each of them found a little
rhyme at its place I put the rhymes in to show you that their Mother
really did understand a little how children feel about things and also
the kind of words they use which is the case with very few grownup
people I suppose most grownups have very bad memories and have
forgotten how they felt when they were little Of course the verses are
supposed to be spoken by the children

 PETER

 I once thought Caesar easy pap
 How very soft I must have been
 When they start Caesar with a chap
 He little know what that will mean
 Oh verbs are silly stupid things
 Id rather learn the dates of kings

 BOBBIE

 The worst of all my lesson things
 Is learning who succeeded who
 In all the rows of queens and kings
 With dates to everything they do
 With dates enough to make you sick
 I wish it was Arithmetic

 PHYLLIS

 Such pounds and pounds of apples fill
 My slatewhat is the price youd spend
 You scratch the figures out until
 You cry upon the dividend
 Id break the slate and scream for joy
 If I did Latin like a boy

This kind of thing of course made lessons much jollier It is
something to know that the person who is teaching you sees that it is
not all plain sailing for you and does not think that it is just your
stupidness that makes you not know your lessons till youve learned
them

Then as Jims leg got better it was very pleasant to go up and sit with
him and hear tales about his school life and the other boys There
was one boy named Parr of whom Jim seemed to have formed the lowest
possible opinion and another boy named Wigsby Minor for whose views
Jim had a great respect Also there were three brothers named Paley and
the youngest was called Paley Terts and was much given to fighting

Peter drank in all this with deep joy and Mother seemed to have
listened with some interest for one day she gave Jim a sheet of paper
on which she had written a rhyme about Parr bringing in Paley and
Wigsby by name in a most wonderful way as well as all the reasons Jim
had for not liking Parr and Wigsbys wise opinion on the matter Jim
was immensely pleased He had never had a rhyme written expressly for
him before He read it till he knew it by heart and then he sent it to
Wigsby who liked it almost as much as Jim did Perhaps you may like it
too

 THE NEW BOY

 His name is Parr he says that he
 Is given bread and milk for tea
 He says his father killed a bear
 He says his mother cuts his hair

 He wears goloshes when its wet
 Ive heard his people call him Pet
 He has no proper sense of shame
 He told the chaps his Christian name

 He cannot wicketkeep at all
 Hes frightened of a cricket ball
 He reads indoors for hours and hours
 He knows the names of beastly flowers

 He says his French just like Mossoo
 A beastly stuckup thing to do
 He wont keep _cave_ shirks his turn
 And says he came to school to learn

 He wont play football says it hurts
 He wouldnt fight with Paley Terts
 He couldnt whistle if he tried
 And when we laughed at him he cried

 Now Wigsby Minor says that Parr
 Is only like all new boys are
 I know when _I_ first came to school
 I wasnt such a jolly fool

Jim could never understand how Mother could have been clever enough
to do it To the others it seemed nice but natural You see they had
always been used to having a mother who could write verses just like
the way people talk even to the shocking expression at the end of the
rhyme which was Jims very own

Jim taught Peter to play chess and draughts and dominoes and altogether
it was a nice quiet time

Only Jims leg got better and better and a general feeling began to
spring up among Bobbie Peter and Phyllis that something ought to be
done to amuse him not just games but something really handsome But it
was extraordinarily difficult to think of anything

Its no good said Peter when all of them had thought and thought
till their heads felt quite heavy and swollen if we cant think of
anything to amuse him we just cant and theres an end of it Perhaps
something will just happen of its own accord that hell like

Things DO happen by themselves sometimes without your making them
said Phyllis rather as though usually everything that happened in the
world was her doing

I wish something would happen said Bobbie dreamily something
wonderful

And something wonderful did happen exactly four days after she had said
this I wish I could say it was three days after because in fairy tales
it is always three days after that things happen But this is not a
fairy story and besides it really was four and not three and I am
nothing if not strictly truthful

They seemed to be hardly Railway children at all in those days and as
the days went on each had an uneasy feeling about this which Phyllis
expressed one day

I wonder if the Railway misses us she said plaintively We never go
to see it now

It seems ungrateful said Bobbie we loved it so when we hadnt
anyone else to play with

Perks is always coming up to ask after Jim said Peter and the
signalmans little boy is better He told me so

I didnt mean the people explained Phyllis I meant the dear Railway
itself

The thing I dont like said Bobbie on this fourth day which was a
Tuesday is our having stopped waving to the 915 and sending our love
to Father by it

Lets begin again said Phyllis And they did

Somehow the change of everything that was made by having servants in
the house and Mother not doing any writing made the time seem extremely
long since that strange morning at the beginning of things when they
had got up so early and burnt the bottom out of the kettle and had apple
pie for breakfast and first seen the Railway

It was September now and the turf on the slope to the Railway was dry
and crisp Little long grass spikes stood up like bits of gold wire
frail blue harebells trembled on their tough slender stalks Gipsy
roses opened wide and flat their lilaccoloured discs and the golden
stars of St Johns Wort shone at the edges of the pool that lay halfway
to the Railway Bobbie gathered a generous handful of the flowers and
thought how pretty they would look lying on the greenandpink blanket
of silkwaste that now covered Jims poor broken leg

Hurry up said Peter or we shall miss the 915

I cant hurry more than I am doing said Phyllis Oh bother it My
bootlace has come undone AGAIN

When youre married said Peter your bootlace will come undone going
up the church aisle and your man that youre going to get married to
will tumble over it and smash his nose in on the ornamented pavement
and then youll say you wont marry him and youll have to be an old
maid

I shant said Phyllis Id much rather marry a man with his nose
smashed in than not marry anybody

It would be horrid to marry a man with a smashed nose all the same
went on Bobbie He wouldnt be able to smell the flowers at the
wedding Wouldnt that be awful

Bother the flowers at the wedding cried Peter Look the signals
down We must run

They ran And once more they waved their handkerchiefs without at all
minding whether the handkerchiefs were clean or not to the 915

Take our love to Father cried Bobbie And the others too shouted

Take our love to Father

The old gentleman waved from his firstclass carriage window Quite
violently he waved And there was nothing odd in that for he always
had waved But what was really remarkable was that from every window
handkerchiefs fluttered newspapers signalled hands waved wildly The
train swept by with a rustle and roar the little pebbles jumped and
danced under it as it passed and the children were left looking at each
other

Well said Peter

WELL said Bobbie

_WELL_ said Phyllis

Whatever on earth does that mean asked Peter but he did not expect
any answer

_I_ dont know said Bobbie Perhaps the old gentleman told the
people at his station to look out for us and wave He knew we should
like it

Now curiously enough this was just what had happened The old
gentleman who was very well known and respected at his particular
station had got there early that morning and he had waited at the door
where the young man stands holding the interesting machine that clips
the tickets and he had said something to every single passenger who
passed through that door And after nodding to what the old gentleman
had saidand the nods expressed every shade of surprise interest
doubt cheerful pleasure and grumpy agreementeach passenger had gone
on to the platform and read one certain part of his newspaper And when
the passengers got into the train they had told the other passengers
who were already there what the old gentleman had said and then the
other passengers had also looked at their newspapers and seemed very
astonished and mostly pleased Then when the train passed the fence
where the three children were newspapers and hands and handkerchiefs
were waved madly till all that side of the train was fluttery with
white like the pictures of the Kings Coronation in the biograph at
Maskelyne and Cooks To the children it almost seemed as though the
train itself was alive and was at last responding to the love that they
had given it so freely and so long

It is most extraordinarily rum said Peter

Most stronery echoed Phyllis

But Bobbie said Dont you think the old gentlemans waves seemed more
significating than usual

No said the others

I do said Bobbie I thought he was trying to explain something to us
with his newspaper

Explain what asked Peter not unnaturally

_I_ dont know Bobbie answered but I do feel most awfully funny I
feel just exactly as if something was going to happen

What is going to happen said Peter is that Phylliss stocking is
going to come down

This was but too true The suspender had given way in the agitation of
the waves to the 915 Bobbies handkerchief served as first aid to the
injured and they all went home

Lessons were more than usually difficult to Bobbie that day Indeed she
disgraced herself so deeply over a quite simple sum about the division
of 48 pounds of meat and 36 pounds of bread among 144 hungry children
that Mother looked at her anxiously

Dont you feel quite well dear she asked

I dont know was Bobbies unexpected answer I dont know how
I feel It isnt that Im lazy Mother will you let me off lessons
today I feel as if I wanted to be quite alone by myself

Yes of course Ill let you off said Mother but

Bobbie dropped her slate It cracked just across the little green mark
that is so useful for drawing patterns round and it was never the same
slate again Without waiting to pick it up she bolted Mother caught her
in the hall feeling blindly among the waterproofs and umbrellas for her
garden hat

What is it my sweetheart said Mother You dont feel ill do you

I DONT know Bobbie answered a little breathlessly but I want to
be by myself and see if my head really IS all silly and my inside all
squirmytwisty

Hadnt you better lie down Mother said stroking her hair back from
her forehead

Id be more alive in the garden I think said Bobbie

But she could not stay in the garden The hollyhocks and the asters and
the late roses all seemed to be waiting for something to happen It was
one of those still shiny autumn days when everything does seem to be
waiting

Bobbie could not wait

Ill go down to the station she said and talk to Perks and ask
about the signalmans little boy

So she went down On the way she passed the old lady from the
Postoffice who gave her a kiss and a hug but rather to Bobbies
surprise no words except

God bless you love and after a pause run alongdo

The drapers boy who had sometimes been a little less than civil and
a little more than contemptuous now touched his cap and uttered the
remarkable words

Morning Miss Im sure

The blacksmith coming along with an open newspaper in his hand was
even more strange in his manner He grinned broadly though as a rule
he was a man not given to smiles and waved the newspaper long before
he came up to her And as he passed her he said in answer to her Good
morning

Good morning to you Missie and many of them I wish you joy that I
do

Oh said Bobbie to herself and her heart quickened its beats
something IS going to happen I know it iseveryone is so odd like
people are in dreams

The Station Master wrung her hand warmly In fact he worked it up and
down like a pumphandle But he gave her no reason for this unusually
enthusiastic greeting He only said

The 1154s a bit late Missthe extra luggage this holiday time
and went away very quickly into that inner Temple of his into which even
Bobbie dared not follow him

Perks was not to be seen and Bobbie shared the solitude of the platform
with the Station Cat This tortoiseshell lady usually of a retiring
disposition came today to rub herself against the brown stockings of
Bobbie with arched back waving tail and reverberating purrs

Dear me said Bobbie stooping to stroke her how very kind everybody
is todayeven you Pussy

Perks did not appear until the 1154 was signalled and then he like
everybody else that morning had a newspaper in his hand

Hullo he said ere you are Well if THIS is the train itll be
smart work Well God bless you my dear I see it in the paper and
I dont think I was ever so glad of anything in all my born days He
looked at Bobbie a moment then said One I must have Miss and no
offence I know on a day like this ere and with that he kissed her
first on one cheek and then on the other

You aint offended are you he asked anxiously I aint took too
great a liberty On a day like this you know

No no said Bobbie of course its not a liberty dear Mr Perks
we love you quite as much as if you were an uncle of oursbuton a day
like WHAT

Like this ere said Perks Dont I tell you I see it in the paper

Saw WHAT in the paper asked Bobbie but already the 1154 was
steaming into the station and the Station Master was looking at all the
places where Perks was not and ought to have been

Bobbie was left standing alone the Station Cat watching her from under
the bench with friendly golden eyes

Of course you know already exactly what was going to happen Bobbie was
not so clever She had the vague confused expectant feeling that comes
to ones heart in dreams What her heart expected I cant tellperhaps
the very thing that you and I know was going to happenbut her mind
expected nothing it was almost blank and felt nothing but tiredness
and stupidness and an empty feeling like your body has when you have
been a long walk and it is very far indeed past your proper dinnertime

Only three people got out of the 1154 The first was a countryman with
two baskety boxes full of live chickens who stuck their russet heads
out anxiously through the wicker bars the second was Miss Peckitt the
grocers wifes cousin with a tin box and three brownpaper parcels
and the third

Oh my Daddy my Daddy That scream went like a knife into the heart
of everyone in the train and people put their heads out of the windows
to see a tall pale man with lips set in a thin close line and a little
girl clinging to him with arms and legs while his arms went tightly
round her

      

I knew something wonderful was going to happen said Bobbie as they
went up the road but I didnt think it was going to be this Oh my
Daddy my Daddy

Then didnt Mother get my letter Father asked

There werent any letters this morning Oh Daddy it IS really you
isnt it

The clasp of a hand she had not forgotten assured her that it was You
must go in by yourself Bobbie and tell Mother quite quietly that its
all right Theyve caught the man who did it Everyone knows now that it
wasnt your Daddy

_I_ always knew it wasnt said Bobbie Me and Mother and our old
gentleman

Yes he said its all his doing Mother wrote and told me you had
found out And she told me what youd been to her My own little girl
They stopped a minute then

And now I see them crossing the field Bobbie goes into the house
trying to keep her eyes from speaking before her lips have found the
right words to tell Mother quite quietly that the sorrow and the
struggle and the parting are over and done and that Father has come
home

I see Father walking in the garden waitingwaiting He is looking at
the flowers and each flower is a miracle to eyes that all these months
of Spring and Summer have seen only flagstones and gravel and a little
grudging grass But his eyes keep turning towards the house And
presently he leaves the garden and goes to stand outside the nearest
door It is the back door and across the yard the swallows are
circling They are getting ready to fly away from cold winds and keen
frost to the land where it is always summer They are the same swallows
that the children built the little clay nests for

Now the house door opens Bobbies voice calls

Come in Daddy come in

He goes in and the door is shut I think we will not open the door or
follow him I think that just now we are not wanted there I think it
will be best for us to go quickly and quietly away At the end of the
field among the thin gold spikes of grass and the harebells and Gipsy
roses and St Johns Wort we may just take one last look over our
shoulders at the white house where neither we nor anyone else is wanted
now
