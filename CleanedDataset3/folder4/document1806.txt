THE FRAME UP

by Richard Harding Davis


When the voice over the telephone promised to name the man who killed
Hermann Banf District Attorney Wharton was uptown lunching at
Delmonicos This was contrary to his custom and a concession to
Hamilton Cutler his distinguished brotherinlaw That gentleman was
interested in a State constabulary bill and had asked State Senator
Bissell to father it He had suggested to the senator that in the legal
points involved in the bill his brotherinlaw would undoubtedly be
charmed to advise him So that morning to talk it over Bissell had
come from Albany and as he was forced to return the same afternoon had
asked Wharton to lunch with him uptown near the station

That in public life there breathed a man with soul so dead who were he
offered a chance to serve Hamilton Cutler would not jump at the chance
was outside the experience of the county chairman And in so judging his
fellow men with the exception of one man the senator was right The
one man was Hamilton Cutlers brotherinlaw

In the national affairs of his party Hamilton Cutler was one of the four
leaders In two cabinets he had held office At a foreign court as an
ambassador his dinners of which the diplomatic corps still spoke with
emotion had upheld the dignity of ninety million Americans He was
rich The history of his family was the history of the State When the
Albany boats drew abreast of the old Cutler mansion on the cast bank of
the Hudson the passengers pointed at it with deference Even when the
search lights pointed at it it was with deference And on Fifth
Avenue as the Seeing New York car passed his town house it slowed
respectfully to half speed When apparently for no other reason than
that she was good and beautiful he had married the sister of a then
unknown up State lawyer every one felt Hamilton Cutler had made his
first mistake But like every thing else into which he entered for him
matrimony also was a success The prettiest girl in Utica showed herself
worthy of her distinguished husband She had given him children as
beautiful as herself as what Washington calls a cabinet lady she had
kept her name out of the newspapers as Madame LAmbassatrice she had
put archduchesses at their ease and after ten years she was an adoring
wife a devoted mother and a proud woman Her pride was in believing
that for every joy she knew she was indebted entirely to her husband
To owe everything to him to feel that through him the blessings flowed
was her ideal of happiness

In this ideal her brother did not share Her delight in a sense of
obligation left him quite cold No one better than himself knew that
his rapidfire rise in public favor was due to his own exertions to the
fact that he had worked very hard had been independent had kept his
hands clean and had worn no mans collar Other people believed he owed
his advancement to his brotherinlaw He knew they believed that
and it hurt him When at the annual dinner of the Amen Corner they
burlesqued him as singing to Ham Cutler You made me what I am
today I hope youre satisfied he found that to laugh with the others
was something of an effort His was a difficult position He was a
party man he had always worked inside the organization The fact that
whenever he ran for an elective office the reformers indorsed him and
the best elements in the opposition parties voted for him did not shake
his loyalty to his own people And to Hamilton Cutler as one of his
party leaders as one of the bosses of the invisible government he
was willing to defer But while he could give allegiance to his party
leaders and from them was willing to receive the rewards of office
from a rich brotherinlaw he was not at all willing to accept anything
Still less was he willing that of the credit he deserved for years of
hard work for the party of selfdenial and of efficient public service
the rich brotherinlaw should rob him

His pride was to be known as a selfmade man as the servant only of the
voters And now that ambition now that he was district attorney of
New York City to have it said that the office was the gift of his
brotherinlaw was bitter But he believed the injustice would soon
end In a month he was coming up for reelection and night and day was
conducting a campaign that he hoped would result in a personal victory
so complete as to banish the shadow of his brotherinlaw Were he
reelected by the majority on which he counted he would have the party
leaders on their knees Hamilton Cutler would be forced to come to him
He would be in line for promotion He knew the leaders did not want
to promote him that they considered him too inclined to kick over the
traces but were he now reelected at the next election either for
mayor or governor he would be his partys obvious and legitimate
candidate

The reelection was not to be an easy victory Outside his own party
to prevent his succeeding himself as district attorney Tammany Hall
was using every weapon in her armory The commissioner of police was a
Tammany man and in the public prints Wharton had repeatedly declared
that Banf his star witness against the police had been killed by the
police and that they had prevented the discovery of his murderer For
this the wigwam wanted his scalp and to get it had raked his public and
private life had used threats and bribes and with women had tried to
trap him into a scandal But Big Tim Meehan the lieutenant the
Hall had detailed to destroy Wharton had reported back that for their
purpose his record was useless that bribes and threats only flattered
him and that the traps set for him he had smilingly sidestepped
This was the situation a month before election day when to oblige his
brotherinlaw Wharton was uptown at Delmonicos lunching with Senator
Bissell

Downtown at the office Rumson the assistant district attorney was
on his way to lunch when the telephonegirl halted him Her voice was
lowered and betrayed almost human interest

From the corner of her mouth she whispered This man has a note for Mr
Whartonsays if he dont get it quick itll be too latesays it will
tell him who killed Heimie Banf

The young man and the girl looked at each other and smiled Their
experience had not tended to make them credulous Had he lived Hermann
Banf would have been for Wharton the star witness against a ring of
corrupt police officials In consequence his murder was more than the
taking off of a shady and disreputable citizen It was a blow struck
at the high office of the district attorney at the grand jury and the
law But so far whoever struck the blow had escaped punishment and
though for a month ceaselessly by night and day the office and the
police had sought him he was still at large still unknown There had
been hundreds of clews They had been furnished by the detectives of
the city and county and of the private agencies by amateurs by
newspapers by members of the underworld with a score to pay off or to
gain favor But no clew had led anywhere When in hoarse whispers
the last one had been confided to him by his detectives Wharton had
protested indignantly

Stop bringing me clews he exclaimed I want the man I cant
electrocute a clew

So when after all other efforts over the telephone a strange voice
offered to deliver the murderer Rumson was skeptical He motioned the
girl to switch to the desk telephone

Assistant District Attorney Rumson speaking he said What can I do
for you

Before the answer came as though the speaker were choosing his words
there was a pause It lasted so long that Rumson exclaimed sharply

Hello he called Do you want to speak to me or do you want to speak
to me

Ive gotta letter for the district attorney said the voice Im to
give it to nobody but him Its about Banf He must get it quick or
itll be too late

Who are you demanded Rumson Where are you speaking from

The man at the other end of the wire ignored the questions

Wherell Wharton be for the next twenty minutes

If I tell you parried Rumson will you bring the letter at once
The voice exclaimed indignantly

Bring nothing Ill send it by district messenger Youre wasting time
trying to reach me Its the LETTER you want It tells the voice
broke with an oath and instantly began again I cant talk over a
phone I tell you its life or death If you lose out its your own
fault Where can I find Wharton

At Delmonicos answered Rumson Hell be there until two oclock
Delmonicos Thats Fortyfort Street Right said Rumson Tell the
messenger He heard the receiver slam upon the hook With the light
of the hunter in his eyes he turned to the girl

They can laugh he cried but I believe weve hooked something Im
going after it In the waitingroom he found the detectives Hewitt
he ordered take the subway and whip up to Delmonicos Talk to the
taxistarter till a messengerboy brings a letter for the D A Let the
boy deliver the note and then trail him till he reports to the man he
got it from Bring the man here If its a district messenger and he
doesnt report but goes straight back to the office find out who gave
him the note get his description Then meet me at Delmonicos

Rumson called up that restaurant and had Wharton come to the phone
He asked his chief to wait until a letter he believed to be of great
importance was delivered to him He explained but of necessity
somewhat sketchily It sounds to me commented his chief like a plot
of yours to get a lunch uptown

Invitation cried Rumson Ill be with you in ten minutes

After Rumson had joined Wharton and Bissell the note arrived It was
brought to the restaurant by a messengerboy who said that in answer to
a call from a saloon on Sixth Avenue he had received it from a young man
in readytowear clothes and a green hat When Hewitt the detective
asked what the young man looked like the boy said he looked like a
young man in readytowear clothes and a green hat But when the note
was read the identity of the man who delivered it ceased to be of
importance The paper on which it was written was without stamped
address or monogram and carried with it the mixed odors of the
drugstore at which it had been purchased The handwriting was that of a
woman and what she had written was If the district attorney will come
at once and alone to Kesslers Cafe on the Boston Post Road near the
city line he will be told who killed Hermann Banf If he dont come in
an hour it will be too late If he brings anybody with him he wont
be told anything Leave your car in the road and walk up the drive Ida
Earle

Hewitt who had sent away the messengerboy and had been called in to
give expert advice was enthusiastic

Mr District Attorney he cried thats no crank letter This
Earle woman is wise You got to take her as a serious proposition She
wouldnt make that play if she couldnt get away with it

Who is she asked Wharton

To the police the detective assured them Ida Earle had been known for
years When she was young she had been under the protection of a man
high in the ranks of Tammany and in consequence with her different
ventures the Police had never interfered She now was proprietress of
the roadhouse in the note described as Kesslers Cafe It was a place
for joyriders There was a cabaret a hall for public dancing and
rooms for very private suppers

In so far as it welcomed only those who could spend money it was
exclusive but in all other respects its reputation was of the worst In
situation it was lonely and from other houses separated by a quarter of
a mile of dying trees and vacant lots

The Boston Post Road upon which it faced was the old post road but
lately through this back yard and dumpingground of the city had been
relaid It was patrolled only and infrequently by bicycle policemen
But this continued the detective eagerly is where we win out The
roadhouse is an old farmhouse built over with the barns changed into
garages They stand on the edge of a wood Its about as big as a city
block If we come in through the woods from the rear the garages will
hide us Nobody in the house can see us but we wont be a hundred yards
away Youve only to blow a police whistle and well be with you

You mean I ought to go said Wharton

Rumson exclaimed incredulously You got to go

It looks to me objected Bissell like a plot to get you there alone
and rap you on the head Not with that note inviting him there
protested Hewitt and signed by Earle herself

You dont know she signed it objected the senator

I know her returned the detective I know shes no fool Its her
place and she wouldnt let them pull off any rough stuff therenot
against the D A anyway

The D A was rereading the note Might this be it he asked
Suppose its a trick to mix me up in a scandal You say the place is
disreputable Suppose theyre planning to compromise me just before
election Theyve tried it already several times

Youve still got the note persisted Hewitt It proves why you went
there And the senator too He can testify And we wont be hundred
yards away And he added grudgingly you have Nolan

Nolan was the spoiled child of the office He was the district
attorneys pet Although still young he had scored as a detective and
as a driver of racingcars As Whartons chauffeur he now doubled the
parts

What Nolan testified wouldnt be any help said Wharton They would
say it was just a story he invented to save me

Then square yourself this way urged Rumson Send a note now by hand
to Ham Cutler and one to your sister Tell them youre going to Ida
Earlesand whytell them youre afraid its a frameup and for them
to keep your notes as evidence And enclose the one from her

Wharton nodded in approval and while he wrote Rumson and the
detective planned how without those inside the roadhouse being aware
of their presence they might be near it

Kesslers Cafe lay in the Seventyninth Police Precinct In taxicabs
they arranged to start at once and proceed down White Plains Avenue
which parallels the Boston Road until they were on a line with
Kesslers but from it hidden by the woods and the garages A walk of a
quarter of a mile across lots and under cover of the trees would bring
them to within a hundred yards of the house

Wharton was to give them a start of half an hour That he might know
they were on watch they agreed after they dismissed the taxicabs to
send one of them into the Boston Post Road past the roadhouse When it
was directly in front of the cafe the chauffeur would throw away into
the road an empty cigarettecase

From the cigarstand they selected a cigarette box of a startling
yellow At half a mile it was conspicuous

When you see this in the road explained Rumson youll know were on
the job And after youre inside if you need us youve only to go to a
rear window and wave

If they mean to do him up growled Bissell he wont get to a rear
window

He can always tell them were outside said Rumsonand they are
extremely likely to believe him Do you want a gun

No said the D A

Better have mine urged Hewitt

I have my own explained the D A

 Rumson and Hewitt set off in taxicabs and a halfhour later
Wharton followed As he sank back against the cushions of the big
touringcar he felt a pleasing thrill of excitement and as he passed
the traffic police and they saluted mechanically he smiled Had they
guessed his errand their interest in his progress would have been less
perfunctory In half an hour he might know that the police killed Banf
in half an hour he himself might walk into a trap they had in turn
staged for him As the car ran swiftly through the clean October air
and the wind and sun alternately chilled and warmed his blood Wharton
considered these possibilities

He could not believe the woman Earle would lend herself to any plot to
do him bodily harm She was a responsible person In her own world
she was as important a figure as was the district attorney in his Her
allies were the man higher up in Tammany and the police of the upper
ranks of the uniformed force And of the higher office of the district
attorney she possessed an intimate and respectful knowledge It was
not to be considered that against the prosecuting attorney such a woman
would wage war So the thought that upon his person any assault was
meditated Wharton dismissed as unintelligent That it was upon his
reputation the attack was planned seemed much more probable But that
contingency he had foreseen and so he believed forestalled There then
remained only the possibility that the offer in the letter was genuine
It seemed quite too good to be true For as he asked himself on the
very eve of an election why should Tammany or a friend of Tammany
place in his possession the information that to the Tammany candidate
would bring inevitable defeat He felt that the way they were playing
into his hands was too open too generous If their object was to lead
him into a trap of all baits they might use the promise to tell him who
killed Banf was the one certain to attract him It made their invitation
to walk into the parlor almost too obvious But were the offer not
genuine there was a condition attached to it that puzzled him It was
not the condition that stipulated he should come alone His experience
had taught him many will confess or betray to the district attorney
who to a deputy will tell nothing The condition that puzzled him was
the one that insisted he should come at once or it would be too late

Why was haste so imperative Why if he delayed would he be too late
Was the man he sought about to escape from his jurisdiction was he
dying and was it his wish to make a deathbed confession or was he so
reluctant to speak that delay might cause him to reconsider and remain
silent

With these questions in his mind the minutes quickly passed and it
was with a thrill of excitement Wharton saw that Nolan had left the
Zoological Gardens on the right and turned into the Boston Road It had
but lately been completed and to Wharton was unfamiliar On either side
of the unscarred roadway still lay scattered the uprooted trees and
boulders that had blocked its progress and abandoned by the contractors
were empty tarbarrels cementsacks toolsheds and forges Nor
was the surrounding landscape less raw and unlovely Toward the Sound
stretched vacant lots covered with ash heaps to the left a few old and
broken houses set among the glasscovered cold frames of truckfarms

The district attorney felt a sudden twinge of loneliness And when an
automobile sign told him he was 10 miles from Columbus Circle he felt
that from the New York he knew he was much farther Two miles up the
road his car overhauled a bicycle policeman and Wharton halted him

Is there a roadhouse called Kesslers beyond here he asked

On the left farther up the officer told him and added You cant
miss it Mr Wharton theres no other house near it

You know me said the DA Then youll understand what I want you to
do Ive agreed to go to that house alone If they see you pass they may
think Im not playing fair So stop here

The man nodded and dismounted

But added the district attorney as the car started forward again
If you hear shots I dont care how fast you come

The officer grinned

Better let me trail along now he called thats a tough joint

But Wharton motioned him back and when again he turned to look the man
still stood where they had parted

Two minutes later an empty taxicab came swiftly toward him and as it
passed the driver lifted his hand from the wheel and with his thumb
motioned behind him

Thats one of the men said Nolan that started with Mr Rumson and
Hewitt from Delmonicos

Wharton nodded and now assured that in their plan there had been no
hitch smiled with satisfaction A moment later when ahead of them on
the asphalt road Nolan pointed out a spot of yellow he recognized the
signal and knew that within call were friends

The yellow cigarettebox lay directly in front of a long wooden building
of two stories It was linked to the road by a curving driveway marked
on either side by whitewashed stones

On verandas enclosed In glass Wharton saw whitecovered tables under
red candleshade and protruding from one end of the house and hung with
electric lights in paper lanterns a pavilion for dancing In the rear
of the house stood sheds and a thick tangle of trees on which the
autumn leaves showed yellow painted fingers and arrows pointing and an
electric sign proclaimed to all who passed that this was Kesslers In
spite of its reputation the house wore the aspect of the commonplace
In evidence nothing flaunted nothing threatened From a dozen other inns
along the Pelham Parkway and the Boston Post Road it was no way to be
distinguished

As directed in the note Wharton left the car in the road For five
minutes stay where you are he ordered Nolan then go to the bar and
get a drink Dont talk to any one or theyll think youre trying to get
information Work around to the back of the house Stand where I can see
you from the window I may want you to carry a message to Mr Rumson

On foot Wharton walked up the curved driveway and if from the house
his approach was spied upon there was no evidence In the second story
the blinds were drawn and on the first floor the verandas were empty
Nor not even after he had mounted to the veranda and stepped inside
the house was there any sign that his visit was expected He stood in a
hall and in front of him rose a broad flight of stairs that he guessed
led to the private supperrooms On his left was the restaurant

Swept and garnished after the revels of the night previous and as
though resting in preparation for those to come it an air of peaceful
inactivity At a table a maitre dhotel was composing the menu for the
evening against the walls three colored waiters lounged sleepily and
on a platform at a piano a pale youth with drugged eyes was with one
hand picking an accompaniment As Wharton paused uncertainly the young
man disdaining his audience in a shrill nasal tenor raised his voice
and sang

 And from the time the rooster calls Ill wear my overalls
 And you a simple gingham gown So if youre strong for a
shower of rice We two could make a paradise Of any OneHorse Town

At sight of Wharton the head waiter reluctantly detached himself from
his menu and rose But before he could greet the visitor Wharton heard
his name spoken and looking up saw a woman descending the stairs It
was apparent that when young she had been beautiful and in spite of an
expression in her eyes of hardness and distrust which seemed habitual
she was still handsome She was without a hat and wearing a house dress
of decorous shades and in the extreme of fashion Her black hair built
up in artificial waves was heavy with brilliantine her hands covered
deep with rings and of an unnatural white showed the most fastidious
care But her complexion was her own and her skin free from paint
and powder glowed with that healthy pink that is supposed to be the
perquisite only of the simple life and a conscience undisturbed

I am Mrs Earle said the woman I wrote you that note Will you
please come this way

That she did not suppose he might not come that way was obvious for as
she spoke she turned her back on him and mounted the stairs After an
instant of hesitation Wharton followed

As well as his mind his body was now acutely alive and vigilant Both
physically and mentally he moved on tiptoe For whatever surprise for
whatever ambush might lie in wait he was prepared At the top of the
stairs he found a wide hall along which on both sides were many doors
The one directly facing the stairs stood open At one side of this the
woman halted and with a gesture of the jewelled fingers invited him to
enter

My sittingroom she said As Wharton remained motionless she
substituted My office

Peering into the room Wharton found it suited to both titles He saw
comfortable chairs vases filled with autumn leaves in silver frames
photographs and between two open windows a businesslike rollertop
desk on which was a hand telephone In plain sight through the windows
he beheld the garage and behind it the tops of trees To summon Rumson
to keep in touch with Nolan he need only step to one of these windows
and beckon The strategic position of the room appealed and with a
bow of the head he passed in front of his hostess and entered it He
continued to take note of his surroundings

He now saw that from the office in which he stood doors led to rooms
adjoining These doors were shut and he determined swiftly that before
the interview began he first must know what lay behind them Mrs Earle
had followed and as she entered closed the door

No said Wharton

It was the first time he had spoken For an instant the woman hesitated
regarding him thoughtfully and then without resentment pulled the door
open She came toward him swiftly and he was conscious of the rustle of
silk and the stirring of perfumes At the open door she cast a frown of
disapproval and then with her face close to his spoke hurriedly in a
whisper

A man brought a girl here to lunch she said theyve been here
before The girl claims the man told her he was going to marry her
Last night she found out he has a wife already and she came here today
meaning to make trouble She brought a gun They were in the room at the
far end of the hall George the water heard the two shots and ran down
here to get me No one else heard These rooms are fixed to keep out
noise and the piano was going We broke in and found them on the floor
The man was shot through the shoulder the girl through the body His
story is that after she fired in trying to get the gun from her she
shot herselfby accident Thats right I guess But the girl says
they came here to die togetherwhat the newspaper call a suicide
pactbecause they couldnt marry and that he first shot her
intending to kill her and then himself Thats silly She framed it to
get him She missed him with the gun so now shes trying to get him
with this murder charge I know her If shed been sober she wouldnt
have shot him shed have blackmailed him Shes that sort I know her
and

 With an exclamation the district attorney broke in upon her And
the man he demanded eagerly was it HE killed Banf

In amazement the woman stared Certainly NOT she said

Then what HAS this to do with Banf

Nothing Her tone was annoyed reproachful That was only to bring
you here

His disappointment was so keen that it threatened to exhibit itself
in anger Recognizing this before he spoke Wharton forced himself to
pause Then he repeated her words quietly

Bring me here he asked Why

The woman exclaimed impatiently So you could beat the police to it
she whispered So you could HUSH IT UP

The surprised laugh of the man was quite real It bore no resentment or
pose He was genuinely amused Then the dignity of his office tricked
and insulted demanded to be heard He stared at her coldly his
indignation was apparent

You have done extremely ill he told her You know perfectly well
you had no right to bring me up here to drag me into a row in your
roadhouse Hush it up he exclaimed hotly This time his laugh was
contemptuous and threatening Ill show you how Ill hush it up He
moved quickly to the open window

Stop commanded the woman You cant do that She ran to the door

Again he was conscious of the rustle of silk of the stirring of
perfumes

He heard the key turn in the lock It had Come It was a frameup There
would be a scandal And to save himself from it they would force him
to hush up this other one But as to the outcome in no way was he
concerned Through the window standing directly below it he had seen
Nolan In the sunlit yard the chauffeur his cap on the back of his
head his cigarette drooping from his lips was tossing the remnants of
a sandwich to a circle of excited hens He presented a picture of bored
indolence of innocent preoccupation It was almost too well done

Assured of a witness for the defense he greeted the woman with a smile
Why cant I do it he taunted

She ran close to him and laid her hands on his arm Her eyes were
fixed steadily on his Because she whispered the man who shot that
girlis your brotherinlaw Ham Cutler

For what seemed a long time Wharton stood looking down into the eyes of
the woman and the eyes never faltered Later he recalled that in the
sudden silence many noises disturbed the lazy hush of the Indiansummer
afternoon the rush of a motorcar on the Boston Road the tinkle of
the piano and the voice of the youth with the drugged eyes singing And
youll wear a simple gingham gown from the yard below the cluckcluck
of the chickens and the cooing of pigeons

His first thought was of his sister and of her children and of what
this bomb hurled from the clouds would mean to her He thought
of Cutler at the height of his power and usefulness by this one
disreputable act dragged into the mire of what disaster it might bring
to the party to himself

If as the woman invited he helped to hush it up and Tammany learned
the truth it would make short work of him It would say for the
murderer of Banf he had one law and for the rich brotherinlaw who had
tried to kill the girl he deceived another But before he gave voice to
his thoughts he recognized them as springing only from panic They were
of a part with the acts of men driven by sudden fear and of which acts
in their sane moments they would be incapable

The shock of the womans words had unsettled his traditions Not only
was he condemning a man unheard but a man who though he might dislike
him he had for years for his private virtues trusted and admired The
panic passed and with a confident smile he shook his head

I dont believe you he said quietly

The manner of the woman was equally calm equally assured

Will you see her she asked

Id rather see my brotherinlaw he answered

The woman handed him a card

Doctor Muir took him to his private hospital she said I loaned them
my car because its a limousine The address is on that card But she
added both your brother and Sammythats Sam Muir the doctorasked
you wouldnt use the telephone theyre afraid of a leak

Apparently Wharton did not hear her As though it were Exhibit A
presented in evidence by the defense he was studying the card she had
given him He stuck it in his pocket

Ill go to him at once he said

To restrain or dissuade him the woman made no sudden move In level
tones she said

Your brotherinlaw asked especially that you wouldnt do that until
youd fixed it with the girl Your face is too well known Hes afraid
some one might find out where he isand for a day or two no one must
know that

This doctor knows it retorted Wharton

The suggestion seemed to strike Mrs Earle as humorous For the first
time she laughed Sammy she exclaimed Hes a lobbygow of mine Hes
worked for me for years I could send him up the river if I liked He
knows it Her tone was convincing They both asked she continued
evenly you should keep off until the girl is out of the country and
fixed Wharton frowned thoughtfully

And observing this the eyes of the woman showed that so far toward
the unfortunate incident the attitude of the district attorney was to
her most gratifying Wharton ceased frowning How fixed he asked
Mrs Earle shrugged her shoulders

Cutlers idea is money she said but believe me hes wrong This
girl is a vampire Shell only come back to you for more Shell keep on
threatening to tell the wife to tell the papers The way to fix her is
to throw a scare into her And theres only one man can do that theres
only one man that can hush this thing upthats you

When can I see her asked Wharton

Now said the woman Ill bring her Wharton could not suppress an
involuntary Here he exclaimed

For the shade of a second Mrs Earle exhibited the slightest evidence of
embarrassment

My rooms in a mess she explained and shes not hurt so much as
Sammy said He told her she was in bad just to keep her quiet until you
got here

Mrs Earle opened one of the doors leading from the room I wont be a
minute she said Quietly she closed the door behind her

Upon her disappearance the manner of the district attorney underwent an
abrupt change He ran softly to the door opposite the one through which
Mrs Earle had passed and pulled it open But if beyond it he expected
to find an audience of eavesdroppers he was disappointed The room was
empty and bore no evidence of recent occupation He closed the door
and from the rollertop desk snatching a piece of paper scribbled
upon it hastily Wrapping the paper around a coin and holding it
exposed to view he showed himself at the window Below him to an
increasing circle of hens and pigeons Nolan was still scattering
crumbs Without withdrawing his gaze from them the chauffeur nodded
Wharton opened his hand and the note fell into the yard Behind him he
heard the murmur of voices the sobs of a woman in pain and the rattle
of a doorknob As from the window he turned quickly he saw that toward
the spot where his note had fallen Nolan was tossing the last remnants
of his sandwich

The girl who entered with Mrs Earle leaning on her and supported by
her was tall and fair Around her shoulders her blond hair hung in
disorder and around her waist under the kimono Mrs Earle had
thrown about her were wrapped many layers of bandages The girl moved
unsteadily and sank into a chair

In a hostile tone Mrs Earle addressed her

Rose she said this is the district attorney To him she added
She calls herself Rose Gerard

One hand the girl held close against her side with the other she
brushed back the hair from her forehead From halfclosed eyes she
stared at Wharton defiantly

Well she challenged what about it

Wharton seated himself in front of the rollertop desk

Are you strong enough to tell me he asked

His tone was kind and this the girl seemed to resent

Dont you worry she sneered Im strong enough Strong enough to
tell all I knowto you and to the papers and to a juryuntil I get
justice She clinched her free hand and feebly shook it at him THATS
what Im going to get she cried her voice breaking hysterically
justice

From behind the armchair in which the girl halfreclined Mrs Earle
caught the eye of the district attorney and shrugged her shoulders

Just what DID happen asked Wharton

Apparently with an effort the girl pulled herself together

I first met your brotherinlaw she began

Wharton interrupted quietly

Wait he said You are not talking to me as anybodys brotherinlaw
but as the district attorney

The girl laughed vindictively

I dont wonder youre ashamed of him she jeered

Again she began I first met Ham Cutler last May He wanted to marry me
then He told me he was not a married man

As her story unfolded Wharton did not again interrupt and speaking
quickly in abrupt broken phrases the girl brought her narrative to
the moment when as she claimed Cutler had attempted to kill her
At this point a knock at the locked door caused both the girl and her
audience to start Wharton looked at Mrs Earle inquiringly but she
shook her head and with a look at him also of inquiry and of suspicion
as well opened the door

With apologies her head waiter presented a letter

For Mr Wharton he explained from his chauffeur

Whartons annoyance at the interruption was most apparent What the
devil he began

He read the note rapidly and with a frown of irritation raised his eyes
to Mrs Earle

He wants to go to New Rochelle for an inner tube he said How long
would it take him to get there and back

The hard and distrustful expression upon the face of Mrs Earle which
was habitual was now most strongly in evidence Her eyes searched those
of Wharton

Twenty minutes she said

He cant go snapped Wharton

Tell him he directed the waiter to stay where he is Tell him I
may want to go back to the office any minute He turned eagerly to the
girl Im sorry he said With impatience he crumpled the note into a
ball and glanced about him At his feet was a wastepaper basket Fixed
upon him he saw while pretending not to see the eyes of Mrs Earle
burning with suspicion If he destroyed the note he knew suspicion
would become certainty Without an instant of hesitation carelessly
he tossed it intact into the wastepaper basket Toward Rose Gerard he
swung the revolving chair

Go on Please he commanded

The girl had now reached the climax of her story but the eyes of
Mrs Earle betrayed the fact that her thoughts were elsewhere With
an intense and hungry longing they were concentrated upon her own
wastepaper basket

The voice of the girl in anger and defiance recalled Mrs Earle to the
business of the moment

He tried to kill me shouted Miss Rose And his shooting himself in
the shoulder was a bluff THATS my story thats the story Im going
to tell the judgeher voice soared shrillythats the story thats
going to send your brotherinlaw to Sing Sing

For the first time Mrs Earle contributed to the general conversation

You talk like a fish she said

The girl turned upon her savagely

If he dont like the way I talk she cried he can come across

Mrs Earle exclaimed in horror Virtuously her hands were raised in
protest

Like hell he will she said You cant pull that under my roof
Wharton looked disturbed

Come across he asked

Come across mimicked the girl Send me abroad and keep me there And
Ill swear it was an accident Twentyfive thousand thats all I want
Cutler told me he was going to make you governor He cant make you
governor if hes in Sing Sing can he Aint it worth twentyfive
thousand to you to be governor Come on she jeered kick in

With a grave but untroubled voice Wharton addressed Mrs Earle

May I use your telephone he asked He did not wait for her consent
but from the desk lifted the hand telephone

Spring three one hundred he said He sat with his legs comfortably
crossed the stand of the instrument balanced on his knee his eyes
gazing meditatively at the yellow treetops

If with apprehension both women started if the girl thrust herself
forward and by the hand of Mrs Earle was dragged back he did not
appear to know it

Police headquarters they heard him ask I want to speak to the
commissioner This is the district attorney

In the pause that followed as though to torment her the pain in her
side apparently turned for the girl screamed sharply

Be still commanded the older woman Breathless across the top of the
armchair she was leaning forward Upon the man at the telephone her
eyes were fixed in fascination

Commissioner said the district attorney this is Wharton speaking
A woman has made a charge of attempted murder to me against my
brotherinlaw Hamilton Cutler On account of our relationship I want
you to make the arrest If there were any slip and he got away it
might be said I arranged it You will find him at the Winona apartments
on the Southern Boulevard in the private hospital of a Doctor Samuel
Muir Arrest them both The girl who makes the charge is at Kesslers
Cafe on the Boston Post Road just inside the city line Arrest her
too She tried to blackmail me Ill appear against her

Wharton rose and addressed himself to Mrs Earle

Im sorry he said but I had to do it You might have known I could
not hush it up I am the only man who cant hush it up The people of
New York elected me to enforce the laws Whartons voice was raised to
a loud pitch It seemed unnecessarily loud It was almost as though he
were addressing another and more distant audience And he continued
his voice still soaring even if my own family suffer even if I
suffer even if I lose political promotion those laws I will enforce
In the more conventional tone of everyday politeness he added May I
speak to you outside Mrs Earle

But as in silence that lady descended the stairs the district attorney
seemed to have forgotten what it was he wished to say

It was not until he had seen his chauffeur arouse himself from
apparently deep slumber and crank the car that he addressed her

That girl he said had better go back to bed My men are all around
this house and until the police come will detain her

He shook the jewelled fingers of Mrs Earle warmly I thank you he
said I know you meant well I know you wanted to help me buthe
shrugged his shouldersmy duty

As he walked down the driveway to his car his shoulders continued to
move

But Mrs Earle did not wait to observe this phenomenon Rid of his
presence she leaped rather than ran up the stairs and threw open the
door of her office

As she entered two men followed her One was a young man who held in
his hand an open notebook the other was Tim Meehan of Tammany The
latter greeted her with a shout

We heard everything he said he cried His voice rose in torment An
we cant use a word of it He acted just like wed oughta knowed hed
act Hes HONEST Hes so damned honest he aint human hes agilded
saint

Mrs Earle did not heed him On her knees she was tossing to the floor
the contents of the wastepaper basket From them she snatched a piece
of crumpled paper

Shut up she shouted Listen His chauffeur brought him this In a
voice that quivered with indignation that sobbed with anger she read
aloud

As directed by your note from the window I went to the booth
and called up Mrs Cutlers house and got herself on the phone Your
brotherinlaw lunched at home today with her and the children and they
are now going to the Hippodrome

Stop look and listen Back of the bar I see two men in a room but
they did not see me One is Tim Meehan the other is a stenographer
He is taking notes Each of them has on the earmuffs of a dictagraph
Looks like youd better watch your step and not say nothing you dont
want Tammany to print The voice of Mrs Earle rose in a shrill
shriek

Hima gilded saint she screamed you big stiff He knew he was
talking into a dictagraph all the time and he doublecrossed us
