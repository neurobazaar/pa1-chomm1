PLAIN TALES FROM THE HILLS




LISPETH


 Look you have cast out Love What Gods are these
 You bid me please
 The Three in One the One in Three Not so
 To my own Gods I go
 It may be they shall give me greater ease
 Than your cold Christ and tangled Trinities

 The Convert


She was the daughter of Sonoo a Hillman and Jadeh his wife One
year their maize failed and two bears spent the night in their only
poppyfield just above the Sutlej Valley on the Kotgarth side so next
season they turned Christian and brought their baby to the Mission
to be baptized The Kotgarth Chaplain christened her Elizabeth and
Lispeth is the Hill or pahari pronunciation

Later cholera came into the Kotgarth Valley and carried off Sonoo and
Jadeh and Lispeth became halfservant halfcompanion to the wife of
the then Chaplain of Kotgarth This was after the reign of the Moravian
missionaries but before Kotgarth had quite forgotten her title of
Mistress of the Northern Hills

Whether Christianity improved Lispeth or whether the gods of her own
people would have done as much for her under any circumstances I do not
know but she grew very lovely When a Hill girl grows lovely she is
worth traveling fifty miles over bad ground to look upon Lispeth had a
Greek faceone of those faces people paint so often and see so seldom
She was of a pale ivory color and for her race extremely tall Also
she possessed eyes that were wonderful and had she not been dressed in
the abominable printcloths affected by Missions you would meeting her
on the hillside unexpectedly have thought her the original Diana of
the Romans going out to slay

Lispeth took to Christianity readily and did not abandon it when she
reached womanhood as do some Hill girls Her own people hated her
because she had they said become a memsahib and washed herself daily
and the Chaplains wife did not know what to do with her Somehow
one cannot ask a stately goddess five foot ten in her shoes to clean
plates and dishes So she played with the Chaplains children and took
classes in the Sunday School and read all the books in the house and
grew more and more beautiful like the Princesses in fairy tales The
Chaplains wife said that the girl ought to take service in Simla as a
nurse or something genteel But Lispeth did not want to take service
She was very happy where she was

When travellersthere were not many in those yearscame to Kotgarth
Lispeth used to lock herself into her own room for fear they might take
her away to Simla or somewhere out into the unknown world

One day a few months after she was seventeen years old Lispeth went
out for a walk She did not walk in the manner of English ladiesa mile
and a half out and a ride back again She covered between twenty and
thirty miles in her little constitutionals all about and about between
Kotgarth and Narkunda This time she came back at full dusk stepping
down the breakneck descent into Kotgarth with something heavy in her
arms The Chaplains wife was dozing in the drawingroom when Lispeth
came in breathing hard and very exhausted with her burden Lispeth put
it down on the sofa and said simply

This is my husband I found him on the Bagi Road He has hurt himself
We will nurse him and when he is well your husband shall marry him to
me

This was the first mention Lispeth had ever made of her matrimonial
views and the Chaplains wife shrieked with horror However the man on
the sofa needed attention first He was a young Englishman and his head
had been cut to the bone by something jagged Lispeth said she had found
him down the khud so she had brought him in He was breathing queerly
and was unconscious

He was put to bed and tended by the Chaplain who knew something of
medicine and Lispeth waited outside the door in case she could be
useful She explained to the Chaplain that this was the man she meant
to marry and the Chaplain and his wife lectured her severely on the
impropriety of her conduct Lispeth listened quietly and repeated her
first proposition It takes a great deal of Christianity to wipe out
uncivilized Eastern instincts such as falling in love at first sight
Lispeth having found the man she worshipped did not see why she should
keep silent as to her choice She had no intention of being sent away
either She was going to nurse that Englishman until he was well enough
to marry her This was her little programme

After a fortnight of slight fever and inflammation the Englishman
recovered coherence and thanked the Chaplain and his wife and
Lispethespecially Lispethfor their kindness He was a traveller in
the East he saidthey never talked about globetrotters in those
days when the P  O fleet was young and smalland had come from
Dehra Dun to hunt for plants and butterflies among the Simla hills No
one at Simla therefore knew anything about him He fancied he must
have fallen over the cliff while stalking a fern on a rotten treetrunk
and that his coolies must have stolen his baggage and fled He thought
he would go back to Simla when he was a little stronger He desired no
more mountaineering

He made small haste to go away and recovered his strength slowly
Lispeth objected to being advised either by the Chaplain or his wife
so the latter spoke to the Englishman and told him how matters stood in
Lispeths heart He laughed a good deal and said it was very pretty and
romantic a perfect idyl of the Himalayas but as he was engaged to a
girl at Home he fancied that nothing would happen Certainly he would
behave with discretion He did that Still he found it very pleasant to
talk to Lispeth and walk with Lispeth and say nice things to her and
call her pet names while he was getting strong enough to go away It
meant nothing at all to him and everything in the world to Lispeth She
was very happy while the fortnight lasted because she had found a man
to love

Being a savage by birth she took no trouble to hide her feelings and
the Englishman was amused When he went away Lispeth walked with him
up the Hill as far as Narkunda very troubled and very miserable The
Chaplains wife being a good Christian and disliking anything in
the shape of fuss or scandalLispeth was beyond her management
entirelyhad told the Englishman to tell Lispeth that he was coming
back to marry her She is but a child you know and I fear at heart
a heathen said the Chaplains wife So all the twelve miles up the
hill the Englishman with his arm around Lispeths waist was assuring
the girl that he would come back and marry her and Lispeth made him
promise over and over again She wept on the Narkunda Ridge till he had
passed out of sight along the Muttiani path

Then she dried her tears and went in to Kotgarth again and said to the
Chaplains wife He will come back and marry me He has gone to his
own people to tell them so And the Chaplains wife soothed Lispeth
and said He will come back At the end of two months Lispeth grew
impatient and was told that the Englishman had gone over the seas
to England She knew where England was because she had read little
geography primers but of course she had no conception of the nature
of the sea being a Hill girl There was an old puzzlemap of the World
in the House Lispeth had played with it when she was a child She
unearthed it again and put it together of evenings and cried to
herself and tried to imagine where her Englishman was As she had no
ideas of distance or steamboats her notions were somewhat erroneous It
would not have made the least difference had she been perfectly correct
for the Englishman had no intention of coming back to marry a Hill girl
He forgot all about her by the time he was butterflyhunting in Assam
He wrote a book on the East afterwards Lispeths name did not appear

At the end of three months Lispeth made daily pilgrimage to Narkunda
to see if her Englishman was coming along the road It gave her comfort
and the Chaplains wife finding her happier thought that she was
getting over her barbarous and most indelicate folly A little later
the walks ceased to help Lispeth and her temper grew very bad The
Chaplains wife thought this a profitable time to let her know the real
state of affairsthat the Englishman had only promised his love to keep
her quietthat he had never meant anything and that it was wrong and
improper of Lispeth to think of marriage with an Englishman who was of
a superior clay besides being promised in marriage to a girl of his own
people Lispeth said that all this was clearly impossible because he
had said he loved her and the Chaplains wife had with her own lips
asserted that the Englishman was coming back

How can what he and you said be untrue asked Lispeth

We said it as an excuse to keep you quiet child said the Chaplains
wife

Then you have lied to me said Lispeth you and he

The Chaplains wife bowed her head and said nothing Lispeth was
silent too for a little time then she went out down the valley and
returned in the dress of a Hill girlinfamously dirty but without the
nose and ear rings She had her hair braided into the long pigtail
helped out with black thread that Hill women wear

I am going back to my own people said she You have killed Lispeth
There is only left old Jadehs daughterthe daughter of a pahari and
the servant of Tarka Devi You are all liars you English

By the time that the Chaplains wife had recovered from the shock of the
announcement that Lispeth had verted to her mothers gods the girl had
gone and she never came back

She took to her own unclean people savagely as if to make up the
arrears of the life she had stepped out of and in a little time she
married a woodcutter who beat her after the manner of paharis and her
beauty faded soon

There is no law whereby you can account for the vagaries of the
heathen said the Chaplains wife and I believe that Lispeth was
always at heart an infidel Seeing she had been taken into the Church
of England at the mature age of five weeks this statement does not do
credit to the Chaplains wife

Lispeth was a very old woman when she died She always had a perfect
command of English and when she was sufficiently drunk could sometimes
be induced to tell the story of her first loveaffair

It was hard then to realize that the bleared wrinkled creature so like
a wisp of charred rag could ever have been Lispeth of the Kotgarth
Mission




THREE ANDAN EXTRA


 When halter and heel ropes are slipped do not give chase with
 sticks but with gram

 Punjabi Proverb


After marriage arrives a reaction sometimes a big sometimes a little
one but it comes sooner or later and must be tided over by both
parties if they desire the rest of their lives to go with the current

In the case of the CusackBremmils this reaction did not set in till the
third year after the wedding Bremmil was hard to hold at the best
of times but he was a beautiful husband until the baby died and Mrs
Bremmil wore black and grew thin and mourned as if the bottom of the
universe had fallen out Perhaps Bremmil ought to have comforted her He
tried to do so I think but the more he comforted the more Mrs Bremmil
grieved and consequently the more uncomfortable Bremmil grew The
fact was that they both needed a tonic And they got it Mrs Bremmil
can afford to laugh now but it was no laughing matter to her at the
time

You see Mrs Hauksbee appeared on the horizon and where she existed
was fair chance of trouble At Simla her byename was the Stormy
Petrel She had won that title five times to my own certain knowledge
She was a little brown thin almost skinny woman with big rolling
violetblue eyes and the sweetest manners in the world You had only to
mention her name at afternoon teas for every woman in the room to rise
up and call herwellNOT blessed She was clever witty brilliant
and sparkling beyond most of her kind but possessed of many devils of
malice and mischievousness She could be nice though even to her own
sex But that is another story

Bremmil went off at score after the babys death and the general
discomfort that followed and Mrs Hauksbee annexed him She took no
pleasure in hiding her captives She annexed him publicly and saw that
the public saw it He rode with her and walked with her and talked
with her and picnicked with her and tiffined at Pelitis with her
till people put up their eyebrows and said Shocking Mrs Bremmil
stayed at home turning over the dead babys frocks and crying into the
empty cradle She did not care to do anything else But some eight dear
affectionate ladyfriends explained the situation at length to her in
case she should miss the cream of it Mrs Bremmil listened quietly
and thanked them for their good offices She was not as clever as Mrs
Hauksbee but she was no fool She kept her own counsel and did not
speak to Bremmil of what she had heard This is worth remembering
Speaking to or crying over a husband never did any good yet

When Bremmil was at home which was not often he was more affectionate
than usual and that showed his hand The affection was forced partly to
soothe his own conscience and partly to soothe Mrs Bremmil It failed
in both regards

Then the ADC in Waiting was commanded by Their Excellencies Lord
and Lady Lytton to invite Mr and Mrs CusackBremmil to Peterhoff on
July 26th at 930 P MDancing in the bottomlefthand corner

I cant go said Mrs Bremmil it is too soon after poor little
Florrie but it need not stop you Tom

She meant what she said then and Bremmil said that he would go just to
put in an appearance Here he spoke the thing which was not and Mrs
Bremmil knew it She guesseda womans guess is much more accurate than
a mans certaintythat he had meant to go from the first and with Mrs
Hauksbee She sat down to think and the outcome of her thoughts was
that the memory of a dead child was worth considerably less than the
affections of a living husband She made her plan and staked her
all upon it In that hour she discovered that she knew Tom Bremmil
thoroughly and this knowledge she acted on

Tom said she I shall be dining out at the Longmores on the evening
of the 26th Youd better dine at the club

This saved Bremmil from making an excuse to get away and dine with
Mrs Hauksbee so he was grateful and felt small and mean at the same
timewhich was wholesome Bremmil left the house at five for a ride
About halfpast five in the evening a large leathercovered basket came
in from Phelps for Mrs Bremmil She was a woman who knew how to dress
and she had not spent a week on designing that dress and having it
gored and hemmed and herringboned and tucked and rucked or whatever
the terms are for nothing It was a gorgeous dressslight mourning I
cant describe it but it was what The Queen calls a creationa thing
that hit you straight between the eyes and made you gasp She had not
much heart for what she was going to do but as she glanced at the long
mirror she had the satisfaction of knowing that she had never looked so
well in her life She was a large blonde and when she chose carried
herself superbly

After the dinner at the Longmores she went on to the dancea little
lateand encountered Bremmil with Mrs Hauksbee on his arm That
made her flush and as the men crowded round her for dances she looked
magnificent She filled up all her dances except three and those she
left blank Mrs Hauksbee caught her eye once and she knew it was
warreal warbetween them She started handicapped in the struggle
for she had ordered Bremmil about just the least little bit in the world
too much and he was beginning to resent it Moreover he had never seen
his wife look so lovely He stared at her from doorways and glared at
her from passages as she went about with her partners and the more he
stared the more taken was he He could scarcely believe that this was
the woman with the red eyes and the black stuff gown who used to weep
over the eggs at breakfast

Mrs Hauksbee did her best to hold him in play but after two dances
he crossed over to his wife and asked for a dance

Im afraid youve come too late MISTER Bremmil she said with her
eyes twinkling

Then he begged her to give him a dance and as a great favor she
allowed him the fifth waltz Luckily 5 stood vacant on his programme
They danced it together and there was a little flutter round the room
Bremmil had a sort of notion that his wife could dance but he never
knew she danced so divinely At the end of that waltz he asked for
anotheras a favor not as a right and Mrs Bremmil said Show me
your programme dear He showed it as a naughty little schoolboy hands
up contraband sweets to a master There was a fair sprinkling of H
on it besides H at supper Mrs Bremmil said nothing but she smiled
contemptuously ran her pencil through 7 and 9two Hsand returned
the card with her own name written abovea pet name that only she and
her husband used Then she shook her finger at him and said laughing
Oh you silly SILLY boy

Mrs Hauksbee heard that andshe owned as muchfelt that she had the
worst of it Bremmil accepted 7 and 9 gratefully They danced 7 and
sat out 9 in one of the little tents What Bremmil said and what Mrs
Bremmil said is no concern of any ones

When the band struck up The Roast Beef of Old England the two went
out into the verandah and Bremmil began looking for his wifes dandy
this was before rickshaw days while she went into the cloakroom
Mrs Hauksbee came up and said You take me in to supper I think Mr
Bremmil Bremmil turned red and looked foolish Ahhm Im going
home with my wife Mrs Hauksbee I think there has been a little
mistake Being a man he spoke as though Mrs Hauksbee were entirely
responsible

Mrs Bremmil came out of the cloakroom in a swansdown cloak with a
white cloud round her head She looked radiant and she had a right
to

The couple went off in the darkness together Bremmil riding very close
to the dandy

Then says Mrs Hauksbee to meshe looked a trifle faded and jaded in
the lamplight Take my word for it the silliest woman can manage a
clever man but it needs a very clever woman to manage a fool

Then we went in to supper




THROWN AWAY


 And some are sulky while some will plunge
 So ho Steady Stand still you
 Some you must gentle and some you must lunge
 There There Who wants to kill you
 Somethere are losses in every trade
 Will break their hearts ere bitted and made
 Will fight like fiends as the rope cuts hard
 And die dumbmad in the breakingyard

 Toolungala Stockyard Chorus


To rear a boy under what parents call the sheltered life system is if
the boy must go into the world and fend for himself not wise Unless he
be one in a thousand he has certainly to pass through many unnecessary
troubles and may possibly come to extreme grief simply from ignorance
of the proper proportions of things

Let a puppy eat the soap in the bathroom or chew a newlyblacked boot
He chews and chuckles until by and by he finds out that blacking and
Old Brown Windsor make him very sick so he argues that soap and boots
are not wholesome Any old dog about the house will soon show him the
unwisdom of biting big dogs ears Being young he remembers and goes
abroad at six months a wellmannered little beast with a chastened
appetite If he had been kept away from boots and soap and big dogs
till he came to the trinity fullgrown and with developed teeth just
consider how fearfully sick and thrashed he would be Apply that motion
to the sheltered life and see how it works It does not sound pretty
but it is the better of two evils

There was a Boy once who had been brought up under the sheltered life
theory and the theory killed him dead He stayed with his people all
his days from the hour he was born till the hour he went into Sandhurst
nearly at the top of the list He was beautifully taught in all that
wins marks by a private tutor and carried the extra weight of never
having given his parents an hours anxiety in his life What he learnt
at Sandhurst beyond the regular routine is of no great consequence
He looked about him and he found soap and blacking so to speak very
good He ate a little and came out of Sandhurst not so high as he went
in Then there was an interval and a scene with his people who expected
much from him Next a year of living unspotted from the world in a
thirdrate depot battalion where all the juniors were children and all
the seniors old women and lastly he came out to India where he was cut
off from the support of his parents and had no one to fall back on in
time of trouble except himself

Now India is a place beyond all others where one must not take things
too seriouslythe midday sun always excepted Too much work and too
much energy kill a man just as effectively as too much assorted vice or
too much drink Flirtation does not matter because every one is being
transferred and either you or she leave the Station and never return
Good work does not matter because a man is judged by his worst output
and another man takes all the credit of his best as a rule Bad work
does not matter because other men do worse and incompetents hang on
longer in India than anywhere else Amusements do not matter because
you must repeat them as soon as you have accomplished them once and
most amusements only mean trying to win another persons money Sickness
does not matter because its all in the days work and if you die
another man takes over your place and your office in the eight hours
between death and burial Nothing matters except Home furlough and
acting allowances and these only because they are scarce This is a
slack kutcha country where all men work with imperfect instruments and
the wisest thing is to take no one and nothing in earnest but to escape
as soon as ever you can to some place where amusement is amusement and a
reputation worth the having

But this Boythe tale is as old as the Hillscame out and took all
things seriously He was pretty and was petted He took the pettings
seriously and fretted over women not worth saddling a pony to call
upon He found his new free life in India very good It DOES look
attractive in the beginning from a Subalterns point of viewall
ponies partners dancing and so on He tasted it as the puppy tastes
the soap Only he came late to the eating with a growing set of
teeth He had no sense of balancejust like the puppyand could not
understand why he was not treated with the consideration he received
under his fathers roof This hurt his feelings

He quarrelled with other boys and being sensitive to the marrow
remembered these quarrels and they excited him He found whist and
gymkhanas and things of that kind meant to amuse one after office
good but he took them seriously too just as he took the head that
followed after drink He lost his money over whist and gymkhanas because
they were new to him

He took his losses seriously and wasted as much energy and interest
over a twogoldmohur race for maiden ekkaponies with their manes
hogged as if it had been the Derby Onehalf of this came from
inexperiencemuch as the puppy squabbles with the corner of the
hearthrugand the other half from the dizziness bred by stumbling out
of his quiet life into the glare and excitement of a livelier one No
one told him about the soap and the blacking because an average man
takes it for granted that an average man is ordinarily careful in regard
to them It was pitiful to watch The Boy knocking himself to pieces as
an overhandled colt falls down and cuts himself when he gets away from
the groom

This unbridled license in amusements not worth the trouble of breaking
line for much less rioting over endured for six monthsall through
one cold weatherand then we thought that the heat and the knowledge
of having lost his money and health and lamed his horses would sober
The Boy down and he would stand steady In ninetynine cases out of a
hundred this would have happened You can see the principle working in
any Indian Station But this particular case fell through because The
Boy was sensitive and took things seriouslyas I may have said some
seven times before Of course we couldnt tell how his excesses struck
him personally They were nothing very heartbreaking or above the
average He might be crippled for life financially and want a little
nursing Still the memory of his performances would wither away in
one hot weather and the shroff would help him to tide over the money
troubles But he must have taken another view altogether and have
believed himself ruined beyond redemption His Colonel talked to him
severely when the cold weather ended That made him more wretched than
ever and it was only an ordinary Colonels wigging

What follows is a curious instance of the fashion in which we are all
linked together and made responsible for one another THE thing that
kicked the beam in The Boys mind was a remark that a woman made when he
was talking to her There is no use in repeating it for it was only a
cruel little sentence rapped out before thinking that made him flush
to the roots of his hair He kept himself to himself for three days and
then put in for two days leave to go shooting near a Canal Engineers
Rest House about thirty miles out He got his leave and that night
at Mess was noisier and more offensive than ever He said that he was
going to shoot big game and left at halfpast ten oclock in an
ekka Partridgewhich was the only thing a man could get near the Rest
Houseis not big game so every one laughed

Next morning one of the Majors came in from short leave and heard
that The Boy had gone out to shoot big game The Major had taken an
interest in The Boy and had more than once tried to check him in
the cold weather The Major put up his eyebrows when he heard of the
expedition and went to The Boys room where he rummaged

Presently he came out and found me leaving cards on the Mess There was
no one else in the anteroom

He said The Boy has gone out shooting DOES a man shoot tetur with a
revolver and a writingcase

I said Nonsense Major for I saw what was in his mind

He said Nonsense or nonsense Im going to the Canal nowat once I
dont feel easy

Then he thought for a minute and said Can you lie

You know best I answered Its my profession

Very well said the Major you must come out with me nowat
oncein an ekka to the Canal to shoot blackbuck Go and put on
shikarkitquickand drive here with a gun

The Major was a masterful man and I knew that he would not give orders
for nothing So I obeyed and on return found the Major packed up in an
ekkaguncases and food slung belowall ready for a shootingtrip

He dismissed the driver and drove himself We jogged along quietly
while in the station but as soon as we got to the dusty road across the
plains he made that pony fly A countrybred can do nearly anything at
a pinch We covered the thirty miles in under three hours but the poor
brute was nearly dead

Once I said Whats the blazing hurry Major

He said quietly The Boy has been alone by himself forone two
fivefourteen hours now I tell you I dont feel easy

This uneasiness spread itself to me and I helped to beat the pony

When we came to the Canal Engineers Rest House the Major called for The
Boys servant but there was no answer Then we went up to the house
calling for The Boy by name but there was no answer

Oh hes out shooting said I

Just then I saw through one of the windows a little hurricanelamp
burning This was at four in the afternoon We both stopped dead in the
verandah holding our breath to catch every sound and we heard inside
the room the brrbrrbrr of a multitude of flies The Major said
nothing but he took off his helmet and we entered very softly

The Boy was dead on the charpoy in the centre of the bare limewashed
room He had shot his head nearly to pieces with his revolver The
guncases were still strapped so was the bedding and on the table lay
The Boys writingcase with photographs He had gone away to die like a
poisoned rat

The Major said to himself softly Poor Boy Poor POOR devil Then he
turned away from the bed and said I want your help in this business

Knowing The Boy was dead by his own hand I saw exactly what that help
would be so I passed over to the table took a chair lit a cheroot
and began to go through the writingcase the Major looking over my
shoulder and repeating to himself We came too lateLike a rat in a
holePoor POOR devil

The Boy must have spent half the night in writing to his people and to
his Colonel and to a girl at Home and as soon as he had finished must
have shot himself for he had been dead a long time when we came in

I read all that he had written and passed over each sheet to the Major
as I finished it

We saw from his accounts how very seriously he had taken everything
He wrote about disgrace which he was unable to bearindelible
shamecriminal follywasted life and so on besides a lot of
private things to his Father and Mother too much too sacred to put into
print The letter to the girl at Home was the most pitiful of all and
I choked as I read it The Major made no attempt to keep dryeyed
I respected him for that He read and rocked himself to and fro and
simply cried like a woman without caring to hide it The letters were so
dreary and hopeless and touching We forgot all about The Boys follies
and only thought of the poor Thing on the charpoy and the scrawled
sheets in our hands It was utterly impossible to let the letters go
Home They would have broken his Fathers heart and killed his Mother
after killing her belief in her son

At last the Major dried his eyes openly and said Nice sort of thing
to spring on an English family What shall we do

I said knowing what the Major had brought me but for The Boy died
of cholera We were with him at the time We cant commit ourselves to
halfmeasures Come along

Then began one of the most grimy comic scenes I have ever taken part
inthe concoction of a big written lie bolstered with evidence to
soothe The Boys people at Home I began the rough draft of a letter
the Major throwing in hints here and there while he gathered up all the
stuff that The Boy had written and burnt it in the fireplace It was a
hot still evening when we began and the lamp burned very badly In due
course I got the draft to my satisfaction setting forth how The Boy was
the pattern of all virtues beloved by his regiment with every promise
of a great career before him and so on how we had helped him through
the sicknessit was no time for little lies you will understandand
how he had died without pain I choked while I was putting down these
things and thinking of the poor people who would read them Then I
laughed at the grotesqueness of the affair and the laughter mixed
itself up with the chokeand the Major said that we both wanted drinks

I am afraid to say how much whiskey we drank before the letter was
finished It had not the least effect on us Then we took off The Boys
watch locket and rings

Lastly the Major said We must send a lock of hair too A woman values
that

But there were reasons why we could not find a lock fit to send The Boy
was blackhaired and so was the Major luckily I cut off a piece of
the Majors hair above the temple with a knife and put it into the
packet we were making The laughingfit and the chokes got hold of me
again and I had to stop The Major was nearly as bad and we both knew
that the worst part of the work was to come

We sealed up the packet photographs locket seals ring letter and
lock of hair with The Boys sealingwax and The Boys seal

Then the Major said For Gods sake lets get outsideaway from the
roomand think

We went outside and walked on the banks of the Canal for an hour
eating and drinking what we had with us until the moon rose I know now
exactly how a murderer feels Finally we forced ourselves back to the
room with the lamp and the Other Thing in it and began to take up
the next piece of work I am not going to write about this It was too
horrible We burned the bedstead and dropped the ashes into the Canal
we took up the matting of the room and treated that in the same way
I went off to a village and borrowed two big hoesI did not want the
villagers to helpwhile the Major arrangedthe other matters It took
us four hours hard work to make the grave As we worked we argued out
whether it was right to say as much as we remembered of the Burial
of the Dead We compromised things by saying the Lords Prayer with a
private unofficial prayer for the peace of the soul of The Boy Then we
filled in the grave and went into the verandahnot the houseto lie
down to sleep We were deadtired

When we woke the Major said wearily We cant go back till tomorrow
We must give him a decent time to die in He died early THIS morning
remember That seems more natural So the Major must have been lying
awake all the time thinking

I said Then why didnt we bring the body back to the cantonments

The Major thought for a minuteBecause the people bolted when they
heard of the cholera And the ekka has gone

That was strictly true We had forgotten all about the ekkapony and he
had gone home

So we were left there alone all that stifling day in the Canal Rest
House testing and retesting our story of The Boys death to see if it
was weak at any point A native turned up in the afternoon but we said
that a Sahib was dead of cholera and he ran away As the dusk gathered
the Major told me all his fears about The Boy and awful stories of
suicide or nearlycarriedout suicidetales that made ones hair crisp
He said that he himself had once gone into the same Valley of the Shadow
as the Boy when he was young and new to the country so he understood
how things fought together in The Boys poor jumbled head He also said
that youngsters in their repentant moments consider their sins much
more serious and ineffaceable than they really are We talked together
all through the evening and rehearsed the story of the death of The
Boy As soon as the moon was up and The Boy theoretically just
buried we struck across country for the Station We walked from eight
till six oclock in the morning but though we were deadtired we did
not forget to go to The Boys room and put away his revolver with the
proper amount of cartridges in the pouch Also to set his writingcase
on the table We found the Colonel and reported the death feeling more
like murderers than ever Then we went to bed and slept the clock round
for there was no more in us

The tale had credence as long as was necessary for every one forgot
about The Boy before a fortnight was over Many people however found
time to say that the Major had behaved scandalously in not bringing in
the body for a regimental funeral The saddest thing of all was a letter
from The Boys mother to the Major and mewith big inky blisters all
over the sheet She wrote the sweetest possible things about our great
kindness and the obligation she would be under to us as long as she
lived

All things considered she WAS under an obligation but not exactly as
she meant




MISS YOUGHALS SAIS


 When Man and Woman are agreed what can the Kazi do

 Mahomedan Proverb


Some people say that there is no romance in India Those people are
wrong Our lives hold quite as much romance as is good for us Sometimes
more

Strickland was in the Police and people did not understand him so
they said he was a doubtful sort of man and passed by on the other side
Strickland had himself to thank for this He held the extraordinary
theory that a Policeman in India should try to know as much about the
natives as the natives themselves Now in the whole of Upper India
there is only ONE man who can pass for Hindu or Mohammedan chamar or
faquir as he pleases He is feared and respected by the natives from
the Ghor Kathri to the Jamma Musjid and he is supposed to have the gift
of invisibility and executive control over many Devils But what good
has this done him with the Government None in the world He has never
got Simla for his charge and his name is almost unknown to Englishmen

Strickland was foolish enough to take that man for his model and
following out his absurd theory dabbled in unsavory places no
respectable man would think of exploringall among the native
riffraff He educated himself in this peculiar way for seven years and
people could not appreciate it He was perpetually going Fantee among
the natives which of course no man with any sense believes in He was
initiated into the Sat Bhai at Allahabad once when he was on leave he
knew the LizardSong of the Sansis and the HalliHukk dance which is
a religious cancan of a startling kind When a man knows who dances the
HalliHukk and how and when and where he knows something to be proud
of He has gone deeper than the skin But Strickland was not proud
though he had helped once at Jagadhri at the Painting of the Death
Bull which no Englishman must even look upon had mastered the
thievespatter of the changars had taken a Eusufzai horsethief alone
near Attock and had stood under the mimbarboard of a Border mosque and
conducted service in the manner of a Sunni Mollah

His crowning achievement was spending eleven days as a faquir in the
gardens of Baba Atal at Amritsar and there picking up the threads of
the great Nasiban Murder Case But people said justly enough Why on
earth cant Strickland sit in his office and write up his diary and
recruit and keep quiet instead of showing up the incapacity of his
seniors So the Nasiban Murder Case did him no good departmentally
but after his first feeling of wrath he returned to his outlandish
custom of prying into native life By the way when a man once acquires
a taste for this particular amusement it abides with him all his days
It is the most fascinating thing in the world Love not excepted Where
other men took ten days to the Hills Strickland took leave for what
he called shikar put on the disguise that appealed to him at the time
stepped down into the brown crowd and was swallowed up for a while He
was a quiet dark young fellowspare blackeyesand when he was not
thinking of something else a very interesting companion Strickland
on Native Progress as he had seen it was worth hearing Natives hated
Strickland but they were afraid of him He knew too much

When the Youghals came into the station Stricklandvery gravely as he
did everythingfell in love with Miss Youghal and she after a
while fell in love with him because she could not understand him Then
Strickland told the parents but Mrs Youghal said she was not going to
throw her daughter into the worst paid Department in the Empire and old
Youghal said in so many words that he mistrusted Stricklands ways
and works and would thank him not to speak or write to his daughter
any more Very well said Strickland for he did not wish to make
his ladyloves life a burden After one long talk with Miss Youghal he
dropped the business entirely

The Youghals went up to Simla in April

In July Strickland secured three months leave on urgent private
affairs He locked up his housethough not a native in the Providence
would wittingly have touched Estreekin Sahibs gear for the worldand
went down to see a friend of his an old dyer at Tarn Taran

Here all trace of him was lost until a sais met me on the Simla Mall
with this extraordinary note


Dear old man

Please give bearer a box of cherootsSupers No I for preference
They are freshest at the Club Ill repay when I reappear but at
present Im out of Society

Yours

E STRICKLAND


I ordered two boxes and handed them over to the sais with my love That
sais was Strickland and he was in old Youghals employ attached to
Miss Youghals Arab The poor fellow was suffering for an English
smoke and knew that whatever happened I should hold my tongue till the
business was over

Later on Mrs Youghal who was wrapped up in her servants began
talking at houses where she called of her paragon among saisesthe man
who was never too busy to get up in the morning and pick flowers for
the breakfasttable and who blackedactually BLACKEDthe hoofs of his
horse like a London coachman The turnout of Miss Youghals Arab was a
wonder and a delight StricklandDulloo I meanfound his reward
in the pretty things that Miss Youghal said to him when she went out
riding Her parents were pleased to find she had forgotten all her
foolishness for young Strickland and said she was a good girl

Strickland vows that the two months of his service were the most rigid
mental discipline he has ever gone through Quite apart from the little
fact that the wife of one of his fellowsaises fell in love with him and
then tried to poison him with arsenic because he would have nothing
to do with her he had to school himself into keeping quiet when Miss
Youghal went out riding with some man who tried to flirt with her and
he was forced to trot behind carrying the blanket and hearing every
word Also he had to keep his temper when he was slanged in Benmore
porch by a policemanespecially once when he was abused by a Naik he
had himself recruited from Isser Jang villageor worse still when a
young subaltern called him a pig for not making way quickly enough

But the life had its compensations He obtained great insight into the
ways and thefts of saisesenough he says to have summarily convicted
half the chamar population of the Punjab if he had been on business He
became one of the leading players at knucklebones which all jhampanis
and many saises play while they are waiting outside the Government House
or the Gaiety Theatre of nights he learned to smoke tobacco that was
threefourths cowdung and he heard the wisdom of the grizzled Jemadar
of the Government House saises whose words are valuable He saw many
things which amused him and he states on honor that no man can
appreciate Simla properly till he has seen it from the saiss point of
view He also says that if he chose to write all he saw his head would
be broken in several places

Stricklands account of the agony he endured on wet nights hearing the
music and seeing the lights in Benmore with his toes tingling for a
waltz and his head in a horseblanket is rather amusing One of these
days Strickland is going to write a little book on his experiences
That book will be worth buying and even more worth suppressing

Thus he served faithfully as Jacob served for Rachel and his leave was
nearly at an end when the explosion came He had really done his best to
keep his temper in the hearing of the flirtations I have mentioned but
he broke down at last An old and very distinguished General took
Miss Youghal for a ride and began that specially offensive
youreonlyalittlegirl sort of flirtationmost difficult for
a woman to turn aside deftly and most maddening to listen to Miss
Youghal was shaking with fear at the things he said in the hearing of
her sais DullooStricklandstood it as long as he could Then he
caught hold of the Generals bridle and in most fluent English
invited him to step off and be heaved over the cliff Next minute Miss
Youghal began crying and Strickland saw that he had hopelessly given
himself away and everything was over

The General nearly had a fit while Miss Youghal was sobbing out the
story of the disguise and the engagement that wasnt recognized by the
parents Strickland was furiously angry with himself and more angry
with the General for forcing his hand so he said nothing but held
the horses head and prepared to thrash the General as some sort of
satisfaction but when the General had thoroughly grasped the story and
knew who Strickland was he began to puff and blow in the saddle and
nearly rolled off with laughing He said Strickland deserved a V C
if it were only for putting on a saiss blanket Then he called himself
names and vowed that he deserved a thrashing but he was too old to
take it from Strickland Then he complimented Miss Youghal on her lover
The scandal of the business never struck him for he was a nice old man
with a weakness for flirtations Then he laughed again and said
that old Youghal was a fool Strickland let go of the cobs head
and suggested that the General had better help them if that was his
opinion Strickland knew Youghals weakness for men with titles and
letters after their names and high official position Its rather like
a fortyminute farce said the General but begad I WILL help if
its only to escape that tremendous thrashing I deserved Go along
to your home my saisPoliceman and change into decent kit and Ill
attack Mr Youghal Miss Youghal may I ask you to canter home and wait

         

About seven minutes later there was a wild hurroosh at the Club A
sais with a blanket and headrope was asking all the men he knew For
Heavens sake lend me decent clothes As the men did not recognize him
there were some peculiar scenes before Strickland could get a hot bath
with soda in it in one room a shirt here a collar there a pair
of trousers elsewhere and so on He galloped off with half the Club
wardrobe on his back and an utter strangers pony under him to the
house of old Youghal The General arrayed in purple and fine linen was
before him What the General had said Strickland never knew but Youghal
received Strickland with moderate civility and Mrs Youghal touched
by the devotion of the transformed Dulloo was almost kind The General
beamed and chuckled and Miss Youghal came in and almost before old
Youghal knew where he was the parental consent had been wrenched out
and Strickland had departed with Miss Youghal to the Telegraph Office
to wire for his kit The final embarrassment was when an utter stranger
attacked him on the Mall and asked for the stolen pony

So in the end Strickland and Miss Youghal were married on the strict
understanding that Strickland should drop his old ways and stick to
Departmental routine which pays best and leads to Simla Strickland
was far too fond of his wife just then to break his word but it was
a sore trial to him for the streets and the bazars and the sounds in
them were full of meaning to Strickland and these called to him to
come back and take up his wanderings and his discoveries Some day I
will tell you how he broke his promise to help a friend That was long
since and he has by this time been nearly spoilt for what he would
call shikar He is forgetting the slang and the beggars cant and the
marks and the signs and the drift of the undercurrents which if a
man would master he must always continue to learn

But he fills in his Departmental returns beautifully




YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER


 I am dying for you and you are dying for another

 Punjabi Proverb


When the Gravesend tender left the P  O steamer for Bombay and went
back to catch the train to Town there were many people in it crying
But the one who wept most and most openly was Miss Agnes Laiter She
had reason to cry because the only man she ever lovedor ever could
love so she saidwas going out to India and India as every one
knows is divided equally between jungle tigers cobras cholera and
sepoys

Phil Garron leaning over the side of the steamer in the rain felt very
unhappy too but he did not cry He was sent out to tea What tea
meant he had not the vaguest idea but fancied that he would have to
ride on a prancing horse over hills covered with teavines and draw a
sumptuous salary for doing so and he was very grateful to his uncle
for getting him the berth He was really going to reform all his slack
shiftless ways save a large proportion of his magnificent salary
yearly and in a very short time return to marry Agnes Laiter Phil
Garron had been lying loose on his friends hands for three years and
as he had nothing to do he naturally fell in love He was very nice
but he was not strong in his views and opinions and principles and
though he never came to actual grief his friends were thankful when
he said goodbye and went out to this mysterious tea business near
Darjiling They saidGod bless you dear boy Let us never see your
face againor at least that was what Phil was given to understand

When he sailed he was very full of a great plan to prove himself
several hundred times better than any one had given him credit forto
work like a horse and triumphantly marry Agnes Laiter He had many good
points besides his good looks his only fault being that he was weak
the least little bit in the world weak He had as much notion of economy
as the Morning Sun and yet you could not lay your hand on any one item
and say Herein Phil Garron is extravagant or reckless Nor could
you point out any particular vice in his character but he was
unsatisfactory and as workable as putty

Agnes Laiter went about her duties at homeher family objected to the
engagementwith red eyes while Phil was sailing to Darjilinga port
on the Bengal Ocean as his mother used to tell her friends He was
popular enough on board ship made many acquaintances and a moderately
large liquor bill and sent off huge letters to Agnes Laiter at each
port Then he fell to work on this plantation somewhere between
Darjiling and Kangra and though the salary and the horse and the work
were not quite all he had fancied he succeeded fairly well and gave
himself much unnecessary credit for his perseverance

In the course of time as he settled more into collar and his work grew
fixed before him the face of Agnes Laiter went out of his mind and only
came when he was at leisure which was not often He would forget
all about her for a fortnight and remember her with a start like a
schoolboy who has forgotten to learn his lesson She did not forget
Phil because she was of the kind that never forgets Only another
mana really desirable young manpresented himself before Mrs Laiter
and the chance of a marriage with Phil was as far off as ever and
his letters were so unsatisfactory and there was a certain amount of
domestic pressure brought to bear on the girl and the young man really
was an eligible person as incomes go and the end of all things was that
Agnes married him and wrote a tempestuous whirlwind of a letter to Phil
in the wilds of Darjiling and said she should never know a happy moment
all the rest of her life Which was a true prophecy

Phil got that letter and held himself illtreated This was two years
after he had come out but by dint of thinking fixedly of Agnes Laiter
and looking at her photograph and patting himself on the back for being
one of the most constant lovers in history and warming to the work as
he went on he really fancied that he had been very hardly used He sat
down and wrote one final lettera really pathetic world without end
amen epistle explaining how he would be true to Eternity and that
all women were very much alike and he would hide his broken heart
etc etc but if at any future time etc etc he could afford to
wait etc etc unchanged affections etc etc return to her old
love etc etc for eight closelywritten pages From an artistic
point of view it was very neat work but an ordinary Philistine who
knew the state of Phils real feelingsnot the ones he rose to as he
went on writingwould have called it the thoroughly mean and selfish
work of a thoroughly mean and selfish weak man But this verdict would
have been incorrect Phil paid for the postage and felt every word he
had written for at least two days and a half It was the last flicker
before the light went out

That letter made Agnes Laiter very unhappy and she cried and put it
away in her desk and became Mrs Somebody Else for the good of her
family Which is the first duty of every Christian maid

Phil went his ways and thought no more of his letter except as an
artist thinks of a neatly touchedin sketch His ways were not bad but
they were not altogether good until they brought him across Dunmaya the
daughter of a Rajput exSubadarMajor of our Native Army The girl had a
strain of Hill blood in her and like the Hill women was not a purdah
nashin Where Phil met her or how he heard of her does not matter She
was a good girl and handsome and in her way very clever and shrewd
though of course a little hard It is to be remembered that Phil was
living very comfortably denying himself no small luxury never putting
by an anna very satisfied with himself and his good intentions was
dropping all his English correspondents one by one and beginning more
and more to look upon this land as his home Some men fall this way and
they are of no use afterwards The climate where he was stationed was
good and it really did not seem to him that there was anything to go
Home for

He did what many planters have done before himthat is to say he
made up his mind to marry a Hill girl and settle down He was seven and
twenty then with a long life before him but no spirit to go through
with it So he married Dunmaya by the forms of the English Church and
some fellowplanters said he was a fool and some said he was a
wise man Dunmaya was a thoroughly honest girl and in spite of her
reverence for an Englishman had a reasonable estimate of her husbands
weaknesses She managed him tenderly and became in less than a year a
very passable imitation of an English lady in dress and carriage It
is curious to think that a Hill man after a lifetimes education is
a Hill man still but a Hill woman can in six months master most of the
ways of her English sisters There was a coolie woman once But that is
another story Dunmaya dressed by preference in black and yellow and
looked well

Meantime the letter lay in Agness desk and now and again she would
think of poor resolute hardworking Phil among the cobras and tigers of
Darjiling toiling in the vain hope that she might come back to him Her
husband was worth ten Phils except that he had rheumatism of the
heart Three years after he was marriedand after he had tried Nice
and Algeria for his complainthe went to Bombay where he died and set
Agnes free Being a devout woman she looked on his death and the
place of it as a direct interposition of Providence and when she had
recovered from the shock she took out and reread Phils letter with the
etc etc and the big dashes and the little dashes and kissed it
several times No one knew her in Bombay she had her husbands income
which was a large one and Phil was close at hand It was wrong and
improper of course but she decided as heroines do in novels to find
her old lover to offer him her hand and her gold and with him spend
the rest of her life in some spot far from unsympathetic souls She sat
for two months alone in Watsons Hotel elaborating this decision and
the picture was a pretty one Then she set out in search of Phil Garron
Assistant on a tea plantation with a more than usually unpronounceable
name

         

She found him She spent a month over it for his plantation was not in
the Darjiling district at all but nearer Kangra Phil was very little
altered and Dunmaya was very nice to her

Now the particular sin and shame of the whole business is that Phil who
really is not worth thinking of twice was and is loved by Dunmaya
and more than loved by Agnes the whole of whose life he seems to have
spoilt

Worst of all Dunmaya is making a decent man of him and he will be
ultimately saved from perdition through her training

Which is manifestly unfair




FALSE DAWN


 Tonight God knows what thing shall tide
 The Earth is racked and faint
 Expectant sleepless openeyed
 And we who from the Earth were made
 Thrill with our Mothers pain

 In Durance


No man will ever know the exact truth of this story though women may
sometimes whisper it to one another after a dance when they are putting
up their hair for the night and comparing lists of victims A man of
course cannot assist at these functions So the tale must be told from
the outsidein the darkall wrong

Never praise a sister to a sister in the hope of your compliments
reaching the proper ears and so preparing the way for you later on
Sisters are women first and sisters afterwards and you will find that
you do yourself harm

Saumarez knew this when he made up his mind to propose to the elder Miss
Copleigh Saumarez was a strange man with few merits so far as men
could see though he was popular with women and carried enough
conceit to stock a Viceroys Council and leave a little over for the
CommanderinChiefs Staff He was a Civilian Very many women took an
interest in Saumarez perhaps because his manner to them was offensive
If you hit a pony over the nose at the outset of your acquaintance he
may not love you but he will take a deep interest in your movements
ever afterwards The elder Miss Copleigh was nice plump winning and
pretty The younger was not so pretty and from men disregarding the
hint set forth above her style was repellant and unattractive Both
girls had practically the same figure and there was a strong likeness
between them in look and voice though no one could doubt for an instant
which was the nicer of the two

Saumarez made up his mind as soon as they came into the station from
Behar to marry the elder one At least we all made sure that he
would which comes to the same thing She was two and twenty and he was
thirtythree with pay and allowances of nearly fourteen hundred rupees
a month So the match as we arranged it was in every way a good one
Saumarez was his name and summary was his nature as a man once said
Having drafted his Resolution he formed a Select Committee of One to
sit upon it and resolved to take his time In our unpleasant slang the
Copleigh girls hunted in couples That is to say you could do nothing
with one without the other They were very loving sisters but
their mutual affection was sometimes inconvenient Saumarez held the
balancehair true between them and none but himself could have said to
which side his heart inclined though every one guessed He rode
with them a good deal and danced with them but he never succeeded in
detaching them from each other for any length of time

Women said that the two girls kept together through deep mistrust each
fearing that the other would steal a march on her But that has
nothing to do with a man Saumarez was silent for good or bad and as
businesslikely attentive as he could be having due regard to his work
and his polo Beyond doubt both girls were fond of him

As the hot weather drew nearer and Saumarez made no sign women said
that you could see their trouble in the eyes of the girlsthat they
were looking strained anxious and irritable Men are quite blind in
these matters unless they have more of the woman than the man in their
composition in which case it does not matter what they say or think
I maintain it was the hot April days that took the color out of the
Copleigh girls cheeks They should have been sent to the Hills
early No oneman or womanfeels an angel when the hot weather is
approaching The younger sister grew more cynicalnot to say acidin
her ways and the winningness of the elder wore thin There was more
effort in it

Now the Station wherein all these things happened was though not
a little one off the line of rail and suffered through want of
attention There were no gardens or bands or amusements worth speaking
of and it was nearly a days journey to come into Lahore for a dance
People were grateful for small things to interest them

About the beginning of May and just before the final exodus of
Hillgoers when the weather was very hot and there were not more than
twenty people in the Station Saumarez gave a moonlight ridingpicnic at
an old tomb six miles away near the bed of the river It was a Noahs
Ark picnic and there was to be the usual arrangement of quartermile
intervals between each couple on account of the dust Six couples came
altogether including chaperons Moonlight picnics are useful just at
the very end of the season before all the girls go away to the Hills
They lead to understandings and should be encouraged by chaperones
especially those whose girls look sweetish in riding habits I knew a
case once But that is another story That picnic was called the Great
Pop Picnic because every one knew Saumarez would propose then to the
eldest Miss Copleigh and beside his affair there was another which
might possibly come to happiness The social atmosphere was heavily
charged and wanted clearing

We met at the paradeground at ten the night was fearfully hot The
horses sweated even at walkingpace but anything was better than
sitting still in our own dark houses When we moved off under the full
moon we were four couples one triplet and Mr Saumarez rode with the
Copleigh girls and I loitered at the tail of the procession wondering
with whom Saumarez would ride home Every one was happy and contented
but we all felt that things were going to happen We rode slowly and
it was nearly midnight before we reached the old tomb facing the ruined
tank in the decayed gardens where we were going to eat and drink I
was late in coming up and before I went into the garden I saw that the
horizon to the north carried a faint duncolored feather But no one
would have thanked me for spoiling so wellmanaged an entertainment as
this picnicand a duststorm more or less does no great harm

We gathered by the tank Some one had brought out a banjowhich is a
most sentimental instrumentand three or four of us sang You must not
laugh at this Our amusements in outoftheway Stations are very few
indeed Then we talked in groups or together lying under the trees
with the sunbaked roses dropping their petals on our feet until supper
was ready It was a beautiful supper as cold and as iced as you could
wish and we stayed long over it

I had felt that the air was growing hotter and hotter but nobody
seemed to notice it until the moon went out and a burning hot wind began
lashing the orangetrees with a sound like the noise of the sea Before
we knew where we were the duststorm was on us and everything was
roaring whirling darkness The suppertable was blown bodily into the
tank We were afraid of staying anywhere near the old tomb for fear it
might be blown down So we felt our way to the orangetrees where the
horses were picketed and waited for the storm to blow over Then the
little light that was left vanished and you could not see your hand
before your face The air was heavy with dust and sand from the bed
of the river that filled boots and pockets and drifted down necks and
coated eyebrows and moustaches It was one of the worst duststorms of
the year We were all huddled together close to the trembling horses
with the thunder clattering overhead and the lightning spurting like
water from a sluice all ways at once There was no danger of course
unless the horses broke loose I was standing with my head downward and
my hands over my mouth hearing the trees thrashing each other I could
not see who was next me till the flashes came Then I found that I was
packed near Saumarez and the eldest Miss Copleigh with my own horse
just in front of me I recognized the eldest Miss Copleigh because
she had a pagri round her helmet and the younger had not All the
electricity in the air had gone into my body and I was quivering and
tingling from head to footexactly as a corn shoots and tingles before
rain It was a grand storm The wind seemed to be picking up the earth
and pitching it to leeward in great heaps and the heat beat up from the
ground like the heat of the Day of Judgment

The storm lulled slightly after the first halfhour and I heard a
despairing little voice close to my ear saying to itself quietly and
softly as if some lost soul were flying about with the wind O my
God Then the younger Miss Copleigh stumbled into my arms saying
Where is my horse Get my horse I want to go home I WANT to go home
Take me home

I thought that the lightning and the black darkness had frightened her
so I said there was no danger but she must wait till the storm blew
over She answered It is not THAT It is not THAT I want to go home
O take me away from here

I said that she could not go till the light came but I felt her brush
past me and go away It was too dark to see where Then the whole sky
was split open with one tremendous flash as if the end of the world
were coming and all the women shrieked

Almost directly after this I felt a mans hand on my shoulder and heard
Saumarez bellowing in my ear Through the rattling of the trees and
howling of the wind I did not catch his words at once but at last
I heard him say Ive proposed to the wrong one What shall I do
Saumarez had no occasion to make this confidence to me I was never a
friend of his nor am I now but I fancy neither of us were ourselves
just then He was shaking as he stood with excitement and I was feeling
queer all over with the electricity I could not think of anything to
say exceptMore fool you for proposing in a duststorm But I did
not see how that would improve the mistake

Then he shouted Wheres EdithEdith Copleigh Edith was the youngest
sister I answered out of my astonishmentWhat do you want with HER
Would you believe it for the next two minutes he and I were shouting
at each other like maniacshe vowing that it was the youngest sister he
had meant to propose to all along and I telling him till my throat
was hoarse that he must have made a mistake I cant account for
this except again by the fact that we were neither of us ourselves
Everything seemed to me like a bad dreamfrom the stamping of the
horses in the darkness to Saumarez telling me the story of his loving
Edith Copleigh since the first He was still clawing my shoulder and
begging me to tell him where Edith Copleigh was when another lull came
and brought light with it and we saw the dustcloud forming on the
plain in front of us So we knew the worst was over The moon was low
down and there was just the glimmer of the false dawn that comes about
an hour before the real one But the light was very faint and the dun
cloud roared like a bull I wondered where Edith Copleigh had gone and
as I was wondering I saw three things together First Maud Copleighs
face come smiling out of the darkness and move towards Saumarez who was
standing by me I heard the girl whisper George and slide her arm
through the arm that was not clawing my shoulder and I saw that look
on her face which only comes once or twice in a lifetimewhen a woman
is perfectly happy and the air is full of trumpets and gorgeouscolored
fire and the Earth turns into cloud because she loves and is loved At
the same time I saw Saumarezs face as he heard Maud Copleighs voice
and fifty yards away from the clump of orangetrees I saw a brown
holland habit getting upon a horse

It must have been my state of overexcitement that made me so quick
to meddle with what did not concern me Saumarez was moving off to the
habit but I pushed him back and saidStop here and explain Ill
fetch her back and I ran out to get at my own horse I had a perfectly
unnecessary notion that everything must be done decently and in order
and that Saumarezs first care was to wipe the happy look out of Maud
Copleighs face All the time I was linking up the curbchain I wondered
how he would do it

I cantered after Edith Copleigh thinking to bring her back slowly on
some pretence or another But she galloped away as soon as she saw me
and I was forced to ride after her in earnest She called back over her
shoulderGo away Im going home Oh go away two or three times
but my business was to catch her first and argue later The ride just
fitted in with the rest of the evil dream The ground was very bad and
now and again we rushed through the whirling choking dustdevils in
the skirts of the flying storm There was a burning hot wind blowing
that brought up a stench of stale brickkilns with it and through the
half light and through the dustdevils across that desolate plain
flickered the brown holland habit on the gray horse She headed for
the Station at first Then she wheeled round and set off for the river
through beds of burnt down junglegrass bad even to ride a pig over In
cold blood I should never have dreamed of going over such a country
at night but it seemed quite right and natural with the lightning
crackling overhead and a reek like the smell of the Pit in my nostrils
I rode and shouted and she bent forward and lashed her horse and the
aftermath of the duststorm came up and caught us both and drove us
downwind like pieces of paper

I dont know how far we rode but the drumming of the horsehoofs and
the roar of the wind and the race of the faint bloodred moon through
the yellow mist seemed to have gone on for years and years and I was
literally drenched with sweat from my helmet to my gaiters when the gray
stumbled recovered himself and pulled up dead lame My brute was used
up altogether Edith Copleigh was in a sad state plastered with dust
her helmet off and crying bitterly Why cant you let me alone she
said I only wanted to get away and go home Oh PLEASE let me go

You have got to come back with me Miss Copleigh Saumarez has
something to say to you

It was a foolish way of putting it but I hardly knew Miss Copleigh
and though I was playing Providence at the cost of my horse I could
not tell her in as many words what Saumarez had told me I thought he
could do that better himself All her pretence about being tired and
wanting to go home broke down and she rocked herself to and fro in the
saddle as she sobbed and the hot wind blew her black hair to leeward I
am not going to repeat what she said because she was utterly unstrung

This if you please was the cynical Miss Copleigh Here was I almost
an utter stranger to her trying to tell her that Saumarez loved her
and she was to come back to hear him say so I believe I made myself
understood for she gathered the gray together and made him hobble
somehow and we set off for the tomb while the storm went thundering
down to Umballa and a few big drops of warm rain fell I found out that
she had been standing close to Saumarez when he proposed to her sister
and had wanted to go home and cry in peace as an English girl should
She dabbled her eyes with her pockethandkerchief as we went along and
babbled to me out of sheer lightness of heart and hysteria That was
perfectly unnatural and yet it seemed all right at the time and in the
place All the world was only the two Copleigh girls Saumarez and I
ringed in with the lightning and the dark and the guidance of this
misguided world seemed to lie in my hands

When we returned to the tomb in the deep dead stillness that followed
the storm the dawn was just breaking and nobody had gone away They
were waiting for our return Saumarez most of all His face was white
and drawn As Miss Copleigh and I limped up he came forward to meet us
and when he helped her down from her saddle he kissed her before
all the picnic It was like a scene in a theatre and the likeness was
heightened by all the dustwhite ghostlylooking men and women under
the orangetrees clapping their hands as if they were watching a
playat Saumarezs choice I never knew anything so unEnglish in my
life

Lastly Saumarez said we must all go home or the Station would come
out to look for us and WOULD I be good enough to ride home with Maud
Copleigh Nothing would give me greater pleasure I said

So we formed up six couples in all and went back two by two Saumarez
walking at the side of Edith Copleigh who was riding his horse

The air was cleared and little by little as the sun rose I felt we
were all dropping back again into ordinary men and women and that
the Great Pop Picnic was a thing altogether apart and out of the
worldnever to happen again It had gone with the duststorm and the
tingle in the hot air

I felt tired and limp and a good deal ashamed of myself as I went in
for a bath and some sleep

There is a womans version of this story but it will never be
written unless Maud Copleigh cares to try




THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES


 Thus for a season they fought it fair
 She and his cousin May
 Tactful talented debonnaire
 Decorous foes were they
 But never can battle of man compare
 With merciless feminine fray

 Two and One


Mrs Hauksbee was sometimes nice to her own sex Here is a story to
prove this and you can believe just as much as ever you please

Pluffles was a subaltern in the Unmentionables He was callow even
for a subaltern He was callow all overlike a canary that had not
finished fledging itself The worst of it was he had three times as much
money as was good for him Pluffles Papa being a rich man and Pluffles
being the only son Pluffles Mamma adored him She was only a little
less callow than Pluffles and she believed everything he said

Pluffles weakness was not believing what people said He preferred what
he called trusting to his own judgment He had as much judgment as he
had seat or hands and this preference tumbled him into trouble once or
twice But the biggest trouble Pluffles ever manufactured came about at
Simlasome years ago when he was fourandtwenty

He began by trusting to his own judgment as usual and the result
was that after a time he was bound hand and foot to Mrs Reivers
rickshaw wheels

There was nothing good about Mrs Reiver unless it was her dress
She was bad from her hairwhich started life on a Brittanys girls
headto her bootheels which were two and threeeighth inches high
She was not honestly mischievous like Mrs Hauksbee she was wicked in a
businesslike way

There was never any scandalshe had not generous impulses enough for
that She was the exception which proved the rule that AngloIndian
ladies are in every way as nice as their sisters at Home She spent her
life in proving that rule

Mrs Hauksbee and she hated each other fervently They heard far
too much to clash but the things they said of each other were
startlingnot to say original Mrs Hauksbee was honesthonest as her
own front teethand but for her love of mischief would have been
a womans woman There was no honesty about Mrs Reiver nothing but
selfishness And at the beginning of the season poor little Pluffles
fell a prey to her She laid herself out to that end and who was
Pluffles to resist He went on trusting to his judgment and he got
judged

I have seen Hayes argue with a tough horseI have seen a tongadriver
coerce a stubborn ponyI have seen a riotous setter broken to gun by a
hard keeperbut the breakingin of Pluffles of the Unmentionables was
beyond all these He learned to fetch and carry like a dog and to
wait like one too for a word from Mrs Reiver He learned to keep
appointments which Mrs Reiver had no intention of keeping He learned
to take thankfully dances which Mrs Reiver had no intention of giving
him He learned to shiver for an hour and a quarter on the windward side
of Elysium while Mrs Reiver was making up her mind to come for a
ride He learned to hunt for a rickshaw in a light dresssuit under
a pelting rain and to walk by the side of that rickshaw when he had
found it He learned what it was to be spoken to like a coolie and
ordered about like a cook He learned all this and many other things
besides And he paid for his schooling

Perhaps in some hazy way he fancied that it was fine and impressive
that it gave him a status among men and was altogether the thing to do
It was nobodys business to warn Pluffles that he was unwise The pace
that season was too good to inquire and meddling with another mans
folly is always thankless work Pluffles Colonel should have ordered
him back to his regiment when he heard how things were going But
Pluffles had got himself engaged to a girl in England the last time
he went home and if there was one thing more than another which the
Colonel detested it was a married subaltern He chuckled when he heard
of the education of Pluffles and said it was good training for
the boy But it was not good training in the least It led him into
spending money beyond his means which were good above that the
education spoilt an average boy and made it a tenthrate man of an
objectionable kind He wandered into a bad set and his little bill at
Hamiltons was a thing to wonder at

Then Mrs Hauksbee rose to the occasion She played her game alone
knowing what people would say of her and she played it for the sake of
a girl she had never seen Pluffles fiancee was to come out under the
chaperonage of an aunt in October to be married to Pluffles

At the beginning of August Mrs Hauksbee discovered that it was time to
interfere A man who rides much knows exactly what a horse is going to
do next before he does it In the same way a woman of Mrs Hauksbees
experience knows accurately how a boy will behave under certain
circumstancesnotably when he is infatuated with one of Mrs Reivers
stamp She said that sooner or later little Pluffles would break off
that engagement for nothing at allsimply to gratify Mrs Reiver who
in return would keep him at her feet and in her service just so long
as she found it worth her while She said she knew the signs of these
things If she did not no one else could

Then she went forth to capture Pluffles under the guns of the enemy
just as Mrs CusackBremmil carried away Bremmil under Mrs Hauksbees
eyes

This particular engagement lasted seven weekswe called it the Seven
Weeks Warand was fought out inch by inch on both sides A detailed
account would fill a book and would be incomplete then Any one who
knows about these things can fit in the details for himself It was
a superb fightthere will never be another like it as long as Jakko
standsand Pluffles was the prize of victory People said shameful
things about Mrs Hauksbee They did not know what she was playing
for Mrs Reiver fought partly because Pluffles was useful to her but
mainly because she hated Mrs Hauksbee and the matter was a trial of
strength between them No one knows what Pluffles thought He had not
many ideas at the best of times and the few he possessed made him
conceited Mrs Hauksbee saidThe boy must be caught and the only
way of catching him is by treating him well

So she treated him as a man of the world and of experience so long as
the issue was doubtful Little by little Pluffles fell away from his
old allegiance and came over to the enemy by whom he was made much of
He was never sent on outpost duty after rickshaws any more nor was
he given dances which never came off nor were the drains on his
purse continued Mrs Hauksbee held him on the snaffle and after his
treatment at Mrs Reivers hands he appreciated the change

Mrs Reiver had broken him of talking about himself and made him
talk about her own merits Mrs Hauksbee acted otherwise and won
his confidence till he mentioned his engagement to the girl at Home
speaking of it in a high and mighty way as a piece of boyish folly
This was when he was taking tea with her one afternoon and discoursing
in what he considered a gay and fascinating style Mrs Hauksbee had
seen an earlier generation of his stamp bud and blossom and decay into
fat Captains and tubby Majors

At a moderate estimate there were about three and twenty sides to that
ladys character Some men say more She began to talk to Pluffles after
the manner of a mother and as if there had been three hundred years
instead of fifteen between them She spoke with a sort of throaty
quaver in her voice which had a soothing effect though what she said
was anything but soothing She pointed out the exceeding folly not to
say meanness of Pluffles conduct and the smallness of his views Then
he stammered something about trusting to his own judgment as a man of
the world and this paved the way for what she wanted to say next It
would have withered up Pluffles had it come from any other woman but
in the soft cooing style in which Mrs Hauksbee put it it only made
him feel limp and repentantas if he had been in some superior kind of
church Little by little very softly and pleasantly she began taking
the conceit out of Pluffles as you take the ribs out of an umbrella
before recovering it She told him what she thought of him and his
judgment and his knowledge of the world and how his performances had
made him ridiculous to other people and how it was his intention to make
love to herself if she gave him the chance Then she said that marriage
would be the making of him and drew a pretty little pictureall rose
and opalof the Mrs Pluffles of the future going through life relying
on the judgment and knowledge of the world of a husband who
had nothing to reproach himself with How she reconciled these
two statements she alone knew But they did not strike Pluffles as
conflicting

Hers was a perfect little homilymuch better than any clergyman could
have givenand it ended with touching allusions to Pluffles Mamma and
Papa and the wisdom of taking his bride Home

Then she sent Pluffles out for a walk to think over what she had said
Pluffles left blowing his nose very hard and holding himself very
straight Mrs Hauksbee laughed

What Pluffles had intended to do in the matter of the engagement only
Mrs Reiver knew and she kept her own counsel to her death She would
have liked it spoiled as a compliment I fancy

Pluffles enjoyed many talks with Mrs Hauksbee during the next few days
They were all to the same end and they helped Pluffles in the path of
Virtue

Mrs Hauksbee wanted to keep him under her wing to the last Therefore
she discountenanced his going down to Bombay to get married Goodness
only knows what might happen by the way she said Pluffles is cursed
with the curse of Reuben and India is no fit place for him

In the end the fiancee arrived with her aunt and Pluffles having
reduced his affairs to some sort of orderhere again Mrs Hauksbee
helped himwas married

Mrs Hauksbee gave a sigh of relief when both the I wills had been
said and went her way

Pluffies took her advice about going Home He left the Service and is
now raising speckled cattle inside green painted fences somewhere at
Home I believe he does this very judiciously He would have come to
extreme grief out here

For these reasons if any one says anything more than usually nasty about
Mrs Hauksbee tell him the story of the Rescue of Pluffles




CUPIDS ARROWS


 Pit where the buffalo cooled his hide
 By the hot sun emptied and blistered and dried
 Log in the rehgrass hidden and alone
 Bund where the earthrats mounds are strown
 Cave in the bank where the sly stream steals
 Aloe that stabs at the belly and heels
 Jump if you dare on a steed untried
 Safer it is to go widego wide
 Hark from in front where the best men ride
 Pull to the off boys Wide Go wide

 The Peora Hunt



Once upon a time there lived at Simla a very pretty girl the daughter
of a poor but honest District and Sessions Judge She was a good girl
but could not help knowing her power and using it Her Mamma was very
anxious about her daughters future as all good Mammas should be

When a man is a Commissioner and a bachelor and has the right of wearing
openwork jamtart jewels in gold and enamel on his clothes and of
going through a door before every one except a Member of Council a
LieutenantGovernor or a Viceroy he is worth marrying At least that
is what ladies say There was a Commissioner in Simla in those days
who was and wore and did all I have said He was a plain manan ugly
manthe ugliest man in Asia with two exceptions His was a face to
dream about and try to carve on a pipehead afterwards His name was
SaggottBarrSaggottAnthony BarrSaggott and six letters to follow
Departmentally he was one of the best men the Government of India
owned Socially he was like a blandishing gorilla

When he turned his attentions to Miss Beighton I believe that Mrs
Beighton wept with delight at the reward Providence had sent her in her
old age

Mr Beighton held his tongue He was an easygoing man

Now a Commissioner is very rich His pay is beyond the dreams of
avariceis so enormous that he can afford to save and scrape in a way
that would almost discredit a Member of Council Most Commissioners
are mean but BarrSaggott was an exception He entertained royally he
horsed himself well he gave dances he was a power in the land and he
behaved as such

Consider that everything I am writing of took place in an almost
prehistoric era in the history of British India Some folk may remember
the years before lawntennis was born when we all played croquet There
were seasons before that if you will believe me when even croquet
had not been invented and archerywhich was revived in England in
1844was as great a pest as lawntennis is now People talked learnedly
about holding and loosing steles reflexed bows 56pound
bows backed or selfyew bows as we talk about rallies
volleys smashes returns and 16ounce rackets

Miss Beighton shot divinely over ladies distance60 yards that
isand was acknowledged the best lady archer in Simla Men called her
Diana of TaraDevi

BarrSaggott paid her great attention and as I have said the heart of
her mother was uplifted in consequence Kitty Beighton took matters more
calmly It was pleasant to be singled out by a Commissioner with letters
after his name and to fill the hearts of other girls with bad feelings
But there was no denying the fact that BarrSaggott was phenomenally
ugly and all his attempts to adorn himself only made him more
grotesque He was not christened The Langurwhich means gray apefor
nothing It was pleasant Kitty thought to have him at her feet but
it was better to escape from him and ride with the graceless Cubbonthe
man in a Dragoon Regiment at Umballathe boy with a handsome face and
no prospects Kitty liked Cubbon more than a little He never pretended
for a moment the he was anything less than head over heels in love with
her for he was an honest boy So Kitty fled now and again from the
stately wooings of BarrSaggott to the company of young Cubbon and
was scolded by her Mamma in consequence But Mother she said Mr
Saggot is suchsuch ais so FEARFULLY ugly you know

My dear said Mrs Beighton piously we cannot be other than an
allruling Providence has made us Besides you will take precedence of
your own Mother you know Think of that and be reasonable

Then Kitty put up her little chin and said irreverent things about
precedence and Commissioners and matrimony Mr Beighton rubbed the
top of his head for he was an easygoing man

Late in the season when he judged that the time was ripe BarrSaggott
developed a plan which did great credit to his administrative powers
He arranged an archery tournament for ladies with a most sumptuous
diamondstudded bracelet as prize He drew up his terms skilfully
and every one saw that the bracelet was a gift to Miss Beighton the
acceptance carrying with it the hand and the heart of Commissioner
BarrSaggott The terms were a St Leonards Roundthirtysix shots at
sixty yardsunder the rules of the Simla Toxophilite Society

All Simla was invited There were beautifully arranged teatables under
the deodars at Annandale where the Grand Stand is now and alone in
its glory winking in the sun sat the diamond bracelet in a blue velvet
case Miss Beighton was anxiousalmost too anxious to compete On the
appointed afternoon all Simla rode down to Annandale to witness the
Judgment of Paris turned upside down Kitty rode with young Cubbon and
it was easy to see that the boy was troubled in his mind He must be
held innocent of everything that followed Kitty was pale and nervous
and looked long at the bracelet BarrSaggott was gorgeously dressed
even more nervous than Kitty and more hideous than ever

Mrs Beighton smiled condescendingly as befitted the mother of a
potential Commissioneress and the shooting began all the world
standing in a semicircle as the ladies came out one after the other

Nothing is so tedious as an archery competition They shot and they
shot and they kept on shooting till the sun left the valley and
little breezes got up in the deodars and people waited for Miss
Beighton to shoot and win Cubbon was at one horn of the semicircle
round the shooters and BarrSaggott at the other Miss Beighton was
last on the list The scoring had been weak and the bracelet PLUS
Commissioner BarrSaggott was hers to a certainty

The Commissioner strung her bow with his own sacred hands She stepped
forward looked at the bracelet and her first arrow went true to a
hairfull into the heart of the goldcounting nine points

Young Cubbon on the left turned white and his Devil prompted
BarrSaggott to smile Now horses used to shy when BarrSaggott smiled
Kitty saw that smile She looked to her leftfront gave an almost
imperceptible nod to Cubbon and went on shooting

I wish I could describe the scene that followed It was out of the
ordinary and most improper Miss Kitty fitted her arrows with immense
deliberation so that every one might see what she was doing She was
a perfect shot and her 46pound bow suited her to a nicety She pinned
the wooden legs of the target with great care four successive times She
pinned the wooden top of the target once and all the ladies looked at
each other Then she began some fancy shooting at the white which
if you hit it counts exactly one point She put five arrows into the
white It was wonderful archery but seeing that her business was to
make golds and win the bracelet BarrSaggott turned a delicate green
like young watergrass Next she shot over the target twice then wide
to the left twicealways with the same deliberationwhile a chilly
hush fell over the company and Mrs Beighton took out her handkerchief
Then Kitty shot at the ground in front of the target and split several
arrows Then she made a redor seven pointsjust to show what she
could do if she liked and finished up her amazing performance with some
more fancy shooting at the targetsupports Here is her score as it was
picked off

 Gold Red Blue Black White Total Hits Total
 Score
 Miss Beighton 1 1 0 0 5 7 21


BarrSaggott looked as if the last few arrowheads had been driven into
his legs instead of the targets and the deep stillness was broken by
a little snubby mottled halfgrown girl saying in a shrill voice of
triumph Then IVE won

Mrs Beighton did her best to bear up but she wept in the presence of
the people No training could help her through such a disappointment
Kitty unstrung her bow with a vicious jerk and went back to her place
while BarrSaggott was trying to pretend that he enjoyed snapping
the bracelet on the snubby girls raw red wrist It was an awkward
scenemost awkward Every one tried to depart in a body and leave Kitty
to the mercy of her Mamma

But Cubbon took her away instead andthe rest isnt worth printing




HIS CHANCE IN LIFE


 Then a pile of heads be laid
 Thirty thousand heaped on high
 All to please the Kafir maid
 Where the Oxus ripples by
 Grimly spake Atulla Khan
 Love hath made this thing a Man

 Oattas Story


If you go straight away from Levees and Government House Lists past
Trades Ballsfar beyond everything and everybody you ever knew in your
respectable lifeyou cross in time the Border line where the last
drop of White blood ends and the full tide of Black sets in It would be
easier to talk to a new made Duchess on the spur of the moment than
to the Borderline folk without violating some of their conventions or
hurting their feelings The Black and the White mix very quaintly in
their ways Sometimes the White shows in spurts of fierce childish
pridewhich is Pride of Race run crookedand sometimes the Black
in still fiercer abasement and humility half heathenish customs and
strange unaccountable impulses to crime One of these days this
peopleunderstand they are far lower than the class whence Derozio the
man who imitated Byron sprungwill turn out a writer or a poet and
then we shall know how they live and what they feel In the meantime
any stories about them cannot be absolutely correct in fact or
inference

Miss Vezzis came from across the Borderline to look after some children
who belonged to a lady until a regularly ordained nurse could come out
The lady said Miss Vezzis was a bad dirty nurse and inattentive It
never struck her that Miss Vezzis had her own life to lead and her own
affairs to worry over and that these affairs were the most important
things in the world to Miss Vezzis Very few mistresses admit this sort
of reasoning Miss Vezzis was as black as a boot and to our standard of
taste hideously ugly She wore cottonprint gowns and bulged shoes
and when she lost her temper with the children she abused them in the
language of the Borderlinewhich is part English part Portuguese
and part Native She was not attractive but she had her pride and she
preferred being called Miss Vezzis

Every Sunday she dressed herself wonderfully and went to see her
Mamma who lived for the most part on an old cane chair in a greasy
tussursilk dressinggown and a big rabbitwarren of a house full of
Vezzises Pereiras Ribieras Lisboas and Gansalveses and a floating
population of loafers besides fragments of the days bazar garlic
stale incense clothes thrown on the floor petticoats hung on strings
for screens old bottles pewter crucifixes dried immortelles pariah
puppies plaster images of the Virgin and hats without crowns Miss
Vezzis drew twenty rupees a month for acting as nurse and she
squabbled weekly with her Mamma as to the percentage to be given towards
housekeeping When the quarrel was over Michele DCruze used to shamble
across the low mud wall of the compound and make love to Miss Vezzis
after the fashion of the Borderline which is hedged about with much
ceremony Michele was a poor sickly weed and very black but he had his
pride He would not be seen smoking a huqa for anything and he looked
down on natives as only a man with seveneighths native blood in his
veins can The Vezzis Family had their pride too They traced their
descent from a mythical platelayer who had worked on the Sone Bridge
when railways were new in India and they valued their English origin
Michele was a Telegraph Signaller on Rs 35 a month The fact that he
was in Government employ made Mrs Vezzis lenient to the shortcomings of
his ancestors

There was a compromising legendDom Anna the tailor brought it from
Poonanithat a black Jew of Cochin had once married into the DCruze
family while it was an open secret that an uncle of Mrs DCruze was at
that very time doing menial work connected with cooking for a Club in
Southern India He sent Mrs DCruze seven rupees eight annas a month
but she felt the disgrace to the family very keenly all the same

However in the course of a few Sundays Mrs Vezzis brought herself
to overlook these blemishes and gave her consent to the marriage of her
daughter with Michele on condition that Michele should have at least
fifty rupees a month to start married life upon This wonderful prudence
must have been a lingering touch of the mythical platelayers Yorkshire
blood for across the Borderline people take a pride in marrying when
they pleasenot when they can

Having regard to his departmental prospects Miss Vezzis might as well
have asked Michele to go away and come back with the Moon in his pocket
But Michele was deeply in love with Miss Vezzis and that helped him to
endure He accompanied Miss Vezzis to Mass one Sunday and after Mass
walking home through the hot stale dust with her hand in his he swore
by several Saints whose names would not interest you never to forget
Miss Vezzis and she swore by her Honor and the Saintsthe oath runs
rather curiously In nomine Sanctissimae whatever the name of the
sheSaint is and so forth ending with a kiss on the forehead a kiss
on the left cheek and a kiss on the mouthnever to forget Michele

Next week Michele was transferred and Miss Vezzis dropped tears
upon the windowsash of the Intermediate compartment as he left the
Station

If you look at the telegraphmap of India you will see a long line
skirting the coast from Backergunge to Madras Michele was ordered to
Tibasu a little Suboffice onethird down this line to send messages
on from Berhampur to Chicacola and to think of Miss Vezzis and his
chances of getting fifty rupees a month out of office hours He had the
noise of the Bay of Bengal and a Bengali Babu for company nothing more
He sent foolish letters with crosses tucked inside the flaps of the
envelopes to Miss Vezzis

When he had been at Tibasu for nearly three weeks his chance came

Never forget that unless the outward and visible signs of Our
Authority are always before a native he is as incapable as a child of
understanding what authority means or where is the danger of disobeying
it Tibasu was a forgotten little place with a few Orissa Mohamedans
in it These hearing nothing of the CollectorSahib for some time
and heartily despising the Hindu SubJudge arranged to start a little
Mohurrum riot of their own But the Hindus turned out and broke their
heads when finding lawlessness pleasant Hindus and Mahomedans
together raised an aimless sort of Donnybrook just to see how far they
could go They looted each others shops and paid off private grudges
in the regular way It was a nasty little riot but not worth putting in
the newspapers

Michele was working in his office when he heard the sound that a man
never forgets all his lifethe ahyah of an angry crowd When that
sound drops about three tones and changes to a thick droning _ut_ the
man who hears it had better go away if he is alone The Native Police
Inspector ran in and told Michele that the town was in an uproar and
coming to wreck the Telegraph Office The Babu put on his cap and
quietly dropped out of the window while the Police Inspector afraid
but obeying the old raceinstinct which recognizes a drop of White blood
as far as it can be diluted saidWhat orders does the Sahib give

The Sahib decided Michele Though horribly frightened he felt that
for the hour he the man with the Cochin Jew and the menial uncle in
his pedigree was the only representative of English authority in the
place Then he thought of Miss Vezzis and the fifty rupees and took the
situation on himself There were seven native policemen in Tibasu and
four crazy smoothbore muskets among them All the men were gray with
fear but not beyond leading Michele dropped the key of the telegraph
instrument and went out at the head of his army to meet the mob As
the shouting crew came round a corner of the road he dropped and fired
the men behind him loosing instinctively at the same time

The whole crowdcurs to the backboneyelled and ran leaving one man
dead and another dying in the road Michele was sweating with fear but
he kept his weakness under and went down into the town past the house
where the SubJudge had barricaded himself The streets were empty
Tibasu was more frightened than Michele for the mob had been taken at
the right time

Michele returned to the TelegraphOffice and sent a message to
Chicacola asking for help Before an answer came he received a
deputation of the elders of Tibasu telling him that the SubJudge said
his actions generally were unconstitutional and trying to bully him
But the heart of Michele DCruze was big and white in his breast
because of his love for Miss Vezzis the nursegirl and because he had
tasted for the first time Responsibility and Success Those two make
an intoxicating drink and have ruined more men than ever has Whiskey
Michele answered that the SubJudge might say what he pleased but
until the Assistant Collector came the Telegraph Signaller was the
Government of India in Tibasu and the elders of the town would be held
accountable for further rioting Then they bowed their heads and said
Show mercy or words to that effect and went back in great fear each
accusing the other of having begun the rioting

Early in the dawn after a nights patrol with his seven policemen
Michele went down the road musket in hand to meet the Assistant
Collector who had ridden in to quell Tibasu But in the presence of
this young Englishman Michele felt himself slipping back more and more
into the native and the tale of the Tibasu Riots ended with the strain
on the teller in an hysterical outburst of tears bred by sorrow that
he had killed a man shame that he could not feel as uplifted as he had
felt through the night and childish anger that his tongue could not
do justice to his great deeds It was the White drop in Micheles veins
dying out though he did not know it

But the Englishman understood and after he had schooled those men
of Tibasu and had conferred with the SubJudge till that excellent
official turned green he found time to draught an official letter
describing the conduct of Michele Which letter filtered through the
Proper Channels and ended in the transfer of Michele upcountry once
more on the Imperial salary of sixtysix rupees a month

So he and Miss Vezzis were married with great state and ancientry and
now there are several little DCruzes sprawling about the verandahs of
the Central Telegraph Office

But if the whole revenue of the Department he serves were to be his
reward Michele could never never repeat what he did at Tibasu for the
sake of Miss Vezzis the nursegirl

Which proves that when a man does good work out of all proportion to
his pay in seven cases out of nine there is a woman at the back of the
virtue

The two exceptions must have suffered from sunstroke




WATCHES OF THE NIGHT


 What is in the Brahmins books that is in the Brahmins heart
 Neither you nor I knew there was so much evil in the world

 Hindu Proverb


This began in a practical joke but it has gone far enough now and is
getting serious

Platte the Subaltern being poor had a Waterbury watch and a plain
leather guard

The Colonel had a Waterbury watch also and for guard the lipstrap of
a curbchain Lipstraps make the best watch guards They are strong
and short Between a lipstrap and an ordinary leather guard there is no
great difference between one Waterbury watch and another there is none
at all Every one in the station knew the Colonels lipstrap He was
not a horsey man but he liked people to believe he had been on once
and he wove fantastic stories of the huntingbridle to which this
particular lipstrap had belonged Otherwise he was painfully religious

Platte and the Colonel were dressing at the Clubboth late for their
engagements and both in a hurry That was Kismet The two watches
were on a shelf below the lookingglassguards hanging down That was
carelessness Platte changed first snatched a watch looked in the
glass settled his tie and ran Forty seconds later the Colonel did
exactly the same thing each man taking the others watch

You may have noticed that many religious people are deeply suspicious
They seemfor purely religious purposes of courseto know more about
iniquity than the Unregenerate Perhaps they were specially bad before
they became converted At any rate in the imputation of things evil
and in putting the worst construction on things innocent a certain type
of good people may be trusted to surpass all others The Colonel and
his Wife were of that type But the Colonels Wife was the worst She
manufactured the Station scandal andTALKED TO HER AYAH Nothing
more need be said The Colonels Wife broke up the Laplaces home The
Colonels Wife stopped the FerrisHaughtrey engagement The Colonels
Wife induced young Buxton to keep his wife down in the Plains through
the first year of the marriage Whereby little Mrs Buxton died and
the baby with her These things will be remembered against the Colonels
Wife so long as there is a regiment in the country

But to come back to the Colonel and Platte They went their several
ways from the dressingroom The Colonel dined with two Chaplains while
Platte went to a bachelorparty and whist to follow

Mark how things happen If Plattes sais had put the new saddlepad on
the mare the butts of the territs would not have worked through the
worn leather and the old pad into the mares withers when she was
coming home at two oclock in the morning She would not have reared
bolted fallen into a ditch upset the cart and sent Platte flying over
an aloehedge on to Mrs Larkyns wellkept lawn and this tale would
never have been written But the mare did all these things and while
Platte was rolling over and over on the turf like a shot rabbit the
watch and guard flew from his waistcoatas an Infantry Majors sword
hops out of the scabbard when they are firing a feu de joieand rolled
and rolled in the moonlight till it stopped under a window

Platte stuffed his handkerchief under the pad put the cart straight
and went home

Mark again how Kismet works This would not happen once in a hundred
years Towards the end of his dinner with the two Chaplains the Colonel
let out his waistcoat and leaned over the table to look at some Mission
Reports The bar of the watchguard worked through the buttonhole and
the watchPlattes watchslid quietly on to the carpet Where the
bearer found it next morning and kept it

Then the Colonel went home to the wife of his bosom but the driver of
the carriage was drunk and lost his way So the Colonel returned at an
unseemly hour and his excuses were not accepted If the Colonels Wife
had been an ordinary vessel of wrath appointed for destruction she
would have known that when a man stays away on purpose his excuse
is always sound and original The very baldness of the Colonels
explanation proved its truth

See once more the workings of Kismet The Colonels watch which came
with Platte hurriedly on to Mrs Larkyns lawn chose to stop just under
Mrs Larkyns window where she saw it early in the morning recognized
it and picked it up She had heard the crash of Plattes cart at two
oclock that morning and his voice calling the mare names She knew
Platte and liked him That day she showed him the watch and heard his
story He put his head on one side winked and saidHow disgusting
Shocking old man with his religious training too I should send the
watch to the Colonels Wife and ask for explanations

Mrs Larkyn thought for a minute of the Laplaceswhom she had known
when Laplace and his wife believed in each otherand answeredI will
send it I think it will do her good But remember we must NEVER tell
her the truth

Platte guessed that his own watch was in the Colonels possession and
thought that the return of the lipstrapped Waterbury with a soothing
note from Mrs Larkyn would merely create a small trouble for a few
minutes Mrs Larkyn knew better She knew that any poison dropped would
find good holdingground in the heart of the Colonels Wife

The packet and a note containing a few remarks on the Colonels
callinghours were sent over to the Colonels Wife who wept in her own
room and took counsel with herself

If there was one woman under Heaven whom the Colonels Wife hated with
holy fervor it was Mrs Larkyn Mrs Larkyn was a frivolous lady
and called the Colonels Wife old cat The Colonels Wife said that
somebody in Revelations was remarkably like Mrs Larkyn She mentioned
other Scripture people as well From the Old Testament But the
Colonels Wife was the only person who cared or dared to say anything
against Mrs Larkyn Every one else accepted her as an amusing honest
little body Wherefore to believe that her husband had been shedding
watches under that Things window at ungodly hours coupled with the
fact of his late arrival on the previous night was

At this point she rose up and sought her husband He denied everything
except the ownership of the watch She besought him for his Souls
sake to speak the truth He denied afresh with two bad words Then a
stony silence held the Colonels Wife while a man could draw his breath
five times

The speech that followed is no affair of mine or yours It was made up
of wifely and womanly jealousy knowledge of old age and sunken cheeks
deep mistrust born of the text that says even little babies hearts
are as bad as they make them rancorous hatred of Mrs Larkyn and the
tenets of the creed of the Colonels Wifes upbringing

Over and above all was the damning lipstrapped Waterbury ticking away
in the palm of her shaking withered hand At that hour I think the
Colonels Wife realized a little of the restless suspicions she had
injected into old Laplaces mind a little of poor Miss Haughtreys
misery and some of the canker that ate into Buxtons heart as he
watched his wife dying before his eyes The Colonel stammered and tried
to explain Then he remembered that his watch had disappeared and the
mystery grew greater The Colonels Wife talked and prayed by turns
till she was tired and went away to devise means for chastening the
stubborn heart of her husband Which translated means in our slang
tailtwisting

You see being deeply impressed with the doctrine of Original Sin she
could not believe in the face of appearances She knew too much and
jumped to the wildest conclusions

But it was good for her It spoilt her life as she had spoilt the life
of the Laplaces She had lost her faith in the Colonel andhere the
creedsuspicion came inhe might she argued have erred many times
before a merciful Providence at the hands of so unworthy an instrument
as Mrs Larkyn had established his guilt He was a bad wicked
grayhaired profligate This may sound too sudden a revulsion for a
longwedded wife but it is a venerable fact that if a man or woman
makes a practice of and takes a delight in believing and spreading
evil of people indifferent to him or her he or she will end in
believing evil of folk very near and dear You may think also that
the mere incident of the watch was too small and trivial to raise this
misunderstanding It is another aged fact that in life as well as
racing all the worst accidents happen at little ditches and cutdown
fences In the same way you sometimes see a woman who would have made a
Joan of Arc in another century and climate threshing herself to pieces
over all the mean worry of housekeeping But that is another story

Her belief only made the Colonels Wife more wretched because it
insisted so strongly on the villainy of men Remembering what she had
done it was pleasant to watch her unhappiness and the pennyfarthing
attempts she made to hide it from the Station But the Station knew and
laughed heartlessly for they had heard the story of the watch with
much dramatic gesture from Mrs Larkyns lips

Once or twice Platte said to Mrs Larkyn seeing that the Colonel had
not cleared himselfThis thing has gone far enough I move we tell
the Colonels Wife how it happened Mrs Larkyn shut her lips and shook
her head and vowed that the Colonels Wife must bear her punishment
as best she could Now Mrs Larkyn was a frivolous woman in whom none
would have suspected deep hate So Platte took no action and came to
believe gradually from the Colonels silence that the Colonel must
have run off the line somewhere that night and therefore preferred
to stand sentence on the lesser count of rambling into other peoples
compounds out of calling hours Platte forgot about the watch business
after a while and moved downcountry with his regiment Mrs Larkyn
went home when her husbands tour of Indian service expired She never
forgot

But Platte was quite right when he said that the joke had gone too far
The mistrust and the tragedy of itwhich we outsiders cannot see and
do not believe inare killing the Colonels Wife and are making the
Colonel wretched If either of them read this story they can depend
upon its being a fairly true account of the case and can kiss and make
friends

Shakespeare alludes to the pleasure of watching an Engineer being
shelled by his own Battery Now this shows that poets should not write
about what they do not understand Any one could have told him that
Sappers and Gunners are perfectly different branches of the Service
But if you correct the sentence and substitute Gunner for Sapper the
moral comes just the same




THE OTHER MAN


 When the earth was sick and the skies were gray
 And the woods were rotted with rain
 The Dead Man rode through the autumn day
 To visit his love again

 Old Ballad


Far back in the seventies before they had built any Public Offices at
Simla and the broad road round Jakko lived in a pigeonhole in the P
W D hovels her parents made Miss Gaurey marry Colonel Schriederling
He could not have been MUCH more than thirtyfive years her senior and
as he lived on two hundred rupees a month and had money of his own
he was well off He belonged to good people and suffered in the cold
weather from lung complaints In the hot weather he dangled on the brink
of heatapoplexy but it never quite killed him

Understand I do not blame Schriederling He was a good husband
according to his lights and his temper only failed him when he was
being nursed Which was some seventeen days in each month He was almost
generous to his wife about money matters and that for him was a
concession Still Mrs Schreiderling was not happy They married her
when she was this side of twenty and had given all her poor little heart
to another man I have forgotten his name but we will call him
the Other Man He had no money and no prospects He was not even
goodlooking and I think he was in the Commissariat or Transport But
in spite of all these things she loved him very madly and there was
some sort of an engagement between the two when Schreiderling appeared
and told Mrs Gaurey that he wished to marry her daughter Then the
other engagement was broken offwashed away by Mrs Gaureys tears
for that lady governed her house by weeping over disobedience to her
authority and the lack of reverence she received in her old age The
daughter did not take after her mother She never cried Not even at the
wedding

The Other Man bore his loss quietly and was transferred to as bad a
station as he could find Perhaps the climate consoled him He suffered
from intermittent fever and that may have distracted him from his other
trouble He was weak about the heart also Both ways One of the valves
was affected and the fever made it worse This showed itself later on

Then many months passed and Mrs Schreiderling took to being ill She
did not pine away like people in story books but she seemed to pick
up every form of illness that went about a station from simple fever
upwards She was never more than ordinarily pretty at the best of times
and the illness made her ugly Schreiderling said so He prided himself
on speaking his mind

When she ceased being pretty he left her to her own devices and went
back to the lairs of his bachelordom She used to trot up and down Simla
Mall in a forlorn sort of way with a gray Terai hat well on the back
of her head and a shocking bad saddle under her Schreiderlings
generosity stopped at the horse He said that any saddle would do for
a woman as nervous as Mrs Schreiderling She never was asked to dance
because she did not dance well and she was so dull and uninteresting
that her box very seldom had any cards in it Schreiderling said that
if he had known that she was going to be such a scarecrow after her
marriage he would never have married her He always prided himself on
speaking his mind did Schreiderling

He left her at Simla one August and went down to his regiment Then she
revived a little but she never recovered her looks I found out at the
Club that the Other Man is coming up sickvery sickon an off chance
of recovery The fever and the heartvalves had nearly killed him She
knew that too and she knewwhat I had no interest in knowingwhen
he was coming up I suppose he wrote to tell her They had not seen each
other since a month before the wedding And here comes the unpleasant
part of the story

A late call kept me down at the Dovedell Hotel till dusk one evening
Mrs Schreidlerling had been flitting up and down the Mall all the
afternoon in the rain Coming up along the Cartroad a tonga passed me
and my pony tired with standing so long set off at a canter Just by
the road down to the Tonga Office Mrs Schreiderling dripping from head
to foot was waiting for the tonga I turned uphill as the tonga was
no affair of mine and just then she began to shriek I went back at
once and saw under the Tonga Office lamps Mrs Schreiderling kneeling
in the wet road by the back seat of the newlyarrived tonga screaming
hideously Then she fell face down in the dirt as I came up

Sitting in the back seat very square and firm with one hand on the
awningstanchion and the wet pouring off his hat and moustache was the
Other Mandead The sixtymile uphill jolt had been too much for his
valve I suppose The tongadriver saidThe Sahib died two stages out
of Solon Therefore I tied him with a rope lest he should fall out
by the way and so came to Simla Will the Sahib give me bukshish IT
pointing to the Other Man should have given one rupee

The Other Man sat with a grin on his face as if he enjoyed the joke of
his arrival and Mrs Schreiderling in the mud began to groan There
was no one except us four in the office and it was raining heavily The
first thing was to take Mrs Schreiderling home and the second was to
prevent her name from being mixed up with the affair The tongadriver
received five rupees to find a bazar rickshaw for Mrs Schreiderling
He was to tell the tonga Babu afterwards of the Other Man and the Babu
was to make such arrangements as seemed best

Mrs Schreiderling was carried into the shed out of the rain and for
threequarters of an hour we two waited for the rickshaw The Other
Man was left exactly as he had arrived Mrs Schreiderling would do
everything but cry which might have helped her She tried to scream as
soon as her senses came back and then she began praying for the Other
Mans soul Had she not been as honest as the day she would have prayed
for her own soul too I waited to hear her do this but she did not
Then I tried to get some of the mud off her habit Lastly the rickshaw
came and I got her awaypartly by force It was a terrible business
from beginning to end but most of all when the rickshaw had to squeeze
between the wall and the tonga and she saw by the lamplight that thin
yellow hand grasping the awningstanchion

She was taken home just as every one was going to a dance at Viceregal
LodgePeterhoff it was thenand the doctor found that she had fallen
from her horse that I had picked her up at the back of Jakko and
really deserved great credit for the prompt manner in which I had
secured medical aid She did not diemen of Schreiderlings stamp marry
women who dont die easily They live and grow ugly

She never told of her one meeting since her marriage with the Other
Man and when the chill and cough following the exposure of that
evening allowed her abroad she never by word or sign alluded to having
met me by the Tonga Office Perhaps she never knew

She used to trot up and down the Mall on that shocking bad saddle
looking as if she expected to meet some one round the corner every
minute Two years afterward she went Home and diedat Bournemouth I
think

Schreiderling when he grew maudlin at Mess used to talk about my
poor dear wife He always set great store on speaking his mind did
Schreiderling




CONSEQUENCES


 Rosicrucian subtleties

 Ye may find their teachers still
 Under Jacatalas Hill

 Read what Flood the Seeker tells us
 Of the Dominant that runs
 Through the cycles of the Suns
 Read my story last and see
 Luna at her apogee


There are yearly appointments and twoyearly appointments and
fiveyearly appointments at Simla and there are or used to be
permanent appointments whereon you stayed up for the term of your
natural life and secured red cheeks and a nice income Of course you
could descend in the cold weather for Simla is rather dull then

Tarrion came from goodness knows whereall away and away in some
forsaken part of Central India where they call Pachmari a Sanitarium
and drive behind trotting bullocks I believe He belonged to a
regiment but what he really wanted to do was to escape from his
regiment and live in Simla forever and ever He had no preference for
anything in particular beyond a good horse and a nice partner He
thought he could do everything well which is a beautiful belief when
you hold it with all your heart He was clever in many ways and good to
look at and always made people round him comfortableeven in Central
India

So he went up to Simla and because he was clever and amusing he
gravitated naturally to Mrs Hauksbee who could forgive everything
but stupidity Once he did her great service by changing the date on an
invitationcard for a big dance which Mrs Hauksbee wished to attend
but couldnt because she had quarrelled with the ADC who took
care being a mean man to invite her to a small dance on the 6th
instead of the big Ball of the 26th It was a very clever piece of
forgery and when Mrs Hauksbee showed the ADC her invitationcard
and chaffed him mildly for not better managing his vendettas he really
thought he had made a mistake andwhich was wiserealized that it
was no use to fight with Mrs Hauksbee She was grateful to Tarrion and
asked what she could do for him He said simply Im a Freelance up
here on leave and on the lookout for what I can loot I havent a
square inch of interest in all Simla My name isnt known to any man
with an appointment in his gift and I want an appointmenta good
sound pukka one I believe you can do anything you turn yourself to do
Will you help me Mrs Hauksbee thought for a minute and passed
the last of her ridingwhip through her lips as was her custom when
thinking Then her eyes sparkled and she saidI will and she shook
hands on it Tarrion having perfect confidence in this great woman
took no further thought of the business at all Except to wonder what
sort of an appointment he would win

Mrs Hauksbee began calculating the prices of all the Heads of
Departments and Members of Council she knew and the more she thought
the more she laughed because her heart was in the game and it amused
her Then she took a Civil List and ran over a few of the appointments
There are some beautiful appointments in the Civil List Eventually she
decided that though Tarrion was too good for the Political Department
she had better begin by trying to get him in there What were her own
plans to this end does not matter in the least for Luck or Fate played
into her hands and she had nothing to do but to watch the course of
events and take the credit of them

All Viceroys when they first come out pass through the Diplomatic
Secrecy craze It wears off in time but they all catch it in the
beginning because they are new to the country The particular Viceroy
who was suffering from the complaint just thenthis was a long time
ago before Lord Dufferin ever came from Canada or Lord Ripon from the
bosom of the English Churchhad it very badly and the result was that
men who were new to keeping official secrets went about looking unhappy
and the Viceroy plumed himself on the way in which he had instilled
notions of reticence into his Staff

Now the Supreme Government have a careless custom of committing
what they do to printed papers These papers deal with all sorts of
thingsfrom the payment of Rs 200 to a secret service native up to
rebukes administered to Vakils and Motamids of Native States and rather
brusque letters to Native Princes telling them to put their houses
in order to refrain from kidnapping women or filling offenders with
pounded red pepper and eccentricities of that kind Of course these
things could never be made public because Native Princes never err
officially and their States are officially as well administered as
Our territories Also the private allowances to various queer people
are not exactly matters to put into newspapers though they give quaint
reading sometimes When the Supreme Government is at Simla these papers
are prepared there and go round to the people who ought to see them in
officeboxes or by post The principle of secrecy was to that Viceroy
quite as important as the practice and he held that a benevolent
despotism like Ours should never allow even little things such as
appointments of subordinate clerks to leak out till the proper time He
was always remarkable for his principles

There was a very important batch of papers in preparation at that time
It had to travel from one end of Simla to the other by hand It was not
put into an official envelope but a large square palepink one the
matter being in MS on soft crinkley paper It was addressed to The
Head Clerk etc etc Now between The Head Clerk etc etc
and Mrs Hauksbee and a flourish is no very great difference if the
address be written in a very bad hand as this was The chaprassi who
took the envelope was not more of an idiot than most chaprassis He
merely forgot where this most unofficial cover was to be delivered and
so asked the first Englishman he met who happened to be a man riding
down to Annandale in a great hurry The Englishman hardly looked said
Hauksbee Sahib ki Mem and went on So did the chaprasss because that
letter was the last in stock and he wanted to get his work over There
was no book to sign he thrust the letter into Mrs Hauksbees bearers
hands and went off to smoke with a friend Mrs Hauksbee was expecting
some cutout pattern things in flimsy paper from a friend As soon
as she got the big square packet therefore she said Oh the
DEAR creature and tore it open with a paperknife and all the MS
enclosures tumbled out on the floor

Mrs Hauksbee began reading I have said the batch was rather
important That is quite enough for you to know It referred to some
correspondence two measures a peremptory order to a native chief and
two dozen other things Mrs Hauksbee gasped as she read for the first
glimpse of the naked machinery of the Great Indian Government stripped
of its casings and lacquer and paint and guardrails impresses even
the most stupid man And Mrs Hauksbee was a clever woman She was
a little afraid at first and felt as if she had laid hold of a
lightningflash by the tail and did not quite know what to do with it
There were remarks and initials at the side of the papers and some
of the remarks were rather more severe than the papers The initials
belonged to men who are all dead or gone now but they were great in
their day Mrs Hauksbee read on and thought calmly as she read Then
the value of her trove struck her and she cast about for the best
method of using it Then Tarrion dropped in and they read through all
the papers together and Tarrion not knowing how she had come by
them vowed that Mrs Hauksbee was the greatest woman on earth Which I
believe was true or nearly so

The honest course is always the best said Tarrion after an hour and a
half of study and conversation All things considered the Intelligence
Branch is about my form Either that or the Foreign Office I go to lay
siege to the High Gods in their Temples

He did not seek a little man or a little big man or a weak Head of a
strong Department but he called on the biggest and strongest man that
the Government owned and explained that he wanted an appointment at
Simla on a good salary The compound insolence of this amused the Strong
Man and as he had nothing to do for the moment he listened to the
proposals of the audacious Tarrion You have I presume some special
qualifications besides the gift of selfassertion for the claims you
put forwards said the Strong Man That Sir said Tarrion is for
you to judge Then he began for he had a good memory quoting a few of
the more important notes in the papersslowly and one by one as a
man drops chlorodyne into a glass When he had reached the peremptory
orderand it WAS a peremptory orderthe Strong Man was troubled

Tarrion wound upAnd I fancy that special knowledge of this kind is
at least as valuable for let us say a berth in the Foreign Office as
the fact of being the nephew of a distinguished officers wife That hit
the Strong Man hard for the last appointment to the Foreign Office had
been by black favor and he knew it Ill see what I can do for you
said the Strong Man Many thanks said Tarrion Then he left and the
Strong Man departed to see how the appointment was to be blocked

         

Followed a pause of eleven days with thunders and lightnings and much
telegraphing The appointment was not a very important one carrying
only between Rs 500 and Rs 700 a month but as the Viceroy said it
was the principle of diplomatic secrecy that had to be maintained
and it was more than likely that a boy so well supplied with special
information would be worth translating So they translated him They
must have suspected him though he protested that his information was
due to singular talents of his own Now much of this story including
the afterhistory of the missing envelope you must fill in for
yourself because there are reasons why it cannot be written If you do
not know about things Up Above you wont understand how to fill it in
and you will say it is impossible

What the Viceroy said when Tarrion was introduced to him wasSo this
is the boy who rushed the Government of India is it Recollect Sir
that is not done TWICE So he must have known something

What Tarrion said when he saw his appointment gazetted wasIf Mrs
Hauksbee were twenty years younger and I her husband I should be
Viceroy of India in twenty years

What Mrs Hauksbee said when Tarrion thanked her almost with tears
in his eyes was firstI told you so and next to herselfWhat
fools men are




THE CONVERSION OF AURELIAN McGOGGIN


 Ride with an idle whip ride with an unused heel
 But once in a way there will come a day
 When the colt must be taught to feel
 The lash that falls and the curb that galls
 and the sting of the rowelled steel

 Lifes Handicap


This is not a tale exactly It is a Tract and I am immensely proud of
it Making a Tract is a Feat

Every man is entitled to his own religious opinions but no manleast
of all a juniorhas a right to thrust these down other mens throats
The Government sends out weird Civilians now and again but McGoggin
was the queerest exported for a long time He was cleverbrilliantly
cleverbut his cleverness worked the wrong way Instead of keeping to
the study of the vernaculars he had read some books written by a
man called Comte I think and a man called Spencer and a Professor
Clifford You will find these books in the Library They deal with
peoples insides from the point of view of men who have no stomachs
There was no order against his reading them but his Mamma should have
smacked him They fermented in his head and he came out to India with
a rarefied religion over and above his work It was not much of a
creed It only proved that men had no souls and there was no God and
no hereafter and that you must worry along somehow for the good of
Humanity

One of its minor tenets seemed to be that the one thing more sinful than
giving an order was obeying it At least that was what McGoggin said
but I suspect he had misread his primers

I do not say a word against this creed It was made up in Town where
there is nothing but machinery and asphalt and buildingall shut in
by the fog Naturally a man grows to think that there is no one higher
than himself and that the Metropolitan Board of Works made everything
But in this country where you really see humanityraw brown naked
humanitywith nothing between it and the blazing sky and only the
usedup overhandled earth underfoot the notion somehow dies away
and most folk come back to simpler theories Life in India is not long
enough to waste in proving that there is no one in particular at the
head of affairs For this reason The Deputy is above the Assistant
the Commissioner above the Deputy the LieutenantGovernor above the
Commissioner and the Viceroy above all four under the orders of the
Secretary of State who is responsible to the Empress If the Empress
be not responsible to her Makerif there is no Maker for her to be
responsible tothe entire system of Our administration must be wrong
Which is manifestly impossible At Home men are to be excused They are
stalled up a good deal and get intellectually beany When you take a
gross beany horse to exercise he slavers and slobbers over the bit
till you cant see the horns But the bit is there just the same Men do
not get beany in India The climate and the work are against playing
bricks with words

If McGoggin had kept his creed with the capital letters and the endings
in isms to himself no one would have cared but his grandfathers on
both sides had been Wesleyan preachers and the preaching strain came
out in his mind He wanted every one at the Club to see that they had no
souls too and to help him to eliminate his Creator As a good many men
told him HE undoubtedly had no soul because he was so young but it
did not follow that his seniors were equally undeveloped and whether
there was another world or not a man still wanted to read his papers in
this But that is not the pointthat is not the point Aurelian used
to say Then men threw sofacushions at him and told him to go to
any particular place he might believe in They christened him the
Blastodermhe said he came from a family of that name somewhere in
the prehistoric agesand by insult and laughter strove to choke him
dumb for he was an unmitigated nuisance at the Club besides being an
offence to the older men His Deputy Commissioner who was working on
the Frontier when Aurelian was rolling on a bedquilt told him that
for a clever boy Aurelian was a very big idiot And you know if
he had gone on with his work he would have been caught up to the
Secretariat in a few years He was just the type that goes thereall
head no physique and a hundred theories Not a soul was interested in
McGoggins soul He might have had two or none or somebodys elses
His business was to obey orders and keep abreast of his files instead of
devastating the Club with isms

He worked brilliantly but he could not accept any order without
trying to better it That was the fault of his creed It made men too
responsible and left too much to their honor You can sometimes ride an
old horse in a halter but never a colt McGoggin took more trouble
over his cases than any of the men of his year He may have fancied that
thirtypage judgments on fiftyrupee casesboth sides perjured to the
gulletadvanced the cause of Humanity At any rate he worked too much
and worried and fretted over the rebukes he received and lectured away
on his ridiculous creed out of office till the Doctor had to warn him
that he was overdoing it No man can toil eighteen annas in the rupee
in June without suffering But McGoggin was still intellectually beany
and proud of himself and his powers and he would take no hint He
worked nine hours a day steadily

Very well said the doctor youll break down because you are
overengined for your beam McGoggin was a little chap

One day the collapse cameas dramatically as if it had been meant to
embellish a Tract

It was just before the Rains We were sitting in the verandah in the
dead hot close air gasping and praying that the blackblue clouds
would let down and bring the cool Very very far away there was a
faint whisper which was the roar of the Rains breaking over the river
One of the men heard it got out of his chair listened and said
naturally enoughThank God

Then the Blastoderm turned in his place and saidWhy I assure you
its only the result of perfectly natural causesatmospheric phenomena
of the simplest kind Why you should therefore return thanks to a
Being who never did existwho is only a figment

Blastoderm grunted the man in the next chair dry up and throw
me over the Pioneer We know all about your figments The Blastoderm
reached out to the table took up one paper and jumped as if something
had stung him Then he handed the paper over

As I was saying he went on slowly and with an effortdue to
perfectly natural causesperfectly natural causes I mean

Hi Blastoderm youve given me the Calcutta Mercantile Advertiser

The dust got up in little whorls while the treetops rocked and the
kites whistled But no one was looking at the coming of the Rains We
were all staring at the Blastoderm who had risen from his chair and was
fighting with his speech Then he said still more slowly

Perfectly conceivabledictionaryred
oakamenablecauseretainingshuttlecockalone

Blastoderms drunk said one man But the Blastoderm was not drunk He
looked at us in a dazed sort of way and began motioning with his hands
in the half light as the clouds closed overhead Thenwith a scream

What is itCantreserveattainablemarketobscure

But his speech seemed to freeze in him andjust as the lightning shot
two tongues that cut the whole sky into three pieces and the rain fell
in quivering sheetsthe Blastoderm was struck dumb He stood pawing and
champing like a hardheld horse and his eyes were full of terror

The Doctor came over in three minutes and heard the story Its
aphasia he said Take him to his room I KNEW the smash would come
We carried the Blastoderm across in the pouring rain to his quarters
and the Doctor gave him bromide of potassium to make him sleep

Then the Doctor came back to us and told us that aphasia was like all
the arrears of Punjab Head falling in a lump and that only once
beforein the case of a sepoyhad he met with so complete a case
I myself have seen mild aphasia in an overworked man but this sudden
dumbness was uncannythough as the Blastoderm himself might have said
due to perfectly natural causes

Hell have to take leave after this said the Doctor He wont be
fit for work for another three months No it isnt insanity or anything
like it Its only complete loss of control over the speech and memory
I fancy it will keep the Blastoderm quiet though

Two days later the Blastoderm found his tongue again The first
question he asked was What was it The Doctor enlightened him But I
cant understand it said the Blastoderm Im quite sane but I cant
be sure of my mind it seemsmy OWN memorycan I

Go up into the Hills for three months and dont think about it said
the Doctor

But I cant understand it repeated the Blastoderm It was my OWN
mind and memory

I cant help it said the Doctor there are a good many things you
cant understand and by the time you have put in my length of service
youll know exactly how much a man dare call his own in this world

The stroke cowed the Blastoderm He could not understand it He went
into the Hills in fear and trembling wondering whether he would be
permitted to reach the end of any sentence he began

This gave him a wholesome feeling of mistrust The legitimate
explanation that he had been overworking himself failed to satisfy
him Something had wiped his lips of speech as a mother wipes the milky
lips of her child and he was afraidhorribly afraid

So the Club had rest when he returned and if ever you come across
Aurelian McGoggin laying down the law on things Humanhe doesnt seem
to know as much as he used to about things Divineput your forefinger
on your lip for a moment and see what happens

Dont blame me if he throws a glass at your head




A GERM DESTROYER


 Pleasant it is for the Little Tin Gods
 When great Jove nods
 But Little Tin Gods make their little mistakes
 In missing the hour when great Jove wakes


As a general rule it is inexpedient to meddle with questions of State
in a land where men are highly paid to work them out for you This tale
is a justifiable exception

Once in every five years as you know we indent for a new Viceroy and
each Viceroy imports with the rest of his baggage a Private Secretary
who may or may not be the real Viceroy just as Fate ordains Fate looks
after the Indian Empire because it is so big and so helpless

There was a Viceroy once who brought out with him a turbulent Private
Secretarya hard man with a soft manner and a morbid passion for
work This Secretary was called WonderJohn Fennil Wonder The Viceroy
possessed no namenothing but a string of counties and twothirds
of the alphabet after them He said in confidence that he was the
electroplated figurehead of a golden administration and he watched
in a dreamy amused way Wonders attempts to draw matters which were
entirely outside his province into his own hands When we are all
cherubims together said His Excellency once my dear good friend
Wonder will head the conspiracy for plucking out Gabriels tailfeathers
or stealing Peters keys THEN I shall report him

But though the Viceroy did nothing to check Wonders officiousness
other people said unpleasant things Maybe the Members of Council began
it but finally all Simla agreed that there was too much Wonder
and too little Viceroy in that regime Wonder was always quoting His
Excellency It was His Excellency this His Excellency that In
the opinion of His Excellency and so on The Viceroy smiled but he
did not heed He said that so long as his old men squabbled with his
dear good Wonder they might be induced to leave the Immemorial
East in peace

No wise man has a policy said the Viceroy A Policy is the blackmail
levied on the Fool by the Unforeseen I am not the former and I do not
believe in the latter

I do not quite see what this means unless it refers to an Insurance
Policy Perhaps it was the Viceroys way of sayingLie low

That season came up to Simla one of these crazy people with only a
single idea These are the men who make things move but they are not
nice to talk to This mans name was Mellish and he had lived for
fifteen years on land of his own in Lower Bengal studying cholera He
held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a
muggy atmosphere and stuck in the branches of trees like a woolflake
The germ could be rendered sterile he said by Mellishs Own
Invincible Fumigatorya heavy violetblack powderthe result of
fifteen years scientific investigation Sir

Inventors seem very much alike as a caste They talk loudly especially
about conspiracies of monopolists they beat upon the table with
their fists and they secrete fragments of their inventions about their
persons

Mellish said that there was a Medical Ring at Simla headed by the
SurgeonGeneral who was in league apparently with all the Hospital
Assistants in the Empire I forget exactly how he proved it but it had
something to do with skulking up to the Hills and what Mellish
wanted was the independent evidence of the ViceroySteward of our
Most Gracious Majesty the Queen Sir So Mellish went up to Simla with
eightyfour pounds of Fumigatory in his trunk to speak to the Viceroy
and to show him the merits of the invention

But it is easier to see a Viceroy than to talk to him unless you chance
to be as important as Mellishe of Madras He was a sixthousandrupee
man so great that his daughters never married They contracted
alliances He himself was not paid He received emoluments and his
journeys about the country were tours of observation His business was
to stir up the people in Madras with a long poleas you stir up stench
in a pondand the people had to come up out of their comfortable old
ways and gaspThis is Enlightenment and progress Isnt it fine
Then they gave Mellishe statues and jasmine garlands in the hope of
getting rid of him

Mellishe came up to Simla to confer with the Viceroy That was one of
his perquisites The Viceroy knew nothing of Mellishe except that he was
one of those middleclass deities who seem necessary to the spiritual
comfort of this Paradise of the Middleclasses and that in all
probability he had suggested designed founded and endowed all the
public institutions in Madras Which proves that His Excellency though
dreamy had experience of the ways of sixthousandrupee men

Mellishes name was E Mellishe and Mellishs was E S Mellish and
they were both staying at the same hotel and the Fate that looks after
the Indian Empire ordained that Wonder should blunder and drop the final
e that the Chaprassi should help him and that the note which ran
Dear Mr MellishCan you set aside your other engagements and lunch
with us at two tomorrow His Excellency has an hour at your disposal
then should be given to Mellish with the Fumigatory He nearly wept
with pride and delight and at the appointed hour cantered off to
Peterhoff a big paperbag full of the Fumigatory in his coattail
pockets He had his chance and he meant to make the most of
it Mellishe of Madras had been so portentously solemn about his
conference that Wonder had arranged for a private tiffinno AD
Cs no Wonder no one but the Viceroy who said plaintively that he
feared being left alone with unmuzzled autocrats like the great Mellishe
of Madras

But his guest did not bore the Viceroy On the contrary he amused him
Mellish was nervously anxious to go straight to his Fumigatory and
talked at random until tiffin was over and His Excellency asked him
to smoke The Viceroy was pleased with Mellish because he did not talk
shop

As soon as the cheroots were lit Mellish spoke like a man beginning
with his choleratheory reviewing his fifteen years scientific
labors the machinations of the Simla Ring and the excellence of
his Fumigatory while the Viceroy watched him between halfshut eyes
and thought Evidently this is the wrong tiger but it is an original
animal Mellishs hair was standing on end with excitement and he
stammered He began groping in his coattails and before the Viceroy
knew what was about to happen he had tipped a bagful of his powder into
the big silver ashtray

Jjjudge for yourself Sir said Mellish Y Excellency shall judge
for yourself Absolutely infallible on my honor

He plunged the lighted end of his cigar into the powder which began to
smoke like a volcano and send up fat greasy wreaths of coppercolored
smoke In five seconds the room was filled with a most pungent and
sickening stencha reek that took fierce hold of the trap of your
windpipe and shut it The powder then hissed and fizzed and sent out
blue and green sparks and the smoke rose till you could neither see
nor breathe nor gasp Mellish however was used to it

Nitrate of strontia he shouted baryta bonemeal etcetera
Thousand cubic feet smoke per cubic inch Not a germ could livenot a
germ Y Excellency

But His Excellency had fled and was coughing at the foot of the stairs
while all Peterhoff hummed like a hive Red Lancers came in and the
Head Chaprassi who speaks English came in and macebearers came in
and ladies ran downstairs screaming fire for the smoke was drifting
through the house and oozing out of the windows and bellying along the
verandahs and wreathing and writhing across the gardens No one could
enter the room where Mellish was lecturing on his Fumigatory till that
unspeakable powder had burned itself out

Then an AidedeCamp who desired the V C rushed through the rolling
clouds and hauled Mellish into the hall The Viceroy was prostrate with
laughter and could only waggle his hands feebly at Mellish who was
shaking a fresh bagful of powder at him

Glorious Glorious sobbed his Excellency Not a germ as you justly
observe could exist I can swear it A magnificent success

Then he laughed till the tears came and Wonder who had caught the real
Mellishe snorting on the Mall entered and was deeply shocked at the
scene But the Viceroy was delighted because he saw that Wonder would
presently depart Mellish with the Fumigatory was also pleased for he
felt that he had smashed the Simla Medical Ring

         

Few men could tell a story like His Excellency when he took the trouble
and the account of my dear good Wonders friend with the powder
went the round of Simla and flippant folk made Wonder unhappy by their
remarks

But His Excellency told the tale once too oftenfor Wonder As he meant
to do It was at a Seepee Picnic Wonder was sitting just behind the
Viceroy

And I really thought for a moment wound up His Excellency that my
dear good Wonder had hired an assassin to clear his way to the throne

Every one laughed but there was a delicate subtinkle in the Viceroys
tone which Wonder understood He found that his health was giving way
and the Viceroy allowed him to go and presented him with a flaming
character for use at Home among big people

My fault entirely said His Excellency in after seasons with
a twinkling in his eye My inconsistency must always have been
distasteful to such a masterly man




KIDNAPPED


 There is a tide in the affairs of men
 Which taken any way you please is bad
 And strands them in forsaken guts and creeks
 No decent soul would think of visiting
 You cannot stop the tide but now and then
 You may arrest some rash adventurer
 Whohmwill hardly thank you for your pains

 Vibarts Moralities



We are a highcaste and enlightened race and infantmarriage is very
shocking and the consequences are sometimes peculiar but nevertheless
the Hindu notionwhich is the Continental notionwhich is the
aboriginal notionof arranging marriages irrespective of the personal
inclinations of the married is sound Think for a minute and you will
see that it must be so unless of course you believe in affinities
In which case you had better not read this tale How can a man who has
never married who cannot be trusted to pick up at sight a moderately
sound horse whose head is hot and upset with visions of domestic
felicity go about the choosing of a wife He cannot see straight or
think straight if he tries and the same disadvantages exist in the
case of a girls fancies But when mature married and discreet people
arrange a match between a boy and a girl they do it sensibly with a
view to the future and the young couple live happily ever afterwards
As everybody knows

Properly speaking Government should establish a Matrimonial Department
efficiently officered with a Jury of Matrons a Judge of the Chief
Court a Senior Chaplain and an Awful Warning in the shape of a
lovematch that has gone wrong chained to the trees in the courtyard
All marriages should be made through the Department which might be
subordinate to the Educational Department under the same penalty as
that attaching to the transfer of land without a stamped document But
Government wont take suggestions It pretends that it is too busy
However I will put my notion on record and explain the example that
illustrates the theory

Once upon a time there was a good young mana firstclass officer in
his own Departmenta man with a career before him and possibly a K
C G E at the end of it All his superiors spoke well of him because
he knew how to hold his tongue and his pen at the proper times There
are today only eleven men in India who possess this secret and they
have all with one exception attained great honor and enormous incomes

This good young man was quiet and selfcontainedtoo old for his years
by far Which always carries its own punishment Had a Subaltern or a
TeaPlanters Assistant or anybody who enjoys life and has no care for
tomorrow done what he tried to do not a soul would have cared
But when Peythroppethe estimable virtuous economical quiet
hardworking young Peythroppefell there was a flutter through five
Departments

The manner of his fall was in this way He met a Miss
CastriesdCastries it was originally but the family dropped the
d for administrative reasonsand he fell in love with her even more
energetically that he worked Understand clearly that there was not a
breath of a word to be said against Miss Castriesnot a shadow of a
breath She was good and very lovelypossessed what innocent people at
home call a Spanish complexion with thick blueblack hair growing low
down on her forehead into a widows peak and big violet eyes
under eyebrows as black and as straight as the borders of a Gazette
Extraordinary when a big man dies Butbutbut Well she was a VERY
sweet girl and very pious but for many reasons she was impossible
Quite so All good Mammas know what impossible means It was obviously
absurd that Peythroppe should marry her The little opaltinted onyx
at the base of her fingernails said this as plainly as print
Further marriage with Miss Castries meant marriage with several other
CastriesHonorary Lieutenant Castries her Papa Mrs Eulalie Castries
her Mamma and all the ramifications of the Castries family on incomes
ranging from Rs 175 to Rs 470 a month and THEIR wives and connections
again

It would have been cheaper for Peythroppe to have assaulted a
Commissioner with a dogwhip or to have burned the records of a Deputy
Commissioners Office than to have contracted an alliance with the
Castries It would have weighted his aftercareer lesseven under a
Government which never forgets and NEVER forgives Everybody saw this
but Peythroppe He was going to marry Miss Castries he wasbeing of
age and drawing a good incomeand woe betide the house that would not
afterwards receive Mrs Virginie Saulez Peythroppe with the deference
due to her husbands rank That was Peythroppes ultimatum and any
remonstrance drove him frantic

These sudden madnesses most afflict the sanest men There was a case
oncebut I will tell you of that later on You cannot account for the
mania except under a theory directly contradicting the one about the
Place wherein marriages are made Peythroppe was burningly anxious to
put a millstone round his neck at the outset of his career and argument
had not the least effect on him He was going to marry Miss Castries
and the business was his own business He would thank you to keep your
advice to yourself With a man in this condition mere words only fix
him in his purpose Of course he cannot see that marriage out here does
not concern the individual but the Government he serves

Do you remember Mrs Hauksbeethe most wonderful woman in India She
saved Pluffles from Mrs Reiver won Tarrion his appointment in the
Foreign Office and was defeated in open field by Mrs CusackBremmil
She heard of the lamentable condition of Peythroppe and her brain
struck out the plan that saved him She had the wisdom of the Serpent
the logical coherence of the Man the fearlessness of the Child and
the triple intuition of the Woman Neverno neveras long as a tonga
buckets down the Solon dip or the couples go ariding at the back of
Summer Hill will there be such a genius as Mrs Hauksbee She attended
the consultation of Three Men on Peythroppes case and she stood up
with the lash of her ridingwhip between her lips and spake

         

Three weeks later Peythroppe dined with the Three Men and the Gazette
of India came in Peythroppe found to his surprise that he had been
gazetted a months leave Dont ask me how this was managed I believe
firmly that if Mrs Hauksbee gave the order the whole Great Indian
Administration would stand on its head

The Three Men had also a months leave each Peythroppe put the Gazette
down and said bad words Then there came from the compound the soft
padpad of camelsthieves camels the bikaneer breed that dont
bubble and howl when they sit down and get up

After that I dont know what happened This much is certain Peythroppe
disappearedvanished like smokeand the long footrest chair in the
house of the Three Men was broken to splinters Also a bedstead departed
from one of the bedrooms

Mrs Hauksbee said that Mr Peythroppe was shooting in Rajputana with
the Three Men so we were compelled to believe her

At the end of the month Peythroppe was gazetted twenty days extension
of leave but there was wrath and lamentation in the house of Castries
The marriageday had been fixed but the bridegroom never came and the
DSilvas Pereiras and Ducketts lifted their voices and mocked Honorary
Lieutenant Castries as one who had been basely imposed upon Mrs
Hauksbee went to the wedding and was much astonished when Peythroppe
did not appear After seven weeks Peythroppe and the Three Men returned
from Rajputana Peythroppe was in hard tough condition rather white
and more selfcontained than ever

One of the Three Men had a cut on his nose cause by the kick of a gun
Twelvebores kick rather curiously

Then came Honorary Lieutenant Castries seeking for the blood of his
perfidious soninlaw to be He said thingsvulgar and impossible
things which showed the raw rough ranker below the Honorary and I
fancy Peythroppes eyes were opened Anyhow he held his peace till the
end when he spoke briefly Honorary Lieutenant Castries asked for a
peg before he went away to die or bring a suit for breach of promise

Miss Castries was a very good girl She said that she would have no
breach of promise suits She said that if she was not a lady she
was refined enough to know that ladies kept their broken hearts to
themselves and as she ruled her parents nothing happened Later on
she married a most respectable and gentlemanly person He travelled for
an enterprising firm in Calcutta and was all that a good husband should
be

So Peythroppe came to his right mind again and did much good work and
was honored by all who knew him One of these days he will marry but he
will marry a sweet pinkandwhite maiden on the Government House List
with a little money and some influential connections as every wise man
should And he will never all his life tell her what happened during
the seven weeks of his shootingtour in Rajputana

But just think how much trouble and expensefor camel hire is not
cheap and those Bikaneer brutes had to be fed like humansmight have
been saved by a properly conducted Matrimonial Department under the
control of the Director General of Education but corresponding direct
with the Viceroy

 The Unedited Autobiography of Private Ortheris


IF there was one thing on which Golightly prided himself more than
another it was looking like an Officer and a gentleman He said it
was for the honor of the Service that he attired himself so elaborately
but those who knew him best said that it was just personal vanity There
was no harm about Golightlynot an ounce He recognized a horse when
he saw one and could do more than fill a cantle He played a very fair
game at billiards and was a sound man at the whisttable Everyone
liked him and nobody ever dreamed of seeing him handcuffed on a station
platform as a deserter But this sad thing happened

He was going down from Dalhousie at the end of his leaveriding down
He had cut his leave as fine as he dared and wanted to come down in a
hurry

It was fairly warm at Dalhousie and knowing what to expect below he
descended in a new khaki suittight fittingof a delicate olivegreen
a peacockblue tie white collar and a snowy white solah helmet He
prided himself on looking neat even when he was riding post He did
look neat and he was so deeply concerned about his appearance before he
started that he quite forgot to take anything but some small change with
him He left all his notes at the hotel His servants had gone down the
road before him to be ready in waiting at Pathankote with a change of
gear That was what he called travelling in light marchingorder He
was proud of his faculty of organizationwhat we call bundobust

Twentytwo miles out of Dalhousie it began to rainnot a mere
hillshower but a good tepid monsoonish downpour Golightly bustled
on wishing that he had brought an umbrella The dust on the roads
turned into mud and the pony mired a good deal So did Golightlys
khaki gaiters But he kept on steadily and tried to think how pleasant
the coolth was

His next pony was rather a brute at starting and Golightlys hands
being slippery with the rain contrived to get rid of Golightly at a
corner He chased the animal caught it and went ahead briskly The
spill had not improved his clothes or his temper and he had lost one
spur He kept the other one employed By the time that stage was ended
the pony had had as much exercise as he wanted and in spite of the
rain Golightly was sweating freely At the end of another miserable
halfhour Golightly found the world disappear before his eyes in clammy
pulp The rain had turned the pith of his huge and snowy solahtopee
into an evilsmelling dough and it had closed on his head like a
halfopened mushroom Also the green lining was beginning to run

Golightly did not say anything worth recording here He tore off and
squeezed up as much of the brim as was in his eyes and ploughed on The
back of the helmet was flapping on his neck and the sides stuck to
his ears but the leather band and green lining kept things roughly
together so that the hat did not actually melt away where it flapped

Presently the pulp and the green stuff made a sort of slimy mildew
which ran over Golightly in several directionsdown his back and
bosom for choice The khaki color ran tooit was really shockingly bad
dyeand sections of Golightly were brown and patches were violet
and contours were ochre and streaks were ruddy red and blotches were
nearly white according to the nature and peculiarities of the dye
When he took out his handkerchief to wipe his face and the green of the
hatlining and the purple stuff that had soaked through on to his neck
from the tie became thoroughly mixed the effect was amazing

Near Dhar the rain stopped and the evening sun came out and dried him up
slightly It fixed the colors too Three miles from Pathankote the last
pony fell dead lame and Golightly was forced to walk He pushed on
into Pathankote to find his servants He did not know then that his
khitmatgar had stopped by the roadside to get drunk and would come on
the next day saying that he had sprained his ankle When he got into
Pathankote he couldnt find his servants his boots were stiff and ropy
with mud and there were large quantities of dirt about his body The
blue tie had run as much as the khaki So he took it off with the collar
and threw it away Then he said something about servants generally and
tried to get a peg He paid eight annas for the drink and this revealed
to him that he had only six annas more in his pocketor in the world as
he stood at that hour

He went to the StationMaster to negotiate for a firstclass ticket to
Khasa where he was stationed The bookingclerk said something to
the StationMaster the StationMaster said something to the Telegraph
Clerk and the three looked at him with curiosity They asked him to
wait for halfanhour while they telegraphed to Umritsar for
authority So he waited and four constables came and grouped themselves
picturesquely round him Just as he was preparing to ask them to go
away the StationMaster said that he would give the Sahib a ticket
to Umritsar if the Sahib would kindly come inside the bookingoffice
Golightly stepped inside and the next thing he knew was that a
constable was attached to each of his legs and arms while the
StationMaster was trying to cram a mailbag over his head

There was a very fair scuffle all round the bookingoffice and
Golightly received a nasty cut over his eye through falling against
a table But the constables were too much for him and they and the
StationMaster handcuffed him securely As soon as the mailbag was
slipped he began expressing his opinions and the headconstable
saidWithout doubt this is the soldierEnglishman we required Listen
to the abuse Then Golightly asked the StationMaster what the this
and the that the proceedings meant The StationMaster told him he was
Private John Binkle of the  Regiment 5 ft 9 in fair hair
gray eyes and a dissipated appearance no marks on the body who had
deserted a fortnight ago Golightly began explaining at great length
and the more he explained the less the StationMaster believed him He
said that no Lieutenant could look such a ruffian as did Golightly and
that his instructions were to send his capture under proper escort to
Umritsar Golightly was feeling very damp and uncomfortable and the
language he used was not fit for publication even in an expurgated
form The four constables saw him safe to Umritsar in an intermediate
compartment and he spent the fourhour journey in abusing them as
fluently as his knowledge of the vernaculars allowed

At Umritsar he was bundled out on the platform into the arms of a
Corporal and two men of the  Regiment Golightly drew himself up
and tried to carry off matters jauntily He did not feel too jaunty in
handcuffs with four constables behind him and the blood from the
cut on his forehead stiffening on his left cheek The Corporal was not
jocular either Golightly got as far asThis is a very absurd mistake
my men when the Corporal told him to stow his lip and come along
Golightly did not want to come along He desired to stop and explain
He explained very well indeed until the Corporal cut in withYOU
a orficer Its the like o YOU as brings disgrace on the likes of US
Bloomin fine orficer you are I know your regiment The Rogues
March is the quickstep where you come from Youre a black shame to the
Service

Golightly kept his temper and began explaining all over again from the
beginning Then he was marched out of the rain into the refreshmentroom
and told not to make a qualified fool of himself The men were going to
run him up to Fort Govindghar And running up is a performance almost
as undignified as the Frog March

Golightly was nearly hysterical with rage and the chill and the mistake
and the handcuffs and the headache that the cut on his forehead had
given him He really laid himself out to express what was in his mind
When he had quite finished and his throat was feeling dry one of the
men saidIve eard a few beggars in the click blind stiff and crack
on a bit but Ive never eard any one to touch this ere orficer
They were not angry with him They rather admired him They had some
beer at the refreshmentroom and offered Golightly some too because
he had swore wonerful They asked him to tell them all about the
adventures of Private John Binkle while he was loose on the countryside
and that made Golightly wilder than ever If he had kept his wits about
him he would have kept quiet until an officer came but he attempted to
run

Now the butt of a Martini in the small of your back hurts a great deal
and rotten rainsoaked khaki tears easily when two men are jerking at
your collar

Golightly rose from the floor feeling very sick and giddy with his
shirt ripped open all down his breast and nearly all down his back He
yielded to his luck and at that point the downtrain from Lahore came
in carrying one of Golightlys Majors

This is the Majors evidence in full

There was the sound of a scuffle in the secondclass refreshmentroom
so I went in and saw the most villainous loafer that I ever set eyes on
His boots and breeches were plastered with mud and beerstains He wore
a muddywhite dunghill sort of thing on his head and it hung down in
slips on his shoulders which were a good deal scratched He was half in
and half out of a shirt as nearly in two pieces as it could be and he
was begging the guard to look at the name on the tail of it As he had
rucked the shirt all over his head I couldnt at first see who he was
but I fancied that he was a man in the first stage of D T from the way
he swore while he wrestled with his rags When he turned round and I
had made allowance for a lump as big as a porkpie over one eye and
some green warpaint on the face and some violet stripes round the
neck I saw that it was Golightly He was very glad to see me said the
Major and he hoped I would not tell the Mess about it I didnt but
you can if you like now that Golightly has gone Home

Golightly spent the greater part of that summer in trying to get the
Corporal and the two soldiers tried by CourtMartial for arresting an
officer and a gentleman They were of course very sorry for their
error But the tale leaked into the regimental canteen and thence ran
about the Province




THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO


 A stones throw out on either hand
 From that wellordered road we tread
 And all the world is wild and strange
 Churel and ghoul and Djinn and sprite
 Shall bear us company tonight
 For we have reached the Oldest Land
 Wherein the Powers of Darkness range

 From the Dusk to the Dawn


The house of Suddhoo near the Taksali Gate is twostoried with four
carved windows of old brown wood and a flat roof You may recognize
it by five red handprints arranged like the Five of Diamonds on the
whitewash between the upper windows Bhagwan Dass the bunnia and a
man who says he gets his living by sealcutting live in the lower story
with a troop of wives servants friends and retainers The two upper
rooms used to be occupied by Janoo and Azizun and a little blackandtan
terrier that was stolen from an Englishmans house and given to Janoo by
a soldier Today only Janoo lives in the upper rooms Suddhoo sleeps
on the roof generally except when he sleeps in the street He used
to go to Peshawar in the cold weather to visit his son who sells
curiosities near the Edwardes Gate and then he slept under a real mud
roof Suddhoo is a great friend of mine because his cousin had a son
who secured thanks to my recommendation the post of headmessenger
to a big firm in the Station Suddhoo says that God will make me a
LieutenantGovernor one of these days I daresay his prophecy will come
true He is very very old with white hair and no teeth worth showing
and he has outlived his witsoutlived nearly everything except his
fondness for his son at Peshawar Janoo and Azizun are Kashmiris
Ladies of the City and theirs was an ancient and more or less honorable
profession but Azizun has since married a medical student from the
NorthWest and has settled down to a most respectable life somewhere
near Bareilly Bhagwan Dass is an extortionate and an adulterator He
is very rich The man who is supposed to get his living by sealcutting
pretends to be very poor This lets you know as much as is necessary of
the four principal tenants in the house of Suddhoo Then there is Me
of course but I am only the chorus that comes in at the end to explain
things So I do not count

Suddhoo was not clever The man who pretended to cut seals was the
cleverest of them allBhagwan Dass only knew how to lieexcept Janoo
She was also beautiful but that was her own affair

Suddhoos son at Peshawar was attacked by pleurisy and old Suddhoo
was troubled The sealcutter man heard of Suddhoos anxiety and made
capital out of it He was abreast of the times He got a friend in
Peshawar to telegraph daily accounts of the sons health And here the
story begins

Suddhoos cousins son told me one evening that Suddhoo wanted to see
me that he was too old and feeble to come personally and that I should
be conferring an everlasting honor on the House of Suddhoo if I went to
him I went but I think seeing how welloff Suddhoo was then that he
might have sent something better than an ekka which jolted fearfully
to haul out a future LieutenantGovernor to the City on a muggy April
evening The ekka did not run quickly It was full dark when we pulled
up opposite the door of Ranjit Singhs Tomb near the main gate of the
Fort Here was Suddhoo and he said that by reason of my condescension
it was absolutely certain that I should become a LieutenantGovernor
while my hair was yet black Then we talked about the weather and the
state of my health and the wheat crops for fifteen minutes in the
Huzuri Bagh under the stars

Suddhoo came to the point at last He said that Janoo had told him that
there was an order of the Sirkar against magic because it was feared
that magic might one day kill the Empress of India I didnt know
anything about the state of the law but I fancied that something
interesting was going to happen I said that so far from magic being
discouraged by the Government it was highly commended The greatest
officials of the State practiced it themselves If the Financial
Statement isnt magic I dont know what is Then to encourage him
further I said that if there was any jadoo afoot I had not the least
objection to giving it my countenance and sanction and to seeing that
it was clean jadoowhite magic as distinguished from the unclean jadoo
which kills folk It took a long time before Suddhoo admitted that this
was just what he had asked me to come for Then he told me in jerks
and quavers that the man who said he cut seals was a sorcerer of the
cleanest kind that every day he gave Suddhoo news of the sick son in
Peshawar more quickly than the lightning could fly and that this
news was always corroborated by the letters Further that he had told
Suddhoo how a great danger was threatening his son which could be
removed by clean jadoo and of course heavy payment I began to see
how the land lay and told Suddhoo that I also understood a little jadoo
in the Western line and would go to his house to see that everything
was done decently and in order We set off together and on the way
Suddhoo told me he had paid the sealcutter between one hundred and
two hundred rupees already and the jadoo of that night would cost two
hundred more Which was cheap he said considering the greatness of his
sons danger but I do not think he meant it

The lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when we arrived I
could hear awful noises from behind the sealcutters shopfront as if
some one were groaning his soul out Suddhoo shook all over and while
we groped our way upstairs told me that the jadoo had begun Janoo and
Azizun met us at the stairhead and told us that the jadoowork was
coming off in their rooms because there was more space there Janoo is
a lady of a freethinking turn of mind She whispered that the jadoo was
an invention to get money out of Suddhoo and that the sealcutter would
go to a hot place when he died Suddhoo was nearly crying with fear
and old age He kept walking up and down the room in the half light
repeating his sons name over and over again and asking Azizun if
the sealcutter ought not to make a reduction in the case of his own
landlord Janoo pulled me over to the shadow in the recess of the carved
bowwindows The boards were up and the rooms were only lit by one tiny
lamp There was no chance of my being seen if I stayed still

Presently the groans below ceased and we heard steps on the staircase
That was the sealcutter He stopped outside the door as the terrier
barked and Azizun fumbled at the chain and he told Suddhoo to blow out
the lamp This left the place in jet darkness except for the red glow
from the two huqas that belonged to Janoo and Azizun The sealcutter
came in and I heard Suddhoo throw himself down on the floor and groan
Azizun caught her breath and Janoo backed to one of the beds with a
shudder There was a clink of something metallic and then shot up a
pale bluegreen flame near the ground The light was just enough to show
Azizun pressed against one corner of the room with the terrier between
her knees Janoo with her hands clasped leaning forward as she sat on
the bed Suddhoo face down quivering and the sealcutter

I hope I may never see another man like that sealcutter He was
stripped to the waist with a wreath of white jasmine as thick as my
wrist round his forehead a salmoncolored loincloth round his middle
and a steel bangle on each ankle This was not aweinspiring It was
the face of the man that turned me cold It was bluegray in the first
place In the second the eyes were rolled back till you could only
see the whites of them and in the third the face was the face of
a demona ghoulanything you please except of the sleek oily old
ruffian who sat in the daytime over his turninglathe downstairs He
was lying on his stomach with his arms turned and crossed behind him
as if he had been thrown down pinioned His head and neck were the only
parts of him off the floor They were nearly at right angles to the
body like the head of a cobra at spring It was ghastly In the centre
of the room on the bare earth floor stood a big deep brass basin
with a pale bluegreen light floating in the centre like a nightlight
Round that basin the man on the floor wriggled himself three times How
he did it I do not know I could see the muscles ripple along his spine
and fall smooth again but I could not see any other motion The head
seemed the only thing alive about him except that slow curl and uncurl
of the laboring backmuscles Janoo from the bed was breathing seventy
to the minute Azizun held her hands before her eyes and old Suddhoo
fingering at the dirt that had got into his white beard was crying to
himself The horror of it was that the creeping crawly thing made no
soundonly crawled And remember this lasted for ten minutes while
the terrier whined and Azizun shuddered and Janoo gasped and Suddhoo
cried

I felt the hair lift at the back of my head and my heart thump like a
thermantidote paddle Luckily the sealcutter betrayed himself by his
most impressive trick and made me calm again After he had finished that
unspeakable triple crawl he stretched his head away from the floor as
high as he could and sent out a jet of fire from his nostrils Now I
knew how firespouting is doneI can do it myselfso I felt at ease
The business was a fraud If he had only kept to that crawl without
trying to raise the effect goodness knows what I might not have
thought Both the girls shrieked at the jet of fire and the head
dropped chin down on the floor with a thud the whole body lying then
like a corpse with its arms trussed There was a pause of five full
minutes after this and the bluegreen flame died down Janoo stooped to
settle one of her anklets while Azizun turned her face to the wall and
took the terrier in her arms Suddhoo put out an arm mechanically to
Janoos huqa and she slid it across the floor with her foot Directly
above the body and on the wall were a couple of flaming portraits in
stamped paper frames of the Queen and the Prince of Wales They looked
down on the performance and to my thinking seemed to heighten the
grotesqueness of it all

Just when the silence was getting unendurable the body turned over and
rolled away from the basin to the side of the room where it lay stomach
up There was a faint plop from the basinexactly like the noise
a fish makes when it takes a flyand the green light in the centre
revived

I looked at the basin and saw bobbing in the water the dried
shrivelled black head of a native babyopen eyes open mouth and
shaved scalp It was worse being so very sudden than the crawling
exhibition We had no time to say anything before it began to speak

Read Poes account of the voice that came from the mesmerized dying man
and you will realize less than onehalf of the horror of that heads
voice

There was an interval of a second or two between each word and a sort
of ring ring ring in the note of the voice like the timbre of a
bell It pealed slowly as if talking to itself for several minutes
before I got rid of my cold sweat Then the blessed solution struck me
I looked at the body lying near the doorway and saw just where the
hollow of the throat joins on the shoulders a muscle that had nothing
to do with any mans regular breathing twitching away steadily The
whole thing was a careful reproduction of the Egyptian teraphin that
one read about sometimes and the voice was as clever and as appalling a
piece of ventriloquism as one could wish to hear All this time the head
was lipliplapping against the side of the basin and speaking It
told Suddhoo on his face again whining of his sons illness and of
the state of the illness up to the evening of that very night I always
shall respect the sealcutter for keeping so faithfully to the time
of the Peshawar telegrams It went on to say that skilled doctors were
night and day watching over the mans life and that he would eventually
recover if the fee to the potent sorcerer whose servant was the head in
the basin were doubled

Here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in To ask for
twice your stipulated fee in a voice that Lazarus might have used
when he rose from the dead is absurd Janoo who is really a woman of
masculine intellect saw this as quickly as I did I heard her say Asli
nahin Fareib scornfully under her breath and just as she said so
the light in the basin died out the head stopped talking and we heard
the room door creak on its hinges Then Janoo struck a match lit the
lamp and we saw that head basin and sealcutter were gone Suddhoo
was wringing his hands and explaining to any one who cared to listen
that if his chances of eternal salvation depended on it he could not
raise another two hundred rupees Azizun was nearly in hysterics in the
corner while Janoo sat down composedly on one of the beds to discuss
the probabilities of the whole thing being a bunao or makeup

I explained as much as I knew of the sealcutters way of jadoo but
her argument was much more simpleThe magic that is always demanding
gifts is no true magic said she My mother told me that the
only potent lovespells are those which are told you for love This
sealcutter man is a liar and a devil I dare not tell do anything or
get anything done because I am in debt to Bhagwan Dass the bunnia for
two gold rings and a heavy anklet I must get my food from his shop The
sealcutter is the friend of Bhagwan Dass and he would poison my food
A fools jadoo has been going on for ten days and has cost Suddhoo
many rupees each night The sealcutter used black hens and lemons and
mantras before He never showed us anything like this till tonight
Azizun is a fool and will be a pur dahnashin soon Suddhoo has lost
his strength and his wits See now I had hoped to get from Suddhoo many
rupees while he lived and many more after his death and behold he
is spending everything on that offspring of a devil and a sheass the
sealcutter

Here I saidBut what induced Suddhoo to drag me into the business
Of course I can speak to the sealcutter and he shall refund The whole
thing is childs talkshameand senseless

Suddhoo IS an old child said Janoo He has lived on the roofs these
seventy years and is as senseless as a milchgoat He brought you here
to assure himself that he was not breaking any law of the Sirkar whose
salt he ate many years ago He worships the dust off the feet of the
sealcutter and that cowdevourer has forbidden him to go and see his
son What does Suddhoo know of your laws or the lightningpost I have
to watch his money going day by day to that lying beast below

Janoo stamped her foot on the floor and nearly cried with vexation
while Suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket in the corner and Azizun
was trying to guide the pipestem to his foolish old mouth

         

Now the case stands thus Unthinkingly I have laid myself open to the
charge of aiding and abetting the sealcutter in obtaining money under
false pretences which is forbidden by Section 420 of the Indian Penal
Code I am helpless in the matter for these reasons I cannot inform
the Police What witnesses would support my statements Janoo refuses
flatly Azizun is a veiled woman somewhere near Bareillylost in this
big India of ours I cannot again take the law into my own hands and
speak to the sealcutter for certain am I that not only would Suddhoo
disbelieve me but this step would end in the poisoning of Janoo who is
bound hand and foot by her debt to the bunnia Suddhoo is an old dotard
and whenever we meet mumbles my idiotic joke that the Sirkar rather
patronizes the Black Art than otherwise His son is well now but
Suddhoo is completely under the influence of the sealcutter by whose
advice he regulates the affairs of his life Janoo watches daily the
money that she hoped to wheedle out of Suddhoo taken by the sealcutter
and becomes daily more furious and sullen

She will never tell because she dare not but unless something
happens to prevent her I am afraid that the sealcutter will die of
cholerathe white arsenic kindabout the middle of May And thus I
shall have to be privy to a murder in the House of Suddhoo

 Vibarts Moralities


Shakespeare says something about worms or it may be giants or beetles
turning if you tread on them too severely The safest plan is never to
tread on a wormnot even on the last new subaltern from Home with his
buttons hardly out of their tissue paper and the red of sappy English
beef in his cheeks This is the story of the worm that turned For
the sake of brevity we will call Henry Augustus Ramsay Faizanne The
Worm although he really was an exceedingly pretty boy without a hair
on his face and with a waist like a girls when he came out to the
Second Shikarris and was made unhappy in several ways The Shikarris
are a highcaste regiment and you must be able to do things wellplay
a banjo or ride more than a little or sing or actto get on with
them

The Worm did nothing except fall off his pony and knock chips out of
gateposts with his trap Even that became monotonous after a time He
objected to whist cut the cloth at billiards sang out of tune kept
very much to himself and wrote to his Mamma and sisters at Home Four
of these five things were vices which the Shikarris objected to and
set themselves to eradicate Every one knows how subalterns are by
brother subalterns softened and not permitted to be ferocious It is
good and wholesome and does no one any harm unless tempers are lost
and then there is trouble There was a man oncebut that is another
story

The Shikarris shikarred The Worm very much and he bore everything
without winking He was so good and so anxious to learn and flushed
so pink that his education was cut short and he was left to his own
devices by every one except the Senior Subaltern who continued to make
life a burden to The Worm The Senior Subaltern meant no harm but his
chaff was coarse and he didnt quite understand where to stop He had
been waiting too long for his company and that always sours a man Also
he was in love which made him worse

One day after he had borrowed The Worms trap for a lady who never
existed had used it himself all the afternoon had sent a note to The
Worm purporting to come from the lady and was telling the Mess all
about it The Worm rose in his place and said in his quiet ladylike
voice That was a very pretty sell but Ill lay you a months pay to
a months pay when you get your step that I work a sell on you that
youll remember for the rest of your days and the Regiment after you
when youre dead or broke The Worm wasnt angry in the least and the
rest of the Mess shouted Then the Senior Subaltern looked at The Worm
from the boots upwards and down again and said Done Baby The Worm
took the rest of the Mess to witness that the bet had been taken and
retired into a book with a sweet smile

Two months passed and the Senior Subaltern still educated The Worm
who began to move about a little more as the hot weather came on I have
said that the Senior Subaltern was in love The curious thing is that
a girl was in love with the Senior Subaltern Though the Colonel said
awful things and the Majors snorted and married Captains looked
unutterable wisdom and the juniors scoffed those two were engaged

The Senior Subaltern was so pleased with getting his Company and his
acceptance at the same time that he forgot to bother The Worm The girl
was a pretty girl and had money of her own She does not come into this
story at all

One night at the beginning of the hot weather all the Mess except The
Worm who had gone to his own room to write Home letters were sitting
on the platform outside the Mess House The Band had finished playing
but no one wanted to go in And the Captains wives were there also
The folly of a man in love is unlimited The Senior Subaltern had been
holding forth on the merits of the girl he was engaged to and the
ladies were purring approval while the men yawned when there was a
rustle of skirts in the dark and a tired faint voice lifted itself

Wheres my husband

I do not wish in the least to reflect on the morality of the
Shikarris but it is on record that four men jumped up as if they had
been shot Three of them were married men Perhaps they were afraid that
their wives had come from Home unbeknownst The fourth said that he had
acted on the impulse of the moment He explained this afterwards

Then the voice criedOh Lionel Lionel was the Senior Subalterns
name A woman came into the little circle of light by the candles on
the pegtables stretching out her hands to the dark where the Senior
Subaltern was and sobbing We rose to our feet feeling that things
were going to happen and ready to believe the worst In this bad small
world of ours one knows so little of the life of the next manwhich
after all is entirely his own concernthat one is not surprised when
a crash comes Anything might turn up any day for any one Perhaps the
Senior Subaltern had been trapped in his youth Men are crippled that
way occasionally We didnt know we wanted to hear and the Captains
wives were as anxious as we If he HAD been trapped he was to be
excused for the woman from nowhere in the dusty shoes and gray
travelling dress was very lovely with black hair and great eyes full
of tears She was tall with a fine figure and her voice had a running
sob in it pitiful to hear As soon as the Senior Subaltern stood up she
threw her arms round his neck and called him my darling and said she
could not bear waiting alone in England and his letters were so short
and cold and she was his to the end of the world and would he forgive
her This did not sound quite like a ladys way of speaking It was too
demonstrative

Things seemed black indeed and the Captains wives peered under their
eyebrows at the Senior Subaltern and the Colonels face set like the
Day of Judgment framed in gray bristles and no one spoke for a while

Next the Colonel said very shortlyWell Sir and the woman sobbed
afresh The Senior Subaltern was half choked with the arms round his
neck but he gasped outIts a dd lie I never had a wife in my
life Dont swear said the Colonel Come into the Mess We must
sift this clear somehow and he sighed to himself for he believed in
his Shikarris did the Colonel

We trooped into the anteroom under the full lights and there we
saw how beautiful the woman was She stood up in the middle of us all
sometimes choking with crying then hard and proud and then holding
out her arms to the Senior Subaltern It was like the fourth act of a
tragedy She told us how the Senior Subaltern had married her when he
was Home on leave eighteen months before and she seemed to know all
that we knew and more too of his people and his past life He was
white and ashy gray trying now and again to break into the torrent
of her words and we noting how lovely she was and what a criminal he
looked esteemed him a beast of the worst kind We felt sorry for him
though

I shall never forget the indictment of the Senior Subaltern by his wife
Nor will he It was so sudden rushing out of the dark unannounced
into our dull lives The Captains wives stood back but their eyes were
alight and you could see that they had already convicted and sentenced
the Senior Subaltern The Colonel seemed five years older One Major was
shading his eyes with his hand and watching the woman from underneath
it Another was chewing his moustache and smiling quietly as if he
were witnessing a play Full in the open space in the centre by the
whisttables the Senior Subalterns terrier was hunting for fleas I
remember all this as clearly as though a photograph were in my hand
I remember the look of horror on the Senior Subalterns face It was
rather like seeing a man hanged but much more interesting Finally the
woman wound up by saying that the Senior Subaltern carried a double F
M in tattoo on his left shoulder We all knew that and to our innocent
minds it seemed to clinch the matter But one of the Bachelor Majors
said very politelyI presume that your marriage certificate would be
more to the purpose

That roused the woman She stood up and sneered at the Senior Subaltern
for a cur and abused the Major and the Colonel and all the rest
Then she wept and then she pulled a paper from her breast saying
imperiallyTake that And let my husbandmy lawfully wedded
husbandread it aloudif he dare

There was a hush and the men looked into each others eyes as the
Senior Subaltern came forward in a dazed and dizzy way and took the
paper We were wondering as we stared whether there was anything
against any one of us that might turn up later on The Senior
Subalterns throat was dry but as he ran his eye over the paper he
broke out into a hoarse cackle of relief and said to the womanYou
young blackguard

But the woman had fled through a door and on the paper was
writtenThis is to certify that I The Worm have paid in full my
debts to the Senior Subaltern and further that the Senior Subaltern
is my debtor by agreement on the 23d of February as by the Mess
attested to the extent of one months Captains pay in the lawful
currency of the India Empire

Then a deputation set off for The Worms quarters and found him betwixt
and between unlacing his stays with the hat wig serge dress etc
on the bed He came over as he was and the Shikarris shouted till the
Gunners Mess sent over to know if they might have a share of the fun I
think we were all except the Colonel and the Senior Subaltern a little
disappointed that the scandal had come to nothing But that is human
nature There could be no two words about The Worms acting It leaned
as near to a nasty tragedy as anything this side of a joke can When
most of the Subalterns sat upon him with sofacushions to find out
why he had not said that acting was his strong point he answered very
quietlyI dont think you ever asked me I used to act at Home with
my sisters But no acting with girls could account for The Worms
display that night Personally I think it was in bad taste Besides
being dangerous There is no sort of use in playing with fire even for
fun

The Shikarris made him President of the Regimental Dramatic Club and
when the Senior Subaltern paid up his debt which he did at once The
Worm sank the money in scenery and dresses He was a good Worm and
the Shikarris are proud of him The only drawback is that he has been
christened Mrs Senior Subaltern and as there are now two Mrs Senior
Subalterns in the Station this is sometimes confusing to strangers

Later on I will tell you of a case something like this but with all
the jest left out and nothing in it but real trouble




THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED


 While the snaffle holds or the longneck stings
 While the big beam tilts or the last bell rings
 While horses are horses to train and to race
 Then women and wine take a second place
 For mefor me
 While a short tenthree
 Has a field to squander or fence to face

 Song of the G R


There are more ways of running a horse to suit your book than pulling
his head off in the straight Some men forget this Understand clearly
that all racing is rottenas everything connected with losing money
must be Out here in addition to its inherent rottenness it has the
merit of being twothirds sham looking pretty on paper only Every one
knows every one else far too well for business purposes How on earth
can you rack and harry and post a man for his losings when you are fond
of his wife and live in the same Station with him He says on the
Monday following I cant settle just yet You say All right old
man and think your self lucky if you pull off nine hundred out of
a twothousand rupee debt Any way you look at it Indian racing is
immoral and expensively immoral Which is much worse If a man wants
your money he ought to ask for it or send round a subscriptionlist
instead of juggling about the country with an Australian larrikin
a brumby with as much breed as the boy a brace of chumars in
goldlaced caps three or four ekkaponies with hogged manes and a
switchtailed demirep of a mare called Arab because she has a kink in
her flag Racing leads to the shroff quicker than anything else But
if you have no conscience and no sentiments and good hands and some
knowledge of pace and ten years experience of horses and several
thousand rupees a month I believe that you can occasionally contrive to
pay your shoeingbills

Did you ever know Shacklesb w g 15138coarse loose mulelike
earsbarrel as long as a gateposttough as a telegraphwireand the
queerest brute that ever looked through a bridle He was of no brand
being one of an earnicked mob taken into the Bucephalus at 4l10s a
head to make up freight and sold raw and out of condition at Calcutta
for Rs 275 People who lost money on him called him a brumby but if
ever any horse had Harpoons shoulders and The Gins temper Shackles
was that horse Two miles was his own particular distance He trained
himself ran himself and rode himself and if his jockey insulted
him by giving him hints he shut up at once and bucked the boy off He
objected to dictation Two or three of his owners did not understand
this and lost money in consequence At last he was bought by a man who
discovered that if a race was to be won Shackles and Shackles only
would win it in his own way so long as his jockey sat still This man
had a ridingboy called Brunta lad from Perth West Australiaand
he taught Brunt with a trainers whip the hardest thing a jock can
learnto sit still to sit still and to keep on sitting still When
Brunt fairly grasped this truth Shackles devastated the country No
weight could stop him at his own distance and the fame of Shackles
spread from Ajmir in the South to Chedputter in the North There was no
horse like Shackles so long as he was allowed to do his work in his own
way But he was beaten in the end and the story of his fall is enough
to make angels weep

At the lower end of the Chedputter racecourse just before the turn into
the straight the track passes close to a couple of old brickmounds
enclosing a funnelshaped hollow The big end of the funnel is not six
feet from the railings on the offside The astounding peculiarity of
the course is that if you stand at one particular place about half a
mile away inside the course and speak at an ordinary pitch your voice
just hits the funnel of the brickmounds and makes a curious whining
echo there A man discovered this one morning by accident while out
training with a friend He marked the place to stand and speak from
with a couple of bricks and he kept his knowledge to himself EVERY
peculiarity of a course is worth remembering in a country where rats
play the mischief with the elephantlitter and Stewards build jumps
to suit their own stables This man ran a very fairish countrybred a
long racking high mare with the temper of a fiend and the paces of
an airy wandering serapha drifty glidy stretch The mare was as a
delicate tribute to Mrs Reiver called The Lady Regula Baddunor for
short Regula Baddun

Shackles jockey Brunt was a quiet wellbehaved boy but his nerves
had been shaken He began his career by riding jumpraces in Melbourne
where a few Stewards want lynching and was one of the jockeys who
came through the awful butcheryperhaps you will recollect itof the
Maribyrnong Plate The walls were colonial rampartslogs of jarrak
spiked into masonrywith wings as strong as Church buttresses Once
in his stride a horse had to jump or fall He couldnt run out In the
Maribyrnong Plate twelve horses were jammed at the second wall Red
Hat leading fell this side and threw out The Glen and the ruck
came up behind and the space between wing and wing was one struggling
screaming kicking shambles Four jockeys were taken out dead three
were very badly hurt and Brunt was among the three He told the story
of the Maribyrnong Plate sometimes and when he described how Whalley
on Red Hat said as the mare fell under himGod ha mercy Im done
for and how next instant Sithee There and White Otter had crushed
the life out of poor Whalley and the dust hid a small hell of men and
horses no one marvelled that Brunt had dropped jumpraces and Australia
together Regula Badduns owner knew that story by heart Brunt never
varied it in the telling He had no education

Shackles came to the Chedputter Autumn races one year and his owner
walked about insulting the sportsmen of Chedputter generally till
they went to the Honorary Secretary in a body and saidAppoint
Handicappers and arrange a race which shall break Shackles and humble
the pride of his owner The Districts rose against Shackles and sent
up of their best Ousel who was supposed to be able to do his mile in
153 Petard the studbred trained by a cavalry regiment who knew how
to train Gringalet the ewelamb of the 75th Bobolink the pride of
Peshawar and many others

They called that race The BrokenLink Handicap because it was to smash
Shackles and the Handicappers piled on the weights and the Fund gave
eight hundred rupees and the distance was round the course for all
horses Shackles owner saidYou can arrange the race with regard
to Shackles only So long as you dont bury him under weightcloths
I dont mind Regula Badduns owner saidI throw in my mare to fret
Ousel Six furlongs is Regulas distance and she will then lie down
and die So also will Ousel for his jockey doesnt understand a waiting
race Now this was a lie for Regula had been in work for two months
at Dehra and her chances were good always supposing that Shackles
broke a bloodvesselOR BRUNT MOVED ON HIM

The plunging in the lotteries was fine They filled eight thousandrupee
lotteries on the Broken Link Handicap and the account in the Pioneer
said that favoritism was divided In plain English the various
contingents were wild on their respective horses for the Handicappers
had done their work well The Honorary Secretary shouted himself hoarse
through the din and the smoke of the cheroots was like the smoke and
the rattling of the diceboxes like the rattle of smallarm fire

Ten horses startedvery leveland Regula Badduns owner cantered out
on his back to a place inside the circle of the course where two bricks
had been thrown He faced towards the brickmounds at the lower end of
the course and waited

The story of the running is in the Pioneer At the end of the first
mile Shackles crept out of the ruck well on the outside ready to get
round the turn lay hold of the bit and spin up the straight before the
others knew he had got away Brunt was sitting still perfectly happy
listening to the drum drum drum of the hoofs behind and knowing
that in about twenty strides Shackles would draw one deep breath and
go up the last halfmile like the Flying Dutchman As Shackles went
short to take the turn and came abreast of the brickmound Brunt heard
above the noise of the wind in his ears a whining wailing voice on the
offside sayingGod ha mercy Im done for In one stride Brunt
saw the whole seething smash of the Maribyrnong Plate before him
started in his saddle and gave a yell of terror The start brought the
heels into Shackles side and the scream hurt Shackles feelings He
couldnt stop dead but he put out his feet and slid along for fifty
yards and then very gravely and judicially bucked off Brunta
shaking terrorstricken lump while Regula Baddun made a neckandneck
race with Bobolink up the straight and won by a short headPetard
a bad third Shackles owner in the Stand tried to think that his
fieldglasses had gone wrong Regula Badduns owner waiting by the two
bricks gave one deep sigh of relief and cantered back to the stand He
had won in lotteries and bets about fifteen thousand

It was a brokenlink Handicap with a vengeance It broke nearly all the
men concerned and nearly broke the heart of Shackles owner He went
down to interview Brunt The boy lay livid and gasping with fright
where he had tumbled off The sin of losing the race never seemed to
strike him All he knew was that Whalley had called him that the
call was a warning and were he cut in two for it he would never get
up again His nerve had gone altogether and he only asked his master
to give him a good thrashing and let him go He was fit for nothing he
said He got his dismissal and crept up to the paddock white as chalk
with blue lips his knees giving way under him People said nasty things
in the paddock but Brunt never heeded He changed into tweeds took his
stick and went down the road still shaking with fright and muttering
over and over againGod ha mercy Im done for To the best of my
knowledge and belief he spoke the truth

So now you know how the BrokenLink Handicap was run and won Of course
you dont believe it You would credit anything about Russias designs
on India or the recommendations of the Currency Commission but a
little bit of sober fact is more than you can stand




BEYOND THE PALE


 Love heeds not caste nor sleep a broken bed I went in search of
 love and lost myself

 Hindu Proverb


A man should whatever happens keep to his own caste race and breed
Let the White go to the White and the Black to the Black Then whatever
trouble falls is in the ordinary course of thingsneither sudden
alien nor unexpected

This is the story of a man who wilfully stepped beyond the safe limits
of decent everyday society and paid for it heavily

He knew too much in the first instance and he saw too much in the
second He took too deep an interest in native life but he will never
do so again

Deep away in the heart of the City behind Jitha Megjis bustee lies
Amir Naths Gully which ends in a deadwall pierced by one grated
window At the head of the Gully is a big cowbyre and the walls on
either side of the Gully are without windows Neither Suchet Singh nor
Gaur Chand approved of their womenfolk looking into the world If
Durga Charan had been of their opinion he would have been a happier man
today and little Biessa would have been able to knead her own bread
Her room looked out through the grated window into the narrow dark Gully
where the sun never came and where the buffaloes wallowed in the blue
slime She was a widow about fifteen years old and she prayed the
Gods day and night to send her a lover for she did not approve of
living alone

One day the manTrejago his name wascame into Amir Naths Gully on an
aimless wandering and after he had passed the buffaloes stumbled over
a big heap of cattle food

Then he saw that the Gully ended in a trap and heard a little laugh
from behind the grated window It was a pretty little laugh and
Trejago knowing that for all practical purposes the old Arabian
Nights are good guides went forward to the window and whispered that
verse of The Love Song of Har Dyal which begins


 Can a man stand upright in the face of the naked Sun
 or a Lover in the Presence of his Beloved
 If my feet fail me O Heart of my Heart am I to blame
 being blinded by the glimpse of your beauty


There came the faint tchinks of a womans bracelets from behind the
grating and a little voice went on with the song at the fifth verse


 Alas alas Can the Moon tell the Lotus of her love when the
 Gate of Heaven is shut and the clouds gather for the rains
 They have taken my Beloved and driven her with the packhorses
 to the North
 There are iron chains on the feet that were set on my heart
 Call to the bowman to make ready


The voice stopped suddenly and Trejago walked out of Amir Naths Gully
wondering who in the world could have capped The Love Song of Har Dyal
so neatly

Next morning as he was driving to the office an old woman threw a
packet into his dogcart In the packet was the half of a broken
glass bangle one flower of the blood red dhak a pinch of bhusa or
cattlefood and eleven cardamoms That packet was a letternot a
clumsy compromising letter but an innocent unintelligible lovers
epistle

Trejago knew far too much about these things as I have said No
Englishman should be able to translate objectletters But Trejago
spread all the trifles on the lid of his officebox and began to puzzle
them out

A broken glassbangle stands for a Hindu widow all India over because
when her husband dies a womans bracelets are broken on her wrists
Trejago saw the meaning of the little bit of the glass The flower
of the dhak means diversely desire come write or danger
according to the other things with it One cardamom means jealousy
but when any article is duplicated in an objectletter it loses its
symbolic meaning and stands merely for one of a number indicating time
or if incense curds or saffron be sent also place The message ran
thenA widow dhak flower and bhusaat eleven oclock The pinch of
bhusa enlightened Trejago He sawthis kind of letter leaves much
to instinctive knowledgethat the bhusa referred to the big heap of
cattlefood over which he had fallen in Amir Naths Gully and that the
message must come from the person behind the grating she being a widow
So the message ran thenA widow in the Gully in which is the heap of
bhusa desires you to come at eleven oclock

Trejago threw all the rubbish into the fireplace and laughed He knew
that men in the East do not make love under windows at eleven in the
forenoon nor do women fix appointments a week in advance So he went
that very night at eleven into Amir Naths Gully clad in a boorka
which cloaks a man as well as a woman Directly the gongs in the City
made the hour the little voice behind the grating took up The Love
Song of Har Dyal at the verse where the Panthan girl calls upon Har
Dyal to return The song is really pretty in the Vernacular In English
you miss the wail of it It runs something like this


 Alone upon the housetops to the North
 I turn and watch the lightning in the sky
 The glamour of thy footsteps in the North
 Come back to me Beloved or I die

 Below my feet the still bazar is laid
 Far far below the weary camels lie
 The camels and the captives of thy raid
 Come back to me Beloved or I die

 My fathers wife is old and harsh with years
 And drudge of all my fathers house am I
 My bread is sorrow and my drink is tears
 Come back to me Beloved or I die


As the song stopped Trejago stepped up under the grating and
whisperedI am here

Bisesa was good to look upon

That night was the beginning of many strange things and of a double
life so wild that Trejago today sometimes wonders if it were not all a
dream Bisesa or her old handmaiden who had thrown the objectletter had
detached the heavy grating from the brickwork of the wall so that the
window slid inside leaving only a square of raw masonry into which an
active man might climb

In the daytime Trejago drove through his routine of officework or
put on his callingclothes and called on the ladies of the Station
wondering how long they would know him if they knew of poor little
Bisesa At night when all the City was still came the walk under the
evilsmelling boorka the patrol through Jitha Megjis bustee the quick
turn into Amir Naths Gully between the sleeping cattle and the dead
walls and then last of all Bisesa and the deep even breathing of
the old woman who slept outside the door of the bare little room that
Durga Charan allotted to his sisters daughter Who or what Durga Charan
was Trejago never inquired and why in the world he was not discovered
and knifed never occurred to him till his madness was over and
Bisesa But this comes later

Bisesa was an endless delight to Trejago She was as ignorant as a bird
and her distorted versions of the rumors from the outside world that had
reached her in her room amused Trejago almost as much as her lisping
attempts to pronounce his nameChristopher The first syllable was
always more than she could manage and she made funny little gestures
with her roseleaf hands as one throwing the name away and then
kneeling before Trejago asked him exactly as an Englishwoman would do
if he were sure he loved her Trejago swore that he loved her more than
any one else in the world Which was true

After a month of this folly the exigencies of his other life compelled
Trejago to be especially attentive to a lady of his acquaintance You
may take it for a fact that anything of this kind is not only noticed
and discussed by a mans own race but by some hundred and fifty natives
as well Trejago had to walk with this lady and talk to her at the
Bandstand and once or twice to drive with her never for an instant
dreaming that this would affect his dearer outoftheway life But the
news flew in the usual mysterious fashion from mouth to mouth till
Bisesas duenna heard of it and told Bisesa The child was so troubled
that she did the household work evilly and was beaten by Durga Charans
wife in consequence

A week later Bisesa taxed Trejago with the flirtation She understood
no gradations and spoke openly Trejago laughed and Bisesa stamped her
little feetlittle feet light as marigold flowers that could lie in
the palm of a mans one hand

Much that is written about Oriental passion and impulsiveness is
exaggerated and compiled at secondhand but a little of it is true and
when an Englishman finds that little it is quite as startling as any
passion in his own proper life Bisesa raged and stormed and finally
threatened to kill herself if Trejago did not at once drop the alien
Memsahib who had come between them Trejago tried to explain and
to show her that she did not understand these things from a Western
standpoint Bisesa drew herself up and said simply

I do not I know only thisit is not good that I should have made you
dearer than my own heart to me Sahib You are an Englishman I am only
a black girlshe was fairer than bargold in the Mintand the widow
of a black man

Then she sobbed and said But on my soul and my Mothers soul I love
you There shall no harm come to you whatever happens to me

Trejago argued with the child and tried to soothe her but she seemed
quite unreasonably disturbed Nothing would satisfy her save that all
relations between them should end He was to go away at once And he
went As he dropped out at the window she kissed his forehead twice
and he walked away wondering

A week and then three weeks passed without a sign from Bisesa
Trejago thinking that the rupture had lasted quite long enough went
down to Amir Naths Gully for the fifth time in the three weeks hoping
that his rap at the sill of the shifting grating would be answered He
was not disappointed

There was a young moon and one stream of light fell down into Amir
Naths Gully and struck the grating which was drawn away as he
knocked From the black dark Bisesa held out her arms into the
moonlight Both hands had been cut off at the wrists and the stumps
were nearly healed

Then as Bisesa bowed her head between her arms and sobbed some one in
the room grunted like a wild beast and something sharpknife sword or
spearthrust at Trejago in his boorka The stroke missed his body but
cut into one of the muscles of the groin and he limped slightly from
the wound for the rest of his days

The grating went into its place There was no sign whatever from inside
the housenothing but the moonlight strip on the high wall and the
blackness of Amir Naths Gully behind

The next thing Trejago remembers after raging and shouting like a
madman between those pitiless walls is that he found himself near the
river as the dawn was breaking threw away his boorka and went home
bareheaded

What the tragedy waswhether Bisesa had in a fit of causeless despair
told everything or the intrigue had been discovered and she tortured
to tell whether Durga Charan knew his name and what became of
BisesaTrejago does not know to this day Something horrible had
happened and the thought of what it must have been comes upon Trejago
in the night now and again and keeps him company till the morning
One special feature of the case is that he does not know where lies the
front of Durga Charans house It may open on to a courtyard common to
two or more houses or it may lie behind any one of the gates of Jitha
Megjis bustee Trejago cannot tell He cannot get Bisesapoor little
Bisesaback again He has lost her in the City where each mans house
is as guarded and as unknowable as the grave and the grating that opens
into Amir Naths Gully has been walled up

But Trejago pays his calls regularly and is reckoned a very decent sort
of man

There is nothing peculiar about him except a slight stiffness caused
by a ridingstrain in the right leg




IN ERROR


 They burnt a corpse upon the sand
 The light shone out afar
 It guided home the plunging boats
 That beat from Zanzibar
 Spirit of Fire whereer Thy altars rise
 Thou art Light of Guidance to our eyes

 Salsette BoatSong


There is hope for a man who gets publicly and riotously drunk more
often that he ought to do but there is no hope for the man who drinks
secretly and alone in his own housethe man who is never seen to drink

This is a rule so there must be an exception to prove it Moriartys
case was that exception

He was a Civil Engineer and the Government very kindly put him quite
by himself in an outdistrict with nobody but natives to talk to and a
great deal of work to do He did his work well in the four years he
was utterly alone but he picked up the vice of secret and solitary
drinking and came up out of the wilderness more old and worn and
haggard than the deadalive life had any right to make him You know the
saying that a man who has been alone in the jungle for more than a
year is never quite sane all his life after People credited Moriartys
queerness of manner and moody ways to the solitude and said it showed
how Government spoilt the futures of its best men Moriarty had built
himself the plinth of a very good reputation in the bridgedamgirder
line But he knew every night of the week that he was taking steps
to undermine that reputation with L L L and Christopher and little
nips of liqueurs and filth of that kind He had a sound constitution
and a great brain or else he would have broken down and died like a
sick camel in the district as better men have done before him

Government ordered him to Simla after he had come out of the desert
and he went up meaning to try for a post then vacant That season Mrs
Reiverperhaps you will remember herwas in the height of her power
and many men lay under her yoke Everything bad that could be said
has already been said about Mrs Reiver in another tale Moriarty was
heavilybuilt and handsome very quiet and nervously anxious to please
his neighbors when he wasnt sunk in a brown study He started a good
deal at sudden noises or if spoken to without warning and when you
watched him drinking his glass of water at dinner you could see the
hand shake a little But all this was put down to nervousness and the
quiet steady sipsipsip fill and sipsipsip again that went
on in his own room when he was by himself was never known Which was
miraculous seeing how everything in a mans private life is public
property out here

Moriarty was drawn not into Mrs Reivers set because they were not
his sort but into the power of Mrs Reiver and he fell down in front
of her and made a goddess of her This was due to his coming fresh out
of the jungle to a big town He could not scale things properly or see
who was what

Because Mrs Reiver was cold and hard he said she was stately and
dignified Because she had no brains and could not talk cleverly he
said she was reserved and shy Mrs Reiver shy Because she was unworthy
of honor or reverence from any one he reverenced her from a distance
and dowered her with all the virtues in the Bible and most of those in
Shakespeare

This big dark abstracted man who was so nervous when a pony cantered
behind him used to moon in the train of Mrs Reiver blushing with
pleasure when she threw a word or two his way His admiration was
strictly platonic even other women saw and admitted this He did not
move out in Simla so he heard nothing against his idol which was
satisfactory Mrs Reiver took no special notice of him beyond seeing
that he was added to her list of admirers and going for a walk with him
now and then just to show that he was her property claimable as such
Moriarty must have done most of the talking for Mrs Reiver couldnt
talk much to a man of his stamp and the little she said could not have
been profitable What Moriarty believed in as he had good reason to
was Mrs Reivers influence over him and in that belief set himself
seriously to try to do away with the vice that only he himself knew of

His experiences while he was fighting with it must have been peculiar
but he never described them Sometimes he would hold off from everything
except water for a week Then on a rainy night when no one had asked
him out to dinner and there was a big fire in his room and everything
comfortable he would sit down and make a big night of it by adding
little nip to little nip planning big schemes of reformation meanwhile
until he threw himself on his bed hopelessly drunk He suffered next
morning

One night the big crash came He was troubled in his own mind over his
attempts to make himself worthy of the friendship of Mrs Reiver The
past ten days had been very bad ones and the end of it all was that he
received the arrears of two and threequarter years of sipping in one
attack of delirium tremens of the subdued kind beginning with suicidal
depression going on to fits and starts and hysteria and ending with
downright raving As he sat in a chair in front of the fire or walked
up and down the room picking a handkerchief to pieces you heard what
poor Moriarty really thought of Mrs Reiver for he raved about her
and his own fall for the most part though he ravelled some P W D
accounts into the same skein of thought He talked and talked and
talked in a low dry whisper to himself and there was no stopping him
He seemed to know that there was something wrong and twice tried to
pull himself together and confer rationally with the Doctor but his
mind ran out of control at once and he fell back to a whisper and the
story of his troubles It is terrible to hear a big man babbling like a
child of all that a man usually locks up and puts away in the deep of
his heart Moriarty read out his very soul for the benefit of any one
who was in the room between tenthirty that night and twofortyfive
next morning

From what he said one gathered how immense an influence Mrs Reiver
held over him and how thoroughly he felt for his own lapse His
whisperings cannot of course be put down here but they were very
instructive as showing the errors of his estimates

         

When the trouble was over and his few acquaintances were pitying him
for the bad attack of junglefever that had so pulled him down Moriarty
swore a big oath to himself and went abroad again with Mrs Reiver till
the end of the season adoring her in a quiet and deferential way as an
angel from heaven Later on he took to ridingnot hacking but honest
ridingwhich was good proof that he was improving and you could slam
doors behind him without his jumping to his feet with a gasp That
again was hopeful

How he kept his oath and what it cost him in the beginning nobody
knows He certainly managed to compass the hardest thing that a man who
has drank heavily can do He took his peg and wine at dinner but he
never drank alone and never let what he drank have the least hold on
him

Once he told a bosomfriend the story of his great trouble and how the
influence of a pure honest woman and an angel as well had saved him
When the manstartled at anything good being laid to Mrs Reivers
doorlaughed it cost him Moriartys friendship Moriarty who is
married now to a woman ten thousand times better than Mrs Reivera
woman who believes that there is no man on earth as good and clever as
her husbandwill go down to his grave vowing and protesting that Mrs
Reiver saved him from ruin in both worlds

That she knew anything of Moriartys weakness nobody believed for
a moment That she would have cut him dead thrown him over and
acquainted all her friends with her discovery if she had known of it
nobody who knew her doubted for an instant

Moriarty thought her something she never was and in that belief saved
himself Which was just as good as though she had been everything that
he had imagined

But the question is what claim will Mrs Reiver have to the credit of
Moriartys salvation when her day of reckoning comes




A BANK FRAUD


 He drank strong waters and his speech was coarse
 He purchased raiment and forebore to pay
 He struck a trusting junior with a horse
 And won Gymkhanas in a doubtful way
 Then twixt a vice and folly turned aside
 To do good deeds and straight to cloak them lied

 The Mess Room


If Reggie Burke were in India now he would resent this tale being told
but as he is in HongKong and wont see it the telling is safe He was
the man who worked the big fraud on the Sind and Sialkote Bank He was
manager of an upcountry Branch and a sound practical man with a large
experience of native loan and insurance work He could combine the
frivolities of ordinary life with his work and yet do well Reggie
Burke rode anything that would let him get up danced as neatly as he
rode and was wanted for every sort of amusement in the Station

As he said himself and as many men found out rather to their surprise
there were two Burkes both very much at your service Reggie Burke
between four and ten ready for anything from a hotweather gymkhana to
a ridingpicnic and between ten and four Mr Reginald Burke Manager
of the Sind and Sialkote Branch Bank You might play polo with him one
afternoon and hear him express his opinions when a man crossed and you
might call on him next morning to raise a twothousand rupee loan on a
five hundred pound insurancepolicy eighty pounds paid in premiums He
would recognize you but you would have some trouble in recognizing him

The Directors of the Bankit had its headquarters in Calcutta and its
General Managers word carried weight with the Governmentpicked their
men well They had tested Reggie up to a fairly severe breakingstrain
They trusted him just as much as Directors ever trust Managers You must
see for yourself whether their trust was misplaced

Reggies Branch was in a big Station and worked with the usual
staffone Manager one Accountant both English a Cashier and a horde
of native clerks besides the Police patrol at nights outside The
bulk of its work for it was in a thriving district was hoondi and
accommodation of all kinds A fool has no grip of this sort of business
and a clever man who does not go about among his clients and know
more than a little of their affairs is worse than a fool Reggie was
younglooking cleanshaved with a twinkle in his eye and a head
that nothing short of a gallon of the Gunners Madeira could make any
impression on

One day at a big dinner he announced casually that the Directors had
shifted on to him a Natural Curiosity from England in the Accountant
line He was perfectly correct Mr Silas Riley Accountant was a MOST
curious animala long gawky rawboned Yorkshireman full of the
savage selfconceit that blossoms only in the best county in England
Arrogance was a mild word for the mental attitude of Mr S Riley He
had worked himself up after seven years to a Cashiers position in a
Huddersfield Bank and all his experience lay among the factories of the
North Perhaps he would have done better on the Bombay side where they
are happy with onehalf per cent profits and money is cheap He was
useless for Upper India and a wheat Province where a man wants a large
head and a touch of imagination if he is to turn out a satisfactory
balancesheet

He was wonderfully narrowminded in business and being new to the
country had no notion that Indian banking is totally distinct from
Home work Like most clever selfmade men he had much simplicity in his
nature and somehow or other had construed the ordinarily polite terms
of his letter of engagement into a belief that the Directors had chosen
him on account of his special and brilliant talents and that they set
great store by him This notion grew and crystallized thus adding to
his natural Northcountry conceit Further he was delicate suffered
from some trouble in his chest and was short in his temper

You will admit that Reggie had reason to call his new Accountant a
Natural Curiosity The two men failed to hit it off at all Riley
considered Reggie a wild featherheaded idiot given to Heaven only
knew what dissipation in low places called Messes and totally unfit
for the serious and solemn vocation of banking He could never get
over Reggies look of youth and youbedamned air and he couldnt
understand Reggies friendscleanbuilt careless men in the Armywho
rode over to big Sunday breakfasts at the Bank and told sultry stories
till Riley got up and left the room Riley was always showing Reggie
how the business ought to be conducted and Reggie had more than once to
remind him that seven years limited experience between Huddersfield and
Beverly did not qualify a man to steer a big upcountry business Then
Riley sulked and referred to himself as a pillar of the Bank and a
cherished friend of the Directors and Reggie tore his hair If a mans
English subordinates fail him in this country he comes to a hard time
indeed for native help has strict limitations In the winter Riley went
sick for weeks at a time with his lung complaint and this threw more
work on Reggie But he preferred it to the everlasting friction when
Riley was well

One of the Travelling Inspectors of the Bank discovered these collapses
and reported them to the Directors Now Riley had been foisted on the
Bank by an M P who wanted the support of Rileys father who again
was anxious to get his son out to a warmer climate because of those
lungs The M P had an interest in the Bank but one of the Directors
wanted to advance a nominee of his own and after Rileys father had
died he made the rest of the Board see that an Accountant who was sick
for half the year had better give place to a healthy man If Riley had
known the real story of his appointment he might have behaved better
but knowing nothing his stretches of sickness alternated with restless
persistent meddling irritation of Reggie and all the hundred ways in
which conceit in a subordinate situation can find play Reggie used to
call him striking and haircurling names behind his back as a relief to
his own feelings but he never abused him to his face because he said
Riley is such a frail beast that half of his loathsome conceit is due
to pains in the chest

Late one April Riley went very sick indeed The doctor punched him
and thumped him and told him he would be better before long Then the
doctor went to Reggie and saidDo you know how sick your Accountant
is No said ReggieThe worse the better confound him Hes a
clacking nuisance when hes well Ill let you take away the Bank Safe
if you can drug him silent for this hotweather

But the doctor did not laughMan Im not joking he said Ill give
him another three months in his bed and a week or so more to die in
On my honor and reputation thats all the grace he has in this world
Consumption has hold of him to the marrow

Reggies face changed at once into the face of Mr Reginald Burke and
he answeredWhat can I do

Nothing said the doctor For all practical purposes the man is dead
already Keep him quiet and cheerful and tell him hes going to recover
Thats all Ill look after him to the end of course

The doctor went away and Reggie sat down to open the evening mail His
first letter was one from the Directors intimating for his information
that Mr Riley was to resign under a months notice by the terms of
his agreement telling Reggie that their letter to Riley would follow
and advising Reggie of the coming of a new Accountant a man whom Reggie
knew and liked

Reggie lit a cheroot and before he had finished smoking he had
sketched the outline of a fraud He put awayburkedthe Directors
letter and went in to talk to Riley who was as ungracious as usual
and fretting himself over the way the bank would run during his illness
He never thought of the extra work on Reggies shoulders but solely of
the damage to his own prospects of advancement Then Reggie assured him
that everything would be well and that he Reggie would confer with
Riley daily on the management of the Bank Riley was a little soothed
but he hinted in as many words that he did not think much of Reggies
business capacity Reggie was humble And he had letters in his desk
from the Directors that a Gilbarte or a Hardie might have been proud of

The days passed in the big darkened house and the Directors letter of
dismissal to Riley came and was put away by Reggie who every evening
brought the books to Rileys room and showed him what had been going
forward while Riley snarled Reggie did his best to make statements
pleasing to Riley but the Accountant was sure that the Bank was going
to rack and ruin without him In June as the lying in bed told on his
spirit he asked whether his absence had been noted by the Directors
and Reggie said that they had written most sympathetic letters hoping
that he would be able to resume his valuable services before long He
showed Riley the letters and Riley said that the Directors ought to
have written to him direct A few days later Reggie opened Rileys
mail in the halflight of the room and gave him the sheetnot the
envelopeof a letter to Riley from the Directors Riley said he would
thank Reggie not to interfere with his private papers specially as
Reggie knew he was too weak to open his own letters Reggie apologized

Then Rileys mood changed and he lectured Reggie on his evil ways
his horses and his bad friends Of course lying here on my back Mr
Burke I cant keep you straight but when Im well I DO hope youll
pay some heed to my words Reggie who had dropped polo and dinners
and tennis and all to attend to Riley said that he was penitent and
settled Rileys head on the pillow and heard him fret and contradict in
hard dry hacking whispers without a sign of impatience This at the
end of a heavy days office work doing double duty in the latter half
of June

When the new Accountant came Reggie told him the facts of the case and
announced to Riley that he had a guest staying with him Riley said that
he might have had more consideration than to entertain his doubtful
friends at such a time Reggie made Carron the new Accountant sleep
at the Club in consequence Carrons arrival took some of the heavy work
off his shoulders and he had time to attend to Rileys exactionsto
explain soothe invent and settle and resettle the poor wretch in
bed and to forge complimentary letters from Calcutta At the end of the
first month Riley wished to send some money home to his mother Reggie
sent the draft At the end of the second month Rileys salary came in
just the same Reggie paid it out of his own pocket and with it wrote
Riley a beautiful letter from the Directors

Riley was very ill indeed but the flame of his life burnt unsteadily
Now and then he would be cheerful and confident about the future
sketching plans for going Home and seeing his mother Reggie listened
patiently when the office work was over and encouraged him

At other times Riley insisted on Reggies reading the Bible and grim
Methody tracts to him Out of these tracts he pointed morals directed
at his Manager But he always found time to worry Reggie about the
working of the Bank and to show him where the weak points lay

This indoor sickroom life and constant strains wore Reggie down a
good deal and shook his nerves and lowered his billiardplay by forty
points But the business of the Bank and the business of the sickroom
had to go on though the glass was 116 degrees in the shade

At the end of the third month Riley was sinking fast and had begun
to realize that he was very sick But the conceit that made him worry
Reggie kept him from believing the worst He wants some sort of mental
stimulant if he is to drag on said the doctor Keep him interested in
life if you care about his living So Riley contrary to all the laws
of business and the finance received a 25percent rise of salary from
the Directors The mental stimulant succeeded beautifully Riley was
happy and cheerful and as is often the case in consumption healthiest
in mind when the body was weakest He lingered for a full month
snarling and fretting about the Bank talking of the future hearing the
Bible read lecturing Reggie on sin and wondering when he would be able
to move abroad

But at the end of September one mercilessly hot evening he rose up in
his bed with a little gasp and said quickly to ReggieMr Burke I
am going to die I know it in myself My chest is all hollow inside and
theres nothing to breathe with To the best of my knowledge I have done
nowthe was returning to the talk of his boyhoodto lie heavy on my
conscience God be thanked I have been preserved from the grosser forms
of sin and I counsel YOU Mr Burke

Here his voice died down and Reggie stooped over him

Send my salary for September to my mother done great things with
the Bank if I had been spared mistaken policy no fault of mine

Then he turned his face to the wall and died

Reggie drew the sheet over Its face and went out into the verandah
with his last mental stimulanta letter of condolence and sympathy
from the Directorsunused in his pocket

If Id been only ten minutes earlier thought Reggie I might have
heartened him up to pull through another day




TODS AMENDMENT


 The World hath set its heavy yoke
 Upon the old whitebearded folk
 Who strive to please the King
 Gods mercy is upon the young
 Gods wisdom in the baby tongue
 That fears not anything

 The Parable of Chajju Bhagat


Now Tods Mamma was a singularly charming woman and every one in Simla
knew Tods Most men had saved him from death on occasions He was beyond
his ayahs control altogether and perilled his life daily to find out
what would happen if you pulled a Mountain Battery mules tail He was
an utterly fearless young Pagan about six years old and the only baby
who ever broke the holy calm of the supreme Legislative Council

It happened this way Tods pet kid got loose and fled up the hill off
the Boileaugunge Road Tods after it until it burst into the Viceregal
Lodge lawn then attached to Peterhoff The Council were sitting at
the time and the windows were open because it was warm The Red Lancer
in the porch told Tods to go away but Tods knew the Red Lancer and most
of the Members of Council personally Moreover he had firm hold of the
kids collar and was being dragged all across the flowerbeds Give
my salaam to the long Councillor Sahib and ask him to help me take
Moti back gasped Tods The Council heard the noise through the open
windows and after an interval was seen the shocking spectacle of
a Legal Member and a LieutenantGovernor helping under the direct
patronage of a CommanderinChief and a Viceroy one small and very
dirty boy in a sailors suit and a tangle of brown hair to coerce a
lively and rebellious kid They headed it off down the path to the Mall
and Tods went home in triumph and told his Mamma that ALL the Councillor
Sahibs had been helping him to catch Moti Whereat his Mamma smacked
Tods for interfering with the administration of the Empire but Tods met
the Legal Member the next day and told him in confidence that if the
Legal Member ever wanted to catch a goat he Tods would give him all
the help in his power Thank you Tods said the Legal Member

Tods was the idol of some eighty jhampanis and half as many saises
He saluted them all as O Brother It never entered his head that
any living human being could disobey his orders and he was the
buffer between the servants and his Mammas wrath The working of that
household turned on Tods who was adored by every one from the dhoby
to the dogboy Even Futteh Khan the villainous loafer khit from
Mussoorie shirked risking Tods displeasure for fear his comates
should look down on him

So Tods had honor in the land from Boileaugunge to Chota Simla and
ruled justly according to his lights Of course he spoke Urdu but he
had also mastered many queer sidespeeches like the chotee bolee of the
women and held grave converse with shopkeepers and Hillcoolies alike
He was precocious for his age and his mixing with natives had taught
him some of the more bitter truths of life the meanness and the
sordidness of it He used over his bread and milk to deliver solemn
and serious aphorisms translated from the vernacular into the English
that made his Mamma jump and vow that Tods MUST go home next hot
weather

Just when Tods was in the bloom of his power the Supreme Legislature
were hacking out a Bill for the SubMontane Tracts a revision of the
then Act smaller than the Punjab Land Bill but affecting a few
hundred thousand people none the less The Legal Member had built
and bolstered and embroidered and amended that Bill till it looked
beautiful on paper Then the Council began to settle what they called
the minor details As if any Englishman legislating for natives knows
enough to know which are the minor and which are the major points from
the native point of view of any measure That Bill was a triumph of
safe guarding the interests of the tenant One clause provided that
land should not be leased on longer terms than five years at a stretch
because if the landlord had a tenant bound down for say twenty years
he would squeeze the very life out of him The notion was to keep up
a stream of independent cultivators in the SubMontane Tracts and
ethnologically and politically the notion was correct The only drawback
was that it was altogether wrong A natives life in India implies the
life of his son Wherefore you cannot legislate for one generation at
a time You must consider the next from the native point of view
Curiously enough the native now and then and in Northern India more
particularly hates being overprotected against himself There was
a Naga village once where they lived on dead AND buried Commissariat
mules But that is another story

For many reasons to be explained later the people concerned objected
to the Bill The Native Member in Council knew as much about Punjabis as
he knew about Charing Cross He had said in Calcutta that the Bill was
entirely in accord with the desires of that large and important class
the cultivators and so on and so on The Legal Members knowledge
of natives was limited to Englishspeaking Durbaris and his own red
chaprassis the SubMontane Tracts concerned no one in particular
the Deputy Commissioners were a good deal too driven to make
representations and the measure was one which dealt with small
landholders only Nevertheless the Legal Member prayed that it might be
correct for he was a nervously conscientious man He did not know that
no man can tell what natives think unless he mixes with them with the
varnish off And not always then But he did the best he knew And the
measure came up to the Supreme Council for the final touches while Tods
patrolled the Burra Simla Bazar in his morning rides and played with
the monkey belonging to Ditta Mull the bunnia and listened as a child
listens to all the stray talk about this new freak of the Lat Sahibs

One day there was a dinnerparty at the house of Tods Mamma and the
Legal Member came Tods was in bed but he kept awake till he heard the
bursts of laughter from the men over the coffee Then he paddled out in
his little red flannel dressinggown and his nightsuit and took refuge
by the side of his father knowing that he would not be sent back See
the miseries of having a family said Tods father giving Tods three
prunes some water in a glass that had been used for claret and telling
him to sit still Tods sucked the prunes slowly knowing that he would
have to go when they were finished and sipped the pink water like a man
of the world as he listened to the conversation Presently the Legal
Member talking shop to the Head of a Department mentioned his Bill
by its full nameThe SubMontane Tracts Ryotwari Revised Enactment
Tods caught the one native word and lifting up his small voice
saidOh I know ALL about that Has it been murramutted yet
Councillor Sahib

How much said the Legal Member

MurramuttedmendedPut theek you knowmade nice to please Ditta
Mull

The Legal Member left his place and moved up next to Tods

What do you know about Ryotwari little man he said

Im not a little man Im Tods and I know ALL about it Ditta Mull
and Choga Lall and Amir Nath andoh lakhs of my friends tell me
about it in the bazars when I talk to them

Oh they dodo they What do they say Tods

Tods tucked his feet under his red flannel dressinggown and saidI
must fink

The Legal Member waited patiently Then Tods with infinite compassion

You dont speak my talk do you Councillor Sahib

No I am sorry to say I do not said the Legal Member

Very well said Tods I must fink in English

He spent a minute putting his ideas in order and began very slowly
translating in his mind from the vernacular to English as many
AngloIndian children do You must remember that the Legal Member
helped him on by questions when he halted for Tods was not equal to the
sustained flight of oratory that follows

Ditta Mull saysThis thing is the talk of a child and was made up
by fools But I dont think you are a fool Councillor Sahib said
Todds hastily You caught my goat This is what Ditta Mull saysI
am not a fool and why should the Sirkar say I am a child I can see if
the land is good and if the landlord is good If I am a fool the sin is
upon my own head For five years I take my ground for which I have saved
money and a wife I take too and a little son is born Ditta Mull has
one daughter now but he SAYS he will have a son soon And he says At
the end of five years by this new bundobust I must go If I do not go
I must get fresh seals and takkusstamps on the papers perhaps in the
middle of the harvest and to go to the lawcourts once is wisdom but
to go twice is Jehannum That is QUITE true explained Tods gravely
All my friends say so And Ditta Mull saysAlways fresh takkus and
paying money to vakils and chaprassis and lawcourts every five years or
else the landlord makes me go Why do I want to go Am I fool If I am a
fool and do not know after forty years good land when I see it let
me die But if the new bundobust says for FIFTEEN years then it is
good and wise My little son is a man and I am burnt and he takes the
ground or another ground paying only once for the takkusstamps on the
papers and his little son is born and at the end of fifteen years is
a man too But what profit is there in five years and fresh papers
Nothing but dikh trouble dikh We are not young men who take these
lands but old onesnot jais but tradesmen with a little moneyand
for fifteen years we shall have peace Nor are we children that the
Sirkar should treat us so

Here Tods stopped short for the whole table were listening The Legal
Member said to Tods Is that all

All I can remember said Tods But you should see Ditta Mulls big
monkey Its just like a Councillor Sahib

Tods Go to bed said his father

Tods gathered up his dressinggown tail and departed

The Legal Member brought his hand down on the table with a crashBy
Jove said the Legal Member I believe the boy is right The short
tenure IS the weak point

He left early thinking over what Tods had said Now it was obviously
impossible for the Legal Member to play with a bunnias monkey by way
of getting understanding but he did better He made inquiries
always bearing in mind the fact that the real nativenot the hybrid
Universitytrained muleis as timid as a colt and little by little
he coaxed some of the men whom the measure concerned most intimately to
give in their views which squared very closely with Tods evidence

So the Bill was amended in that clause and the Legal Member was filled
with an uneasy suspicion that Native Members represent very little
except the Orders they carry on their bosoms But he put the thought
from him as illiberal He was a most Liberal Man

After a time the news spread through the bazars that Tods had got the
Bill recast in the tenure clause and if Tods Mamma had not interfered
Tods would have made himself sick on the baskets of fruit and pistachio
nuts and Cabuli grapes and almonds that crowded the verandah Till he
went Home Tods ranked some few degrees before the Viceroy in popular
estimation But for the little life of him Tods could not understand
why

In the Legal Members privatepaperbox still lies the rough draft of
the SubMontane Tracts Ryotwari Revised Enactment and opposite the
twentysecond clause pencilled in blue chalk and signed by the Legal
Member are the words Tods Amendment




IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH


 Stopped in the straight when the race was his own
 Look at him cutting itcur to the bone
 Ask ere the youngster be rated and chidden
 What did he carry and how was he ridden
 Maybe they used him too much at the start
 Maybe Fates weightcloths are breaking his heart

 Lifes Handicap


When I was telling you of the joke that The Worm played off on the
Senior Subaltern I promised a somewhat similar tale but with all the
jest left out This is that tale

Dicky Hatt was kidnapped in his early early youthneither by
landladys daughter housemaid barmaid nor cook but by a girl so
nearly of his own caste that only a woman could have said she was just
the least little bit in the world below it This happened a month
before he came out to India and five days after his oneandtwentieth
birthday The girl was nineteensix years older than Dicky in the
things of this world that is to sayand for the time twice as
foolish as he

Excepting always falling off a horse there is nothing more fatally
easy than marriage before the Registrar The ceremony costs less than
fifty shillings and is remarkably like walking into a pawnshop After
the declarations of residence have been put in four minutes will
cover the rest of the proceedingsfees attestation and all Then the
Registrar slides the blottingpad over the names and says grimly with
his pen between his teethNow youre man and wife and the couple
walk out into the street feeling as if something were horribly illegal
somewhere

But that ceremony holds and can drag a man to his undoing just
as thoroughly as the long as ye both shall live curse from the
altarrails with the bridesmaids giggling behind and The Voice that
breathed oer Eden lifting the roof off In this manner was Dicky Hatt
kidnapped and he considered it vastly fine for he had received an
appointment in India which carried a magnificent salary from the Home
point of view The marriage was to be kept secret for a year Then Mrs
Dicky Hatt was to come out and the rest of life was to be a glorious
golden mist That was how they sketched it under the Addison Road
Station lamps and after one short month came Gravesend and Dicky
steaming out to his new life and the girl crying in a thirtyshillings
a week bedandliving room in a back street off Montpelier Square near
the Knightsbridge Barracks

But the country that Dicky came to was a hard land where men of
twentyone were reckoned very small boys indeed and life was expensive
The salary that loomed so large six thousand miles away did not go far
Particularly when Dicky divided it by two and remitted more than the
fair half at 16 to Montpelier Square One hundred and thirtyfive
rupees out of three hundred and thirty is not much to live on but
it was absurd to suppose that Mrs Hatt could exist forever on the 20
pounds held back by Dicky from his outfit allowance Dicky saw this
and remitted at once always remembering that Rs 700 were to be paid
twelve months later for a firstclass passage out for a lady When you
add to these trifling details the natural instincts of a boy beginning a
new life in a new country and longing to go about and enjoy himself and
the necessity for grappling with strange workwhich properly speaking
should take up a boys undivided attentionyou will see that Dicky
started handicapped He saw it himself for a breath or two but he did
not guess the full beauty of his future

As the hot weather began the shackles settled on him and ate into his
flesh First would come lettersbig crossed seven sheet lettersfrom
his wife telling him how she longed to see him and what a Heaven
upon earth would be their property when they met Then some boy of the
chummery wherein Dicky lodged would pound on the door of his bare little
room and tell him to come out and look at a ponythe very thing to
suit him Dicky could not afford ponies He had to explain this Dicky
could not afford living in the chummery modest as it was He had to
explain this before he moved to a single room next the office where
he worked all day He kept house on a green oilcloth tablecover one
chair one charpoy one photograph one toothglass very strong and
thick a sevenrupee eightanna filter and messing by contract at
thirtyseven rupees a month Which last item was extortion He had no
punkah for a punkah costs fifteen rupees a month but he slept on the
roof of the office with all his wifes letters under his pillow Now and
again he was asked out to dinner where he got both a punkah and an iced
drink But this was seldom for people objected to recognizing a boy who
had evidently the instincts of a Scotch tallowchandler and who lived
in such a nasty fashion Dicky could not subscribe to any amusement so
he found no amusement except the pleasure of turning over his Bankbook
and reading what it said about loans on approved security That cost
nothing He remitted through a Bombay Bank by the way and the Station
knew nothing of his private affairs

Every month he sent Home all he could possibly spare for his wifeand
for another reason which was expected to explain itself shortly and
would require more money

About this time Dicky was overtaken with the nervous haunting fear
that besets married men when they are out of sorts He had no pension to
look to What if he should die suddenly and leave his wife unprovided
for The thought used to lay hold of him in the still hot nights on the
roof till the shaking of his heart made him think that he was going to
die then and there of heartdisease Now this is a frame of mind which
no boy has a right to know It is a strong mans trouble but coming
when it did it nearly drove poor punkahless perspiring Dicky Hatt
mad He could tell no one about it

A certain amount of screw is as necessary for a man as for a
billiardball It makes them both do wonderful things Dicky needed
money badly and he worked for it like a horse But naturally the men
who owned him knew that a boy can live very comfortably on a certain
incomepay in India is a matter of age not merit you see and if
their particular boy wished to work like two boys Business forbid that
they should stop him But Business forbid that they should give him an
increase of pay at his present ridiculously immature age So Dicky won
certain rises of salaryample for a boynot enough for a wife and
childcertainly too little for the sevenhundredrupee passage that he
and Mrs Hatt had discussed so lightly once upon a time And with this
he was forced to be content

Somehow all his money seemed to fade away in Home drafts and the
crushing Exchange and the tone of the Home letters changed and grew
querulous Why wouldnt Dicky have his wife and the baby out Surely he
had a salarya fine salaryand it was too bad of him to enjoy himself
in India But would hecould hemake the next draft a little more
elastic Here followed a list of babys kit as long as a Parsees
bill Then Dicky whose heart yearned to his wife and the little son
he had never seenwhich again is a feeling no boy is entitled
toenlarged the draft and wrote queer halfboy halfman letters
saying that life was not so enjoyable after all and would the little
wife wait yet a little longer But the little wife however much she
approved of money objected to waiting and there was a strange hard
sort of ring in her letters that Dicky didnt understand How could he
poor boy

Later on stilljust as Dicky had been toldapropos of another
youngster who had made a fool of himself as the saying isthat
matrimony would not only ruin his further chances of advancement but
would lose him his present appointmentcame the news that the baby his
own little little son had died and behind this forty lines of
an angry womans scrawl saying that death might have been averted if
certain things all costing money had been done or if the mother and
the baby had been with Dicky The letter struck at Dickys naked heart
but not being officially entitled to a baby he could show no sign of
trouble

How Dicky won through the next four months and what hope he kept
alight to force him into his work no one dare say He pounded on the
sevenhundredrupee passage as far away as ever and his style of living
unchanged except when he launched into a new filter There was the
strain of his officework and the strain of his remittances and the
knowledge of his boys death which touched the boy more perhaps than
it would have touched a man and beyond all the enduring strain of
his daily life Grayheaded seniors who approved of his thrift and his
fashion of denying himself everything pleasant reminded him of the old
saw that says


 If a youth would be distinguished in his art art art
 He must keep the girls away from his heart heart heart


And Dicky who fancied he had been through every trouble that a man is
permitted to know had to laugh and agree with the last line of his
balanced Bankbook jingling in his head day and night

But he had one more sorrow to digest before the end There arrived a
letter from the little wifethe natural sequence of the others if
Dicky had only known itand the burden of that letter was gone with
a handsomer man than you It was a rather curious production without
stops something like thisShe was not going to wait forever and the
baby was dead and Dicky was only a boy and he would never set eyes on
her again and why hadnt he waved his handkerchief to her when he left
Gravesend and God was her judge she was a wicked woman but Dicky was
worse enjoying himself in India and this other man loved the ground she
trod on and would Dicky ever forgive her for she would never forgive
Dicky and there was no address to write to

Instead of thanking his lucky stars that he was free Dicky discovered
exactly how an injured husband feelsagain not at all the knowledge
to which a boy is entitledfor his mind went back to his wife as he
remembered her in the thirtyshilling suite in Montpelier Square when
the dawn of his last morning in England was breaking and she was crying
in the bed Whereat he rolled about on his bed and bit his fingers He
never stopped to think whether if he had met Mrs Hatt after those
two years he would have discovered that he and she had grown quite
different and new persons This theoretically he ought to have done
He spent the night after the English Mail came in rather severe pain

Next morning Dicky Hatt felt disinclined to work He argued that he had
missed the pleasure of youth He was tired and he had tasted all the
sorrow in life before threeandtwenty His Honor was gonethat was the
man and now he too would go to the Devilthat was the boy in him So
he put his head down on the green oilcloth tablecover and wept before
resigning his post and all it offered

But the reward of his services came He was given three days to
reconsider himself and the Head of the establishment after some
telegraphings said that it was a most unusual step but in view of the
ability that Mr Hatt had displayed at such and such a time at such and
such junctures he was in a position to offer him an infinitely superior
postfirst on probation and later in the natural course of things
on confirmation And how much does the post carry said Dicky Six
hundred and fifty rupees said the Head slowly expecting to see the
young man sink with gratitude and joy

And it came then The seven hundred rupee passage and enough to have
saved the wife and the little son and to have allowed of assured and
open marriage came then Dicky burst into a roar of laughterlaughter
he could not checknasty jangling merriment that seemed as if it
would go on forever When he had recovered himself he said quite
seriouslyIm tired of work Im an old man now Its about time I
retired And I will

The boys mad said the Head

I think he was right but Dicky Hatt never reappeared to settle the
question




PIG


 Go stalk the red deer oer the heather
 Ride follow the fox if you can
 But for pleasure and profit together
 Allow me the hunting of Man
 The chase of the Human the search for the Soul
 To its ruinthe hunting of Man

 The Old Shikarri


I believe the difference began in the matter of a horse with a twist in
his temper whom Pinecoffin sold to Nafferton and by whom Nafferton was
nearly slain There may have been other causes of offence the horse was
the official stalkinghorse Nafferton was very angry but Pinecoffin
laughed and said that he had never guaranteed the beasts manners
Nafferton laughed too though he vowed that he would write off his fall
against Pinecoffin if he waited five years Now a Dalesman from beyond
Skipton will forgive an injury when the Strid lets a man live but a
South Devon man is as soft as a Dartmoor bog You can see from their
names that Nafferton had the raceadvantage of Pinecoffin He was a
peculiar man and his notions of humor were cruel He taught me a new
and fascinating form of shikar He hounded Pinecoffin from Mithankot
to Jagadri and from Gurgaon to Abbottabad up and across the Punjab
a large province and in places remarkably dry He said that he had no
intention of allowing Assistant Commissioners to sell him pups in the
shape of ramping screaming countrybreds without making their lives a
burden to them

Most Assistant Commissioners develop a bent for some special work after
their first hot weather in the country The boys with digestions hope to
write their names large on the Frontier and struggle for dreary places
like Bannu and Kohat The bilious ones climb into the Secretariat Which
is very bad for the liver Others are bitten with a mania for District
work Ghuznivide coins or Persian poetry while some who come of
farmers stock find that the smell of the Earth after the Rains gets
into their blood and calls them to develop the resources of the
Province These men are enthusiasts Pinecoffin belonged to their
class He knew a great many facts bearing on the cost of bullocks and
temporary wells and opiumscrapers and what happens if you burn too
much rubbish on a field in the hope of enriching usedup soil All the
Pinecoffins come of a landholding breed and so the land only took back
her own again Unfortunatelymost unfortunately for Pinecoffinhe
was a Civilian as well as a farmer Nafferton watched him and thought
about the horse Nafferton saidSee me chase that boy till he drops
I saidYou cant get your knife into an Assistant Commissioner
Nafferton told me that I did not understand the administration of the
Province

Our Government is rather peculiar It gushes on the agricultural and
general information side and will supply a moderately respectable man
with all sorts of economic statistics if he speaks to it prettily
For instance you are interested in goldwashing in the sands of the
Sutlej You pull the string and find that it wakes up half a dozen
Departments and finally communicates say with a friend of yours
in the Telegraph who once wrote some notes on the customs of the
goldwashers when he was on constructionwork in their part of the
Empire He may or may not be pleased at being ordered to write out
everything he knows for your benefit This depends on his temperament
The bigger man you are the more information and the greater trouble can
you raise

Nafferton was not a big man but he had the reputation of being very
earnest An earnest man can do much with a Government There was an
earnest man who once nearly wrecked but all India knows THAT story
I am not sure what real earnestness is A very fair imitation can
be manufactured by neglecting to dress decently by mooning about in a
dreamy misty sort of way by taking officework home after staying
in office till seven and by receiving crowds of native gentlemen on
Sundays That is one sort of earnestness

Nafferton cast about for a peg whereon to hang his earnestness and for
a string that would communicate with Pinecoffin He found both They
were Pig Nafferton became an earnest inquirer after Pig He informed
the Government that he had a scheme whereby a very large percentage of
the British Army in India could be fed at a very large saving on
Pig Then he hinted that Pinecoffin might supply him with the varied
information necessary to the proper inception of the scheme So the
Government wrote on the back of the letterInstruct Mr Pinecoffin to
furnish Mr Nafferton with any information in his power Government is
very prone to writing things on the backs of letters which later lead
to trouble and confusion

Nafferton had not the faintest interest in Pig but he knew that
Pinecoffin would flounce into the trap Pinecoffin was delighted at
being consulted about Pig The Indian Pig is not exactly an important
factor in agricultural life but Nafferton explained to Pinecoffin that
there was room for improvement and corresponded direct with that young
man

You may think that there is not much to be evolved from Pig It all
depends how you set to work Pinecoffin being a Civilian and wishing
to do things thoroughly began with an essay on the Primitive Pig
the Mythology of the Pig and the Dravidian Pig Nafferton filed that
informationtwentyseven foolscap sheetsand wanted to know about the
distribution of the Pig in the Punjab and how it stood the Plains in
the hot weather From this point onwards remember that I am giving you
only the barest outlines of the affairthe guyropes as it were of
the web that Nafferton spun round Pinecoffin

Pinecoffin made a colored Pigpopulation map and collected observations
on the comparative longevity of the Pig a in the submontane tracts
of the Himalayas and b in the Rechna Doab Nafferton filed that and
asked what sort of people looked after Pig This started an ethnological
excursus on swineherds and drew from Pinecoffin long tables showing
the proportion per thousand of the caste in the Derajat Nafferton filed
that bundle and explained that the figures which he wanted referred to
the CisSutlej states where he understood that Pigs were very fine
and large and where he proposed to start a Piggery By this time
Government had quite forgotten their instructions to Mr Pinecoffin
They were like the gentlemen in Keats poem who turned welloiled
wheels to skin other people But Pinecoffin was just entering into the
spirit of the Pighunt as Nafferton well knew he would do He had a
fair amount of work of his own to clear away but he sat up of nights
reducing Pig to five places of decimals for the honor of his Service He
was not going to appear ignorant of so easy a subject as Pig

Then Government sent him on special duty to Kohat to inquire into
the bigsevenfoot ironshod spades of that District People had been
killing each other with those peaceful tools and Government wished
to know whether a modified form of agricultural implement could
not tentatively and as a temporary measure be introduced among the
agricultural population without needlessly or unduly exasperating the
existing religious sentiments of the peasantry

Between those spades and Naffertons Pig Pinecoffin was rather heavily
burdened

Nafferton now began to take up a The foodsupply of the indigenous
Pig with a view to the improvement of its capacities as a fleshformer
b The acclimatization of the exotic Pig maintaining its distinctive
peculiarities Pinecoffin replied exhaustively that the exotic Pig
would become merged in the indigenous type and quoted horsebreeding
statistics to prove this The sideissue was debated at great length on
Pinecoffins side till Nafferton owned that he had been in the wrong
and moved the previous question When Pinecoffin had quite written
himself out about fleshformers and fibrins and glucose and the
nitrogenous constituents of maize and lucerne Nafferton raised the
question of expense By this time Pinecoffin who had been transferred
from Kohat had developed a Pig theory of his own which he stated in
thirtythree folio pagesall carefully filed by Nafferton Who asked
for more

These things took ten months and Pinecoffins interest in the potential
Piggery seemed to die down after he had stated his own views But
Nafferton bombarded him with letters on the Imperial aspect of
the scheme as tending to officialize the sale of pork and thereby
calculated to give offence to the Mahomedan population of Upper India
He guessed that Pinecoffin would want some broad freehand work after
his niggling stippling decimal details Pinecoffin handled the latest
development of the case in masterly style and proved that no popular
ebullition of excitement was to be apprehended Nafferton said that
there was nothing like Civilian insight in matters of this kind
and lured him up a byepaththe possible profits to accrue to the
Government from the sale of hogbristles There is an extensive
literature of hogbristles and the shoe brush and colormans trades
recognize more varieties of bristles than you would think possible
After Pinecoffin had wondered a little at Naffertons rage for
information he sent back a monograph fiftyone pages on Products of
the Pig This led him under Naffertons tender handling straight to
the Cawnpore factories the trade in hogskin for saddlesand thence
to the tanners Pinecoffin wrote that pomegranateseed was the best cure
for hogskin and suggestedfor the past fourteen months had wearied
himthat Nafferton should raise his pigs before he tanned them

Nafferton went back to the second section of his fifth question How
could the exotic Pig be brought to give as much pork as it did in the
West and yet assume the essentially hirsute characteristics of its
oriental congener Pinecoffin felt dazed for he had forgotten what
he had written sixteen months before and fancied that he was about
to reopen the entire question He was too far involved in the hideous
tangle to retreat and in a weak moment he wroteConsult my first
letter Which related to the Dravidian Pig As a matter of fact
Pinecoffin had still to reach the acclimatization stage having gone off
on a sideissue on the merging of types

THEN Nafferton really unmasked his batteries He complained to the
Government in stately language of the paucity of help accorded to me
in my earnest attempts to start a potentially remunerative industry and
the flippancy with which my requests for information are treated by a
gentleman whose pseudoscholarly attainments should at lest have taught
him the primary differences between the Dravidian and the Berkshire
variety of the genus Sus If I am to understand that the letter to which
he refers me contains his serious views on the acclimatization of a
valuable though possibly uncleanly animal I am reluctantly compelled
to believe etc etc

There was a new man at the head of the Department of Castigation The
wretched Pinecoffin was told that the Service was made for the Country
and not the Country for the Service and that he had better begin to
supply information about Pigs

Pinecoffin answered insanely that he had written everything that could
be written about Pig and that some furlough was due to him

Nafferton got a copy of that letter and sent it with the essay on the
Dravidian Pig to a downcountry paper which printed both in full The
essay was rather highflown but if the Editor had seen the stacks of
paper in Pinecoffins handwriting on Naffertons table he would not
have been so sarcastic about the nebulous discursiveness and blatant
selfsufficiency of the modern Competitionwallah and his utter
inability to grasp the practical issues of a practical question Many
friends cut out these remarks and sent them to Pinecoffin

I have already stated that Pinecoffin came of a soft stock This last
stroke frightened and shook him He could not understand it but he felt
he had been somehow shamelessly betrayed by Nafferton He realized
that he had wrapped himself up in the Pigskin without need and that
he could not well set himself right with his Government All his
acquaintances asked after his nebulous discursiveness or his blatant
selfsufficiency and this made him miserable

He took a train and went to Nafferton whom he had not seen since
the Pig business began He also took the cutting from the paper and
blustered feebly and called Nafferton names and then died down to a
watery weak protest of the Isayitstoobadyouknow order

Nafferton was very sympathetic

Im afraid Ive given you a good deal of trouble havent I said he

Trouble whimpered Pinecoffin I dont mind the trouble so much
though that was bad enough but what I resent is this showing up in
print It will stick to me like a burr all through my service And I DID
do my best for your interminable swine Its too bad of you on my soul
it is

I dont know said Nafferton have you ever been stuck with a horse
It isnt the money I mind though that is bad enough but what I resent
is the chaff that follows especially from the boy who stuck me But I
think well cry quits now

Pinecoffin found nothing to say save bad words and Nafferton smiled
ever so sweetly and asked him to dinner




THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS


 It was not in the open fight
 We threw away the sword
 But in the lonely watching
 In the darkness by the ford
 The waters lapped the nightwind blew
 Fullarmed the Fear was born and grew
 And we were flying ere we knew
 From panic in the night

 Beoni Bar


Some people hold that an English Cavalry regiment cannot run This is
a mistake I have seen four hundred and thirtyseven sabres flying over
the face of the country in abject terrorhave seen the best Regiment
that ever drew bridle wiped off the Army List for the space of two
hours If you repeat this tale to the White Hussars they will in all
probability treat you severely They are not proud of the incident

You may know the White Hussars by their side which is greater than
that of all the Cavalry Regiments on the roster If this is not a
sufficient mark you may know them by their old brandy It has been
sixty years in the Mess and is worth going far to taste Ask for the
McGaire old brandy and see that you get it If the Mess Sergeant
thinks that you are uneducated and that the genuine article will be
lost on you he will treat you accordingly He is a good man But when
you are at Mess you must never talk to your hosts about forced marches
or longdistance rides The Mess are very sensitive and if they think
that you are laughing at them will tell you so

As the White Hussars say it was all the Colonels fault He was a new
man and he ought never to have taken the Command He said that the
Regiment was not smart enough This to the White Hussars who knew they
could walk round any Horse and through any Guns and over any Foot on
the face of the earth That insult was the first cause of offence

Then the Colonel cast the DrumHorsethe DrumHorse of the White
Hussars Perhaps you do not see what an unspeakable crime he had
committed I will try to make it clear The soul of the Regiment lives
in the DrumHorse who carries the silver kettledrums He is nearly
always a big piebald Waler That is a point of honor and a Regiment
will spend anything you please on a piebald He is beyond the ordinary
laws of casting His work is very light and he only manoeuvres at a
footpace Wherefore so long as he can step out and look handsome
his wellbeing is assured He knows more about the Regiment than the
Adjutant and could not make a mistake if he tried

The DrumHorse of the White Hussars was only eighteen years old and
perfectly equal to his duties He had at least six years more work in
him and carried himself with all the pomp and dignity of a DrumMajor
of the Guards The Regiment had paid Rs 1200 for him

But the Colonel said that he must go and he was cast in due form and
replaced by a washy bay beast as ugly as a mule with a eweneck
rattail and cowhocks The Drummer detested that animal and the best
of the Bandhorses put back their ears and showed the whites of their
eyes at the very sight of him They knew him for an upstart and no
gentleman I fancy that the Colonels ideas of smartness extended to
the Band and that he wanted to make it take part in the regular parade
movements A Cavalry Band is a sacred thing It only turns out for
Commanding Officers parades and the Band Master is one degree more
important than the Colonel He is a High Priest and the Keel Row is
his holy song The Keel Row is the Cavalry Trot and the man who has
never heard that tune rising high and shrill above the rattle of the
Regiment going past the salutingbase has something yet to hear and
understand

When the Colonel cast the Drumhorse of the White Hussars there was
nearly a mutiny

The officers were angry the Regiment were furious and the Bandsman
sworelike troopers The DrumHorse was going to be put up to
auctionpublic auctionto be bought perhaps by a Parsee and put into
a cart It was worse than exposing the inner life of the Regiment to the
whole world or selling the Mess Plate to a Jewa black Jew

The Colonel was a mean man and a bully He knew what the Regiment
thought about his action and when the troopers offered to buy the
DrumHorse he said that their offer was mutinous and forbidden by the
Regulations

But one of the SubalternsHoganYale an Irishmanbought the
DrumHorse for Rs 160 at the sale and the Colonel was wroth Yale
professed repentancehe was unnaturally submissiveand said that
as he had only made the purchase to save the horse from possible
illtreatment and starvation he would now shoot him and end the
business This appeared to soothe the Colonel for he wanted the
DrumHorse disposed of He felt that he had made a mistake and could
not of course acknowledge it Meantime the presence of the DrumHorse
was an annoyance to him

Yale took to himself a glass of the old brandy three cheroots and his
friend Martyn and they all left the Mess together Yale and Martyn
conferred for two hours in Yales quarters but only the bullterrier
who keeps watch over Yales boottrees knows what they said A horse
hooded and sheeted to his ears left Yales stables and was taken very
unwillingly into the Civil Lines Yales groom went with him Two men
broke into the Regimental Theatre and took several paintpots and some
large scenery brushes Then night fell over the Cantonments and there
was a noise as of a horse kicking his loosebox to pieces in Yales
stables Yale had a big old white Waler traphorse

The next day was a Thursday and the men hearing that Yale was going
to shoot the DrumHorse in the evening determined to give the beast a
regular regimental funerala finer one than they would have given the
Colonel had he died just then They got a bullockcart and some sacking
and mounds and mounds of roses and the body under sacking was carried
out to the place where the anthrax cases were cremated twothirds of
the Regiment followed There was no Band but they all sang The Place
where the old Horse died as something respectful and appropriate to the
occasion When the corpse was dumped into the grave and the men began
throwing down armfuls of roses to cover it the FarrierSergeant ripped
out an oath and said aloudWhy it aint the DrumHorse any more than
its me The TroopSergeantMajors asked him whether he had left
his head in the Canteen The FarrierSergeant said that he knew the
DrumHorses feet as well as he knew his own but he was silenced
when he saw the regimental number burnt in on the poor stiff upturned
nearfore

Thus was the DrumHorse of the White Hussars buried the
FarrierSergeant grumbling The sacking that covered the corpse was
smeared in places with black paint and the FarrierSergeant drew
attention to this fact But the TroopSergeantMajor of E Troop kicked
him severely on the shin and told him that he was undoubtedly drunk

On the Monday following the burial the Colonel sought revenge on the
White Hussars Unfortunately being at that time temporarily in Command
of the Station he ordered a Brigade fieldday He said that he wished
to make the regiment sweat for their damned insolence and he carried
out his notion thoroughly That Monday was one of the hardest days
in the memory of the White Hussars They were thrown against a
skeletonenemy and pushed forward and withdrawn and dismounted and
scientifically handled in every possible fashion over dusty country
till they sweated profusely Their only amusement came late in the day
when they fell upon the battery of Horse Artillery and chased it for two
miles This was a personal question and most of the troopers had money
on the event the Gunners saying openly that they had the legs of the
White Hussars They were wrong A marchpast concluded the campaign and
when the Regiment got back to their Lines the men were coated with dirt
from spur to chinstrap

The White Hussars have one great and peculiar privilege They won it at
Fontenoy I think

Many Regiments possess special rights such as wearing collars with
undress uniform or a bow of ribbon between the shoulders or red and
white roses in their helmets on certain days of the year Some
rights are connected with regimental saints and some with regimental
successes All are valued highly but none so highly as the right of
the White Hussars to have the Band playing when their horses are being
watered in the Lines Only one tune is played and that tune never
varies I dont know its real name but the White Hussars call
itTake me to London again It sounds very pretty The Regiment
would sooner be struck off the roster than forego their distinction

After the dismiss was sounded the officers rode off home to prepare
for stables and the men filed into the lines riding easy That is to
say they opened their tight buttons shifted their helmets and began
to joke or to swear as the humor took them the more careful slipping
off and easing girths and curbs A good trooper values his mount exactly
as much as he values himself and believes or should believe that the
two together are irresistible where women or men girls or guns are
concerned

Then the OrderlyOfficer gave the orderWater horses and the
Regiment loafed off to the squadrontroughs which were in rear of
the stables and between these and the barracks There were four huge
troughs one for each squadron arranged en echelon so that the whole
Regiment could water in ten minutes if it liked But it lingered for
seventeen as a rule while the Band played

The band struck up as the squadrons filed off the troughs and the men
slipped their feet out of the stirrups and chaffed each other The sun
was just setting in a big hot bed of red cloud and the road to the
Civil Lines seemed to run straight into the suns eye There was a
little dot on the road It grew and grew till it showed as a horse with
a sort of gridiron thing on his back The red cloud glared through the
bars of the gridiron Some of the troopers shaded their eyes with their
hands and saidWhat the mischief as that there orse got on im

In another minute they heard a neigh that every soulhorse and manin
the Regiment knew and saw heading straight towards the Band the dead
DrumHorse of the White Hussars

On his withers banged and bumped the kettledrums draped in crape and
on his back very stiff and soldierly sat a bareheaded skeleton

The band stopped playing and for a moment there was a hush

Then some one in E troopmen said it was the
TroopSergeantMajorswung his horse round and yelled No one can
account exactly for what happened afterwards but it seems that at
least one man in each troop set an example of panic and the rest
followed like sheep The horses that had barely put their muzzles into
the troughs reared and capered but as soon as the Band broke which
it did when the ghost of the DrumHorse was about a furlong distant all
hooves followed suit and the clatter of the stampedequite different
from the orderly throb and roar of a movement on parade or the rough
horseplay of watering in campmade them only more terrified They felt
that the men on their backs were afraid of something When horses once
know THAT all is over except the butchery

Troop after troop turned from the troughs and rananywhere and
everywherelike spit quicksilver It was a most extraordinary
spectacle for men and horses were in all stages of easiness and the
carbinebuckets flopping against their sides urged the horses on Men
were shouting and cursing and trying to pull clear of the Band which
was being chased by the DrumHorse whose rider had fallen forward and
seemed to be spurring for a wager

The Colonel had gone over to the Mess for a drink Most of the officers
were with him and the Subaltern of the Day was preparing to go down
to the lines and receive the watering reports from the TroopSergeant
Majors When Take me to London again stopped after twenty bars every
one in the Mess saidWhat on earth has happened A minute later
they heard unmilitary noises and saw far across the plain the White
Hussars scattered and broken and flying

The Colonel was speechless with rage for he thought that the Regiment
had risen against him or was unanimously drunk The Band a disorganized
mob tore past and at its heels labored the DrumHorsethe dead and
buried DrumHorsewith the jolting clattering skeleton HoganYale
whispered softly to MartynNo wire will stand that treatment and
the Band which had doubled like a hare came back again But the rest
of the Regiment was gone was rioting all over the Province for the
dusk had shut in and each man was howling to his neighbor that the
DrumHorse was on his flank TroopHorses are far too tenderly treated
as a rule They can on emergencies do a great deal even with
seventeen stone on their backs As the troopers found out

How long this panic lasted I cannot say I believe that when the moon
rose the men saw they had nothing to fear and by twos and threes
and halftroops crept back into Cantonments very much ashamed of
themselves Meantime the DrumHorse disgusted at his treatment by
old friends pulled up wheeled round and trotted up to the Mess
verandahsteps for bread No one liked to run but no one cared to go
forward till the Colonel made a movement and laid hold of the skeletons
foot The Band had halted some distance away and now came back slowly
The Colonel called it individually and collectively every evil name
that occurred to him at the time for he had set his hand on the
bosom of the DrumHorse and found flesh and blood Then he beat the
kettledrums with his clenched fist and discovered that they were but
made of silvered paper and bamboo Next still swearing he tried to
drag the skeleton out of the saddle but found that it had been wired
into the cantle The sight of the Colonel with his arms round the
skeletons pelvis and his knee in the old DrumHorses stomach was
striking Not to say amusing He worried the thing off in a minute or
two and threw it down on the ground saying to the BandHere you
curs thats what youre afraid of The skeleton did not look pretty in
the twilight The BandSergeant seemed to recognize it for he began to
chuckle and choke Shall I take it away sir said the BandSergeant
Yes said the Colonel take it to Hell and ride there yourselves

The BandSergeant saluted hoisted the skeleton across his saddlebow
and led off to the stables Then the Colonel began to make inquiries
for the rest of the Regiment and the language he used was wonderful He
would disband the Regimenthe would courtmartial every soul in ithe
would not command such a set of rabble and so on and so on As the
men dropped in his language grew wilder until at last it exceeded the
utmost limits of free speech allowed even to a Colonel of Horse

Martyn took HoganYale aside and suggested compulsory retirement from
the service as a necessity when all was discovered Martyn was the
weaker man of the two HoganYale put up his eyebrows and remarked
firstly that he was the son of a Lord and secondly that he was
as innocent as the babe unborn of the theatrical resurrection of the
DrumHorse

My instructions said Yale with a singularly sweet smile were that
the DrumHorse should be sent back as impressively as possible I ask
you AM I responsible if a muleheaded friend sends him back in such a
manner as to disturb the peace of mind of a regiment of Her Majestys
Cavalry

Martyn saidyou are a great man and will in time become a General
but Id give my chance of a troop to be safe out of this affair

Providence saved Martyn and HoganYale The SecondinCommand led the
Colonel away to the little curtained alcove wherein the subalterns of
the white Hussars were accustomed to play poker of nights and there
after many oaths on the Colonels part they talked together in low
tones I fancy that the SecondinCommand must have represented the
scare as the work of some trooper whom it would be hopeless to detect
and I know that he dwelt upon the sin and the shame of making a public
laughingstock of the scare

They will call us said the SecondinCommand who had really a fine
imagination they will call us the FlybyNights they will call us
the Ghost Hunters they will nickname us from one end of the Army list
to the other All the explanations in the world wont make outsiders
understand that the officers were away when the panic began For the
honor of the Regiment and for your own sake keep this thing quiet

The Colonel was so exhausted with anger that soothing him down was not
so difficult as might be imagined He was made to see gently and by
degrees that it was obviously impossible to courtmartial the whole
Regiment and equally impossible to proceed against any subaltern who
in his belief had any concern in the hoax

But the beasts alive Hes never been shot at all shouted the
Colonel Its flat flagrant disobedience Ive known a man broke for
less dd sight less Theyre mocking me I tell you Mutman Theyre
mocking me

Once more the SecondinCommand set himself to sooth the Colonel
and wrestled with him for halfanhour At the end of that time the
Regimental SergeantMajor reported himself The situation was rather
novel tell to him but he was not a man to be put out by circumstances
He saluted and said Regiment all come back Sir Then to propitiate
the ColonelAn none of the horses any the worse Sir

The Colonel only snorted and answeredYoud better tuck the men into
their cots then and see that they dont wake up and cry in the night
The Sergeant withdrew

His little stroke of humor pleased the Colonel and further he
felt slightly ashamed of the language he had been using The
SecondinCommand worried him again and the two sat talking far into
the night

Next day but one there was a Commanding Officers parade and the
Colonel harangued the White Hussars vigorously The pith of his speech
was that since the DrumHorse in his old age had proved himself capable
of cutting up the Whole Regiment he should return to his post of pride
at the head of the band BUT the Regiment were a set of ruffians with
bad consciences

The White Hussars shouted and threw everything movable about them into
the air and when the parade was over they cheered the Colonel till
they couldnt speak No cheers were put up for Lieutenant HoganYale
who smiled very sweetly in the background

Said the SecondinCommand to the Colonel unofficiallyThese little
things ensure popularity and do not the least affect discipline

But I went back on my word said the Colonel

Never mind said the SecondinCommand The White Hussars will follow
you anywhere from today Regiments are just like women They will do
anything for trinketry

A week later HoganYale received an extraordinary letter from some one
who signed himself Secretary Charity and Zeal 3709 E C and asked
for the return of our skeleton which we have reason to believe is in
your possession

Who the deuce is this lunatic who trades in bones said HoganYale

Beg your pardon Sir said the BandSergeant but the skeleton is
with me an Ill return it if youll pay the carriage into the Civil
Lines Theres a coffin with it Sir

HoganYale smiled and handed two rupees to the BandSergeant
sayingWrite the date on the skull will you

If you doubt this story and know where to go you can see the date on
the skeleton But dont mention the matter to the White Hussars

I happen to know something about it because I prepared the DrumHorse
for his resurrection He did not take kindly to the skeleton at all




THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCECASE


 In the daytime when she moved about me
 In the night when she was sleeping at my side
 I was wearied I was wearied of her presence
 Day by day and night by night I grew to hate her
 Would to God that she or I had died

 Confessions


There was a man called Bronckhorsta threecornered middleaged man
in the Armygray as a badger and some people said with a touch of
countryblood in him That however cannot be proved Mrs Bronckhorst
was not exactly young though fifteen years younger than her husband
She was a large pale quiet woman with heavy eyelids over weak eyes
and hair that turned red or yellow as the lights fell on it

Bronckhorst was not nice in any way He had no respect for the pretty
public and private lies that make life a little less nasty than it is
His manner towards his wife was coarse There are many thingsincluding
actual assault with the clenched fistthat a wife will endure but
seldom a wife can bearas Mrs Bronckhorst borewith a long course of
brutal hard chaff making light of her weaknesses her headaches her
small fits of gayety her dresses her queer little attempts to make
herself attractive to her husband when she knows that she is not
what she has been andworst of allthe love that she spends on her
children That particular sort of heavyhanded jest was specially dear
to Bronckhorst I suppose that he had first slipped into it meaning
no harm in the honeymoon when folk find their ordinary stock of
endearments run short and so go to the other extreme to express their
feelings A similar impulse makes a man sayHutt you old beast
when a favorite horse nuzzles his coatfront Unluckily when the
reaction of marriage sets in the form of speech remains and the
tenderness having died out hurts the wife more than she cares to say
But Mrs Bronckhorst was devoted to her teddy as she called him
Perhaps that was why he objected to her Perhapsthis is only a theory
to account for his infamous behavior later onhe gave way to the queer
savage feeling that sometimes takes by the throat a husband twenty
years married when he sees across the table the same face of
his wedded wife and knows that as he has sat facing it so must he
continue to sit until day of its death or his own Most men and all
women know the spasm It only lasts for three breaths as a rule must be
a throwback to times when men and women were rather worse than they
are now and is too unpleasant to be discussed

Dinner at the Bronckhorsts was an infliction few men cared to undergo
Bronckhorst took a pleasure in saying things that made his wife wince
When their little boy came in at dessert Bronckhorst used to give him
half a glass of wine and naturally enough the poor little mite got
first riotous next miserable and was removed screaming Bronckhorst
asked if that was the way Teddy usually behaved and whether Mrs
Bronckhorst could not spare some of her time to teach the little beggar
decency Mrs Bronckhorst who loved the boy more than her own life
tried not to cryher spirit seemed to have been broken by her marriage
Lastly Bronckhorst used to sayThere Thatll do thatll do
For Gods sake try to behave like a rational woman Go into the
drawingroom Mrs Bronckhorst would go trying to carry it all
off with a smile and the guest of the evening would feel angry and
uncomfortable

After three years of this cheerful lifefor Mrs Bronckhorst had no
womanfriends to talk tothe Station was startled by the news that
Bronckhorst had instituted proceedings ON THE CRIMINAL COUNT against
a man called Biel who certainly had been rather attentive to Mrs
Bronckhorst whenever she had appeared in public The utter want of
reserve with which Bronckhorst treated his own dishonor helped us to
know that the evidence against Biel would be entirely circumstantial and
native There were no letters but Bronckhorst said openly that he would
rack Heaven and Earth until he saw Biel superintending the manufacture
of carpets in the Central Jail Mrs Bronckhorst kept entirely to her
house and let charitable folks say what they pleased Opinions were
divided Some twothirds of the Station jumped at once to the conclusion
that Biel was guilty but a dozen men who knew and liked him held by
him Biel was furious and surprised He denied the whole thing and
vowed that he would thrash Bronckhorst within an inch of his life
No jury we knew could convict a man on the criminal count on native
evidence in a land where you can buy a murdercharge including the
corpse all complete for fiftyfour rupees but Biel did not care to
scrape through by the benefit of a doubt He wanted the whole thing
cleared but as he said one nightHe can prove anything with
servants evidence and Ive only my bare word This was about a month
before the case came on and beyond agreeing with Biel we could do
little All that we could be sure of was that the native evidence would
be bad enough to blast Biels character for the rest of his service for
when a native begins perjury he perjures himself thoroughly He does not
boggle over details

Some genius at the end of the table whereat the affair was being talked
over saidLook here I dont believe lawyers are any good Get a man
to wire to Strickland and beg him to come down and pull us through

Strickland was about a hundred and eighty miles up the line He had
not long been married to Miss Youghal but he scented in the telegram a
chance of return to the old detective work that his soul lusted after
and next night he came in and heard our story He finished his pipe and
said oracularlywe must get at the evidence Oorya bearer Mussalman
khit and methraniayah I suppose are the pillars of the charge I am on
in this piece but Im afraid Im getting rusty in my talk

He rose and went into Biels bedroom where his trunk had been put and
shut the door An hour later we heard him sayI hadnt the heart
to part with my old makeups when I married Will this do There was a
lothely faquir salaaming in the doorway

Now lend me fifty rupees said Strickland and give me your Words of
Honor that you wont tell my Wife

He got all that he asked for and left the house while the table drank
his health What he did only he himself knows A faquir hung about
Bronckhorsts compound for twelve days Then a mehter appeared and when
Biel heard of HIM he said that Strickland was an angel fullfledged
Whether the mehter made love to Janki Mrs Bronckhorsts ayah is a
question which concerns Strickland exclusively

He came back at the end of three weeks and said quietlyYou spoke
the truth Biel The whole business is put up from beginning to end
Jove It almost astonishes ME That Bronckhorstbeast isnt fit to
live

There was uproar and shouting and Biel saidHow are you going to
prove it You cant say that youve been trespassing on Bronckhorsts
compound in disguise

No said Strickland Tell your lawyerfool whoever he is to get up
something strong about inherent improbabilities and discrepancies of
evidence He wont have to speak but it will make him happy IM going
to run this business

Biel held his tongue and the other men waited to see what would happen
They trusted Strickland as men trust quiet men When the case came off
the Court was crowded Strickland hung about in the verandah of the
Court till he met the Mohammedan khitmatgar Then he murmured a
faquirs blessing in his ear and asked him how his second wife did The
man spun round and as he looked into the eyes of Estreeken Sahib
his jaw dropped You must remember that before Strickland was married
he was as I have told you already a power among natives Strickland
whispered a rather coarse vernacular proverb to the effect that he was
abreast of all that was going on and went into the Court armed with a
gut trainerswhip

The Mohammedan was the first witness and Strickland beamed upon him from
the back of the Court The man moistened his lips with his tongue and
in his abject fear of Estreeken Sahib the faquir went back on every
detail of his evidencesaid he was a poor man and God was his witness
that he had forgotten every thing that Bronckhorst Sahib had told him
to say Between his terror of Strickland the Judge and Bronckhorst he
collapsed weeping

Then began the panic among the witnesses Janki the ayah leering
chastely behind her veil turned gray and the bearer left the Court He
said that his Mamma was dying and that it was not wholesome for any man
to lie unthriftily in the presence of Estreeken Sahib

Biel said politely to BronckhorstYour witnesses dont seem to work
Havent you any forged letters to produce But Bronckhorst was swaying
to and fro in his chair and there was a dead pause after Biel had been
called to order

Bronckhorsts Counsel saw the look on his clients face and without
more ado pitched his papers on the little green baize table and
mumbled something about having been misinformed The whole Court
applauded wildly like soldiers at a theatre and the Judge began to say
what he thought

         

Biel came out of the place and Strickland dropped a gut trainerswhip
in the verandah Ten minutes later Biel was cutting Bronckhorst into
ribbons behind the old Court cells quietly and without scandal What
was left of Bronckhorst was sent home in a carriage and his wife wept
over it and nursed it into a man again

Later on after Biel had managed to hush up the countercharge against
Bronckhorst of fabricating false evidence Mrs Bronckhorst with her
faint watery smile said that there had been a mistake but it wasnt
her Teddys fault altogether She would wait till her Teddy came back to
her Perhaps he had grown tired of her or she had tried his patience
and perhaps we wouldnt cut her any more and perhaps the mothers would
let their children play with little Teddy again He was so lonely
Then the Station invited Mrs Bronckhorst everywhere until Bronckhorst
was fit to appear in public when he went Home and took his wife with
him According to the latest advices her Teddy did come back to her
and they are moderately happy Though of course he can never forgive
her the thrashing that she was the indirect means of getting for him

         

What Biel wants to know isWhy didnt I press home the charge against
the Bronckhorstbrute and have him run in

What Mrs Strickland wants to know isHow DID my husband bring such
a lovely lovely Waler from your Station I know ALL his moneyaffairs
and Im CERTAIN he didnt BUY it

What I want to know isHow do women like Mrs Bronckhorst come to
marry men like Bronckhorst

And my conundrum is the most unanswerable of the three




VENUS ANNODOMINI


 And the years went on as the years must do
 But our great Diana was always new
 Fresh and blooming and blonde and fair
 With azure eyes and with aureate hair
 And all the folk as they came or went
 Offered her praise to her hearts content

 Diana of Ephesus


She had nothing to do with Number Eighteen in the Braccio Nuovo of
the Vatican between Viscontis Ceres and the God of the Nile She was
purely an Indian deityan AngloIndian deity that is to sayand
we called her THE Venus Annodomini to distinguish her from other
Annodominis of the same everlasting order There was a legend among the
Hills that she had once been young but no living man was prepared to
come forward and say boldly that the legend was true Men rode up to
Simla and stayed and went away and made their name and did their
lifes work and returned again to find the Venus Annodomini exactly as
they had left her She was as immutable as the Hills But not quite
so green All that a girl of eighteen could do in the way of riding
walking dancing picnicking and overexertion generally the Venus
Annodomini did and showed no sign of fatigue or trace of weariness
Besides perpetual youth she had discovered men said the secret of
perpetual health and her fame spread about the land From a mere woman
she grew to be an Institution insomuch that no young man could be said
to be properly formed who had not at some time or another worshipped
at the shrine of the Venus Annodomini There was no one like her though
there were many imitations Six years in her eyes were no more than six
months to ordinary women and ten made less visible impression on her
than does a weeks fever on an ordinary woman Every one adored her and
in return she was pleasant and courteous to nearly every one Youth had
been a habit of hers for so long that she could not part with itnever
realized in fact the necessity of parting with itand took for her
more chosen associates young people

Among the worshippers of the Venus Annodomini was young Gayerson
Very Young Gayerson he was called to distinguish him from his father
Young Gayerson a Bengal Civilian who affected the customsas he had
the heartof youth Very Young Gayerson was not content to worship
placidly and for forms sake as the other young men did or to accept
a ride or a dance or a talk from the Venus Annodomini in a properly
humble and thankful spirit He was exacting and therefore the Venus
Annodomini repressed him He worried himself nearly sick in a futile
sort of way over her and his devotion and earnestness made him appear
either shy or boisterous or rude as his mood might vary by the side of
the older men who with him bowed before the Venus Annodomini She was
sorry for him He reminded her of a lad who threeandtwenty years ago
had professed a boundless devotion for her and for whom in return she
had felt something more than a weeks weakness But that lad had fallen
away and married another woman less than a year after he had worshipped
her and the Venus Annodomini had almostnot quiteforgotten his name
Very Young Gayerson had the same big blue eyes and the same way of
pouting his underlip when he was excited or troubled But the Venus
Annodomini checked him sternly none the less Too much zeal was a thing
that she did not approve of preferring instead a tempered and sober
tenderness

Very Young Gayerson was miserable and took no trouble to conceal his
wretchedness He was in the Armya Line regiment I think but am not
certainand since his face was a lookingglass and his forehead an
open book by reason of his innocence his brothers in arms made his
life a burden to him and embittered his naturally sweet disposition No
one except Very Young Gayerson and he never told his views knew how
old Very Young Gayerson believed the Venus Annodomini to be Perhaps
he thought her five and twenty or perhaps she told him that she was
this age Very Young Gayerson would have forded the Gugger in flood to
carry her lightest word and had implicit faith in her Every one liked
him and every one was sorry when they saw him so bound a slave of the
Venus Annodomini Every one too admitted that it was not her fault
for the Venus Annodomini differed from Mrs Hauksbee and Mrs Reiver in
this particularshe never moved a finger to attract any one but like
Ninon de lEnclos all men were attracted to her One could admire and
respect Mrs Hauksbee despise and avoid Mrs Reiver but one was forced
to adore the Venus Annodomini

Very Young Gayersons papa held a Division or a Collectorate
or something administrative in a particularly unpleasant part of
Bengalfull of Babus who edited newspapers proving that Young
Gayerson was a Nero and a Scylla and a Charybdis and in addition
to the Babus there was a good deal of dysentery and cholera abroad
for nine months of the year Young Gayersonhe was about five and
fortyrather liked Babus they amused him but he objects to dysentery
and when he could get away went to Darjilling for the most part This
particular season he fancied that he would come up to Simla and see his
boy The boy was not altogether pleased He told the Venus Annodomini
that his father was coming up and she flushed a little and said that
she should be delighted to make his acquaintance Then she looked long
and thoughtfully at Very Young Gayerson because she was very very
sorry for him and he was a very very big idiot

My daughter is coming out in a fortnight Mr Gayerson she said

Your WHAT said he

Daughter said the Venus Annodomini Shes been out for a year at
Home already and I want her to see a little of India She is nineteen
and a very sensible nice girl I believe

Very Young Gayerson who was a short twentytwo years old nearly fell
out of his chair with astonishment for he had persisted in believing
against all belief in the youth of the Venus Annodomini She with her
back to the curtained window watched the effect of her sentences and
smiled

Very Young Gayersons papa came up twelve days later and had not been
in Simla four and twenty hours before two men old acquaintances of
his had told him how Very Young Gayerson had been conducting himself

Young Gayerson laughed a good deal and inquired who the Venus
Annodomini might be Which proves that he had been living in Bengal
where nobody knows anything except the rate of Exchange Then he said
boys will be boys and spoke to his son about the matter Very Young
Gayerson said that he felt wretched and unhappy and Young Gayerson
said that he repented of having helped to bring a fool into the world
He suggested that his son had better cut his leave short and go down to
his duties This led to an unfilial answer and relations were strained
until Young Gayerson demmanded that they should call on the Venus
Annodomini Very Young Gayerson went with his papa feeling somehow
uncomfortable and small

The Venus Annodomini received them graciously and Young Gayerson
saidBy Jove Its Kitty Very Young Gayerson would have listened
for an explanation if his time had not been taken up with trying to
talk to a large handsome quiet welldressed girlintroduced to him
by the Venus Annodomini as her daughter She was far older in manners
style and repose than Very Young Gayerson and as he realized this
thing he felt sick

Presently he heard the Venus Annodomini sayingDo you know that your
son is one of my most devoted admirers

I dont wonder said Young Gayerson Here he raised his voiceHe
follows his fathers footsteps Didnt I worship the ground you trod on
ever so long ago Kittyand you havent changed since then How strange
it all seems

Very Young Gayerson said nothing His conversation with the daughter
of the Venus Annodomini was through the rest of the call fragmentary
and disjointed

         

At five tomorrow then said the Venus Annodomini And mind you are
punctual

At five punctual said Young Gayerson You can lend your old father
a horse I dare say youngster cant you Im going for a ride tomorrow
afternoon

Certainly said Very Young Gayerson I am going down tomorrow
morning My ponies are at your service Sir

The Venus Annodomini looked at him across the halflight of the room
and her big gray eyes filled with moisture She rose and shook hands
with him

Goodbye Tom whispered the Venus Annodomini




THE BISARA OF POOREE


 Little Blind Fish thou art marvellous wise
 Little Blind Fish who put out thy eyes
 Open thine ears while I whisper my wish
 Bring me a lover thou little Blind Fish

 The Charm of the Bisara


Some natives say that it came from the other side of Kulu where
the eleveninch Temple Sapphire is Others that it was made at the
DevilShrine of AoChung in Thibet was stolen by a Kafir from him by
a Gurkha from him again by a Lahouli from him by a khitmatgar and by
this latter sold to an Englishman so all its virtue was lost because
to work properly the Bisara of Pooree must be stolenwith bloodshed if
possible but at any rate stolen

These stories of the coming into India are all false It was made at
Pooree ages sincethe manner of its making would fill a small bookwas
stolen by one of the Temple dancinggirls there for her own purposes
and then passed on from hand to hand steadily northward till it
reached Hanla always bearing the same namethe Bisara of Pooree In
shape it is a tiny square box of silver studded outside with eight
small balasrubies Inside the box which opens with a spring is
a little eyeless fish carved from some sort of dark shiny nut and
wrapped in a shred of faded goldcloth That is the Bisara of Pooree
and it were better for a man to take a king cobra in his hand than to
touch the Bisara of Pooree

All kinds of magic are out of date and done away with except in India
where nothing changes in spite of the shiny toyscum stuff that people
call civilization Any man who knows about the Bisara of Pooree will
tell you what its powers arealways supposing that it has been honestly
stolen It is the only regularly working trustworthy lovecharm in the
country with one exception

The other charm is in the hands of a trooper of the Nizams Horse at a
place called Tuprani due north of Hyderabad This can be depended upon
for a fact Some one else may explain it

If the Bisara be not stolen but given or bought or found it turns
against its owner in three years and leads to ruin or death This is
another fact which you may explain when you have time Meanwhile you
can laugh at it At present the Bisara is safe on an ekkaponys
neck inside the blue beadnecklace that keeps off the Evileye If the
ekkadriver ever finds it and wears it or gives it to his wife I am
sorry for him

A very dirty hillcooly woman with goitre owned it at Theog in 1884
It came into Simla from the north before Churtons khitmatgar bought it
and sold it for three times its silvervalue to Churton who collected
curiosities The servant knew no more what he had bought than
the master but a man looking over Churtons collection of
curiositiesChurton was an Assistant Commissioner by the waysaw and
held his tongue He was an Englishman but knew how to believe Which
shows that he was different from most Englishmen He knew that it was
dangerous to have any share in the little box when working or dormant
for unsought Love is a terrible gift

PackGrubby Pack as we used to call himwas in every way a nasty
little man who must have crawled into the Army by mistake He was three
inches taller than his sword but not half so strong And the sword was
a fiftyshilling tailormade one Nobody liked him and I suppose it
was his wizenedness and worthlessness that made him fall so hopelessly
in love with Miss Hollis who was good and sweet and five foot seven in
her tennis shoes He was not content with falling in love quietly
but brought all the strength of his miserable little nature into the
business If he had not been so objectionable one might have pitied
him He vapored and fretted and fumed and trotted up and down and
tried to make himself pleasing in Miss Holliss big quiet gray eyes
and failed It was one of the cases that you sometimes meet even in
this country where we marry by Code of a really blind attachment all on
one side without the faintest possibility of return Miss Hollis
looked on Pack as some sort of vermin running about the road He had
no prospects beyond Captains pay and no wits to help that out by one
anna In a largesized man love like his would have been touching In
a good man it would have been grand He being what he was it was only a
nuisance

You will believe this much What you will not believe is what follows
Churton and The Man who Knew that the Bisara was were lunching at the
Simla Club together Churton was complaining of life in general His
best mare had rolled out of stable down the hill and had broken her
back his decisions were being reversed by the upper Courts more
than an Assistant Commissioner of eight years standing has a right to
expect he knew liver and fever and for weeks past had felt out of
sorts Altogether he was disgusted and disheartened

Simla Club diningroom is built as all the world knows in two
sections with an archarrangement dividing them Come in turn to your
own left take the table under the window and you cannot see any one
who has come in turning to the right and taken a table on the right
side of the arch Curiously enough every word that you say can be
heard not only by the other diner but by the servants beyond the
screen through which they bring dinner This is worth knowing an
echoingroom is a trap to be forewarned against

Half in fun and half hoping to be believed The Man who Knew told
Churton the story of the Bisara of Pooree at rather greater length than
I have told it to you in this place winding up with the suggestion that
Churton might as well throw the little box down the hill and see whether
all his troubles would go with it In ordinary ears English ears the
tale was only an interesting bit of folklore Churton laughed
said that he felt better for his tiffin and went out Pack had been
tiffining by himself to the right of the arch and had heard everything
He was nearly mad with his absurd infatuation for Miss Hollis that all
Simla had been laughing about

It is a curious thing that when a man hates or loves beyond reason he
is ready to go beyond reason to gratify his feelings Which he would not
do for money or power merely Depend upon it Solomon would never have
built altars to Ashtaroth and all those ladies with queer names if
there had not been trouble of some kind in his zenana and nowhere else
But this is beside the story The facts of the case are these Pack
called on Churton next day when Churton was out left his card and
STOLE the Bisara of Pooree from its place under the clock on the
mantelpiece Stole it like the thief he was by nature Three days later
all Simla was electrified by the news that Miss Hollis had accepted
Packthe shrivelled rat Pack Do you desire clearer evidence than
this The Bisara of Pooree had been stolen and it worked as it had
always done when won by foul means

There are three or four times in a mans lifewhen he is justified in
meddling with other peoples affairs to play Providence

The Man who Knew felt that he WAS justified but believing and acting on
a belief are quite different things The insolent satisfaction of Pack
as he ambled by the side of Miss Hollis and Churtons striking release
from liver as soon as the Bisara of Pooree had gone decided the Man
He explained to Churton and Churton laughed because he was not brought
up to believe that men on the Government House List stealat least
little things But the miraculous acceptance by Miss Hollis of that
tailor Pack decided him to take steps on suspicion He vowed that he
only wanted to find out where his rubystudded silver box had vanished
to You cannot accuse a man on the Government House List of stealing
And if you rifle his room you are a thief yourself Churton prompted
by The Man who Knew decided on burglary If he found nothing in Packs
room but it is not nice to think of what would have happened in that
case

Pack went to a dance at BenmoreBenmore WAS Benmore in those days and
not an officeand danced fifteen waltzes out of twentytwo with Miss
Hollis Churton and The Man took all the keys that they could lay hands
on and went to Packs room in the hotel certain that his servants
would be away Pack was a cheap soul He had not purchased a decent
cashbox to keep his papers in but one of those native imitations that
you buy for ten rupees It opened to any sort of key and there at the
bottom under Packs Insurance Policy lay the Bisara of Pooree

Churton called Pack names put the Bisara of Pooree in his pocket and
went to the dance with The Man At least he came in time for supper
and saw the beginning of the end in Miss Holliss eyes She was
hysterical after supper and was taken away by her Mamma

At the dance with the abominable Bisara in his pocket Churton twisted
his foot on one of the steps leading down to the old Rink and had to be
sent home in a rickshaw grumbling He did not believe in the Bisara of
Pooree any the more for this manifestation but he sought out Pack and
called him some ugly names and thief was the mildest of them Pack
took the names with the nervous smile of a little man who wants both
soul and body to resent an insult and went his way There was no public
scandal

A week later Pack got his definite dismissal from Miss Hollis There
had been a mistake in the placing of her affections she said So he
went away to Madras where he can do no great harm even if he lives to
be a Colonel

Churton insisted upon The Man who Knew taking the Bisara of Pooree as a
gift The Man took it went down to the Cart Road at once found an ekka
pony with a blue headnecklace fastened the Bisara of Pooree inside the
necklace with a piece of shoestring and thanked Heaven that he was
rid of a danger Remember in case you ever find it that you must not
destroy the Bisara of Pooree I have not time to explain why just now
but the power lies in the little wooden fish Mister Gubernatis or Max
Muller could tell you more about it than I

You will say that all this story is made up Very well If ever you come
across a little silver rubystudded box seveneighths of an inch long
by threequarters wide with a darkbrown wooden fish wrapped in gold
cloth inside it keep it Keep it for three years and then you will
discover for yourself whether my story is true or false

Better still steal it as Pack did and you will be sorry that you had
not killed yourself in the beginning




THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS


 If I can attain Heaven for a pice why should you be envious

 Opium Smokers Proverb


This is no work of mine My friend Gabral Misquitta the halfcaste
spoke it all between moonset and morning six weeks before he died and
I took it down from his mouth as he answered my questions so

It lies between the Coppersmiths Gully and the pipestem sellers
quarter within a hundred yards too as the crow flies of the Mosque
of Wazir Khan I dont mind telling any one this much but I defy him
to find the Gate however well he may think he knows the City You might
even go through the very gully it stands in a hundred times and be none
the wiser We used to call the gully the Gully of the Black Smoke
but its native name is altogether different of course A loaded donkey
couldnt pass between the walls and at one point just before you
reach the Gate a bulged housefront makes people go along all sideways

It isnt really a gate though Its a house Old FungTching had it
first five years ago He was a bootmaker in Calcutta They say that
he murdered his wife there when he was drunk That was why he dropped
bazarrum and took to the Black Smoke instead Later on he came up
north and opened the Gate as a house where you could get your smoke in
peace and quiet Mind you it was a pukka respectable opiumhouse and
not one of those stifling sweltering chandookhanas that you can find
all over the City No the old man knew his business thoroughly and he
was most clean for a Chinaman He was a oneeyed little chap not much
more than five feet high and both his middle fingers were gone All the
same he was the handiest man at rolling black pills I have ever seen
Never seemed to be touched by the Smoke either and what he took day
and night night and day was a caution Ive been at it five years and
I can do my fair share of the Smoke with any one but I was a child to
FungTching that way All the same the old man was keen on his money
very keen and thats what I cant understand I heard he saved a good
deal before he died but his nephew has got all that now and the old
mans gone back to China to be buried

He kept the big upper room where his best customers gathered as neat
as a new pin In one corner used to stand FungTchings Jossalmost
as ugly as FungTchingand there were always sticks burning under his
nose but you never smelt em when the pipes were going thick Opposite
the Joss was FungTchings coffin He had spent a good deal of his
savings on that and whenever a new man came to the Gate he was always
introduced to it It was lacquered black with red and gold writings
on it and Ive heard that FungTching brought it out all the way from
China I dont know whether thats true or not but I know that if I
came first in the evening I used to spread my mat just at the foot of
it It was a quiet corner you see and a sort of breeze from the gully
came in at the window now and then Besides the mats there was no other
furniture in the roomonly the coffin and the old Joss all green and
blue and purple with age and polish

FungTching never told us why he called the place The Gate of a Hundred
Sorrows He was the only Chinaman I know who used badsounding fancy
names Most of them are flowery As youll see in Calcutta We used
to find that out for ourselves Nothing grows on you so much if youre
white as the Black Smoke A yellow man is made different Opium doesnt
tell on him scarcely at all but white and black suffer a good deal Of
course there are some people that the Smoke doesnt touch any more than
tobacco would at first They just doze a bit as one would fall asleep
naturally and next morning they are almost fit for work Now I was
one of that sort when I began but Ive been at it for five years pretty
steadily and its different now There was an old aunt of mine down
Agra way and she left me a little at her death About sixty rupees a
month secured Sixty isnt much I can recollect a time seems hundreds
and hundreds of years ago that I was getting my three hundred a month
and pickings when I was working on a big timber contract in Calcutta

I didnt stick to that work for long The Black Smoke does not allow of
much other business and even though I am very little affected by it as
men go I couldnt do a days work now to save my life After all sixty
rupees is what I want When old FungTching was alive he used to draw
the money for me give me about half of it to live on I eat very
little and the rest he kept himself I was free of the Gate at any
time of the day and night and could smoke and sleep there when I liked
so I didnt care I know the old man made a good thing out of it but
thats no matter Nothing matters much to me and besides the money
always came fresh and fresh each month

There was ten of us met at the Gate when the place was first opened Me
and two Baboos from a Government Office somewhere in Anarkulli but they
got the sack and couldnt pay no man who has to work in the daylight
can do the Black Smoke for any length of time straight on a Chinaman
that was FungTchings nephew a bazarwoman that had got a lot of
money somehow an English loaferMacSomebody I think but I have
forgottenthat smoked heaps but never seemed to pay anything they
said he had saved FungTchings life at some trial in Calcutta when
he was a barrister another Eurasian like myself from Madras a
halfcaste woman and a couple of men who said they had come from the
North I think they must have been Persians or Afghans or something
There are not more than five of us living now but we come regular I
dont know what happened to the Baboos but the bazarwoman she died
after six months of the Gate and I think FungTching took her bangles
and nosering for himself But Im not certain The Englishman he drank
as well as smoked and he dropped off One of the Persians got killed in
a row at night by the big well near the mosque a long time ago and the
Police shut up the well because they said it was full of foul air They
found him dead at the bottom of it So you see there is only me the
Chinaman the halfcaste woman that we call the Memsahib she used to
live with FungTching the other Eurasian and one of the Persians The
Memsahib looks very old now I think she was a young woman when the
Gate was opened but we are all old for the matter of that Hundreds
and hundreds of years old It is very hard to keep count of time in the
Gate and besides time doesnt matter to me I draw my sixty rupees
fresh and fresh every month A very very long while ago when I used
to be getting three hundred and fifty rupees a month and pickings on
a big timbercontract at Calcutta I had a wife of sorts But shes dead
now People said that I killed her by taking to the Black Smoke Perhaps
I did but its so long since it doesnt matter Sometimes when I first
came to the Gate I used to feel sorry for it but thats all over and
done with long ago and I draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every
month and am quite happy Not DRUNK happy you know but always quiet
and soothed and contented

How did I take to it It began at Calcutta I used to try it in my own
house just to see what it was like I never went very far but I think
my wife must have died then Anyhow I found myself here and got to
know FungTching I dont remember rightly how that came about but he
told me of the Gate and I used to go there and somehow I have never
got away from it since Mind you though the Gate was a respectable
place in FungTchings time where you could be comfortable and not at
all like the chandookhanas where the niggers go No it was clean and
quiet and not crowded Of course there were others beside us ten
and the man but we always had a mat apiece with a wadded woollen
headpiece all covered with black and red dragons and things just like
a coffin in the corner

At the end of ones third pipe the dragons used to move about and fight
Ive watched em many and many a night through I used to regulate
my Smoke that way and now it takes a dozen pipes to make em stir
Besides they are all torn and dirty like the mats and old FungTching
is dead He died a couple of years ago and gave me the pipe I always
use nowa silver one with queer beasts crawling up and down the
receiverbottle below the cup Before that I think I used a big bamboo
stem with a copper cup a very small one and a green jade mouthpiece
It was a little thicker than a walkingstick stem and smoked sweet
very sweet The bamboo seemed to suck up the smoke Silver doesnt and
Ive got to clean it out now and then thats a great deal of trouble
but I smoke it for the old mans sake He must have made a good thing
out of me but he always gave me clean mats and pillows and the best
stuff you could get anywhere

When he died his nephew Tsinling took up the Gate and he called it
the Temple of the Three Possessions but we old ones speak of it
as the Hundred Sorrows all the same The nephew does things very
shabbily and I think the Memsahib must help him She lives with him
same as she used to do with the old man The two let in all sorts of low
people niggers and all and the Black Smoke isnt as good as it used
to be Ive found burnt bran in my pipe over and over again The old man
would have died if that had happened in his time Besides the room
is never cleaned and all the mats are torn and cut at the edges The
coffin has gonegone to China againwith the old man and two ounces of
smoke inside it in case he should want em on the way

The Joss doesnt get so many sticks burnt under his nose as he used to
thats a sign of illluck as sure as Death Hes all brown too and
no one ever attends to him Thats the Memsahibs work I know because
when Tsinling tried to burn gilt paper before him she said it was a
waste of money and if he kept a stick burning very slowly the Joss
wouldnt know the difference So now weve got the sticks mixed with
a lot of glue and they take halfanhour longer to burn and smell
stinky Let alone the smell of the room by itself No business can get
on if they try that sort of thing The Joss doesnt like it I can see
that Late at night sometimes he turns all sorts of queer colorsblue
and green and redjust as he used to do when old FungTching was alive
and he rolls his eyes and stamps his feet like a devil

I dont know why I dont leave the place and smoke quietly in a little
room of my own in the bazar Most like Tsinling would kill me if
I went awayhe draws my sixty rupees nowand besides its so much
trouble and Ive grown to be very fond of the Gate Its not much to
look at Not what it was in the old mans time but I couldnt leave it
Ive seen so many come in and out And Ive seen so many die here on the
mats that I should be afraid of dying in the open now Ive seen some
things that people would call strange enough but nothing is strange
when youre on the Black Smoke except the Black Smoke And if it was
it wouldnt matter FungTching used to be very particular about his
people and never got in any one whod give trouble by dying messy and
such But the nephew isnt half so careful He tells everywhere that he
keeps a firstchop house Never tries to get men in quietly and make
them comfortable like FungTching did Thats why the Gate is getting a
little bit more known than it used to be Among the niggers of course
The nephew darent get a white or for matter of that a mixed skin
into the place He has to keep us three of courseme and the Memsahib
and the other Eurasian Were fixtures But he wouldnt give us credit
for a pipefulnot for anything

One of these days I hope I shall die in the Gate The Persian and
the Madras man are terrible shaky now Theyve got a boy to light their
pipes for them I always do that myself Most like I shall see them
carried out before me I dont think I shall ever outlive the Memsahib
or Tsinling Women last longer than men at the BlackSmoke and
Tsinling has a deal of the old mans blood in him though he DOES smoke
cheap stuff The bazarwoman knew when she was going two days before her
time and SHE died on a clean mat with a nicely wadded pillow and the
old man hung up her pipe just above the Joss He was always fond of her
I fancy But he took her bangles just the same

I should like to die like the bazarwomanon a clean cool mat with a
pipe of good stuff between my lips When I feel Im going I shall ask
Tsinling for them and he can draw my sixty rupees a month fresh and
fresh as long as he pleases and watch the black and red dragons have
their last big fight together and then

Well it doesnt matter Nothing matters much to meonly I wished
Tsinling wouldnt put bran into the Black Smoke




THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN


 Who is the happy man He that sees in his own house at home little
 children crowned with dust leaping and falling and crying

 Munichandra translated by Professor Peterson


The poloball was an old one scarred chipped and dinted It stood
on the mantelpiece among the pipestems which Imam Din khitmatgar was
cleaning for me

Does the Heavenborn want this ball said Imam Din deferentially

The Heavenborn set no particular store by it but of what use was a
poloball to a khitmatgar

By Your Honors favor I have a little son He has seen this ball and
desires it to play with I do not want it for myself

No one would for an instant accuse portly old Imam Din of wanting
to play with poloballs He carried out the battered thing into the
verandah and there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks a patter of
small feet and the thudthudthud of the ball rolling along the ground
Evidently the little son had been waiting outside the door to secure his
treasure But how had he managed to see that poloball

Next day coming back from office half an hour earlier than usual I was
aware of a small figure in the diningrooma tiny plump figure in a
ridiculously inadequate shirt which came perhaps halfway down the
tubby stomach It wandered round the room thumb in mouth crooning
to itself as it took stock of the pictures Undoubtedly this was the
little son

He had no business in my room of course but was so deeply absorbed in
his discoveries that he never noticed me in the doorway I stepped into
the room and startled him nearly into a fit He sat down on the ground
with a gasp His eyes opened and his mouth followed suit I knew what
was coming and fled followed by a long dry howl which reached the
servants quarters far more quickly than any command of mine had ever
done In ten seconds Imam Din was in the diningroom Then despairing
sobs arose and I returned to find Imam Din admonishing the small sinner
who was using most of his shirt as a handkerchief

This boy said Imam Din judicially is a budmash a big budmash
He will without doubt go to the jailkhana for his behavior Renewed
yells from the penitent and an elaborate apology to myself from Imam
Din

Tell the baby said I that the Sahib is not angry and take him
away Imam Din conveyed my forgiveness to the offender who had
now gathered all his shirt round his neck stringwise and the yell
subsided into a sob The two set off for the door His name said Imam
Din as though the name were part of the crime is Muhammad Din and he
is a budmash Freed from present danger Muhammad Din turned round
in his fathers arms and said gravelyIt is true that my name is
Muhammad Din Tahib but I am not a budmash I am a MAN

From that day dated my acquaintance with Muhammad Din Never again did
he come into my diningroom but on the neutral ground of the compound
we greeted each other with much state though our conversation was
confined to Talaam Tahib from his side and Salaam Muhammad Din from
mine Daily on my return from office the little white shirt and the
fat little body used to rise from the shade of the creepercovered
trellis where they had been hid and daily I checked my horse here that
my salutation might not be slurred over or given unseemly

Muhammad Din never had any companions He used to trot about the
compound in and out of the castoroil bushes on mysterious errands
of his own One day I stumbled upon some of his handiwork far down
the ground He had half buried the poloball in dust and stuck six
shrivelled old marigold flowers in a circle round it Outside that
circle again was a rude square traced out in bits of red brick
alternating with fragments of broken china the whole bounded by a
little bank of dust The bhistie from the wellcurb put in a plea for
the small architect saying that it was only the play of a baby and did
not much disfigure my garden

Heaven knows that I had no intention of touching the childs work then
or later but that evening a stroll through the garden brought me
unawares full on it so that I trampled before I knew marigoldheads
dustbank and fragments of broken soapdish into confusion past all
hope of mending Next morning I came upon Muhammad Din crying softly to
himself over the ruin I had wrought Some one had cruelly told him
that the Sahib was very angry with him for spoiling the garden and had
scattered his rubbish using bad language the while Muhammad Din
labored for an hour at effacing every trace of the dustbank and pottery
fragments and it was with a tearful apologetic face that he said
Talaam Tahib when I came home from the office A hasty inquiry
resulted in Imam Din informing Muhammad Din that by my singular favor he
was permitted to disport himself as he pleased Whereat the child took
heart and fell to tracing the groundplan of an edifice which was to
eclipse the marigoldpoloball creation

For some months the chubby little eccentricity revolved in his humble
orbit among the castoroil bushes and in the dust always fashioning
magnificent palaces from stale flowers thrown away by the bearer smooth
waterworn pebbles bits of broken glass and feathers pulled I fancy
from my fowlsalways alone and always crooning to himself

A gaylyspotted seashell was dropped one day close to the last of his
little buildings and I looked that Muhammad Din should build something
more than ordinarily splendid on the strength of it Nor was I
disappointed He meditated for the better part of an hour and his
crooning rose to a jubilant song Then he began tracing in dust It
would certainly be a wondrous palace this one for it was two
yards long and a yard broad in groundplan But the palace was never
completed

Next day there was no Muhammad Din at the head of the carriagedrive
and no Talaam Tahib to welcome my return I had grown accustomed to
the greeting and its omission troubled me Next day Imam Din told me
that the child was suffering slightly from fever and needed quinine He
got the medicine and an English Doctor

They have no stamina these brats said the Doctor as he left Imam
Dins quarters

A week later though I would have given much to have avoided it I met
on the road to the Mussulman buryingground Imam Din accompanied by one
other friend carrying in his arms wrapped in a white cloth all that
was left of little Muhammad Din




ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS


 If your mirror be broken look into still water but have a care
 that you do not fall in

 Hindu Proverb


Next to a requited attachment one of the most convenient things that a
young man can carry about with him at the beginning of his career is
an unrequited attachment It makes him feel important and businesslike
and blase and cynical and whenever he has a touch of liver or suffers
from want of exercise he can mourn over his lost love and be very
happy in a tender twilight fashion

Hannasydes affair of the heart had been a Godsend to him It was four
years old and the girl had long since given up thinking of it She had
married and had many cares of her own In the beginning she had told
Hannasyde that while she could never be anything more than a sister
to him she would always take the deepest interest in his welfare This
startlingly new and original remark gave Hannasyde something to think
over for two years and his own vanity filled in the other twentyfour
months Hannasyde was quite different from Phil Garron but none the
less had several points in common with that far too lucky man

He kept his unrequited attachment by him as men keep a wellsmoked
pipefor comforts sake and because it had grown dear in the using It
brought him happily through the Simla season Hannasyde was not lovely
There was a crudity in his manners and a roughness in the way in which
he helped a lady on to her horse that did not attract the other sex
to him Even if he had cast about for their favor which he did not He
kept his wounded heart all to himself for a while

Then trouble came to him All who go to Simla know the slope from the
Telegraph to the Public Works Office Hannasyde was loafing up the hill
one September morning between calling hours when a rickshaw came down
in a hurry and in the rickshaw sat the living breathing image of the
girl who had made him so happily unhappy Hannasyde leaned against the
railing and gasped He wanted to run downhill after the rickshaw but
that was impossible so he went forward with most of his blood in his
temples It was impossible for many reasons that the woman in the
rickshaw could be the girl he had known She was he discovered later
the wife of a man from Dindigul or Coimbatore or some outoftheway
place and she had come up to Simla early in the season for the good of
her health She was going back to Dindigul or wherever it was at the
end of the season and in all likelihood would never return to Simla
again her proper Hillstation being Ootacamund That night Hannasyde
raw and savage from the raking up of all old feelings took counsel with
himself for one measured hour What he decided upon was this and you
must decide for yourself how much genuine affection for the old love
and how much a very natural inclination to go abroad and enjoy himself
affected the decision Mrs LandysHaggert would never in all human
likelihood cross his path again So whatever he did didnt much matter
She was marvellously like the girl who took a deep interest and the
rest of the formula All things considered it would be pleasant to make
the acquaintance of Mrs LandysHaggert and for a little timeonly a
very little timeto make believe that he was with Alice Chisane again
Every one is more or less mad on one point Hannasydes particular
monomania was his old love Alice Chisane

He made it his business to get introduced to Mrs Haggert and the
introduction prospered He also made it his business to see as much as
he could of that lady When a man is in earnest as to interviews the
facilities which Simla offers are startling There are gardenparties
and tennisparties and picnics and luncheons at Annandale and
riflematches and dinners and balls besides rides and walks which are
matters of private arrangement Hannasyde had started with the intention
of seeing a likeness and he ended by doing much more He wanted to
be deceived he meant to be deceived and he deceived himself very
thoroughly Not only were the face and figure the face and figure of
Alice Chisane but the voice and lower tones were exactly the same and
so were the turns of speech and the little mannerisms that every woman
has of gait and gesticulation were absolutely and identically the
same The turn of the head was the same the tired look in the eyes
at the end of a long walk was the same the sloop and wrench over
the saddle to hold in a pulling horse was the same and once most
marvellous of all Mrs LandysHaggert singing to herself in the next
room while Hannasyde was waiting to take her for a ride hummed note
for note with a throaty quiver of the voice in the second linePoor
Wandering One exactly as Alice Chisane had hummed it for Hannasyde in
the dusk of an English drawingroom In the actual woman herselfin
the soul of herthere was not the least likeness she and Alice Chisane
being cast in different moulds But all that Hannasyde wanted to know
and see and think about was this maddening and perplexing likeness of
face and voice and manner He was bent on making a fool of himself that
way and he was in no sort disappointed

Open and obvious devotion from any sort of man is always pleasant to
any sort of woman but Mrs LandysHaggert being a woman of the world
could make nothing of Hannasydes admiration

He would take any amount of troublehe was a selfish man habituallyto
meet and forestall if possible her wishes Anything she told him to do
was law and he was there could be no doubting it fond of her company
so long as she talked to him and kept on talking about trivialities
But when she launched into expression of her personal views and her
wrongs those small social differences that make the spice of Simla
life Hannasyde was neither pleased nor interested He didnt want
to know anything about Mrs LandysHaggert or her experiences in
the pastshe had travelled nearly all over the world and could talk
cleverlyhe wanted the likeness of Alice Chisane before his eyes and
her voice in his ears Anything outside that reminding him of another
personality jarred and he showed that it did

Under the new Post Office one evening Mrs LandysHaggert turned on
him and spoke her mind shortly and without warning Mr Hannasyde
said she will you be good enough to explain why you have appointed
yourself my special cavalier servente I dont understand it But I
am perfectly certain somehow or other that you dont care the least
little bit in the world for ME This seems to support by the way the
theory that no man can act or tell lies to a woman without being found
out Hannasyde was taken off his guard His defence never was a strong
one because he was always thinking of himself and he blurted out
before he knew what he was saying this inexpedient answerNo more I
do

The queerness of the situation and the reply made Mrs LandysHaggert
laugh Then it all came out and at the end of Hannasydes lucid
explanation Mrs Haggert said with the least little touch of scorn in
her voiceSo Im to act as the layfigure for you to hang the rags of
your tattered affections on am I

Hannasyde didnt see what answer was required and he devoted himself
generally and vaguely to the praise of Alice Chisane which was
unsatisfactory Now it is to be thoroughly made clear that Mrs Haggert
had not the shadow of a ghost of an interest in Hannasyde Only
only no woman likes being made love through instead of tospecially on
behalf of a musty divinity of four years standing

Hannasyde did not see that he had made any very particular exhibition
of himself He was glad to find a sympathetic soul in the arid wastes of
Simla

When the season ended Hannasyde went down to his own place and Mrs
Haggert to hers It was like making love to a ghost said Hannasyde
to himself and it doesnt matter and now Ill get to my work But
he found himself thinking steadily of the HaggertChisane ghost and he
could not be certain whether it was Haggert or Chisane that made up the
greater part of the pretty phantom

         

He got understanding a month later

A peculiar point of this peculiar country is the way in which a
heartless Government transfers men from one end of the Empire to the
other You can never be sure of getting rid of a friend or an enemy till
he or she dies There was a case oncebut thats another story

Haggerts Department ordered him up from Dindigul to the Frontier at
two days notice and he went through losing money at every step from
Dindigul to his station He dropped Mrs Haggert at Lucknow to stay
with some friends there to take part in a big ball at the Chutter
Munzil and to come on when he had made the new home a little
comfortable Lucknow was Hannasydes station and Mrs Haggert stayed
a week there Hannasyde went to meet her And the train came in
he discovered which he had been thinking of for the past month The
unwisdom of his conduct also struck him The Lucknow week with two
dances and an unlimited quantity of rides together clinched matters
and Hannasyde found himself pacing this circle of thoughtHe
adored Alice Chisaneat least he HAD adored her AND he admired
Mrs LandysHaggert because she was like Alice Chisane BUT Mrs
LandysHaggert was not in the least like Alice Chisane being a thousand
times more adorable NOW Alice Chisane was the bride of another and
so was Mrs LandysHaggert and a good and honest wife too THEREFORE
he Hannasyde was here he called himself several hard names and
wished that he had been wise in the beginning

Whether Mrs LandysHaggert saw what was going on in his mind she alone
knows He seemed to take an unqualified interest in everything connected
with herself as distinguished from the AliceChisane likeness and he
said one or two things which if Alice Chisane had been still betrothed
to him could scarcely have been excused even on the grounds of the
likeness But Mrs Haggert turned the remarks aside and spent a long
time in making Hannasyde see what a comfort and a pleasure she had been
to him because of her strange resemblance to his old love Hannasyde
groaned in his saddle and said Yes indeed and busied himself with
preparations for her departure to the Frontier feeling very small and
miserable

The last day of her stay at Lucknow came and Hannasyde saw her off
at the Railway Station She was very grateful for his kindness and the
trouble he had taken and smiled pleasantly and sympathetically as one
who knew the AliceChisane reason of that kindness And Hannasyde abused
the coolies with the luggage and hustled the people on the platform
and prayed that the roof might fall in and slay him

As the train went out slowly Mrs LandysHaggert leaned out of the
window to say goodbyeOn second thoughts au revoir Mr Hannasyde I
go Home in the Spring and perhaps I may meet you in Town

Hannasyde shook hands and said very earnestly and adoringlyI hope
to Heaven I shall never see your face again

And Mrs Haggert understood




WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE


 I closed and drew for my loves sake
 That now is false to me
 And I slew the Riever of Tarrant Moss
 And set Dumeny free

 And ever they give me praise and gold
 And ever I moan my loss
 For I struck the blow for my false loves sake
 And not for the men at the Moss

 Tarrant Moss


One of the many curses of our life out here is the want of atmosphere in
the painters sense There are no halftints worth noticing Men stand
out all crude and raw with nothing to tone them down and nothing to
scale them against They do their work and grow to think that there is
nothing but their work and nothing like their work and that they are
the real pivots on which the administration turns Here is an instance
of this feeling A halfcaste clerk was ruling forms in a Pay Office He
said to meDo you know what would happen if I added or took away one
single line on this sheet Then with the air of a conspiratorIt
would disorganize the whole of the Treasury payments throughout the
whole of the Presidency Circle Think of that

If men had not this delusion as to the ultraimportance of their own
particular employments I suppose that they would sit down and kill
themselves But their weakness is wearisome particularly when the
listener knows that he himself commits exactly the same sin

Even the Secretariat believes that it does good when it asks an
overdriven Executive Officer to take census of wheatweevils through a
district of five thousand square miles

There was a man once in the Foreign Officea man who had grown
middleaged in the department and was commonly said by irreverent
juniors to be able to repeat Aitchisons Treaties and Sunnuds
backwards in his sleep What he did with his stored knowledge only the
Secretary knew and he naturally would not publish the news abroad
This mans name was Wressley and it was the Shibboleth in those days
to sayWressley knows more about the Central Indian States than any
living man If you did not say this you were considered one of mean
understanding

Nowadays the man who says that he knows the ravel of the intertribal
complications across the Border is of more use but in Wressleys time
much attention was paid to the Central Indian States They were called
foci and factors and all manner of imposing names

And here the curse of AngloIndian life fell heavily When Wressley
lifted up his voice and spoke about suchandsuch a succession to
suchandsuch a throne the Foreign Office were silent and Heads
of Departments repeated the last two or three words of Wressleys
sentences and tacked yes yes on them and knew that they were
assisting the Empire to grapple with serious political contingencies
In most big undertakings one or two men do the work while the rest sit
near and talk till the ripe decorations begin to fall

Wressley was the workingmember of the Foreign Office firm and to keep
him up to his duties when he showed signs of flagging he was made
much of by his superiors and told what a fine fellow he was He did not
require coaxing because he was of tough build but what he received
confirmed him in the belief that there was no one quite so absolutely
and imperatively necessary to the stability of India as Wressley of the
Foreign Office There might be other good men but the known honored
and trusted man among men was Wressley of the Foreign Office We had a
Viceroy in those days who knew exactly when to gentle a fractious big
man and to hearten up a collargalled little one and so keep all his
team level He conveyed to Wressley the impression which I have just
set down and even tough men are apt to be disorganized by a Viceroys
praise There was a case oncebut that is another story

All India knew Wressleys name and officeit was in Thacker and Spinks
Directorybut who he was personally or what he did or what his
special merits were not fifty men knew or cared His work filled all
his time and he found no leisure to cultivate acquaintances beyond
those of dead Rajput chiefs with Ahir blots in their scutcheons
Wressley would have made a very good Clerk in the Heralds College had
he not been a Bengal Civilian

Upon a day between office and office great trouble came to
Wressleyoverwhelmed him knocked him down and left him gasping
as though he had been a little schoolboy Without reason against
prudence and at a moments notice he fell in love with a frivolous
goldenhaired girl who used to tear about Simla Mall on a high rough
waler with a blue velvet jockeycap crammed over her eyes Her name was
VennerTillie Vennerand she was delightful She took Wressleys heart
at a handgallop and Wressley found that it was not good for man to
live alone even with half the Foreign Office Records in his presses

Then Simla laughed for Wressley in love was slightly ridiculous He did
his best to interest the girl in himselfthat is to say his workand
she after the manner of women did her best to appear interested in
what behind his back she called Mr Wressleys Wajahs for she
lisped very prettily She did not understand one little thing about
them but she acted as if she did Men have married on that sort of
error before now

Providence however had care of Wressley He was immensely struck with
Miss Venners intelligence He would have been more impressed had
he heard her private and confidential accounts of his calls He held
peculiar notions as to the wooing of girls He said that the best work
of a mans career should be laid reverently at their feet Ruskin writes
something like this somewhere I think but in ordinary life a few
kisses are better and save time

About a month after he had lost his heart to Miss Venner and had been
doing his work vilely in consequence the first idea of his Native Rule
in Central India struck Wressley and filled him with joy It was as he
sketched it a great thingthe work of his lifea really comprehensive
survey of a most fascinating subjectto be written with all the special
and laboriously acquired knowledge of Wressley of the Foreign Officea
gift fit for an Empress

He told Miss Venner that he was going to take leave and hoped on his
return to bring her a present worthy of her acceptance Would she wait
Certainly she would Wressley drew seventeen hundred rupees a month She
would wait a year for that Her mamma would help her to wait

So Wressley took one years leave and all the available documents about
a truckload that he could lay hands on and went down to Central India
with his notion hot in his head He began his book in the land he was
writing of Too much official correspondence had made him a frigid
workman and he must have guessed that he needed the white light of
local color on his palette This is a dangerous paint for amateurs to
play with

Heavens how that man worked He caught his Rajahs analyzed his Rajahs
and traced them up into the mists of Time and beyond with their
queens and their concubines He dated and crossdated pedigreed and
triplepedigreed compared noted connoted wove strung sorted
selected inferred calendared and countercalendared for ten hours a
day And because this sudden and new light of Love was upon him he
turned those dry bones of history and dirty records of misdeeds into
things to weep or to laugh over as he pleased His heart and soul were
at the end of his pen and they got into the link He was dowered with
sympathy insight humor and style for two hundred and thirty days and
nights and his book was a Book He had his vast special knowledge with
him so to speak but the spirit the wovenin human Touch the poetry
and the power of the output were beyond all special knowledge But I
doubt whether he knew the gift that was in him then and thus he may
have lost some happiness He was toiling for Tillie Venner not for
himself Men often do their best work blind for some one elses sake

Also though this has nothing to do with the story in India where every
one knows every one else you can watch men being driven by the women
who govern them out of the rankandfile and sent to take up points
alone A good man once started goes forward but an average man so
soon as the woman loses interest in his success as a tribute to her
power comes back to the battalion and is no more heard of

Wressley bore the first copy of his book to Simla and blushing and
stammering presented it to Miss Venner She read a little of it I
give her review verbatimOh your book Its all about those howwid
Wajahs I didnt understand it

         

Wressley of the Foreign Office was broken smashedI am not
exaggeratingby this one frivolous little girl All that he could say
feebly wasBut but its my magnum opus The work of my life Miss
Venner did not know what magnum opus meant but she knew that Captain
Kerrington had won three races at the last Gymkhana Wressley didnt
press her to wait for him any longer He had sense enough for that

Then came the reaction after the years strain and Wressley went back
to the Foreign Office and his Wajahs a compiling gazetteering
reportwriting hack who would have been dear at three hundred rupees
a month He abided by Miss Venners review Which proves that the
inspiration in the book was purely temporary and unconnected with
himself Nevertheless he had no right to sink in a hilltarn five
packingcases brought up at enormous expense from Bombay of the best
book of Indian history ever written

When he sold off before retiring some years later I was turning over
his shelves and came across the only existing copy of Native Rule in
Central Indiathe copy that Miss Venner could not understand I read
it sitting on his muletrucks as long as the light lasted and offered
him his own price for it He looked over my shoulder for a few pages and
said to himself drearilyNow how in the world did I come to write
such damned good stuff as that Then to meTake it and keep
it Write one of your pennyfarthing yarns about its birth
Perhapsperhapsthe whole business may have been ordained to that
end

Which knowing what Wressley of the Foreign Office was once struck me
as about the bitterest thing that I had ever heard a man say of his own
work




BY WORD OF MOUTH


 Not though you die tonight O Sweet and wail
 A spectre at my door
 Shall mortal Fear make Love immortal fail
 I shall but love you more
 Who from Deaths house returning give me still
 One moments comfort in my matchless ill

 Shadow Houses


This tale may be explained by those who know how souls are made and
where the bounds of the Possible are put down I have lived long enough
in this country to know that it is best to know nothing and can only
write the story as it happened

Dumoise was our Civil Surgeon at Meridki and we called him Dormouse
because he was a round little sleepy little man He was a good
Doctor and never quarrelled with any one not even with our Deputy
Commissioner who had the manners of a bargee and the tact of a horse
He married a girl as round and as sleepylooking as himself She was
a Miss Hillardyce daughter of Squash Hillardyce of the Berars who
married his Chiefs daughter by mistake But that is another story

A honeymoon in India is seldom more than a week long but there is
nothing to hinder a couple from extending it over two or three years
This is a delightful country for married folk who are wrapped up in one
another They can live absolutely alone and without interruptionjust
as the Dormice did These two little people retired from the world after
their marriage and were very happy They were forced of course
to give occasional dinners but they made no friends hereby and the
Station went its own way and forgot them only saying occasionally
that Dormouse was the best of good fellows though dull A Civil Surgeon
who never quarrels is a rarity appreciated as such

Few people can afford to play Robinson Crusoe anywhereleast of all
in India where we are few in the land and very much dependent on each
others kind offices Dumoise was wrong in shutting himself from the
world for a year and he discovered his mistake when an epidemic of
typhoid broke out in the Station in the heart of the cold weather and
his wife went down He was a shy little man and five days were wasted
before he realized that Mrs Dumoise was burning with something worse
than simple fever and three days more passed before he ventured to call
on Mrs Shute the Engineers wife and timidly speak about his trouble
Nearly every household in India knows that Doctors are very helpless
in typhoid The battle must be fought out between Death and the Nurses
minute by minute and degree by degree Mrs Shute almost boxed Dumoises
ears for what she called his criminal delay and went off at once to
look after the poor girl We had seven cases of typhoid in the Station
that winter and as the average of death is about one in every five
cases we felt certain that we should have to lose somebody But all did
their best The women sat up nursing the women and the men turned
to and tended the bachelors who were down and we wrestled with those
typhoid cases for fiftysix days and brought them through the Valley of
the Shadow in triumph But just when we thought all was over and were
going to give a dance to celebrate the victory little Mrs Dumoise
got a relapse and died in a week and the Station went to the funeral
Dumoise broke down utterly at the brink of the grave and had to be
taken away

After the death Dumoise crept into his own house and refused to be
comforted He did his duties perfectly but we all felt that he should
go on leave and the other men of his own Service told him so Dumoise
was very thankful for the suggestionhe was thankful for anything in
those daysand went to Chini on a walkingtour Chini is some twenty
marches from Simla in the heart of the Hills and the scenery is good
if you are in trouble You pass through big still deodarforests and
under big still cliffs and over big still grassdowns swelling like
a womans breasts and the wind across the grass and the rain among the
deodars saysHushhushhush So little Dumoise was packed off to
Chini to wear down his grief with a fullplate camera and a rifle He
took also a useless bearer because the man had been his wifes favorite
servant He was idle and a thief but Dumoise trusted everything to him

On his way back from Chini Dumoise turned aside to Bagi through the
Forest Reserve which is on the spur of Mount Huttoo Some men who have
travelled more than a little say that the march from Kotegarh to Bagi is
one of the finest in creation It runs through dark wet forest and ends
suddenly in bleak nipped hillside and black rocks Bagi dakbungalow
is open to all the winds and is bitterly cold Few people go to Bagi
Perhaps that was the reason why Dumoise went there He halted at seven
in the evening and his bearer went down the hillside to the village
to engage coolies for the next days march The sun had set and the
nightwinds were beginning to croon among the rocks Dumoise leaned on
the railing of the verandah waiting for his bearer to return The man
came back almost immediately after he had disappeared and at such a
rate that Dumoise fancied he must have crossed a bear He was running as
hard as he could up the face of the hill

But there was no bear to account for his terror He raced to the
verandah and fell down the blood spurting from his nose and his face
irongray Then he gurgledI have seen the Memsahib I have seen the
Memsahib

Where said Dumoise

Down there walking on the road to the village She was in a blue
dress and she lifted the veil of her bonnet and saidRam Dass give
my salaams to the Sahib and tell him that I shall meet him next month
at Nuddea Then I ran away because I was afraid

What Dumoise said or did I do not know Ram Dass declares that he said
nothing but walked up and down the verandah all the cold night waiting
for the Memsahib to come up the hill and stretching out his arms into
the dark like a madman But no Memsahib came and next day he went on
to Simla crossquestioning the bearer every hour

Ram Dass could only say that he had met Mrs Dumoise and that she had
lifted up her veil and given him the message which he had faithfully
repeated to Dumoise To this statement Ram Dass adhered He did not know
where Nuddea was had no friends at Nuddea and would most certainly
never go to Nuddea even though his pay were doubled

Nuddea is in Bengal and has nothing whatever to do with a doctor
serving in the Punjab It must be more than twelve hundred miles from
Meridki

Dumoise went through Simla without halting and returned to Meridki
there to take over charge from the man who had been officiating for him
during his tour There were some Dispensary accounts to be explained
and some recent orders of the SurgeonGeneral to be noted and
altogether the takingover was a full days work In the evening
Dumoise told his locum tenens who was an old friend of his bachelor
days what had happened at Bagi and the man said that Ram Dass might as
well have chosen Tuticorin while he was about it

At that moment a telegraphpeon came in with a telegram from Simla
ordering Dumoise not to take over charge at Meridki but to go at once
to Nuddea on special duty There was a nasty outbreak of cholera at
Nuddea and the Bengal Government being shorthanded as usual had
borrowed a Surgeon from the Punjab

Dumoise threw the telegram across the table and saidWell

The other Doctor said nothing It was all that he could say

Then he remembered that Dumoise had passed through Simla on his way
from Bagi and thus might possibly have heard the first news of the
impending transfer

He tried to put the question and the implied suspicion into words but
Dumoise stopped him withIf I had desired THAT I should never have
come back from Chini I was shooting there I wish to live for I have
things to do but I shall not be sorry

The other man bowed his head and helped in the twilight to pack up
Dumoises just opened trunks Ram Dass entered with the lamps

Where is the Sahib going he asked

To Nuddea said Dumoise softly

Ram Dass clawed Dumoises knees and boots and begged him not to go Ram
Dass wept and howled till he was turned out of the room Then he wrapped
up all his belongings and came back to ask for a character He was not
going to Nuddea to see his Sahib die and perhaps to die himself

So Dumoise gave the man his wages and went down to Nuddea alone the
other Doctor bidding him goodbye as one under sentence of death

Eleven days later he had joined his Memsahib and the Bengal Government
had to borrow a fresh Doctor to cope with that epidemic at Nuddea The
first importation lay dead in Chooadanga DakBungalow




TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE


 By the hoof of the Wild Goat uptossed
 From the Cliff where She lay in the Sun
 Fell the Stone
 To the Tarn where the daylight is lost
 So She fell from the light of the Sun
 And alone

 Now the fall was ordained from the first
 With the Goat and the Cliff and the Tarn
 But the Stone
 Knows only Her life is accursed
 As She sinks in the depths of the Tarn
 And alone

 Oh Thou who has builded the world
 Oh Thou who hast lighted the Sun
 Oh Thou who hast darkened the Tarn
 Judge Thou
 The Sin of the Stone that was hurled
 By the Goat from the light of the Sun
 As She sinks in the mire of the Tarn
 Even noweven noweven now

 From the Unpublished Papers of McIntosh Jellaludin


 Say is it dawn is it dusk in thy Bower
 Thou whom I long for who longest for me
 Oh be it nightbe it


Here he fell over a little camelcolt that was sleeping in the Serai
where the horsetraders and the best of the blackguards from Central
Asia live and because he was very drunk indeed and the night was dark
he could not rise again till I helped him That was the beginning of my
acquaintance with McIntosh Jellaludin When a loafer and drunk sings
The Song of the Bower he must be worth cultivating He got off the
camels back and said rather thicklyIIIm a bit screwed but a
dip in Loggerhead will put me right again and I say have you spoken to
Symonds about the mares knees

Now Loggerhead was six thousand weary miles away from us close to
Mesopotamia where you mustnt fish and poaching is impossible and
Charley Symonds stable a half mile further across the paddocks It was
strange to hear all the old names on a May night among the horses
and camels of the Sultan Caravanserai Then the man seemed to remember
himself and sober down at the same time He leaned against the camel and
pointed to a corner of the Serai where a lamp was burning

I live there said he and I should be extremely obliged if you would
be good enough to help my mutinous feet thither for I am more than
usually drunkmostmost phenomenally tight But not in respect to my
head My brain cries out againsthow does it go But my head rides on
therolls on the dunghill I should have said and controls the qualm

I helped him through the gangs of tethered horses and he collapsed on
the edge of the verandah in front of the line of native quarters

Thanksa thousand thanks O Moon and little little Stars To think
that a man should so shamelessly Infamous liquor too Ovid in exile
drank no worse Better It was frozen Alas I had no ice Goodnight I
would introduce you to my wife were I soberor she civilized

A native woman came out of the darkness of the room and began calling
the man names so I went away He was the most interesting loafer that
I had the pleasure of knowing for a long time and later on he became
a friend of mine He was a tall wellbuilt fair man fearfully shaken
with drink and he looked nearer fifty than the thirtyfive which he
said was his real age When a man begins to sink in India and is not
sent Home by his friends as soon as may be he falls very low from a
respectable point of view By the time that he changes his creed as did
McIntosh he is past redemption

In most big cities natives will tell you of two or three Sahibs
generally lowcaste who have turned Hindu or Mussulman and who live
more or less as such But it is not often that you can get to know
them As McIntosh himself used to sayIf I change my religion for my
stomachs sake I do not seek to become a martyr to missionaries nor am
I anxious for notoriety

At the outset of acquaintance McIntosh warned me Remember this I am
not an object for charity I require neither your money your food
nor your castoff raiment I am that rare animal a selfsupporting
drunkard If you choose I will smoke with you for the tobacco of the
bazars does not I admit suit my palate and I will borrow any books
which you may not specially value It is more than likely that I shall
sell them for bottles of excessively filthy countryliquors In return
you shall share such hospitality as my house affords Here is a charpoy
on which two can sit and it is possible that there may from time to
time be food in that platter Drink unfortunately you will find on
the premises at any hour and thus I make you welcome to all my poor
establishments

I was admitted to the McIntosh householdI and my good tobacco But
nothing else Unluckily one cannot visit a loafer in the Serai by
day Friends buying horses would not understand it Consequently I
was obliged to see McIntosh after dark He laughed at this and said
simplyYou are perfectly right When I enjoyed a position in society
rather higher than yours I should have done exactly the same thing
Good Heavens I was oncehe spoke as though he had fallen from the
Command of a Regimentan Oxford Man This accounted for the reference
to Charley Symonds stable

You said McIntosh slowly have not had that advantage but to
outward appearance you do not seem possessed of a craving for strong
drinks On the whole I fancy that you are the luckier of the two Yet
I am not certain You areforgive my saying so even while I am smoking
your excellent tobaccopainfully ignorant of many things

We were sitting together on the edge of his bedstead for he owned
no chairs watching the horses being watered for the night while the
native woman was preparing dinner I did not like being patronized by a
loafer but I was his guest for the time being though he owned only one
very torn alpacacoat and a pair of trousers made out of gunnybags
He took the pipe out of his mouth and went on judiciallyAll things
considered I doubt whether you are the luckier I do not refer to
your extremely limited classical attainments or your excruciating
quantities but to your gross ignorance of matters more immediately
under your notice That for instanceHe pointed to a woman cleaning
a samovar near the well in the centre of the Serai She was flicking the
water out of the spout in regular cadenced jerks

There are ways and ways of cleaning samovars If you knew why she
was doing her work in that particular fashion you would know what the
Spanish Monk meant when he said

 I the Trinity illustrate
 Drinking watered orangepulp
 In three sips the Aryan frustrate
 While he drains his at one gulp


and many other things which now are hidden from your eyes However Mrs
McIntosh has prepared dinner Let us come and eat after the fashion of
the people of the countryof whom by the way you know nothing

The native woman dipped her hand in the dish with us This was wrong
The wife should always wait until the husband has eaten McIntosh
Jellaludin apologized saying

It is an English prejudice which I have not been able to overcome and
she loves me Why I have never been able to understand I foregathered
with her at Jullundur three years ago and she has remained with me
ever since I believe her to be moral and know her to be skilled in
cookery

He patted the womans head as he spoke and she cooed softly She was
not pretty to look at

McIntosh never told me what position he had held before his fall He
was when sober a scholar and a gentleman When drunk he was rather
more of the first than the second He used to get drunk about once a
week for two days On those occasions the native woman tended him
while he raved in all tongues except his own One day indeed he began
reciting Atalanta in Calydon and went through it to the end beating
time to the swing of the verse with a bedsteadleg But he did most of
his ravings in Greek or German The mans mind was a perfect ragbag
of useless things Once when he was beginning to get sober he told
me that I was the only rational being in the Inferno into which he had
descendeda Virgil in the Shades he saidand that in return for
my tobacco he would before he died give me the materials of a new
Inferno that should make me greater than Dante Then he fell asleep on a
horseblanket and woke up quite calm

Man said he when you have reached the uttermost depths of
degradation little incidents which would vex a higher life are to you
of no consequence Last night my soul was among the gods but I make no
doubt that my bestial body was writhing down here in the garbage

You were abominably drunk if thats what you mean I said

I WAS drunkfilthy drunk I who am the son of a man with whom you have
no concernI who was once Fellow of a College whose butteryhatch you
have not seen I was loathsomely drunk But consider how lightly I am
touched It is nothing to me Less than nothing for I do not even feel
the headache which should be my portion Now in a higher life how
ghastly would have been my punishment how bitter my repentance Believe
me my friend with the neglected education the highest is as the
lowestalways supposing each degree extreme

He turned round on the blanket put his head between his fists and
continued

On the Soul which I have lost and on the Conscience which I have
killed I tell you that I CANNOT feel I am as the gods knowing good
and evil but untouched by either Is this enviable or is it not

When a man has lost the warning of next mornings head he must be in
a bad state I answered looking at McIntosh on the blanket with his
hair over his eyes and his lips bluewhite that I did not think the
insensibility good enough

For pitys sake dont say that I tell you it IS good and most
enviable Think of my consolations

Have you so many then McIntosh

Certainly your attempts at sarcasm which is essentially the weapon
of a cultured man are crude First my attainments my classical and
literary knowledge blurred perhaps by immoderate drinkingwhich
reminds me that before my soul went to the Gods last night I sold the
Pickering Horace you so kindly lent me Ditta Mull the Clothesman has
it It fetched ten annas and may be redeemed for a rupeebut still
infinitely superior to yours Secondly the abiding affection of Mrs
McIntosh best of wives Thirdly a monument more enduring than brass
which I have built up in the seven years of my degradation

He stopped here and crawled across the room for a drink of water He
was very shaky and sick

He referred several times to his treasuresome great possession that
he ownedbut I held this to be the raving of drink He was as poor and
as proud as he could be His manner was not pleasant but he knew enough
about the natives among whom seven years of his life had been spent
to make his acquaintance worth having He used actually to laugh at
Strickland as an ignorant manignorant West and Easthe said His
boast was first that he was an Oxford Man of rare and shining parts
which may or may not have been trueI did not know enough to check his
statementsand secondly that he had his hand on the pulse of native
lifewhich was a fact As an Oxford man he struck me as a prig he
was always throwing his education about As a Mahommedan faquiras
McIntosh Jellaludinhe was all that I wanted for my own ends He smoked
several pounds of my tobacco and taught me several ounces of things
worth knowing but he would never accept any gifts not even when the
cold weather came and gripped the poor thin chest under the poor thin
alpacacoat He grew very angry and said that I had insulted him and
that he was not going into hospital He had lived like a beast and he
would die rationally like a man

As a matter of fact he died of pneumonia and on the night of his death
sent over a grubby note asking me to come and help him to die

The native woman was weeping by the side of the bed McIntosh wrapped
in a cotton cloth was too weak to resent a fur coat being thrown over
him He was very active as far as his mind was concerned and his eyes
were blazing When he had abused the Doctor who came with me so foully
that the indignant old fellow left he cursed me for a few minutes and
calmed down

Then he told his wife to fetch out The Book from a hole in the wall
She brought out a big bundle wrapped in the tail of a petticoat of old
sheets of miscellaneous notepaper all numbered and covered with fine
cramped writing McIntosh ploughed his hand through the rubbish and
stirred it up lovingly

This he said is my workthe Book of McIntosh Jellaludin showing
what he saw and how he lived and what befell him and others being also
an account of the life and sins and death of Mother Maturin What Mirza
Murad Ali Begs book is to all other books on native life will my work
be to Mirza Murad Ali Begs

This as will be conceded by any one who knows Mirza Ali Begs book was
a sweeping statement The papers did not look specially valuable but
McIntosh handled them as if they were currencynotes Then he said
slowlyIn despite the many weaknesses of your education you have
been good to me I will speak of your tobacco when I reach the Gods I
owe you much thanks for many kindnesses But I abominate indebtedness
For this reason I bequeath to you now the monument more enduring than
brassmy one bookrude and imperfect in parts but oh how rare in
others I wonder if you will understand it It is a gift more honorable
than Bah where is my brain rambling to You will mutilate it
horribly You will knock out the gems you call Latin quotations you
Philistine and you will butcher the style to carve into your own jerky
jargon but you cannot destroy the whole of it I bequeath it to you
Ethel My brain again Mrs McIntosh bear witness that I give the
sahib all these papers They would be of no use to you Heart of my
heart and I lay it upon you he turned to me here that you do not
let my book die in its present form It is yours unconditionallythe
story of McIntosh Jellaludin which is NOT the story of McIntosh
Jellaludin but of a greater man than he and of a far greater woman
Listen now I am neither mad nor drunk That book will make you famous

I said thank you as the native woman put the bundle into my arms

My only baby said McIntosh with a smile He was sinking fast but
he continued to talk as long as breath remained I waited for the
end knowing that in six cases out of ten the dying man calls for his
mother He turned on his side and said

Say how it came into your possession No one will believe you but my
name at least will live You will treat it brutally I know you will
Some of it must go the public are fools and prudish fools I was their
servant once But do your mangling gentlyvery gently It is a great
work and I have paid for it in seven years damnation

His voice stopped for ten or twelve breaths and then he began mumbling
a prayer of some kind in Greek The native woman cried very bitterly
Lastly he rose in bed and said as loudly as slowlyNot guilty my
Lord

Then he fell back and the stupor held him till he died The native
woman ran into the Serai among the horses and screamed and beat her
breasts for she had loved him

Perhaps his last sentence in life told what McIntosh had once gone
through but saving the big bundle of old sheets in the cloth there
was nothing in his room to say who or what he had been

The papers were in a hopeless muddle

Strickland helped me to sort them and he said that the writer was
either an extreme liar or a most wonderful person He thought the
former One of these days you may be able to judge for yourself The
bundle needed much expurgation and was full of Greek nonsense at the
head of the chapters which has all been cut out

If the things are ever published some one may perhaps remember this
story now printed as a safeguard to prove that McIntosh Jellaludin and
not I myself wrote the Book of Mother Maturin

I dont want the Giants Robe to come true in my case
