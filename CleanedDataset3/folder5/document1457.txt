CHAPTER I POTVALIANCE

Then drink it thus cried the rash young fool and splashed the contents
of his cup full into the face of Mr Wilding even as that gentleman on
his feet was proposing to drink to the eyes of the young fools sister

The moments that followed were full of interest A stillness a
brooding expectant stillness fell upon the companyand it numbered
a round dozenabout Lord Gervases richly appointed board In the soft
candlelight the oval table shone like a deep brown pool in which were
reflected the gleaming silver and sparkling crystal that seemed to float
upon it

Blake sucked in his netherlip his florid face a thought less florid
than its wont his prominent blue eyes a thought more prominent Under
its golden periwig old Nick Trenchards wizened countenance was darkened
by a scowl and his fingers long swarthy and gnarled drummed
fretfully upon the table Portly Lord Gervase Scoresbytheir host a
benign and placid man of peace detesting turbulenceturned crimson now
in wordless rage The others gaped and staredsome at young Westmacott
some at the man he had so grossly affrontedwhilst in the shadows of
the hall a couple of lacqueys looked on amazed all teeth and eyes

Mr Wilding stood very still and outwardly impassive the wine
trickling from his long face which if pale was no paler than its
habit a vestige of the smile with which he had proposed the toast still
lingering on his thin lips though departed from his eyes An elegant
gentleman was Mr Wilding tall and seeming even taller by virtue of
his exceeding slenderness He had the courage to wear his own hair
which was of a dark brown and very luxuriant dark brown too were his
sombre eyes lowlidded and set at a downward slant From those odd eyes
of his his countenance gathered an air of superciliousness tempered by
a gentle melancholy For the rest it was scored by lines that stamped
it with the appearance of an age in excess of his thirty years

Thirty guineas worth of Mechlin at his throat was drenched empurpled
and ruined beyond redemption and on the breast of his blue satin coat a
dark patch was spreading like a stain of blood

Richard Westmacott short sturdy and faircomplexioned to the point
of insipidity watched him sullenly out of pale eyes and waited It
was Lord Gervase who broke at last the silencebroke it with an oath a
thing unusual in one whose nature was almost womanmild

As Gods my life he spluttered wrathfully glowering at Richard To
have this happen in my house The young fool shall make apology

With his dying breath sneered Trenchard and the old rakes words
his tone and the malevolent look he bent upon the boy increased the
companys malaise

I think said Mr Wilding with a most singular and excessive
sweetness that what Mr Westmacott has done he has done because he
apprehended me amiss

No doubt hell say so opined Trenchard with a shrug and had caution
dug into his ribs by Blakes elbow whilst Richard made haste to prove
him wrong by saying the contrary

I apprehended you exactly sir he answered defiance in his voice and
wineflushed face

Ha clucked Trenchard irrepressible Hes bent on selfdestruction
Let him have his way in Gods name

But Wilding seemed intent upon showing how longsuffering he could
be He gently shook his head Nay now said he You thought Mr
Westmacott that in mentioning your sister I did so lightly Is it not
so

You mentioned her and that is all that matters cried Westmacott
Ill not have her name on your lips at any time or in any placeno
nor in any manner His speech was thick from too much wine

You are drunk cried indignant Lord Gervase with finality

Potvaliant Trenchard elaborated

Mr Wilding set down at last the glass which he had continued to
hold until that moment He rested his hands upon the table knuckles
downward and leaning forward he spoke impressively his face very
grave and those presentknowing him as they didwere one and all lost
in wonder at his unusual patience

Mr Westmacott said he I do think you are wrong to persist in
affronting me You have done a thing that is beyond forgiveness and
yet when I offer you this opportunity of honourably retrieving He
shrugged his shoulders leaving the sentence incomplete

The company might have spared its deep surprise at so much mildness
There was but the semblance of it Wilding proceeded thus of purpose
set and under the calm mask of his long white face his mind worked
wickedly and deliberately The temerity of Westmacott whose nature was
notoriously timid had surprised him for a moment But anon reading the
boys mind as readily as though it had been a scroll unfolded for his
instruction he saw that Westmacott on the strength of his position
as his sisters brother conceived himself immune Mr Wildings avowed
courtship of the lady the hopes he still entertained of winning her
despite the aversion she was at pains to show him gave Westmacott
assurance that Mr Wilding would never elect to shatter his all too
slender chances by embroiling himself in a quarrel with her brother
Andreading him thus arightMr Wilding put on that mask of
patience luring the boy into greater conviction of the security of
his position And Richard conceiving himself safe in his entrenchment
behind the bulwarks of his brothership to Ruth Westmacott and heartened
further by the excess of wine he had consumed persisted in insults he
would never otherwise have dared to offer

Who seeks to retrieve he crowed offensively boldly looking up into
the others face It seems you are yourself reluctant And he laughed
a trifle stridently and looked about him for applause but found none

You are overrash Lord Gervase disapproved him harshly

Not the first coward Ive seen grow valiant at a table put in
Trenchard by way of explanation and might have come to words with Blake
on that same score but that in that moment Wilding spoke again

Reluctant to do what he questioned amiably looking Westmacott
so straightly between the eyes that the boy shifted uneasily on his
highbacked chair

Nevertheless still full of confidence in the unassailability of his
position the mad youth answered To cleanse yourself of what I threw
at you

Fan me ye winds gasped Nick Trenchard and looked with expectancy at
his friend Wilding

Now there was one factor with which in basing with such craven
shrewdness his calculations upon Mr Wildings feelings for his sister
young Richard had not reckoned He was not to know that Wilding
bruised and wounded by Miss Westmacotts scorn of him had reached that
borderland where love and hate are so merged that they are scarce to be
distinguished Embittered by the slights she had put upon himslights
which his sensitive lovers fancy had magnified a hundredfoldAnthony
Wildings frame of mind was grown peculiar Of his love she would have
none his kindness she seemingly despised So be it she should taste
his cruelty If she scorned his wooing and forbade him to pursue it at
least it was not hers to deny him the power to hurt and in hurting
her that would not be loved by him some measure of fierce and bitter
consolation seemed to await him

He realized perhaps not quite all thisand to the unworthiness of it
all he gave no thought But he realized enough as he toyed as cat with
mouse with Richard Westmacott to know that in striking at her through
the worthless person of this brother whom she cherishedand who
persisted in affording him this opportunitya wicked vengeance would be
his

Peaceloving Lord Gervase had heaved himself suddenly to his feet at
Westmacotts last words still intent upon saving the situation

In Heavens name he began when Mr Wilding ever calm and smiling
though now a trifle sinister waved him gently into silence But that
persisting calm of Mr Wildings was too much for old Nick Trenchard He
rose abruptly drawing all eyes upon himself It was time he thought
he took a hand in this

In addition to his affection for Wilding and his contempt for
Westmacott he was filled with a fear that the latter might become
dangerous if not crushed at once Gifted with a shrewd knowledge of
men acquired during a chequered life of much sour experience old
Nick instinctively mistrusted Richard He had known him for a fool
a weakling a babbler and a bibber of wine Out of such elements a
villain is soon compounded and Trenchard had cause to fear the form
of villainy that lay ready to Richards hand For it chanced that Mr
Trenchard was second cousin to that famous John Trenchard so lately
tried for treason and acquitted to the great joy of the sectaries of the
West and still more latelybut yesterday in factfled the country to
escape the rearrest ordered in consequence of that excessive joy Like
his more famous cousin Nick Trenchard was one of the Duke of Monmouths
most active agents and Westmacott like Wilding Vallancey and one
or two others at that board stood too committed to the cause of the
Protestant Champion

Out of his knowledge of the boy Trenchard was led to fear that if he
were leniently dealt with now tomorrow when sober he came to realize
the grossness of the thing he had done and the unlikelihood of its being
forgiven him there was no saying but that to protect himself he might
betray Wildings share in the plot that was being hatched That in
itself would be bad enough but there might be worse for he could
scarcely betray Wilding without betraying others andwhat mattered
mostthe Cause itself He must be dealt with out of hand Trenchard
opined and dealt with ruthlessly

I think Anthony said he that we have had words enough Shall you
be disposing of Mr Westmacott tomorrow or must I be doing it for
you

With a gasp of dismay young Richard twisted in his chair to confront
this fresh and unsuspected antagonist What danger was this that he had
overlooked Then even as he turned Wildings voice fell on his ear
and each word of the few he spoke was like a drop of icy water on
Westmacotts overheated brain

I protest you are vastly kind Nick But I intend myself to have the
pleasure of killing Mr Westmacott And his smile fell now in mockery
upon the disillusioned lad

Crushed by that bolt from the blue Richard sat as if stunned the flush
receding from his face until his very lips were livid The shock had
sobered him and sobered he realized in terror what he had done And
yet even sober he was amazed to find that the staff upon which with such
security he had leaned should have proved rotten True he had put much
strain upon it but then he had counted that it would stand much strain

He would have spoken but he lacked words so stricken was he And even
had he done so it is odds none would have heard him for the late calm
was of a sudden turned to garboil Every man of that companywith
the sole exception of Richard himselfwas on his feet and all were
speaking at once in clamouring excited chorus

Wilding alonethe butt of their expostulationsstood quietly smiling
and wiped his face at last with a kerchief of finest lawn Dominating
the others in the Babel rose the voice of Sir Rowland Blakeimpecunious
Blake Blake lately of the Guards who had sold his commission as the
only thing remaining him upon which he could raise money Blake that
other suitor for Miss Westmacotts hand the suitor favoured by her
brother

You shall not do it Mr Wilding he shouted his face crimson No
by God You were shamed forever He is but a lad and drunk

Trenchard eyed the short powerfully built man beside him and laughed
unpleasantly You should get yourself bled one of these days Sir
Rowland he advised There may be no great danger yet but a man cant
be too careful when he wears a narrow neckcloth

Blakea short powerfully built mantook no heed of him but looked
straight at Mr Wilding who smiling ever calmly returned the gaze of
those prominent blue eyes

You will suffer me Sir Rowland said he sweetly to be the judge of
whom I will and whom I will not meet

Sir Rowland flushed under that mocking glance and caustic tone But he
is drunk he repeated feebly

I think said Trenchard that he is hearing something that will make
him sober

Lord Gervase took the lad by the shoulder and shook him impatiently
Well quoth he Have you nothing to say You did a deal of prating
just now I make no doubt but that even at this late hour if you were to
make apology

It would be idle came Wildings icy voice to quench the gleam of hope
kindling anew in Richards breast The lad saw that he was lost and he
is a poor thing indeed who cannot face the worst once that worst is
shown to be irrevocable He rose with some semblance of dignity

It is as I would wish said he but his livid face and staring eyes
belied the valour of his words He cleared his huskiness from his
throat Sir Rowland said he will you act for me

Not I cried Blake with an oath Ill be no party to the butchery of
a boy unfledged

Unfledged echoed Trenchard Body o me Tis a matter Wilding will
amend tomorrow Hell fledge him never fear Hell wing him on his
flight to heaven

Of set purpose did Trenchard add this fuel to the blazing fire It was
no part of his views that this encounter should be avoided If Richard
Westmacott were allowed to live after what had passed there were too
many tall fellows might go in peril of their lives

Richard meanwhile had turned to the man on his leftyoung Vallancey
a notorious partisan of the Duke of Monmouths a hairbrained gentleman
who was his own worst enemy

May I count on you Ned he asked

Ayeto the death said Vallancey magniloquently

Mr Vallancey said Trenchard with a wry twist of his sharp features
you grow prophetic






CHAPTER II SIR ROWLAND TO THE RESCUE

From Scoresby Hall near Weston Zoyland young Westmacott rode home that
Saturday night to his sisters house in Bridgwater a sobered man and an
anguished He had committed a folly which was like to cost him his life
tomorrow Other follies had he committed in his twentyfive yearsfor
he was not quite the babe that Blake had represented him although he
certainly looked nothing like his age But tonight he had contrived to
set the crown to all He had good cause to blame himself and to curse
the miscalculation that had emboldened him to launch himself upon
a course of insult against this Wilding whom he hated with all the
currish and resentful hatred of the worthless for the man of parts

But there was more than hate in the affront that he had offered
there was calculationto an even greater extent than we have seen It
happened that through his own fault young Richard was all but penniless
The pious nonconformist soul of Sir Geoffrey Luptonthe wealthy uncle
from whom he had had great expectationshad been so stirred to anger by
Richards vicious and besotted ways that he had left every guinea that
was his every perch of land and every brick of edifice to Richards
halfsister Ruth At present things were not so bad for the worthless
boy Ruth worshipped him He was a sacred charge to her from their dead
father who knowing the stoutness of her soul and the feebleness of
Richards had in dying imposed on her the care and guidance of her
graceless brother But Ruth in all things strong was weak with Richard
out of her very fondness for him To what she had he might help himself
and thus it was that things were not so bad with him at present But
when Richards calculating mind came to give thought to the future he
found that this occasioned him some care Rich ladies even when they
do not happen to be equipped in addition with Ruths winsome beauty and
endearing nature are not wont to go unmarried It would have pleased
Richard best to have had her remain a spinster But he well knew that
this was a matter in which she might have a voice of her own and it
behoved him betimes to take wise measures where possible husbands were
concerned

The first that came in a suitors obvious panoply was Anthony Wilding
of Zoyland Chase and Richard watched his advent with foreboding
Wildings was a personality to dazzle any woman despiteperhaps even
because ofthe reputation for wildness that clung to him That he was
known as Wild Wilding to the countryside is true but it were unfairas
Richard knewto attach to this too much importance for the adoption
of so obvious an alliteration the rude country minds needed but a slight
encouragement From the first it looked as if Ruth might favour him and
Richards fears assumed more definite shape If Wilding married herand
he was a bold masterful fellow who usually accomplished what he aimed
ather fortune and estate must cease to be a pleasant pasture land for
bovine Richard The boy thought at first of making terms with Wilding
the idea was old it had come to him when first he had counted the
chances of his sisters marrying But he found himself hesitating to
lay his proposal before Mr Wilding And whilst he hesitated Mr
Wilding made obvious headway Still Richard dared not do it There was
a something in Wildings eye that cried him danger Thus in the end
since he could not attempt a compromise with this fine fellow the only
course remaining was that of direct antagonismthat is to say direct
as Richard understood directness Slander was the weapon he used in
that secret duel the countryside was well stocked with stories of Mr
Wildings many indiscretions I do not wish to suggest that these were
unfounded Still the countryside cajoled by its primitive sense of
humour into that alliteration I have mentioned found that having given
this dog its bad name it was under the obligation of keeping up his
reputation So it exaggerated Richard exaggerating those exaggerations
in his turn had some details as interesting and unsavoury as they were
in the main untrue to lay before his sister

Now established love it is well known thrives wondrously on slander
The robust growth of a maids feelings for her accepted suitor is but
further strengthened by malign representations of his character She
seizes with joy the chance of affording proof of her great loyalty and
defies the world and its evil to convince her that the man to whom she
has given her trust is not most worthy of it Not so however with the
first timid bud of incipient interest Slander nips it like a frost in
deadliness it is second only to ridicule

Ruth Westmacott lent an ear to her brothers stories incredulous only
until she remembered vague hints she had caught from this person and
from that whose meaning was now made clear by what Richard told her
which incidentally they served to corroborate Corroboration too did
the tale of infamy receive from the friendship that prevailed between
Mr Wilding and Nick Trenchard the old neerdowell who in his
timeas everybody knewhad come so low despite his gentle birth as
to have been one of a company of strolling players Had Mr Wilding
been other than she now learnt he was he would surely not cherish an
attachment for a person so utterly unworthy Clearly they were birds of
a plumage

And so her maiden purity outraged at the thought that she had been in
danger of lending a willing ear to the wooing of such a man she
had crushed this love which she blushed to think was on the point of
throwing out roots to fasten on her soul and was sedulous thereafter in
manifesting the aversion which she accounted it her duty to foster for
Mr Wilding

Richard had watched and smiled in secret taking pride in the cunning
way he had wrought this changethat cunning which so often is given
to the stupid by way of compensation for the intelligence that has been
withheld them

And now what time discountenanced Wilding fumed and fretted all in
vain Sir Rowland Blake fresh from London and in full flight from his
creditors flashed like a comet into the Bridgwater heavens He dazzled
the eyes and might have had for the asking the heart and hand of Diana
HortonRuths cousin Her heart indeed he had without the asking for
Diana fell straightway in love with him and showed it just as he showed
that he was not without response to her affection There were some
tender passages between them but Blake for all his fine exterior was
a beggar and Diana far from rich and so he rode his feelings with
a hard grip upon the reins And then in an evil hour for poor Diana
young Westmacott had taken him to Lupton House and Sir Rowland had his
first glimpse of Ruth his first knowledge of her fortune He went down
before Ruths eyes like a man of heart he went down more lowly still
before her possessions like a man of greed and poor Diana might console
herself with whom she could

Her brother watched him appraised him and thought that in this broken
gamester he had a man after his own heart a man who would be ready
enough for such a bargain as Richard had in mind ready enough to
sell what rags might be left him of his honour so that he came by the
wherewithal to mend his broken fortunes

The twain made terms They haggled like any pair of traders out of
Jewry but in the end it was settledby a bond duly engrossed and
sealedthat on the day that Sir Rowland married Ruth he should make
over to her brother certain values that amounted to perhaps a quarter of
her possessions There was no cause to think that Ruth would be greatly
opposed to thisnot that that consideration would have weighed with
Richard

But now that all essentials were so satisfactorily determined a vexation
was offered Westmacott by the circumstance that his sister seemed nowise
taken with Sir Rowland She suffered him because he was her brothers
friend on that account she even honoured him with some measure of her
own friendship but to no greater intimacy did her manner promise to
admit him And meanwhile Mr Wilding persisted in the face of all
rebuffs Under his smiling mask he hid the smart of the wounds she dealt
him until it almost seemed to him that from loving her he had come to
hate her

It had been well for Richard had he left things as they were and waited
Whether Blake prospered or not leastways it was clear that Wilding
would not prosper and that for the season was all that need have
mattered to young Richard

But in his cups that night he had thought in some dim way to precipitate
matters by affronting Mr Wilding secure as I have shown in his
belief that Wilding would perish sooner than raise a finger against
Ruths brother And his drunken astuteness it seemed had been to
his mind as a piece of bottle glass to the sight distorting the image
viewed through it

With some such bitter reflection rode he home to his sleepless couch
Some part of those dark hours he spent in bitter reviling of Wilding of
himself and even of his sister whom he blamed for this awful situation
into which he had tumbled at other times he wept from selfpity and
sheer fright

Once indeed he imagined that he saw light that he saw a way out
of the peril that hemmed him in His mind turned for a moment in the
direction that Trenchard had feared it might He bethought him of his
association with the Monmouth Causeinto which he had been beguiled by
the sordid hope of gainand of Wildings important share in that same
business He was even moved to rise and ride that very night for Exeter
to betray to Albemarle the Cause itself so that he might have Wilding
laid by the heels But if Trenchard had been right in having little
faith in Richards loyalty he had it seems in fearing treachery
made the mistake of giving Richard credit for more courage than was his
endowment For when sitting up in bed fired by his inspiration young
Westmacott came to consider the questions the LordLieutenant of Devon
would be likely to ask him he reflected that the answers he must return
would so incriminate himself that he would be risking his own neck in
the betrayal He flung himself down again with a curse and a groan and
thought no more of the salvation that might lie for him that way

The morning of that last day of May found him pale and limp and all
atremble He rose betimes and dressed but stirred not from his chamber
till in the garden under his window he heard his sisters voice and
that of Diana Horton joined anon by a mans deeper tones which he
recognized with a start as Blakes What did the baronet here so
early Assuredly it must concern the impending duel Richard knew no
mawkishness on the score of eavesdropping He stole to his window and
lent an ear but the voices were receding and to his vexation he caught
nothing of what was said He wondered how soon Vallancey would come and
for what hour the encounter had been appointed Vallancey had remained
behind at Scoresby Hall last night to make the necessary arrangements
with Trenchard who was to act for Mr Wilding

Now it chanced that Trenchard and Wilding had businessbusiness of
Monmouthsto transact in Taunton that morning business which might
not be delayed There were odd rumours afloat in the West persistent
rumours which had come fast upon the heels of the news of Argyles
landing in Scotland rumours which maintained that Monmouth himself was
coming over from Holland These tales Wilding and his associates had
ignored The Duke they knew was to spend the summer in retreat in
Sweden with it was alleged the Lady Henrietta Wentworth to bear him
company and in the mean time his trusted agents were to pave the way
for his coming in the following spring Of late the lack of direct news
from the Duke had been a source of mystification to his friends in the
West and now suddenly the information went abroadit was something
more than rumour this timethat a letter of the greatest importance
had been intercepted From whom that letter proceeded or to whom it was
addressed could not yet be discovered But it seemed clear that it
was connected with the Monmouth Cause and it behoved Mr Wilding to
discover what he could With this intent he rode with Trenchard that
Sunday morning to Taunton hoping that at the Red Lion Innthat
meetingplace of dissentershe might cull reliable information

It was in consequence of this that the meeting with Richard Westmacott
was not to take place until the evening and therefore Vallancey came
not to Lupton House as early as Richard thought he should expect him
Blake howevermore no doubt out of a selfish fear of losing a valued
ally in the winning of Ruths hand than out of any excessive concern for
Richard himselfhad risen early and hastened to Lupton House in the
hope which he recognized as all but forlorn of yet being able to avert
the disaster he foresaw for Richard

Peering over the orchard wall as he rode by he caught a glimpse
through an opening between the trees of Ruth herself and Diana on the
lawn beyond There was a wicket gate that stood unlatched and availing
himself of this Sir Rowland tethered his horse in the lane and threading
his way briskly through the orchard came suddenly upon the girls
Their laughter reached him as he advanced and told him they could know
nothing yet of Richards danger

On his abrupt and unexpected apparition Diana paled and Ruth flushed
slightly whereupon Sir Rowland might have bethought him had he been
booklearned of the axiom Amour qui rougit fleurette amour qui
plit drame du coeur

He doffed his hat and bowed his fair ringlets tumbling forward till
they hid his face which was exceeding grave

Ruth gave him good morning pleasantly You London folk are earlier
risers than we are led to think she added

Twill be the change of air makes Sir Rowland matutinal said Diana
making a gallant recovery from her agitation

I vow said he that I had grown matutinal earlier had I known what
here awaited me

Awaited you quoth Diana and tossed her head archly disdainful La
Sir Rowland your modesty will be the death of you Archness became
this lady of the sunny hair tiptilted nose and complexion that
outvied the appleblossoms She was shorter by a halfhead than her
darker cousin and made up in sprightliness what she lacked of Ruths
gentle dignity The pair were foils each setting off the graces of the
other

I protest I am foolish answered Blake a shade discomfited But I
want not for excuse I have it in the matter that brings me here
So solemn was his air so sober his voice that both girls felt a
premonition of the untoward message that he bore It was Ruth who asked
him to explain himself

Will you walk ladies said Blake and waved the hand that still held
his hat riverwards adown the sloping lawn They moved away together
Sir Rowland pacing between his love of yesterday and his love of today
pressed with questions from both He shaded his eyes to look at the
river dazzling in the morning sunlight that came over Polden Hill and
standing thus he unburdened himself at last

My news concerns Richard andMr Wilding They looked at him
Miss Westmacotts fine level brows were knit He paused to ask as if
suddenly observing his absence Is Richard not yet risen

Not yet said Ruth and waited for him to proceed

It does credit to his courage that he should sleep late on such a day
said Blake and was pleased with the adroitness wherewith he broke the
news He quarrelled last night with Anthony Wilding

Ruths hand went to her bosom fear stared at Blake from out her eyes
blue as the heavens overhead a grey shade overcast the usual warm
pallor of her face

With Mr Wilding she cried That man And though she said no more
her eyes implored him to go on and tell her what more there might be
He did so and he spared not Wilding The task indeed was one to which
he applied himself with a certain zest whatever might be the outcome
of the affair there was no denying that he was by way of reaping profit
from it by the final overthrow of an acknowledged rival And when he
told her how Richard had flung his wine in Wildings face when Wilding
stood to toast her a faint flush crept to her cheeks

Richard did well said she I am proud of him

The words pleased Sir Rowland vastly but he reckoned without Diana
Miss Hortons mind was illumined by her knowledge of herself In the
light of that she saw precisely what capital this talebearer sought to
make The occasion might not be without its opportunities for her and
to begin with it was no part of her intention that Wilding should be
thus maligned and finally driven from the lists of rivalry with Blake
Upon Wilding indeed and his notorious masterfulness did she found what
hopes she still entertained of winning back Sir Rowland

Surely said she you are a little hard on Mr Wilding You speak as
if he were the first gallant that ever toasted ladys eyes

I am no lady of his Diana Ruth reminded her with a faint show of
heat

Diana shrugged her shoulders You may not love him but you cant
ordain that he shall not love you You are very harsh I think To me it
rather seems that Richard acted like a boor

But mistress cried Sir Rowland half out of countenance and
stifling his vexation in these matters it all depends upon the
manner

Why yes she agreed and whatever Mr Wildings manner if I know
him at all it would be nothing but respectful to the last degree

My own conception of respect said he is not to bandy a ladys name
about a company of revellers

Bethink you though you said just now it all depended on the manner
she rejoined Sir Rowland shrugged and turned half from her to her
listening cousin When all is said poor Diana appearsdespite her
cunningto have been shortsighted Aiming at a defined advantage
in the game she played she either ignored or held too lightly the
concomitant disadvantage of vexing Blake

It were perhaps best to tell us the exact words he used Sir Rowland
she suggested that for ourselves we may judge how far he lacked
respect

What signify the words cried Blake now almost out of temper
I dont recall them It is the air with which he pledged Mistress
Westmacott

Ah yesthe manner quoth Diana irritatingly Well let that be
Richard threw his wine in Mr Wildings face What followed then What
said Mr Wilding

Sir Rowland remembered what Mr Wilding had said and bethought him
that it were impolitic in him to repeat it At the same time not having
looked for this crossquestioning he was all unprepared with any likely
answer He hesitated until Ruth echoed Dianas question

Tell us Sir Rowland she begged him what Mr Wilding said

Being forced to say something and being by nature slowwitted and
sluggish of invention Sir Rowland was compelled to his unspeakable
chagrin to fall back upon the truth

Is not that proof cried Diana in triumph Mr Wilding was reluctant
to quarrel with Richard He was even ready to swallow such an affront
as that thinking it might be offered him under a misconception of his
meaning He plainly professed the respect that filled him for Mistress
Westmacott and yet and yet Sir Rowland you tell us that he lacked
respect

Madam cried Blake turning crimson that matters nothing It was not
the place or time to introduce your cousins name

You think Sir Rowland put in Ruth her air grave judicial almost
that Richard behaved well

As I would like to behave myself as I would have a son of mine behave
on the like occasion Blake protested But we waste words he cried
I did not come to defend Richard nor just to bear you this untoward
news I came to consult with you in the hope that we might find some
way to avert this peril from your brother

What way is possible asked Ruth and sighed I would not I would
not have Richard a coward

Would you prefer him dead asked Blake sadly grave

Sooner than cravenyes Ruth answered him very white

There is no question of that was Blakes rejoinder The question
is that Wilding said last night that he would kill the boy and what
Wilding says he does Out of the affection that I bear Richard is born
my anxiety to save him despite himself It is in this that I come to
seek your aid or offer mine Allied we might accomplish what singly
neither of us could

He had at once the reward of his cunning speech Ruth held out her
hands You are a good friend Sir Rowland she said with a pale
smile and pale too was the smile with which Diana watched them No more
than Ruth did she suspect the sincerity of Blakes protestations

I am proud you should account me that said the baronet taking Ruths
hands and holding them a moment and I would that I could prove myself
your friend in this to some good purpose Believe me if Wilding would
consent that I might take your brothers place I would gladly do so

It was a safe boast knowing as he did that Wilding would consent to
no such thing but it earned him a glance of greater kindliness from
Ruthwho began to think that hitherto perhaps she had done him some
injusticeand a look of greater admiration from Diana who saw in him
her beauideal of the gallant lover

I would not have you endanger yourself so said Ruth

It might said Blake his blue eyes very fierce be no great danger
after all And then dismissing that part of the subject as if like
a brave man the notion of being thought boastful were unpleasant he
passed on to the discussion of ways and means by which the coming duel
might be averted But when they came to grips with facts it seemed that
Sir Rowland had as little idea of what might be done as had the ladies
True he began by making the obvious suggestion that Richard should
tender Wilding a full apology That indeed was the only door of
escape and Blake shrewdly suspected that what the boy had been
unwilling to do last nightpartly through wine and partly through
the fear of looking fearful in the eyes of Lord Gervase Scoresbys
guestshe might be willing enough to do today sober and upon
reflection For the rest Blake was as far from suspecting Mr Wildings
peculiar frame of mind as had Richard been last night This his words
showed

I am satisfied said he that if Richard were to go today to Wilding
and express his regret for a thing done in the heat of wine Wilding
would be forced to accept it as satisfaction and none would think that
it did other than reflect credit upon Richard

Are you very sure of that asked Ruth her tone dubious her glance
hopefully anxious

What else is to be thought

But put in Diana shrewdly it were an admission of Richards that he
had done wrong

No less he agreed and Ruth caught her breath in fresh dismay

And yet you have said that he did as you would have a son of yours do
Diana reminded him

And I maintain it answered Blake his wits worked slowly ever It was
for Ruth to reveal the flaw to him

Do you not understand then she asked him sadly that such an
admission on Richards part would amount to a liea lie uttered to save
himself from an encounter the worst form of lie a lie of cowardice
Surely Sir Rowland your kindly anxiety for his life outruns your
anxiety for his honour

Diana having accomplished her task hung her head in silence
pondering

Sir Rowland was routed utterly He glanced from one to the other of his
companions and grew afraid that hethe town gallantmight come to
look foolish in the eyes of these country ladies He protested again
his love for Richard and increased Ruths terror by his mention of
Wildings swordsmanship but when all was said he saw that he had best
retreat ere he spoiled the good effect which he hoped his solicitude had
created And so he spoke of seeking counsel with Lord Gervase Scoresby
and took his leave promising to return by noon






CHAPTER III DIANA SCHEMES

Notwithstanding the brave face Ruth Westmacott had kept during his
presence when he departed Sir Rowland left behind him a distress
amounting almost to anguish in her mind Yet though she might suffer
there was no weakness in Ruths nature She knew how to endure Diana
bearing Richard not a tenth of the affection his sister consecrated to
him was alarmed for him Besides her own interests urged the averting
of this encounter And so she held in accents almost tearful that
something must be done to save him

This too appeared to be Richards own view when presentlywithin a
few minutes of Blakes departurehe came to join them They watched
his approach in silence and both notedthough with different eyes and
different feelingsthe pallor of his fair face the dark lines under
his colourless eyes His condition was abject and his manners never
of the bestfor there was much of the spoiled child about Richardwere
clearly suffering from it

He stood before his sister and his cousin moving his eyes shiftily from
one to the other rubbing his hands nervously together

Your precious friend Sir Rowland has been here said he and it was
not clear from his manner which of them he addressed Not a doubt but
he will have brought you the news He seemed to sneer

Ruth advanced towards him her face grave her sweet eyes full of
pitying concern She placed a hand upon his sleeve My poor Richard
she began but he shook off her kindly touch laughing angrilya mere
cackle of irritability

Odso he interrupted her It is a thought late for this mock
kindliness

Diana in the background arched her brows then with a shrug turned
aside and seated herself on the stone seat by which they had been
standing Ruth shrank back as if her brother had struck her

Richard she cried and searched his livid face with her eyes
Richard

He read a question in the interjection and he answered it Had you
known any real care any true concern for me you had not given cause
for this affair he chid her peevishly

What are you saying she cried and it occurred to her at last that
Richard was afraid He was a coward She felt as she would faint

I am saying said he hunching his shoulders and shivering as he
spoke yet his glance unable to meet hers that it is your fault that
I am like to get my throat cut before sunset

My fault she murmured The slope of lawn seemed to wave and swim
about her My fault

The fault of your wanton ways he accused her harshly You have so
played fast and loose with this fellow Wilding that he makes free of
your name in my very presence and puts upon me the need to get myself
killed by him to save the family honour

He would have said more in this strain but something in her glance gave
him pause There fell a silence From the distance came the melodious
pealing of church bells High overhead a lark was pouring out its song
in the lane at the orchard end rang the beat of trotting hoofs It
was Diana who spoke presently Just indignation stirred her and when
stirred she knew no pity set no limits to her speech

I think indeed said she her voice crisp and merciless that the
family honour will best be saved if Mr Wilding kills you It is in
danger while you live You are a coward Richard

Diana he thunderedhe could be mighty brave with womenwhilst Ruth
clutched her arm to restrain her

But she continued undeterred You are a cowarda pitiful coward she
told him Consult your mirror It will tell you what a palsied thing
you are That you should dare so speak to Ruth

Dont Ruth begged her turning

Aye growled Richard she had best be silent

Diana rose to battle her cheeks crimson It asks a braver man than
you to compel my obedience she told him La she fumed Ill swear
that had Mr Wilding overheard what you have said to your sister you
would have little to fear from his sword A cane would be the weapon
hed use on you

Richards pale eyes flamed malevolently a violent rage possessed him
and flooded out his fear for nothing can so goad a man as an offensive
truth Ruth approached him again again she took him by the arm seeking
to soothe his overtroubled spirit but again he shook her off And then
to save the situation came a servant from the house So lost in anger
was all Richards sense of decency that the mere supervention of the
man would not have been enough to have silenced him could he have found
adequate words in which to answer Mistress Horton But even as he racked
his mind the footmans voice broke the silence and the words the
fellow uttered did what his presence alone might not have sufficed to
do

Mr Vallancey is asking for you sir he announced

Richard started Vallancey He had come at last and his coming was
connected with the impending duel The thought was paralyzing to young
Westmacott The flush of anger faded from his face its leaden hue
returned and he shivered as with cold At last he mastered himself
sufficiently to ask

Where is he Jasper

In the library sir replied the servant Shall I bring him hither

Yesno he answered I will come to him He turned his back upon
the ladies paused a moment still irresolute Then as by an effort
he followed the servant across the lawn and vanished through the ivied
porch

As he went Diana flew to her cousin Her shallow nature was touched with
transient pity My poor Ruth she murmured soothingly and set her
arm about the others waist There was a gleam of tears in the eyes Ruth
turned upon her Together they came to the granite seat and sank to it
side by side fronting the placid river There Ruth her elbows on her
knees cradled her chin in her hands and with a sigh of misery stared
straight before her

It was untrue she said at last What Richard said of me was untrue

Why yes Diana snapped contemptuous The only truth is that Richard
is afraid

Ruth shivered Ah no she pleadedshe knew how true was the
impeachment Dont say it Diana

It matters little that I say it snorted Diana impatiently It is a
truth proclaimed by the first glance at him

He is in poor health perhaps said Ruth seeking miserably to excuse
him

Aye said Diana Hes suffering from an aguethe result of a lack
of courage That he should so have spoken to you Give me patience
Heaven

Ruth crimsoned again at the memory of his words a wave of indignation
swept through her gentle soul but was gone at once leaving an
ineffable sadness in its room What was to be done She turned to Diana
for counsel But Diana was still whipping up her scorn

If he goes out to meet Mr Wilding hell shame himself and every man
and woman that bears the name of Westmacott said she and struck a new
fear with that into the heart of Ruth

He must not go she answered passionately He must not meet him

Diana flashed her a sidelong glance And if he doesnt will things be
mended she inquired Will it save his honour to have Mr Wilding come
and cane him

Hed not do that said Ruth

Not if you asked himno was Dianas sharp retort and she caught her
breath on the last word of it for just then the Devil dropped the seed
of a suggestion into the fertile soil of her lovesick soul

Diana Ruth exclaimed in reproof turning to confront her cousin But
Dianas mind started upon its scheming journey was now travelling fast
Out of that devils seed there sprang with amazing rapidity a treelike
growth throwing out branches putting forth leaves bearing alreadyin
her fancybloom and fruit

Why not quoth she after a breathing space and her voice was gentle
her tone innocent beyond compare Why should you not ask him Ruth
frowned perplexed and thoughtful and now Diana turned to her with
the lively eye of one into whose mind has leapt a sudden inspiration
Ruth she exclaimed Why indeed should you not ask him to forgo
this duel

How how could I faltered Ruth

Hed not deny you you know hed not

I do not know it answered Ruth But if I did how could I ask it

Were I Richards sister and had I his life and honour at heart as you
have Id not ask how If Richard goes to that encounter he loses both
rememberunless between this and then he undergoes some change Were I
in your place Id straight to Wilding

To him mused Ruth sitting up How could I go to him

Go to him yes Diana insisted Go to him at oncewhile there is yet
time

Ruth rose and moved away a step or two towards the water deep in
thought Diana watched her furtively and slyly the rapid rise and fall
of her maiden breast betraying the agitation that filled her as she
waitedlike a gamesterfor the turn of the card that would show her
whether she had won or lost For she saw clearly how Ruth might be so
compromised that there was something more than a chance that Diana would
no longer have cause to account her cousin a barrier between herself and
Blake

I could not go alone said Ruth and her tone was that of one still
battling with a notion that is repugnant

Why if that is all said Diana then Ill go with you

I cant I cant Consider the humiliation

Consider Richard rather the fair temptress made answer eagerly Be
sure that Mr Wilding will save you all humiliation Hell not deny you
At a word from you I know what answer he will make He will refuse to
push the matter forwardacknowledge himself in the wrong do whatever
you may ask him He can do it None will question his courage It has
been proved too often She rose and came to Ruth She set her arm
about her waist again and poured shrewd persuasion over her cousins
indecision Tonight youll thank me for this thought she assured
her Why do you pause Are you so selfish as to think more of the
little humiliation that may await you than of Richards life and
honour

No no Ruth protested feebly

What then Is Richard to go out and slay his honour by a show of fear
before he is slain himself by the man he has insulted

Ill go said Ruth Now that the resolve was taken she was brisk
impatient Come Diana Let Jerry saddle for us Well ride to Zoyland
Chase at once

They went without a word to Richard who was still closeted with
Vallancey and riding forth they crossed the river and took the road
that skirting Sedgemoor runs south to Weston Zoyland They rode with
little said until they came to the point where the road branches on the
left throwing out an arm across the moor towards Chedzoy a mile or so
short of Zoyland Chase Here Diana reined in with a sharp gasp of pain
Ruth checked and cried to know what ailed her

It is the sun I think muttered Diana her hand to her brow I am
sick and giddy And she slipped a thought heavily to the ground In an
instant Ruth had dismounted and was beside her Diana was pale which
lent colour to her complaint for Ruth was not to know that the pallor
sprang from her agitation in wondering whether the ruse she attempted
would succeed or not

A short stonesthrow from where they had halted stood a cottage back
from the road in a little plot of ground the property of a kindly old
woman known to both There Diana expressed the wish to rest awhile and
thither they took their way Ruth leading both horses and supporting her
faltering cousin The dame was all solicitude Diana was led into her
parlour and what could be done was done Her corsage was loosened
water drawn from the well and brought her to drink and bathe her brow

She sat back languidly her head lolling sideways against one of the
wings of the great chair and languidly assured them she would be better
soon if she were but allowed to rest awhile Ruth drew up a stool to
sit beside her for all that her soul fretted at this delay What if in
consequence she should reach Zoyland Chase too lateto find that Mr
Wilding had gone forth already But even as she was about to sit it
seemed that the same thought had of a sudden come to Diana The girl
leaned forward thrustingas if by an effortsome of her faintness
from her

Do not wait for me Ruth she begged

I must child

You must not the other insisted Think what it may meanRichards
life perhaps No no Ruth dear Go on go on to Zoyland Ill follow
you in a few minutes

Ill wait for you said Ruth with firmness

At that Diana rose and in rising staggered Then well push on at
once she gasped as if speech itself were an excruciating effort

But you are in no case to stand said Ruth Sit Diana sit

Either you go on alone or I go with you but go at once you must At
any moment Mr Wilding may go forth and your chance is lost Ill not
have Richards blood upon my head

Ruth wrung her hands in her dismay confronted by a parlous choice
Consent to Dianas accompanying her in this condition she could not
ride on alone to Mr Wildings house was hardly to be thought of and
yet if she delayed she was endangering Richards life By the very
strength of her nature she was caught in the mesh of Dianas scheme
She saw that her hesitation was unworthy This was no ordinary cause no
ordinary occasion It was a time for heroic measures She must ride on
nor could she consent to take Diana

And so in the end she went having seen her cousin settled again in the
high chair and took with her Dianas feeble assurances that she would
follow her in a few moments as soon as her faintness passed






CHAPTER IV TERMS OF SURRENDER

MR WILDING rode at dawn with Mr Trenchard madam announced old
Walters the butler at Zoyland Chase Old and familiar servant though he
was he kept from his countenance all manifestation of the deep surprise
occasioned him by the advent of Mistress Westmacott unescorted

He rode at dawn faltered Ruth and for a moment she stood
irresolute afraid and pondering in the shade of the great pillared
porch Then she took heart again If he rode at dawn it was not in
quest of Richard that he went since it had been near eleven oclock
when she had left Bridgwater He must have gone on other business first
and doubtless before he went to the encounter he would be returning
home Said he at what hour he would return she asked

He bade us expect him by noon madam

This gave confirmation to her thoughts It wanted more than half an hour
to noon already Then he may return at any moment said she

At any moment madam was the grave reply

She took her resolve I will wait she announced to the mans
increasing if undisplayed astonishment Let my horse be seen to

He bowed his obedience and she followed hima slender graceful
figure in her dovecoloured ridinghabit laced with silveracross the
stoneflagged vestibule through the cool gloom of the great hall into
the spacious library of which he held the door

Mistress Horton is following me she informed the butler Will you
bring her to me when she comes

Bowing again in silent acquiescence the whitehaired servant closed the
door and left her She stood in the centre of the great room drawing
off her ridinggloves perturbed and frightened beyond all reason at
finding herself for the first time under Mr Wildings roof He was
most handsomely housed His grandfather who had travelled in Italy
had built the Chase upon the severe and noble lines which there he had
learnt to admire and he had embellished its interior too with many
treasures of art which with that intent he had there collected

She dropped her whip and gloves on to a table and sank into a chair
to wait her heart fluttering in her throat Time passed and in the
silence of the great house her anxiety was gradually quieted until at
last through the long window that stood open came faintly wafted to her
on the soft breeze of that June morning the sound of a church clock at
Weston Zoyland chiming twelve She rose with a start bethinking her
suddenly of Diana and wondering why she had not yet arrived Was the
childs indisposition graver than she had led Ruth to suppose She
crossed to the windows and stood there drumming impatiently upon the
pane her eyes straying idly over the sweep of elmfringed lawns towards
the river gleaming silvery here and there between the trees in the
distance

Suddenly she caught a sound of hoofs Was this Diana She sped to the
other window the one that stood open and now she heard the crunch of
gravel and the champ of bits and the sound of more than two pairs of
hoofs She caught a glimpse of Mr Wilding and Mr Trenchard

She felt the colour flying from her cheeks again her heart fluttered in
her throat and it was in vain that with her hand she sought to repress
the heaving of her breast She was afraid her every instinct bade her
slip through the window at which she stood and run from Zoyland Chase
And then she thought of Richard and his danger and she seemed to gather
courage from the reflection of her purpose in this house

Mens voices reached hera laugh the harsh cawing of Nick Trenchard

A lady she heard him cry Ods heart Tony Is this a time for
trafficking with doxies She crimsoned an instant at the coarse word
and set her teeth only to pale again the next The voices were
lowered so that she heard not what was said one sharp exclamation she
recognized to be in Wildings voice but caught not the word he uttered
There followed a pause and she stirred uneasily waiting Then
came swift steps and jangling spurs across the hall the door opened
suddenly and Mr Wilding in a scarlet ridingcoat his boots white
with dust stood bowing to her from the threshold

Your servant Mistress Westmacott she heard him murmur My house is
deeply honoured

She dropped him a halfcurtsy pale and tonguetied He turned to
deliver hat and whip and gloves to Walters who had followed him then
closed the door and came forward into the room

You will forgive that I present myself thus before you he said
in apology for his dusty raiment But I bethought me you might be in
haste and Walters tells me that already have you waited nigh upon an
hour Will you not sit madam And he advanced a chair His long white
face was set like a mask but his dark slanting eyes devoured her He
guessed the reason of her visit She who had humbled him who had driven
him to the very borders of despair was now to be humbled and to despair
before him Under the impassive face his soul exulted fiercely

She disregarded the chair he proffered My visit has no doubt
surprised you she began tremulous and hesitating

I faith no he answered quietly The cause after all is not very
far to seek You are come on Richards behalf

Not on Richards she answered On my own And now that the ice was
broken the suspense of waiting over she found the tide of her courage
flowing fast This encounter must not take place Mr Wilding she
informed him

He raised his eyebrowsfine and level as her ownhis thin lips smiled
never so faintly It is I think said he for Richard to prevent it
The chance was his last night It shall be his again when we meet If he
will express regret He left his sentence there In truth he mocked
her though she guessed it not

You mean said she that if he makes apology

What else What other way remains

She shook her head and if pale her face was resolute her glance
steady

That is impossible she told him Last nightas I have the storyhe
might have done it without shame Today it is too late To tender his
apology on the ground would be to proclaim himself a coward

Mr Wilding pursed his lips and shifted his position It is difficult
perhaps said he but not impossible

It is impossible she insisted firmly

Ill not quarrel with you for a word he answered mighty agreeable
Call it impossible if you will Admit however that it is all I
can suggest You will do me the justice I am sure to see that in
expressing my willingness to accept your brothers expressions of regret
I am proving myself once more your very obedient servant But that it is
you who ask itand whose desires are my commandsI should let no man
go unpunished for an insult such as your brother put upon me

She winced at his words at the bow with which he had professed himself
once more her servant

It is no clemency that you offer him she said You leave him a
choice between death and dishonour

He has Wilding reminded her the chance of combat

She flung back her head impatiently I think you mock me said she

He looked at her keenly Will you tell me plainly madam he begged
what you would have me do

She flushed under his gaze and the flush told him what he sought to
learn There was of course another way and she had thought of it
but she lackedas well she might all things consideredthe courage
to propose it She had come to Mr Wilding in the vague hope that he
himself would choose the heroic part And he to punish for her scorn
of him this woman whom he loved to hatingpoint was resolved that she
herself must beg it of him Whether having so far compelled her he
would grant her prayer or not was something he could not just then
himself have told you She bowed her head in silence and Wilding that
faint smile half friendliness half mockery hovering ever on his
lips turned aside and moved softly towards the window Her eyes veiled
behind the long lashes of their drooping lids followed him furtively
She felt that she hated him in very truth She marked the upright
elegance of his figure the easy grace of his movements the fine
aristocratic mould of the aquiline face which she beheld in profile
and she hated him the more for these outward favours that must commend
him to no lack of women He was too masterful He made her realize too
keenly her own weakness and that of Richard She felt that just now he
controlled the vice that held her fasther affection for her brother
And because of that she hated him the more You see Mistress
Westmacott said he his shoulder to her his tone sweet to the point
of sadness that there is nothing else She stood her eyes following
the pattern of the parquetry her foot unconsciously tracing it her
courage ebbed and she had no answer for him After a pause he spoke
again still without turning If that was not enough to suit your
endsand though he spoke in a tone of everincreasing sadness there
glinted through it the faintest ray of mockeryI marvel you should
have come to Zoylandto compromise yourself to so little purpose

She raised a startled face Com compromise myself she echoed
Oh It was a cry of indignation

What else quoth he and turned abruptly to confront her

Mistress Horton was was with me she panted her voice quivering as
on the brink of tears

Tis unfortunate you should have separated he condoled

But but Mr Wilding I I trusted to your honour I accounted you
a gentleman Surely surely sir you will not let it be known that
I came to you You will keep my secret

Secret said he his eyebrows raised Tis already the talk of the
servants hall By tomorrow twill be the gossip of Bridgwater

Air failed her Her blue eyes fixed him in horror out of her stricken
face Not a word had she wherewith to answer him

The sight of her thus affected him oddly His passion for her surged
up aroused by pity for her plight and awakened in him a sense of his
brutality A faint flush stirred in his cheeks He stepped quickly to
her and caught her hand She let it lie cold and inert within his
nervous grasp

Ruth Ruth he cried and his voice was for once unsteady Give it no
thought I love you Ruth If youll but heed that no breath of scandal
can hurt you

She swallowed hard As how she asked mechanically

He bowed low over her handso low that his face was hidden from her

If you will do me the honour to become my wife he began but got no
further for she snatched away her hand her cheeks crimsoning her eyes
aflame with indignation He stepped back crimsoning too She had dashed
the gentleness from his mood He was angered now and tigerish

Oh she panted It is to affront me Is this the time or place

He cropped her flow of indignant speech ere it was well begun He caught
her in his arms and held her tight and so sudden was the act so firm
his grip that she had not the thought or force to struggle

All time is loves time all places are loves place he told her
his face close to her own And of all time and places the present ever
preferable to the wisefor life is uncertain and short at best I bring
you worship and you answer me with scorn But I shall prevail and you
shall come to love me in very spite of your own self

She threw back her head away from his as far as the bonds he had cast
about her would allow Air Air she panted feebly

Oh you shall have air enough anon he answered with a halfstrangled
laugh his passion mounting ever Hark you nowhark you for
Richards sake since youll not listen for my own nor yours There is
another course by which I can save both Richards life and honour
You know it and you counted upon my generosity to suggest it But you
overlooked the thing on which you should have counted You overlooked my
love Count upon that my Ruth and Richard shall have naught to fear
Count upon that and when we meet this evening Richard and I it is
I who will tender the apology I who will admit that I was wrong to
introduce your name into that company last night and that what Richard
did was a just and welldeserved punishment upon me This will I do if
youll but count upon my love

She looked up at him fearfully yet with flutterings of hope What ist
you mean she asked him faintly

That if youll promise to be my wife

Your wife she interrupted him She struggled to free herself
released one arm and struck him in the face Let me go you coward

He was answered His arms melted from her He fell back a pace very
white and even trembling the fire all gone from his eye which was now
turned dull and deadly

So be it he said and strode to the bellrope Ill not offend
again I had not offended nowhe continued in the voice of one
offering an explanation cold and formalbut that when first I came
into your life you seemed to bid me welcome His fingers closed upon
the crimson bellcord She guessed his purpose

Wait she gasped and put forth her hand He paused the rope in his
his eye kindling anew You you mean to kill Richard now she asked
him

A swift lifting of his brows was his only answer He tugged the cord
From the distance the peal of the bell reached them faintly

Oh wait wait she begged her hands pressed against her cheeks He
stood impassiblehatefully impassible  if I were to consent
to this how how soon He understood the unfinished
question Interest warmed his face again He took a step towards her
but by a gesture she seemed to beg him come no nearer

If you will promise to marry me within the week Richard shall have no
cause to fear either for his life or his honour at my hands

She seemed now to be recovering her calm Very well she said her
voice singularly steady Let that be a bargain between us Spare
Richards life and honourboth rememberand on Sunday next For
all her courage her voice quavered and faltered She dared add no more
lest it should break altogether

Mr Wilding drew a deep breath Again he would have advanced Ruth
he cried and some repentance smote him some shame shook him in
his purpose At that moment it was in his mind to capitulate
unconditionally to tell her that Richard should have naught to fear
from him and yet that she should go free as the winds Her gesture
checked him It was so eloquent of aversion He paused in his advance
stifled his better feelings and turned once more relentless The door
opened and old Walters stood awaiting his commands

Mistress Westmacott is leaving he informed his servant and bowed
low and formally in farewell before her She passed out without another
word the old butler following and presently through the door that
remained open came Trenchard in quest of Mr Wilding who stood bemused

Nick sauntered in his left eye almost hidden by the rakish cock of his
hat one hand tucked away under the skirts of his plumcoloured coat
the other supporting the stem of a long clay pipe at which he was
pulling thoughtfully The pipe and he were all but inseparable indeed
the year before in London he had given appalling scandal by appearing
with it in the Mall and had there remained him any character to lose
he must assuredly have lost it then

He observed his friend through narrowing eyeshe had small eyes very
blue and very bright in which there usually abode a roguish gleam

My sight Anthony said he reminds me that I am growing old I
wonder did it mislead me on the score of your visitor

The lady who left said Wilding with a touch of severity will be
Mistress Wilding by this day senight

Trenchard took the pipe from his lips audibly blew out a cloud of smoke
and stared at his friend Body o me quoth he Is this a time for
marryingwith these rumours of Monmouths coming over

Wilding made an impatient gesture I thought to have convinced you they
are idle said he and flung himself into a chair at his writingtable

Nick came over and perched himself upon the tables edge one leg
swinging in the air And what of this matter of the intercepted letter
from London to our Taunton friends

I cant tell you But of this I am sure His Grace is incapable of
anything so rash Certain is it that hell not stir until Battiscomb
returns to Holland and Battiscomb is still in Cheshire sounding the
Dukes friends

Yet were I you I should not marry just at present

Wilding smiled If you were me youd never marry at all

Faith no said Trenchard Id as soon play at hotcockles or
Parsonhaslosthiscloak Tis a mort more amusing and the sooner
done with






CHAPTER V THE ENCOUNTER

Ruth Wesmacott rode back like one in a dream with vague and hazy
notions of what she saw or did So overwrought was she by the interview
from which she came her mind so obsessed by it that never a thought
had she for Diana and her indisposition until she arrived home to
find her cousin there before her Diana was in tears called up by the
reproaches of her mother Lady Hortonthe relict of that fine soldier
Sir Cholmondeley Horton of Taunton

The girl had arrived at Lupton House a halfhour ahead of Miss
Westmacott and upon her arrival she had expressed surprise either
feigned or real at finding Ruth still absent Detecting the alarm
that Diana was careful to throw into her voice and manner her mother
questioned her and elicited the story of her faintness and of Ruths
having ridden on alone to Mr Wildings So outraged was Lady Horton
that for once in a way this woman usually so meek and easeloving
was roused to an energy and anger with her daughter and her niece that
threatened to remove Diana at once from the pernicious atmosphere of
Lupton House and carry her home to Taunton Ruth found her still at her
remonstrances arrived indeed in time for her share of them

I have been sore mistaken in you Ruth the dame reproached her I
can scarce believe it of you I have held you up as an example to Diana
for the discretion and wisdom of your conduct and you do this You go
alone to Mr Wildings houseto Mr Wildings of all men

It was no time for ordinary measures said Ruth but she spoke without
any of the heat of one who defends her conduct She was the slyly
watchful Diana observed very white and tired It was no time to think
of nice conduct There was Richard to be saved

And was it worth ruining yourself to do that quoth Lady Horton her
colour high

Ruining myself echoed Ruth and she smiled never so weary a smile I
have indeed done that though not in the way you mean

Mother and daughter eyed her mystified Your good name is blasted
said her aunt unless so be that Mr Wilding is proposing to make you
his wife It was a sneer the good woman could not in her indignation
repress

That is what Mr Wilding has done me the honour to propose Ruth
answered bitterly and left them gaping We are to be married this day
senight

A dead silence followed the calm announcement Then Diana rose At the
misery the anguish that could impress so strange and white a look
on Ruths winsome face she was smitten with remorse her incipient
satisfaction dashed This was her work the fruit of her scheming But
it had gone further than she had foreseen and for all that no result
could better harmonize with her own ambitions and desires for the
momentunder the first shock of that announcementshe felt guilty and
grew afraid

Ruth she cried her voice a whisper of stupefaction Oh I wish I
had come with you

But you couldnt you were faint And thenrecalling what had
passedher mind was filled with sudden concern for Diana even amid her
own sore troubles Are you quite yourself again Diana she inquired

Diana answered almost fiercely I am quite well And then with a
change to wistfulness she added Oh I would I had come with you

Matters had been no different Ruth assured her It was a bargain
Mr Wilding drove It was the price I had to pay for Richards life and
honour She swallowed hard and let her hands fall limply to her sides
Where is Richard she inquired

It was her aunt who answered her He went forth half an hour agone with
Mr Vallancey and Sir Rowland

Sir Rowland had returned then She looked up quickly

Yes answered Diana But he had achieved nothing by his visit to Lord
Gervase His lordship would not intervene he swore he hoped the cub
would be flayed alive by Wilding Those were his lordships words as
Sir Rowland repeated them Sir Rowland is in sore distress for Richard
He has gone with them to the meeting

At least he has no longer cause for his distress said Miss
Westmacott with her bitter smile and sank as one exhausted to a chair
Lady Horton moved to comfort her her motherliness all aroused for this
motherless girl usually so wise and strong and seemingly wiser and
stronger than ever in this thing that Lady Horton had deemed a weakness
and a folly

Meanwhile Richard and his two friends were on their way to the moors
across the river to the encounter with Mr Wilding But before they
had got him to ride forth Vallancey had had occasion to regret that he
stood committed to a share in this quarrel for he came to know Richard
as he really was He had found him in an abject state white and
trembling his cowards fancy anticipating a hundred times a minute the
death he was anon to die

Vallancey had hailed him cheerily

The day is yours Dick he had cried when Richard entered the library
where he awaited him Wild Wilding has ridden to Taunton this morning
and is to be back by noon Odsbud Dicktwenty miles and more in the
saddle before coming on the ground Heard you ever of the like madness
Hell be stiff as a broomhandlean easy victim

Richard listened stared and finding Vallanceys eyes fixed steadily
upon him attempted a smile and achieved a horrible grimace

What ails you man cried his second and caught him by the wrist He
felt the quiver of the others limb Stab me quoth he you are in no
case to fight What the plague ails you

I am none so well this morning answered Richard feebly Lord
Gervases claret he added passing a hand across his brow

Lord Gervases claret echoed Vallancey in horror as at some
outrageous blasphemy Frontignac at ten shillings the bottle he
exclaimed

Still claret never does lie easy on my stomach Richard explained
intent upon blaming Lord Gervase s winesince he could think of nothing
elsefor his condition

Vallancey looked at him shrewdly My cock said he if youre to
fight well have to mend your temper He took it upon himself to ring
the bell and to order up two bottles of Canary and one of brandy If he
was to get his man to the ground at alland young Vallancey had a due
sense of his responsibilities in that connectionit would be well to
supply Richard with something to replace the courage that had oozed
out overnight Young Richard never loath to fortify himself proved
amenable enough to the stiffly laced Canary that his friend set before
him Then to divert his mind Vallancey with that rash freedom that
had made the whole of Somerset know him for a rebel set himself to talk
of the Protestant Duke and his right to the crown of England

He was still at his talk Richard listening moodily what time he was
slowly but surely befuddling himself when Sir Rowlandreturning from
Scoresby Hallcame to bring the news of his lack of success Richard
hailed him noisily and bade him ring for another glass adding with
a burst of oaths some appalling threats of how anon he should serve
Anthony Wilding His wits drowned in the stiff liquor Vallancey had
pressed upon him he seemed of a sudden to have grown as fierce and
bloodthirsty as any scourer that ever terrorized the watch

Blake listened to him and grunted Body o me swore the town gallant
If thats the humour youre going out to fight in Ill trouble you for
the eight guineas I won from you at Primero yesterday before you start

Richard reared himself by the help of the table and stood a thought
unsteadily his glance laboriously striving to engage Blakes

Damn me quoth he Your want of faith dishgraces meand t shgraces
you Shalt ha the guineas when were backand not before

Hum quoth Blake to whom eight guineas were a consideration in these
bankrupt days And if you dont come back at all upon whom am I to
draw

The suggestion sank through Dicks halffuddled senses and the scare it
gave him was reflected on his face

Damn you Blake swore Vallancey between his teeth Is that a decent
way to talk to a man who is going out Never heed him Dick Let him
wait for his dirty guineas till we return

Thirty guineas hiccoughed Richard It was only eight
Anyhowwaitll Ive sli the gullet ofs Mr Wilding He checked on
a thought that suddenly occurred to him He turned to Vallancey with a
ludicrous solemnity Sbud he swore S a scurvy trick Im playing
the Duke S treason to himtreason no less And he smote the table
with his open hand

Whats that quoth Blake so sharply his eyes so suddenly alert that
Vallancey made haste to cover up his fellow rebels indiscretion

Its the brandyandCanary makes him dream said he with a laugh and
rising as he spoke he announced that it was high time they should set
out Thus he brought about a bustle that drove the Dukes business from
Richards mind and left Blake without a pretext to pursue his quest
for information But the mischief was done and Blakes suspicions were
awake He bethought him now of dark hints that Richard had let fall
to Vallancey in the past few days and of hints less dark with which
Vallanceywho was a careless fellow at ordinary timeshad answered
And now this mention of the Duke and of treason to himto what Duke
could it refer but Monmouth

Blake was well aware of the wild tales that were going round and he
began to wonder now was aught really afoot and was his good friend
Westmacott in it

If there was he bethought him that the knowledge might be of value
and it might help to float once more his shipwrecked fortunes The haste
with which Vallancey had proffered a frivolous explanation of Richards
words the bustle with which upon the instant he swept Richard and Sir
Rowland from the house to get to horse and ride out to Bridgwater were
in themselves circumstances that went to heighten those suspicions of
Sir Rowlands But lacking all opportunity for investigation at the
moment he deemed it wisest to say no more just then lest he should
betray his watchfulness

They were the first to arrive upon the groundan open space on the
borders of Sedgemoor in the shelter of Polden Hill But they had not
long to wait before Wilding and Trenchard rode up attended by a groom
Their arrival had an oddly sobering effect upon young Westmacott for
which Mr Vallancey was thankful For during their ride he had begun to
fear that he had carried too far the business of equipping his principal
with artificial valour

Trenchard came forward to offer Vallancey the courteous suggestion that
Mr Wildings servant should charge himself with the care of the horses
of Mr Westmacotts party if this would be a convenience to
them Vallancey thanked him and accepted the offer and thus the
groominstructed by Trenchardled the five horses some distance from
the spot

It now became a matter of making preparation and leaving Richard to
divest himself of such garments as he might deem cumbrous Vallancey
went forward to consult with Trenchard upon the choice of ground At
that same moment Mr Wilding lounged forward flicking the grass with
his whip in an absent manner

Mr Vallancey he began when Trenchard turned to interrupt him

You can leave it safely to me Tony he growled But there is
something I wish to say Nick answered Mr Wilding his manner mild
By your leave then And he turned again to Valiancey Will you be so
good as to call Mr Westmacott hither

Vallancey stared For what purpose sir he asked

For my purpose answered Mr Wilding sweetly It is no longer my wish
to engage with Mr Westmacott

Anthony cried Trenchard and in his amazement forgot to swear

I propose added Mr Wilding to relieve Mr Westmacott of the
necessity of fighting

Vallancey in his heart thought this might be pleasant news for his
principal Still he did not quite see how the end was to be attained
and said so

You shall be enlightened if you will do as I request Wilding
insisted and Vallancey with a lift of the brows a snort and a shrug
turned away to comply

Do you mean quoth Trenchard bursting with indignation that you
will let live a man who has struck you

Wilding took his friend affectionately by the arm It is a whim of
mine said he Do you think Nick that it is more than I can afford
to indulge

I say not so was the ready answer but

I thought youd not said Mr Wilding interrupting And if any
doeswhy I shall be glad to prove it upon him that he lies He
laughed and Trenchard vexed though he was was forced to laugh with
him Then Nick set himself to urge the thing that last night had plagued
his mind that this Richard might prove a danger to the Cause that
in the Dukes interest if not to safeguard his own person from some
vindictive betrayal Wilding would be better advised in imposing a
reliable silence upon him

But why vindictive Mr Wilding remonstrated Rather must he have
cause for gratitude

Mr Trenchard laughed short and contemptuously There is said he no
rancour more bitter than that of the mean man who has offended you and
whom you have spared I beg youll ponder it He lowered his voice as
he ended his admonition for Vallancey and Westmacott were coming up
followed by Sir Rowland Blake

Richard although his courage had been sinking lower and lower in a
measure as he had grown more and more sober with the approach of the
moment for engaging came forward now with a firm step and an arrogant
mien for Vallancey had given him more than a hint of what was toward
His heart had leapt not only at the deliverance that was promised him
but out of satisfaction at the reflection of how accurately last night
he had gauged what Mr Wilding would endure It had dismayed him then
as we have seen that this man who he thought must stomach any affront
from him out of consideration for his sister should have ended by
calling him to account He concluded now that upon reflection Wilding
had seen his error and was prepared to make amends that he might
extricate himself from an impossible situation and Richard blamed
himself for having overlooked this inevitable solution and given way to
idle panic

Vallancey and Blake watching him and the sudden metamorphosis that was
wrought in him despised him heartily and yet were gladfor the sake
of their association with himthat things were as they were

Mr Westmacott said Wilding quietly his eyes steadily set upon
Richards own arrogant gaze his lips smiling a little I am here not
to fight but to apologize

Richards sneer was audible to all Oh he was gathering courage fast
now that there no longer was the need for it It urged him to lengths of
daring possible only to a fool

If you can take a blow Mr Wilding said he offensively that is
your own affair

And his friends gasped at his temerity and trembled for him not knowing
what grounds he had for counting himself unassailable

Just so said Mr Wilding as meek and humble as a nun and Trenchard
who had expected something very different from him swore aloud and with
some circumstance of oaths The fact is continued Mr Wilding that
what I did last night I did in the heat of wine and I am sorry for
it I recognize that this quarrel is of my provoking that it was
unwarrantable in me to introduce the name of Mistress Westmacott no
matter how respectfully and that in doing so I gave Mr Westmacott
ample grounds for offence For that I beg his pardon and I venture to
hope that this matter need go no further

Vallancey and Blake were speechless in astonishment Trenchard
livid with fury Westmacott moved a step or two forward a swagger
unmistakable in his gait his netherlip thrust out in a sneer

Why said he his voice mighty disdainful if Mr Wilding apologizes
the matter hardly can go further He conveyed such a suggestion of
regret at this that Trenchard bounded forward stung to speech

But if Mr Westmacotts disappointment threatens to overwhelm him he
snapped very tartly I am his humble servant and he may call upon me
to see that hes not robbed of the exercise he came to take

Mr Wilding set a restraining hand upon Trenchards arm

Westmacott turned to him the sneer however gone from his face

I have no quarrel with you sir said he with an uneasy assumption of
dignity

Its a want that may be soon supplied answered Trenchard briskly
and as he afterwards confessed had not Wilding checked him at that
moment he had thrown his hat in Richards face

It was Vallancey who saved the situation cursing in his heart the
bearing of his principal

Mr Wilding said he this is very handsome in you You are of the
happy few who may tender such an apology without reflection upon your
courage

Mr Wilding made him a leg very elegantly You are vastly kind sir
said he

You have given Mr Westmacott the fullest satisfaction and it is with
an increased respect for youif that were possiblethat I acknowledge
it on my friends behalf

You are sir a very mirror of the elegancies said Mr Wilding and
Vallancey wondered was he being laughed at Whether he was or not he
conceived that he had done the only seemly thing He had made handsome
acknowledgment of a handsome apology stung to it by the currishness of
Richard

And there the matter ended despite Trenchards burning eagerness to
carry it himself to a different consummation Wilding prevailed upon
him and withdrew him from the field But as they rode back to Zoyland
Chase the old rake was bitter in his inveighings against Wildings folly
and weakness

I pray Heaven he kept repeating that it may not come to cost you
dear

Have done said Mr Wilding a trifle out of patience Could I wed
the sister having slain the brother

And Trenchard understanding at last accounted himself a numskull that
he had not understood before But he none the less deemed it a pity
Richard had been spared






CHAPTER VI THE CHAMPION

As vainglorious was Richard Westmacotts retreat from the field of
unstricken battle as his advance upon it had been inglorious He spoke
with confidence now of the narrow escape that Wilding had had at
his hands of the things he would have done to Wilding had not that
gentleman grown wise in time Sir Rowland who had seen little of
Richards earlier stricken condition was in a measure imposed upon by
his blustering tone and manner not so Vallancey who remembered the
steps he had been forced to take to bolster up the young mans courage
sufficiently to admit of his being brought to the encounter Richard so
disgusted him that he felt if he did not quit his company soon he would
be quarrelling with him himself So congratulating him in a caustic
manner that Richard did not relish upon the happy termination of the
affair Vallancey took his leave of him and Blake at the crossroads
pleading business with Lord Gervase and left them to proceed without
him to Bridgwater

Blake whose suspicions of some secret matter to which Vallancey
and Richard were wedded had been earlier excited by Westmacotts
indiscretions was full of sly questions now touching the business which
might be taking Vallancey to Scoresby But Richard was too full of
the subject of the fear he had instilled into Wilding to afford his
companion much satisfaction on any other score Thus they came to Lupton
House and as Richard swaggered down the lawn into the presence of the
ladiesRuth and her aunt were occupying the stone bench Diana the
circular seat about the great oak in the centre of the lawnhe was a
very different person from the pale limp creature they had beheld there
some few hours earlier Loud and offensive was he now in selflaudation
and so indifferent to all else that he left unobserved the little smile
half wistful half scornful that visited his sisters lips when he
sneeringly told how Mr Wilding had chosen that better part of valour
which discretion is alleged to be

It needed Diana who blinded by no sisterly affection saw him exactly
as he was and despised him accordingly to enlighten him It may also
be that in doing so at once she had ends of her own to serve for Sir
Rowland was still of the company

Mr Wilding afraid she cried her voice so charged with derision that
it inclined to shrillness La Richard Mr Wilding was never afraid of
any man

Faith said Rowland although his acquaintance with Mr Wilding was
slight and recent It is what I should think He does not look like a
man familiar with fear

Richard struck something of an attitude his fair face flushed his pale
eyes glittering He took a blow said he and sneered

There may have been reasons Diana suggested darkly and Sir Rowlands
eyes narrowed at the hint

Again he recalled the words Richard had let fall that afternoon Wilding
and he were fellow workers in some secret business and Richard had said
that the encounter was treason to that same business whatever it might
be And of what it might be Sir Rowland had grounds upon which to found
at least a guess Had perhaps Wilding acted upon some similar feelings
in avoiding the duel He wondered and when Richard dismissed Dianas
challenge with a fatuous laugh it was Blake who took it up

You speak maam said he as if you knew that there were reasons
and knew too what those reasons might be

Diana looked at Ruth as if for guidance before replying But Ruth sat
calm and seemingly impassive looking straight before her She was
indeed indifferent how much Diana said for in any case the matter
could not remain a secret long Lady Horton silent too and listening
looked a question at her daughter

And so after a pause I know both said Diana her eyes straying
again to Ruth and a subtler man than Blake would have read that glance
and understood that this same reason which he sought so diligently sat
there before him

Richard indeed catching that sly look of his cousins checked his
assurance and stood frowning cogitating Then quite suddenly his
voice harsh

What do you mean Diana he inquired

Diana shrugged and turned her shoulder to him You had best ask Ruth
said she which was an answer more or less plain to both the men

They stood at gaze Richard looking a thought foolish Blake frowning
his heavy lip caught in his strong white teeth

Ruth turned to her brother with an almost piteous attempt at a smile
She sought to spare him pain by excluding from her manner all suggestion
that things were other than she desired

I am betrothed to Mr Wilding said she

Sir Rowland made a sudden forward movement drew a deep breath and as
suddenly stood still Richard looked at his sister as she were mad and
raving Then he laughed between unbelief and derision

It is a jest said he but his accents lacked conviction

It is the truth Ruth assured him quietly

The truth His brow darkened ominouslystupendously for one so fair
The truth you baggage He began and stopped in very fury

She saw that she must tell him all

I promised to wed Mr Wilding this day senight so that he saved your
life and honour she told him calmly and added It was a bargain that
we drove Richard continued to stare at her The thing she told him
was too big to be swallowed at a mouthful he was absorbing it by slow
degrees

So now said Diana you know the sacrifice your sister has made to
save you and when you speak of the apology Mr Wilding tendered you
perhaps youll speak of it in a tone less loud

But the sarcasm was no longer needed Already poor Richard was very
humble his makebelieve spirit all snuffed out He observed at last
how pale and set was his sisters face and he realized something of
the sacrifice she had made Never in all his life was Richard so near
to lapsing from the love of himself never so near to forgetting his
own interests and preferring those of Ruth Lady Horton sat silent her
heart fluttering with dismay and perplexity Heaven had not equipped her
with a spirit capable of dealing with a situation such as this Blake
stood in make believe stolidity dissembling his infinite chagrin and
the stormy emotions warring within him for some signs of which Diana
watched his countenance in vain

You shall not do it cried Richard suddenly He came forward and laid
his hand on his sisters shoulder His voice was almost gentle Ruth
you shall not do this for me You must not

By Heaven no snapped Blake before she could reply You are right
Richard Mistress Westmacott must not be the scapegoat She shall not
play the part of Iphigenia

But Ruth smiled wistfully as she answered him with a question Where is
the help for it

Richard knew where the help for it lay and for oncefor just a
momenthe contemplated danger and even death with equanimity

I can take up this quarrel again he announced I can compel Mr
Wilding to meet me

Ruths eyes looking up at him kindled with pride and admiration It
warmed her heart to hear him speak thus to have this assurance that he
was anything but the coward she had been so disloyal as to deem him no
doubt she had been right in saying that it was his health was the cause
of the palsy he had displayed that morning he was a little wild she
knew inclined to sit overlate at the bottle with advancing manhood
she had no doubt he would overcome this boyish failing Meanwhile
it was this foolish habitnothing morethat undermined the inherent
firmness of his nature And it comforted her generous soul to have this
proof that he was full worthy of the sacrifice she was making for him
Diana watched him in some surprise and never doubted but that his offer
was impulsive and that he would regret it when his ardour had had time
to cool

It were idle said Ruth at lastnot that she quite believed it but
that it was allimportant to her that Richard should not be imperilled
Mr Wilding will prefer the bargain he has made

No doubt growled Blake but he shall be forced to unmake it He
advanced and bowed low before her Madam said he will you grant
me leave to champion your cause and remove this troublesome Mr Wilding
from your path

Dianas eyes narrowed her cheeks paled partly from fear for Blake
partly from vexation at the promptness of an offer that afforded a fresh
and so eloquent proof of the trend of his affections

Ruth smiled at him in a very friendly manner but gently shook her head

I thank you sir said she But it were more than I could permit
This has become a family affair

There was in her tone something which despite its friendliness
gave Sir Rowland his dismissal He was not at best a man of keen
sensibilities yet even so he could not mistake the request to
withdraw that was implicit in her tone and manner He took his leave
registering however in his heart a vow that he would have his way with
Wilding Thus must hethrough her gratitudeassuredly come to have his
way with Ruth

Diana rose and turned to her mother Come she said well speed Sir
Rowland Ruth and Richard would perhaps prefer to remain alone

Ruth thanked her with her eyes Richard standing beside his sister with
bent head and moody gaze did not appear to have heard Thus he remained
until he and his halfsister were alone together then he flung himself
wearily into the seat beside her and took her hand

Ruth he faltered Ruth

She stroked his hand her honest intelligent eyes bent upon him in
a look of pityand to indulge this pity for him she forgot how much
herself she needed pity

Take it not so to heart she urged him her voice low and crooning
as that of a mother to her babe Take it not so to heart Richard
I should have married some day and after all it may well be that Mr
Wilding will make me as good a husband as another I do believe she
added her only intent to comfort Richard that he loves me and if he
loves me surely he will prove kind

He flung himself back with an exclamation of angry pain He was white to
the lips his eyes bloodshot It must not beit shall not beIll not
endure it he cried hoarsely

Richard dear she began recapturing the hand he had snatched from
hers in his gust of emotion

He rose abruptly interrupting her Ill go to Wilding now he cried
his voice resolute He shall cancel this bargain he had no right to
make He shall take up his quarrel with me where it stood before you
went to him

No no Richard you must not she urged him frightened rising too
and clinging to his arm

I will he answered At the worst he can but kill me But at least
you shall not be sacrificed

Sit here Richard she bade him There is something you have not
considered If you die if Mr Wilding kills you she paused

He looked at her and at the repetition of the fate that would probably
await him if he persevered in the course he threatened his purely
emotional courage again began to fail him A look of fear crept
gradually into his face to take the room of the resolution that had been
stamped upon it but a moment since

He swallowed hard What then he asked his voice harsh and obeying
her command and the pressure on his hand he resumed his seat beside
her

She spoke now at length and very gravely dwelling upon the circumstance
that he was the head of the family the last Westmacott of his line
pointing out to him the importance of his existence the insignificance
of her own She was but a girl a thing of small account where the
perpetuation of a family was at issue After all she must marry
somebody some day she repeated and perhaps she had been foolish in
attaching too much importance to the tales she had heard of Mr
Wilding Probably he was no worse than other men and after all he was
a gentleman of wealth and position such a man as half the women in
Somerset might be proud to own for husband

Her arguments and his weaknesshis returning cowardice which made him
lend an ear to those same argumentsprevailed with him at least they
convinced him that he was far too important a person to risk his life in
this quarrel upon which he had so rashly entered He did not say that
he was convinced but he said that he would give the matter thought
hinting that perhaps some other way might present itself of cancelling
the bargain she had made They had a week before them and in any case
he promised readily in answer to her entreatiesfor her faith in
him was a thing unquenchablethat he would do nothing without taking
counsel with her

Meanwhile Diana had escorted Sir Rowland to the main gates of Lupton
House in front of which Miss Westmacotts groom was walking his horse
awaiting him

Sir Rowland said she at parting your chivalry makes you take this
matter too deeply to heart You overlook the possibility that my cousin
may have good reason for not desiring your interference

He looked keenly at this little lady to whom a month ago he had been
on the point of offering marriage His coxcombry might readily have
suggested to him that she was in love with him but that his conscience
and inclinations urged him to assure himself that this was not the case

What shall that mean madam he asked her

Diana hesitated What I have said is plain she answered and it was
clear that she held something back

Sir Rowland flattered himself upon the shrewdness with which he read
her never dreaming that he had but read just what she intended he
should

He stood squarely before her shaking his great head Not plain enough
for me he said Then his tone softened to one of prayer Tell me he
besought her

I cant I cant she cried in feigned distress It were too
disloyal

He frowned He caught her arm and pressed it his heart sick with
jealous alarm What do you mean Tell me tell me Mistress Horton

Diana lowered her eyes Youll not betray me she stipulated

Why no Tell me

She flushed delicately I am disloyal to Ruth she said and yet I am
loath to see you cozened

Cozened quoth he hoarsely his egregious vanity in arms Cozened

Diana explained Ruth was at his house today said she closeted
alone with him for an hour or more

Impossible he cried

Where else was the bargain made she asked and shattered his last
doubt You know that Mr Wilding has not been here

Yet Blake struggled heroically against conviction

She went to intercede for Richard he protested Miss Horton looked
up at him and under her glance Sir Rowland felt that he was a man of
unfathomable ignorance Then she turned aside her eyes and shrugged her
shoulders very eloquently You are a man of the world Sir Rowland You
cannot seriously suppose that any maid would so imperil her good name in
any cause

Darker grew his florid countenance his bulging eyes looked troubled and
perplexed

You mean that she loves him he said between question and assertion

Diana pursed her lips You shall draw your own inference quoth she

He breathed heavily and squared his broad shoulders as one who braces
himself for battle against an element stronger than himself

But her talk of sacrifice he cried

Diana laughed and again he was stung by her contempt of his
perceptions Her brother is set against her marrying him said she
Here was her chance Is it not very plain

Doubt stared from his eyes Why do you tell me this

Because I esteem you Sir Rowland she answered very gently I would
not have you meddle in a matter you cannot mend

Which I am not desired to mend say rather he replied with heavy
sarcasm She would not have my interference He laughed angrily I
think you are right Mistress Diana he said and I think that more
than ever is there the need to kill this Mr Wilding

He took his departure abruptly leaving her scared at the mischief she
had made for him in seeking to save him from it and that very night he
sought out Wilding

But Wilding was from home again Under its placid surface the West
Country was in a ferment And if hitherto Mr Wilding had disdained the
insistent rumours of Monmouths coming his assurance was shaken now by
proof that the Government itself was stirring for four companies of
foot and a troop of horse had been that day ordered to Taunton by the
DeputyLieutenant Wilding was gone with Trenchard to White Lackington
in a vain hope that there he might find news to confirm his persisting
unbelief in any such rashness as was alleged on Monmouths part

So Blake was forced to wait but his purpose suffered nothing by delay

Returning on the morrow he found Mr Wilding at table with Nick
Trenchard and he cut short the greetings of both men He flung his
hata black castor trimmed with a black featherrudely among the
dishes on the board

I have come to ask you Mr Wilding said he to be so good as to
tell me the colour of that hat

Mr Wilding raised one eyebrow and looked aslant at Trenchard whose
weatherbeaten face was suddenly agrin with stupefaction

I could not said Mr Wilding deny an answer to a question set so
courteously He looked up into Blakes flushed and scowling face with
the sweetest and most innocent of smiles Youll no doubt disagree with
me said he but I love to meet a man halfway Your hat sir is as
white as virgin snow

Blakes slow wits were disconcerted for a moment Then he smiled
viciously You mistake Mr Wilding said he My hat is black

Mr Wilding looked more attentively at the object in dispute He was in
a trifling mood and the stupidity of this runagate debtor afforded him
opportunities to indulge it Why true said he now that I come to
look I perceive that it is indeed black

And again was Sir Rowland disconcerted Still he pursued the lesson he
had taught himself

You are mistaken again said he that hat is green

Indeed quoth Mr Wilding like one surprised and he turned to
Trenchard who was enjoying himself What is your own opinion of it
Nick

Thus appealed to Trenchards reply was prompt Why since you ask
me said he my opinion is that its a noisome thing not meet for a
gentlemans table And he took it up and threw it through the window

Sir Rowland was entirely put out of countenance Here was a deliberate
shifting of the quarrel he had come to pick which left him all at sea
It was his duty to himself to take offence at Mr Trenchards action
But that was not the business on which he had come He became angry

Blister me he cried Must I sweep the cloth from the table before
youll understand me

If you were to do anything so unmannerly I should have you flung out
of the house said Mr Wilding and it would distress me so to treat
a person of your station and quality The hat shall serve your purpose
although Mr Trenchards concern for my table has removed it Our
memories will supply its absence What colour did you say it was

I said it was green answered Blake quite ready to keep to the point

Nay I am sure you were wrong said Wilding with a grave air
Although I admit that since it is your own hat you should be the best
judge of its colour I am nevertheless of opinion that it is black

And if I were to say that it is white asked Blake feeling mighty
ridiculous

Why in that case you would be confirming my first impression of it
answered Wilding and Trenchard let fly a burst of laughter at sight
of the baronets furious and bewildered countenance And since we are
agreed on that continued Mr Wilding imperturbable I hope youll
join us at supper

Ill be damned roared Blake if ever I sit at table of yours sir

Ah said Mr Wilding regretfully Now you become offensive

I mean to be said Blake

You astonish me

You lie I dont Sir Rowland answered him in triumph He had got it
out at last

Mr Wilding sat back in his chair and looked at him his face
inexpressibly shocked

Will you of your own accord deprive us of your company Sir Rowland
he wondered or shall Mr Trenchard throw you after your hat

Do you mean gasped the other that youll ask no satisfaction of
me

Not so Mr Trenchard shall wait upon your friends tomorrow and I
hope youll afford us then as felicitous entertainment as you do now

Sir Rowland snorted and turning on his heel made for the door

Give you a good night Sir Rowland Mr Wilding called after him
Walters you rascal light Sir Rowland to the door

Poor Blake went home deeply vexed but it was no more than the beginning
of his humiliation at Mr Wildings handsfor what can be more
humiliating to a quarrelseeking man than to have his enemy refuse to
treat him seriously He and Mr Wilding met next morning and before
noon the tale of it had run through Bridgwater that Wild Wilding was at
his tricks again It made a pretty story how twice he had disarmed and
each time spared the London beau who still insistedeach time more
furiouslyupon renewing the encounter till Mr Wilding had been forced
to run him through the swordarm and thus put him out of all case of
continuing It was a story that heaped ridicule upon Sir Rowland and did
credit to Mr Wilding

Richard heard it and trembled enraged and impotent Ruth heard it and
was stirred despite herself to a feeling of gratitude towards Wilding
for the patience and toleration he had displayed

There for a while the matter rested and the days passed slowly But Sir
Rowlands naturemean at bottomwas spurred to find him some other
way of wiping out the score that lay twixt him and Mr Wilding a score
mightily increased by the shame that Mr Wilding had put upon him in
that encounter from whichwhatever the issuehe had looked to cull
great credit in Ruths eyes

He had been thinking constantly of the incautious words that Richard
had let fall thinking of them in conjunction with the startling rumours
that were now the talk of the whole countryside He laid two and two
together and the four he found them make afforded him some hope Then
he realizedas he might have realized before had he been shrewderthat
Richards mood was one that made him ripe for any villainy He thought
that he was much in error if a treachery existed so black that Richard
would quail before it if it but afforded him the means of ridding
himself and the world of Mr Wilding He was considering how best to
approach the subject when it happened that one night when Richard sat
at play with him in his own lodging the boy grew talkative through
excess of wine It happened naturally enough that Richard sought an
ally in Blake just as Blake sought an ally in Richard Indeed their
fortunesso far as Ruth was concernedwere bound up together The
baronet saw that Richard halffuddled was ripe for any confidences
that might aim at the destruction of his enemy He questioned him
adroitly and drew from him the story of the rising that was being
planned and of the share that Mr Wildingone of the Duke of
Monmouths chief movementmenbore in the business that was toward

When towards midnight Richard Westmacott went home he left in Sir
Rowlands hands an instrument which the latter accounted potential not
only for the destruction of Anthony Wilding but perhaps also for laying
the foundations to the building of his own fortunes anew






CHAPTER VII THE NUPTIALS OF RUTH WESTMACOTT

Here was Sir Rowland Blake in high fettle at knowing himself armed with
a portentous weapon for the destruction of Anthony Wilding Upon closer
inspection of it however he came to realizeas Richard had realized
earlierthat it was doubleedged and that the wielding of it must be
fraught with as much danger for Richard as for their common enemy For
to betray Mr Wilding and the plot would scarce be possible without
betraying young Westmacott and that was unthinkable since to ruin
Richarda thing he would have done with a light heart so far as Richard
was himself concernedwould be to ruin his own hopes of winning Ruth

Therefore during the days that followed Sir Rowland was forced to
fret in idleness what time his wound was healing but if his arm was
invalided his eyes and ears were sound and he remained watchful for an
opportunity to apply the knowledge he had gained Richard mentioned the
subject no more so that Blake almost came to wonder whether the boy
remembered what in his cups he had betrayed

Meanwhile Mr Wilding moved serene and smiling on his way Daily there
were great armfuls of flowers deposited at Lupton Househis lovers
offering to his mistressand no day went by but that some richer gift
accompanied them Now it was a collar of brilliants anon a rope of
pearls again a priceless ring that had been Mr Wildings mothers
Ruth received with reluctance these pledges of his undesired affection
It were idle to reject them considering that she was to marry him yet
it hurt her sorely to retain them On her side she made no dispositions
for the marriage but went about her daily tasks as though she were to
remain a maid at Lupton House for a time as yet indefinite

In Diana Wilding hadthough he was far from guessing itan entirely
exceptional ally Lady Horton too was favourably disposed towards him
A foolish worldly woman who never probed beneath lifes surface nor
indeed dreamed that anything existed in life beyond that to which her
five senses testified she was content placidly to contemplate the
advantages that must accrue to her niece from this alliance

And so mother and daughter in Mr Wildings absence pleaded his cause
with his refractory brideelect But they pleaded it to little real
purpose Something perhaps they achieved in that Ruth grew more or
less resigned to the fate that awaited her By repeating to herself the
arguments she had employed to Richardthat she must wed some day and
that Mr Wilding would prove no doubt as good a husband as anothershe
came in a measure to believe them

Richard meanwhile appeared to avoid her Lacking the courage to adopt
the heroic measures which at first he had promised yet had he grace
enough to take shame at his inaction But if he was idle so far as
Mr Wilding was concerned there was no lack of work for him in other
connections The clouds of war were gathering in that summer sky and
about to loose the storm gestating in them upon that fair country of
the West and young Westmacott committed as he stood to the Duke of
Monmouths party was forced to take his share in the surreptitious
bustle that was toward He was away two days in that week having been
summoned to a meeting of the leading gentlemen of the party at White
Lackington where he was forced into the unwelcome company of his future
brotherinlaw to meet with courteous deferential treatment from that
imperturbable gentleman

Wilding indeed seemed to have forgotten that any quarrel had ever
existed between them For the rest he came and went supremely calm as
if he were and knew himself to be most welcome at Lupton House Thrice
in the course of that week of waiting he rode over from Zoyland Chase
to pay his duty to Mistress Westmacott and Ruth was persuaded on each
occasion by her aunt and cousin to receive him Indeed how could she
well refuse

His manner was ever all that could be desired Gallant affectionate
deferential He was in word and look and tone Ruths most obedient
servant Had she been less prejudiced she must have admired the
admirable restraint with which he kept all exultation from his manner
for after all it is difficult to force a victory as he had forced his
and not to triumph

It is to be feared that during that week he neglected a good deal of his
duty to the Duke leaving Trenchard to supply his place and undertake
tasks of a seditious nature that should have been his own

At heart however in spite of the stories current and the militia at
Taunton Wilding remained convincedas did most of the other leading
partisans of the Protestant Causethat no such madness as this
premature landing could be in contemplation by the Duke Besides were
it so they must unfailingly have definite word of it and they had
none

Trenchard was less assured but Wilding laughed at the old rakes
forebodings and serenely went about the business of his marriage

On the eve of the wedding he paid Ruth his last visit in the quality
of a lover and was received by her in the garden He found her looking
paler than her wont and there was a cloud of sadness on her brow a
haunting sadness in her eyes It touched him to the soul and for a
moment he wavered in his purpose He stood beside hershe seated on
the old lichened seatand a silence fell between them during which
Mr Wildings conscience wrestled with his stronger passion It was his
habit to be glib talking incessantly what time he was in her company
and seeing to it that his talk was shallow and touched at nothing
belonging to the deeps of human life Thus was it perhaps that this
sudden and enduring silence affected her most oddly it was as if she
had absorbed some notion of what was passing in his mind She looked up
suddenly into his face so white and so composed Their eyes met and he
stooped to her suddenly his long brown ringlets tumbling forward She
feared his kiss yet never moved staring up with fixed dilated eyes as
if fascinated by his dark brooding gaze He paused hovering above her
upturned face as hovers the hawk above the dove

Child he said at last and his voice was soft and winning from very
sadness child why do you fear me

The truth of it went home to her She feared him she feared the
strength that lay behind that calm she feared the masterfulness of his
wild but inscrutably hidden nature she was afraid to surrender to
such a man as this afraid that in the hot crucible of his love her own
nature would be dissolved transmuted and rendered part of his Yet
though the truth was now made plain to her she thrust it from her

I do not fear you said she and her voice at least rang fearlessly

Do you hate me then he asked Her glance grew troubled and fell
away from his it sought the calm of the river gleaming golden in the
sunset There was a pause Wilding sighed heavily and straightened
himself from his bending posture

You should not have sought thus to compel me she said presently

I own it he answered a thought bitterly I own it Yet what hope had
I but in compulsion She returned him no answer You see he said
with increasing bitterness you see that had I not seized the chance
that was mine to win you by compulsion I had not won you at all

It might said she have been better so for both of us

Better for neither he replied Ah think it not In time I swear
you shall not think it For you shall come to love me Ruth he added
with a note of such assurance that she turned to meet again his gaze
He answered the wordless question of her eyes There is said he no
love of man for woman so that the man be not wholly unworthy so that
his passion be sincere and strong that can fail in time to arouse
response She smiled a little pitiful smile of unbelief Were I a
boy he rejoined his earnestness vibrating now in a voice that was
usually so calm and level offering you protestations of a callow
worship you might have cause to doubt me But I am a man Rutha
tried and haply a sinful man alasa man who needs you and who will
have you at all costs

At all costs she echoed and her lip took on a curl And you call
this egotism by the name of love No doubt you are right she continued
with an irony that stung him for love it islove of yourself

And is not all love of another founded upon the love of self he asked
her startling her with a question that revealed to her clearsighted
mind a truth undreamed of When some dayplease HeavenI come to find
favour in your eyes and you come to love me what will it mean but that
you have come to find me necessary to yourself and to your happiness
Would you deny me now your love if you felt that you had need of mine
I love you because I love myself you say I grant it you But youll
confess that if you do not love me yet it is for the same reason and
that when you do come to love me the reason will be still the same

You are very sure that I shall come to love you said she shifting
womanlike the ground of argument now that she found insecure the place
on which at first she had taken her stand

Were I not think you I should compel you to the church tomorrow

She trembled at his calm assurance It was as if she almost feared that
what he said might come to pass

Since you bear such faith in your heart said she were it not
nobler more generous that you should set yourself to win me first and
wed me afterwards

It is the course I should myself prefer he answered quietly But
it is a course denied me I was viewed here with disfavour almost
denied your house What chance had I whilst I might not come near you
whilst your mind was poisoned against me by the idle vicious prattle
that goes round and round the countryside increasing ever in bulk from
constant repetition

Do you say that these tales are groundless she asked with a sudden
lifting of the eyes a sudden keen eagerness that did not escape him

I would to God I could he cried since from your manner I see that
would improve me in your sight But there is just sufficient truth in
them to forbid me as I am I hope a gentleman from giving them a full
denial Yet in what am I worse than my fellows Are you of those who
think a husband should come to them as one whose youth has been the
youth of cloistered nun Heaven knows I am not one to draw parallels
twixt myself and any other yet you compel me Whilst you deny me you
receive this fellow Blakea London nightscourer a broken gamester
who has given his creditors legbail and who woos you that with your
fortune he may close the doors of the debtors gaol thats open to
receive him

This is unworthy in you she exclaimed her tone indignantso
indignant that he experienced his first pang of jealousy

It would be were I his rival he answered quietly But I am not I
have saved you from becoming the prey of such as he by forcing you to
marry me

That I may become the prey of such as you instead was her retort

He looked at her a moment smiling sadly Then with pardonable
selfesteem when we think of what manner of man it was with whom he now
compared himself Surely said he it is better to become the prey of
the lion than the jackal

To the victim it can matter little she answered and he saw the tears
gathering in her eyes

Compassion moved him It rose in arms to batter down his will and in a
weaker man had triumphed Mr Wilding bent his knee and went down beside
her

I swear he said impassionedly that as my wife you shall never count
yourself a victim You shall be honoured by all men but by none more
deeply than by him who will ever strive to be worthy of the proud title
of your husband He took her hand and kissed it reverentially He rose
and looked at her Tomorrow he said and bowing low before her went
his way leaving her with emotions that found their vent in tears but
defied her maiden mind to understand them

The morrow came her weddingdaya sunny day of early June and
Ruthassisted by Diana and Lady Hortonmade preparation for her
marriage as spirited women have made preparation for the scaffold
determined to show the world a brave serene exterior The sacrifice was
necessary for Richards sake That was a thing long since determined
Yet it would have been some comfort to her to have had Richard at her
side it would have lent her strength to have had his kiss of thanks
for the holocaust which for him she was making of all that a woman holds
most dear and sacred But Richard was awayhe had been absent since
yesterday and none could tell her where he tarried

With Lady Horton and Diana she took her way to Saint Marys Church at
noon and there she found Mr Wildingvery fine in a suit of skyblue
satin laced with silverawaiting her And with him was old Lord
Gervase Scoresby his friend and cousin the very incarnation of
benignity and ruddy health

For a wonder Nick Trenchard was not at Mr Wildings side But Nick
had definitely refused to be of the party emphasizing his refusal by
certain choice reflections wholly unflattering to the married state

Some idlers of the town were the only witnessesand little did they
guess the extent of the tragedy they were witnessing There was no
music and the ceremony was brief and soon at an end The only touch of
joy of festiveness was that afforded by the choice blooms with which
Mr Wilding had smothered nave and choir and altarrails Their perfume
hung heavy as incense in the temple

Who giveth this woman to be married to this man droned the parsons
voice and Wilding smiled defiantly a smile which seemed to answer him
No man I have taken her for myself

Lord Gervase stood forward as her sponsor and as in a dream Ruth felt
her hand lying in Mr Wildings cool firm grasp

The ecclesiastics voice droned on his voice hanging like the hum of
some great Insect upon the scented air It was accomplished and they
were welded each to the other until death should part them

Down the festooned nave she came on his arm her step unfaltering
her face calm black misery in her heart Behind followed her aunt and
cousin and Lord Gervase On Mr Wildings aquiline face a pale smile
glimmered like a beam of moonlight upon tranquil waters and it abode
there until they reached the porch and were suddenly confronted by Nick
Trenchard red of face for once perspiring excited and duststained
from head to foot

He had arrived that very instant and urged by the fearful news that
brought him he had come resolved to pluck Wilding from the altar be the
ceremony done or not But in that he reckoned without Mr Wildingfor
he should have known him better than to have hoped to succeed He
stepped forward now and gripped him with his dusty glove by the
sleeve of his shimmering bridegrooms coat His voice came harsh with
excitement and smouldering rage

A word with you Anthony

Mr Wilding turned placidly to regard him What now he asked his
brides hand retained in the crook of his elbow

Treachery snapped Trenchard in a whisper Hell and damnation Step
aside man

Mr Wilding turned to Lord Gervase and begged of him to take charge of
Mistress Wilding I deplore this interruption he told her no whit
ruffled by what he had heard But I shall rejoin you soon Meanwhile
his lordship will do the honours for me This last he said with his
eyes moving to Lady Horton and her daughter

Lord Gervase in some surprise but overruled by his cousins calm
took the bride on his arm and led her from the churchyard to the waiting
carriage To this he handed her and after her her aunt and cousin
Then mounting himself they drove away leaving Wilding and Trenchard
among the tombstones whither the messenger of evil had meanwhile led
his friend Trenchard rapped out his story briefly

Shenke said he who was riding from Lyme with letters for you from
the Duke was robbed of his dispatches late last night a mile or so this
side Taunton

Highwaymen inquired Mr Wilding his tone calm though his glance had
hardened

Highwaymen No Government agents belike There were two of them he
saysfor I have the tale from himselfand they met him at the Hare and
Hounds at Taunton where he stayed to sup last night One of them gave
him the password and he conceived him to be a friend But afterwards
growing suspicious he refused to tell them too much They followed
him it appears and on the road they overtook and fell upon him they
knocked him from his horse possessed themselves of the contents of his
wallet and left him for deadwith his head broken

Mr Wilding drew a sharp breath His wits worked quickly He was he
realized in deadly peril One thought he gave to Ruth If the worst
came to pass here was one who would rejoice in her freedom The
reflection cut through him like a sword He would be loath to die
until he had taught her to regret him Then his mind returned to what
Trenchard had told him

You said a Government agent he mused slowly How would a Government
agent know the password

Trenchards mouth fell open I had not thought he began Then ended
with an oath Tis a traitor from inside

Wilding nodded It must be one of those who met at White Lackington
three nights ago he answered

Idlersthe witnesses of the weddingwere watching them with interest
from the path and others from over the low wall of the churchyard
as well they might for Mr Wildings behaviour was for a bridegroom
extraordinary Trenchard did not relish the audience

We had best away said he Indeed he added we had best out
of England altogether before the hue and cry is raised The bubbles
pricked

Wildings hand fell on his arm and its grasp was steady Wildings eyes
met his and their gaze was calm

Where have you bestowed this messenger quoth he

He is here in Bridgwater in bed at the Bell Inn whence he sent for
you to Zoyland Chase Suspecting trouble I rode to him at once myself

Come then said Wilding Well go talk with him This matter needs
probing ere we decide on flight You do not seem to have sought to
discover who were the thieves nor other matters that it may be of use
to know

Rat me swore Trenchard I was in haste to bring you news of
it Besides there were other things to talk of There is news that
Albemarle has gone to Exeter and that Sir Edward Phelips and Colonel
Luttrell have been ordered to Taunton by the King

Mr Wilding stared at him with sudden dismay

Odso he exclaimed Is King James taking fright at last Then
he shrugged his shoulders and laughed Pshaw he cried They are
starting at a shadow

Heaven send prayed Trenchard that the shadow does not prove to have
a substance immediately behind it

Folly said Wilding When Monmouth comes indeed we shall not lack
forewarning Come he added briskly Well see this messenger and
endeavour to discover who were these fellows that beset him And he
drew Trenchard from among the tombstones to the open path and thus from
the churchyard and the eyes of the gaping onlookers






CHAPTER VIII BRIDE AND GROOM

And so the bridegroom in all his wedding finery made his way with
Trenchard to the Bell Inn in the High Street whilst his bride
escorted by Lord Gervase was being driven to Zoyland Chase of which
she was now the mistress

But she was not destined just yet to cross its threshold For scarcely
were they over the river when a horseman barred their way and called
upon the driver to pull up Lady Horton in a panic huddled herself
in the great coach and spoke of tobymen whilst Lord Gervase thrust
his head from the window to discover that the rider who stayed their
progress was Richard Westmacott His lordship hailed the boy who
thereupon walked his horse to the carriage door

Lord Gervase said he will you bid the coachman put about and drive
to Lupton House

Lord Gervase stared at him in hopeless bewilderment Drive to Lupton
House he echoed The more he saw of this odd wedding the less he
understood of it It seemed to the placid old gentleman that he was
fallen among a parcel of Bedlamites Surely sir it is for Mistress
Wilding to say whither she will be driven and he drew in his head and
turned to Ruth for her commands But bewildered herself she had none
to give him It was her turn to lean from the carriage window to ask her
brother what he meant

I mean you are to drive home again said he There is something
I must tell you When you have heard me it shall be yours to decide
whether you will proceed or not to Zoyland Chase

Hers to decide How was that possible What could he mean She pressed
him with some such questions

It means in short he answered impatiently that I hold your
salvation in my hands For the rest this is not the time or place to
tell you more Bid the fellow put about

Ruth sat back and looked once more at her companions But from none did
she receive the least helpful suggestion Lady Horton made great prattle
to little purpose Lord Gervase followed her example whilst Diana
whose alert if trivial mind was the one that might have offered
assistance sat silent Ruth pondered She bethought her of Trenchards
sudden arrival at Saint Marys his duststained person and excited
manner and of how he had drawn Mr Wilding aside with news that seemed
of moment And now her brother spoke of saving her it was a little late
for that she thought Outside the coach his voice still urged her and
it grew peevish and angry as was usual when he was crossed In the end
she consented to do his will If she were to fathom this mystery that
was thickening about her there seemed to be no other course She turned
to Lord Gervase

Will you do as Richard says she begged him

His lordship blew out his chubby cheeks in his astonishment he
hesitated a moment thinking of his cousin Wilding then with a shrug
he leaned from the window and gave the order she desired The carriage
turned about and with Richard following lumbered back across the bridge
and through the town to Lupton House At the door Lord Gervase took his
leave of them He had acted as Ruth had bidden him but he had no wish
to be further involved in this affair whatever it might portend Rather
was it his duty at once to go acquaint Mr Wildingif he could find
himwith what was taking place and leave it to Mr Wilding to take
what measures might seem best to him He told them so and having told
them left them

Richard begged to be alone with his sister and alone they passed
together into the library His manner was restless he trembled with
excitement and his eyes glittered almost feverishly

You may have thought Ruth that I was resigned to your marriage with
this fellow Wilding he began or that for other reasons I thought it
wiser not to interfere If you thought that you wronged me IBlake and
Ihave been at work for you during these last days and I rejoice
to say our labours have not been idle His manner grew assertive
boastful as he proceeded

You know of course said she that I am married

He made a gesture of disdain No matter said he exultantly

It matters something I think she answered O Richard Richard why
did you not come to me sooner if you possessed the means of sparing me
this thing

He shrugged impatiently her remonstrance seemed to throw him out of
temper Oons he cried I came as soon as was ever possible and
depend upon it I am not come too late Indeed I think I am come in the
very nick of time He drew a sheet of paper from an inside pocket of
his coat and slapped it down upon the table There is the wherewithal
to hang your fine husband he announced in triumph

She recoiled To hang him she echoed With all her aversion to Mr
Wilding it was plain she did not wish him hanged

Aye to hang him Richard repeated and drew himself to the full
height of his short stature in pride at the thing he had achieved Read
it

She took the paper almost mechanically and for some moments she studied
the crabbed signature before realizing whose it was Then she started

From the Duke of Monmouth she exclaimed

He laughed Read it he bade her again though there was no need for
the injunction for already she was deciphering the crabbed hand and
the atrocious spellingfor His Grace of Monmouths education had been
notoriously neglected The letter which was dated from The Hague was
addressed To my good friend W at Bridgwater It began Sir spoke
of the imminent arrival of His Grace in the West and gave certain
instructions for the collection of arms and the work of preparing men
for enlistment in his Cause ending with protestations of His Graces
friendship and esteem

Ruth read the epistle twice before its treasonable nature was made clear
to her before she understood the thing that was foreshadowed Then
she raised troubled eyes to her brothers face and in answer to the
question of her glance he made clear to her the shrewd means by which
they had become possessed of this weapon that should destroy their enemy
Mr Wilding

Blake and he forewarnedhe said not howof the coming of this
messenger had lain in wait for him at the Hare and Hounds at Taunton
They had sought at first to become possessed of the letter without
violence But having failed in this through having aroused the
messengers suspicions they had been forced to follow and attack him on
a lonely stretch of road where they had robbed him of the contents of
his wallet Richard added that the letter was no doubt one of several
sent over by Monmouth to some friend at Lyme for distribution among his
principal agents in the West It was regrettable that they should
have endeavoured to take gentle measures with the courier as this had
forewarned him and he had apparently been led to remove the
letters outer wrapperwhich no doubt bore Wildings full name and
addressagainst the chance of such an attack as they had made upon him
Nevertheless as it was that letter to my good friend W backed by
Richards and Blakes evidence of the destination intended for it would
be more than enough to lay Mr Wilding safely by the heels

I would to Heaven he repeated in conclusion I could have come in
time to save you from becoming his wife But at least it is in my power
to make you very speedily his widow

That said Ruth still retaining the letter is what you propose to
do

What else

She shook her head It must not be Richard she said Ill not
consent to it

Taken aback he stared at her then laughed unpleasantly Odds my life
Are you in love with the man Have you been fooling us

No she answered But Ill be no party to his murder

Murder quotha Who talks of murder Her shrewd eyes searched his
face How came you by your knowledge that this courier rode to Mr
Wilding she asked him suddenly and the swift change that overspread
his countenance showed her that she had touched him in a tender spot
assured her of the thing she had suddenly come to suspecta suspicion
which at the same time started from and explained much that had been
mysterious in Richards ways of late You had knowledge of this
conspiracy she pursued answering her own question before he had time
to speak because you were one of the conspirators

At least I am so no longer he blurted out

I thank Heaven for that Richard for your life is very dear to me But
it would ill become you to make such use as this of the knowledge
you came by in that manner It were a Judass act He would have
interrupted her but her manner dominated him You will leave this
letter with me Richard she continued

Damn me no he began

Ah yes Richard she insisted You will give it to me and I shall
thank you for the gift It shall prove a weapon for my salvation never
fear

It shall indeed he cried with an ugly laugh when I have ridden to
Exeter to lay it before Albemarle

Not so she answered him It shall be a weapon of defencenot of
offence It shall stand as a buckler between me and Mr Wilding Trust
me I shall know how to use it

But there is Blake to consider he expostulated growing angry I am
pledged to him

Your first duty is to me

Tut he interrupted Blake feels that he owes it to his loyalty to
lay this letter before the LordLieutenant and for that matter so do
I

Sir Rowland would not cross my wishes in this she answered him

Folly he cried now thoroughly aroused Give me that letter

Nay Richard she answered and waved him back

But he advanced nevertheless

Give it me he bade her waxing fierce Gad It was folly to have
told you of it I had not done so but that I never thought you such a
fool as to oppose yourself to the thing we intend

Listen Richard she besought him

But he was grown insensible to pleadings

Give me that letter he insisted and caught her wrist Her other
hand howeverthe one that held the sheetwas already behind her back

The door was suddenly thrust open and Diana appeared Ruth she
announced Mr Wilding is here

At the mention of that name Richard let her free Wilding he
ejaculated his fierceness all blown out of him He had imagined that
already Mr Wilding would be in full flight Was the fellow mad

He is following me said Diana and indeed a step could be heard in
the passage

The letter growled Richard in a frenzy between fear and anger now
Give it me Give it me do you hear

Sh Youll betray yourself she cried He is here

And at that same moment Mr Wildings tall figure still arrayed in his
bridegrooms finery of skyblue satin loomed in the doorway He was
serene and calm as ever Neither the discovery of the plot by the
abstraction of the messengers letter nor Ruths strange conductof
which he had heard from Lord Gervasehad sufficed to ruffle outwardly
at least the inscrutable serenity of his air and manner He paused
to make his bow then advanced into the room with a passing glance at
Richard still spurred and booted and all duststained

You appear to have ridden far Dick said he smiling and Richard
shivered in spite of himself at the mocking note that seemed to ring
faintly at the words I saw your friend Sir Rowland in the garden
he added I think he waits for you

Though Richard could not fail to apprehend the implied dismissal he
was minded at first to disregard it But Mr Wilding turning held the
door addressing Diana

Mistress Horton said he will you give us leave

Diana curtsied and passed out and Mr Wildings eye falling upon the
lingering Richard at that moment Richard thought it best to follow her
example But he went with rage in his heart at being forced to leave
that precious document behind him

As Mr Wilding his back to her a moment closed the door Ruth slipped
the paper hurriedly into the bosom of her lownecked gown He turned to
her calm but very grave and his dark eyes seemed to reproach her

This is ill done Ruth said he

Ill done or well done she answered him done it is and shall so
remain

He raised his brows Ah said he I appear then to have
misapprehended the situation From what Gervase told me I understood it
was your brother forced you to return

Not forced sir she answered him

Induced then said he It but remains me to induce you to repair
what I think was a mistake

She shook her head I have returned home for good said she

Youll pardon me said he that I am so egotistical as to prefer
Zoyland Chase to Lupton House Despite the manifold attractions of the
latter I do not intend to take up my abode here

You are not asked to

What then

She hated him for the smile for his masterful air which seemed to
imply that he humoured her because he scorned to use authority but that
when he did use it hers must it be to obey him Again she felt that
everlasting calm arguing such latent forces was the thing she hated
most in him

I think I had best be plain with you said she I have fulfilled my
part of the bargain that we made I intend to do no more I promised
that if you spared my brother I would go to the altar with you today
I have carried out my contract to the letter It is at an end

Indeed said he I think it has not yet begun He advanced towards
her and took her hand She yielded it unwilling though she was This
is unworthy of you madam said he his tone grave and deferential
You think to escape fulfilling the spirit of your bargain by adhering
to the letter of it Not so he ended and shook his head smiling
gently The carriage is still at your door You return with me to
Zoyland Chase to take possession of your home

You mistake said she and tore her hand from his You say that what
I have done is unworthy I admit it but it is with unworthiness that we
must combat unworthiness Was your attitude towards me less unworthy

Ill make amends for it if youll come home said he

My home is here You cannot compel me

I should be loath to he admitted sighing

You cannot she insisted

I think I can said he There is a law

A law that will hang you if you invoke it she cut in quickly This
much can I safely promise you

She had need to say no more to tell him everything At all times half a
word was as much to Mr Wilding as a whole sentence to another She saw
the tightening of his lips the hardening of his eyes beyond which he
gave no other sign that she had hit him

I see said he It is another bargain that you make I do suspect
there is some traders blood in the Westmacott veins Let us be clear
You hold the wherewithal to ruin me and you will use it if I insist
upon my husbands rights Is it not so

She nodded in silence surprised at the rapidity with which he had read
the situation

I admit said he that you have me between sword and wall He
laughed shortly Let me know more he begged her Am I to understand
that so long as I leave you in peaceso long as I do not insist upon
your becoming my wife in more than nameyou will not wield the weapon
that you hold

You are to understand so she answered

He took a turn in the room very thoughtful Not of himself was he
thinking now but of the Duke of Monmouth Trenchard had told him some
ugly truths that morning of how in his lovemaking he appeared to have
shipwrecked the Cause ere it was well launched If this letter got
to Whitehall there was no gaugingignorant as he was of what was in
itthe ruin that might follow but they had reason to fear the worst
He saw his duty to the Duke most clearly and he breathed a prayer of
thanks that Richard had chosen to put that letter to such a use as this
He knew himself checkmated but he was a man who knew how to bear defeat
in a becoming manner He turned suddenly

The letter is in your hands he inquired

It is she answered

May I see it he asked

She shook her headnot daring to show it or betray its whereabouts lest
he should use force to become possessed of ita thing indeed that was
very far from his purpose

He considered a moment his mind intent now rather upon the Dukes
interest than his own

You know quoth he the desperate enterprise to which I stand
committed But it is a bargain between us that you do not betray me nor
that enterprise so long as I leave you rid of my presence

That is the bargain I propose said she

He looked at her a moment with hungry eyes and she found his glance
almost more than she could bear so strong was its appeal Besides
it may be that she was a thought beglamoured by the danger in which he
stood which seemed to invest him with a certain heroic dignity

Ruth he said at length it may well be that that which you desire
may speedily come to pass it may well be that in the course of this
rebellion that is hatching you may be widowed But at least I know that
if my head falls it will not be my wife who has betrayed me to the axe
For that much believe me I am supremely grateful

He advanced He took her unresisting hand again and bore it to his lips
bowing low before her Then erect and graceful he turned on his heel and
left her






CHAPTER IX MR TRENCHARDS COUNTERSTROKE

Now however much it might satisfy Mr Wilding to have Ruths word for
it that so long as he left her in peace neither he nor the Cause had any
betrayal to fear from her Mr Trenchard was of a very different mind

He fumed and swore and worked himself into a very passion Zoons
man he cried it would mean utter ruin to you if that letter reached
Whitehall

I realize it but my mind is easy I have her promise

A womans promise snorted Trenchard and proceeded with great
circumstance of expletives to damn everything that daggled a
petticoat

Your fears are idle Wilding assured him What she says she will
do

And her brother quoth Trenchard Have you bethought you of that
canarybird Hell know the letters whereabouts He has cause to fear
you more than ever now Are you sure hell not be making use of it to
lay you by the heels

Mr Wilding smiled upon the fury provoked by Trenchards concern and
love for him She has promised he said with an insistent faith that
was fuel to Trenchards anger and I can depend her word

So cannot I snapped his friend

The thing that plagues me most said Wilding ignoring the remark is
that we are kept in ignorance of the letters contents at a time when we
most long for news Not a doubt but it would have enabled us to set our
minds at ease on the score of these foolish rumours

Ayeor else confirmed them said pessimistic Trenchard He wagged his
head They say the Duke has put to sea already

Folly Wilding protested

Whitehall thinks otherwise What of the troops at Taunton

More folly

WellI would you had that letter

At least said Wilding I have the superscription and we know from
Shenke that no name was mentioned in the letter itself

Theres evidence enough without it Trenchard reminded him and fell
soon after into abstraction turning over in his mind a notion with
which he had suddenly been inspired That notion kept Trenchard secretly
occupied for a couple of days but in the end he succeeded in perfecting
it

Now it befell that towards dusk one evening early in the week Richard
Westmacott went abroad alone as was commonly his habit his goal being
the Saracens Head where he and Sir Rowland spent many a night over
wine and cardsto Sir Rowlands moderate profit for he had not played
the pigeon in town so long without having acquired sufficient knowledge
to enable him to play the rook in the country As Westmacott was passing
up the High Street a black shadow fell athwart the light that streamed
from the door of the Bell Inn and out through the doorway lurched Mr
Trenchard a thought unsteadily to hurtle so violently against Richard
that he broke the long stem of the white clay pipe he was carrying Now
Richard was not to know that Mr Trenchardhaving informed himself of
Mr Westmacotts evening habitshad been waiting for the past halfhour
in that doorway hoping that Mr Westmacott would not depart this evening
from his usual custom Another thing that Mr Westmacott was not to
knowconsidering his youthwas the singular histrionic ability which
this old rake had displayed in those younger days of his when he had
been a player and the further circumstance that he had excelled in
those parts in which ebriety was to be counterfeited Indeed we have it
on the word of no less an authority on theatrical matters than Mr Pepys
that Mr Nicholas Trenchards appearance as Pistol in Henry IV in the
year of the blessed Restoration was the talk alike of town and court

Mr Trenchard steadied himself from the impact and swearing a round
and awful Elizabethan oath accused the other of being drunk then
struck an attitude to demand with truculence Would ye take the wall o
me sir

Richard hastened to make himself known to this turbulent roysterer who
straightway forgot his grievance to take Westmacott affectionately by
the hand and overwhelm him with apologies And that done Trenchardwho
affected the condition known as maudlin drunkmust needs protest almost
in tears how profound was his love for Richard and insist that the boy
return with him to the Bell Inn that they might pledge each other

Richard himself sober was contemptuous of Trenchard so obviously
obfuscated At first it was his impulse to excuse himself as possibly
Blake might be already waiting for him but on second thoughts
remembering that Trenchard was Mr Wildings most intimate famulus it
occurred to him that by a little crafty questioning he might succeed in
smoking Mr Wildings intentions in the matter of that letterfor from
his sister he had failed to get satisfaction So he permitted himself to
be led indoors to a table by the window which stood vacant There were
at the time a dozen guests or so in the commonroom Trenchard bawled
for wine and brandy and for all that he babbled in an irresponsible
foolish manner of all things that were of no matter yet not the most
adroit of pumping could elicit from him any such information as Richard
sought Perforce young Westmacott must remain plying him with more and
more drinkand being plied in his turnto the end that he might not
waste the occasion

An hour later found Richard much the worse for wear and Trenchard
certainly no better Richard forgot his purpose forgot that Blake
waited for him at the Saracens Head And now Trenchard seemed to be
pulling himself together

I want to talk to you Richard said he and although thick there was
in his voice a certain impressive quality that had been absent hitherto
S a rumour current He lowered his voice to a whisper almost and
leaning across took his companion by the arm He hiccoughed noisily
then began again S a rumour current sweetheart that youre
disaffected

Richard started and his mind flapped and struggled like a trapped bird
to escape the meshes of the wine to the end that he might convincingly
defend himself from such an imputationso dangerously true

S a lie he gasped

Trenchard shut one eye and owlishly surveyed his companion with the
other They say he added that youre for forsaking Dukes party

Villainous Richard protested Ill sli throat of any man t says
so And draining the pewter at his elbow he smashed it down on the
table to emphasize his seriousness

Trenchard replenished it with the utmost promptness then sat back in
his tall chair and pulled a moment at the fresh pipe with which he had
equipped himself

I think I espy he quoted presently virtue and valour crouched
in thine eye And yet and yet if I had cause to think it
true Id Id run you through the vitalsjus so and he prodded
Richards waistcoat with the point of his pipestem His swarthy face
darkened his eyes glittered fiercely Are ye sure yere norrer foul
traitor he demanded suddenly Are y sure for if yere not

He left the terrible menace unuttered but it was none the less
understood It penetrated the vinous fog that beset the brain of
Richard and startled him

Swear Im not he cried Swear mos solemnly Im not

Swear echoed Trenchard and his scowl grew darker still Swear A
man may swear and yet liea man may smile and smile and be a villain
Ill have proof of your loyalty to us Ill have proof or as theres a
heaven above and a hell below Ill rip you up

His mien was terrific and his voice the more threatening in that it was
not raised above a whisper

Richard sat back appalled afraid

Wha what proofll satisfy you he asked

Trenchard considered it pulling at his pipe again Pledge me the
Duke said he at length Thers truth n wine Pledge me the Duke and
confusion to His Majesty the goldfinch Richard reached for his pewter
glad that the test was to be so light Up on your feet man grumbled
Trenchard On your feet and see that your words have a ring of truth
in them

Richard did as he was bidden the little reason left him being
concentrated wholly on the convincing of his fellow tippler He rose to
his feet so unsteadily that his chair fell over with a bang He never
heeded it but others in the room turned at the sound and a hush fell
in the chamber Dominating this came Richards voice strident with
intensity if thick of utterance

Down with Popery and God save the Protestant Duke he cried Down
with Popery And he looked at Trenchard for applause and assurance
that Trenchard no longer thought there was cause to quarrel with him

Behind him there was a stir in the room that went unheeded by the boy
Men nudged their neighbours some looked frightened and some grinned at
the treasonable words

A swift change came over Trenchard His drunkenness fell from him like
a discarded mantle He sat like a man amazed Then he heaved himself to
his feet in a fury and smashed down his pipestem on the wooden table
sending its fragments flying

Damn me he roared Have I sat at table with a traitor And he
thrust at Richard with his open palm lightly yet with sufficient force
to throw Richard off his precarious balance and send him sprawling on
the sanded floor Men rose from the tables about and approached them
some few amused but the majority very grave Dodsley the landlord
came hurrying to assist Richard to his feet

Mr Westmacott he whispered in the rash fools ear you were best
away

Richard stood up leaning his full weight upon the arm the landlord had
about his waist He passed a hand over his brow as if to brush aside
the veil that obscured his wits What had happened What had he said
What had Trenchard done Why did these fellows stand and gape at him He
heard his companions voice raised to address the company

Gentlemen he heard him say I trust there is none present will
impute to me any share in such treasonable sentiments as Mr Westmacott
has expressed But if there is any who questions my loyalty I have
a convincing argument for himin my scabbard And he struck his
swordhilt with his fist

Then he clapped on his hat aslant over the locks of his golden wig
and taking up his whip he moved with leisurely dignity towards the
door He looked back with a sardonic smile at the ado he was leaving
behind him listened a moment to the voices that already were being
raised in excitement then closed the door and made his way briskly
to the stableyard where he called for his horse He rode out of
Bridgwater ten minutes later and took the road to Taunton as the moon
was rising big and yellow over the hills on his left He reached Taunton
towards ten oclock that night having ridden helltoleather His
first visit was to the Hare and Hounds where Blake and Westmacott had
overtaken the courier His next to the house where Sir Edward Phelips
and Colonel Luttrellthe gentlemen lately ordered to Taunton by His
Majestyhad their lodging

The fruits of Mr Trenchards extraordinary behaviour that night were
to be seen at an early hour on the following day when a constable and
three tythingmen came with a LordLieutenants warrant to arrest Mr
Richard Westmacott on a charge of high treason They found the young man
still abed and most guilty was his panic when they bade him rise and
dress himselfthough little did he dream of the full extent to which
Mr Trenchard had enmeshed him or indeed that Mr Trenchard had any
hand at all in this affair What time he was getting into his clothes
with a tythingman outside his door and another on guard under his
window the constable and his third myrmidon made an exhaustive search
of the house All they found of interest was a letter signed Monmouth
which they took from the secret drawer of a secretary in the library
but that it seemed was all they sought for having found it they
proceeded no further with their reckless and destructive ransacking

With that letter and the person of Richard Westmacott the constable and
his men took their departure and rode back to Taunton leaving alarm
and sore distress at Lupton House In her despair poor Ruth was all for
following her brother in the hope that at least by giving evidence
of how that letter came into his possession she might do something to
assist him But knowing as she did that he had had his share in the
treason that was hatching she had cause to fear that his guilt would
not lack for other proofs It was Diana who urged her to repair instead
to the only man upon whose resource she might depend provided he were
willing to exert it That man was Anthony Wilding and whether Diana
urged it from motives of her own or out of concern for Richard it would
be difficult to say with certainty

The very thought of going to him for aid after all that had passed was
repugnant to Ruth And yet what choice had she Convinced by her cousin
and urged by her affection and duty to Richard she repressed her
aversion and calling for a horse rode out to Zoyland Chase attended
by a groom Wilding by good fortune was at home hard at work upon a
mass of documents in that same library where she had talked with him on
the occasion of her first visit to his hometo the home of which she
remembered that she was now herself the mistress He was preparing
for circulation in the West a mass of libels and incendiary pamphlets
calculated to forward the cause of the Protestant Duke

Dissembling his surprise he bade old Walterswho left her waiting in
the hall whilst he went to announce herto admit her instantly and he
advanced to the door to receive and welcome her

Ruth said he and his face was oddly alight you have come at last

She smiled a wan smile of selfpity I have been constrained said
she and told him what had happened that her brother had been arrested
for high treason and that the constable in searching the house had come
upon the Monmouth letter she had locked away in her desk

And not a doubt she ended but it will be believed that it was to
Richard the letter was indited by the Duke You will remember that
its only address was to my good friend W and that will stand for
Westmacott as well as Wilding

Mr Wilding was fain to laugh at the irony of this surprising turn of
things of which she brought him news for he had neither knowledge nor
suspicion of the machinations of his friend Trenchard to which these
events were due But noting and respecting her anxiety for her brother
he curbed his natural amusement

It is a judgment upon you said he nevertheless

Do you exult she asked indignantly

No but I cannot repress my admiration for the ways of Divine Justice
If you are come to me for advice I can but suggest that you should
follow your brothers captors to Taunton and inform the lieutenants of
how the letter came into your power

She looked at him in anger almost at what seemed a callousness Would
he believe me think you

Belike he would not said Mr Wilding You can but try

If I told them it was addressed to you she said eyeing him sternly
does it not occur to you that they would send for you to question you
and that if they did so as you are a gentleman you could not lie away
my brothers life

Why yes said he quite calmly it does occur to me But does it not
occur to you that by the time they came here they would find me gone
He laughed at her dismay I thank you madam for this warning he
added I think Ill bid them saddle for me without delay Too long
already have I tarried

And must Richard hang she asked him fiercely

Mr Wilding produced a snuffbox of tortoise shell and gold He opened it
deliberately If he does youll admit that he will hang on the gallows
that he has built himselfalthough intended for another Ifaith Hes
not the first booby to be caught in his own springe There is in this a
measure of poetic justice Poetry and justice Do you know Ruth
they are two things I have ever loved And he took a pinch of choice
Bergamot

Will you be serious she demanded

Trenchard would tell you that it were to make an exception from the
rule of my life he assured her smiling Yet even that might I do at
your bidding

But this is a serious matter she told him angrily

For Richard he acknowledged closing his snuffbox with a snap Tell
me what would you have me do

Since he asked her thus she answered him in two words Save him

At the cost of my own neck quoth he The price is high he reminded
her Do you think that Richard is quite worth it

And are you to save yourself at the cost of his she
counterquestioned Are you capable of such a baseness

He looked at her thoughtfully a moment You have not reflected said
he slowly that in this affair is involved more than mine or Richards
life There is a great cause weighing in the balance against all
personal considerations If I accounted Richard of more value to
Monmouth than I am myself I should not hesitate in riding to set
him free by taking his place As it is however I think I am of the
greatest conceivable importance to His Grace whilst if twenty Richards
perishedfranklytheir loss would be something of a gain for Richard
has played a traitors part already That is with me the first of all
considerations

Am I of no consideration to you she asked him And in an agony of
terror for her brother she now approached him and obeying a sudden
impulse cast herself upon her knees before him Listen she cried

Not thus said he a frown between his eyes He took her by the elbows
and gently but very firmly brought her to her feet again It is not
fitting you should kneel save at your prayers

She was standing now and very close to him his hands still held her
elbows though their touch was so light that she scarce felt it
To release them was easy and the next second her hands were on his
shoulders her brave eyes raised to him

Mr Wilding she implored him youll not let Richard be destroyed

He looked down at her with kindling glance his arms slipped round her
lissom waist It is hard to deny you Ruth said he Yet not my love
of my own life compels me but my duty my loyalty to the cause to which
I am pledged I were a traitor were I now to place myself in peril

She pressed against him her face so close to his that her breath fanned
his cheek whither a faint colour crept in quick response Despite
herself almost instinctively unconsciously she exerted the weapons of
her sex to bend him to her will

You say you love me she whispered Prove it me now and I will
believe you

Ah he sighed And believing me What then

He had himself grimly in hand yet feared he should not prove strong
enough to hold himself for long

You you shall find me your dutiful wife she faltered
crimsoning

His arms tightened about her he crushed her to him he bent his head to
hers and his lips burnt the lips she yielded to him as though they had
been living fire

Anon she was to weep in shamein shame and in astonishmentat that
instant of surrender but for the moment she had no thought save for her
brother Exultation filled her She accounted that she had conquered
and she gloried in the power her beauty gave her a power that had
sufficed to melt to water the hardfrozen purposes of this selfwilled
man The next instant however she was cold again with dismay and
newborn terror He unclasped her arms he drew back shaking off the
hands she had rested upon his shoulders His white facethe flush had
faded from it againsmiled a thought disdainfully

You bargain with me he said But I have some knowledge of your ways
of trading They are overshrewd for an honest gentleman

You mean she gasped her hand pressed to her heart her face a
deathly white you mean that youll not save him

I mean said he that I will have no further bargains with you

There was such hard finality in his tone that she recoiled beaten and
without power to return to the assault She had played and lost She
had yielded her lips to his kisses andhusband though he might be in
nameshame was her only guerdon

One look she gave him from out of that face so white and pitiful then
with a shudder turned from him and fled his presence He sprang after
her as the door closed then checked and stood in thought very grim for
one who professed to bestow no seriousness on the affairs of life Then
he returned slowly to his writingtable and rummaged there among the
papers with which it was encumbered seeking something of which he now
had need Through the open window he heard the retreating beat of her
horses hoofs He sighed and sat down heavily to take his long square
chin in his hand and stare before him at the sunlight on the lawn
outside

And whilst he sat thus Ruth made all haste back to Lupton House to tell
of the failure that had attended her There was nothing left her now
but to embark upon the forlorn hope of following Richard to Taunton to
offer her evidence of how the incriminating letter had come to be locked
in the drawer in which the constable had discovered it Diana met her
with a face as white as her own and infinitely more startled She had
just learnt that Sir Rowland Blake had been arrested also and that
he had been carried to Taunton together with Richard and as a
consequence she was as eager now that Ruth should repair to Albemarle
as she had erstwhile been earnest in urging her to seek out Mr Wilding
indeed Diana went so far as to offer to accompany her an offer that
Ruth gladly gratefully accepted

Within an hour Ruth and Dianain spite of all that poor docile Lady
Horton had said to stay themwere riding to Taunton attended by the
same groom who had so lately accompanied his mistress to Zoyland Chase






CHAPTER X THEIR OWN PETARD

In a lofty spacious room of the town hall at Taunton sat Sir Edward
Phelips and Colonel Luttrell to dispense justice and with them flanked
by one of them on either side of him sat Christopher Monk Duke of
Albemarle LordLieutenant of Devonshire who had been summoned in
all haste from Exeter that he might be present at an examination which
promised to be of so vast importance The three sat at a long table at
the rooms end attended by two secretaries

Before them guarded by constable and tythingmen weaponless their
hands pinioned behind themBlakes arm was healed by nowstood Mr
Westmacott and his friend Sir Rowland to answer this grave charge

Richard not knowing who might have betrayed him and to what extent was
very fearfulhaving through his connection with the Cause every reason
so to be Blake on the other hand conscious of his innocence of any
plotting was impatient of his position and a thought contemptuous
It was he who upon being ushered by the constable and his men into the
august presence of the LordLieutenant clamoured to know precisely of
what he was accused that he might straightway clear himself

Albemarle reared his great massive head smothered in a mighty black
peruke and scowled upon the florid London beau A blackvisaged
gentleman was Christopher Monk His pendulous cheeks it is true were
of a sallow pallor but what with his black wig black eyebrows dark
eyes and the blueblack tint of shaven beard on his great jaw and upper
lip he presented an appearance sombrely sinister His netherlip was
thick and very prominent deep creases ran from the corners of his mouth
adown his heavy chin his eyes were dull and lacklustre with great
pouches under them In the main the air of this son of the great
Parliamentarian general was stupid dull unprepossessing

The creases of his mouth deepened as Blake protested against what he
termed this outrage that had been done him he sneered ponderously
thrusting further forward his heavily undershot jowl

We are informed sir of your antecedents he staggered Blake by
answering We have learnt the reason why you left London and your
creditors and in all my life sir I have never known a man more ready
to turn his hand to treason than a broken gamester Your kind turns by
instinct to such work as this as a last resource for the mending of
battered fortunes

Blake crimsoned from chin to brow Im forejudged it seems he made
answer haughtily tossing his fair locks his blue eyes glaring upon his
judges May I at least know the name of my accuser

You shall receive impartial justice at our hands put in Phelips
whose manner was of a dangerous mildness Depend on that Not only
shall you know the name of your accuser but you shall be confronted by
him Meanwhile sirsand his glance strayed from Blakes flushed and
angry countenance to Richards pale and timidmeanwhile are we to
understand that you deny the charge

I have heard none as yet said Sir Rowland insolently

Albemarle turned to one of the secretaries Read them the indictment
said he and sank back in his chair his dull glance upon the prisoners
whilst the clerk in a droning voice read from a document which he took
up It impeached Sir Rowland Blake and Mr Richard Westmacott of holding
treasonable communication with James Scott Duke of Monmouth and of
plotting against His Majestys life and throne and the peace of His
Majestys realms

Blake listened with unconcealed impatience to the farrago of legal
phrases and snorted contemptuously when the reading came to an end

Albemarle looked at him darkly I do thank God said he that through
Mr Westmacotts folly has this hideous plot this black and damnable
treason been brought to light in time to enable us to stamp out this
fire ere it is well kindled Have you aught to say sir

I have to say that the whole charge a foul and unfounded lie said Sir
Rowland bluntly I never plotted in my life against anything but my own
prosperity nor against any man but myself

Albemarle smiled coldly at his colleagues then turned to Westmacott
And you sir he said Are you as stubborn as your friend

I incontinently deny the charge said Richard and he contrived that
his voice should ring bold and resolute

A charge built on air sneered Blake which the first breath of truth
should utterly dispel We have heard the impeachment Will Your Grace
with the same consideration permit us to see the proofs that we may lay
bare their falseness It should not be difficult

Do you say there is no such plot as is here alleged quoth the Duke
and smote a paper sharply

Blake shrugged his shoulders How should I know he asked I say I
have no share in any that I am acquainted with none

Call Mr Trenchard said the Duke quietly and an usher who had stood
tamely by the door at the far end of the room departed on the errand

Richard started at the mention of that name He had a singular dread of
Mr Trenchard

Colonel Luttrelllean and wirynow addressed the prisoners Blake more
particularly Still said he you will admit that such a plot may
indeed exist

It may indeed for aught I knowor care he added incautiously

Albemarle smote the table with a heavy hand By God he cried in that
deep booming voice of his there spoke a traitor You do not care you
say what plots may be hatched against His Majestys life and crown Yet
you ask me to believe you a true and loyal subject

Blake was angered he was at best a shorttempered man Deliberately he
floundered further into the mire

I have not asked Your Grace to believe me anything he answered hotly
It is all one to me what Your Grace believes me I take it I have not
been fetched hither to be confronted with what Your Grace believes You
have preferred a lying charge against me I ask for proofs not Your
Graces beliefs and opinions

By God sir you are a daring rogue cried Albemarle

Sir Rowlands eyes blazed Anon Your Grace when having failed of
your proofs you shall be constrained to restore me to liberty I shall
ask Your Grace to unsay that word

Albemarle stared confounded and in that moment the door opened and
Trenchard sauntered in cane in hand his hat under his arm a wicked
smile on his wizened face

Leaving Blakes veiled threat unanswered the Duke turned to the old
rake These rogues said he pointing to the prisoners demand proofs
ere they will admit the truth of the impeachment

Those proofs said Trenchard are already in Your Graces hands

Aye but they have asked to be confronted with their accuser

Trenchard bowed Is it your wish then that I recite for them the
counts on which I have based the accusation I laid before Your Grace

If you will condescend so far said Albemarle

Blister me roared Blake when the Duke interrupted him

By God sir he cried Ill have no such disrespectful language here
Youll observe the decency of speech and forbear from profanities you
damned rogue or by God Ill commit you forthwith

I will endeavour said Blake with a sarcasm lost on Albemarle to
follow Your Graces lofty example

You will do well sir said the Duke and was shocked that Trenchard
should laugh at such a moment

I was about to protest sir said Blake that it is monstrous
I should be accused by Mr Trenchard He has but the slightest
acquaintance with me

Trenchard bowed to him across the chamber Admitted sir said
he What should I be doing in bad company An answer this that set
Albemarle bawling with laughter Trenchard turned to the Duke I will
begin an it please Your Grace with the expressions used last night in
my presence at the Bell Inn at Bridgwater by Mr Richard Westmacott and
I will confine myself strictly to those matters on which my testimony
can be corroborated by that of other witnesses

Colonel Luttrell interrupted him to turn to Richard Do you recall
those expressions sir he asked him

Richard winced under the question Nevertheless he braced himself to
make the best defence he could I have not yet heard said he what
those expressions were nor when I hear them must it follow that I
recognize them as my own I must admit to having taken more wine
perhaps than than Whilst he sought the expression that he needed
Trenchard cut in with a laugh In vino veritas gentlemen and
His Grace and Sir Edward nodded sagely Luttrell preserved a stolid
exterior He seemed less prone than his colleagues to forejudging

Will you repeat the expressions used by Mr Westmacott Sir Edward
begged

I will repeat the one that to my mind matters most Mr Westmacott
getting to his feet and in a loud voice exclaimed God save the
Protestant Duke

Do you admit it sir thundered Albemarle his eyes glowering upon
Richard hesitated a moment pale and trembling

You will waste breath in denying it said Trenchard suavely for I
have a drawer from the Bell Inn and two gentlemen who overheard you
waiting outside

Ifaith sir cried Blake what treason was therein that If he

Silence thundered Albemarle Let Mr Westmacott speak for himself

Richard inspired by the defence Blake had begun took the same line of
argument I admit that in the heat of wine I may have used such words
said he But I deny their intent to be treasonable There are many men
who drink to the prosperity of the late Kingss son

Natural son sir natural son Albemarle amended It is treason to
speak of him otherwise

It will be a treason presently to draw breath sneered Blake

If it be said Trenchard it is a treason youll not be long
committing

Faith you are right Mr Trenchard said the Duke with a laugh
Indeed he found Mr Trenchard a most pleasant and facetious gentleman

Still insisted Richard endeavouring in spite of these irrelevancies
to make good his point there be many men who drink daily to the
prosperity of the late Kings natural son

Aye sir answered Albemarle but not his prosperity in horrid plots
against the life of our beloved sovereign

True Your Grace very true purred Sir Edward It was not so I meant
to toast him cried Richard Albemarle made an impatient gesture
and took up a sheet of paper How then he asked comes this
letterthis letter which makes plain the treason upon which the Duke
of Monmouth is embarked just as it makes plain your participation in
ithow comes this letter to be found in your possession And he waved
the letter in the air

Richard went the colour of ashes He faltered a moment then took refuge
in the truth for all that he knew beforehand that the truth was bound
to ring more false than any lie he could invent

That letter was not addressed to me he stammered

Albemarle read the subscription To my good friend W at Bridgwater
He looked up a heavy sneer thrusting his heavy lip still further out
What do you say to that Does not W stand for Westmacott

It does not

Of course not said Albemarle with heavy sarcasm It stands for
Wilkins or Williams or or Whatnot

Indeed I can bear witness that it does not exclaimed Sir Rowland

Be silent sir I tell you bawled the Duke at him again You shall
bear witness soon enough I promise you To whom then he resumed
turning again to Richard do you say that this letter was addressed

To Mr WildingMr Anthony Wilding Richard answered

I would have Your Grace to observe put in Trench ard quietly that
Mr Wilding properly speaking does not reside in Bridgwater

Tush cried Albemarle the rogue but mentions the first name with a
W that occurs to him Hes not even an ingenious liar And how sir
he asked Richard does it come to be in your possession having been
addressed as you say to Mr Wilding

Aye sir said Sir Edward blinking his weak eyes Tell us that

Richard hesitated again and looked at Blake Blake who by now had
come to realize that his friends affairs were not mended by his
interruptions moodily shrugged his shoulders scowling

Come sir said Colonel Luttrell engagingly answer the question

Aye roared Albemarle let your invention have free rein

Again poor Richard sought refuge in the truth WeSir Rowland here and
Ihad reason to suspect that he was awaiting such a letter

Tell us your reasons sir if we are to credit you said the Duke and
it was plain he mocked the prisoner It was moreover a request that
staggered Richard Still he sought to find a reason that should sound
plausible

We inferred it from certain remarks that Mr Wilding let fall in our
presence

Tell us the remarks sir the Duke insisted

Indeed I do not call his precise words to mind Your Grace But they
were such that we suspicioned him

And you would have me believe that hearing words which awoke in you
such grave suspicions you kept your suspicions and straightway forgot
the words Youre but an indifferent liar

Trenchard who was standing by the long table leaned forward now

It might be well an it please Your Grace said he to waive the
point and let us come to those matters which are of greater moment Let
him tell Your Grace how he came by the letter

Aye said Albemarle We do but waste time Tell us then how came
the letter into your hands

With Sir Rowland here I robbed the courier as he was riding from
Taunton to Bridgwater

Albemarle laughed and Sir Edward smiled You robbed him eh said His
Grace Very well But how did it happen that you knew he had the letter
upon him or was it that you were playing the hightobymen and that in
robbing him you hoped to find other matters

Not so sir answered Richard I sought but the letter

And how knew you that he carried it Did you learn that too from Mr
Wildings indiscretion

Your Grace has said it

Slife What an impudent rogue have we here cried the angry Duke
who conceived that Richard was purposely dealing in effrontery Mr
Trenchard I do think we are wasting time Be so good as to confound
them both with the truth of this matter

That letter said Trenchard was delivered to them at the Hare and
Hounds here at Taunton by a gentleman who put up at the inn and was
there joined by Mr Westmacott and Sir Rowland Blake They opened
the conversation with certain cant phrases very clearly intended as
passwords Thus the prisoners said to the messenger as they seated
themselves at the table he occupied You have the air sir of being
from overseas to which the courier answered Indeed yes I am from
Holland From the land of Orange says one of the prisoners Aye and
other things replies the messenger There is a fair wind blowing he
adds to which one of the prisoners I believe it was Sir Rowland makes
answer Mayit prosper the Protestant Duke and blow Popery to hell
Thereupon the landlord caught some mention of a letter but these
plotters perceiving that they were perhaps being overheard sent him
away to fetch them wine A halfhour later the messenger took his leave
and the prisoners followed a very few minutes afterwards

Albemarle turned to the prisoners You have heard Mr Trenchards
story How do you sayis it true or untrue

You will waste breath in denying it Trenchard took it again upon
himself to admonish them For I have with me the landlord of the Hare
and Hounds who will corroborate upon oath what I have said

We do not deny it put in Blake But we submit that the matter is
susceptible to explanation

You can keep your explanations till your trial then snapped
Albemarle I have heard more than enough to commit the pair of you to
gaol

But Your Grace cried Sir Rowland so fiercely that one of the
tythingmen set a restraining hand upon his shoulder I am ready to
swear that what I did and what my friend Mr Westmacott did was done
in the interests of His Majesty We were working to discover this plot

Which no doubt put in Trenchard slyly is the reason why having
got the letter your friend Mr Westmacott locked it in a desk and you
kept silence on the matter

You see exclaimed Albemarle how your lies do but serve further to
bind you in the toils It is ever thus with traitors

I do think you are a damned traitor Trenchard began Blake a
foul

But what more he would have said was checked by Albemarle who thundered
forth an order for their removal and then scarce were the words
uttered than the door at the far end of the hall was opened and through
it came a sound of womens voices Richard started for one was the
voice of Ruth

An usher advanced May it please Your Grace there are two ladies here
beg that you will hear their evidence in the matter of Mr Westmacott
and Sir Rowland Blake

Albemarle considered a moment Trenchard stood very thoughtful

Indeed said the Duke at last I have heard as much as I need hear
and Sir Phelips nodded in token of concurrence

Not so however Colonel Luttrell Still said he in the interests
of His Majesty perhaps we should be doing well to receive them

Albemarle blew out his cheeks like a man wearied and stared an instant
at Luttrell Then he shrugged his shoulders

Admit them then he commanded almost peevishly and Ruth and Diana
were ushered into the hall Both were pale but whilst Diana was
fluttered with excitement Ruth was calm and cool and it was she who
spoke in answer to the Dukes invitation The burden of her speech was
a clear succinct recitationin which she spared neither Wilding
nor herselfof how the letter came to have remained in her hands and
silence to have been preserved regarding it Albemarle heard her very
patiently

If what you say is true mistress said he and God forbid that
I should be so ungallant as to throw doubt upon a ladys word it
certainly explainsalthough most strangelyhow the letter was not
brought to us at once by your brother and his friend Sir Rowland You
are prepared to swear that this letter was intended for Mr Wilding

I am prepared to swear it she replied

This is very serious said the Duke

Very serious assented Sir Edward Phelips

Albemarle a little flustered turned to his colleagues What do you
say to this Were it perhaps well to order Mr Wildings apprehension
and to have him brought hither

It were to give yourselves useless trouble gentlemen said Trenchard
with so much assurance that it was plain Albemarle hesitated

Beware of Mr Trenchard Your Grace cried Ruth He is Mr Wildings
friend and if there is a plot he is sure to be in it

Albemarle startled looked at Trenchard Had the accusation come from
either of the men the Duke would have silenced him and abused him
but coming from a woman and so comely a woman it seemed to His Grace
worthy at least of consideration But nimble Mr Trenchard was easily
master of the situation

Which of course he answered with fine sarcasm is the reason why
I have been at work for the past fourandtwenty hours to lay proofs of
this plot before Your Grace

Albemarle was ashamed of his momentary hesitation

For the rest said Trenchard it is perfectly true that I am Mr
Wildings friend But the lady is even more intimately connected with
him It happens that she is his wife

His his wife gasped the Duke whilst Phelips chuckled and Colonel
Luttrells face grew dark

Trenchards wicked smile flickered upon his mobile features There are
rumours current of court paid her by Sir Rowland there Who knows he
questioned most suggestively arching his brows and tightening his lips
Wives are strange kittlekattle and husbands have been known before to
grow inconvenient Upon reflection Your Grace will no doubt discern the
precise degree of faith to attach to what this lady may tell you against
Mr Wilding

Oh exclaimed Ruth her cheeks flaming crimson But this is
monstrous

Tis how I should myself describe it answered Trenchard without shame

Spurred to it thus Ruth poured out the entire story of her marriage
and so clear and lucid was her statement that it threw upon the affair a
flood of light whilst so frank and truthful was her tone her narrative
hung so well together that the Bench began to recover from the shock to
its faith and was again in danger of believing her Trenchard saw this
and trembled To save Wilding for the Cause he had resorted to this
desperate expedient of betraying that Cause It must be observed
however that he had not done so save under the conviction that betrayed
it was bound to be and that since that was inevitable the thing had
better come from himfor Wildings sakethan from Richard Westmacott
He had taken the bull by the horns in a most desperate fashion when he
had determined to hoist Richard and Blake with their own petard hoping
that after all the harm would reach no further than the destruction of
these twoa purely defensive measure But now this girl threatened
to wreck his scheme just as it was being safely steered to harbour
Suddenly he swung round interrupting her

Lies lies lies he clamoured and his interruption coming at such a
time served to impress the Duke most unfavourablyas well it might

It is our wish to hear this lady out Mr Trenchard the Duke reproved
him

But Mr Trenchard was undismayed Indeed he had just discovered a
hitherto neglected card which should put an end to this dangerous game

I do abhor to hear Your Graces patience thus abused he exclaimed
with some show of heat This lady makes a mock of you If youll allow
me to ask two questionsor perhaps threeIll promise finally to prick
this bubble for you Have I Your Graces leave

Well well said Albemarle Let us hear your questions And his
colleagues nodded

Trenchard turned airily to Ruth Behind her Diana satan attendant had
fetched a chair for herin fear and wonder at what she saw and heard
her eyes ever and anon straying to Sir Rowlands back which was towards
her

This letter madam said he for the possession of which you have
accounted in so so picturesque a manner was intended for and
addressed to Mr Wilding you say And you are prepared to swear to it

Ruth turned indignantly to the Bench Must I answer this mans
questions she demanded

I think perhaps it were best you did said the Duke still showing
her all deference

She turned to Trenchard her head high her eyes full upon his wrinkled
cynical face I swear then she began but heconsummate actor
that he was and versed in tricks that impress an audienceinterrupted
her raising one of his gnarled yellow hands

Nay nay said he I would not have perjury proved against you I do
not ask you to swear It will be sufficient if you pronounce yourself
prepared to swear

She pouted her lip a trifle her whole expression manifesting her
contempt of him I am in no fear of perjuring myself she answered
fearlessly And I swear that the letter in question was addressed to
Mr Wilding

As you will said Trenchard and was careful not to ask her how she
came by her knowledge The letter no doubt was in an outer wrapper
on which there would be a superscriptionthe name of the person to whom
the letter was addressed he half questioned and Luttrell who saw the
drift of the question nodded gravely

No doubt said Ruth

Now you will acknowledge I am sure madam that such a wrapper would
be a document of the greatest importance as important indeed as the
letter itself since we could depend upon it finally to clear up this
point on which we differ You will admit so much I think

Why yes she answered but her voice faltered a little and her
glance was not quite so fearless She too saw at last the pit he had
dug for her He leaned forward smiling quietly his voice impressively
subdued and launched the bolt that was to annihilate the credibility of
the story she had told

Can you then explain how it comes that that wrapper has been
suppressed Can you tell us howthe matter being as you state itin
very selfdefence against the dangers of keeping such a letter your
brother did not also keep that wrapper

Her eyes fell away from his face they turned to Albemarle who sat
scowling again and from him they flickered unsteadily to Phelips and
Luttrell and lastly to Richard who very white and with set teeth
stood listening to the working of his ruin

I I do not know she faltered at last

Ah said Trenchard drawing a deep breath He turned to the Bench
Need I suggest what was the needthe urgent needfor suppressing that
wrapper quoth he Need I say what name was inscribed upon it I think
not Your Graces keen insight and yours gentlemen will determine
what was probable

Sir Rowland now stood forward addressing Albemarle Will Your Grace
permit me to offer my explanation of this

Albemarle banged the table His patience was at an end since he came
now to believeas Trenchard had earlier suggestedthat he had been
played upon by Ruth

Too many explanations have I heard already sir he answered He
turned to one of his secretaries In his sudden excess of choler he
forgot his colleagues altogether The prisoners are committed for
trial said he harshly and Trenchard breathed freely at last But the
next instant he caught his breath again for a ringing voice was heard
without demanding to see His Grace of Albemarle at once and the voice
was the voice of Anthony Wilding






CHAPTER XI THE MARPLOT

Mr Wildings appearance produced as many different emotions as there
were individuals present He made the company a sweeping bow on his
admission by Albemarles orders a bow which was returned by a stare
from one and all Diana eyed him in amazement Ruth in hope Richard
averted his glance from that of his brotherinlaw whilst Sir Rowland
met it with a scowl of enmitythey had not come face to face since the
occasion of that encounter in which Sir Rowlands selflove had been so
rudely handled Albemarles face expressed a sort of satisfaction
which was reflected on the countenances of Phelips and Luttrell whilst
Trenchard never thought of attempting to dissemble his profound dismay
And this dismay was shared though not in so deep a measure by Wilding
himself Trenchards presence gave him pause for he had been far
indeed from dreaming that his friend had a hand in this affair At
sight of him all was made clear to Mr Wilding At once he saw the role
which Trenchard had assumed on this occasion saw to the bottom of the
motives that had inspired him to take the bull by the horns and level
against Richard and Blake this accusation before they had leisure to
level it against himself

His quick wits having fathomed Trenchards motive Mr Wilding was
deeply touched by this proof of friendship and for a second as deeply
nonplussed at loss now how to discharge the task on which he came

You are very choicely come Mr Wilding said Albemarle You will be
able to resolve me certain doubts which have been set on foot by these
traitors

That said Mr Wilding is the purpose for which I am here News
reached me of the arrest that had been made May I beg that Your Grace
will place me in possession of the facts that have so far transpired

It was one of his secretaries who at Albemarles bidding gave Wilding
the information that he craved He listened gravely then before
Albemarle had time to question him on the score of the name that might
have been upon the enfolding wrapper of the letter he begged that he
might confer apart a moment with Mr Trenchard

But Mr Wilding said Colonel Luttrell surprised not to hear the
immediate denial of the imputation they had expected we should first
like to hear

By your leave sirs Wilding interrupted I should prefer that
you ask me nothing until I have consulted with Mr Trenchard He saw
Luttrells frown observed Sir Edward shift his wig to scratch his head
in sheer perplexity and caught the foreshadowing of denial on the
Dukes face So without giving any of them time to say him nay he
added quickly and very seriously I am begging this in the interests of
justice Your Grace has told me that some lingering doubt still haunts
your mind upon the subject of this letterthe other charges can matter
little apart from that treasonable document It lies within my power to
resolve such doubts most clearly and finally But I warn you sirs that
not one word will I utter in this connection until I have had speech
with Mr Trenchard

There was about his mien and voice a firmness that forewarned Albemarle
that to insist would be worse than idle A slight pause followed his
words and Luttrell leaned across to whisper in His Graces ear from
the Dukes other side Sir Edward bent his head forward till it almost
touched those of his companions Blake watched and was most foolishly
impatient

Your Grace will never allow this he cried

Eh said Albemarle scowling at him

If you allow those two villains to consort together we are all undone
the baronet protested and ruined what chance there was of Albemarles
not consenting

It was the one thing needed to determine Albemarle Like the stubborn
man he was there was naught he detested so much as to have his course
dictated to him More than that in Sir Rowlands anxiety that Wilding
and Trenchard should not be allowed to confer apart he smoked a fear
on Sir Rowlands part based upon the baronets consciousness of his own
guilt He turned from him with a sneering smile and without so much
as consulting his associates he glanced at Wilding and waved his hand
towards the door

Pray do as you suggest Mr Wilding said he But I depend upon you
not to tax our patience

I shall not keep Mr Trenchard a moment longer than is necessary said
Wilding giving no hint of the second meaning in his words

He stepped to the door opened it himself and signed to Trenchard to
pass out The old player obeyed him readily if in silence An usher
closed the door after them and in silence they walked together to the
end of the passage

Where is your horse Nick quoth Wilding abruptly

What a plague do you mean where is my horse flashed Trenchard What
midsummer frenzy is this Damn you for a marplot Anthony What a pox
are you thinking of to thrust yourself in here at such a time

I had no knowledge you were in the affair said Wilding You should
have told me His manner was brisk to the point of dryness However
there is still time to get you out of it Where is your horse

Damn my horse answered Trenchard in a passion You have spoiled
everything

On the contrary said Mr Wilding tartly it seems you had done that
very thoroughly before I arrived Whilst I am touched by the regard for
me which has misled you into turning the tables on Blake and Westmacott
yet I do blame you for this betrayal of the Cause

There was no help for it

Why no and that is why you should have left matters where they
stood

Trenchard stamped his foot indeed he almost danced in the excess of
his vexation Left them where they stood he echoed Body o me
Where are your wits Left them where they stood And at any moment you
might have been taken unawares as a consequence of this accusation being
lodged against you by Richard or by Blake Then the Cause would have
been betrayed indeed

Not more so than it is now

Not less at least snapped the player You give me credit for no
more wit than yourself Do you think that I am the man to do things by
halves I have betrayed the plot to Albemarle but do you imagine I have
made no provision for what must follow

Provision echoed Wilding staring

Aye provision God lack What do you suppose Albemarle will do

Dispatch a messenger to Whitehall with the letter within an hour

You perceive it do you And where the plague do you think Nick
Trenchardll be what time that messenger rides

Mr Wilding understood Aye you may stare sneered Trenchard A
letter that has once been stolen may be stolen again The courier must
go by way of Walford I had in my mind arranged the spot close by the
ford where I should fall upon him rob him of his dispatches and take
himbound hand and foot if necessaryto Vallanceys who lives close
by and there Id leave him until word came that the Duke had landed

That the Duke had landed cried Wilding You talk as though the thing
were imminent

And imminent it is For aught we know he may be in England already

Mr Wilding laughed impatiently You must forever be building on these
crackbrained rumours Nick said he

Rumours roared the other Rumours Ha He checked his wild scorn
and proceeded in a different key I was forgetting You do not know the
Contents of that stolen letter

Wilding started Underlying his disbelief in the talk of the
countryside and even in the military measures which by the Kings
orders were being taken in the West was an uneasy dread lest they
should prove to be well founded lest Argyles operations in Scotland
should be but the forerunner of a rash and premature invasion by
Monmouth He knew the Duke was surrounded by such reckless foolhardy
counsellors as Grey and Fergusonand yet he could not think the Duke
would ruin all by coming before he had definite word that his friends
were ready He looked at Trenchard now with anxious eyes

Have you seen the letter Nick he asked and almost dreaded the
reply

Albemarle showed it me an hour ago said Trenchard

And it contains

The news we fear It is in the Dukes own hand and intimates that he
will follow it in a few daysin a few days man in person

Mr Wilding clenched teeth and hands God help us all then he
muttered grimly

Meanwhile quoth Trenchard bringing him back to the point there is
this precious business here I had as choice a plan as could have been
devised and it must have succeeded had you not come blundering into it
to mar it all at the last moment That fat fool Albemarle had swallowed
my impeachment like a draught of muscadine Do you hear me he ended
sharply for Mr Wilding stood bemused his thoughts plainly wandering

He let his hand fall upon Trenchards shoulder No said he I wasnt
listening No matter for even had I known the full extent of your
scheme I still must have interfered

For the sake of Mistress Westmacotts blue eyes no doubt sneered
Trenchard Pah Wherever theres a woman theres the loss of a man

For the sake of Mistress Wildings blue eyes his friend corrected
him Ill allow no brother of hers to hang in my place

It will be interesting to see how you will rescue him

By telling the truth to Albemarle

Hell not believe it

I shall prove it said Wilding quietly Trenchard swung round upon him
in mingled anger and alarm for him You shall not do it he snarled
It is nothing short of treason to the Duke to get yourself laid by the
heels at such a time as this

I hope to avoid it answered Wilding confidently

Avoid it How

Not by staying longer here in talk That will ruin all Away with you
Trenchard

By my soul no answered Trenchard Ill not leave you If I have got
you into this Ill help to get you out again or stay in it with you

Bethink you of Monmouth Wilding admonished him

Damn Monmouth was the vicious answer I am here and here I stay

Get to horse you fool and ride to Walford as you proposed there to
ambush the messenger The letter will go to Whitehall none the less in
spite of what I shall tell Albemarle If things go well with me I shall
join you at Vallanceys before long

Why if that is your intention said Trenchard I had better stay
and we can ride together It will make it less uncertain for you

But less certain for you

The more reason why I should remain

The door of the hall was suddenly flung open at the far end of the
corridor and Albemarles booming voice impatiently raised reached
them where they stood

In any case added Trenchard it seems there is no help for it now

Mr Wilding shrugged his shoulders but otherwise dissembled his
vexation Up the passage floated the constables voice calling them

Side by side they moved down and side by side they stepped once more
into the presence of Christopher Monk and his associates

Sirs you have not been in haste was the Dukes illhumoured
greeting

We have tarried a little that we might make an end the sooner
answered Trenchard dryly and this was the first indication he gave Mr
Wilding of how naturallylike the inimitable actor that he washe had
slipped into his new role

Albemarle waved the frivolous rejoinder aside Come Mr Wilding said
he let us hear what you may have to say You are not I take it about
to urge any reasons why these rogues should not be committed

Indeed Your Grace said Wilding that is what I am about to urge

Blake and Richard looked at him suddenly and from him to Trenchard but
it was only Ruth whose eyes were shrewd enough to observe the altered
demeanour of the latter Her hopes rose founded upon this oddly
assorted pair Already in anticipation she was stirred by gratitude
towards Wilding and it was in impatient and almost wondering awe that
she waited for him to proceed

I take it sir he said without waiting for Albemarle to express
any of the fresh astonishment his countenance manifested that the
accusation against these gentlemen rests entirely upon the letter which
you have been led to believe was addressed to Mr Westmacott

The Duke scowled a moment before replying Why said he if it could
be shownirrefutably shownthat the letter was not addressed to either
of them that would no doubt establish the truth of what they saythat
they possessed themselves of the letter in the interests of His
Majesty He turned to Luttrell and Phelips and they nodded their
concurrence with his view of the matter But he continued if
you are proposing to prove any such thing I think you will find it
difficult

Mr Wilding drew a crumpled paper from his pocket When the courier
whom they robbed as they have correctly informed you said he quietly
suspected their design upon the contents of his wallet he bethought
him of removing the wrapper from the letter so that in case the
letter were seized by them it should prove nothing against any man
in particular He stuffed the wrapper into the lining of his hat
preserving it as a proof of his good faith against the time when he
should bring the letter to its destination or come to confess that it
had been taken from him That wrapper the courier brought to me and I
have it here The evidence it will give should be more than sufficient
to warrant your restoring these unjustly accused gentlemen their
liberty

The courier took it to you echoed Albemarle stupefaction in his
glance But why to you

Because said Wilding and with his left hand he placed the wrapper
before Albemarle whilst his right dropped again to his pocket the
letter as you may see was addressed to me

The quiet manner in which he made the announcement conveyed almost as
great a shock as the announcement itself

Albemarle took up the wrapper Luttrell and Phelips craned forward to
join him in his scrutiny of it They compared the two paper with paper
writing with writing Then Monk flung one and the other down in front of
him

What lies have I been hearing then he demanded furiously of
Trenchard Slife Ill make an example of you Arrest me that
roguearrest them both and he half rose from his seat his trembling
hand pointing to Wilding and Trenchard

Two of the tythingmen stirred to do his bidding but in the same
instant Albemarle found himself looking into the round nozzle of a
pistol

If said Mr Wilding a finger is laid upon Mr Trenchard or me I
shall have the extreme mortification of being compelled to shoot Your
Grace

His pleasantly modulated voice was as deliberate and calm as if he were
offering the Bench a pinch of snuff Albemarles dark visage crimsoned
his eyes became at once wicked and afraid Sir Edwards cheeks turned
pale his glance grew startled Luttrell alone vigilant and dangerous
preserved his calm But the situation baffled even him

Behind the two friends the tythingmen had come to a terrorstricken
halt Diana had risen from her chair in the excitement of the moment and
had drawn close to Ruth who looked on with parted lips and bosom
that rose and fell Even Blake could not stifle his admiration of
Mr Wildings coolness and address Richard on the other hand was
concerned only with thoughts for himself wondering how it would fare
with him if Wilding and Trenchard succeeded in getting away

Nick said Mr Wilding will you desire those catchpolls behind us
to stand aside If Your Grace raises your voice to call for help if
indeed any measures are taken calculated to lead to our capture I
can promise Your Gracenotwithstanding my profound reluctance to use
violencethat they will be the last measures you will take in life Be
good enough to open the door Nick and to see that the key is on the
outside

Trenchard who was by way of enjoying himself now stepped briskly
down the hall to do as his friend bade him with a wary eye on the
tythingmen But never so much as a finger did they dare to lift Mr
Wildings calm was too deadly they had seen a man in earnest before
this and they knew his appearance now From the doorway Trenchard
called Mr Wilding

I must be going Your Grace said the latter very courteously but
I shall not be so wanting in deference to His Majestys august
representatives as to turn my back upon you Saying which he walked
backwards holding his pistol level until he had reached Trenchard and
the door There he paused and made them a deep bow his manner the more
mocking in that there was no tinge of mockery perceptible Your very
obedient servant said he and stepped outside Trenchard turned the
key withdrew it from the lock and standing on tiptoe thrust it upon
the ledge of the lintel

Instantly a clamour arose within the chamber But the two friends never
stayed to listen Down the passage they sped at the double and out
into the courtyard Here Ruths groom mounted himself was walking his
mistresss and Dianas horses up and down whilst he waited yonder one
of Sir Edwards stableboys was holding Mr Wildings roan Two or three
men of the Somerset militia in their red and yellow liveries lounged
by the gates and turned uninterested eyes upon these newcomers

Wilding approached his wifes groom Get down he said I need your
horseon the Kings business Get down I say he added impatiently
upon noting the fellows stare and seizing his leg he helped him to
dismount by almost dragging him from the saddle Up with you Nick
said he and Nick very promptly mounted Your mistress will be here
presently Wilding told the groom and turning on his heel strode
to his own mare A moment later Trenchard and he vanished through the
gateway with a tremendous clatter just as the LordLieutenant Colonel
Luttrell Sir Edward Phelips the constable the tythingmen Sir
Rowland Richard and the ladies made their appearance

Ruth pushed her way quickly to the front She feared lest her horse
and her cousins being at hand might be used for the pursuit so urging
Diana to do the same she snatched her reins from the hands of the
dumbfounded groom and leapt nimbly to the saddle

After them roared Albemarle and the constable with two of his
men made a dash for the gateway to raise the hue and cry whilst
the militiamen watched them in stupid inactive wonder Damnation
mistress thundered the Duke in everincreasing passion hold your
nag Hold your nag woman For Ruths horse had become unmanageable
and was caracoling about the yard between the men and the gateway in
such a manner that they dared not attempt to win past her

You have scared him with your bellowing she panted tugging at the
bridle and all but backed into the constable who had been endeavouring
to get round behind her The beast continued its wild prancing and the
Duke abated nothing in his furious profanity until suddenly the groom
having relinquished to Diana the reins of the other horse sprang to
Ruths assistance and caught her bridle in a firm grasp which brought
the animal to a standstill

You fool she hissed at him and half raised her whip to strike but
checked on the impulse bethinking her in time that after all what the
poor lad had done he had done thinking her distressed

The constable and a couple of his fellows won through others were
rousing the stable and getting to horse and in the courtyard all was
bustle and commotion Meanwhile however Mr Wilding and Trenchard had
made the most of their start and were thundering through the town






CHAPTER XII AT THE FORD

As Mr Wilding and Nick Trenchard rode helltoleather through Taunton
streets they never noticed a horseman at the door of the Red Lion Inn
But the horseman noticed them He looked up at the sound of their wild
approach started upon recognizing them and turned in his saddle as
they swept past him to call upon them excitedly to stop

Hi he shouted Nick Trenchard Hi Wilding Then seeing that they
either did not hear or did not heed him he loosed a volley of oaths
wheeled his horse about drove home the spurs and started in pursuit
Out of the town he followed them and along the road towards Walford
shouting and clamouring at first afterwards in a grim and angry
silence

Now despite their natural anxiety for their own safety Wilding and
Trenchard had by no means abandoned their project of taking cover by the
ford to await the messenger whom Albemarle and the others would no
doubt be sending to Whitehall and this mad fellow thundering after them
seemed in a fair way to mar their plan As they reluctantly passed the
spot they had marked out for their ambush splashed through the ford and
breasted the rising ground beyond they took counsel They determined
to stand and meet this rash pursuer Trenchard calmly opined that if
necessary they must shoot him he was I fear a bloodyminded fellow
at bottom although it is true he justified himself now by pointing out
that this was no time to hesitate at trifles Partly because they
talked and partly because the gradient was steep and their horses
needed breathing they slackened rein and the horseman behind them
came tearing through the water of the ford and lessened the distance
considerably in the next few minutes

He bethought him of using his lungs once more Hi Wilding Hold damn
you

He curses you in a most intimate manner quoth Trenchard

Wilding reined in and turned in the saddle His voice has a familiar
sound said he He shaded his eyes with his hand and looked down the
slope at the pursuer who came on crouching low upon the withers of his
goaded beast

Wait the fellow shouted I have newsnews for you

Its Vallancey cried Wilding suddenly Trenchard too had drawn
rein and was looking behind him Instead of expressing relief at the
discovery that this was not an enemy he swore at the trouble to
which they had so needlessly put themselves and he was still at his
vituperations when Vallancey came up with them red in the face and very
angry cursing them roundly for the folly of their mad career and for
not having stopped when he bade them

It was no doubt discourteous said Mr Wilding but we took you for
some friend of the LordLieutenants

Are they after you quoth Vallancey his face of a sudden very
startled

Like enough said Trenchard if they have found their horses yet

Forward then Vallancey urged them in excitement and he picked up
his reins again You shall hear my news as we ride

Not so said Trenchard We have business here down yonder at the
ford

Business What business

They told him and scarce had they got the words out than he cut in
impatiently Thats no matter now

Not yet perhaps said Mr Wilding but it will be if that letter
gets to Whitehall

Odso was the impatient retort theres other news travelling to
Whitehall that will make smallbeer of thisand belike its well on its
way there already

What news is that asked Trenchard Vallancey told them The Duke has
landedhe came ashore this morning at Lyme

The Duke quoth Mr Wilding whilst Trenchard merely stared What
Duke

What Duke Lord you weary me What dukes be there The Duke of
Monmouth man

Monmouth They uttered the name in a breath But is this really
true asked Wilding Or is it but another rumour

Remember the letter your friends intercepted Trenchard bade him

I am not forgetting it said Wilding

Its no rumour Vallancey assured them I was at White Lackington
three hours ago when the news came to George Speke and I was riding to
carry it to you going by way of Taunton that I might drop word of it
for our friends at the Red Lion

Trenchard needed no further convincing he looked accordingly dismayed
But Wilding found it still almost impossiblein spite of what already
he had learntto credit this amazing news It was hard to believe the
Duke of Monmouth mad enough to spoil all by this sudden and unheralded
precipitation

You heard the news at White Lackington said he slowly Who carried
it thither

There were two messengers answered Vallancey with restrained
impatience and they were Heywood Darewho has been appointed
paymaster to the Dukes forcesand Mr Chamberlain

Mr Wilding was observed for once to change colour He gripped Vallancey
by the wrist You saw them he demanded and his voice had a husky
unusual sound You saw them

With these two eyes answered Vallancey and I spoke with them

It was true then There was no room for further doubt

Wilding looked at Trenchard who shrugged his shoulders and made a wry
face I never thought but that we were working in the service of a
hairbrain said he contemptuously

Vallancey proceeded to details Dare and Chamberlain he informed
them came off the Dukes own frigate at daybreak today They were put
ashore at Seatown and they rode straight to Mr Spekes with the news
returning afterwards to Lyme

What men has the Duke with him did you learn asked Wilding

Not more than a hundred or so from what Dare told us

A hundred God help us all And is England to be conquered with a
hundred men Oh this is midsummer frenzy

He counts on all true Protestants to flock to his banner put in
Trenchard and it was not plain whether he expressed a fact or sneered
at one

Does he bring money and arms at least asked Wilding

I did not ask answered Vallancey But Dare told us that three
vessels had come over so that it is to be supposed he brings some
manner of provision with him

It is to be hoped so Vallancey but hardly to be supposed quoth
Trenchard and then he touched Wilding on the arm and pointed with his
whip across the fields towards Taunton A cloud of dust was rising from
between tall hedges where ran the road I think it were wise to be
moving At least this sudden landing of James Scott relieves my mind in
the matter of that letter

Wilding having taken a look at the floating dust that announced the
oncoming of their pursuers was now lost in thought Vallancey who
beyond excitement at the news of which he was the bearer seemed to have
no opinion of his own as to the wisdom or folly of the Dukes sudden
arrival looked from one to the other of these two men whom he had known
as the prime secret agents in the West and waited Trenchard moved his
horse a few paces nearer the hedge Whither now Anthony he asked
suddenly

You may ask indeed exclaimed Wilding and his voice was as bitter
as ever Trenchard had heard it S heart We are in it now We had
best make for Lymeif only that we may attempt to persuade this
crackbrained boy to ship back to Holland again and ship ourselves with
him

Theres sense in you at last grumbled Trenchard But I misdoubt me
hell turn back after having come so far Have you any money he asked
He could be very practical at times

A guinea or two But I can get money at Ilminster

And how do you propose to reach Ilminster with these gentlemen by way
of cutting us off

Well double back as far as the crossroads said Wilding promptly
and strike south over Swell Hill for Hatch If we ride hard we can do
it easily and have little fear of being followed Theyll naturally
take it we have made for Bridgwater

They acted on the suggestion there and then Vallancey going with them
for his task was now accomplished and he was all eager to get to Lyme
to kiss the hand of the Protestant Duke They rode hard as Wilding had
said they must and they reached the junction of the roads before their
pursuers hove in sight Here Wilding suddenly detained them again The
road ahead of them ran straight for almost a mile so that if they took
it now they were almost sure to be seen presently by the messengers
On their right a thickly grown coppice stretched from the road to the
stream that babbled in the hollow He gave it as his advice that they
should lie hidden there until those who hunted them should have gone by
Obviously that was the only plan and his companions instantly adopted
it They found a way through a gate into an adjacent field and from
this they gained the shelter of the trees Trenchard neglectful of
his finery and oblivious of the ubiquitous brambles left his horse in
Vallanceys care and crept to the edge of the thicket that he might take
a peep at the pursuers

They came up very soon six militiamen in lobster coats with yellow
facings and a sergeant which was what Mr Trenchard might have
expected There was however something else that Mr Trenchard did not
expect something that afforded him considerable surprise At the head
of the party rode Sir Rowland Blakeobviously leading itand with him
was Richard Westmacott Amongst them went a man in grey clothes
whom Mr Trenchard rightly conjectured to be the messenger riding for
Whitehall He thought with a smile of what a handful he and
Wilding would have had had they waited to rob that messenger of the
incriminating letter that he bore Then he checked his smile to consider
again how Sir Rowland Blake came to head that party He abandoned the
problem as the little troop swept unhesitatingly round to the left and
went pounding along the road that led northwards to Bridgwater clearly
never doubting which way their quarry had sped

As for Sir Rowland Blakes connection with this pursuit the town
gallant had by his earnestness not only convinced Colonel Luttrell of
his loyalty and devotion to King James but had actually gone so far as
to beg that he might be allowed to prove that same loyalty by leading
the soldiers to the capture of those selfconfessed traitors Mr
Wilding and Mr Trenchard From his knowledge of their haunts he was
confident he assured Colonel Luttrell that he could be of service
to the King in this matter The fierce sincerity of his purpose shone
through his words Luttrell caught the accent of hate in Sir Rowlands
tense voice and being a shrewd man he saw that if Mr Wilding was to
be taken an enemy would surely be the best pursuer to accomplish it So
he prevailed and gave him the trust he sought in spite of Albemarles
expressed reluctance And never did bloodhound set out more relentlessly
purposeful upon a scent than did Sir Rowland follow now in what he
believed to be the track of this man who stood between him and Ruth
Westmacott Until Ruth was widowed Sir Rowlands hopes of her must lie
fallow and so it was with a zest that he flung himself into the task of
widowing her

As the party passed out of view round the angle of the white road
Trenchard made his way back to Wilding to tell him what he had seen and
to lay before him for his enucleation the problem of Blakes being the
leader of it But Wilding thought little of Blake and cared little of
what he might be the leader

Well stay here said he until they have passed the crest of the
hill

This Trenchard told him was his own purpose for to leave their
concealment earlier would be to reveal themselves to any of the troopers
who might happen to glance over his shoulder

And so they waited some ten minutes or so and then walked their horses
slowly and carefully forward through the trees towards the road Wilding
was alongside and slightly ahead of Trenchard Vallancey followed close
upon their tails Suddenly as Wilding was about to put his mare at the
low stone wall Trenchard leaned forward and caught his bridle

Ss he hissed Horses

And now that they halted they heard the hoofbeats clear and close at
hand the crackling of undergrowth and the rustle of the leaves through
which they had thrust their passage had deafened their ears to other
sounds until this moment They checked and waited where they stood
barely screened by the few boughs that still might intervene between
them and the open not daring to advance and not daring to retreat
lest their movements should draw attention to themselves They remained
absolutely still scarcely breathing their only hope being that if
these who came should chance to be enemies they might ride on without
looking to right or left It was so slender a hope that Wilding looked
to the priming of his pistols whilst Trenchard who had none loosened
his sword in its scabbard Nearer came the riders

There are not more than three whispered Trenchard who had been
listening intently and Mr Wilding nodded but said nothing

Another moment and the little party was abreast of those watchers a
dark brown ridinghabit flashed into their line of vision and a
blue one laced with gold At sight of the first Mr Wildings eyelids
flickered he had recognized it for Ruths with whom rode Diana
whilst some twenty paces or so behind came Jerry the groom They were
returning to Bridgwater

They came along looking neither to right nor to left as the three men
had hoped they would and they were all but past when suddenly Wilding
gave his roan a touch of the spur and bounded forward Dianas horse
swerved so that it nearly threw her Ruth slightly ahead reined in at
once so too did the groom in the rear and so violently in his sudden
fear of highwaymen that he brought his horse on to its hind legs and had
it prancing and rearing madly about the road so that he was hard put to
it to keep his seat

Ruth looked round as Mr Wildings voice greeted her

Mistress Wilding he called to her A moment if I may detain you

You have eluded them she cried entirely off her guard in her
surprise at seeing him and there echoed through her words a note of
genuine gladness that almost disconcerted her husband for a moment The
next instant a crimson flush overspread her pale face and her eyes were
veiled from him vexation in her heart at having betrayed the lively
satisfaction it afforded her to see him safe when she feared him
captured already or at least upon the point of capture

She had admired him almost unconsciously for his daring at the town hall
that day when his strong calm had stood out in such sharp contrast to
the fluster and excitement of the men about him of them all indeed it
had seemed to her in those stressful moments that he was the only man
and she wasalthough she did not realize itin danger of being proud
of him Then again the thing he had done He had come deliberately to
thrust his head into the lions maw that he might save her brother It
was possible that he had done it in answer to the entreaties which she
had earlier feared she had poured into deaf ears or it was possible
that he had done it spurred by his sense of right and justice which
would not permit him to allow another to suffer in his steadhowever
much that other might be caught in the very toils that he had prepared
for Mr Wilding himself Her admiration then was swelled by gratitude
and it was a compound of these that had urged her to hinder the
tythingmen from winning past her until he and Trenchard should have got
well away

Afterwards when with Diana and her groomon a horse which Sir Edward
Phelips insisted upon lending themshe rode homeward from Taunton
there was Diana to keep alive the spark of kindness that glowed at last
for Wilding in Ruths breast Miss Horton extolled his bravery his
chivalry his nobility and ended by expressing her envy of Ruth that
she should have won such a man amongst men for her husband and wondered
what it might be that kept Ruth from claiming him for her own as was
her right Ruth had answered little but she had ridden very thoughtful
there was that in the past she found it hard to forgive Wilding And yet
she would now have welcomed an opportunity of thanking him for what he
had done of expressing to him something of the respect he had won
in her eyes by his act of selfdenunciation to save her brother This
chance it seemed was given her for there he stood with head bared
before her and already she thought no longer of seizing the chance
vexed as she was at having been surprised into a betrayal of feelings
whose warmth she had until that moment scarce estimated

In answer to her cry of You have eluded them he waved a hand towards
the rising ground and the road to Bridgwater

They passed that way but a few moments since said he and by the
rate at which they were travelling they should be nearing Newton by now
In their great haste to catch me they could not pause to look for me so
close at hand he added with a smile and for that I am thankful

She sat her horse and answered nothing which threw her cousin out of
all patience with her Come Jerry Diana called to the groom We
will walk our horses up the hill

You are very good madam said Mr Wilding and he bowed to the
withers of his roan

Ruth said nothing expressed neither approval nor disapproval of Dianas
withdrawal and the latter with a word of greeting to Wilding went
ahead followed by Jerry who had regained control by now of the beast
he bestrode Wilding watched them until they turned the corner then he
walked his mare slowly forward until he was alongside Ruth

Before I go said he there is something I should like to say His
dark eyes were sombre his manner betrayed some hesitation

The diffidence of his tone proved startling to her by virtue of its
unusualness What might it portend she wondered and sought with grave
eyes to read his baffling countenance and then a wild alarm swept into
her and shook her spirit in its grip there was something of which until
this moment she had not thoughtsomething connected with the fateful
matter of that letter It had stood as a barrier between them her
buckler her sole defence against him It had been to her what its
sting is to the beea thing which if once used in selfdefence is
selfdestructive Not indeed that she had used it as her sting it had
been forced from her by the machinations of Trenchard but used it had
been and was done with she had it no longer that with it she might
hold him in defiance and it did not occur to her that he was no longer
in case to invoke the law

Her face grew stony a dry glitter came to her blue eyes she cast a
glance over her shoulder at Diana and her servant Wilding observed
it and read what was passing in her mind indeed it was not to be
mistaken no more than what is passing in the mind of the recruit who
looks behind him in the act of charging His lips half smiled

Of what are you afraid he asked her

I am not afraid she answered in husky accents that belied her

Perhaps to reassure her perhaps because he thought of his companions
lurking in the thicket and cared not to have them for his audience he
suggested they should go a little way in the direction her cousin had
taken She wheeled her horse and side by side they ambled up the
dusty road

The thing I have to tell you said he presently concerns myself

Does it concern me she asked him coldly and her coolness was urged
partly by her newborn fears partly to counterbalance such impression
as her illjudged show of gladness at his safety might have made upon his
mind He flashed her a sidelong glance the long white fingers of his
right hand toying thoughtfully with a ringlet of the dark brown hair
that fell upon the shoulders of his scarlet coat

Surely madam he answered dryly what concerns a man may well
concern his wife

She bowed her head her eyes upon the road before her True said she
her voice expressionless I had forgot

He reined in and turned to look at her her horse moved on a pace or
two then came to a halt apparently of its own accord

I do protest said he you treat me less kindly than I deserve He
urged his mare forward until he had come up with her again and
then drew rein once more I think that I may lay some claim toat
leastyour gratitude for what I did today

It is my inclination to be grateful said she She was very wary of
him Forgive me if I am still mistrustful

But of what he cried a thought impatiently

Of you What ends did you seek to serve Was it to save Richard that
you came

Unless you think that it was to save Blake he said ironically What
other ends do you conceive I could have served She made him no answer
and so he resumed after a pause I rode to Taunton to serve you for two
reasons because you asked me and because I would have no innocent men
suffer in my steadnot even though as these men they were but caught
in their own toils hoist with the petard they had charged for me
Beyond these two motives I had no other thought in ruining myself

Ruining yourself she cried Yes it was true but she had not thought
of it until this moment there had been so much to think of

Is it not ruin to be outlawed to have a price set upon your head as
will no doubt a price be set on mine when Albemarles messenger shall
have reached Whitehall Is it not ruin to have my lands and all I
own made forfeit to the State to find myself a beggar hunted and
proscribed Forgive me that I harass you with this catalogue of my
misfortunes Youll say no doubt that I have brought them upon myself
by compelling you against your will to marry me

Ill not deny that it is in my mind said she and of set purpose
stifled pity

He sighed and looked at her again but she would not meet his eye else
its whimsical expression might have intrigued her Can you deny my
magnanimity I wonder said he and spoke almost as one amused All I
had I sacrificed to do your will to save your brother from the snare
of his own contriving against me I wonder do you yet realize how much
I sacrificed today at Taunton I wonder And he paused looking at her
and waiting for some word from her but she had none for him

Clearly you do not else I think you would show me if only a pretence
of kindness She was looking at him at last her eyes less hard They
seemed to ask him to explain When you came this morning with the
tale of how the tables had been turned upon your brother of how he
was caught in his own springe and the letter found in his keeping was
before the Kings folk at Taunton with every appearance of having been
addressed to him and not a tittle of evidence to show that it had been
meant for me do you know what news it was you brought me He paused
a second looking at her from narrowing eyes Then he answered his own
question You brought me the news that you were mine to take whensoeer
I pleased Whilst that letter was in your hands it gave you the power to
make me your obedient slave You might blow upon me as you listed whilst
you held it and I was a vane that must turn to your blowing for my
honours sake and for the sake of the cause in which I worked Through
no rashness of mine must that letter come into the hands of the Kings
friends else was I dishonoured It was an effective barrier between us
So long as you possessed that letter you might pipe as you pleased and
I must dance to the tune you set And then this morning what you came to
tell me was that things were changed that it was mine to call the tune
Had I had the strength to be a villain you had been mine now and
your brother and Sir Rowland might have hanged on the rope of their own
weaving

She looked at him in a startled almost shamefaced manner This was an
aspect of the case she had not considered

You realize it I see he said and smiled wistfully Then perhaps
you realize why you found me so unwilling to do the thing you craved
Having treated me ungenerously you came to cast yourself upon my
generosity asking methough I scarcely think you understoodto beggar
myself of life itself with all it held for me God knows I make no
pretence to virtue and yet I think I had been something more than human
had I not refused you and the bargain you offereda bargain that you
would never be called upon to fulfil if I did the thing you asked

At last she interrupted him she could bear it no longer

I had not thought of it she cried It was a piteous wail that broke
from her I swear I had not thought of that I was all distraught for
poor Richards sake Oh Mr Wilding she turned to him holding out a
hand her eyes shone filmed with moisture I shall have a kindness
for you all my days for your generosity today It was lamentably
weak far from the hot expressions which she forced it to replace

Yes I was generous he admitted We will move on as far as the
crossroads Again they ambled gently forward Up the slope from the
ford Diana and Jerry were slowly climbing not another human being was
in sight ahead or behind them After you left me he continued your
memory and your entreaties lingered with me I gave the matter of our
position thought and it seemed to me that all was monstrously illdone
I loved you Ruth I needed you and you disdained me My love was
master of me But neath your disdain it was transmuted oddly He
checked the passion that was vibrating in his voice and resumed after
a pause in the calm slow tones soft and musical that were his own
There is scarce the need for so much recapitulation When the power
was mine I bent you unfairly to my will you did as much by me when
the power suddenly became yours It was a strange war between us and I
accepted its conditions Today when the power was mine again mine
to bring you at last to subjection behold I have capitulated at
your bidding and all that I heldincluding your own selfhave I
relinquished It is perhaps fitting Haply I am punished for having wed
you before I had wooed you Again his tone changed it grew more cold
more matteroffact I rode this way a little while ago a hunted man
my only hope to reach home and collect what moneys and valuables I could
carry and make for the coast to find a vessel bound for Holland I
have been engaged as you know in stirring up rebellion to check the
iniquities and persecutions that are toward in a land I love Ill not
weary you with details Time was needed for this as for all things and
by next spring perhaps had matters gone well this vineyard that so
carefully and secretly I have been tending would have been maybe in
condition to bear fruit Even now in the hour of my flight I learn
that others have come to force this delicate growth into sudden
maturity There Soon ripe soon rotten The Duke of Monmouth has landed
at Lyme this morning I am riding to him

To what end she cried and he saw in her face a dismay that amounted
almost to fear and he wondered was it for him

To place my sword at his service Were I not encompassed by this
ruin I should not have stirred a foot in that directionso rash so
foredoomed to failure is this invasion As it ishe shrugged and
laughedit is the only hopeall forlorn though it may befor me

The trammels she had imposed upon her soul fell away at that like bonds
of cobweb She laid her hand upon his wrists tears stood in her eyes
her lips quivered

Anthony forgive me she besought him He trembled under her touch
under the caress of her voice and at the sound of his name for the
first time upon her lips

What have I to forgive he asked

The thing that I did in the matter of that letter

You poor child said he smiling gently upon her you did it in
selfdefence

Yet say that you forgive mesay it before you go she begged him

He considered her gravely a moment To what end he asked do you
imagine that I have talked so much To the end that I might show you
that however I may have wronged you I have at the last made some amends
and that for the sake of this the truest proof of penitence I may have
your forgiveness ere I go

She was weeping softly It was an ill day on which we met she sighed

For youaye

Nayfor you

Well say for both of us then he compromised See Ruth your
cousin grows weary and I have a couple of comrades who are no doubt
impatient to be gone It may not be good for us to tarry in these parts
Some amends I have made but there is one crowning wrong which I have
done you for which there is but one amend to make He paused He
steadied himself before continuing In his attempt to render his voice
cold and commonplace he went near to achieving harshness It may be
that this crackbrained rebellion of which the torch is already alight
will if it does no other good in England at least make a widow of you
When that has come to pass when I have thus repaired the wrong I
did you I hope youll bear me as kindly as may be in your thought
Goodbye my Ruth I would you might have loved me I sought to force
it He smiled ever so wanly Perhaps that was my mistake It is an
ill thing to eat ones hay while it is grass He raised to his lips the
little gloved hand that still rested on his wrist God keep you Ruth
he murmured

She sought to answer him but something choked her a sob was all she
achieved Had he caught her to him in that moment there is little doubt
but that she had yielded Perhaps he knew it and knowing it kept the
tighter rein upon desire She was as metal molten in the crucible to be
moulded by his craftsmans hands into any pattern that he chose But the
crucible was the crucible of pity not of love that too he knew and
knowing it forbore

He dropped her hand doffed his hat and wheeling his horse about
touched it with the spur and rode back towards the thicket where his
friends awaited him As he left her she too wheeled about as if to
follow him She strove to command her voice that she might recall him
but at that same moment Trenchard hearing his returning hoofs thrust
out into the road with Vallancey following at his heels The old
players harsh voice reached her where she stood and it was querulous
with impatience

What a plague do you mean dallying here at such a time Anthony he
cried to which Vallancey added In Gods name let us push on

At that she checked her impulseit may even be that she mistrusted it
She paused lingering undecided for an instant then turning her horse
once more she ambled up the slope to rejoin Diana






CHAPTER XIII PRO RELIGIONE ET LIBERTATE

The evening was far advanced when Mr Wilding and his two companions
descended to Uplyme Common from the heights whence as they rode they had
commanded a clear view of the fair valley of the Axe lying now under a
thin opalescent veil of evening mist

They had paused at Ilminster for fresh horses and there Wilding had
paid a visit to one of his agents from whom he had procured a hundred
guineas Thence they had come south at a sharp pace and with little
said Wilding was moody and thoughtful filled with chagrin at this
unconscionable rashness of the man upon whom all his hopes were centred
As they cantered briskly across Uplyme Common in the twilight they
passed several bodies of countrymen all heading for the town and one
group sent up a shout of God save the Protestant Duke as they rode
past him

Amen to that muttered Mr Wilding grimly for I am afraid that no
man can

In the narrow lane by Hay Farm a horseman going in the opposite
direction passed them at the gallop but they had met several such
since leaving Ilminster for indeed the news was spreading fast and the
whole countryside was alive with messengers some on foot and some on
horseback but all hurrying as if their lives depended on their haste

They made their way to the MarketPlace where Monmouths
declarationthat remarkable manifesto from the pen of Fergusonhad
been read some hours before Thence having ascertained where His Grace
was lodged they made their way to the George Inn

In Coombe Street they found the crowd so dense that they could but with
difficulty open out a way for their horses through the human press
Not a window but was open and thronged with sightseersmostly women
indeed for the men were in the press below On every hand resounded the
cries of A Monmouth A Monmouth The Protestant Religion Religion and
Liberty which latter were the words inscribed on the standard Monmouth
had set up that evening on the Church Cliffs

In truth Wilding was amazed at what he saw and said as much to
Trenchard So pessimistic had been his outlook that he had almost
expected to find the rebellion snuffed out by the time they reached
LymeoftheKing What had the authorities been about that they had
permitted Monmouth to come ashore or had Vallanceys information been
wrong in the matter of the numbers that accompanied the Protestant
Champion Wildings red coat attracted some attention In the dusk its
colour was almost all that could be discerned of it

Heres a militia captain for the Duke cried one and others took up
the cry and if it did nothing else it opened a way for them through
that solid human mass and permitted them to win through to the yard of
the George Inn They found the spacious quadrangle thronged with men
armed and unarmed and on the steps stood a tall wellknit soldierly
man his hat rakishly cocked about whom a crowd of townsmen and
country fellows were pressing with insistence At a glance Mr Wilding
recognized Captain Vennerraised to the rank of colonel by Monmouth on
the way from Holland

Trenchard dismounted and taking a distracted stableboy by the arm
bade him see to their horses The fellow endeavoured to swing himself
free of the others tenacious grasp

Let me go he cried I am for the Duke

And so are we my fine rebel answered Trenchard holding fast

Let me go the lout insisted I am going to enlist

And so you shall when you have stabled our nags See to him Vallancey
he is brainsick with the fumes of war

The fellow protested but Trenchards way was brisk and short and so
protesting still he led away their cattle in the end Vallancey going
with him to see that he performed this last duty as a stableboy ere he
too became a champion militant of the Protestant Cause Trenchard sped
after Wilding who was elbowing his way through the yokels about the
steps The glare of a newly lighted lamp from the doorway fell full upon
his long white face as he advanced and Venner espied and recognized
him

Mr Wilding he cried and there was a glad ring in his voice
for though cobblers tailors deserters from the militia potboys
stableboys and shuffling yokels had been coming in in numbers during
the past few hours since the Declaration had been read this was the
first gentleman that arrived to welcome Monmouth The soldier stretched
out a hand to grasp the newcomers His Grace will see you this
instant not a doubt of it He turned and called down the passage
Cragg A young man in a buff coat came forward and to him Venner
delivered Wilding and Trenchard that he might announce them to His
Grace

In the room that had been set apart for him abovestairs Monmouth still
sat at table He had just supped with but an indifferent appetite
so fevered was he by the events of his landing He was excited with
hopeinspired by the readiness with which the men of Lyme and its
neighbourhood had flocked to his bannerand fretted by anxiety that
none of the gentry of the vicinity should yet have followed the example
of the meaner folk in answer to the messages dispatched at dawn from
Seaton The board at which he sat was still cumbered with some glasses
and platters and vestiges of his repast Below him on his right sat
Fergusonthat prince of plottersvery busy with pen and ink his keen
face almost hidden by his great periwig opposite were Lord Grey of
Werke and Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun whilst standing at the foot of
the table barely within the circle of candlelight from the branch on the
polished oak was Nathaniel Wade the lawyer who had fled to Holland
on account of his alleged complicity in the Rye House plot and was now
returned a major in the Dukes service Erect and soldierly of figure
girt with a great sword and with the butt of a pistol protruding from
his belt he had little the air of a man whose methods of contention
were forensic

You understand then Major Wade His Grace was saying his voice
pleasant and musical It is decided that the guns had best be got
ashore forthwith and mounted

Wade bowed I shall set about it at once Your Grace I shall not want
for help Have I Your Graces leave to go

Monmouth nodded and as Wade passed out Ensign Cragg entered to
announce Mr Wilding and Mr Trenchard The Duke rose to his feet his
glance suddenly brightening Fletcher and Grey rose with him Ferguson
paid no heed absorbed in his task which he industriously continued

At last exclaimed the Duke Admit them sir

When they entered Wilding coming first his hat under his arm the Duke
sprang to meet him a tall young figure lithe and slender as a blade of
steel and of a steely strength for all his slimness He was dressed in
a suit of purple that became him marvellously well and on his breast a
star of diamonds flashed and smouldered like a thing of fire He was
of an exceeding beauty of face wherein he mainly favoured that bold
handsome woman that was his mother without however any of his
mothers insipidity fine eyes a good nose straight and slender and
a mouth which if sensual and indicating a lack of strength was
beautifully shaped His chin was slightly cleft the shape of his face
a delicate oval framed now in the waving masses of his brown wig Some
likeness to his late Majesty was also discernible in spite of the wart
out of which his uncle James made so much capital

There was a slight flush on his cheeks an added lustre in his eye as
he took Wildings hand and shook it heartily before Wilding had time to
kiss His Graces

You are late he said but there was no reproach in his voice We had
looked to find you here when we came ashore You had my letter

I had not Your Grace answered Wilding very grave It was stolen

Stolen cried the Duke and behind him Grey pressed forward whilst
even Ferguson paused in his writing to raise his piercing eyes and
listen

It is no matter Wilding reassured him Although stolen it has but
gone to Whitehall today when it can add little to the news that is
already on its way there

The Duke laughed softly with a flash of white teeth and looked past
Wilding at Trenchard Some of the light faded out of his eyes They
told me Mr Trenchard he began when Wilding half turning to his
friend explained

This is Mr Nicholas TrenchardJohn Trenchards cousin

I bid you welcome sir said the Duke very agreeably and I trust
your cousin follows you

Alas said Trenchard my cousin is in France and in a few brief
words he related the matter of John Trenchards homecoming on his
acquittal and the trouble there had been connected with it

The Duke received the news in silence He had expected good support from
old Spekes soninlaw Indeed there was a promise that when he came
John Trenchard would bring fifteen hundred men from Taunton He took a
turn in the room deep in thought and there was a pause until Ferguson
rubbing his great Roman nose asked suddenly had Mr Wilding seen the
Declaration Mr Wilding had not and thereupon the plotting parson who
was proud of his composition would have read it to him there and then
but that Grey sourly told him the matter would keep and that they had
other things to discuss with Mr Wilding

This the Duke himself confirmed stating that there were matters on
which he would be glad to have their opinion

He invited the newcomers to draw chairs to the table glasses were
called for and a couple of fresh bottles of Canary went round the
board The talk was desultory for a few moments whilst Wilding and
Trenchard washed the dust from their throats then Monmouth broke the
ice by asking them bluntly what they thought of his coming thus earlier
than was at first agreed

Wilding never hesitated in his reply Frankly Your Grace said he I
like it not at all

Fletcher looked up sharply his clear intelligent eyes full upon
Wildings calm face his countenance expressing as little as did
Wildings Ferguson seemed slightly taken aback Greys thick lips were
twisted in a sneering smile

Faith said the latter with elaborate sarcasm in that case it only
remains for us to ship again heave anchor and back to Holland

It is what I should advise said Wilding slowly and quietly if I
thought there was a chance of my advice being taken He had a calm
almost apathetic way of uttering startling things which rendered them
doubly startling The sneer seemed to freeze on Lord Greys lips
Fletcher continued to stare but his eyes had grown more round Ferguson
scowled darkly The Dukes boyish faceit was still very youthful
despite his sixandthirty yearsexpressed a wondering consternation
He looked at Wilding and from Wilding to the others and his glance
seemed to entreat them to suggest an answer to him It was Grey at last
who took the matter up

You shall explain your meaning sir or we must hold you a traitor he
exclaimed

King James does that already answered Wilding with a quiet smile

Dye mean the Duke of York rumbled Fergusons Scottish accent with
startling suddenness and Monmouth nodded approval of the correction
If ye mean that bloody papist and fratricide it were well so to speak
of him Had ye read the Declaration

But Fletcher cropped his speech in midgrowth He was ever a
shorttempered man intolerant of irrelevancies

It were well perhaps said he his accent abundantly proclaiming him
a fellow countryman of Fergusons to keep to the matter before us Mr
Wilding no doubt will state the reasons that exist or that he fancies
may exist for giving advice which is hardly worthy of the cause to
which he stands committed

Aye Fletcher said Monmouth there is sense in you Tell us what is
in your mind Mr Wilding

It is in my mind Your Grace that this invasion is rash premature
and illadvised

Odds life cried Grey and he swung angrily round fully to face the
Duke the nostrils of his heavy nose dilating Are we to listen to this
milksop prattle

Nick Trenchard who had hitherto been silent cleared his throat so
noisily that he drew all eyes to himself

Your Grace Mr Wilding pursued his air calm and dignified and
gathering more dignity from the circumstance that he proceeded as if
there had been no interruption when I had the honour of conferring
with you at The Hague two months ago it was agreed that you should
spend the summer in Swedenaway from politics and scheming leaving
the work of preparation to your accredited agents here That work I have
been slowly but surely pushing forward It was not to be hurried men of
position are not to be won over in a day men with anything to lose need
some guarantee that they are not wantonly casting their possessions to
the winds By next spring as was agreed all would have been ready
Delay could not have hurt you Indeed with every day by which you
delayed your coming you did good service to your cause you strengthened
its prospects of success for every day the peoples burden of
oppression and persecution grows more heavy and the peoples temper
more short every day by the methods that he is pursuing King James
brings himself into deeper hatred This hatred is spreading It was
the business of myself and those others to help it on until from the
cottage of the ploughman the infection of anger should have spread
to the mansion of the squire Had Your Grace but given me time as
I entreated you and as you promised me you might have marched to
Whitehall with scarce the shedding of a drop of blood had Your Grace
but waited until we were ready England would have so trembled at your
landing that your uncles throne would have toppled over neath the
shock As it is He shrugged his shoulders sighed and spread his
hands leaving his sentence uncompleted

Monmouth sat sobered by these sober words the intoxication that had
come to him from the little measure of success that had attended the
opening of the listing on Church Cliffs deserted him now he saw the
thing stark and in its true proportions and not even the shouting of
the folk in the streets below crying his name and acclaiming him their
champion served to lighten the gloom that Wildings words cast like
a cloud over his volatile heart Alas poor Monmouth He was ever a
weathercock and even as Wildings words seemed to strike the courage
out of him so did Greys short contemptuous answer restore it

As it is well thrust that throne over with our hands said he after
a moments pause

Aye cried Monmouth Well do it God helping us

Our dependence and trust is in the Lord of Hosts in Whose Name we
go forth boomed the voice of Ferguson quoting from his precious
Declaration The Lord will do that which seemeth good unto Him

An unanswerable argument said Wilding smiling But the Lord I am
told by the gentlemen of your cloth works in His own good time and my
fears are all lest finding us unprepared of ourselves the Lords good
time be not yet

Out on ye sir cried Ferguson Ye want for reverence

Common sense will serve us better at the moment answered Wilding
with a touch of sharpness He turned to the frowning and perplexed
Dukewhose mind was being tossed this way and that like a shuttlecock
upon the battledore of these mens words Your Grace he said
forgive me that I speak it if hear it you will or forbid me to say it
if your resolve is unalterable in this matter

It is unalterable answered Grey for the Duke

But Monmouth gently overruled him for once

Nevertheless speak by all means Mr Wilding Whatever you may say
you need have no fear that any of us can doubt your good intentions to
ourselves

I thank Your Grace What I have to say is but a repetition of the
first words I uttered at this table I would urge Your Grace even now to
retreat

What Are you mad It was Lord Grey who asked the impatient question

I doubt its overlate for that said Fletcher slowly

I am not so sure answered Wilding But I am sure that to attempt it
were the safer coursethe surer in the end I myself may not linger
to push forward the task of stirring up the people for I am already
something more than under suspicion But there are others who will
remain to carry on the work after I have departed with Your Grace if
Your Grace thinks well From the Continent by correspondence we can
mature our plans In a twelvemonth things will be very different and we
can return with confidence

Grey shrugged and turned his shoulder upon Wilding but said no word
There was silence of some few moments Andrew Fletcher leaned his elbow
on the table and took his brow in his great bony hand Wildings words
seemed an echo of those he himself had spoken a week or two ago only to
be overruled by Grey who swayed the Duke more than did any otherand
that he did not do so of fell purpose and seeking deliberately to work
Monmouths ruin no man will ever be able to say with certainty

Ferguson rose a tall spare stooping figure and smote the board with
his fist It is a good cause he cried and God will not leave us
unless we leave Him

Henry the Seventh landed with fewer men than did Your Grace said
Grey and he succeeded

True put in Fletcher But Henry the Seventh was sure of the support
of not a few of the nobility which does not seem to be our case

Ferguson and Grey stared at him in horror Monmouth sat biting his lip
more bewildered than thoughtful

O man of little faith roared Ferguson in a passion Are ye to be
swayed like a straw in the wind

I am no swayed Ye ken this was ever my own view I feel in my heart
that what Mr Wilding says is right It is but what I said myself and
Captain Matthews with me before we embarked upon this expedition We
were in danger of ruining all by a needless precipitancy Nay man
never stare so he said to Grey I am in it now and I am no the man
to draw back nor do I go so far as Mr Wilding in counselling such a
course Weve set our hands to the plough let us go forward in Gods
name Yet I would remind you that what Mr Wilding says is true Had
we waited until next year we had found the usurpers throne tottering
under him and on our landing it would have toppled oer of itself

I have said already that well overset it with our hands Grey
answered

How many hands have you asked a new voice a crisp discordant voice
much steeped in mockery It was Nick Trenchards

Have we another here of Mr Wildings mind cried Grey staring at
him

I am seldom of any other answered Trenchard

We shall no want for hands Ferguson assured him Had ye arrived
earlier ye might have seen how readily men enlisted He had risen and
approached the window as he spoke he pulled it open to let in the full
volume of sound that rose from the street below

A Monmouth A Monmouth voices shouted

Ferguson struck a theatrical posture one long lean arm stretched
outward from the shoulder

Ye hear them sirs he cried and there was a gleam of triumph in his
eye That is answer enough to those who want for faith to the feckless
ones that think the Lord will abandon those that have set out to serve
Him and his glance comprehended Fletcher Trenchard and Wilding

The Duke stirred in his chair stretched a hand for the bottle and
filled a glass His mercurial spirits were rising again He smiled at
Wilding

I think you are answered sir said he and I hope that like Fletcher
there who shared your doubts you will come to agree that since we have
set our hands to the plough we must go forward

I have said that which I had it on my conscience to say Your Grace may
have found me overready with my counsel at least you shall find me no
less ready with my sword

Odso That is better Grey applauded and his manner was almost
pleasant

I never doubted it Mr Wilding His Grace replied but I should like
to hear you say that you are convincedat least in part and he
waved his hand towards the window It was almost as if he pleaded for
encouragement In common with most men who came in contact with Wilding
he had felt the latent force of this mans nature the strength that was
hidden under that calm surface and the acuteness of the judgment that
must be wedded to it He longed to have the word of such a man that his
enterprise was not as desperate as Wilding had seemed at first to paint
it But Wilding made no concession to hopes or desires when he dealt
with facts

Men will flock to you no doubt persecution has wearied many of the
countryfolk and they are ready for revolt But they are all untrained
in arms they are rustics not soldiers If any of the men of position
were to rally round your standard they would bring the militia and
others in their train they would bring arms horses and money all of
which Your Grace must be sorely needing

They will come answered the Duke

Some no doubt Wilding agreed but had it been next year I would
have answered for it that it would have been no handful had ridden in
to welcome you Scarce a gentleman of Devon or Somerset of Dorset or
Hampshire of Wiltshire or Cheshire but would have hastened to your
side

They will come as it is the Duke repeated with an almost womanish
insistence persisting in believing what he hoped all evidence apart

The door opened and Ensign Cragg made his appearance May it please
Your Grace he announced Mr Battiscomb has just arrived and asks
will Your Grace receive him tonight

Battiscomb cried the Duke Again his cheek flushed and his eye
sparkled Aye in Heavens name show him up

And may the Lord refresh us with good tidings prayed Ferguson
devoutly

Monmouth turned to Wilding It is the agent I sent ahead of me from
Holland to stir up the gentry from here to the Mersey

I know said Wilding we conferred together some weeks since

Now you shall see how idle are your fears the Duke promised him

And Wilding who was better informed on that score kept silence






CHAPTER XIV HIS GRACE IN COUNSEL

Mr Christopher Battiscomb that mildmannered Dorchester gentleman
who like Wade was by vocation a lawyer was ushered into the Dukes
presence He was dressed in black and like Ferguson was almost
smothered in a great periwig which he may have adopted for purposes of
disguise rather than adornment Certainly he had none of that air of
the soldier of fortune which distinguished his brother of the robe He
advanced hat in hand towards the table greeting the company about it
and Wilding observed that he wore silk stockings and shoes upon which
there rested not a speck of dust Mr Battiscomb was plainly a man who
loved his ease since on such a day he had travelled to Lyme in a coach
The lawyer bent low to kiss the Dukes hand and scarce was that formal
homage paid than questions poured upon him from Grey from Fletcher and
from Ferguson

Gentlemen gentlemen the Duke entreated them smiling and
remembering their manners they fell silent

As Wilding afterwards told Trenchard they reminded him of a parcel of
saucy lacqueys who take liberties with an upstart master for whom they
are wanting in respect

I am glad to see you Battiscomb said Monmouth when quiet was
restored and I trust I behold in you a bearer of good tidings

The lawyers full face was usually pale tonight it was in addition
solemn and the smile that haunted his lips was a courtesy smile that
expressed neither mirth nor satisfaction He cleared his throat as if
nervous He avoided the Dukes question as to the quality of the news
he brought by answering that he had made all haste to come to Lyme upon
hearing of His Graces landing He was surprised he said as well he
might be for the arrangement was that having done his work he was to
return to Holland and report to Monmouth upon the feeling of the gentry

But your news Battiscomb the Duke insisted Aye put in Grey in
Heavens name let us hear that

Again there was the little nervous cough from Battiscomb I have scarce
had time to complete my round of visits he temporized Your Grace
has taken us so by surprise I I was with Sir Walter Young at Colyton
when the news of your landing came some few hours ago His voice
faltered and seemed to die away

Well cried the Duke His brows were drawn together Already he
realized that Battiscombs tidings were not good else would he be
hesitating less in uttering them Is Sir Walter with you at least

I grieve to say that he is not

Not It was Grey who spoke and he followed the ejaculation by an
oath Why not

He is following no doubt suggested Fletcher

We may hope sirs answered Battiscomb that in a few dayswhen he
shall have seen the zeal of the countrysidehe will be cured of his
present lukewarmness Thus discreetly did the man of law break the
bad news he bore

Monmouth sank back into his chair like one who has lost some of
his strength Lukewarmness he repeated dully Sir Walter Young
lukewarm

Even so Your Gracealas and Battiscomb sighed audibly

Fergusons voice boomed forth again to startle them The ox knoweth his
owner he cried the ass his masters crib but Israel doth not know
my people doth not consider

Grey pushed the bottle contemptuously across the table to the parson
Drink man and get sense said he and turned aside to question
Battiscomb touching others of the neighbourhood upon whom they had
depended

What of Sir Francis Rolles he inquired

Battiscomb answered the question addressing himself to the Duke

Alas Sir Francis no doubt would have been faithful to Your Grace
but unfortunately Sir Francis is in prison already

Deeper grew Monmouths frown his fingers drummed the table absently
Fletcher poured himself wine his face inscrutable Grey threw one leg
over the other and in a voice that was carefully careless he inquired
And what of Sidney Clifford

He is considering said Battiscomb I was to have seen him again at
the end of the month meanwhile he would take no resolve

Lord Gervase Scoresby questioned Grey less carelessly

Battiscomb half turned to him then faced the Duke again as he made
answer Mr Wilding there can tell you more concerning Lord Gervase

All eyes swept round to Wilding who sat in silence listening
Monmouths were laden with inquiry and some anxiety Wilding shook his
head slowly sadly You must not depend upon him he answered Lord
Gervase was not yet ripe A little longer and I think I must have won
him for Your Grace

Heaven help us exclaimed the Duke in petulant vexation Is no one
coming in

Ferguson swung a hand towards the still open window drawing attention
to the sounds without

Does Your Grace not hear that ye can ask he cried almost
reproachfully but they scarce heeded him for Grey was inquiring if
Mr Strode might be depended upon to join and that was a matter that
claimed the greater attention

I think said Battiscomb that he might have been depended upon

Might have been questioned Fletcher speaking now for the first time
since Battiscombs arrival

Like Sir Francis Rolles he is in prison the lawyer explained

Monmouth leaned forward and his young face looked careworn now he
thrust a slender hand under the brown curls upon his brow Will you
tell us Mr Battiscomb upon what friends you think that we may count
he said

Battiscomb pursed his lips a second pondering I think said he
that you may count upon Mr Legge and Mr Hooper and possibly upon
Colonel Churchill though I cannot say what following they will bring
if any Mr Trenchard upon whom we counted for fifteen hundred men of
Taunton has been obliged to fly the country to escape arrest

We have heard that from Mr Trenchards cousin answered the Duke
What of Prideaux of Ford Is he lukewarm

I was unable to elicit a definite promise from him But he was
favourably disposed to Your Grace

His Grace made a gesture that seemed to dismiss Prideaux from their
calculations And Mr Hucker of Taunton

Battiscombs manner grew yet more ill at ease Mr Hucker himself I
am sure would place his sword at your disposal But his brother is a
redhot Tory

Well well sighed the Duke I take it we must not make certain of
Mr Hucker Are there any others besides Legge and Hooper upon whom you
think that we may reckon

Lord Wiltshire perhaps said Battiscomb but with a lack of
assurance

A plague on perhaps exclaimed Monmouth growing irritable I want
you to name the men of whom you are certain

Battiscomb stood silent for a moment pondering He looked almost
foolish like a schoolboy who hesitates to confess his ignorance of the
answer to a question set him

Fletcher swung round his grey eyes flashing angrily his accent more
Scottish than ever

Is it that yere certain o none Mr Battiscomb he exclaimed

Indeed said Battiscomb I think we may be fairly certain of Mr
Legge and Mr Hooper

And of none besides questioned Fletcher again Be these the only
representatives of the flower of Englands nobility that is to flock to
the banner of the cause of Englands freedom and religion Scorn was
stamped on every word of his question

Battiscomb spread his hands raised his brows and said nothing

The Lord knows I do not say it exulting said Fletcher but I told
Your Grace yours was hardly the case of Henry the Seventh as my Lord
Grey would have you believe

We shall see snapped Grey scowling at the Scot The people are
coming in hundredsaye in thousandsthe gentry will follow they
must

Make not too sure Your Graceoh make not too sure Wilding besought
the Duke As I have said these hinds have nothing to lose but their
lives

Faith can a man lose more asked Grey contemptuously He disliked
Wilding by instinct which was but a reciprocation of the feeling with
which Wilding was inspired by him

I think he can said Mr Wilding quietly A man may lose honour he
may plunge his family into ruin These are things of more weight with a
gentleman than life

Odds death blazed Grey giving a free rein to his dislike of this
calm gentleman Do you suggest that a mans honour is imperilled in His
Graces service

I suggest nothing answered Wilding unmoved What I think I state
If I thought a mans honour imperilled in this service you would not
see me at this table now I can make you no more convincing answer

Grey laughed unpleasantly and Wilding a faint tinge on his
cheekbones measured him with a stern intrepid look before which his
lordships shifty glance was observed to fall Wildings eye having
achieved that much passed from him to the Duke and its expression
softened

Your Grace sees said he how well founded were the fears I expressed
that your coming has been premature

In Gods name what would you have me do cried the Duke and
petulance made his voice unsteady

Mr Wilding rose moved out of his habitual calm by the earnestness
that pervaded him It is not for me to say again what I would have Your
Grace do Your Grace has heard my views and those of these gentlemen
It is for Your Grace to decide

You mean whether I will go forward with this thing What alternative
have I

No alternative put in Grey with finality Nor is alternative needed
Well carry this through in spite of timorous folk and birds of illomen
that croak to affright us

Our service is the service of the Lord cried Ferguson returning from
the window in the embrasure of which he had been standing the Lord
cannot but destine it to prevail

Ye said so before quoth Fletcher testily We need here men money
and weaponsnot divinity

You are plainly infected with Mr Wildings disease sneered Grey

Ford cried the Duke who saw Wildings eyes flash fire you go too
fast Mr Wilding you will not heed his lordship

I should not be likely to do so Your Grace answered Wilding who had
resumed his seat

What shall that mean quoth Grey leaping to his feet

Make it quite clear to him Tony whispered Trenchard coaxingly but
Mr Wilding was not as lost as were these immediate followers of the
Dukes to all sense of the respect due to His Grace

I think said Wilding quietly that you have forgotten something

Forgotten what bawled Grey

His Graces presence

His lordship turned crimson his anger swelled to think that the very
terms of the rebuke precluded his allowing his feelings a free rein

Monmouth leaned forward Sit down he said to Grey and Grey so
lately called to the respect he owed His Grace obeyed him You will
both promise me that this affair shall go no further I know you will
do it if I ask you particularly when you remember how few are the
followers upon whom I may depend I am not in case to lose either of you
through foolish words uttered in a heat which in both your hearts is
born I know of your loyalty to me

Greys coarse elderly face took on a sulky look his heavy lips were
pouted his glance sullen Mr Wilding on the contrary smiled across
the table

For my part I very gladly give Your Grace the undertaking said he
and took care not to observe the sneer that altered the line of Lord
Greys lips His lordship too was forced to give the same pledge and
he followed it up by inveighing sturdily against the suggestion that
they should retreat

I do protest he exclaimed that those who advise Your Grace to do
anything but go forward boldly now are evil counsellors If you put
back to Holland you may leave every hope behind There will be no
second coming for you Your influence will have been dissipated Men
will not trust you another time I do not think that even Mr Wilding
can deny the truth of this

I am by no means sure said Wilding and Fletcher looked at him with
eyes that were full of understanding This sturdy Scot the only soldier
worthy of the name in the Dukes following who ever since the project
had first been mooted had held out against it counselling delay was
in sympathy with Mr Wilding

Monmouth rose his face anxious his voice fretful There can be no
retreat for me gentlemen Though many that we depended upon are not
here to join us yet let us remember that Heaven is on our side and
that we are come to fight in the sacred cause of religion and a nations
emancipation from the thraldom of popery oppression and superstition
Let this dispel such doubts as yet may linger in our minds

His words had a brave sound but when analysed they but formed a
paraphrase of what Grey and Ferguson had said It was his destiny to be
a mere echo of the minds of other men just as he was now the tool
of these two one of whom plotted seemingly because plotting was a
disease that had got into his blood the other for reasons that may have
been of ambition or of revengeno man will ever know for certain

In the chamber they shared Trenchard and Mr Wilding reviewed that
night the scene so lately enacted in which one had taken an active
part the other been little more than a spectator Trenchard had come
from the Dukes presence entirely out of conceit with Monmouth and
his cause contemptuous of Ferguson angry with Grey and indifferent
towards Fletcher

I am committed and Ill not draw back said he but I tell you
Anthony my heart is not confederate with my hand in this Bah he
railed We serve a man of straw a Perkin a very pope of a fellow

Mr Wilding sighed Hes scarce the man for such an undertaking said
he I fear we have been misled

Trenchard was drawing off his boots He paused in the act Aye said
he misled by our blindness What else after all should we have
expected of him he cried contemptuously The Cause is good but its
leaderPshaw Would you have such a puppet as that on the throne of
England

He does not aim so high

Be not so sure We shall hear more of the black box anon and of the
marriage certificate it contains Twould not surprise me if they were
to produce forgeries of the one and the other to prove his fathers
marriage to Lucy Walters Anthony Anthony To what a business are we
wedded

Mr Wilding already abed turned impatiently Things cried aloud to be
redressed a leader was necessary and none other offered That is the
whole story But our chance is slender and it might have been great

That rakehell Ford Lord Grey has made it so grumbled Trenchard
busy with his stockings This sudden coming is his work You heard what
Fletcher saidhow he opposed it when first it was urged He paused
and looked up suddenly Blister me he cried is it his lordships
purpose think you to work the ruin of Monmouth

What are you saying Nick

There are certain rumours current touching His Grace and Lady Grey A
man like Grey might well resort to some such scheme of vengeance

Get to sleep Nick said Wilding yawning you are dreaming already
Such a plan would be over elaborate for his lordships mind It would
ask a villainy parallel with your own

Trenchard climbed into bed and settled himself under the coverlet

Maybe said he and maybe not but I think that were it not for that
cursed business of the letter Richard Westmacott stole from us I should
be going my ways tomorrow and leaving His Grace of Monmouth to go his

Aye and Id go with you answered Wilding Ive little taste for
suicide but we are in it now

Twas a sad pity you meddled this morning in that affair at Taunton
mused Trenchard wistfully A sadder pity you were bitten with a taste
for matrimony he added thoughtfully and blew out the rushlight






CHAPTER XV LYME OF THE KING

On the next day which was Friday the country folk continued to come
in and by evening Monmouths forces amounted to a thousand foot and
a hundred and fifty horse The men were armed as fast as they were
enrolled and scarce a field or quiet avenue in the district but
resounded to the tramp of feet the rattle of weapons and the sharp
orders of the officers who by drilling were converting this raw
material into soldiers On the Saturday the rally of the Dukes standard
was such that Monmouth threw off at last the gloomy forebodings that had
burdened his soul since that meeting on Thursday night Wade Holmes
Foulkes and Fox were able to set about forming the first four
regimentsthe Dukes and the Green the White and the Yellow
Monmouths spirits continued to rise for he had been joined by now
by Legge and Hooperthe two upon whom Battiscomb had countedand by
Colonel Joshua Churchill of whom Battiscomb had been less certain
Captain Matthews brought news that Lord Wiltshire and the gentlemen
of Hampshire might be expected if they could force their way through
Albemarles militia which was already closing round Lyme

Long before evening willing fellows were being turned away in hundreds
for lack of weapons In spite of Monmouths big talk on landing and of
the rumour that had gone out that he could arm thirty thousand men his
stock of arms was exhausted by a mere fifteen hundred Trenchard
who now held a Majors rank in the horse attached to the Dukes own
regiment was loud in his scorn of this state of things Mr Wilding was
sad and his depression again spread to the Duke after a few words had
passed between them towards evening Fletcher was for heroic measures
He looked only ahead now like the good soldier that he was and
already he began to suggest a bold dash for Exeter for weapons
horses and possibly the militia as well for they had ample evidence
that the men composing it might easily be induced to desert to the
Dukes side

The suggestion was one that instantly received Mr Wildings heartiest
approval It seemed to fill him suddenly with hope and he spoke of
it indeed as an inspiration which if acted upon might yet save the
situation The Duke was undecided as ever he was too much troubled
weighing the chances for and against and he would decide upon nothing
until he had consulted Grey and the others He would summon a council
that night he promised and the matter should be considered

But that council was never to be called for Andrew Fletchers
association with the rebellion was drawing rapidly to its close and
there was that to happen in the next few hours which should counteract
all the encouragement with which the Duke had been fortified that day
Towards evening little Heywood Dare the Taunton goldsmith who had
landed at Seatown and gone out with the news of the Dukes arrival rode
into Lyme with forty horse mounted himself upon a beautiful charger
which was destined to be the undoing of him

News came too that the Dorset militia were at Bridport eight miles
away whereupon Wilding and Fletcher postponed all further suggestion of
the dash for Exeter proposing that in the mean time a night attack upon
Bridport might result well For once Lord Grey was in agreement with
them and so the matter was decided Fletcher went down to arm and
mount and all the world knows the story of the foolish illfated
quarrel which robbed Monmouth of two of his most valued adherents
By illluck the Scots eyes lighted upon the fine horse that Dare had
brought from Ford Abbey It occurred to him that nothing could be more
fitting than that the best man should sit upon the best horse and he
forthwith led the beast from the stables and was about to mount when
Dare came forth to catch him in the very act The goldsmith was a rude
peppery fellow who did not mince his words

What a plague are you doing with that horse he cried

Fletcher paused one foot in the stirrup and looked the fellow up and
down I am mounting it said he and proceeded to do as he said

But Dare caught him by the tails of his coat and brought him back to
earth

You are making a mistake Mr Fletcher he cried angrily That horse
is mine

Fletcher whose temper was by no means of the most peaceful kept
himself with difficulty in hand at the indignity Dare offered him

Yours quoth he

Aye mine I brought it from Ford Abbey myself

For the Dukes service Fletcher reminded him

For my own sir for my own I would have you know And brushing
the Scot aside he caught the bridle and sought to wrench it from
Fletchers hand

But Fletcher maintained his hold Softly Mr Dare said he Yere
a trifle oer true to your name as you once told his late Majesty
yourself

Take your hands from my horse Dare shouted very angry

Several loiterers in the yard gathered round to watch the scene culling
diversion from it and speculating upon the conclusion it might have One
rash young fellow offered audibly to lay ten to one that Paymaster Dare
would have the best of the argument

Dare overheard and was spurred on

I will by God he answered Come Mr Fletcher And he shook the
bridle again

There was a dull flush showing through the tan of Fletchers skin
Mr Dare said he this horse is no more yours than mine It is the
Dukes and I as one o the leaders claim it in the Dukes service

Aye sir cried an onlooker encouraging Fletcher and did the
mischief It so goaded Dare to have his antagonist in this trifling
matter supported that he utterly lost his head

I have said the horse is mine and I repeat it Let go the bridlelet
it go Still Fletcher striving hard to keep his calm clung to the
reins Let it go you damned thieving Scot screamed Dare in a fury
and struck Fletcher with his whip

It was unfortunate for them both that he should have had that switch in
his hand at such a time but more unfortunate still was it that Fletcher
should have had a pistol in his belt The Scot dropped the bridle at
last dropped it to pluck forth the weapon

Hi I did not began Dare who had stood appalled by what he had
done in the second or two that had passed since he had delivered the
blow The rest of his sentence was drowned in the report of Fletchers
pistol and Dare dropped dead on the rough cobbles of the yard

Ferguson has left it on recordand presumably he had Fletchers
word for itthat it was no part of the Scots intent to do Mr Dare
a mischief He had but drawn the pistol to intimidate him into better
manners but in his haste he accidentally pulled the trigger

However that may be there was Dare as dead as the stones on which he
lay and Fletcher with a smoking pistol in his hand

After that all was confusion Fletcher was seized by those who had
witnessed the deed there was none thought it an accident indeed
they were all ready enough to say that Fletcher had received excessive
provocation He was haled to the presence of the Duke with whom
were Grey and Wilding at the time and old Dares sonan ensign in
Goodenoughs companycame clamouring for vengeance backed by such
goodly numbers that the distraught Duke was forced to show at least the
outward seeming of it

Wilding who knew the value of this Scottish soldier of fortune who had
seen so much service strenuously urged his enlargement It was not a
time to let the fortunes of a cause suffer through such an act as this
deplorable though it might be The evidence showed that Fletcher had
been provoked he had been struck a thing that might well justify the
anger in the heat of which he had done this thing Grey was stolid and
silent saying nothing either for or against the man who had divided
with him under the Duke the honours of the supreme command

Monmouth white and horrorstricken sat and listened first to
Wilding then to Dare and lastly to Fletcher himself But it was young
DareDare and his followers who prevailed They were too numerous and
turbulent and they must at all costs be conciliated or there was no
telling to what extremes they might not go And so there was an end to
the share of Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun in this undertakingthe end of
the only man who was of any capacity to pilot it through the troubled
waters that lay before it Monmouth placed him under arrest and sent him
aboard the frigate again ordering her captain to sail at once That was
the utmost Monmouth could do to save him

Wilding continued to plead with the Duke after Fletchers removal and
to such good purpose that at last Monmouth determined that Fletcher
should rejoin them later when the affair should have blown over and
he sent word accordingly to the Scot Even in this there were
manifestations of antagonism between Mr Wilding and Lord Grey and it
almost seemed enough that Wilding should suggest a course for Lord Grey
instantly to oppose it

The effects of Fletchers removal were not long in following On the
morrow came the Bridport affair and Greys shameful conduct when had
he stood his ground victory must have been assured the Dukes forces
instead of just that honourable retreat by which Colonel Wade so
gallantly saved the situation Mr Wilding did not mince his words in
putting it that Grey had run away

In his room at the George Inn Monmouth deeply distressed asked
Wilding and Colonel Matthews what action he should take in the
matterhow deal with Grey

There is no other general in Europe would ask that Your Grace
answered Matthews gravely and Mr Wilding added without an instants
hesitation that His Graces course was plain

It would be an unwise thing to expose the troops to the chance of more
such happenings

Monmouth dismissed them and sent for Grey and he seemed resolved to
deal with him as he deserved Yet an hour later when Wilding Matthews
Wade and the others were ordered to attend the Duke in council there
was his lordship seemingly on as good terms as ever with His Grace

They were assembled to discuss the next step which it might be advisable
to take for the militia was closing in around them and to remain
longer in Lyme would be to be caught there as in a trap It was Grey
who advanced the first suggestion his assurance no whit abated by
the shameful thing that had befallen by the cowardice which he had
betrayed

That we must quit Lyme we are all agreed said he I would propose
that Your Grace march north to Gloucester where our Cheshire friends
will assemble to meet us

Colonel Matthews reminded the Duke of Andrew Fletchers proposal that
they should make a raid upon Exeter with a view to seizing arms of
which they stood so sorely in need

This Mr Wilding was quick to support Not only that Your Grace he
said but I am confident that with very little inducement the greater
portion of the militia will desert to us as soon as we appear

What assurance can you give of that asked Grey his heavy lip
protruded

I take it said Mr Wilding that in such matters no man can give
an assurance of anything I speak with knowledge of the country and the
folk from which the militia is enlisted I offer it as my opinion that
the militia is favourably disposed to Your Grace I can do no more

If Mr Wilding says so Your Grace put in Matthews I have no doubt
he has sound reasons upon which to base his opinion

No doubt said Monmouth Indeed I had already thought of the step
that you suggest Colonel Matthews and what Mr Wilding says causes me
to look upon it still more favourably

Grey frowned Consider Your Grace he said earnestly that you are
in no case to fight at present

What fighting do you suggest there would be asked the Duke

There is Albemarle between us and Exeter

But with the militia Wilding reminded him and if the militia
deserts him for Your Grace in what case will Albemarle find himself

And if the militia does not desert If you should be proven wrong sir
What then What then asked Grey

Ayetruewhat then Mr Wilding quoth the Duke already wavering

Wilding considered a moment all eyes upon him Even then said he
presently I do maintain that in this dash for Exeter lies Your Graces
greatest chance of success We can deliver battle if need be Already we
are three thousand strong

Grey interrupted him rudely Nay he insisted You must not presume
upon that We are not yet fit to fight It is His Graces business at
present to drill and discipline his troops and induce more friends to
join him

Already we are turning men away because we have no weapons to put into
their hands Wilding reminded them and a murmur of approval ran round
which but served to anger Grey the more to render more obstinate his
opposition

But all that come in are not unprovided was his lordships retort
There are the Hampshire gentry and their friends They will come armed
and so will others if we have patience

Aye said Wilding and if you have patience enough there will be
troops the Parliament will send against us They too will be armed I
can assure your lordship

In Gods name let us keep from wrangling the Duke besought them It
is difficult enough to determine for the best If the dash to Exeter
were successful

It cannot be Grey interrupted again

The liberties he took with Monmouth and which Monmouth permitted him
might well be a source of wonder to all who heard them Monmouth paused
now in his interrupted speech and looked about him a trifle wearily

It seems idle to insist said Mr Wilding such is the temper of Your
Graces counsellors that we get no further than contradictions Greys
bold eyes were upon Wilding as he spoke I would remind Your Grace
and I am sure that many present will agree with me that in a desperate
enterprise a sudden unexpected movement will often strike terror

That is true said Monmouth but apparently without enthusiasm and
having approved what was urged on one side he looked at Grey as if
waiting to hear what might be said on the other His indecision was
pitifultragical indeed in the leader of so bold an enterprise

We should do better I think said Grey to deal with the facts as we
know them

It is what I am endeavouring to do Your Grace protested Wilding
a note of despair in his voice Perhaps some other gentleman will put
forward better counsel than mine

Aye In Heavens name let us hope so snorted Grey and Monmouth
catching the sudden flash of Mr Wildings eye set a hand upon his
lordships arm as if to urge him to be gentler But he continued When
men talk of striking terror by sudden movements they build on air

I had hardly thought to hear that from your lordship said Mr
Wilding and he permitted himself that tightlipped smile that gave his
face so wicked a look

And why not asked Grey stupidly unsuspicious

Because I had thought you might have concluded otherwise from your own
experience at Bridport this morning

Grey got angrily to his feet rage and shame flushing his face and it
needed Ferguson and the Duke to restore him to some semblance of calm
Indeed it may well be that it was to complete this that His Grace
decided there and then that they should follow Greys advice and go by
way of Taunton Bridgwater and Bristol to Gloucester He was like all
weak men of conspicuous mental shortsightedness The matter of the
moment was ever of greater importance to him than any result that might
attend it in the future

He insisted that Wilding and Grey should shake hands before the breaking
up of that most astounding council and as he had done last night he
now again imposed upon them his commands that they must not allow this
matter to go further

Mr Wilding paved the way for peace by making an apology within
limitations

If in my zeal to serve Your Grace to the best of my ability I have
said that which Lord Grey thinks fit to resent I would bid him consider
my motive rather than my actual words

But when all had gone save Ferguson the chaplain approached the
preoccupied and distressed Duke with counsel that Mr Wilding should be
sent away from the army

Else therell be trouble twixt him and Grey the plotting parson
foretold Well be having a repetition of the unfortunate Fletcher and
Dare affair and I think that has cost Your Grace enough already

Do you suggest that I dismiss Wilding cried the Duke You know his
influence and the bad impression his removal would leave

Ferguson stroked his long lean jaw No no said he all I suggest is
that you find Mr Wilding work to do elsewhere

Elsewhere the Duke questioned Where else

I have thought of that too Send him to London to see Danvers and to
stir up your friends there And he added lowering his voice give
him discretion to see Sunderland if he thinks well

The proposition pleased Monmouth and it seemed to please Mr Wilding
no less when having sent for him the Duke communicated it to him in
Fergusons presence

Upon this mission Mr Wilding set out that very night leaving Nick
Trenchard in despair at being separated from him at a time when there
seemed to be every chance that such a separation might be eternal

Monmouth and Ferguson may have conceived they did a wise thing in
removing a man who was instinctively spoiling for a little swordplay
with my Lord Grey It is odds that had he remained the brewing storm
between the pair would have come to a head Had it done so it is more
than likely from what we know of Mr Wildings accomplishments that
he had given Lord Grey his quietus And had that happened it is to
be inferred from history that it is possible the Duke of Monmouths
rebellion might have had a less disastrous issue






CHAPTER XVI PLOTS AND PLOTTERS

Mr Wilding left Monmouths army at Lyme on Sunday the 14th of
June and rejoined it at Bridgwater exactly three weeks later In the
meanwhile a good deal had happened yet the happenings on every hand had
fallen far short of the expectations aroused in Mr Wildings mind
now by one circumstance now by another In reaching London he had
experienced no difficulty Men travelling in that direction were not
subjected to the scrutiny that fell to the share of those travelling
from it towards the West or rather to the scrutiny ordained by the
Government for Wilding had more than one opportunity of observing
how very lax and indifferent were the constables and
tythingmenparticularly in Somerset and Wiltshirein the performance
of this duty Wayfarers were questioned as a matter of form but in no
case did Wilding hear of any one being detained upon suspicion This
was calculated to raise his drooping hopes pointing as it did to the
general favouring of Monmouth that was toward He grew less despondent
on the score of the Dukes possible ultimate success and he came to
hope that the efforts he went to exert would not be fruitless

But rude were the disappointments that awaited him in town London like
the rest of the country was not ready There were not wanting men who
favoured Monmouth but no rising had been organized and the Dukes
partisans were not disposed to rashness

Wilding lodged at Covent Garden in a house recommended to him by
Colonel Danvers and therean outlaw himselfhe threw himself with a
will into his task He heard of the burning of Monmouths Declaration by
the common hangman at the Royal Exchange and of the bill passed by
the Commons to make it treason for any to assert that Lucy Walters was
married to the late King He attended meetings at the Bulls Head
in Bishopsgate where he met Disney and Danvers Payton and Lock but
though they talked and argued at prodigious length they did naught
besides Danvers who was their hope in town definitely refused to have
a hand in anything that was not properly organized and in common with
the others urged that they should wait until Cheshire had risen as was
reported that it must

Meanwhile troops had gone west under Kirke and Churchill and the
Parliament had voted nearly half a million for the putting down of the
rebellion London was flung into a fever of excitement by the news
that was reaching it The position was not quite as Monmouths
advisersbefore coming over from Hollandhad represented that it would
be They had thought that out of fear of tumults about his own person
King James would have been compelled to keep near him what troops he
had sparing none to be sent against Monmouth This King James had not
done he had all but emptied London of soldiery and considering the
general disaffection no moment could have been more favourable than
this for a rising in London itself The confusion that must have
resulted from the recalling of troops would have given Monmouth not
only a mighty grip of the West but would have heartened those wholike
Sunderland himselfwere sitting on the wall to declare themselves for
the Protestant Champion This Wilding saw and almost frenziedly did he
urge it upon Danvers that all London needed at the moment was a resolute
leader But the Colonel still held back indeed he had neither truth
nor valour he was timid and used deceit to mask his timidity he urged
frivolous reasons for inaction and when Wilding waxed impatient with
him he suggested that Wilding himself should head the rising if he were
so confident of its success And Wilding would have done it but that
being unknown in London he had no reason to suppose that men would
flock to him if he raised the Dukes banner

Later when the excitement grew and rumours ran through town that
Monmouth had now a following of twenty thousand men and that the Kings
forces were falling back before him and discontent was rife at the
commissioning of Catholic lords to levy troops Wilding again pressed
the matter upon Danvers Surely no moment could be more propitious
But again he received the same answer that Danvers had lacked time to
organize matters sufficiently that the Dukes coming had taken him by
surprise

Lastly came the news that Monmouth had been crowned at Taunton amid the
wildest enthusiasm and that there were now in England two men each
of whom called himself King James the Second This was the excuse
that Danvers needed to be rid of a business he had not the courage to
transact to a finish He swore that he washed his hands of Monmouths
affairs that the latter had broken faith with him and the promise
he had made him in having himself proclaimed King He protested that
Monmouth had done ill and prophesied that his act would alienate from
him the numerous republicans who like Danvers had hitherto looked to
him for the countrys salvation Wilding himself was appalled at the
news for Monmouth was indeed going further than men had been given to
understand Nevertheless for his own sake in very selfdefence now
if out of no motives of loyalty to the Duke he must urge forward the
fortunes of this man He had high words with Danvers and the two might
have quarrelled before long but for the sudden arrest of Disney which
threw Danvers into such a panic that he fled incontinently abandoning
in body as he already appeared to have abandoned in spirit the
Monmouth Cause

The arrest of Disney struck a chill into Wilding From his lodging at
Covent Garden he had communicated cautiously with Sunderland a few days
after his arrival building upon certain information he had received
from the Duke at parting as to Sunderlands attachment to the Cause He
had carefully chosen his moment for making this communication having
a certain innate mistrust of a man who so obviously as Sunderland was
running with the hare and hunting with the hounds He had sent a letter
to the Secretary of State when London was agog with the Axminster
affair and the taleof which Sir Edward Phelips wrote to Colonel
Berkeley as the shamefullest story that you ever heardof how
Albemarles forces and the Somerset militia had run before Monmouth in
spite of their own overwhelming numbers This promised ill for James
particularly when it was perceived as perceived it wasthat this
running away was not all cowardice not all the shamefullest story
that Phelips accounted it It was an expression of goodwill towards
Monmouth on the part of the militia of the West and it was confidently
expected that the next news would be that these men who had decamped
before him would presently be found to have ranged themselves under his
banner

Sunderland had given no sign that he had received Wildings
communication And Wilding drew his own contemptuous conclusions of the
Secretary of States cautious policy It was a fortnight laterwhen
London was settling down again from the diversion of excitement created
by the news of Argyles defeat in Scotlandbefore Mr Wilding attempted
to approach Sunderland again He awaited a favourable opportunity and
this he had when London was thrown into consternation by the alarming
news of the Duke of Somersets urgent demand for reinforcements Unless
he had them he declared the whole country was lost as he could not
get the militia to stand whilst Lord Stawells regiment were all fled
and mostly gone over to the rebels at Bridgwater

This was grave news but it was followed in a few days by graver The
affair at Philips Norton was exaggerated by report into a wholesale
defeat of the loyal army and it was reportedon apparently such good
authority that it received credence in quarters that might have waited
for official newsthat the Duke of Albemarle had been slain by the
militia which had mutinied and deserted to Monmouth

It was while this news was going round that Sunderlandin a moment of
panicat last vouchsafed an answer to Mr Wildings letters and he
vouchsafed it in person just as Wildingparticularly since Disneys
arrestwas beginning to lose all hope He came one evening to Mr
Wildings lodgings in Covent Garden unattended and closely muffled and
he remained closeted with the Dukes ambassador for nigh upon an hour
at the end of which he entrusted Mr Wilding with a letter for the Duke
very brief but entirely to the point which expressed him Monmouths
most devoted servant

You may well judge sir he had said at parting that this is not
such a letter as I should entrust to any man

Mr Wilding had bowed gravely and gravely he had expressed himself
sensible of the exceptional honour his lordship did him by such a trust

And I depend upon you sir as you are a man of honour to take such
measures as will ensure against its falling into any but the hands for
which it is intended

As I am a man of honour you may depend upon me Mr Wilding solemnly
promised Will your lordship give me three lines above your signature
that will save me from molestation thus you will facilitate the
preservation of this letter

I had already thought of that was Sunderlands answer and he placed
before Mr Wilding three lines of writing signed and sealed which
enjoined all straitly in the Kings name to suffer the bearer to pass
and repass and to offer him no hindrance

On that they shook hands and parted Sunderland to return to Whitehall
and his obedience to the King James whom he was ready to betray as
soon as he saw profit for himself in the act Mr Wilding to return to
Somerset to the King James in whom his faith was scant indeed but with
whom his fortunes were irrevocably bound up

Meanwhile Monmouth was back in Bridgwater his second occupation
of which town was not being looked upon with unmixed favour The
inhabitants had suffered enough already from his first visit his return
there after the Philips Norton affair of which such grossly exaggerated
reports had reached London and which in point of fact had been little
better than a drawn battlehad been looked upon with dread by some
with disfavour by others and with dismay by not a few who viewed in
this an augury of failure

Now Sir Rowland Blake who since his pursuit of Mr Wilding and
Trenchard on the occasion of their flight from Taunton hadin spite
of his failure on that occasionbeen more or less in the service of
Albemarle and the loyal army saw in this indisposition towards Monmouth
of so many of Bridgwaters inhabitants great possibilities of profit to
himself

He was at Lupton House the guest of his friend Richard Westmacott and
the open suitor of Ruth entirely ignoring the circumstance that she was
nominally the wife of Mr Wildingthis to the infinite chagrin of Miss
Horton who saw all her scheming likely to go for nothing

In his heart of hearts it was a matter of not the slightest consequence
to Sir Rowland whether James Stuart or James Scott occupied the throne
of England His own affairs gave him more than enough to think of and
these disturbances in the West were very welcome to him since they
rendered difficult any attempt to trace him on the part of his London
creditors It happens however very commonly that enmity to an
individual will lead to enmity to the cause which that individual
espouses Thus may it have been with Sir Rowland His hatred of Wilding
and his keen desire to see Wilding destroyed had made him a zealous
partisan of the loyal cause Richard Westmacott easily swayed and
overborne by the town rake whose vices made him seem to Richard the
embodiment of all that is splendid and enviable in man had become
practically the baronets tool now that he had abandoned Monmouths
Cause Sir Rowland had not considered it beneath the dignity of his name
and station to discharge in Bridgwater certain functions that made him
more or less a spy And so reliable had been the information he had sent
Feversham and Albemarle during Monmouths first occupation of the town
that he had won by now their complete confidence

The second occupation and its unpopularity with many of those who
earlierif lukewarmhad been partisans of the Duke swelled the number
of loyally inclined people in Bridgwater and suddenly inspired
Sir Rowland with a scheme by which at a blow he might snuff out the
rebellion

This scheme involved the capture of the Duke and the reward of success
should mean far more to Blake than the five thousand pounds at which the
value of the Dukes head had already been fixed by Parliament He needed
a tool for this and he even thought of Westmacott and Lupton House but
afterwards preferred a Mr Newlington who was in better case to assist
him This Newlington an exceedingly prosperous merchant and one of the
richest men perhaps in the whole West of England looked with extreme
disfavour upon Monmouth whose advent had paralyzed his industries to an
extent that was costing him a fine round sum of money weekly

He was now in alarm lest the town of Bridgwater should be made to
pay dearly for having harboured the Protestant Dukehe had no faith
whatever in the Protestant Dukes ultimate prevailingand that he
as one of the towns most prominent and prosperous citizens might
be amongst the heaviest sufferers in spite of his neutrality This
neutrality he observed because it was hardly safe in that disaffected
town for a man to proclaim himself a loyalist

To him Sir Rowland expounded his audacious plan He sought out the
merchant in his handsome mansion on the night of that Friday which had
witnessed Monmouths return and the merchant honoured by the visit of
this gallantignorant as he was of the gentlemans fame in townplaced
himself entirely and instantly at his disposal though the hour was
late Sounding him carefully and finding the fellow most amenable
to any scheme that should achieve the salvation of his purse and
industries Blake boldly laid his plan before him Startled at first
Mr Newlington upon considering it became so enthusiastic that he hailed
Sir Rowland as his deliverer and heartily promised his cooperation
Indeed it was Mr Newlington who was himself to take the first step

Well pleased with his evenings work Sir Rowland went home to Lupton
House and to bed In the morning he broached the matter to Richard He
had all the vanity of the inferior not only to lessen the appearance of
his inferiority but to clothe himself in a mantle of importance and it
was this vanity urged him to acquaint Richard with his plans in the very
presence of Ruth

They had broken their fast and they still lingered in the diningroom
the largest and most important room in Lupton House It was cool and
pleasant here in contrast to the heat of the July sun which following
upon the late wet weather beat fiercely on the lawn the windowdoors
to which stood open The cloth had been raised and Diana and her mother
had lately left the room Ruth in the windowseat at a small oval
table was arranging a cluster of roses in an old bronze bowl Sir
Rowland his stiff short figure carefully dressed in a suit of brown
camlet his fair wig very carefully curled occupied a tallbacked
armchair near the empty fireplace Richard perched on the tables edge
swung his shapely legs idly backwards and forwards and cogitated upon a
pretext to call for a morning draught of last Octobers ale

Ruth completed her task with the roses and turned her eyes upon her
brother

You are not looking well Richard she said which was true enough
for much hard drinking was beginning to set its stamp on Richard and
young as he was his insipidly fair face began to display a bloatedness
that was exceedingly unhealthy

Oh I am well enough he answered almost peevishly for these
allusions to his looks were becoming more frequent than he savoured

Gad cried Sir Rowlands deep voice youll need to be well I have
work for you tomorrow Dick

Dick did not appear to share his enthusiasm I am sick of the work you
discover for us Rowland he answered ungraciously

But Blake showed no resentment Maybe youll find the present task more
to your taste If its deeds of derringdo you pine for I am the man
to satisfy you He smiled grimly his bold grey eyes glancing across at
Ruth who was observing him listening

Richard sneered but offered him no encouragement to proceed

I see said Blake that I shall have to tell you the whole story
before youll credit me Shalt have it then But and he checked on
the word his face growing serious his eye wandering to the door I
would not have it overheardnot for a kings ransom which was more
literally true than he may have intended it to be

Richard looked over his shoulder carelessly at the door

We have no eavesdroppers he said and his voice bespoke his contempt
of the gravity of this news of which Sir Rowland made so much in
anticipation He was acquainted with Sir Rowlands ways and the
importance of them What are you considering he inquired

To end the rebellion answered Blake his voice cautiously lowered

Richard laughed outright There are several others considering
thatnotably His Majesty King James the Duke of Albemarle and the
Earl of Feversham Yet they dont appear to achieve it

It is in that particular said Blake complacently that I shall
differ from them He turned to Ruth eager to engage her in the
conversation to flatter her by including her in the secret Knowing the
loyalist principles she entertained he had no reason to fear that his
plans could other than meet her approval What do you say Mistress
Ruth Presuming upon his friendship with her brother he had taken to
calling her by that name in preference to the other which he could not
bring himself to give her Is it not an object worthy of a gentlemans
endeavour

If you can save so many poor people from encompassing their ruin by
following that rash young man the Duke of Monmouth you will indeed be
doing a worthy deed

Blake rose and made her a leg Madam said he had aught been
wanting to cement my resolve your words would supply it to me My plan
is simplicity itself I propose to capture Monmouth and his principal
agents and deliver them over to the King And that is all

A mere nothing croaked Richard

Could more be needed quoth Blake Once the rebel army is deprived of
its leaders it will melt and dissolve of itself Once the Duke is in the
hands of his enemies there will be nothing left to fight for Is it not
shrewd

You are telling us the object rather than the plan Ruth reminded him
If the plan is as good as the object

As good he echoed chuckling You shall judge And briefly he
sketched for her the springe he was setting with the help of Mr
Newlington Newlington is rich the Duke is in straits for money
Newlington goes today to offer him twenty thousand pounds and the Duke
is to do him the honour of supping at his house tomorrow night to fetch
the money It is a reasonable request for Mr Newlington to make under
the circumstances and the Duke cannotdare not refuse it

But how will that advance your project Ruth inquired for Blake had
paused again thinking that the rest must be obvious

In Mr Newlingtons orchard I propose to post a score or so of men
well armed Oh I shall run no risks of betrayal by engaging Bridgwater
folk Ill get the fellows I need from General Feversham We take
Monmouth at supper as quietly as may be with what gentlemen happen to
have accompanied him We bind and gag the Duke and we convey him with
all speed and quiet out of Bridgwater Feversham shall send a troop to
await me a mile or so from the town on the road to Weston Zoyland We
shall join them with our captive and thus convey him to the Royalist
General Could aught be simpler or more infallible

Richard had slipped from the table He had changed his mind on the
subject of the importance of the business Blake had in view Excited by
it he clapped his friend on the back approvingly

A great plan he cried Is it not Ruth

It should be the means of saving hundreds perhaps thousands of lives
said she and so it deserves to prosper But what of the officers who
may be with the Duke she inquired

There are not likely to be manyhalf a dozen say We shall have to
make short work of them lest they should raise an alarm He saw her
glance clouding That is the ugly part of the affair he was quick
to add himself assuming a look of sadness He sighed What help is
there he asked Better that those few should suffer than that as you
yourself have said there should be some thousands of lives lost before
this rebellion is put down Besides he continued Monmouths officers
are farseeing ambitious men who have entered into this affair to
promote their own personal fortunes They are gamesters who have set
their lives upon the board against a great prize and they know it But
these other poor misguided people who have gone out to fight for liberty
and religionit is these whom I am striving to rescue

His words sounded fervent his sentiments almost heroic Ruth looked at
him and wondered had she misjudged him in the past She sighed Then
she thought of Wilding He was on the other side but where was he
Rumour ran that he was dead that he and Grey had quarrelled at Lyme
and that Wilding had been killed as a result Had it not been for Diana
who strenuously bade her attach no credit to these reports she would
readily have believed them As it was she waited wondering thinking of
him always as she had seen him on that day at Walford when he had taken
his leave of her and more than once when she pondered the words he had
said the look that had invested his drooping eyes she found herself
with tears in her own They welled up now and she rose hastily to her
feet

She looked a moment at Blake who was watching her keenly speculating
upon this emotion of which she betrayed some sign and wondering might
not his heroism have touched her for as we have seen he had arrayed
a deed of excessive meanness a deed worthy almost of the Iscariot in
the panoply of heroic achievement

I think she said that you are setting your hand to a very worthy
and glorious enterprise and I hope nay I am sure that success must
attend your efforts He was still bowing his thanks when she passed out
through the open windowdoors into the sunshine of the garden

Sir Rowland swung round upon Richard A great enterprise Dick he
cried I may count upon you for one

Aye said Dick who had found at last the pretext that he needed
you may count on me Pull the bell well drink to the success of the
venture






CHAPTER XVII MR WILDINGS RETURN

The preparations to be made for the momentous coup Sir Rowland meditated
were considerable Mr Newlington was yet to be concerted with and
advised and that done Sir Rowland had to face the difficulty of
eluding the Bridgwater guards and make his way to Fevershams camp at
Somerton to enlist the generals cooperation to the extent that we
have seen he looked for That done he was to return and ripen his
preparations for the business he had undertaken Nevertheless in spite
of all that lay before him he did not find it possible to leave Lupton
House without stepping out into the garden in quest of Ruth Through
the window whilst he and Richard were at their ale he had watched her
between whiles and had lingered waiting for Diana was with her and
it was not his wish to seek her whilst Diana was at hand Speak with
her ere he went he must He was an opportunist and now he fondly
imagined was his opportunity He had made that day at last a
favourable impression upon Richards sister he had revealed himself in
an heroic light and egregiously misreading the emotion she had shown
before withdrawing he was satisfied that did he strike now victory must
attend him He sighed his satisfaction and pleasurable anticipation He
had been wary and he had known how to wait and now it seemed to him
he was to be rewarded for his patience Then he frowned as another
glance showed him that Diana still lingered with her cousin he wished
Diana at the devil He had come to hate this fairhaired doll to whom
he had once paid court She was too continually in his way a constant
obstacle in his path ever ready to remind Ruth of Anthony Wilding when
Sir Rowland most desired Anthony Wilding to be forgotten and in Dianas
feelings towards himself such a change had been gradually wrought that
she had come to reciprocate his sentimentsto hate him with all the
bitter hatred into which love can be by scorn transmuted At first her
object in keeping Ruths thoughts on Mr Wilding in pleading his cause
and seeking to present him in a favourable light to the lady whom he had
constrained to become his wife had been that he might stand a barrier
between Ruth and Sir Rowland to the end that Diana might hope to see
revivedfaute de mieux since possible in no other waythe feelings
that once Sir Rowland had professed for herself The situation was
rich in humiliations for poor vain foolishly crafty Diana and these
humiliations were daily rendered more bitter by Sir Rowlands unwavering
courtship of her cousin in spite of all that she could do

In the end the poison of them entered her soul corroded her sentiments
towards him dissolved the love she had borne him and transformed
it into venom She would not have him now if he did penitence for his
disaffection by going in sackcloth and crawling after her on his knees
for a full twelvemonth But neither should he have Ruth if she could
thwart his purpose On that she was resolved

Had she but guessed that he watched them from the windows waiting for
her to take her departure she had lingered all the morning and all
the afternoon if need be at Ruths side But being ignorant of
the circumstancebelieving that he had already left the houseshe
presently quitted Ruth to go indoors and no sooner was she gone than
there was Blake replacing her at Ruths elbow Mistress Wilding met him
with unsmiling but not ungentle face

Not yet gone Sir Rowland she asked him and a less sanguine man had
been discouraged by the words

It may be forgiven me that I tarry at such a time said he when we
consider that I go perhapsto return no more It was an inspiration
on his part to assume the role of the hero going forth to a possible
death It invested him with noble valiant pathos which could not he
thought fail of its effect upon a womans mind But he looked in vain
for a change of colour be it ever so slight or a quickening of the
breath He found neither though indeed her deep blue eyes seemed to
soften as they observed him

There is danger in this thing that you are undertaking said she
between question and assertion

It is not my wish to overstate it yet I leave you to imagine what the
risk may be

It is a good cause said she thinking of the poor deluded humble
folk that followed Monmouths banner whom Blakes fine action was to
rescue from impending ruin and annihilation and surely Heaven will be
on your side

We must prevail cried Blake with kindling eye and you had thought
him a fanatic not a miserable earner of bloodmoney We must
prevail though some of us may pay dearly for the victory I have a
foreboding He paused sighed then laughed and flung back his head
as if throwing off some weight that had oppressed him

It was admirably played Nick Trenchard had he observed it might have
envied the performance and it took effect with her this adding of a
prospective martyrs crown to the heros raiment he had earlier donned
It was a mastertouch worthy of one who was deeply learnedfrom the
school of foul experiencein the secret ways that lead to a womans
favour In a pursuit of this kind there was no subterfuge too mean no
treachery too base for Sir Rowland Blake

Will you walk mistress he said and she feeling that it were an
unkindness not to do his will assented gravely They moved down the
sloping lawn side by side Sir Rowland leaning on his cane bareheaded
his feathered hat tucked under his arm Before them the rivers smooth
expanse swollen and yellow with the recent rains glowed like a sheet
of copper so that it blurred the sight to look upon it long

A few steps they took with no word uttered then Sir Rowland spoke
With this foreboding that is on me said he I could not go without
seeing you without saying something that I may never have another
chance of saying something thatwho knowsbut for the emprise to
which I am now wedded you had never heard from me

He shot her a furtive sidelong glance from under his heavy beetling
brows and now indeed he observed a change ripple over the composure
of her face like a sudden breeze across a sheet of water The deep lace
collar at her throat rose and fell and her fingers toyed nervously with
a ribbon of her grey bodice She recovered in an instant and threw up
entrenchments against the attack she saw he was about to make

You exaggerate I trust said she Your forebodings will be proved
groundless You will return safe and sound from this venture as indeed
I hope you may

That was his cue You hope it he cried arresting his step turning
and imprisoning her left hand in his right You hope it Ah if you
hope for my return return I will but unless I know that you will have
some welcome for me such as I desire from you I think his
voice quivered cleverly I think perhaps it were well if if
my forebodings were not as groundless as you say they are Tell me
Ruth

But she interrupted him It was high time she thought Her face he saw
was flushed her eyes had hardened somewhat Calmly she disengaged her
hand

What ist you mean she asked Speak Sir Rowland speak plainly
that I may give you a plain answer

It was a challenge in which another man had seen how hopeless was his
case and accepting defeat had made as orderly a retreat as still was
possible But Sir Rowland stricken in his vanity went headlong on to
utter rout

Since you ask me in such terms I will be plain indeed he answered
her I mean He almost quailed before the look that met him from her
intrepid eyes Do you not see my meaning Ruth

That which I see said she I do not believe and as I would not
wrong you by any foolish imaginings I would have you plain with me

Yet the egregious fool went on And why should you not believe your
senses he asked her between anger and entreaty Is it wonderful that
I should love you Is it

Stop She drew back a pace from him There was a moments silence
during which it seemed she gathered her forces to destroy him and
in the spirit he bowed his head before the coming storm Then with a
sudden relaxing of the stiffness her lissom figure had assumed I think
you had better leave me Sir Rowland she advised him She half turned
and moved a step away he followed with lowering glance his upper lip
lifting and laying bare his powerful teeth In a stride he was beside
her

Do you hate me Ruth he asked her hoarsely

Why should I hate you she counterquestioned sadly I do not even
dislike you she continued in a more friendly tone adding as if by
way of explaining this phenomenon You are my brothers friend But I
am disappointed in you Sir Rowland You had I know no intention of
offering me disrespect and yet it is what you have done

As how he asked

Knowing me anothers wife

He broke in tempestuously A mock marriage If it is but that scruple
stands between us

I think there is more she answered him You compel me to hurt you I
do so as the surgeon doesthat I may heal you

Why thanks for nothing he made answer unable to repress a sneer
Then checking himself and resuming the heromartyr posture I go
mistress he told her sadly and if I lose my life tonight or
tomorrow in this affair

I shall pray for you said she for she had found him out at
last perceived the nature of the bow he sought to draw across her
heartstrings and having perceived it contempt awoke in her He had
attempted to move her by unfair insidious means

He fell back crimson from chin to brow He stifled the wrath that
welled up threatening to choke him He was a shortnecked man of the
sortas Trenchard had once reminded himthat falls a prey to apoplexy
and surely he was never nearer it than at that moment He made her a
profound bow bending himself almost in two before her in a very irony
of deference then drawing himself up again he turned and left her

The plot which with some pride he had hatched and the reward he looked
to cull from it were now to his soul as ashes to his lips What could
it profit him to destroy Monmouth so that Anthony Wilding lived For
whether she loved Wilding or not she was Wildings wife Wilding
nominally at least was master of that which Sir Rowland coveted
not her heart indeed but her ample fortune Wilding had been a
stumblingblock to him since he had come to Bridgwater but for Wilding
he might have run a smooth course he was still fool enough to hug
that dear illusion to his soul Somewhere in Englandif not dead
alreadythis Wilding lurked an outlaw whom any might shoot down at
sight Sir Rowland swore he would not rest until he knew that Anthony
Wilding cumbered the earth no moreleastways not the surface of it

He went forth to seek Newlington The merchant had sent his message
to the rebel King and had word in answer that His Majesty would be
graciously pleased to sup at Mr Newlingtons at nine oclock on
the following evening attended by a few gentlemen of his immediate
following Sir Rowland received the news with satisfaction and sighed
to think that Mr Wildingstill absent Heaven knew wherewould not be
of the party It was reported that on the Monday Monmouth was to march
to Gloucester hoping there to be joined by his Cheshire friends so
that it seemed Sir Rowland had not matured his plan a day too soon
He got to horse and contriving to win out of Bridgwater rode off to
Somerton to concert with Lord Feversham concerning the men he would need
for his undertaking

That night Richard made free talk of the undertaking to Diana and to
Ruth loving as does the pusillanimous to show himself engaged in
daring enterprises Emulating his friend Sir Rowland he held forth
with prolixity upon the great service he was to do the State and Ruth
listening to him was proud of his zeal the sincerity of which it never
entered her mind to doubt

Diana listened too but without illusions concerning Master Richard
and she kept her conclusions to herself

During the afternoon of the morrow which was Sunday Sir Rowland
returned to Bridgwater his mission to Feversham entirely successful
and all preparations made He completed his arrangements and towards
eight oclock that night the twenty men sent by Fevershamthey had
slipped singly into the townbegan to muster in the orchard at the back
of Mr Newlingtons house

It was just about that same hour that Mr Wilding saddleworn and
dustclogged in every pore rode into Bridgwater and made his way to
the sign of The Ship in the High Street overlooking the Cross where
Trenchard was lodged His friend was absentpossibly gone with his men
to the sermon Ferguson was preaching to the army in the Castle Fields
Having put up his horse Mr Wilding all dusty as he was repaired
straight to the Castle to report himself to Monmouth

He was informed that His Majesty was in council Nevertheless urging
that his news was of importance he begged to be instantly announced
After a pause he was ushered into a lofty roomy chamber where in
the fading daylight King Monmouth sat in council with Grey and Wade
Matthews Speke Ferguson and others At the foot of the table stood a
sturdy countryfellow unknown to Wilding It was Godfrey the spy who
was to act as their guide across Sedgemoor that night for the matter
that was engaging them just then was the completion of their plans
for the attack that was to be made that very night upon Fevershams
unprepared campa matter which had been resolved during the last few
hours as an alternative preferable to the retreat towards Gloucester
that had at first been intended

Wilding was shocked at the change that had been wrought in Monmouths
appearance during the few weeks since last he had seen him His face
was thin pale and haggard his eyes were more sombre and beneath them
there were heavy dark stains of sleeplessness and care his very voice
when presently he spoke seemed to have lost the musical timbre that had
earlier distinguished it it was grown harsh and rasping Disappointment
after disappointment set down to illluck but in reality the fruit of
incompetence had served to sour him The climax had been reached in
the serious desertions after the Philips Norton fight and the flight
of Paymaster Goodenough with the funds for the campaign The company sat
about the long oak table on which a map was spread and Colonel Wade was
speaking when Wilding entered

On his appearance Wade ceased and every eye was turned upon the
messenger from London Ferguson fresh from his sermon sat with elbows
resting on the table his long chin supported by his hands his eyes
gleaming sharply under the shadow of his wig which was pulled down in
front to the level of his eyebrows

It was the Duke who addressed Mr Wilding and the latters keen ears
were quick to catch the bitterness that underlay his words

We are glad to see you sir we had not looked to do so again

Not looked to do so Your Gr Majesty he echoed plainly not
understanding and it was observed that he stumbled over the Dukes new
title

We had imagined that the pleasures of the town were claiming your
entire attention

Wilding looked from one to the other of the men before him and on the
face of all he saw a gravity that amounted to disapproval of him

The pleasures of the town said he frowning and againthe
pleasures of the town There is something in this that I fear I do not
understand

Do you bring us news that London has risen asked Grey suddenly

I would I could said Wilding smiling wistfully

Is it a laughing matter quoth Grey angrily

A smiling matter my lord answered Wilding nettled Your lordship
will observe that I did but smile

Mr Wilding said Monmouth darkly we are not pleased with you

In that case returned Wilding more and more irritated Your Majesty
expected of me more than was possible to any man

You have wasted your time in London sir the Duke explained We sent
you thither counting upon your loyalty and devotion to ourselves What
have you done

As much as a man could Wilding began when Grey again interrupted
him

As little as a man could he answered Were His Grace not the most
foolishly clement prince in Christendom a halter would be your reward
for the fine things you have done in London

Mr Wilding stiffened visibly his long white face grew set and his
slanting eyes looked wicked He was not a man readily moved to anger
but to be greeted in such words as these by one who constituted himself
the mouthpiece of him for whom Wilding had incurred ruin was more than
he could bear with equanimity that the risks to which he had exposed
himself in Londonwhere indeed he had been in almost hourly
expectation of arrest and such short shrift as poor Disney hadshould
be acknowledged in such terms as these was something that turned him
almost sick with disgust To what manner of men had he leagued himself
He looked Grey steadily between the eyes

I mind me of an occasion on which such a charge of foolish clemency
might indeedand with greater justicehave been levelled against His
Majesty said he and his calm was almost terrible

His lordship grew pale at the obvious allusion to Monmouths mild
treatment of him for his cowardice at Bridport and his eyes were as
baleful as Wildings own at that moment But before he could speak
Monmouth had already answered Mr Wilding

You are wanting in respect to us sir he admonished him

Mr Wilding bowed to the rebuke in a submission that seemed ironical
The blood mounted slowly to Monmouths cheeks

Perhaps put in Wade who was anxious for peace Mr Wilding has some
explanation to offer us of his failure

His failure They took too much for granted Stitched in the lining of
his boot was the letter from the Secretary of State To have achieved
that was surely to have achieved something

I thank you sir for supposing it answered Wilding his voice hard
with selfrestraint I have indeed an explanation

We will hear it said Monmouth condescendingly and Grey sneered
thrusting out his bloated lips

I have to offer the explanation that Your Majesty is served in London
by cowards selfsufficient and selfimportant cowards who have hindered
me in my task instead of helping me I refer particularly to Colonel
Danvers

Grey interrupted him You have a rare effrontery siraye by God Do
you dare call Danvers a coward

It is not I who so call him but the facts Colonel Danvers has run
away

Danvers gone cried Ferguson voicing the consternation of all

Wilding shrugged and smiled Greys eye was offensively upon him He
elected to answer the challenge of that glance He has followed
the illustrious example set him by other of Your Majestys devoted
followers said Wilding

Grey rose suddenly This was too much Ill not endure it from this
knave he cried appealing to Monmouth

Monmouth wearily waved him to a seat but Grey disregarded the command

What have I said that should touch your lordship asked Wilding and
smiling sardonically he looked into Greys eyes

It is not what you have said It is what you have inferred

And to call me knave said Wilding in a mocking horror

The repression of his anger lent him a rare bitterness and an almost
devilishly subtle manner of expressing wordlessly what was passing in
his mind There was not one present but gathered from his utterance of
those five words that he did not hold Grey worthy the honour of
being called to account for that offensive epithet He made just an
exclamatory protest such as he might have made had a woman applied the
term to him

Grey turned from him slowly to Monmouth It might be well said he
in his turn controlling himself at last to place Mr Wilding under
arrest

Mr Wildings manner quickened on the instant from passive to active
anger

Upon what charge sir he demanded sharply In truth it was the
only thing wanting that after all that he had undergone he should be
arrested His eyes were upon the Dukes melancholy face and his anger
was such that in that moment he vowed that if Monmouth acted upon this
suggestion of Greys he should not have so much as the consolation of
Sunderlands letter

You have been wanting in respect to us sir the Duke answered him
He seemed able to do little more than repeat himself You return from
London emptyhanded your task unaccomplished and instead of a becoming
contrition you hector it here before us in this manner He shook his
head We are not pleased with you Mr Wilding

But Your Grace exclaimed Wilding is it my fault that your London
agents had failed to organize the rising That rising should have taken
place and it would have taken place had Your Majesty been more ably
represented there

You were there Mr Wilding said Grey with heavy sarcasm

Would it no be better to leave Mr Wildings affair until afterwards
suggested Ferguson at that moment It is already past eight Your
Majesty and there be still some details of this attack to settle that
your officers may prepare for it whilst Mr Newlington awaits Your
Majesty to supper at nine

True said Monmouth ever ready to take a solution offered by another
We will confer with you again later Mr Wilding

Wilding bowed accepting his dismissal Before I go Your Majesty
there are certain things I would report he began

You have heard sir Grey broke in Not now This is not the time

Indeed no This is not the time Mr Wilding echoed the Duke

Wilding set his teeth in the intensity of his vexation

What I have to tell Your Majesty is of importance he exclaimed and
Monmouth seemed to waver whilst Grey looked disdainful unbelief of the
importance of any communication Wilding might have to make

We have little time Your Majesty Ferguson reminded Monmouth

Perhaps put in friendly Wade Your Majesty might see Mr Wilding at
Mr Newlingtons

Is it really necessary quoth Grey

This treatment of him inspired Mr Wilding with malice The mere mention
of Sunderlands letter would have changed their tone But he elected
by no such word to urge the importance of his business It should be
entirely as Monmouth should elect or be constrained by these gentlemen
about his counciltable

It would serve two purposes said Wade whilst Monmouth still
considered Your Majesty will be none too well attended your officers
having this other matter to prepare for Mr Wilding would form another
to swell your escort of gentlemen

I think you are right Colonel Wade said Monmouth We sup at Mr
Newlingtons at nine oclock Mr Wilding We shall expect you to attend
us there Lieutenant Cragg said His Grace to the young officer who had
admitted Wilding and who had remained at attention by the door you
may reconduct Mr Wilding

Wilding bowed his lips tight to keep in the anger that craved
expression Then without another word spoken he turned and departed

An insolent overbearing knave was Greys comment upon him after he
had left the room

Let us attend to this your lordship said Speke tapping the
map Time presses and he invited Wade to continue the matter that
Wildings advent had interrupted






CHAPTER XVIII BETRAYAL

Still smarting under the cavalier treatment he had received Mr Wilding
came forth from the Castle to find Trenchard awaiting him among the
crowd of officers and men that thronged the yard

Nick linked his arm through his friends and led him away They quitted
the place in silence and in silence took their way south towards the
High Street Nick waiting for Mr Wilding to speak Mr Wildings mind
still in turmoil at the things he had endured At last Nick halted
suddenly and looked keenly at his friend in the failing light

What a plague ails you Tony said he sharply You are as silent as I
am impatient for your news

Wilding told him in brief disdainful terms of the reception they
had given him at the Castle and of how they had blamed him for the
circumstance that London had failed to proclaim itself for Monmouth

Trenchard snarled viciously Tis that mongrel Grey said he Oh
Anthony to what an affair have we set our hands Naught can prosper
with that fellow in it He laid his hand on Wildings arm and lowered
his voice As I have hinted before twould not surprise me if time
proved him a traitor Failure attends him everywhere and so unfailingly
that one wonders is not failure invited by him And that fool Monmouth
Pshaw See what it is to serve a weakling With another in his place
and the country disaffected as it is we had been masters of England by
now

Two ladies passed them at that moment cloaked and hooded walking
briskly One of them turned to look at Trenchard who waving his arms
in wild gesticulation was a conspicuous object She checked in her
walk arresting her companion

Mr Wilding she exclaimed It was Lady Horton

Mr Wilding cried Diana her companion

Wilding doffed his hat and bowed Trenchard following his example

We had scarce looked to see you in Bridgwater again said the mother
her mild pleasant countenance reflecting the satisfaction it gave her
to behold him safe and sound

There have been moments answered Wilding when myself I scarce
expected to return Your ladyships greeting shows me what I had lost
had I not done so

You are but newly arrived quoth Diana scanning him in the gloaming

From London an hour since

An hour she echoed and observed that he was still booted and
duststained You will have been to Lupton House

A shadow crossed his face his glance seemed to grow clouded all of
which watchful Diana did not fail to observe Not yet said he

You are a laggard she laughed at him and he felt the blood driven
back upon his heart What did she mean Was it possible she suggested
that he should be welcome that his wifes feelings towards him had
undergone a change His last parting from her on the road near Walford
had been ever in his mind

I have had weighty business to transact he replied and Trenchard
snorted his mind flying back to the councilroom at the Castle and
what his friend had told him

But now that you have disposed of that you will sup with us said Lady
Horton who was convinced that since Ruth had gone to the altar with
him he was Ruths lover in spite of the odd things she had heard
Appearances with Lady Horton counted for everything and all that
glittered was gold to her

I would he answered but that I am to sup at Mr Newlingtons with
His Majesty My visit must wait until tomorrow

Let us hope said Trenchard that it waits no longer He was already
instructed touching the night attack on Fevershams camp on Sedgemoor
and thought it likely Wilding would accompany them

You are going to Mr Newlingtons said Diana and Trenchard thought
she had turned singularly pale Her hand was over her heart her eyes
wide She seemed about to add something but checked herself She took
her mothers arm We are detaining Mr Wilding mother said she
and her voice quivered as if her whole being were shaken by some gusty
agitation They spoke their farewells briefly and moved on A second
later Diana was back at their side again

Where are you lodged Mr Wilding she inquired

With my friend Trenchardat the sign of The Ship by the Cross

She briefly acknowledged the information rejoined her mother and
hurried away with her

Trenchard stood staring after them a moment Odd said he did you
mark that girls discomposure

But Wildings thoughts were elsewhere Come Nick If I am to render
myself fit to sit at table with Monmouth well need to hasten

They went their way but not so fast as went Diana urging with her her
protesting and shortwinded mother

Where is your mistress the girl asked excitedly of the first servant
she met at Lupton House

In her room madam the man replied and to Ruths room went Diana
breathlessly leaving Lady Horton gaping after her and understanding
nothing

Ruth who was seated pensive by her window rose on Dianas impetuous
entrance and in the deepening twilight she looked almost ghostly in her
gown of shimmering white satin sewn with pearls about the neck of the
lowcut bodice

Diana she cried You startled me

Not so much as I am yet to do answered Diana breathing excitement
She threw back the wimple from her head and pulling away her cloak
tossed it on to the bed Mr Wilding is in Bridgwater she announced

There was a faint rustle from the stiff satin of Ruths gown Then
her voice shook slightly Then he is not dead she said more
because she felt that she must say something than because her words
fitted the occasion

Not yet said Diana grimly

Not yet

He sups tonight at Mr Newlingtons Miss Horton exclaimed in a voice
pregnant with meaning

Ah It was a cry from Ruth sharp as if she had been stabbed She sank
back to her seat by the window smitten down by this sudden news

There was a pause which fretted Diana who now craved knowledge of what
might be passing in her cousins mind She advanced towards Ruth and
laid a trembling hand on her shoulder where the white gown met the
ivory neck He must be warned she said

But but how stammered Ruth To warn him were to betray Sir
Rowland

Sir Rowland cried Diana in high scorn

And and Richard Ruth continued

Yes and Mr Newlington and all the other knaves that are engaged in
this murderous business Well she demanded Will you do it or must
I

Do it Ruths eyes sought her cousins white excited face in the
quasidarkness But have you thought of what it will mean Have you
thought of the poor people that will perish unless the Duke is taken and
this rebellion brought to an end

Thought of it repeated Diana witheringly Not I I have thought that
Mr Wilding is here and like to have his throat cut before an hour is
past

Tell me are you sure of this asked Ruth

I have it from your husbands own lips Diana answered and told her
in a few words of her meeting with Mr Wilding

Ruth sat with hands folded in her lap her eyes on the dim violet
afterglow in the west and her mind wrestling with this problem that
Diana had brought her

Diana she cried at last what am I to do

Do echoed Diana Is it not plain Warn Mr Wilding

But Richard

Mr Wilding saved Richards life

I know I know My duty is to warn him

Then why hesitate

My duty is also to keep faith with Richard to think of those poor
misguided folk who are to be saved by this cried Ruth in an agony If
Mr Wilding is warned they will all be ruined

Diana stamped her foot impatiently Had I thought to find you in this
mind I had warned him myself said she

Ah Why did you not

That the chance of doing so might be yours That you might thus repay
him the debt in which you stand

Diana I cant The words broke from her in a sob

But whatever her interest in Mr Wilding for her own sake Dianas prime
intent was the thwarting of Sir Rowland Blake If Wilding were warned
of what manner of feast was spread at Newlingtons Sir Rowland would be
indeed undone

You think of Richard she exclaimed and you know that Richard is to
have no active part in the affairthat he will run no risk They have
assigned him but a sentry duty that he may warn Blake and his followers
if any danger threatens them

It is not of Richards life I am thinking but of his honour of his
trust in me To warn Mr Wilding were to commit an act of betrayal

And is Mr Wilding to be slaughtered with his friends Diana asked
her Resolve me that Time presses In half an hour it will be too
late

That allusion to the shortness of the time brought Ruth an inspiration
Suddenly she saw a way Wilding should be saved and yet she would not
break faith with Richard nor ruin those others She would detain him
and whilst warning him at the last moment in time for him to save
himself not do so until it must be too late for him to warn the others
Thus she would do her duty by him and yet keep faith with Richard and
Sir Rowland She had resolved she thought the awful difficulty that
had confronted her She rose suddenly heartened by the thought

Give me your cloak and wimple she bade Diana and Diana flew to do
her bidding Where is Mr Wilding lodged she asked

At the sign of The Shipoverlooking the Cross with Mr Trenchard
Shall I come with you

No answered Ruth without hesitation I will go alone She drew the
wimple well over her head so that in its shadows her face might lie
concealed and hid her shimmering white dress under Dianas cloak

She hastened through the illlighted streets never heeding the rough
cobbles that hurt her feet shod in light indoor wear never heeding the
crowds that thronged her way All Bridgwater was astir with Monmouths
presence moreover there had been great incursions from Taunton and the
surrounding country the womenfolk of the DukeKings followers having
come that day to Bridgwater to say farewell to father and son husband
and brother before the army marchedas was still believedto
Gloucester

The halfhour was striking from Saint Marysthe church in which she
had been marriedas Ruth reached the door of the sign of The Ship She
was about to knock when suddenly it opened and Mr Wilding himself
with Trenchard immediately behind him stood confronting her At sight
of him a momentary weakness took her He had changed from his hardused
ridinggarments into a suit of roughly corded black silk which threw
into relief the steely litheness of his spare figure His dark brown
hair was carefully dressed diamonds gleamed in the cravat of snowy lace
at his throat He was uncovered his hat under his arm and he stood
aside to make way for her imagining that she was some woman of the
house

Mr Wilding said she her heart fluttering in her throat May I
may I speak with you

He leaned forward seeking to pierce the shadows of her wimple he had
thought he recognized the voice as his sudden start had shown and
yet he disbelieved his ears She moved her head at that moment and the
light streaming out from a lamp in the passage beat upon her white face

Ruth he cried and came quickly forward Trenchard behind
him looked on and scowled with sudden impatience Mr Wildings
philanderings with this lady had never had the old rakes approval Too
much trouble already had resulted from them

I must speak with you at once At once she urged him her tone
fearful

Are you in need of me he asked concernedly

In very urgent need said she

I thank God he answered without flippancy You shall find me at your
service Tell me

Not here not here she answered him

Where else said he Shall we walk

No no Her repetitions marked the deep excitement that possessed her
I will go in with you And she signed with her head towards the door
from which he was barely emerged

Twere scarce fitting said he for being confused and full of
speculation on the score of her need he had for the moment almost
overlooked the relations in which they stood In spite of the ceremony
through which they had gone together Mr Wilding still mostly thought
of her as of a mistress very difficult to woo

Fitting she echoed and then after a pause Am I not your wife she
asked him in a low voice her cheeks crimsoning

Ha Pon honour I had almost forgot said he and though the burden
of his words seemed mocking their tone was sad

Of the passersby that jostled them a couple had now paused to watch a
scene that had an element of the unusual in it She pulled her wimple
closer to her face took him by the arm and drew him with her into the
house

Close the door she bade him and Trenchard who had stood aside that
they might pass in forestalled him in obeying her Now lead me to your
room said she and Wilding in amaze turned to Trenchard as if asking
his consent for the lodging after all was Trenchards

Ill wait here said Nick and waved his hand towards an oak bench
that stood in the passage You had best make haste he urged his
friend you are late already That is unless you are of a mind to set
the ladys affairs before King Monmouths And were I in your place
Anthony faith Id not scruple to do it For after all he added under
his breath theres little choice in rotten apples

Ruth waited for some answer from Wilding that might suggest he was
indifferent whether he went to Newlingtons or not but he spoke no word
as he turned to lead the way abovestairs to the indifferent
parlour which with the adjoining bedroom constituted Mr Trenchards
lodgingand his own for the time being

Having assured herself that the curtains were closely drawn she put by
her cloak and hood and stood revealed to him in the light of the
three candles burning in a branch upon the bare oak table dazzlingly
beautiful in her gown of ivorywhite

He stood apart cogitating her with glowing eyes the faintest smile
between question and pleasure hovering about his thin mouth He had
closed the door and stood in silence waiting for her to make known to
him her pleasure

Mr Wilding she began and straightway he interrupted her

But a moment since you did remind me that I have the honour to be your
husband he said with grave humour Why seek now to overcloud that
fact I mind me that the last time we met you called me by another name
But it may be he added as an afterthought you are of opinion that I
have broken faith with you

Broken faith As how

So he said and sighed My words were of so little account that they
have been I see forgotten Yet so that I remember them that is what
chiefly matters I promised thenor seemed to promisethat I would
make a widow of you who had made a wife of you against your will It
has not happened yet Do not despair This Monmouth quarrel is not yet
fought out Hope on my Ruth

She looked at him with eyes wide openlustrous eyes of sapphire in
a face of ivory A faint smile parted her lips the reflection of the
thought in her mind that had she indeed been eager for his death she
would not be with him at this moment had she desired it how easy would
her course have been

You do me wrong to bid me hope for that she answered him her tones
level I do not wish the death of any man unless She paused her
truthfulness urged her too far

Unless said he brows raised polite interest on his face

Unless it be His Grace of Monmouth

He considered her with suddenly narrowed eyes You have not by chance
sought me to talk politics said he Or and he suddenly caught his
breath his nostrils dilating with rage at the bare thought that leapt
into his mind Had Monmouth the notorious libertine been to Lupton
House and persecuted her with his addresses Is it that you are
acquainted with His Grace he asked

I have never spoken to him she answered with no suspicion of what
was in his thoughts

In his relief he laughed remembering now that Monmouths affairs were
too absorbing just at present to leave him room for dalliance

But you are standing said he and he advanced a chair I deplore
that I have no better hospitality to offer you I doubt if I ever shall
again I am told that Albemarle did me the honour to stable his knackers
in my hall at Zoyland

She took the chair he offered her sinking to it like one physically
weary a thing he was quick to notice He watched her his body eager
his soul trammelling it with a steely restraint Tell me now said
he in what you need me

She was silent a moment pondering hesitation and confusion seeming to
envelop her A pink flush rose to colour the beautiful pillar of neck
and overspread the delicate halfaverted face He watched it wondering

How long she asked him her whole intent at present being to delay
him and gain time How long have you been in Bridgwater

Two hours at most said he

Two hours And yet you never came to to me I heard of your
presence and I feared you might intend to abstain from seeking me

He almost held his breath while she spoke caught in amazement He was
standing close beside her chair his right hand rested upon its tall
back

Did you so intend she asked him

I told you even now he answered with hardwon calm that I had made
you a sort of promise

I I would not have you keep it she murmured She heard his sharply
indrawn breath felt him leaning over her and was filled with an
unaccountable fear

Was it to tell me this you came he asked her his voice reduced to a
whisper

No yes she answered an agony in her mind which groped for some
means to keep him by her side until his danger should be overpast That
much she owed him in honour if in nothing else

Noyes he echoed and he had drawn himself erect again What ist
you mean Ruth

I mean that it was that yet not quite only that

Ah Disappointment vibrated faintly in his clamation What else

I would have you abandon Monmouths following she told him

He stared a moment moved away and round where he could confront her
The flush had now faded from her face This he observed and the heave
of her bosom in its low bodice He knit his brows perplexed Here was
surely more than at first might seem

Why so he asked

For your own safetys sake she answered him

You are oddly concerned for that Ruth

Concernednot oddly She paused an instant swallowed hard and then
continued I am concerned too for your honour and there is no honour
in following his banner He has crowned himself King and so proved
himself a selfseeker who came dissembled as the champion of a cause
that he might delude poor ignorant folk into flocking to his standard
and helping him to his ambitious ends

You are wondrously well schooled said he Whose teachings do you
recite me Sir Rowland Blakes

At another time the sneer might have cut her At the moment she was too
intent upon gaining time The means to it mattered little The more she
talked to no purpose the more at random was their discourse the better
would her ends be served

Sir Rowland Blake she cried What is he to me

Ah what Let me set you the question rather

Less than nothing she assured him and for some moments afterwards it
was this Sir Rowland who served them as a topic for their odd interview
On the overmantel the pulse of time beat on from a little wooden clock
His eyes strayed to it it marked the threequarters He bethought
him suddenly of his engagement Trenchard belowstairs supremely
indifferent whether Wilding went to Newlingtons or not smoked on
entirely unconcerned by the flight of time

Mistress said Wilding suddenly you have not yet told me in what you
seek my service Indeed we seem to have talked to little purpose My
time is very short

Where are you going she asked him and fearfully she shot a sidelong
glance at the timepiece It was still too soon by at least five
minutes

He smiled but his smile was singular He began to suspect at last that
her only purposeto what end he could not guesswas to detain him

Tis a singularly sudden interest in my doings this said he quietly
What ist you seek of me He reached for the hat he had cast upon the
table when they had entered Tell me briefly I may stay no longer

She rose her agitation suddenly increasing afraid that after all he
would escape her Where are you going she asked Answer me that and
I will tell you why I came

I am to sup at Mr Newlingtons in His Majestys company

His Majestys

King Monmouths he explained impatiently Come Ruth Already I am
late

If I were to ask you not to go she said slowly and she held out her
hands to him her glance most piteousand that was not actingas she
raised it to meet his own would you not stay to pleasure me

He considered her from under frowning eyes Ruth he said and he took
her hands there is here something that I do not understand What ist
you mean

Promise me that you will not go to Newlingtons and I will tell you

But what has Newlington to do with Nay I am pledged already to
go

She drew closer to him her hands upon his shoulders Yet if I ask
youI your wife she pleaded and almost won him to her will

But suddenly he remembered another occasion on which for purposes of
her own she had so pleaded He laughed softly mockingly

Do you woo me Ruth who when I wooed you would have none of me

She drew back from him crimsoning I think I had better go said she
You have nothing but mockery for me It was ever so Who knows she
sighed as she took up her mantle Had you but observed more gentle
ways you you She paused needing to say no more Goodnight
she ended and made shift to leave He watched her deeply mystified
She had gained the door when suddenly he moved

Wait he cried She paused and turned to look over her shoulder her
hand apparently upon the latch You shall not go until you have told
me why you besought me to keep away from Newlingtons What is it he
asked and paused suddenly a flood of light breaking in upon his mind
Is there some treachery afoot he asked her and his eye went wildly
to the clock A harsh grating sound rang through the room What are
you doing he cried Why have you locked the door She was tugging
and fumbling desperately to extract the key her hands all clumsy in her
nervous haste He leapt at her but in that moment the key came away in
her hand She wheeled round to face him erect defiant almost

Here is some devilry he cried Give me that key

He had no need for further questions Here was a proof more eloquent
than words to his ready wit Sir Rowland or Richard or both were in
some plot for the Dukes ruinperhaps assassination Had not her very
words shown that she herself was out of all sympathy with Monmouth He
was out of sympathy himself But not to the extent of standing by to see
his throat cut She would have the plot succeedwhatever it might be
and yet that he himself be spared There his thoughts paused but only
for a moment He saw suddenly in this not a proof of concern born of
love but of duty towards him who had imperilled himself onceand for
all time indeedthat he might save her brother and Sir Rowland

He told her what had been so suddenly revealed to him taxing her with
it She acknowledged it her wits battling to find some way by which
she might yet gain a few moments more She would cling to the key and
though he should offer her violence she would not let it go without a
struggle and that struggle must consume the little time yet wanting to
make it too late for him to save the Duke andwhat imported morethus
save herself from betraying her brothers trust Another fear leapt at
her suddenly If through deed of hers Monmouth was spared that night
Blake in his despair and rage might slake his vengeance upon Richard

Give me that key he demanded his voice cold and quiet his face set

No no she cried setting her hand behind her You shall not go
Anthony You shall not go

I must he insisted still cold but oh so determined My honours
in it now that I know

Youll go to your death she reminded him

He sneered What signifies a day or so Give me the key

I love you Anthony she cried livid to the lips

Lies he answered her contemptuously The key

No she answered and her firmness matched his own I will not have
you slain

Tis not my purposenot just yet But I must save the others God
forgive me if I offer violence to a woman he added and lay rude
hands upon her Do not compel me to it He advanced upon her but she
lithe and quick evaded him and sprang for the middle of the room He
wheeled about his selfcontrol all slipping from him now Suddenly she
darted to the window and with the hand that clenched the key she
smote a pane with all her might There was a smash of shivering glass
followed an instant later by a faint tinkle on the stones below and the
hand that she still held out covered itself all with blood

O God he cried the key and all else forgotten You are hurt

But you are saved she cried overwrought and staggered laughing and
sobbing to a chair sinking her bleeding hand to her lap and smearing
recklessly her spotless shimmering gown

He caught up a chair by its legs and at a single blow smashed down the
doora frail barrier after all Nick he roared Nick He tossed
the chair from him and vanished into the adjoining room to reappear a
moment later carrying basin and ewer and a shirt of Trenchardsthe
first piece of linen he could find

She was half fainting and she let him have his swift masterful way
He bathed her hand and was relieved to find that the injury was none so
great as the flow of blood had made him fear He tore Trenchards
fine cambric shirt to shredsa matter on which Trenchard afterwards
commented in quotations from at least three famous Elizabethan
dramatists He bound up her hand just as Nick made his appearance at
the splintered door his mouth open his pipe gone out between his
fingers He was followed by a startled servingwench the only other
person in the house for every one was out of doors that night

Into the womans care Wilding delivered his wife and without a word to
her he left the room dragging Trenchard with him It was striking nine
as they went down the stairs and the sound brought as much satisfaction
to Ruth above as dismay to Wilding below






CHAPTER XIX THE BANQUET

It was striking nine Therefore Ruth thought that she had achieved her
object Wilding imagined that all was lost It needed the more tranquil
mind of Nicholas Trenchard to show him the fly in madams ointment
after Wilding in half a dozen words had made him acquainted with the
situation

What are you going to do asked Trenchard

Run to Newlingtons and warn the Dukeif still in time

And thereby precipitate the catastrophe Oh give it thought It is all
it needs You are taking it for granted that nine oclock is the hour
appointed for King Monmouths butchery

What else asked Wilding impatient to be off

They were standing in the street under the sign of The Ship by which
Jonathan EdneyMr Trenchards landlorddistinguished his premises and
the chandlers trade he drove there Trenchard set a detaining hand on
Mr Wildings arm

Nine oclock is the hour appointed for supper It is odds the Duke will
be a little late and it is more than odds that when he does arrive the
assassins will wait until the company is safely at table and lulled by
good eating and drinking You had overlooked that I see It asks an old
head for wisdom after all Look you Anthony Speed to Colonel Wade as
fast as your legs can carry you and get a score of men Then find
some fellow to lead you to Newlingtons orchard and if only you do not
arrive too late you may take Sir Rowland and his cutthroats in the rear
and destroy them to a man before they realize themselves attacked Ill
reconnoitre while you go and keep an eye on the front of the house
Away with you

Ordinarily Wilding was a man of a certain dignity but you had not
thought it had you seen him running in silk stockings and silverbuckled
shoes at a headlong pace through the narrow streets of Bridgwater
in the direction of the Castle He overset more than one and oaths
followed him from these and from others whom he rudely jostled out of
his path Wade was gone with Monmouth but he came upon Captain Slape
who had a company of scythes and musketeers incorporated in the Dukes
own regiment and to him Wilding gasped out the news and his request for
a score of men with what breath was left him

Time was lostand never was time more preciousin convincing Slape
that this was no old wifes tale At last however he won his way and
twenty musketeers but the quarterpast the hour had chimed ere they
left the Castle He led them forth at a sharp run with never a thought
for the circumstance that they would need their breath anon perhaps for
fighting and he bade the man who guided them take them by back streets
that they might attract as little attention as possible

Within a stonesthrow of the house he halted them and sent one
forward to reconnoitre following himself with the others as quietly and
noiselessly as possible Mr Newlingtons house was all alight but from
the absence of uproarsounds there were in plenty from the main street
where a dense throng had collected to see His Majesty go inMr Wilding
inferred with supreme relief that they were still in time But
the danger was not yet past Already perhaps the assassins were
penetratingor had penetratedto the house and at any moment such
sounds might greet them as would announce the execution of their
murderous design

Meanwhile Mr Trenchard having relighted his pipe and set his hat
rakishly atop his golden wig strolled up the High Street swinging
his long cane very much like a gentleman taking the air in quest of an
appetite for supper He strolled past the Cross and on until he came
to the handsome mansionone of the few handsome houses in
Bridgwaterwhere opulent Mr Newlington had his residence A small
crowd had congregated about the doors for word had gone forth that His
Majesty was to sup there Trenchard moved slowly through the people
seemingly uninterested but in fact scanning closely every face he
encountered Suddenly out of the corner of his eye he espied in the
indifferent light Mr Richard Westmacott

Trenchard passed him jostling him as he went and strolled on some few
paces then turned and came slowly back and observed that Richard had
also turned and was now watching him as he approached He was all but
upon the boy when suddenly his wrinkled face lighted with recognition

Mr Westmacott he cried and there was surprise in his voice

Richard conscious that Trenchard must no doubt regard him as a
turntippet flushed and stood aside to give passage to the other
But Mr Trenchard was by no means minded to pass He clapped a hand
on Richards shoulder Nay he cried between laughter and feigned
resentment Do you bear me illwill lad

Richard was somewhat taken aback For what should I bear you illwill
Mr Trenchard quoth he

Trenchard laughed frankly and so uproariously that his hat
overjauntily cocked was all but shaken from his head I mind me the
last time we met I played you an unfair trick said he His tone
bespoke the very highest goodhumour He slipped his arm through
Richards Never bear an old man malice lad said he

I assure you that I bear you none said Richard relieved to find that
Trenchard apparently knew nothing of his defection yet wishing that
Trenchard would go his ways for Richards task was to stand sentry
there

Ill not believe you till you afford me proof Trenchard replied You
shall come and wash your resentment down in the best bottle of Canary
the White Cow can furnish us

Not now I thank you answered Richard

You are thinking of the last occasion on which I drank with you said
Trenchard reproachfully

Not so But but I am not thirsty

Not thirsty echoed Trenchard And is that a reason Why lad it is
the beast that drinks only when he thirsts And in that lies one of the
main differences between beast and man Come onand his arm effected a
gentle pressure upon Richards to move him thence But at that moment
down the street with a great rumble of wheels cracking of whips
and clatter of hoofs came a coach bearing to Mr Newlingtons King
Monmouth escorted by his forty lifeguards Cheering broke from the
crowd as the carriage drew up and the DukeKing as he alighted
turned his handsome face on which shone the ruddy glow of torches to
acknowledge these loyal acclamations He passed up the steps at the top
of which Mr Newlingtonfat and pale and monstrously overdressedstood
bowing to welcome his royal visitor Host and guest vanished followed
by some six officers of Monmouths among whom were Grey and Wade
The sightseers flattened themselves against the walls as the great
lumbering coach put about and went off again the way it had come the
lifeguards following after

Trenchard fancied that he caught a sigh of relief from Richard but the
street was noisy at the time and he may well have been mistaken

Come said he renewing his invitation we shall both be the better
for a little milk of the White Cow

Richard wavered almost by instinct The White Cow he knew was famous
for its sack on the other hand he was pledged to Sir Rowland to
stand guard in the narrow lane at the back where ran the wall of Mr
Newlingtons garden Under the gentle suasion of Trenchards arm he
moved a few steps up the street then halted his duty battling with his
inclination

No no he muttered If you will excuse me

Not I said Trenchard drawing from his hesitation a shrewd inference
as to Richards business To drink alone is an abomination Ill not be
guilty of

But began the irresolute Richard

Shalt urge me no excuses or well quarrel Come and he moved on
dragging Richard with him

A few steps Richard took unwillingly under the others soft compulsion
then having given the matter thoughthe was always one to take the
line of least resistancehe assured himself that his sentryship was
entirely superfluous the matter of Blakes affair was an entire secret
shared only by those who had a hand in it Blake was quite safe from all
surprises Trenchard was insistent and it was difficult to deny him
and the sack at the White Cow was no doubt the best in Somerset He gave
himself up to the inevitable and fell into step alongside his companion
who babbled aimlessly of trivial matters Trenchard felt the change from
unwilling to willing companionship and approved it

They mounted the three steps and entered the common room of the inn
It was well thronged at the time but they found places at the end of a
long table and there they sat and discussed the landladys Canary for
the best part of a halfhour until a sudden spatter of musketry near
at hand came to startle the whole room

There was a momentary stillness in the tavern succeeded by an excited
clamouring a dash for the windows and a storm of questions to
which none could return any answer Richard had risen with a sudden
exclamation very pale and scared of aspect Trenchard tugged at his
sleeve

Sit down said he Sit down It will be nothing

Nothing echoed Richard and his eyes were suddenly bent on Trenchard
in a look in which suspicion was now blent with terror

A second volley of musketry crackled forth at that moment and the next
the whole street was in an uproar Men were running and shots resounded
on every side above all of which predominated the cry that His Majesty
was murdered

In an instant the common room of the White Cow was emptied of every
occupant save twoTrenchard and Westmacott Neither of them felt the
need to go forth in quest of news They knew how idle was the cry in
the streets They knew what had taken place and knowing it Trenchard
smoked on placidly satisfied that Wilding had been in time whilst
Richard stood stricken and petrified by dismay at realizing with even
greater certainty that something had supervened to thwart perhaps
to destroy Sir Rowland For he knew that Blakes party had gone forth
armed with pistols only and intent not to use even these save in
the last extremity to avoid noise they were to keep to steel This
knowledge gave Richard positive assurance that the volleys they had
heard must have been fired by some party that had fallen upon Blakes
men and taken them by surprise

And it was his fault He was the traitor to whom perhaps a score of men
owed their deaths at that moment He had failed to keep watch as he had
undertaken His fault it wasNo not his but this villains who sat
there smugly taking his ease and pulling at his pipe

At a blow Richard dashed the thing from his companions mouth and
fingers

Trenchard looked up startled

What the devil he began

It is your fault your fault cried Richard his eyes blazing his
lips livid It was you who lured me hither

Trenchard stared at him in bland surprise Now what a plague ist
youre saying he asked and brought Richard to his senses by awaking
in him the instinct of selfpreservation

How could he explain his meaning without betraying himselfand surely
that were a folly now that the others were no doubt disposed of Let
him rather bethink him of his own safety Trenchard looked at him
keenly with wellassumed intent to read what might be passing in his
mind then rose paid for the wine and expressed his intention of
going forth to inquire into these strange matters that were happening in
Bridgwater

Meanwhile those volleys fired in Mr Newlingtons orchard had
causedas well may be conceivedan agitated interruption of the superb
feast Mr Newlington had spread for his noble and distinguished guests
The Duke had for some days been going in fear of his life for already
he had been fired at more than once by men anxious to earn the price
at which his head was valued instantly he surmised that whatever that
firing might mean it indicated some attempt to surprise him with the
few gentlemen who attended him

The whole company came instantly to its feet and Colonel Wade stepped
to a window that stood openfor the night was very warm The Duke
turned for explanation to his host the trader however professed
himself entirely unable to offer any He was very pale and his limbs
were visibly trembling but then his agitation was most natural His
wife and daughter supervened at that moment in their alarm entering the
room unceremoniously in spite of the august presence to inquire into
the meaning of this firing and to reassure themselves that their father
and his illustrious guests were safe

From the windows they could observe a stir in the gardens below Black
shadows of men flitted to and fro and a loud rich voice was heard
calling to them to take cover that they were betrayed Then a sheet of
livid flame blazed along the summit of the low wall and a second volley
of musketry rang out succeeded by cries and screams from the assailed
and the shouts of the assailers who were now pouring into the garden
through the battered doorway and over the wall For some moments
steel rang on steel and pistolshots cracked here and there to the
accompaniment of voices raised some in anger some in pain But it was
soon over and a comparative stillness succeeded

A voice called up from the darkness under the windows to know if His
Majesty was safe There had been a plot to take him but the ambuscaders
had been ambuscaded in their turn and not a man of them remainedwhich
was hardly exact for under a laurel bush scarce daring to breathe lay
Sir Rowland Blake livid with fear and fury and bleeding from a rapier
scratch in the cheek but otherwise unhurt

In the room above Monmouth had sunk wearily into his chair upon hearing
of the design there had been against his life A deep bitter melancholy
enwrapped his spirit Lord Greys first thoughts flew to the man he
most dislikedthe one man missing from those who had been bidden to
accompany His Majesty whose absence had already formed the subject
of comment Grey remembered this bearing before the council that same
evening and his undisguised resentment of the reproaches levelled
against him

Where is Mr Wilding he asked suddenly his voice dominating the
din of talk that filled the room Do we hold the explanation of his
absence

Monmouth looked up quickly his beautiful eyes ineffably sad his weak
mouth drooping at the corners Wade turned to confront Grey

Your lordship does not suggest that Mr Wilding can have a hand in
this

Appearances would seem to point in that direction answered Grey and
in his wicked heart he almost hoped it might be so

Then appearances speak truth for once came a bitter ringing voice
They turned and there on the threshold stood Mr Wilding Unheard he
had come upon them He was bareheaded and carried his drawn sword There
was blood upon it and there was blood on the lace that half concealed
the hand that held it otherwiseand saving that his shoes and
stockings were sodden with the dew from the long grass in the
orchardhe was as spotless as when he had left Ruth in Trenchards
lodging his face too was calm save for the mocking smile with which
he eyed Lord Grey

Monmouth rose on his appearance and put his hand to his sword in alarm
Grey whipped his own from the scabbard and placed himself slightly in
front of his master as if to preserve him

You mistake sirs said Wilding quietly The hand I have had in this
affair has been to save Your Majesty from your enemies At the moment I
should have joined you word was brought me of the plot that was laid
of the trap that was set for you I hastened to the Castle and obtained
a score of musketeers of Slapes company With those I surprised the
murderers lurking in the garden there and made an end of them I
greatly feared I should not come in time but it is plain that Heaven
preserves Your Majesty for better days

In the revulsion of feeling Monmouths eyes shone moist Grey sheathed
his sword with an awkward laugh and a still more awkward word of
apology to Wilding The Duke moved by a sudden impulse to make amends
for his unworthy suspicions for his perhaps unworthy reception of
Wilding earlier that evening in the councilroom drew the sword on
which his hand still rested He advanced a step

Kneel Mr Wilding he said in a voice stirred by emotion But
Wildings stern spirit scorned this all too sudden friendliness of
Monmouths as much as he scorned the accolade at Monmouths hands

There are more pressing matters to demand Your Majestys attention
said Mr Wilding coldly advancing to the table as he spoke and taking
up a napkin to wipe his blade than the reward of an unworthy servant

Monmouth felt his sudden enthusiasm chilled by that tone and manner

Mr Newlington said Mr Wilding after the briefest of pauses and
the fat sinful merchant started forward in alarm It was like a summons
of doom His Majesty came hither I am informed to receive at your
hands a sum of moneytwenty thousand poundstowards the expenses
of the campaign Have you the money at hand And his eye glittering
between cruelty and mockery fixed itself upon the merchants ashen
face

It it shall be forthcoming by morning stammered Newlington

By morning cried Grey who with the others watched Mr Newlington
what time they all wondered at Mr Wildings question and the manner of
it

You knew that I march tonight Monmouth reproached the merchant

And it was to receive the money that you invited His Majesty to do you
the honours of supping with you here put in Wade frowning darkly

The merchants wife and daughter stood beside him watching him and
plainly uneasy Before he could make any reply Mr Wilding spoke again

The circumstance that he has not the money by him is a little oddor
would be were it not for what has happened I would submit Your
Majesty that you receive from Mr Newlington not twenty thousand pounds
as he had promised you but thirty thousand and that you receive it not
as a loan as was proposed but as a fine imposed upon him in consequence
of his lack of care in the matter of his orchard

Monmouth looked at the merchant very sternly You have heard Mr
Wildings suggestion said he You may thank the god of traitors it
was made else we might have thought of a harsher course You shall pay
the money by ten oclock tomorrow to Mr Wilding whom I shall leave
behind for the sole purpose of collecting it He turned from Newlington
in plain disgust I think sirs that here is no more to be done Are
the streets safe Mr Wilding

Not only safe Your Majesty but the twenty men of Slapes and your own
lifeguards are waiting to escort you

Then in Gods name let us be going said Monmouth sheathing his sword
and moving towards the door Not a second time did he offer to confer
the honour of knighthood upon his saviour

Mr Wilding turned and went out to marshal his men The Duke and his
officers followed more leisurely As they reached the door a womans
cry broke the silence behind them Monmouth turned Mr Newlington
purple of face and his eyes protruding horridly was beating the air
with his hands Suddenly he collapsed and crashed forward with arms
flung out amid the glass and silver of the table all spread with the
traitors banquet to which he had bidden his unsuspecting victim

His wife and daughter ran to him and called him by name Monmouth
pausing a moment to watch them from the doorway with eyes unmoved But
Mr Newlington answered not their call for he was dead






CHAPTER XX THE RECKONING

Ruth had sped home through the streets unattended as she had come
heedless of the rude jostlings and ruder greetings she met with from
those she passed heedless too of the smarting of her injured hand
for the agony of her soul was such that it whelmed all minor sufferings
of the flesh

In the diningroom at Lupton House she came upon Diana and Lady Horton
at supper and her appearanceher white and distraught face and
bloodsmeared gownbrought both women to their feet in alarmed inquiry
no less than it brought Jasper the butler to her side with ready
solicitude Ruth answered him that there was no cause for fear that she
was quite wellhad scratched her hand no more and with that dismissed
him When she was alone with her aunt and cousin she sank into a chair
and told them what had passed twixt her husband and herself and most of
what she said was Greek to Lady Horton

Mr Wilding has gone to warn the Duke she ended and the despair of
her tone was tragical I sought to detain him until it should be too
lateI thought I had done so but but Oh I am afraid Diana

Afraid of what asked Diana Afraid of what

And she came to Ruth and set an arm in comfort about her shoulders

Afraid that Mr Wilding might reach the Duke in time to be destroyed
with him her cousin answered Such a warning could but hasten on the
blow

Lady Horton begged to be enlightened and was filled with horror
whenfrom Dianaenlightenment was hers Her sympathies were all with
the handsome Monmouth for he was beautiful and should therefore be
triumphant poor Lady Horton never got beyond externals That her
nephew and Sir Rowland whom she had esteemed should be leagued in this
dastardly undertaking against that lovely person horrified her beyond
words She withdrew soon afterwards having warmly praised Ruths action
in warning Mr Wildingunable to understand that it should be no part
of Ruths design to save the Dukeand went to her room to pray for the
preservation of the late Kings handsome son

Left alone with her cousin Ruth gave expression to the fears for
Richard by which she was being tortured Diana poured wine for her
and urged her to drink she sought to comfort and reassure her But
as moments passed and grew to hours and still Richard did not appear
Ruths fears that he had come to harm were changed to certainty There
was a moment when but for Dianas remonstrances she had gone forth in
quest of news Bad news were better than this horror of suspense What
if Wildings warning should have procured help and Richard were slain
in consequence Oh it was unthinkable Diana white of face listened
to and shared her fears Even her shallow nature was stirred by the
tragedy of Ruths position by dread lest Richard should indeed have met
his end that night In these moments of distress she forgot her hopes
of triumphing over Blake of punishing him for his indifference to
herself

At last at something after midnight there came a fevered rapping at
the outer door Both women started up and with arms about each other
in their sudden panic stood there waiting for the news that must be
here at last

The door of the diningroom was flung open the women recoiled in
their dread of what might come then Richard entered Jaspers startled
countenance showing behind him

He closed the door shutting out the wondering servant and they saw
that though his face was ashen and his limbs all atremble he showed
no sign of any hurt or effort His dress was as meticulous as when last
they had seen him Ruth flew to him flung her arms about his neck and
pressed him to her

Oh Richard Richard she sobbed in the immensity of her relief
Thank God Thank God

He wriggled peevishly in her embrace disengaged her arms and put her
from him almost roughly Have done he growled and lurching past
her he reached the table took up a bottle and brimmed himself a
measure He gulped the wine avidly set down the cup and shivered
Where is Blake he asked

Blake echoed Ruth her lips white Diana sank into a chair
watchful fearful and silent taking now no glory in the thing she had
encompassed

Richard beat his hands together in a passion of dismay Is he not
here he asked and groaned O God He flung himself all limp into a
chair You have heard the news I see he said

Not all of it said Diana hoarsely leaning forward Tell us what
passed

He moistened his lips with his tongue We were betrayed he said in a
quivering voice Betrayed Did I but know by whom He broke off with
a bitter laugh and shrugged rubbing his hands together and shivering
till his shoulders shook Blakes party was set upon by half a company
of musketeers Their corpses are strewn about old Newlingtons orchard
Not one of them escaped They say that Newlington himself is dead He
poured himself more wine

Ruth listened her eyes burning the rest of her as cold as ice
Butbut oh thank God that you at least are safe Dick

How did you escape quoth Diana

How He started as if he had been stung He laughed in a high cracked
voice his eyes wild and bloodshot How Perhaps it is just as well
that Blake has gone to his account Perhaps He checked on the word
and started to his feet Diana screamed in sheer affright Behind her
the windows had been thrust open so violently that one of the panes was
shivered Blake stood under the lintel scarce recognizable so smeared
was his face with the blood escaping from the wound his cheek had taken
His clothes were muddied soiled torn and disordered

Framed there against the black background of the night he stood and
surveyed them for a moment his aspect terrific Then he leapt forward
baring his sword as he came An incoherent roar burst from his lips as
he bore straight down upon Richard

You damned infernal traitor he cried Draw draw Or die like the
muckworm that you are

Intrepid her terror all vanished now that there was the need for
courage Ruth confronted him barring his passage a buckler to her
palsied brother

Out of my way mistress or Ill be doing you a mischief

You are mad Sir Rowland she told him in a voice that did something
towards restoring him to his senses

His fierce eyes considered her a moment and he controlled himself to
offer an explanation The twenty that were with me lie stark under
the stars in Newlingtons garden he told her as Richard had told her
already I escaped by a miracle no less but for what Feversham will
demand of me a stern account of those lives whilst if I am found in
Bridgwater there will be a short shrift for me at the rebel handsfor
my share in this affair is known my name on every lip in the town And
why he asked with a sudden increase of fierceness Why Because that
craven villain there betrayed me

He did not she answered in so assured a voice that not only did it
give him pause but caused Richard cowering behind her to raise his
head in wonder

Sir Rowland smiled his disbelief and that smile twisting his
bloodsmeared countenance was grotesque and horrible I left him to
guard our backs and give me warning if any approached he informed her
I knew him for too great a coward to be trusted in the fight so I gave
him a safe task and yet in that he failed mefailed me because he had
betrayed and sold me

He had not I tell you he had not she insisted I swear it

He stared at her There was no one else for it he made answer and
bade her harshly stand aside

Diana huddled together watched and waited in horror for the end of
these consequences of her work

Blake made a sudden movement to win past Ruth Richard staggered to his
feet intent on defending himself but he was swordless retreat to the
door suggested itself and he had half turned to attempt to gain it
when Ruths next words arrested him petrified him

There was some one else for it Sir Rowland she cried It was not
Richard who betrayed you It it was I

You The fierceness seemed all to drop away from him whelmed in the
immensity of his astonishment You Then he laughed loud in scornful
disbelief You think to save him he said

Should I lie she asked him calm and brave

He stared at her stupidly he passed a hand across his brow and looked
at Diana Oh it is impossible he said at last

You shall hear she answered and told him how at the last moment she
had learnt not only that her husband was in Bridgwater but that he was
to sup at Newlingtons with the Dukes party

I had no thought of betraying you or of saving the Duke she said
I knew how justifiable was what you intended But I could not let Mr
Wilding go to his death I sought to detain him warning him only when
I thought it would be too late for him to warn others But you delayed
overlong and

A hoarse inarticulate cry from him came to interrupt her at that point
One glimpse of his face she had and of the hand half raised with sword
pointing towards her and she closed her eyes thinking that her sands
were run And indeed Blakes intention was just then to kill her That
he should owe his betrayal to her was in itself cause enough to
enrage him but that her motive should have been her desire to save
WildingWilding of all menthat was the last straw

Had he been forewarned that Wilding was to be one of Monmouths party at
Mr Newlingtons his pulses would have throbbed with joy and he would
have flung himself into his murderous task with twice the zest he had
carried to it And now he learnt that not only had she thwarted his
schemes against Monmouth but had deprived him of the ardently sought
felicity of widowing her He drew back his arm for the thrust
Diana huddled into her chair too horrorstricken to speak or move
Richardimmediately behind his sistersaw nothing of what was passing
and thought of nothing but his own safety

Then Blake paused stepped back returned his sword to its scabbard and
bending himselfbut whether to bow or not was not quite plainhe took
some paces backwards then turned and went out by the window as he had
come But there was a sudden purposefulness in the way he did it that
might have warned them this withdrawal was not quite the retreat it
seemed

They watched him with many emotions predominant among which was relief
and when he was gone Diana rose and came to Ruth

Come she said and sought to lead her from the room

But there was Richard now to be reckoned with Richard from whom the
palsy was of a sudden fallen now that the cause of it had withdrawn
He had his back to the door and his weak mouth was pursed up into a
semblance of resolution his pale eyes looked stern his white eyebrows
bent together in a frown

Wait he said They looked at him and the shadow of a smile almost
flitted across Dianas face He stepped to the door and opening it
held it wide Go Diana he said Ruth and I must understand each
other

Diana hesitated You had better go Diana said her cousin whereupon
Mistress Horton went

Hot and fierce came the recriminations from Richards lips when he and
his sister were alone and Ruth weathered the storm bravely until it
was stemmed again by fresh fear in Richard For Blake had suddenly
reappeared He came forward from his window his manner composed and
full of resolution Young Westmacott recoiled the heat all frozen out
of him But Blake scarce looked at him his smouldering glance was all
for Ruth who watched him with incipient fear despite herself

Madam he said tis not to be supposed a mind holding so much
thought for a husbands safety could find room for any concern as to
anothers I will ask you natheless to consider what tale I am to bear
Lord Feversham

What tale said she

Ayethat will account for what has chanced for my failure to
discharge the task entrusted me and for the slaughter of an officer of
his and twenty men

Why ask me this she demanded half angrily then suddenly bethinking
her of how she had ruined his enterprise and of the position in which
she had placed him she softened Her clear mind held justice very dear
She approached Oh I am sorrysorry Sir Rowland she cried

He sneered He had wiped some of the blood from his face but still
looked terrible enough

Sorry said he and laughed unpleasantly Youll come with me to
Feversham and tell him what you did said he

I She recoiled in fear

At once he informed her

Wha whats that faltered Richard calling up his manhood and
coming forward What are you saying Blake

Sir Rowland disdained to heed him Come mistress he said and
putting forward his hand he caught her wrist and pulled her roughly
towards him She struggled to free herself but he leered evilly upon
her no whit discomposed by her endeavours Though short of stature
he was a man of considerable bodily strength and she though tall was
slight of frame He released her wrist and before she realized what he
was about he had stooped passed an arm behind her knees another round
her waist and swinging her from her feet took her up bodily in his
arms He turned about and a scream broke from her

Hold cried Richard Hold you madman

Keep off or Ill make an end of you before I go roared Blake over
his shoulder for already he had turned about and was making for the
window apparently no more hindered by his burden than had she been a
doll

Richard sprang to the door Jasper he bawled Jasper He had no
weapons as we have seen else it may be that he had made an attempt to
use them

Ruth got a hand free and caught at the windowframe as Blake was leaping
through It checked their progress but did not sensibly delay it It
was unfortunately her wounded hand with which she had sought to cling
and with an angry brutal wrench Sir Rowland compelled her to unclose
her grasp He sped down the lawn towards the orchard where his horse
was tethered And now she knew in a subconscious sort of way why he had
earlier withdrawn He had gone to saddle for this purpose

She struggled now thinking that he would be too hampered to compel her
to his will He became angry and set her down beside his horse one arm
still holding her

Look you mistress he told her fiercely living or dead you come
with me to Feversham Choose now

His tone was such that she never doubted he would carry out his threat
And so in dull despair she submitted hoping that Feversham might be
a gentleman and would recognize and respect a lady Half fainting she
allowed him to swing her to the withers of his horse Thus they threaded
their way in the dim starlit night through the trees towards the gate

It stood open and they passed out into the lane There Sir Rowland put
his horse to the trot which he increased to a gallop when he was over
the bridge and clear of the town






CHAPTER XXI THE SENTENCE

Mr Wilding as we know was to remain at Bridgwater for the purpose of
collecting from Mr Newlington the fine which had been imposed upon him
It is by no means clear whether Monmouth realized the fullness of
the tragedy at the merchants house and whether he understood that
stricken with apoplexy at the thought of parting with so considerable a
portion of his fortune Mr Newlington had not merely fainted but had
expired under His Graces eyes If he did realize it he was cynically
indifferent and lest we should be doing him an injustice by assuming
this we had better give him the benefit of the doubt and take it that
in the subsequent bustle of departure his mind filled with the prospect
of the night attack to be delivered upon his uncles army atSedgemoor
he thought no more either of Mr Newlington or of Mr Wilding The
latter as we know had no place in the rebel army although a man of
his hands he was not a trained soldier and notwithstanding that he may
fully have intended to draw his sword for Monmouth when the time came
yet circumstances had led to his continuing after Monmouths landing the
more diplomatic work of movementman in which he had been engaged for
the months that had preceded it

So it befell that when Monmouths army marched out of Bridgwater at
eleven oclock on that Sunday night not to make for Gloucester and
Cheshire as was generally believed but to fall upon the encamped
Feversham at Sedgemoor and slaughter the royal army in their beds Mr
Wilding was left behind Trenchard was gone in command of his troop of
horse and Mr Wilding had for only company his thoughts touching the
singular happenings of that busy night

He went back to the sign of The Ship overlooking the Cross and kicking
off his sodden shoes he supped quietly in the room of which shattered
door and broken window reminded him of his odd interview with Ruth and
of the comedy of love she had enacted to detain him there The
thought of it embittered him the part she had played seemed to his
retrospective mind almost a wantons partfor all that in name she was
his wife And yet underlying a certain irrepressible nausea came the
reflection that after all her purpose had been to save his life It
would have been a sweet thought sweet enough to have overlaid that
other bitterness had he not insisted upon setting it down entirely to
her gratitude and her sense of justice She intended to repay the debt
in which she had stood to him since at the risk of his own life
and fortune he had rescued her brother from the clutches of the
LordLieutenant at Taunton

He sighed heavily as he thought of the results that had attended his
compulsory wedding of her In the intensity of his passion in
the blindness of his vanity which made him confidentgloriously
confidentthat did he make himself her husband she herself would make
of him her lover before long he had committed an unworthiness of which
it seemed he might never cleanse himself in life There was but one
amend as he had told her Let him make it and perhaps she wouldout
of gratitude if out of no other feelingcome to think more kindly
of him and that night it seemed to him as he sat alone in that mean
chamber that it were a better and a sweeter thing to earn some measure
of her esteem by death than to continue in a life that inspired her
hatred and resentment From which it will be seen how utterly he
disbelieved the protestations she had uttered in seeking to detain him
They werehe was assureda part of a scheme a trick to lull him
while Monmouth and his officers were being butchered And she had gone
the length of saying she loved him He regretted that being as he was
convinced of its untruth What cause had she to love him She hated him
and because she hated him she did not scruple to lie to himonce with
suggestions and this time with actual expression of affectionthat she
might gain her ends ends that concerned her brother and Sir Rowland
Blake Sir Rowland Blake The name was a very goad to his passion and
despair

He rose from the table and took a turn in the room moving noiselessly
in his stockinged feet He felt the need of air and action the
weariness of his flesh incurred in his long ride from London was cast
off or forgotten He must go forth He picked up his fine shoes of
Spanish leather but as luck would have itlittle though he guessed the
extent just thenhe found them hardening though still damp from the
dews of Mr Newlingtons garden He cast them aside and taking a key
from his pocket unlocked an oak cupboard and withdrew the heavy muddy
boots in which he had ridden from town He drew them on and taking
up his hat and sword went down the creaking stairs and out into the
street

Bridgwater had fallen quiet by now the army was gone and townsfolk were
in their beds Moodily unconsciously yet as if guided by a sort of
instinct he went down the High Street and then turned off into the
narrower lane that led in the direction of Lupton House By the gates
of this he paused recalled out of his abstraction and rendered aware
of whither his steps had led him by the sight of the hall door standing
open a black figure silhouetted against the light behind it What was
happening here Why were they not abed like all decent folk

The figure called to him in a quavering voice Mr Wilding Mr
Wilding for the light beating upon his face and figure from the
open door had revealed him The form came swiftly forward its steps
pattering down the walk another slenderer figure surged in its place
upon the threshold hovered there an instant then plunged down into the
darkness to come after it But the first was by now upon Mr Wilding

What is it Jasper he asked recognizing the old servant

Mistress Ruth wailed the fellow wringing his hands She she has
been carried off He got it out in gasps winded by his short run
and by the excitement that possessed him

No word said Wilding He just stood and stared scarcely understanding
and in that moment they were joined by Richard He seized Wilding by the
arm Blake has carried her off he cried

Blake said Mr Wilding and wondered with a sensation of nausea was
it an ordinary running away But Richards next words made it plain to
him that it was no amorous elopement nor even amorous abduction

He has carried her to Feversham for her betrayal of his tonights
plan to seize the Duke

That stirred Mr Wilding He wasted no time in idle questions or idler
complainings How long since he asked and it was he who clutched
Richard now by the shoulder and with a hand that hurt

Not ten minutes ago was the quavering answer

And you were at hand when it befell cried Wilding the scorn in his
voice rising superior to his agitation and fears for Ruth You were at
hand and could neither prevent nor follow him

Ill go with you now if youll give chase whimpered Richard feeling
himself for once the craven that he was

If echoed Wilding scornfully and dragged him past the gate and up
towards the house even as he spoke Is there room for a doubt of it
Have you horses at least

To spare said Richard as they hurried on They skirted the house and
found the stable door open as Blake had left it Old Jasper followed
with a lamp which burned steadily so calm was the air of that July
night In three minutes they had saddled a couple of nags in five they
were riding for the bridge and the road to Weston Zoyland

It is a miracle you remained in Bridgwater said Richard as they rode
How came you to be left behind

I had a task assigned me in the town against the Dukes return
tomorrow Wilding explained and he spoke almost mechanically his
mind full ofanguished bythoughts of Ruth

Against the Dukes return cried Richard first surprised and then
thinking that Wilding spoke at random Against the Dukes return he
repeated

That is what I said

But the Duke is marching to Gloucester

The Duke is marching by circuitous ways to Sedgemoor answered
Wilding never dreaming that at this time of day there could be the
slightest imprudence in saying so much indeed taking little heed of
what he said his mind obsessed by the other to him far weightier
matter

To Sedgemoor gasped Westmacott

Ayeto take Feversham by surpriseto destroy King Jamess soldiers in
their beds He should be near upon the attack by now But there Spur on
and save your breath if we are to overtake Sir Rowland

They pounded on through the night at a breakneck pace which they never
slackened until when within a quarter of a mile or so of Penzoy Pound
where the army was encamped and slumbering by now they caught sight of
the musketeers matches glowing in the dark ahead of them An outpost
barred their progress but Richard had the watchword and he spurred
ahead shouting Albemarle and the soldiers fell back and gave them
passage On they galloped skirting Penzoy Pound and the army sleeping
in utter unconsciousness of the fate that was creeping stealthily upon
it out of the darkness and mists across the moors they clattered on
past Langmoor Stone and dashed straight into the village Richard never
drawing rein until he reached the door of the cottage where Feversham
was lodged

They had come not only at a headlong pace but in a headlong manner
without quite considering what awaited them at the end of their ride in
addition to their object of finding Ruth It was only now as he drew
rein before the lighted house and caught the sound of Blakes raised
voice pouring through an open window on the ground floor that Richard
fully realized what manner of rashness he was committing He was too
late to rescue Ruth from Blake What more could he look to achieve
His hope had been that with Wildings help he might snatch her from Sir
Rowland before the latter reached his destination But nowto enter
Fevershams presence and in association with so notorious a rebel as Mr
Wilding were a piece of folly of the heroic kind that Richard did not
savour Indeed had it not been for Wildings masterful presence it is
more than odds he had turned tail and ridden home again to bed

But Wilding who had leapt nimbly to the ground stood waiting for
Richard to dismount impatient now that from the sound of Sir Rowlands
voice he had assurance that Richard had proved an able guide The young
man got down but might yet have hesitated had not Wilding caught him
by the arm and whirled him up the steps through the open door past
the two soldiers who kept it and who were too surprised to stay him
straight into the long lowceilinged chamber where Feversham attended
by a captain of horse was listening to Blakes angry narrative of that
nights failure

Mr Wildings entrance was decidedly sensational He stepped quickly
forward and taking Blake who was still talking all unconscious of
those behind him by the collar of his coat he interrupted him in the
middle of an impassioned period wrenched him backwards off his feet
and dashed him with a force almost incredible into a heap in a corner of
the room There for some moments the baronet lay half dazed by the shock
of his fall

A long table which seemed to divide the chamber in two stood between
Lord Feversham and his officer and Mr Wilding and Ruthby whose side
he had now come to stand in Blakes room

There was an exclamation half anger half amazement at Mr Wildings
outrage upon Sir Rowland and the captain of horse sprang forward
But Wilding raised his hand his face so composed and calm that it was
impossible to think him conceiving any violence as indeed he protested
at that moment

Be assured gentlemen he said that I have no further rudeness to
offer any so that this lady is suffered to withdraw with me And he
took in his own a hand that Ruth amazed and unresisting yielded up to
him That touch of his seemed to drive out her fears and to restore her
confidence the mortal terror in which she had been until his coming
dropped from her now She was no longer alone and abandoned to the
vindictiveness of rude and violent men She had beside her one in whom
experience had taught her to have faith

Louis Duras Marquis de Blanquefort and Earl of Feversham coughed with
mock discreetness under cover of his hand Ahem

He was a comely man with a long nose good lowlidded eyes a humorous
mouth and a weak chin at a glance he looked what he was a weak
goodnatured sensualist He was resplendent at the moment in a blue
satin dressinggown stiff with gold lace for he had been interrupted
by Blakes arrival in the very act of putting himself to bed and his
headdivested of his wigwas bound up in a scarf of many colours

At his side the redcoated captain arrested by the generals sardonic
cough stood a redfaced freckled boy looking to his superior for
orders

I tink you ave urt Sare Rowland said Feversham composedly in his
bad English Who are you sare

This ladys husband answered Wilding whereupon the captain stared
and Fevershams brows went up in surprised amusement

Soho Tat true quoth the latter in a tone suggesting that it
explained everything to him Tis gif a differen colour to your
story Sare Rowlan Then he added in a chuckle Ho holamour and
laughed outright

Blake gathering together his wits and his limbs at the same time made
shift to rise

What a plague does their relationship matter he began He would have
added more but the Frenchman thought this question one that needed
answering

Parbleu he swore his amusement rising It seem to matter
someting

Damn me swore Blake red in the face from pale that he had been Do
you conceive that if I had run away with his wife for her own sake I
had fetched her to you He lurched forward as he spoke but kept his
distance from Wilding who stood between Ruth and him

Feversham bowed sardonically You are a such flatterer Sare Rowlan
said he laughter bubbling in his words

Blake looked his scorn of this trivial Frenchman who upon scenting
what appeared to be the comedy of an outraged husband overtaking the
man who had carried off his wife forgot the serious business a part
of which Sir Rowland had already imparted to him Captain Wentwortha
timeserving gentlemansmiled with this French general of a British
army that he might win the great mans favour

I have told your lordship said Blake froth on his lips that
the twenty men I had from you as well as Ensign Norris are dead in
Bridgwater and that my plan to carry off King Monmouth has come to
ruin all because we were betrayed by this woman It is now my further
privilege to point out to your lordship the man to whom she sold us

Feversham misliked Sir Rowlands arrogant tone misliked his angry
scornful glance His eyes narrowed the laughter faded slowly from his
face

Yes yes I remember said he tis lady you have tole us betray
you Ver well But you have not tole us who betray you to tis lady
And he looked inquiringly at Blake

The baronets jaw dropped his face lost some of its high colour He
was stunned by the question as the bird is stunned that flies headlong
against a pane of glass He had crashed into an obstruction so
transparent that he had not seen it

So said Feversham and he stroked the cleft of his chin Captain
Wentwort be so kind as to call te guard

Wentworth moved to obey but before he had gone round the table Blake
had looked behind him and espied Richard shrinking by the door

By heaven he cried I can more than answer your lordships
question

Wentworth stopped looking at Feversham

Voyons said the General

I can place you in possession of the man who has wrought our ruin He
is there and he pointed theatrically to Richard

Feversham looked at the limp figure in some bewilderment Indeed he was
having a most bewildering eveningor morning rather for it was even
then on the stroke of one oclock An who are you sare he asked

Richard came forward nerving himself for what was to follow It had
just occurred to him that he held a card which should trump any trick of
Sir Rowlands vindictiveness and the prospect heartened and comforted
him

I am this ladys brother my lord he answered and his voice was
fairly steady

Tiens said Feversham and smiling he turned to Wentworth

Quite a family party sir said the captain smiling back

Oh mais toutfait said the General laughing outright and then
Wilding created a diversion by leading Ruth to a chair that stood at the
far end of the table and drawing it forward for her Ah yes said
Feversham airily let Madame sit

You are very good sir said Ruth her voice brave and calm

But somewhat lacking in spontaneity Wilding criticized which set
Wentworth staring and the Frenchman scowling

Shall I call the guard my lord asked Wentworth crisply

I tink yes said Feversham and the captain gained the door and
spoke a word to one of the soldiers without

But my lord exclaimed Blake in a tone of protest I vow you are too
ready to take this fellows word

He as spoke so few said Feversham

Do you know who he is

You af eard im sayte ladys usband

Ayebut his name cried Blake quivering with anger Do you know
that it is Wilding

The name certainly made an impression that might have flattered the man
to whom it belonged Fevershams whole manner changed the trivial air
of persiflage that he had adopted hitherto was gone on the instant and
his brow grew dark

Tat true he asked sharply Are you Mistaire WildinMistaire
Antoine Wildin

Your lordships most devoted servant said Wilding suavely and made a
leg

Wentworth in the background paused in the act of reclosing the door to
stare at this gentleman whose name Albemarle had rendered so excellently
well known

And you to dare come ere thundered Feversham thoroughly roused
by the others airy indifference You to dare come ereinto my ver
presence

Mr Wilding smiled conciliatingly I came for my wife my lord he
reminded him It grieves me to intrude upon your lordship at so late an
hour and indeed it was far from my intent I had hoped to overtake Sir
Rowland before he reached you

Nom de Dieu swore Feversham Ho A so great effrontery He swung
round upon Blake again Sare Rowlan he bade him angrily be so kind
to tell me what appen in Breechwatereveryting

Blake his face purple seemed to struggle for breath and words Mr
Wilding answered for him

Sir Rowland is so choleric my lord he said in his pleasant level
voice that perhaps the tale would come more intelligibly from
me Believe me that he has served you to the best of his ability
Unfortunately for the success of your choice plan of murder I had news
of it at the eleventh hour and with a party of musketeers I was able
to surprise and destroy your cutthroats in Mr Newlingtons garden
You see my lord I was to have been one of the victims myself and I
resented the attentions that were intended me I had no knowledge that
Sir Rowland had contrived to escape and frankly it is a thing I
deplore more than I can say for had that not happened much trouble
might have been saved and your lordships rest had not been disturbed

But te woman cried Feversham impatiently How is she come into this
galare

It was she who warned him Blake got out as already I have had the
honour to inform your lordship

And your lordship cannot blame her for that said Wilding The lady
is a most loyal subject of King James but she is also as you observe
a dutiful wife I will add that it was her intention to warn me only
when too late for interference Sir Rowland as it happened was slow
in

Silence blazed the Frenchman Now tat I know who you are tat make
a so great difference Where is te guard Wentwort

I hear them answered the captain and from the street came the tramp
of their marching feet

Feversham turned again to Blake Te affaire as appen so he
said between question and assertion summing up the situation as he
understood it Tis rogue and he pointed to Richard ave betray
your plan to is sister who betray it to er usband who save te Duc
de Monmoot Nestce pas

That is so said Blake and Ruth scarcely thought it worth while to
add that she had heard of the plot not only from her brother but from
Blake as well After all Blakes attitude in the matter his action in
bringing her to Feversham for punishment and to exculpate himself must
suffice to cause any such statement of hers to be lightly received by
the General

She sat in an anguished silence her eyes wide her face pale and
waited for the end of this strange business In her heart she did permit
herself to think that it would be difficult to assemble a group of
men less worthy of respect Choleric and vindictive Blake foolish
Feversham stupid Wentworth and timid Richardeven Richard did
not escape the unfavourable criticism they were undergoing in her
subconscious mind Only Wilding detached in that assemblyas he had
detached in another that she rememberedand stood out in sharp relief a
very man calm intrepid selfpossessed and if she was afraid she was
more afraid for him than for herself This was something that perhaps
she scarcely realized just then but she was to realize it soon

Feversham was speaking again asking Blake a fresh question And who
betray you to tis rogue

To Westmacott cried Blake He was in the plot with me He was left
to guard the rear to see that we were not taken by surprise and he
deserted his post Had he not done that there had been no disaster in
spite of Mr Wildings intervention

Fevershams brow was dark his eyes glittered as they rested on the
traitor

Tat true sare he asked him

Not quite put in Mr Wilding Mr Westmacott I think was
constrained away He did not intend

Taistoi blazed Feversham Did I interrogate you It is for Mistaire
Westercott to answer He set a hand on the table and leaned forward
towards Wilding his face very malign You shall to answer for
yourself Mistaire Wildin I promise you you shall to answer for
yourself He turned again to Richard Eh bien he snapped Will you
speak

Richard came forward a step he was certainly nervous and certainly
pale but neither as pale nor as nervous as from our knowledge of
Richard we might have looked to see him at that moment

It is in a measure true he said But what Mr Wilding has said is
more exact I was induced away I did not dream any could know of the
plan or that my absence could cause this catastrophe

So you went eh vaurien You tought tat be to do your duty eh And
it was you who tole your sistaire

I may have told her but not before she had the tale already from
Blake

Feversham sneered and shrugged Natural you will not speak true A
traitor I ave observe is always liar

Richard drew himself up he seemed invested almost with a new dignity
Your lordship is pleased to account me a traitor he inquired

A dam traitor said his lordship and at that moment the door opened
and a sergeant with six men following him stood at the salute upon the
threshold A la bonne heure his lordship hailed them Sergean you
will arrest tis rogue and tis ladyhe waved his hand from Richard
to Ruthand you will take tem to lockup

The sergeant advanced towards Richard who drew a step away from him
Ruth rose to her feet in agitation Mr Wilding interposed himself
between her and the guard his hand upon his sword

My lord he cried do they teach no better courtesy in France

Feversham scowled at him smiling darkly I shall talk wit you soon
sare said he his words a threat

But my lord began Richard I can make it very plain I am no
traitor

In te mornin said Feversham blandly waving his hand and the
sergeant took Richard by the shoulder

But Richard twisted from his grasp In the morning will be too late
he cried I have it in my power to render you such a service as you
little dream of

Take im away said Feversham wearily

I can save you from destruction bawled Richard you and your army

Perhaps even now Feversham had not heeded him but for Wildings sudden
interference

Silence Richard he cried to him Would you betray He checked
on the word more he dared not say but he hoped faintly that he had
said enough

Feversham however chanced to observe that this man who had shown
himself hitherto so calm looked suddenly most singularly perturbed

Eh quoth the General An instan Sergean What is tis ehand
he looked from Wilding to Richard

Your lordship shall learn at a price cried Richard

Me I not bargain wit traitors said his lordship stiffly

Very well then answered Richard and he folded his arms
dramatically But no matter what your lordships life may be hereafter
you will never regret anything more bitterly than you shall regret this
by sunrise if indeed you live to see it

Feversham shifted uneasily on his feet What you say he asked What
you mean

You shall know at a price said Richard again

Wilding realizing the hopelessness of interfering now stood gloomily
apart a great bitterness in his soul at the indiscretion he had
committed in telling Richard of the night attack that was afoot

Your lordship shall hear my price but you need not pay it me until you
have had an opportunity of verifying the information I have to give you

Tell me said Feversham after a brief pause during which he
scrutinized the young mans face

If your lordship will promise liberty and safeconduct to my sister and
myself

Tell me Feversham repeated

When you have promised to grant me what I ask in return for my
information

Yes if I tink your information is wort

I am content said Richard He inclined his head and loosed the
quarrel of his news Your camp is slumbering your officers are all
abed with the exception of the outpost on the road to Bridgwater What
should you say if I told you that Monmouth and all his army are marching
upon you at this very moment will probably fall upon you before another
hour is past

Wilding uttered a groan and his hands fell to his sides Had Feversham
observed this he might have been less ready with his sneering answer

A lie he answered and laughed My fren I ave myself been
tonight at midnight on te moore and I ave eard te army of te
Duc de Monmoot marching to Bristol on te roadwhat you call te road
Wentwort

The Eastern Causeway my lord answered the captain

Voil said Feversham and spread his hands What you say now eh

That that is part of Monmouths plan to come at you across the moors
by way of Chedzoy avoiding your only outpost and falling upon you in
your beds all unawares Lord sir do not take my word for it Send out
your scouts and I dare swear theyll not need go far before they come
upon the enemy

Feversham looked at Wentworth His lordships face had undergone a
change

What you tink he asked

Indeed my lord it sounds so likely answered Wentworth that
that I marvel we did not provide against such a contingency

But I ave provide cried this nephew of the great Turenne
Ogeltorpe is on te moor and Sare Francis Compton If tis is true
ow can tey ave miss Monmoot Send word to Milor Churchill at once
Wentwort Let te matter be investigateat once Wentwortat once
The General was dancing with excitement Wentworth saluted and turned to
leave the room If you ave tole me true continued Feversham turning
now to Richard you shall ave te price you ask and te tanks of te
Kings army But if not

Oh its true enough broke in Wilding and his voice was like a
groan his face overcharged with gloom

Feversham looked at him his sneering smile returned

Me I not remember said he that Mr Westercott ave include you in
te bargain

Nothing had been further from Wildings thoughts than such a suggestion
And he snorted his disdain The sergeant had fallen back at Fevershams
words and his men lined the wall of the chamber The General bade
Richard be seated whilst he waited Sir Rowland stood apart leaning
wearily against the wainscot waiting also his dull wits not quite
clear how Richard might have come by so valuable a piece of information
his evil spirit almost wishing it untrue in his vindictiveness to the
end that Richard might pay the price of having played him false and Ruth
the price of having scorned him

Feversham meanwhile was seekingwith no great successto engage
Mr Wilding in talk of Monmouth against whom Feversham harboured in
addition to his political enmity a very deadly personal hatred for
Feversham had been a suitor to the hand of the Lady Henrietta Wentworth
the woman for whom Monmouthworthy son of his fatherhad practically
abandoned his own wife the woman with whom he had run off to the great
scandal of court and nation

Despairing of drawing any useful information from Wilding his lordship
was on the point of turning to Blake when quick steps and the rattle of
a scabbard sounded without the door was thrust open without ceremony
and Captain Wentworth reappeared

My lord he cried his manner excited beyond aught one could have
believed possible in so phlegmaticseeming a person it is true We are
beset

Beset echoed Feversham Beset already

We can hear them moving on the moor They are crossing the Langmoor
Rhine They will be upon us in ten minutes at the most I have roused
Colonel Douglas and Dunbartons regiment is ready for them

Feversham exploded What else ave you done he asked Where is
Milor Churchill

Lord Churchill is mustering his men as quietly as may be that they may
be ready to surprise those who come to surprise us By Heaven sir we
owe a great debt to Mr Westmacott Without his information we might
have had all our throats cut whilst we slept

Be so kind to call Belmont said Feversham Tell him to bring my
clotes

Wentworth turned and went out again to execute the Generals orders
Feversham spoke to Richard We are oblige Mr Westercott said he
We are ver much oblige

Suddenly from a little distance came the roll of drums Other sounds
began to stir in the night outside to tell of a waking army

Feversham stood listening It is Dunbartons he murmured Then with
some show of heat Ah pardieu he cried But it was a dirty ting
tis Monmoot ave prepare It is murder it is not te war

And yet said Wilding critically it is a little more like war than
the Bridgwater affair to which your lordship gave your sanction

Feversham pursed his lips and considered the speaker Wentworth
reentered followed by the Earls valet carrying an armful of garments
His lordship threw off his dressinggown and stood forth in shirt and
breeches

Mais duchetoi donc Belmont said he Nous nous battons Ii faut
que je mhabille Belmont a little wizened fellow who understood
nothing of this topsyturveydom hastened forward deposited his armful
on the table and selected a finely embroidered waistcoat which he
proceeded to hold for his master Wriggling into it Feversham rapped
out his orders

Captain Wentwort you will go to your regimen at once But first
ahwait Take tose six men and Mistaire Wilding Ave im shot at
once you onderstan eh Good Allons Belmont my cravat






CHAPTER XXII THE EXECUTION

Captain Wentworth clicked his heels together and saluted Blake in the
background drew a deep breathunmistakably of satisfaction and his
eyes glittered A muffled cry broke from Ruth who rose instantly from
her chair her hand on her bosom Richard stood with fallen jaw amazed
a trifle troubled even whilst Mr Wilding started more in surprise than
actual fear and approached the table

You heard sir said Captain Wentworth

I heard answered Mr Wilding quietly But surely not aright One
moment sir and he waved his hand so compellingly that despite the
order he had received the phlegmatic captain hesitated

Feversham who had taken the cravata yard of priceless Dutch
lacefrom the hands of his valet and was standing with his back to the
company at a small and very faulty mirror that hung by the overmantel
looked peevishly over his shoulder

My lord said Wilding and Blake for all his hatred of this man
marvelled at a composure that did not forsake him even now you are
surely not proposing to deal with me in this fashionnot seriously my
lord

Ah ca said the Frenchman Tink it a jest if you please What for
you come ere

Assuredly not for the purpose of being shot said Wilding and
actually smiled Then in the tones of one discussing a matter that is
grave but not of surpassing gravity he continued It is not that I
fail to recognize that I may seem to have incurred the rigour of the
law but these matters must be formally proved against me I have
affairs to set in order against such a consummation

Ta ta snapped Feversham Tat not regard me Weutwort you ave
eard my order And he returned to his mirror and the nice adjustment
of his neckwear

But my lord insisted Wilding you have not the rightyou have not
the power so to proceed against me A man of my quality is not to be
shot without a trial

You can ang if you prefer said Feversham indifferently drawing out
the ends of his cravat and smoothing them down upon his breast He faced
about briskly Give me tat coat Belmont His Majesty ave empower me
to ang or shoot any gentlemens of te partie of te Duc te Monmoot on
te spot I say tat for your satisfaction And look I am desolate to
be so quick wit you but please to consider te circumstance Te enemy
go to attack Wentwort must go to his regimen and my oter
officers are all occupi You comprehen I ave not te time to spare
younestcepasWentworths hand touched Wilding on the shoulder
He was standing with head slightly bowed his brows knit in thought He
looked round at the touch sighed and smiled

Belmont held the coat for his master who slipped into it and flung
at Wilding what was intended for a consolatory sop It is fortune de
guerre Mistaire Wilding I am desolate but it is fortune of te war

May it be less fortunate for your lordship then said Wilding dryly
and was on the point of turning when Ruths voice came in a loud cry to
startle him and to quicken his pulses

My lord It was a cry of utter anguish

Feversham settling his goldlaced coat comfortably to his figure
looked at her Madame said he

But she had nothing to say She stood deathly white slightly bent
forward one hand wringing the other her eyes almost wild her bosom
heaving frantically

Hum said Feversham and he loosened and removed the scarf from his
head He shrugged slightly and looked at Wentworth Finissons said
he

The word and the look snapped the trammels that bound Ruths speech

Five minutes my lord she cried imploringly Give him five
minutesand me my lord

Wilding deeply shaken trembled now as he awaited Fevershams reply

The Frenchman seemed to waver Bien he began spreading his hands
And in that moment a shot rang out in the night and startled the whole
company Feversham threw back his head the signs of yielding left his
face Ha he cried Tey are arrive He snatched his wig from his
lacqueys hands donned it and turned again an instant to the mirror
to adjust the great curls Quick Wentwort Tere is no more time now
Make Mistaire Wilding be shot at once Ten to your regimen He faced
about and took the sword his valet proffered Au revoir messieurs

Serviteur madame And buckling his swordbelt as he went he swept
out leaving the door wide open Belmont following Wentworth saluting
and the guards presenting arms

Come sir said the captain in a subdued voice his eyes avoiding
Ruths face

I am ready answered Wilding firmly and he turned to glance at his
wife

She was bending towards him her hands held out such a look on her face
as almost drove him mad with despair reading it as he did He made a
sound deep in his throat before he found words

Give me one minute sirone minute he begged Wentworth I ask no
more than that

Wentworth was a gentleman and not illnatured But he was a soldier and
had received his orders He hesitated between the instincts of the
two conditions And what time he did so there came a clatter of hoofs
without to resolve him It was Feversham departing

You shall have your minute sir said he More I dare not give you
as you can see

From my heart I thank you answered Mr Wilding and from the
gratitude of his tone you might have inferred that it was his life
Wentworth had accorded him

The captain had already turned aside to address his men Two of you
outside guard that window he ordered The rest of you in the
passage Bestir there

Take your precautions by all means sir said Wilding but I give
you my word of honour I shall attempt no escape

Wentworth nodded without replying His eye lighted on Blakewho had
been seemingly forgotten in the confusionand on Richard A kindliness
for the man who met his end so unflinchingly a respect for so worthy an
enemy actuated the redfaced captain

You had better take yourself off Sir Rowland said he And you Mr
Westmacottyou can wait in the passage with my men

They obeyed him promptly enough but when outside Sir Rowland made
bold to remind the captain that he was failing in his duty and that
he should make a point of informing the General of this anon Wentworth
bade him go to the devil and so was rid of him

Alone inside that lowceilinged chamber stood Ruth and Wilding face
to face He advanced towards her and with a shuddering sob she flung
herself into his arms Still he mistrusted the emotion to which she
was a preydreading lest it should have its root in pity He patted her
shoulder soothingly

Nay nay little child he whispered in her ear Never weep for
me that have not a tear for myself What better resolution of the
difficulties my folly has created For only answer she clung closer
her hands locked about his neck her slender body shaken by her silent
weeping Dont pity me he besought her I am content it should be
so It is the amend I promised you Waste no pity on me Ruth

She raised her face her eyes wild and blurred with tears looked up to
his

It is not pity she cried I want you Anthony I love you Anthony
Anthony

His face grew ashen It is true then he asked her And what you
said tonight was true I thought you said it only to detain me

Oh it is true it is true she wailed

He sighed he disengaged a hand to stroke her face I am happy he
said and strove to smile Had I lived who knows

No no no she interrupted him passionately her arms tightening
about his neck He bent his head Their lips met and clung A knock
fell upon the door They started and Wilding raised his hands gently to
disengage her pinioning arms

I must go sweet he said

God help me she moaned and clung to him still It is I who am
killing youI and your love for me For it was to save me you rode
hither tonight never pausing to weigh your own deadly danger Oh I
am punished for having listened to every voice but the voice of my own
heart where you were concerned Had I loved you earlierhad I owned it
earlier

It had still been too late he said more to comfort her than because
he knew it to be so Be brave for my sake Ruth You can be brave I
knowso well Listen sweet Your words have made me happy Mar not
this happiness of mine by sending me out in grief at your grief

Her response to his prayer was brave indeed Through her tears came a
faint smile to overspread her face so white and pitiful

We shall meet soon again she said

Ayethink on that he bade her and pressed her to him Goodbye
sweet God keep you till we meet he added his voice infinitely
tender

Mr Wilding Wentworths voice called him and the captain thrust the
door open a foot or so Mr Wilding

I am coming he answered steadily He kissed her again and on that
kiss of his she sank against him and he felt her turn all limp He
raised his voice Richard he shouted wildly Richard

At the note of alarm in his voice Wentworth flung wide the door
and entered Richards ashen face showing over his shoulder In her
brothers care Wilding delivered his mercifully unconscious wife See
to her Dick he said and turned to go mistrusting himself now
But he paused as he reached the door Wentworth waxing more and more
impatient at his elbow He turned again

Dick he said we might have been better friends I would we had
been Let us part so at least and he held out his hand smiling

Before so much gallantry Richard was conquered almost to the point of
worship a weak man himself there was no virtue he could more admire
than strength He left Ruth in the highbacked chair in which Wildings
tender hands had placed her and sprang forward tears in his eyes He
wrung Wildings hands in wordless passion

Be good to her Dick said Wilding and went out with Wentworth

He was marched down the street in the centre of that small party of
musketeers of Dunbartons regiment his thoughts all behind him rather
than ahead a smile on his lips He had conquered at the last He
thought of that other parting of theirs nearly a month ago on the road
by Walford Now as then circumstance was the fire that had melted her
But the crucible was no longeras then of pity it was the crucible of
love

And in that same crucible too Anthony Wildings nature had undergone a
transmutation his love for Ruth had been purified of that base alloy of
desire which had driven him into the unworthiness of making her his own
at all costs there was no carnal grossness in his present passion it
was pure as a religionthe love that takes no account of self the love
that makes for joyous and grateful martyrdom And a joyous and grateful
martyr would Anthony Wilding have been could he have thought that his
death would bring her happiness or peace In such a faith as that he had
marchedor so he thought blithely to his end and the smile on his lips
had been less wistful than it was Thinking of the agony in which he had
left her he almost came to wishso pure was his love grownthat he
had not conquered The joy that at first was his was now all dashed His
death would cause her pain His death O God It is an easy thing to be
a martyr but this was not martyrdom having done what he had done he
had not the right to die The last vestige of the smile that he had worn
faded from his tightpressed lips tightpressed as though to endure
some physical suffering His face greyed and deep lines furrowed
his brow Thus he marched on mechanically amid his marching escort
through the murky fogladen night taking no heed of the stir about
them for all Weston Zoyland was aroused by now

Ahead of them and over to the east the firing blazed and crackled
volley upon volley to tell them that already battle had been joined
in earnest Monmouths surprise had aborted and it passed through
Wildings mind that to a great extent he was to blame for this But it
gave him little care

At least his indiscretion had served the purpose of rescuing Ruth from
Lord Fevershams unclean clutches For the rest knowing that Monmouths
army by far outnumbered Fevershams he had no doubt that the advantage
must still lie with the Duke in spite of Fevershams having been warned
in the eleventh hour

Louder grew the sounds of battle Above the din of firing a swelling
chorus rose upon the night startling and weird in such a time and
place Monmouths pious infantry went into action singing hymns and
Wentworth impatient to be at his post bade his men go faster

The night was by now growing faintly luminous and the deathly grey
light of approaching dawn hung in the mists upon the moor Objects grew
visible in bulk at least if not in form and shape by the time the
little company had reached the end of Weston village and come upon
the deep mud dyke which had been Wentworths objectivea ditch that
communicated with the great rhine that served the Kings forces so well
on that night of Sedgemoor

Within some twenty paces of this Wentworth called a halt and would have
had Wildings hands pinioned behind him and his eyes blindfolded but
that Wilding begged him this might not be done Wentworth was as we
know impatient and between impatience and kindliness perhaps he
acceded to Wildings prayer

He even hesitated a moment at the last It was in his mind to speak some
word of comfort to the doomed man Then a sudden volley more terrific
than any that had preceded it followed by hoarse cheering away to
eastward quickened his impatience He bade the sergeant lead Mr
Wilding forward and stand him on the edge of the ditch His object was
that thus the mans body would be disposed of without waste of time
This Wilding realized his soul rebelling against this fate which
had come upon him in the very hour when he most desired to live Mad
thoughts of escape crossed his mindof a leap across the dyke and a
wild dash through the fog But the futility of it was too appalling
The musketeers were already blowing their matches He would suffer the
ignominy of being shot in the back like a coward if he made any such
attempt

And so despairing but not resigned he took his stand on the very edge
of the ditch In an irony of obligingness he set half of his heels over
the void so that he was nicely balanced upon the edge of the cutting
and must go backwards and down into the mud when hit

It was this position he had taken that gave him an inspiration in that
last moment The sergeant had moved away out of the line of fire and he
stood there alone waiting erect and with his head held high his
eyes upon the grey mass of musketeersblurred alike by mist and
semidarknesssome twenty paces distant along the line of which glowed
eight red fuses

Wentworths voice rang out with the words of command

Blow your matches

Brighter gleamed the points of light and under their steel pots the
faces of the musketeers suffused by a dull red glow sprang for a
moment out of the grey mass to fade once more into the general greyness
at the word Cock your matches

Guard your pans came a second later the captains voice and then

Present

There was a stir and rattle and the dark indistinct figure standing
on the lip of the ditch was covered by the eight muskets To the eyes of
the firingparty he was no more than a blurred shadowy form showing a
little darker than the encompassing dark grey

Give fire

On the word Mr Wilding lost the delicate precarious balance he had
been sustaining on the edge of the ditch and went over backwards at
the imminent riskas he afterwards relatedof breaking his neck
At the same instant a jagged eightpointed line of flame slashed the
darkness and the thunder of the volley pealed forth to lose itself in
the greater din of battle on Penzoy Pound hard by






CHAPTER XXIII MR WILDINGS BOOTS

In the filth of the ditch Mr Wilding rolled over and lay prone He
threw out his left arm and rested his brow upon it to keep his face
above the mud He strove to hold his breath not that he might dissemble
death but that he might avoid being poisoned by the foul gases that
disturbed by his weight bubbled up to choke him His body half sank
and settled in the mud and seen from above as he was presently seen
by Wentworthwho ran forward with the sergeants lanthorn to assure
himself that the work had been well donehe had all the air of being
not only dead but already half buried

And now for a second Mr Wilding was in his greatest danger and this
from the very humaneness of the sergeant The fellow advanced to the
captains side a pistol in his hand Wentworth held the light aloft and
peered down into that six feet of blackness at the jacent figure

Shall I give him an ounce of lead to make sure Captain quoth the
sergeant But Wentworth in his great haste had already turned about
and the light of his lanthorn no longer revealed the form of Mr
Wilding

There is not the need The ditch will do what may remain to be done if
anything does Come on man We are wanted yonder

The light passed steps retreated the sergeant muttering and then
Wentworths voice was heard by Wilding some little distance off

Bring up your muskets

Shoulder

By the rightturn March And the tramp tramp of feet receded
rapidly

Wilding was already sitting up endeavouring to get a breath of purer
air He rose to his feet sinking almost to the top of his boots in
the oozy slime Foul gases were belched up to envelop him He seized
at irregularities in the bank and got his head above the level of the
ground He thrust forward his chin and took great greedy breaths in a
very gluttony of airand never came Muscadine sweeter to a drunkards
lips He laughed softly to himself He was alone and safe Wentworth
and his men had disappeared Away in the direction of Penzoy Pound the
sounds of battle swelled ever to a greater volume Cannons were booming
now and all was uproarflame and shouting cheering and shrieking
the thunder of hastening multitudes the clash of steel the pounding of
horses all blent to make up the horrid din of carnage

Mr Wilding listened and considered what to do His first impulse was
to join the fray But bethinking him that there could be little place
for him in the confusion that must prevail by now he reconsidered the
matter and his thoughts returning to Ruththe wife for whom he had
been at such pains to preserve himself on the very brink of deathhe
resolved to endanger himself no further for that night

He dropped back into the ditch and waded ankle deep in slime to the
other side There he crawled out and gaining the moor lay down awhile
to breathe his lungs But not for long The dawn was creeping pale and
ghostly across the solid earth and a faint fresh breeze was stirring
and driving the mist in wispy shrouds before it If he lingered there he
might yet be found by some party of Royalist soldiers and that would be
to undo all that he had done He rose and struck out across the peaty
ground None knew the moors better than did he and had he been with
Greys horse that night it is possible things had fared differently
for he had proved a surer guide than did Godfrey the spy

At first he thought of making for Bridgwater and Lupton House By now
Richard would be on his way thither with Ruth and Wilding was in haste
that she should be reassured that he had not fallen to the muskets
of Wentworths firingparty But Bridgwater was far and he began
to realize now that all excitement was past that he was utterly
exhausted Next he thought of Scoresby Hall and his cousin Lord Gervase
But he was by no means sure that he might count upon a welcome Gervase
had shown no sympathy for Monmouth or his partisans and whilst he would
hardly go so far as to refuse Mr Wilding shelter still Wilding felt an
aversion to seeking what might be grudged him At last he bethought him
of home Zoyland Chase was near at hand but he had not been there since
his weddingday and in the mean time he knew that it had been used as
a barrack for the militia and had no doubt that it had been wrecked and
plundered Still it must have walls and a roof and that for the time
was all he craved that he might rest awhile and recuperate his wasted
forces

A halfhour later he dragged himself wearily up the avenue between the
elmslooking white as snow in the pale July dawnto the clearing in
front of his house

Desertion was stamped upon the face of it Shattered windows and hanging
shutters everywhere How wantonly they had wrecked it It might have
been a church and the militia a regiment of Cromwells iconoclastic
Puritans The door was locked but going round he found a windowone
of the doorwindows of his libraryhanging loose upon its hinges He
pushed it wide and entered with a heavy heart Instantly something
stirred in a corner a fierce growl was followed by a furious bark and
a lithe brown body leapt from the greater into the lesser shadows to
attack the intruder But at one word of his the hound checked suddenly
crouched an instant then with a queer throaty sound bounded forward in
a wild delight that robbed it on the instant of its voice It found it
anon and leapt about him barking furious joy in spite of all his
vain endeavours to calm it He grew afraid lest the dog should draw
attention He knew not whoif anymight be in possession of his
house The library as he looked round showed a scene of wreckage that
excellently matched the exterior Not a picture on the walls not an
arras but had been rent to shreds The great lustre that had hung
from the centre of the ceiling was gone Disorder reigned along
the bookshelves and yet there and elsewhere there was a certain
orderliness suggesting an attempt to straighten up the place after
the ravagers had departed It was these signs made him afraid the house
might be tenanted by such as might prove his enemies

Down Jack he said to the dog for the twentieth time patting its
sleek head Down down

But still the dog bounded about him barking wildly

Sh he hissed suddenly Steps sounded in the hall It was as he
feared The door was suddenly thrown open and the grey morning light
gleamed upon the long barrel of a musket After it bearing it entered
a whitehaired old man

He paused on the threshold measuring the tall disordered stranger who
stood there his figure a black silhouette against the window by which
he had entered

What seek you here sir in this house of desolation asked the voice
of Mr Wildings old servant

He answered but one word Walters

The musket dropped with a clatter from the old mans hands He sank back
against the doorpost and leaned there an instant then whimpering and
laughing he came tottering forwardhis old legs failing him in this
excess of unexpected joyand sank on his knees to kiss his masters
hand

Wilding patted the old head as he had patted the dogs a little while
ago He was oddly moved there was a knot in his throat No homecoming
could well have been more desolate And yet what homecoming could have
brought him such a torturing joy as was now his Oh it is good to be
loved if it be by no more than a dog and an old servant

In a moment Walters was himself again He was on his feet scrutinizing
Wildings haggard face and disordered filthy clothes He broke into
exclamations between dismay and reproach but these Wilding interrupted
to ask the old man how it happened that he had remained

My son John was a sergeant in the troop that quartered itself here
sir Walters explained and so they left me alone But even had it not
been for that I scarcely think they would have harmed an old man They
were brave fellows for all the mischief they did here and they seemed
to have little heart in the service of the Popish King It was
the officers drove them on to all this damage and once theyd
startedwell there were rogues amongst them saw a chance of plunder
and they took it I have sought to put the place to rights but they did
some woeful wanton mischief

Wilding sighed Its little matter perhaps as the place is no longer
mine

No no longer yours sir

Im an attainted outlaw Walters he explained Theyll bestow it on
some Popish timeserver unless King Monmouth can follow up by greater
victories tonights Have you aught a man may eat or drink

Meat and wine fresh linen and fresh garments did old Walters find him
and when he had washed eaten and drunk Mr Wilding wrapped himself
in a dressinggown and laid himself down to sleep on a settle in the
library his servant and his dog on guard

Not above an hour however was he destined to enjoy his hardearned
rest The light had grown meanwhile and from grey it had turned
golden the heralds of the sun being already in the east In the
distance the firing had died down to a mere occasional boom

Suddenly old Walters raised his head to listen The beat of hoofs was
drawing rapidly near so near that presently he rose in alarm for
a horseman was pounding up the avenue had drawn rein at the main
entrance

Walters knit his brows in perplexity and glanced at his master who
slept on utterly worn out A silent pause followed lasting some
minutes Then it was the dog that rose with a growl his coat bristling
and an instant later there came a sharp rapping at the hall door

Sh Down Jack whispered Walters afraid of rousing Mr Wilding He
tiptoed softly across the room picked up his musket and calling the
dog went out a great fear in his heart but not for himself

The rapping continued growing every instant more urgent so urgent that
Walters was almost reassured Here was no enemy but surely some one
in need Walters opened at last and Mr Trenchard grimy of face and
hands his hat shorn of its plumes his clothes torn staggered with an
oath across the threshold

Walters he cried Thank God I thought youd be here but I wasnt
certain Down Jack

The hound was barking madly again having recognized an old friend

Plague on the dog growled Walters Hell wake Mr Wilding

Mr Wilding said Trenchard and checked midway across the hall Mr
Wilding

He arrived here a couple of hours ago sir

Wilding here Oddsheart I was more than well advised to come Where is
he man

Sh sir Hes asleep in the library Youll wake him youll wake him

But Trenchard never paused He crossed the hall at a bound and flung
wide the library door Anthony he shouted Anthony And in the
background Walters cursed him for a fool Wilding leapt to his feet
awake and startled

Wha Nick

Oons roared Nick Youre choicely found I came to send to
Bridgwater for you We must away at once man

Howaway I thought you were in the fight Nick

And dont I look as if I had been

But then

The fight is fought and lost theres an end to the garboil Monmouth
is in full flight with whats left him of his horse When I quitted the
field he was riding hard for Polden Hill He dropped into a chair his
accents grim and despairing his eyes haggard

Lost gasped Wilding and his conscience pricked him for a moment
remembering how much it had been his faulthowever indirectlythat
Feversham had been forewarned But how lost he cried a moment later

Ask Grey snapped Trenchard Ask his craven numskulled lordship He
had as good a hand in losing it as any Oh it was all most infernally
mishandled as has been everything in this illstarred rising Grey sent
back Godfrey the guide and attempted in the dark to find his own way
across the rhine He missed the ford What else could the fool have
hoped And when he was discovered and Dunbartons guns began to play on
ushell and fire we ran as if Sedgemoor had been a racecourse

The rest was but the natural sequel The foot seeing our confusion
broke They were rallied again broke again and again were rallied but
all too late The enemy was up and with that damned ditch between us
there was no getting to close quarters with them Had Grey ridden round
and sought to turn their flank things might have beenO Godthey
would have been entirely different I did suggest it But for my pains
Grey threatened to pistol me if I presumed to instruct him in his duty
I would to Heaven I had pistolled him where he stood

Walters at gaze in the doorway listened to the bitter tirade Wilding
on the settle sat silent a moment his elbows on his knees his chin
in his hands his eyes set and grim as Trenchards own Then he mastered
himself and waved a hand towards the table where stood food and wine

Eat and drink Nick he said and well discuss whats to be done

Itll need little discussing was Nicks savage answer as he rose and
went to pour himself a cup of wine Theres but one course open to us
instant flight I am for Minehead to join Hewlings horse which went
there yesterday for guns We might seize a ship somewhere on the coast
and thus get out of this infernal country of mine

They discussed the matter in spite of Trenchards having said that there
was nothing to discuss and in the end Wilding agreed to go with him
What choice had he But first he must go to Bridgwater to reassure his
wife

To Bridgwater blazed Trenchard in a passion at the folly of the
suggestion Youre clearly mad All the Kings forces will be there in
an hour or two

No matter said Wilding I must go I am dead already as it
happens And he related his singular adventure in Fevershams camp last
night

Trenchard heard him in amazement If any suspicion crossed his mind that
his friends love affairs had had anything to do with rousing Feversham
prematurely he showed no sign of it But he shook his head at Wildings
insistence that he must first go to Lupton House

Shalt send a message Anthony Walters will find some one to bear it
But you must not go yourself

In the end Mr Trenchard prevailed upon him to adopt this course
however reluctant he might be Thereafter they proceeded to make their
preparations There were still a couple of nags in the stables in spite
of the visitation of the militia and Walters was able to find fresh
clothes for Mr Trenchard abovestairs

A halfhour later they were ready to set out on this forlorn hope of
escape the horses were at the door and Mr Wilding was in the act
of drawing on the fresh pair of boots which Walters had fetched him
Suddenly he paused his foot in the leg of his right boot and sat
bemused a moment

Trenchard watching him waxed impatient What ails you now he
croaked

Without answering him Wilding turned to Walters Where are the boots
I wore last night he asked and his voice was sharpoddly sharp
considering how trivial the matter of his speech

In the kitchen answered Walters

Fetch me them And he kicked off again the boot he had half drawn on

But they are all befouled with mud sir

Clean them Walters clean them and let me have them

Still Walters hesitated pointing out that the boots he had brought his
master were newer and sounder Wilding interrupted him impatiently Do
as I bid you Walters And the old man understanding nothing went off
on the errand

A pox on your boots swore Trenchard What does this mean

Wilding seemed suddenly to have undergone a transformation His gloom
had fallen from him He looked up at his old friend and smiling
answered him It means Nick that whilst these excellent boots that
Walters would have me wear might be well enough for a ride to the coast
such as you propose they are not at all suited to the journey I intend
to make

Maybe said Nick with a sniff youre intending to journey to Tower
Hill

In that direction answered Mr Wilding suavely

I am for London Nick And you shall come with me

God save us Do you keep a fools egg under that nest of hair

Wilding explained and by the time Walters returned with the boots
Trenchard was walking up and down the room in an odd agitation Odds my
life Tony he cried at last I believe it is the best thing

The only thing Nick

And since all is lost why Trenchard blew out his cheeks and
smacked fist into palm I am with you said he






CHAPTER XXIV JUSTICE

It has fallen to my lot in the course of this veridical chronicle of Mr
Anthony Wildings connection with the Rebellion in the West and of his
wedding and postnuptial winning of Ruth Westmacott to relate certain
matters of incident and personality that may be accounted strange But
the strangest yet remains to be related For in spite of all that had
passed between Sir Rowland Blake and the Westmacotts on that memorable
night of Sunday to Monday on which the battle of Sedgemoor was lost
and won towards the end of that same month of July we find him not only
back at Lupton House but once again the avowed suitor of Mr Wildings
widow For effrontery this is a matter of which it is to be doubted
whether history furnishes a parallel Indeed until the circumstances
are sifted it seems wild and incredible So let us consider these

On the morrow of Sedgemoor the town of Bridgwater became
investedinfested were no whit too strong a wordby the Kings forces
under Feversham and the odious Kirke and there began a reign of terror
for the town The prisons were choked with attainted and suspected
rebels From Bridgwater to Weston Zoyland the road was become an avenue
of gallows each bearing its repulsive grimaceladen burden for the
Kings commands were unequivocal and hanging was the order of the day

It is not my desire at this stage to surfeit you with the horrors that
were perpetrated during that hideous week of July when no mans life
was safe from the royal butchers The awful campaign of Jeffries and
his four associates was yet to follow but it is doubtful if it could
compare in ruthlessness with that of Feversham and Kirke At least when
Jeffries came men were given a trialor what looked like itand there
remained them a chance however slender of acquittal as many lived to
prove thereafter With Feversham there was no such chance And it was
of this circumstance that Sir Rowland Blake took the fullest and the
cowardliest advantage

There can be no doubt that Sir Rowland was a villain It might be
urged for him that he was a creature of circumstance and that had
circumstances been other it is possible he had been a credit to his
name But he was weak in character and out of that weakness he had
developed a Herculean strength in villainy Failure had dogged him in
everything he undertook Broken at the gamingtables hounded out of
town by creditors he was in desperate straits to repair his fortunes
and as we have seen he was not nice in his endeavours to achieve that
end

Ruth Westmacotts fair inheritance had seemed an easy thing to conquer
and to its conquest he had applied himself to suffer defeat as he had
suffered it in all things else But Sir Rowland did not yet acknowledge
himself beaten and the Bridgwater reign of terror dealt him a fresh
handa hand of trumps With this he came boldly to renew the game

He was as smooth as oil at first a very penitent confessing himself
mad in what he had done on that Sunday nightmad with despair and rage
at having been defeated in the noble task to which he had turned his
hands His penitence might have had little effect upon the Westmacotts
had he not known how to insinuate that it might be best for them to lend
an ear to itand a forgiving one

You will tell Mr Westmacott Jasper he had said when Jasper told
him that they could not receive him that he would be unwise not to see
me and the same to Mistress Wilding

And old Jasper had carried his message and had told Richard of the
wicked smile that had been on Sir Rowlands lips when he had uttered it

Now Richard was in many ways a changed man since that night at Weston
Zoyland A transformation seemed to have been wrought in him as odd as
it was sudden and it dated from the moment when with tears in his
eyes he had wrung Wildings hand in farewell Where precept had failed
Richard found himself converted by example He contrasted himself in
that stressful hour with greatsouled Anthony Wilding and saw himself
as he was a weakling strong only in vicious ways Repentance claimed
him repentance and a fine ambition to be worthier to resemble as
nearly as his nature would allow him this Anthony Wilding whom he took
for pattern He changed his ways abandoned drink and gaming and gained
thereby a healthier countenance Then in his zeal he overshot his mark
He developed a taste for Scripturereading bethought him of prayers
and even took to saying grace to his meat Indeedfor conversion
when it comes is a furious thingthe swing of his souls pendulum
threatened now to carry him to extremes of virtue and piety O Lord
he would cry a score of times a day Thou hast brought up my soul from
the grave Thou hast kept me alive that I should not go down to the
pit

But underlying all this remained unfortunately the inherent weakness of
his natureindeed it was that very weakness and malleability made this
sudden and wholesale conversion possible

Upon hearing Sir Rowlands message his heart fainted despite his good
intentions and he urged that perhaps they had better hear what the
baronet might have to say

It was three days after Sedgemoor Fight and poor Ruth was worn and
exhausted with her griefbelieving Wilding dead for he had sent no
message to inform her of his almost miraculous preservation The thing
he went to do in London was fraught with such peril that he foresaw
but the slenderest chance of escaping with his life Therefore he had
argued why console her now with news that he lived when in a few days
the headsman might prove that his end had been but postponed To do so
might be to give her cause to mourn him twice Again he was haunted by
the thought that in spite of all it may have been pity that had so
grievously moved her at their last meeting Better then to wait
better for both their sakes If he came safely through his ordeal it
would be time enough to bear her news of his preservation

In deepest mourning very white with dark stains beneath her eyes
to tell the tale of anguished vigils she received Sir Rowland in the
withdrawingroom her brother at her side To his expressions of
deep penitence he found them cold so he passed on to show them what
disastrous results might ensue upon a stubborn maintaining of this
attitude of theirs towards him

I have come he said his eyes downcast his face longdrawn for he
could play the sorrowful with any hypocrite in England to do something
more than speak of my grief and regret I have come to offer proof of it
by service

We ask no service of you sir said Ruth her voice a sword of
sharpness

He sighed and turned to Richard This were folly he assured his
whilom friend You know the influence I wield

Do I quoth Richard his tone implying doubt

You think that the bungled matter at Newlingtons may have shaken it
quoth Blake With Feversham perhaps But Albemarle remember trusts
me very fully There are ugly happenings in the town here Men are being
hung like linen on a washingday Be not too sure that yourself are
free from all danger Richard paled under the baronets baleful
halfsneering glance Be not in too great haste to cast me aside for
you may find me useful

Do you threaten sir cried Ruth

Threaten quoth he He turned up his eyes and showed the whites of
them Is it to threaten to promise you my protection to show you how I
can serve youthan which I ask no sweeter boon of heaven A word from
me and Richard need fear nothing

He need fear nothing without that word said Ruth disdainfully Such
service as he did Lord Feversham the other night

Is soon forgotten Blake cut in adroitly Indeed twill be most
convenient to his lordship to forget it Think you he would care to have
it known that twas to such a chance he owes the preservation of his
army He laughed and added in a voice of much sly meaning The times
are full of peril Theres Kirke and his lambs And theres no saying
how Kirke might act did he chance to learn what Richard failed to do
that night when he was left to guard the rear at Newlingtons

Would you inform him of it cried Richard between anger and alarm

Blake thrust out his hands in a gesture of horrified repudiation
Richard he cried in deep reproof and again Richard

What other tongue has he to fear asked Ruth

Am I the only one who knows of it cried Blake Oh madam why will
you ever do me such injustice Richard has been my friendmy dearest
friend I wish him so to continue and I swear that he shall find me
his as you shall find me yours

It is a boon I could dispense with she assured him and rose This
talk can profit little Sir Rowland said she You seek to bargain

You shall see how unjust you are he cried with deep sorrow It is
but fitting perhaps after what has passed It is my punishment But
you shall come to acknowledge that you have done me wrong You shall see
how I shall befriend and protect him

That said he took his leave and went but he left behind him a shrewd
seed of fear in Richards mind and of the growth that sprang from it
Richard almost unconsciously transplanted something in the days that
followed into the heart of Ruth As a result to make sure that no harm
should come to her brother the last of his name and race she resolved
to receive Sir Rowland resolved in spite of Dianas outspoken scorn in
spite of Richards protestsfor though afraid yet he would not have it
soin spite even of her own deep repugnance of the man

Days passed and grew to weeks Bridgwater was settling down to peace
againto peace and mourning the Royalist scourge had spread to
Taunton and Blake lingered on at Lupton House an unwelcome but an
undeniable guest

His presence was as detestable to Richard now as it was to Ruth for
Richard had to submit to the mockery with which the town rake lashed his
godly bearing and altered ways More than once in gusts of sudden valour
the boy urged his sister to permit him to drive the baronet from the
house and let him do his worst But Ruth afraid for Richard bade him
wait until the times were more settled When the royal vengeance had
slaked its lust for blood it might matter little perhaps what tales
Sir Rowland might elect to carry

And so Sir Rowland remained and waited He assured himself that he knew
how to be patient and congratulated himself upon that circumstance
Wilding dead a little time must now suffice to blunt the sharp edge of
his widows grief let him but await that time and the rest should be
easy the battle his With Richard he did not so much as trouble himself
to reckon

Thus he determined and thus no doubt he would have acted but for an
unforeseen contingency A miserable paltry creditor had smoked him out
in his Somerset retreat and got a letter to him full of dark hints of
a debtors gaol The fellows name was Swiney and Sir Rowland knew him
for fierce and pertinacious where a defaulting creditor was concerned
One only course remained him to force matters with Wildings widow For
days he refrained fearing that precipitancy might lose him all it was
his wish to do the thing without too much coercion some he was not
coxcomb enough to thinkcoxcomb though he wasmight be dispensed with

At last one Sunday evening he decided to be done with dallying and to
bring Ruth between the hammer and the anvil of his will It was the
last Sunday in July exactly three weeks after Sedgemoor and the
odd coincidence of his having chosen such a day and hour you shall
appreciate anon

They were on the lawn taking the cool of the evening after an
oppressively hot day By the stone seat now occupied by Lady Horton
and Diana Richard lay on the sward at their feet in talk with them
and their talk was of Sir Rowland Dianagall in her soul to see the
baronet by way of gaining yet his endschid Richard in strong terms for
his weakness in submitting to Blakes constant presence at Lupton House
And Richard meekly took her chiding and promised that if Ruth would but
sanction it things should be changed upon the morrow

Sir Rowland all unconsciousreckless indeedof this sauntered with
Ruth some little distance from them having contrived adroitly to draw
her aside He broke a spell of silence with a dolorous sigh

Ruth said he pensively I mind me of the last evening on which you
and I walked here alone

She flashed him a glance of fear and aversion and stood still Under
his brow he watched the quick heave of her bosom the sudden flow and
abiding ebb of blood in her facegrown now so thin and wistfuland he
realized that before him lay no easy task He set his teeth for battle

Will you never have a kindness for me Ruth he sighed

She turned about her intent to join the others a dull anger in her
soul He sat a hand upon her arm Wait said he and the tone in
which he uttered that one word kept her beside him His manner changed a
little I am tired of this said he

Why so am I she answered bitterly

Since we are agreed so far let us agree to end it

It is all I ask

Yes butalasin a different way Listen now

I will not listen Let me go

I were your enemy did I do so for you would know hereafter a sorrow
and repentance for which nothing short of death could offer you escape
Richard is under suspicion

Do you hark back to that The scorn of her voice was deadly Had it
been herself he desired surely that tone had quenched all passion in
him or else transformed it into hatred But Blake was playing for a
fortune for shelter from a debtors prison

It has become known he continued that Richard was one of the early
plotters who paved the way for Monmouths coming I think that that in
conjunction with his betrayal of his trust that night at Newlingtons
thereby causing the death of some twenty gallant fellows of King
Jamess will be enough to hang him

Her hand clutched at her heart What ist you seek she cried It was
almost a moan What ist you want of me

Yourself said he I love you Ruth he added and stepped close up
to her

O God she cried aloud Had I a man at hand to kill you for that
insult

And thenmiracle of miraclesa voice from the shrubs by which they
stood bore to her ears the startling words that told her her prayer was
answered there and then

Madam that man is here

She stood frozen Not more of a statue was Lots wife in the moment of
looking behind her than she who dared not look behind That voice A
voice from the dead a voice she had heard for the last time in the
cottage that was Fevershams lodging at Weston Zoyland Her wild eyes
fell upon Sir Rowlands face It showed livid the netherlip sucked
in and caught in the strong teeth as if to prevent an outcry the eyes
wild with fright What did it mean By an effort she wrenched herself
round at last and a scream broke from her to rouse her aunt her
cousin and her brother and bring them hastening towards her across the
sweep of lawn

Before her on the edge of the shrubbery a grey figure stood erect and
graceful and the face with its thin lips faintly smiling its dark
eyes gleaming was the face of Anthony Wilding And as she stared he
moved forward and she heard the fall of his foot upon the turf the
clink of his spurs the swish of his scabbard against the shrubs and
reason told her that this was no ghost

She held out her arms to him Anthony Anthony She staggered forward
and he was no more than in time to catch her as she swayed

He held her fast against him and kissed her brow Sweet he said
forgive me that I frightened you I came by the orchard gate and my
coming was so timely that I could not hold in my answer to your cry

Her eyelids fluttered she drew a long sighing breath and nestled
closer to him Anthony she murmured again and reached up a hand to
stroke his face to feel that it was truly living flesh

And Sir Rowland realizing too by now that here was no ghost
recovered his lost courage He put a hand to his sword then withdrew
it leaving the weapon sheathed Here was a hangmans job not a
swordsmans he opinedand wisely for he had had earlier experience of
Mr Wildings play of steel

He advanced a step O fool he snarled The hangman waits for you

And a creditor for you Sir Rowland came the voice of Mr Trenchard
who now pushed forward through those same shrubs that had masked his
friends approach A Mr Swiney Twas I sent him from town Hes
lodged at the Bull and bellows like one when he speaks of what you owe
him There are three messengers with him and they tell of a debtors
gaol for you sweetheart

A spasm of fury crossed the face of Blake They may have me and
welcome when Ive told my tale said he Let me but tell of Anthony
Wildings lurking here and not only Anthony Wilding but all the rest
of you are doomed for harbouring him You know the law I think he
mocked them for Lady Horton Diana and Richard who had come up
stood now a pace or so away in deepest wonder You shall know it better
before the night is out and better still before next Sundays come

Tush said Trenchard and quoted Theres none but Anthony may
conquer Anthony

Tis clear said Wilding you take me for a rebel An odd mistake
For it chances Sir Rowland that you behold in me an accredited servant
of the Secretary of State

Blake stared then fell a prey to ironic laughter He would have spoken
but Mr Wilding plucked a paper from his pocket and handed it to
Trenchard

Show it him said he and Blakes face grew white again as he read the
lines above Sunderlands signature and observed the seals of office He
looked from the paper to the hated smiling face of Mr Wilding

You were a spy he said his tone making a question of the odious
statement A dirty spy

Your incredulity is flattering at least said Wilding pleasantly as
he repocketed the parchment and it leads you in the right direction I
neither was nor am a spy

That paper proves it cried Blake contemptuously Having been a spy
himself he was a good judge of the vileness of the office

See to my wife Nick said Wilding sharply and made as if to transfer
her to the care of his friend

Nay said Trenchard tis your own duty that Let me discharge the
other for you And he stepped up to Blake and tapped him briskly on the
shoulder Sir Rowland said he youre a knave Sir Rowland stared
at him Youre a foul thinga muckwormSir Rowland added Trenchard
amiably and youve been discourteous to a lady for which may Heaven
forgive youI cant

Stand aside Blake bade him hoarse with passion blind to all risks
My affair is with Mr Wilding

Aye said Trenchard but mine is with you If you survive it you can
settle what other affairs you pleaseincluding belike your business
with Mr Swiney

Not so Nick said Wilding suddenly and turned to Richard Here
Richard Take her he bade his brotherinlaw

Anthony you damned shirkduty see to your wife Leave me to my own
diversions Sir Rowland he reminded the baronet I have called you a
knave and a foul thing and faith if you want it proven you need but
step down the orchard with me

He saw hesitation lingering in Sir Rowlands face and he uncurled the
last of the whip he carried Id grieve to do a violent thing before
the ladies he murmured deprecatingly Id never respect myself again
if I had to drive a gentleman of your quality to the ground of honour
with a horsewhip But as Gods my life if you dont go willingly this
instant tis what will happen

Richards newborn righteousness prompted him to interfere to seek to
avert this threatened bloodshed his humanity urged him to let matters
be and his humanity prevailed Diana watched this foreshadowing of
tragedy with tight lips pale cheeks Justice was to be done at last
it seemed and as her frightened eye fell upon Sir Rowland she knew not
whether to exult or weep Her motherunderstanding nothingplied her
meanwhile with whispered questions

As for Sir Rowland he looked into the old rakes eyes agleam with
wicked mirth and rage welled up to choke him He must kill this man

Come said he Ill see to your fine friend Wilding afterwards

Excellent said Trenchard and led the way through the shrubbery to
the orchard

Ruth reviving looked up Her glance met Mr Wildings it quickened
into understanding and she stirred Is it true Is it really true
she cried I am being tortured by this dream again

Nay sweet it is true it is true I am here Say shall I stay

She clung to him for answer And you are in no danger

In none sweet I am Mr Wilding of Zoyland Chase free to come and go
as best shall seem to me He begged the others to leave them a little
while and he led her to the stone seat by the river He set her at his
side there and told her the story of his escape from the firingparty
and of the inspiration that had come to him on the morrow to make use
of the letter in his boot which Sunderland had given him for Monmouth
in the hour of panic Monmouths cavalier treatment of him when he had
arrived in Bridgwater had precluded his delivering that letter at the
council There was never another opportunity nor did he again think of
the package in the stressful hours that followed It was not until the
following morning that he suddenly remembered it lay undelivered and
bethought him that it might prove a weapon to win him delivery from the
dangers that encompassed him

It was a slender chance he told her but I employed it I waited in
London in hiding close upon a fortnight ere I had an opportunity of
seeing Sunderland He laughed me to scorn at first and threatened me
with the Tower But I told him the letter was in safe hands and would
remain there in earnest of his good behaviour and that did he have me
arrested it would instantly be laid before the King and bring his own
head to the block more surely even than my own It frightened him but
it had scarcely done so sweet had he known that that precious letter
was still in my boot for my boot was on my leg and my leg was in the
room with the rest of me

He surrendered at last and gave me papers proving that Trenchard
and Ifor I stipulated for old Nicks safety toowere His Majestys
accredited agents in the West I loathed the title Buthe spread
his hands and smiledit was that or widowing you

She took his face in her hands and stroked it fondly and they sat thus
until a dry cough behind them roused them from their joyous silence Mr
Trenchard was sauntering towards them his left eye tucked farther under
his hat than usual his hands behind him

Tis a thirsty evening he informed them

Go tell Richard so said Wilding who knew naught of Richards
altered ways

Ive thought of it but haply hes sensitive on the score of drinking
with me again He has done it twice to his undoing

Hell do it a third time no doubt said Mr Wilding curtly and
Trenchard taking the hint turned with a shrug and went up the lawn
towards the house He found Richard in the porch where he had
lingered fearfully waiting for news At sight of Mr Trenchards grim
weatherbeaten countenance he came forward suddenly

How has it sped he asked his lips twitching on the words

Yonder they sit said Trenchard pointing down the lawn

No no I mean Sir Rowland

Oh Sir Rowland cried the old sinner as though Sir Rowland were
some matter long forgotten He sighed Alas poor Swiney I fear Ive
cheated him

You mean

Art slow at inference Dick Sir Rowland has passed away in the odour
of villainy

Richard clasped nervous hands together and raised his colourless eyes to
heaven

May the Lord have mercy on his soul said he

May He indeed said Trenchard when he had recovered from his
surprise But he added pessimistically I doubt the rogues in
hell

Richards eyes kindled suddenly and he quoted from the thirtieth Psalm
I will extol thee O Lord for Thou hast lifted me up and hast not
made my foes to rejoice over me

Dumbfounded wondering indeed was Westmacotts mind unhinged
Trenchard scanned him narrowly Richard caught the glance and
misinterpreted it for one of reproof He bethought him that his joy was
unrighteous He stifled it and forced his lips to sigh Poor Blake

Poor indeed quoth Trenchard and adapted a remembered line of his
playacting days to suit the case The tears live in an onion that
shall water his grave Though perhaps I am forgetting Swiney Then
in a brisker tone Come Richard What like is the muscadine you keep
at Lupton House

I have abjured all wine said Richard

A plague you have quoth Trenchard understanding less and less Have
you turned Mussulman perchance

No answered Richard sternly Christian

Trenchard hesitated rubbing his nose thoughtfully Hum said he at
length Peace be with you then Ill leave you here to bay the moon
to your hearts content Perhaps Jasper will know where to find me a
brainwash And with a final suspicious wondering look at the whilom
bibber he passed into the house much exercised on the score of the
sanity of this family into which his friend Anthony had married

Outside the twilight shadows were deepening

Shall we home sweet whispered Mr Wilding The shadows befriended
her a veil for her sudden confusion She breathed something that seemed
no more than a sigh though more it seemed to Anthony Wilding

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array
of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations 1 to
5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks online payments and credit card donations To donate
